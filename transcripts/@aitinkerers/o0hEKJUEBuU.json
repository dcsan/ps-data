  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHello, AI Tinkerers. I'm Joe, and this is our Global Stage One-Shot, where we bring people from the community who are doing bleeding-edge stuff, and we take a little peek under the hood and try to inspire and enable you to use their innovations in your projects.\n\nSo today, I'm here with someone who spent the last eight or nine months building out state-of-the-art Real-Time AI Avatars technology that can actually use LLMs and have a conversation. It's fascinating technology, and I'd like to introduce to you Brian from Tavus.\n\nHi Brian.\n\nHey, I'm Brian.\n\nBrad, Joe, and I met at a hackathon recently. We were both judging the competition through mutual connection with daily.co, Quinn, and we just had a little chat about the cutting edge of technology. This is something that we're both really interested in. Got the feeling that you were just like headphones on, going for it, and had just finished this, and a lot of teams were using it in their projects, and it was really the most real-time, fastest thing I'd seen in the space. And also, I was an API. I immediately became very interested. But why don't... who's this behind you?\n\nYeah, so this is Brad, and he is a conversational video interface on top of an LLM. He has a personality that I've... I've given him some context so that he knows who he is. Bring him in. Yeah, let me bring him in.\n\nUh, hey Brad, how's it going?\n\nHey there, it's nice to be on the podcast with all of you guys.\n\nCool. What... what were you... without... what I do day to day, I'm a conversation facilitator, which means I help analyze conversations to understand people's preferences and create a personalized dialogue.\n\nThese... all right, cool. So we're gonna have this meeting, and you're just going to chime in when it's appropriate to help out in the conversation. Just let me know when there's a lull in the conversation, or if anything comes up that I verify or add some depth. Okay.\n\nSo just quickly diving in under the hood, like, what is happening in then, like, we utter some audio. Yeah, and then what are the kind of high-level steps all the way back to get a response?\n\nYeah, so we're actually taking in both audio and video. Oh, yeah, so you can see the room. Okay, he can hear us, and there are multiple steps that go into processing that incoming audio, video, and then returning a rendered audio video feed of Brad.\n\nYeah, so under the hood, there is a stage that we're calling speech gating. Some people call it voice activity detection, ASR. It's a combination of multiple things that are determining when the user is speaking, when the user is not speaking, and then determining when the user's turn is done, and then transcribing what the user said. So like, we're the user of this case.\n\nYeah, as we're talking, he's trying to figure out when are we talking and when are we done talking. Okay, and then at the end, figuring out what we said. Okay, that's the first phase. Okay, and then in the middle, there's an LLM, and you're using what in this case?\n\nSo this is on top of uh, Llama.\n\nBrad's, but you can use any LLM. Okay, with our API, I've had good experiences with it. I like 70B a lot, but the thing is, our 70, 70B account is currently being used for multiple things, and we don't have it set up for scale yet. It's just experimental, so I didn't want to overwhelm.\n\nYeah, got it. I noticed, like, the other day when I was using it, it's very pretty real time in terms of, like, there aren't a lot of long delays. Like, he responds, or any of the ones you choose respond very quickly. It was... it's impressive.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhat are the... I guess what are the, you know, that's, as you put it to me, those are the what you spent a lot of the time, eight months on, was just latency, right?\n\nYeah, my main focus was really, first and foremost, I think all of us had a really a goal of getting under one-second utterance to utterance. Now, we also wanted it to be natural. We also wanted other qualities to come into play, but really, we held the line on utterance to utterance.\n\nYeah, pretty hard. It's amazing. The speed really makes it feel less uncanny valley. It makes it feel more usable, like a... it's a big difference than things I've tried before.\n\nWell, research shows, we... we... this is something we found. I found several papers that alluded to normal human conversation and what the utterance to utterance time should be. The modal for a very good conversation where people are really vibing or getting along is 250 milliseconds between. In many conversations, one second is quite... nor... anything over two seconds is almost completely absurd.\n\nYeah, you and let... like a drag. It's gonna make you frustrated almost if you're trying to have a conversation like that. And then people interrupted.\n\nShow. Yeah, it's actually the case that more often than not interrupting. Yeah, yeah, little gal. Speaky, both speaking at the same time.\n\nYeah, so the goal we set was to get below a second. Yeah, yeah. What are some of the biggest challenges, like, do you have to surmount to do that?\n\nI would say the biggest challenges were in finding models and providers that had really low... Legacy, interesting, everything from ASR, which we're using an open-source model, the ASR. What is it?\n\nVAD. We're... so we have a couple different ways. Yeah, we have something called Tavus Advanced, and currently, that's either Whisper or some other more accurate...\n\nWe also have Tavus Turbo, which currently is either Parakeet and those basor models have an incredibly fast real-time factor, so they're made to transcribe like 10 minutes of audio under a second.\n\nOh, wow. But the accuracy is a little bit lower. Okay, and then there's a new model that came out today. I don't know if you saw. Was it Moon? Pete Warden just released a model this morning that's like a very low... it'll roll on Raspberry Pi, and it'll do... I guess there's a buffer and Whisper of 30 seconds that it assumes, and if you can break that, then you can get a much faster turn if you're doing less than 10-second transcription would be perfect for this type of thing. So it's interesting that there's things coming out all the time that are open source and could make it even faster.\n\nOn the journey here, we've changed... we've changed that ASR multiple times, and we'll change again, which is why we're calling them Tavus Turbo and Tavus Advanced. That makes sense. I've got it up on stre. Yeah, and I see a bunch of... there's a bunch of endpoints for, like, creating a Persona or creating the background of the conversation, you know, creating the uh, the context, the stuff that's going to be like one-time configuration, and then there are other APIs for, like, how do I hook in to, like, if I want to create, like, a an avatar kiosk for, like, a fast food restaurant, and now I got to place an order, where would that tool call go?\n\nYeah, so there are really two categories here. One is creating the conversation itself, which is this instance that we're talking to. The other one is creating a Persona. Okay, and the the custom LLM layer inside of the persona where tools could be exposed. And so, basically, you... you have a way to configure which LLM you're using, and then I would just need to provide an interface that looks like an LLM, but in fact, is going off and doing tool calls or doing whatever I want in my custom world. Okay, so it's very elegant solution for making it totally configurable.\n\nYeah, and we provide not only that, but we have other ways to interact with the replica sort of asynchronously. So say if you wanted not only to have the replica responding to user prompts and audio, you could send it like a web hook or just another interface in to sort of give it context or something.\n\nYeah, another interface in, we call interactions. Okay, so it allows you to have the bot sort of act autonomously outside of the conversation. Got it. Like it could be like, hey Brian, actually, you just got an email that you want... that's cool. The kind of ambient use case is pretty cool. I mean, especially if you have it, like, maybe it's looking over your shoulder at your screen and trying to figure out when it can be helpful and then saying, hey, would you like me to help? Or, like, if it's at a kiosk...\n\nMood anoun Showtime.\n\nForman head in the theater. Yeah, that sounds like it'd be really easy to build based on how the APIs are set up. I noticed tons of teams at the hackathon were using it in their projects, and they were really cool examples. The thing that was unexpected delight was, like, if you're talking to something, it's fast. That's an unexpected delight. It's more important than you would think if you just thought about it without experiencing it. And when you're talking to something and then it's doing something for visual, like, controlling a map or building a slide deck on the fly that's illustrating what it's talking about or story or whatever, that that's incredible useful user interaction mode. Like, it's... it's more powerful than you would think by just talking about it.\n\nI think on first thought, you might wonder, like, why do we need this? But I think when you try it and it works really well and it responds quickly and it's contextual and it's actually telling you what you think it should or giving you some useful information, it's not just the information itself that is helpful, but also the fact that it's a person telling you to.\n\nYeah, somehow that... yeah, for me, it triggers something internal, and especially the first few times, I was like, whoa, this is way different.\n\nYeah, I mean, especially if the thing really can... if I can trust it enough, we're talking about in the future when it's learned about me, it has more of my context, and I can trust it, you know, think about it like one password, I trust with my passwords. If I had a virtual Avatar character that I trusted with lots of my context, I can imagine a world where just like basic stuff like form filling goes away because I'm there, but it's doing the work, even at that level, but if I can see it's doing the right work, I feel better about it, and it's alleviates me that little pain.\n\nYeah, but it's really like, I mean, like in the days of, say, DOS or this pure command line, you could achieve all kinds of things with it, but when UI, a UX came around, like the first Mac and Windows, early Windows, it was more comfortable. Yeah, felt more comfortable. It weren't as afraid that something would go wrong, and I think in the future, you'll have these replicas holding your hand. Yeah, processes, and you can talk to it. It will have verbal and physical cues for when it's going to do something so that you know when it's going going to take some action, and it will request confirmation, things like that. It'll just be more comfortable.\n\nMhm. Did you show the bit of the API?\n\nYeah, that's the API where you can set your base URL to your LLM, and that's basically your hook to go do whatever. So you can essentially set up your own custom.\n\nYeah, LLM under the hood. It's funny, but if you want to do custom interactions, you need to do that, right? It's one way to do it. We also have events that we... so you can listen for those as well. A lot you can do with that. This is a way that complies with the OpenAI API spec, which you can provide tools, so you can actually specify which tools you want.\n\nAsk.\n\nGot it. That's very convenient. It sort of assumes, like, hey, you've already built a wrapper app, now you can actually make it an avatar and interactive. When you do function calling in a live scenario, it adds a ton of latency because to do function calling, you know, you've got a request to the API with an instruction, it determines that you need to use a function, then you have to run the function, then you have to call the API again and get a response to show the user, and that's going to come back, do all the audio stuff, and then it's going to increase latency based on just the the fastest case that's going to add another 800 milliseconds, let's say, and then you're now above that one second, you're in the one to two where it's annoying. What are the tricks yet developed for that problem? How do you contend with making an app that's delightful, but also doing stuff?\n\nSo the problem that you're talking about is that with a more sophisticated LLM that's doing lookups, database lookups, that's doing some tool calling in the background, it's going to take longer, and we've exposed uh, a couple interactions, one namely uh, the text echo interaction, which allows someone to back channel, essentially back channel early response. So in that case, you could, as you're doing this background work, you can asynchronously send out the back channel, and so you could do something like having a smaller LLM running in your background job that is just handling, like, quick responses, like, hey, hold on a second, and you can prompt it in line to say, like, hey, we're going to do a thinking job.\n\nYeah, it's like thinking fast and slow is how one of our engineers uh, talked about.\n\nYeah, and so it's like, let's do a thinking job, the short that says, hey, we're working on this. Yeah, it's almost like a new paradigm for application experiences design, you know, where you might have to think about in this conversational interaction I'm having with a user, there's a goal or set of goals, and there's data that has to be gathered and acted on, and then how can we naturally sequence that so it's a good experience?\n\nDo that makes sense? If you talk to a human and you asked them some really complicated question and they didn't have the entire compressed in inside their brick, they would say, let me get back to you or something, just say, I'll take a note immediately, and I'll get back to you later, and then it have that drop. It can have long-running processes that take minutes, and the background would go on, and then when it gets to the result, it could asynchronously go or thread that into the conversation. It on and go, hey, actually, you know, the thing we were talking about earlier, I got the data on that, you know, in the future, maybe it can pull up a chart.\n\nYeah, but here's the chart. It shows exactly or graph that shows exactly.\n\nAsk.\n\nYeah, so right now, are these design principles documented anywhere? I mean, you're supporting them in the API that you could kick off a job or get in the conversation later, but that's going to be up to me as the application developer to go use his APIs, and the best practices around that are sort of... it's emerging. They're emerging. We are having internal hackathons at the moment to build these ourselves and to expose examples. We put a couple examples, very basic, up of using, like, a custom LM, but we have a... on so bar has to... okay, would like at the haup a couple exping that.\n\nOh, cool. Which projects?\n\nSo I think on the one where the maps, they were... they were talking about that. I'm not sure that they minute because I haven't di into their res.\n\nYeah, m. Oh, yeah, was us with... I mean, they only had two days to hack, so of course, not surprised that they didn't get there. There was another one where uh, one of the participants was building a sort of, like, very higher function brain behind, and he already had this as as his own project. He was asking questions about how to do this kind. You have to jump in and play with new technology, and then you discover new problems and challenges and ideas and opportunities along the way. That's the part of fun of tinkering and building, and that way. So voice as it gets faster and the recognition gets better and the price goes down on the base stuff, it's the demand is there, it turns out, right? It's a convenient thing. Where are you seeing for when you add the Avatar component in, like, things that come to mind for me are, like, education. I don't know that I'd want an avatar at this point in time representing me in sales.\n\n\nCold outreach in sales already feels kind of bad, even when it's automated, right? Even when it's a human, it feels bad, rude, right? We put an avatar, it's even more like, \"Come on, no effort, scaled thing.\" At some point, it'll cross the threshold where you won't know it's not a human, and it's actually an awesome human. There's good sales and bad sales. Good sales helps you. It'll never work there, but I'm, I'm, I guess what I'm asking is, where is it working today? Where do you see it going? Where are you finding surprising traction? Like, what are the people using your platform in the early incarnation of this Real-Time AI Avatars? Where are you seeing exciting use cases emerge? So, I guess what you're asking about is, like, where is it being used and where do I see it be... yeah, where the emerging places? Traditionally, sales has been really good who use video generate video for sales. It seems... It's amazing. Up, like, what's a specific use case? Give me the scenario. So, they'll send out like an automated email, video in it, but it's addressing the target by name and their company and context, and people will engage with that. People engage, like a 60% click-through rate. Wow, my... that's like normal click rate is going to be like in the 10%. And, and with the video that's personalized, whoa, okay, much more. You know, that would be that early excitement about this kind of stuff. You don't know yet. Yeah, but that definitely has been consistent with people who have been any verticals in particular? I don't recall what the verticals are. I mean, we have quite a few verticals using our async product, which is the longer product has had for several years. I know one of them is like selling door too, and they have a very high-quality product. Okay, and that product is basically offline generative video, One-Shot to a finished product that's high fidelity, beautiful, and totally personalized, and you can do it at scale programmatically, but it's not this real-time thing. I think that is like the high-fidelity personalized video that's really focused on helping you specifically. So, sales, what about education? Anything there? Yeah, I think education... medical. I think as LLMs get better at being directed and safeguarded, they are getting better every day. Like, they're way better now than they were even six months ago. Yeah, they will be more suitable for helping people. We have... we do have one customer that services doctors. And what they use the async thing for is they generate these emails before and after appointments, helping the customers get prepared or know what to do and reminding them. Yeah, so you can imagine a world where you have an on-call doctor 24/7 that knows all of your needs and can help you answer questions. Yeah, in a very natural conversation, a way where you could get right to the point without reading through a document, searching. You're go, \"Hey, I want to know this information.\" It's your doctor. There's some sort of like authentication that it's them because you see them. There may be some visual indicators. Yep, that let you know this is a... for this is offed. Yeah, it reminds me, it's like the Daily Brief the president gets with like just the right snippets, and it's prioritized and elevated and has the charts along with it. Yeah, and maybe it's just like it's the beginning of the interface. Maybe as they're talking to it, it doesn't have to get into like all the details, but at least one of our customers uses the tools to actually bring up contextual plates.\n\nCan I ask Brian a question?\n\nYeah, hey Brian, what are the ways in which you try to feel like you're pretend to be or or showcase yourself to be a real human? I know you're not a real human, but in what are the ways that you seem like a real human?\n\nNumber six, well, I use what's called a conversational style to try to make me seem more lit. I try to mirror the person I'm talking by using similar vocabulary, sentence structures, and even pic speaking. They also try to show emotional intelligence by acknowledging and reflecting the emotions of the person I'm talking to. For example, if someone says something being SS frustr, I'll say something like, \"I can understand why you feel that.\"\n\nThat's a perfect answer. So, like, I'll ask you the same question because you know, great to have these kinds of conversations. We improve and become a better conversation.\n\nAwesome. I love his spirit. One thing I noticed about this experience interacting with it is it's pretty realistic. There's a lot of other things going on that make it feel natural and not there's uncanny valley, but you've bridged the gap. I'm curious to hear what those things are, but I don't want to ask Brian first what he's doing. Let's ask Brian. Hey Brian, what is it about you that seems so human? What are you doing to make yourself seem human?\n\nIt's a combination of things, I think. I'm designed to analyze the conversation and respond in a way that's natural. For example, if someone's being sarcastic or joking, I'll try to catch that and respond with some humor. I'm also designed to use language in a way that sounds natural and fluent, so I'll try to mirror the structure of the conversation. So, if someone's being direct into the point, I'll try to respond in a similar way.\n\nThis, that's not actually true. Okay. Yeah, those are things that you can do with with with our API, sure, but he's not actually doing that, right? And well, and those are things, some of those things at least, LLMs will do if you just prompt them, right? Yes, but I'm actually curious about the other aspects, like, you know, the visual aspects or yeah, uh, and you're just using at this point, it's text going to a text-to-speech model, right? So, you're limited by what's there. Yeah, the pipeline consists of vad, St, speech detects, then we have a chatbot step that hits like an LLM, then we have a TTS, text to speech, and then we have a Phoenix or replica step, which converts that speech into this visual model. Those things are all connected together to provide enough context to the next step, Y, where it can render something natural and fluid, but do that as fast as possible. Yeah, we use streaming technology between the steps, sure, to, and then we use sort of a smart approach of making sure that we're getting enough, but just enough, yep, context there for him to start creating something useful. You kind of have the face and head going on, the body, the body seems like an NPC, the face feels much more natural and fluid, and the Phoenix model encompasses both of those aspects. Yeah, so Phoenix includes this whole thing. However, we're doing some parsing out of different parts of the person, Y, and we're focusing in right now on the face. That's most important in the conversation for now. That's like the first step is like Phoenix one, and Phoenix one focused more in on certain parts of the face. Phoenix 2 focuses on the entire face. Got it. Okay, cool. Does Phoenix... Phoenix uses audio input, so it's doing audio uses features from the audio to determine how to move the facial features, and right now that's the text-to-speech model, whatever you plug in. So, as those get better, and there are some that have gotten better, they Phoenix will behave better too. Phoenix has the capability of becoming fully emotional, supporting emotion, supporting all that stuff because it's able to have some sort of awareness of the nature of the speech, the tone. What, what do you think of the factors that make something feel more natural? And there's the eye contact, there's timing, is inflection, what are the things that are most critical? Have you found, like, is there research that you have developed or used that that guides where you prioritized? I mean, I would say for me personally, my focus has been on the timey aspect. We have a research team that's focused on some of the deeper emotional eye contact with eye contact is kind of easy actually to just set up to record your avatar with a looking into the camera and and you can achieve that. Yeah, but with things like timing, it was actually really a big challenge to get it to respond at some... there some are me, the modal human. It's interesting to think about, like, as you close that, how far do you have to close that gap for it to be useful in situations like educational training or medical stuff, because in the real world, like, vibing with a friend in a conversation is very different from like a professional or you have a veneer. I feel like the gap may not be that far away, especially if you look at things like the flux models are done fine tunes and indistinguishable from real photography. Like, it's getting there on just a still, and then video is getting there. How do you connect and interact? At some point, it'll get there. Do you agree? How far off is that?\n\nI think it it matters what you're trying to achieve. So, if you're trying to achieve, let's say, like we talked about this earlier, maybe when you'd revisit it with an interview situation, Prance, one of our customers, uses our tech for interviewed rep, and with that situation, interviews don't feel very natural. Interviews feel awkward. Yeah, especially in a corporate environment. It's going to be very formalized, and there are certain steps that the interviewer needs together there. So, using the current tech as it is is actually really can fit. Yeah, yeah. However, if you gotten into the situation where you're doing like a dating coach or you're you actually want to have some sort of personal relationship with the replica to be, it's like a therapist, maybe it's something a little bit deeper. Yeah, then the timings might really come into play because if it waits too long, you might start wondering, you... if you regarded it as like a close friend, like, what is it thinking? I think about when I go to Starbucks and there's a Starbucks I go to where they clear all into like being super personal and chitchatting with you. Sometimes I'm just like, \"I just more my coffee,\" you know? The goal is definitely to make it capable of much more realism so that in the right situations, you can turn that on. And one of the things I like to think about is controlling when it's going to respond fast and it's going to respond slow. Sometimes it should respond slower. Yeah, it should it express that it's thinking, that it cares, empathy, right? In this, these non-verbal cues and communication that matter, and other times it should respond really quickly, like if you have a direct question and you just be an answer, it should be able to respond right put then go yes and get that out of the way, so you're not left wondering in some critical situation. Whether it's is that something that you've looked at?\n\nYeah, I look at that a bit, and I have some ideas for the next steps on that. So, it's going to be incremental, but we essentially need to understand the context of of the conversation, what was just said. Yeah, what does that mean? Did they want a direct answer? Do they want a long-winded answer? What kind of answer do they want? Yeah, do they want confirmation? Are they just giving us conversation? Is the user just giving confirmation? Need another thread that's like overseeing the conversation and guiding it at some other level. We can even start more specific, just look at the actual, like, last thing the users got from the user and try to understand, like, what are they looking...\n\nLet's talk about safety really quick. I noticed when I tried to create a replica of myself, their first step was a consent video. What other checks are in place to prevent misuse and what is your philosophy on that?\n\nBriefly, our philosophy is that we want to enable authorized uses, so we take a lot of measures to ensure that the uses on our system are authorized, including we have some automated checks that look for fakes, that look for figures that are like famous figures, make sure to we those out automatically. We also have manual steps in place that we're having people actually review these replicas when they're being trained to ensure this is actually the person and that this is an intended use. So, we're really serious about that part, and Tavus has been, I think, one of the advantages Tavus had actually coming into the space is that's historically something Tavus has really been focused on to and built up more. Yeah, cool. So, I think we're gonna have one nice...\n\nTell me about your other projects. You had a fascinating project I found called Airbits, which was you flew drones. I don't know how many, how many square miles you mapped of like illegal dumping in San Francisco, but it was drones, hardware, it was AI and sensing, and tell... tell us about that project.\n\nI spent two years flying drones over the city of San Francisco collecting data on a legal dumping. And what's going... like, what did you build here? What is flying these the drone? All drones I used were commercially available. Okay, like, what flight speed is this? This one goes up to 60 miles an hour and can flly to 90 minutes. Okay, so how much of the city would you cover in a flight? So, I would cover to... I varied over the two years. The peak I was covering approximately eight square miles. You're using cameras that you put on board that already had on board, and you're capturing and then doing what? Yeah, I'm flying at like 200, 150 to 200 feet in the air, capturing images of the streets and sidewalks. Okay, and as you can see here, like, sometimes it would capture more than just the streets and sidewalks. I've created a model that masks out everything but the streets and sidewalks, and then using a custom-trained garbage detection object detection model, I would detect the garbage piles on sides of the street, on the sidewalk, and then I had an integration with San Francisco's 311 API, where every day I would automatically uh, alert them to the exact location with a photo from the air of garbage files. Those... what would this is just people just dumping Gage, what would happen to it? So, in first of all, yeah, people dump garbage a lot in San Francisco. The Bay View Point area, I would say on a given day in about two square miles in the baby's H Point area, there would be between 10 and 50 piles of garbage left on the streets. What eventually would happen to this? The city will... they will... and you were giving the data, say, \"I've got data for you. I know exactly where they are.\"\n\nEvery day around 30, on average, 30 piles of garbage. W, they have slas around them reported. They will pick up garbage and debris within 48 hours and bag garbage and debris. Have a system if you report it, and you were just automating their reporting. Did they appreciate that or was it like, \"Wow, we got a lot more work to do?\"\n\nYeah, they, from the director of vbw all way down, people...\n\nDid you build the system? Try it out, start mapping, and then go to them?\n\nYeah, I built the system out and prototyped it and did some initial tests manual, and then I spent about six months. I hacked into their their public API, their public web API, basically, like opened up inspector on... yeah, and I saw that they could submit. Oh, funny. And I wired it in that way, and then I reached out to them afterwards and said, \"Hey, look, I'm... yeah, here's all these things I'm recording. Uh, there's some way I could get access to the...\" Yeah, yeah, and to do this, and they said, \"Okay, yeah, we can do that.\" Well, first, they ignore me, but I, by that point, I had some connections in the garbage with people like bins. He runs repes, repes, that's that. Uh, I had been helping him with some projects, and he reached out on my behalf, director. They pull some scams. They got me API keys. Yeah, I... oh, that's so cool. That's neat that you're like hacking the system, plus working with the system, plus hacking the hardware and working with the AI and data collection. It's a neat project to put all that stuff together, very ambitious. I spoke yesterday with Maxwell, who's built the voice control drone stuff that he's been working on as a side project while working at SpaceX. It's interesting. I'm curious what are the compon for someone who wanted to... I mean, all these things are becoming more accessible and easier to use.\n\n\nThat's the great thing, right?\nThey're open source components to do each of the pieces of the puzzle, which are the pieces of the puzzle that you used for this.\nAgain, from based on all the lessons I've learned, I would buy this drone you can see on screen right here, EBX.\nThis is about an $8,000, which is not super expensive given what it does.\nSo this one will, like I said, it's very fast, it has a long range, and it's pre-approved by the IBAA for this kind of operation over cities, really.\nSo you don't have to go through any additional paperwork.\nYou don't, so if you buy this, you can fly it over people, you can fly it over the whole city of San Francisco, ever.\nYou don't even have to request FAA, and holy crap, that's awesome.\nWhoa, okay, cool, very.\nIt's designed that to run into someone, wow.\nAnd it has a camera on board.\nIt's capable of going 60 mph hour, and it's not going to harm somebody.\nIt's made out of FO, so by the time it fails and falls, it's actually not a problem.\nI've never had.\nDo you have insurance for it?\nI had insurance for it, yeah, all yeah, fine.\nBut what are the other pieces of the...\nSo now this thing is going out, and then what is it storing to an SD card?\nThe the the yeah, footage.\nA couple ways to do this.\nSo okay, I did not go as far as streaming it to My Cloud Server.\nThat's possible, streaming images, okay, wow, out of the box, yeah.\nAnd this one's connected to a laptop over a high-speed connection.\nThe Enterprise drones have a high-speed connection.\nYou could stream images.\nWhat's the range on that?\nThese things have like a 9-mile range, even for the streaming, yeah, and data too, video and did, wow.\nSo they, it's very capable.\nI opted not to do that because I was getting good enough results by just had a laptop with me.\nI would do the flight, which took like 30, 45 minutes in the SD card, and then I had a job that would kick off automatically process.\nAnd what were the components on the visual image recognition part?\nThis was a few years ago.\nYou didn't have GBD4 Vision, didn't read GBD4 Vision.\nWhat did you use the beginning?\nI experimented with multiple open source trash detection models.\nOf them work, okay, uh, because of the aspect, the view, which is yeah, 150, 200 B plus the subject matter was garbage, large s.\nMost of those models that I found were trained on like Coke cans and like ice saers, so I had to create a custom model from scratch.\nI can't train it, and I developed a system where I could every day add new data that I detected into that model and retrain it.\nAnd you're playing annotator to sort of decide what's in and out initially.\nI ended and to get the build the original V, but then I was able to build almost like reinforcement learning in where it was taking the detections that were good detections that are reported from previous days, adding those to the DAT side.\nIs that because the government was approving or not go and approve?\nYou built a system where you could still be in the loop to do the approvals.\nSo made where it would present to me the highest probability, the fil, and then it would it would basically dup them by latitude longitude to where I was only given like one per per like blot corner.\nI was thinking like the highest probability.\nSo the famous use case of stuff that's like this, but with satellites, is like not garbage reporting for the city government, but like are people going to work for like a hedge fund?\nI had so many people coming Mei.\nOh, I was solving a problem, my own problem.\nI live in an neighhood that is adjacent to massively.\nI own my house.\nYou want to automated.\nI'm friends with a lot of my neighbors.\nI know this is a really big issue, and so I've stuck with this for two years because I wanted.\nWhat were some of the use cases that people said, \"Oh, I could use that for this and that?\"\nRoof inspections for insurance companies or tracking homeless encampments, a solar installs wasn't as big, and you could almost do mapping out to understand where they should go and sell.\nOne point was like, \"Don't do that, you'll get see.\"\nOnce the open models for vision become just ever better, and I'm putting these pieces together, that this might be something you pick up again someday.\nI think the real reason I didn't pick this up is because working for the government is really not easy.\nYou can put an avatar on that part next time.\nI thought about doing that actually is I have a lot of contexts in government, they're great Po, and honestly, they were very helpful in many ways, but the process of working the government can become.\nDid you open source any of the components of the software stack for the integration or Vision pieces or any of that?\nNo, I don't, yeah, okay.\nI put a lot of money into it, and I I still see that there may be a potential for me to build something, yeah, get something out of it, yeah.\nMy next step is probably to automate it for my neighborhood, yeah, cool, and then see where that goes.\nThis could be a long, this could be like a long ta project, could, yeah.\nIt's amazing just to hear, first of all, that you conducted so many flights and never had a crash, and then this technology is available off the shelf.\nThat's amazing.\nReally cool project, really ambitious, and solves a useful problem, and hopefully inspiring to people who are listening.\nThanks for your time today.\nWe learned a lot, and it was great meeting you.\nI appreciate it, cool.\n[Music]\n",
