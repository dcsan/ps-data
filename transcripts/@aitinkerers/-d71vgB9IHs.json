This is our global stage where the true innovators come and share what they've learned with you, hopefully to enable your projects. And a couple weeks ago, we had a big hackathon here in Seattle, sponsored by Anthropic, uh, where we were exploring Humans-in-the-loop agentic systems. And so today, we thought it'd be interesting to do an episode with the winner of the hackathon, Varun Pant. Varun, welcome.\n\nYeah, thanks, Joe, for having me.\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself.\n\nBeen here in Seattle for 5 years, working at AWS all that while, uh, joined as an IC, and then, uh, over the last 3 years, I've been a manager and wearing multiple hats.\n\nDo you still code?\n\nYeah, I still code.\n\nThat's how we want, just kidding. Was that, they let you, uh, they do, yeah. How about side projects? Uh, yeah, that's on the side, on the weekends. So, uh, in, in true tinkerers fashion, I love tinkering. And so, uh, so yeah, been, been a manager for 3 years, uh, held different hats, product manager, engineering manager, engineer, right? Uh, and then since this thing called ChatGPT came out, you know, all of us have been captivated with what's going on. But I noticed, long before ChatGPT, you were at Carnegie Mellon, you've done some robotic stuff. Can you tell us a little bit about that?\n\nI'll rewind even before that. So back in undergrad, I, I had a fascination for space robotics. And so I participated in competitions like, uh, the University Rover Challenge, which is a robotics Martian Rover that you develop, and then CanSat, which is a rocket, uh, descent mechanism. So I was convinced I'm going to go into space exploration. But, uh, I came to CMU and I wanted to do research in, uh, lithium batteries or, uh, space robotics. And you know, I, I happen to take these courses of computer vision and machine learning and really dive very deep into robotics. And, uh, and end of first semester, I think I applied for another Masters in, uh, computer School of Computer Science. Um, yeah, and, uh, that was a really, really fun time, learned a lot.\n\nSo you got some background doing a lot of engineering and and ML work actually before the ChatGPT. And then you said, \"I'm jumping right in.\" Do you do that kind of work there at Amazon as well?\n\nNot exactly, no. I work on databases. So, uh, really, uh, middleware for databases, you can think of it, a gateway to databases.\n\nCool. So today we're going to talk a little bit about, uh, human-loop agents. We'll talk about your project. We'll dive right in. Um, and we'll explore kind of what's interesting in there. Hopefully, we'll see some of the code. And I want to, I really want to get at the learnings that happened during the two-day hackathon, um, that were discoveries, because we were all trying to kind of push the limits, right? But first, like, how do you define agents?\n\nYeah, I think agents are agents are a system, and this system is a state machine, and this state machine is composed almost of a, it's a graph, right? And now you're moving across this graph, right? So you have these nodes and you have edges, computer science 101. And, and really the state is captured, right? And LLMs are central to this, because now instead of being very deterministic about what should be called and what not, you have that still, but now there's a level of these LLMs deciding what should be called and what shouldn't be. Mhm. So that is an agent in my definition. And you know, agents are constantly evolving as we're seeing what does it mean to be human in the loop. So in your definition, what is the loop and why is there human? I guess if we draw parallels to, you know, self-driving cars, the way self-driving cars came about was, we didn't have way more in the streets of SF from the get-go. We had a human who was actually sitting behind that wheel and who was, you know, jumping in when the car made a wrong decision, right? Or when they determined it. Talking about in the early days of developing Waymo, yes, or or any self-driving car, yeah. Um, okay. And so I draw that P because that's exactly where we are right now with agentic related workflows. Okay. So the human in the loop on test full self-driving is when it tells me, \"Prove that you're awake,\" or \"You have to intervene.\" Yeah, that's a parallel to it. Okay. And, and so humans really, uh, these systems are not 100% accurate, they're not 100% deterministic as well, of course, so which is why we, we still need humans. Okay. So they're involved in the decision-making process. A human-in-the-loop agent system is a system where you've explicitly modeled the conditions at which you're going to bring the human into it. Is that the right way to think of it?\n\nPretty much. You decide what, so different from chat-based systems or co-pilot-based systems. So I think co-pilots by definition are, um, you know, they're there with you along the way all the time, right? You are in the driver's seat with co-pilots, versus with human in the loop, you aren't in the driver's seat for the most part, it's the agents, but you have configured them to involve you whenever, you know, an action needs a human input. Is it just a point on where you are on the spectrum? Is it a fuzzy, uh, spectrum, or is there, is there a hard divide?\n\nYou know, if I, if I'm in a Tesla, well, and it's telling me and I have to intervene, I guess that truly is autonomy and then I'm taking over, right? If I'm in a Waymo and it gets stuck, then I'm going to press a button and call support, right? It's how, I guess that's, those are both human-in-the-loop agentic systems, technically, yes. But a co-pilot system is just, it does one quick step and then it's waiting for me almost on every iteration. Yeah. So is it the time that's taken, how much time is autonomous, and therefore it's really just a spectrum or?\n\nI think it's a spectrum. I think, you know, you have agents which are maybe doing 60 or 80% of the work and involving humans for the rest, versus co-pilots which are very much like 80 or 90% human driven. Let's jump into your your demo. What did you do? What, what did you build in the week? Can kind of give me the elevator picture, show me the demo?\n\nYeah, so, uh, let me, let me talk about why we built what we built, and then I'll show the demo. So if you, if you see right here, can you, can you turn and and hold it towards the camera a little bit? Yeah, there you go. Okay, that's a CGM, a little, a CGM. What is CGM stand for?\n\nSo CGM is a continuous glucose monitor. Okay. And so, um, it's, there's a, there's a sensor which is kind of within my interstitial fluid, and it's giving constant readings every 15 minutes.\n\nRight. Tell me how many people are affected by the condition that would say that a doctor would say you should, you should have that, right?\n\nSo I'm pre-diabetic, and that's how I start wearing this, just covered in my annual physical, but one in three, more than one in three Americans, one in three people, which is a lot, right? They are pre-diabetic, extremely common thing. Okay.\n\nSo you're starting with that kind of problem domain. What, what, what is it that you built?\n\nImagine an agent, right? Almost a companion, right? Which could give you insights based on this data, and it's not just this data, but it's also all of your health data, right? Your sleep, your exercise, you could go onto other biomarkers, but let's just, just a health monitor with a new signal, this set, this set of data in that world, versus the Aura ring or your Apple watch or something. Okay. And how, how is that what you built for the hackathon? What made it kind of human in the loop?\n\nUh, those aren't, because you can't, there isn't one system where you can go ask questions, right? And get answers. So that's what we built. We built a system that has all of your data, and now it's smart enough to figure out, okay, you know, I ate, uh, kinoa salad yesterday, and for the past 5 days, and now you know that really helps my blood sugar, so maybe I must eat that, right?\n\nYeah. Would it notice a spike and potentially ask you, \"Hey, what did you eat,\" if you forgot to log it or something?\n\nYes, yes. Okay. So it's really looking at the data and working with you proactively, exactly. And, and, and the point is to drive behavioral change, and by having this proactively ask you that fun way to do it. Okay, because this is tinkerers, let's, let's, let's show the demo and then let's show the code. Let's, let's see what you build. I'm just really curious now.\n\nSounds good. So here is the, the dashboard that you can see. And so this is live data. So, uh, uh, this is Sean's data, who's been working with me on this. So Sean is also type 1 diabetic, and so we're really passionate about it. But this is real-time data. It's, it has a lag of about 15 minutes from a CGM. Yeah. But this is like, this is real time, real time. So you can see right here, this is, you know, 16:13, and it's 16:27 right now, right? So you have a time graph up and down as the glucose levels, and this is one day worth, not even just a few hours worth of data, this is 24 hours worth of data, right? And, and then you've got markers there for like food and activities, I guess.\n\nYes. And so you have your food, you have, you know, insulin shots when, uh, Sean is taking insulin shots here, uh, what was the last exercise you did, or how much was your sleep, right? All of those things right here. I'm curious, like, let's look at at that spike that was like around 3:18, is that one?\n\nYeah, that hump there.\n\nWhat was that? First, there was a food eaten at the low point. Yep. What was eaten there?\n\nSo right here, you can see pizza, pizza, which isn't surprising, right? Spiked up your sugar. If you've been diagnosed pre-diabetic, the doctor will kind of tell you generally what foods to avoid, right?\n\nThey do, yes. And carbs like, and pizza has sugar in the dough and flour is bad, it spikes you in general, yes. But it varies based on the, it varies, right? Everyone has a different genetic sequence, and a lot of people are predisposed to certain things, like I could be gluten intolerant, right? And that went from 100 to 170, or actually no, from like 20 or something to, so that went from, yeah, that was at 78, 81, and it up until 196.6. Okay. How significant is that range and how, how would that, for example, for that same food, how much might that vary from one person to the next?\n\nSo it really depends. For some people, uh, it might be just, it might peek at 140, which is the, uh, for folks who are not pre-diabetic or diabetic, that's the usual range that they're in.\n\nIs there a number of which the doctor's going to say, \"You're, you're good under there, but over that, you're kind of like taxing your organs or something?\"\n\nIt's called the A1C level, and so the A1C is an average of the blood glucose over the last 3 months, got it. That's what they check in the annual physical, yeah. So when you go like once a year and they do a blood draw, you're only getting a 3-month snapshot, and it, and it's not even going to see what pizza did to you today. And that's the whole idea of the continuous monitor. And I've heard people say like, you know, who've done this, that they figured out like, \"I can eat ice cream, I'm fine, but there's pizza, I can't eat,\" vice versa, that the variance is quite large, which is interesting. So you guys in a weekend did, uh, somehow got a hold of the data feed, you built, you know, on the, on the back end, we have our own CGMs, right? They pushing data, right? So we have a Lambda that's ingesting and then pushing it onto the back end, and then we're displaying it here. And then we're aggregating all of these events.\n\nWhat the back end you used, what for that?\n\nUh, we used Python for everything. Okay. And what for the data store? Just F or something?\n\nUh, we use Neon. Oh, you did, you're one of the sponsors, yeah. One of the sponsors, yeah. Um, so we used Neon, and, uh, you know, all of this data. Have you used Neon before or?\n\nUh, I had in, uh, while tinkering. It basically, for those who don't know, it's basically a, within 5 minutes, you could sign up and provision a database in the cloud, Postgres compatible, but also get auto-scaling and stuff like that. So you got, you had a back end with Python, you got a, a Neon-powered PostGres database, yeah. So the front end is all React. Okay. And what about for the LLMs and agentic workflows? How did you decide that? Obviously, uh, going back to our definition of what an agent is, like, we wanted to define this graph workflow, right? Have these nodes and edges, conditional edges on which once you receive an input, right? If I ask, uh, which I'm going to show right here, right? So if I ask this, \"Hey, based on the data from, let's just say, yesterday, what do I eat today for lunch, right? Such that my sugar does not spike?\" So what this is doing is, and I'll, I'll show the output in a bit, but what's this doing is, it's, uh, calling this agentic workflow, and, and you can see right here, we've defined this query Health Data, right? So this is one of the, one of the tools that we have, right? So initially, it goes to the LLM, it determines that, okay, the human is asking me about, uh, past data, so it figures out, okay, I must call this, uh, query Health Data, and then it's querying that data, and then you have other data there as well. So you also have, as you see here, your biomarker data, so this is real genetic test result data, not the genomic sequence, we're not going to expose that, obviously, obviously, but this is sort of the summary from it, got it. And based on sort of Sean's profile, it's taking the genetic, um, predisposition that he has and what he ate, and then you can see this is, oops, this is going over all of his glucose levels, right? All of the events, yeah, D, and it's finally able to summarize what you should be. How did it decide to do the Health Data query? Was there other tools you built that it could have invoked into instead of that one?\n\nYes, okay. So we have multiple tools. Um, so for example, this is the first thing, but imagine, right, after this, you're like, \"Hey, you know, I want to go and, uh, order something,\" right? And that's the second thing where I feel like these agents are really going to help, which is we have integrations with Instacart and all of these food delivery services. And so it knows when you ask it, \"Hey, I want to, uh, get me this meal, right, for the next one week.\"\n\nIs the agentic part the idea like, did you build another another kind of autonomous thing that's running in the ambient, you know, kind of like while you're not here on the website, and it's going to reach out and maybe order something from Instacart, or like, tell me more about the agent aspect of this?\n\nYeah, so the idea is that as soon as it detects, right, that proactively, \"Hey, like, over the last one week, uh, because of certain things, the sugar's been high,\" right? The next time, say you have a workflow that has a weekly meal or drink, the next time that gets triggered, it will call the agent, the agent will know not to order the same pizza crust for you and replace that with something else.\n\nYou talk about the once-a-year A1C test that gives you a rough 3-month average. M. So that's not going to tell you of pizza or ice cream at all, yeah. And then the doctor, think about the the agent in that system is the doctor probably review,\n\n\nYour file, 10 minutes before you walk into the office, and based on last year's data, the conversation you have, which lasts six minutes, and you'll get some course grain recommendations versus this. This is exciting, right? Yeah, that's exactly what happened to me. So last year, my A1C was, uh, 5.7, which is right about at the normal range, and this year it was 5.9. And so I was like, \"Wait, I have no idea what made this go up,\" right? 5.7, 5.9. Why should people care? Yeah, so for one, uh, anything above, I think it's 6.4 is Diabetic Type 2 diabetes. Um, and, and even being in the pre-diabetic range for a long time, so having a high blood sugar can cause your organs are basically working overtime, right? I read about some of that stuff: the limb amputations, kidney failure, stroke, blindness. You're at an increased risk of heart disease and stroke if you have these elevated levels, period. So extremely common, nobody's getting kind of real-time management of it. The dire consequences potentially. And then what were the existing solutions like? So this thing is vended by Dexcom, and Dexcom manufactures these uh, great devices, uh, but uh, I found that the app didn't have that layer of um, insights, real-time insights that I wanted, right? So we started building this for that, uh, and none of the other apps right now have those real-time insights. Mhm. This was an #anthropic hack. I'm assuming you used Claude? Yes, I did. I switched the #anthropic models between Haiku and Sonnet, and there was a a big difference there. Yes, there was a big difference there. You like what? So for example, uh, its pattern recognition was way off, right, for Haiku. Uh, we had to go and add additional prompts to go tell it that, \"Hey, if this happened,\" uh, right? Like it was paying too much weight on certain things that were too old versus something that was too new. Did you use any agent frameworks to help with with execution? Yeah, so we used LangChain, okay, uh, and LangGraph, okay. Yeah. And so can you show the code that? Yeah, oh, there we go. So, uh, so this is the, so you can see this is a Flask API just running, okay? So this is the the main agent file, right? Agent.py, and we were trying prompt caching here, but uh, really don't need it right now. So, um, you have effectively a few, um, as I said before, you have these nodes, and you have your conditional edges, right? And so, \"Ask human,\" right? Um, these are the tools. Uh, so you have \"Query Health Data,\" you have \"Get the latest genetic test data,\" and then you, you can make an order from Instacart or Uber, um, stuff like that, and you can add an event, right? So, \"Ask human,\" it, so the flow is this, right? You go type something, um, it goes to the LLM first, right? The agent goes to uh, \"Call Model,\" that's the first one, right? And then \"Call Model\" uh, determines, \"Okay, what is the question and what must I do?\" And then based on that, the agent decides, \"Okay, uh, I need to make a tool call to to this,\" right? To query Health Data, which is what we saw in the chat, right? And then it goes, makes that tool call, and then it comes back, and it says, \"Okay, is that done?\" So this is the \"Should continue? Should I continue with this or does that answer the question, right? Or do I need human input,\" which is \"Ask human,\" and that's the the human, and that's the human in the loop. How would it decide that? So for example, um, we have, we, the one-shot query from the LM is actually going to decide if it needs a human in this case. Yes, okay, correct, okay. And and can you show the prompts? I don't, I'd love to see what exactly the criteria was for that. So your job is to find relevant data, da da da, pick uh, appropriate action items from that. If a user asks what they should eat, you should observe trends from the past and the glucose levels to suggest similar food items. And right, we are saying, \"Fetch data from the past two weeks, and today's data is okay.\" And where was the part where it says \"Ask a human?\" So that is uh, this one right here. So for example, if I say, \"Make an InstaCart order,\" right? Uh, we actually ribbed out this workflow, but um, in the hackathon, you had this um, sort of prompt which said, \"Hey, if it is a uh, order, right, then you must go ask the human,\" right? Or if uh, it's not clear what the past data is, then you must go ask the human to input that event data, right? For the food ordering scenarios there, you had a more, 'cause it's not just data analysis, you assumed, \"Hey, we got that if we have the data, right? Or we can't, the human's not going to help.\" But but for the food order, we actually want to be careful because we're spending money and stuff, correct? And so, which is why we used, and I'm trying to find the file, uh, so right here, for example, um, right, this is an example tool calling agent, and so we're using human layer here, okay? Also, one of the sponsors. So, oh yeah, so human layer has this uh, think of it as a um, hook, uh, and every time you need to invoke the human, human layer can uh, help you with that. So what we did was, m, so right here, you see this, yep, and so this is all of the, oh, so they're just going to provide an API that says, \"Hey, allow me to ask humans,\" and then they're like, \"Cool, I'll help you configure Slack or wherever your humans are, your support tool workflow, etc.\" Yeah, that's nice. That's, that makes it, that's convenient. Okay, so you actually hooked up Slack and your team was the humans some of the time, right? And the different kinds of humans, right? In this case, like if this was a real product or something, you have the human, you know, patient, you might have like escalation to their doctor, you have the the nutritionist maybe that they've consulted with, or or, you know, you got the Uber Eats people, clearly, right? They could all be interacting with the system. They don't understand your system or how it was built, right? But they can be lassoed in, if that makes sense. Yes, that's so right now, we kind of um, raw dogging the prompts, which is saying, \"Hey, if it's this, then go ask a human.\" Um, but, and so we built this just for that Instacart use case, right? When you make an order on your meal that based on your previous data. But funny enough, I was actually on a Zoom call yesterday with uh, Dex, who's the founder of human layer. And so my ask for him was to add Twilio integration, because a lot of people, obviously, no one's going to go on Slack, uh, you're going probably going to use a text message, and this works both ways. So the idea is that human in the loop is you when you're making an order, right? And human in the loop is also your nutritionist, right? Because the next time that it's suggesting something that you know, we determine is is not safe, we can involve the nutritionist via text message. Yeah, and so that is the, I guess, the other order, which is how do you build, and this is something I've been thinking about, which is how do you build the right guardrails here? I mean, if the alternative is, \"Hey, I'm on the edge of diabetes, but the system gives me once a year, corar grain, and then I'm kind of on my own anyways.\" If I can get this virtual agent team that's like looking after me in real time every day and doing reach outs and in certain cases, \"Hey, loop in the doctor, I log into my chart, send a message if it's important enough.\" Did you think much about those different rules and how they would interact in terms of the human loop? I mentioned doctor, nutritionist, end user. It sounds like you did if you're asking him about Twilio. Yeah, so uh, from the LangGraph perspective, those are just, you know, uh, different nodes that they must be, you know, you can configure them as tools, right, in the tool definition or as another node, and the agent can determine when to go call them, right? But the question is like, how do you know, how do you tell the agent, \"When should you invoke the nutritionist or when should you invoke the clinician?\" Right? So like, taking a step back, like what these models are outputting right now, they, it's not deterministic, right? So I could easily trick it to tell me to um, you know, give a recommendation to actually consume 100 grams of candy. You could be a kid whose parents have told them, \"Use this,\" right? And hack it to get Uber to deliver candy. I guess you're saying the simplest way is like if you had uh, if you had data that was bad, where you know, you could, because you are the one who in a lot of cases can change the data, right? If I had consistent data that said candy, candy, and the blood sugar was like low, then it's going to realize that, \"Okay, like candy is not spiking your blood sugar,\" right? So you can't, yeah, that's interesting. In this particular domain, you can't just kind of specify a guardrail based on a food type, you have to specify in this abstract way based on the data, right? And a correlation that you don't have yet, you have to learn with the the actual specific person, right? Have you had experience with agentic workflow systems other than LangGraph? I did play around with um, Bedrock agents, and I was kind of doing a CER look up on CrewAI, which is another company that does. Used what did you think of it? I think some of those simplify the experience a lot, um, and I think, you know, there's no one size fits all. I think it's going to be dependent on what you're trying to do. Um, yeah, but if I said you had to build this whole thing and just write it yourself, how much more work would that have been? I think uh, just without any of these graphs, like it would have taken much longer for sure. So they have a way for you to kind of pop up a level and describe a higher level thing simply, and they're going to translate that into a lot of stuff that you'd have to do. Yeah, but again, like if you need very nuanced controls and right, like then you're better off uh, probably using this. So depends, yeah, probably using LangGraph. Oh, really? If you need the more nuance, yeah, that's what I observed. I mean, versus doing it yourself or versus another frame that you, versus any other framework, right? Because um, some of these frameworks, I think they take a lot of these abstractions away, they make it easy for you, but um, oh, you lose control. Yeah, so with LangGraph, you're not losing control, that's my experience so far, but I haven't, I need to go deeper on some of these other ones. Yeah, okay, that's really cool. What were the biggest challenges, I guess, that you ran? Was there anything during the weekend where you were hitting your head against the wall trying to get anything to work or figure out how to get the thing to behave? Uh, a lot of us were playing around with uh, LangGraph, especially, right? Like for the second or third time, mhm, and so just understanding uh, there is a lot of ramp up needed to understand exactly what to use and how to use it. Okay, so just getting that to work, I think took the longest time. How much of your code at the hackathon was written by hand and how much was written by Claude? Well, I don't know. Uh, we had a team of six, so uh, the code I wrote was about 60 to 80%, uh, LLM generator. Yeah, is is it a matter of convenience that you're outsourcing it or speed? Are you going faster now? I for sure, I'm going faster, yes. I was a coder before, um, but I don't have to think about all of these structural things, right? Like I, I think about the system design, and then I go and think about, \"Okay, what, what should be the functions?\" And then I just go and get the LLM to give me the skeleton of it, yeah, or pretty much like 80% of it. For stuff that's like in my single browser view, then it's excellent, but for things beyond that, I find uh, I have to throw out lots and lots of code because it just didn't even follow instructions. But with 01 preview, I've been having a pretty decent experience there. That, yeah, so you know, as of this morning, I mean, we were uh, we've been building on this, right? And so for example, I'll show you, uh, right here, you can go and right, you can go and add this event right here, okay? And so that whole UI was stoop the nuts. Yeah, I want to drill into that, because what I was saying is, you know, I might provide three or four view classes and three or four model things and definition from schemas and backend code logic, like that's existing in my codebase, and say, \"Build this new feature that uses that stuff in that way.\" Yeah, getting the answer, but not following directions or developing a bunch of code that I already had that I pointed it at that already existed, a new version of it that I don't want in my codebase for obvious reasons. Do you have the experience with 01 that's analogous there that says that's not an issue? Yes, so as of last night, actually, I was adding uh, so this genetic thing that I showed you, that table didn't exist before, right? And all of that was me asking 01 uh, preview to, \"Hey, go in, uh, this is what I want, m, give me all the SQL statements. I'm going to be using this database. I want you to give me all of it with the code,\" and it was able to do it. Cool, yeah. What's your IDE of choice? So right now, I'm using Cursor, but I'm a new Cursor user. I've only been using it since the hackathon. I love the, so the, if I'm working on a big piece of code, I might select a bit of it and then hop over and chat just about that. \"I want you to refactor this or whatever.\" I love that it can do that and bring it back in. Yeah, that's convenient. One thing for me is also the cost, and I think there is a case here that I haven't looked into how Cursor is sort of indexing your entire codebase, yeah, because I think that for sure is going to take up a lot of input tokens. But I do use 01 still for very specific uh, you know, debugging, for example, right? I just copy and paste, copy and paste over to a different session, right? Yeah, I wanted to go over, look at the browser preview of the UI I'm working on and just automatically know, yeah, what I'm talking about. Um, there, uh, it would do a better job, and I think obviously that's coming. And I want to be able to talk to it, too. We moved over to Next from uh, vanilla React, and uh, you know, we've been using VZ, which is great for that. Cursor for the IDE along with 01, so it's just so many bits and pieces there. Interesting. The the other thing is also voice, um, I've been thinking about voice, because obviously something like this, right? It just, if you have a proactive agent, then you almost want someone who prods you, like, right? Like, \"You ate a meal, go take a walk,\" right? So I'm not sure what the best modality is for that kind of health companion for yourself, but um, the Voice model that uh, sure, OpenAI just dropped, that's going to be pretty interesting, too. Yeah, um, cool. Are you going to continue this project? Is a team still working it? It sounds like you did some work on it this weekend. Yes, so we still are, uh, and obviously me and Sean are uh, our own, you know, first users, so we are the better users, and um, a lot of stuff you see here, right? Like, um, well, all of this, the data right here, we're actively monitoring it. Next, what we're building is, so if you see this, right, um, you can add event, you can delete event, this is all like basic, but what you can also do is based on, say, like handful of walnuts, I want to eat that right now, right? I can actually click on \"Predict,\" mhm, oh, cool, and it will, so this is going to the LLM, and the LLM is again making that \"Query Health Data\" call and figuring out, \"Okay, like what's happened in the past, how will that affect your\n\n\nBlood sugar right now, and so it says it will most likely result in a slight increase because it's seen this in the past, right?\nAnd it's giving you that reasoning, which is, I think, for something like, uh, Healthcare application, really important to give that reasoning, sure.\nUm, versus just being prescriptive.\nUm, very cool.\nUm, well, there's one more thing I didn't talk about.\nUh, so I talked about this, uh, so this is just a vanilla sort of explore dashboard, which helps you kind of drill down, but the idea is that you'd be able to go chat with the agent on, hey, like, why did this happen, right?\nWhy did that happen?\nAnd then this all ties up into your daily workflow.\nSo, uh, I didn't talk about Vision, but you can.\nSo, you really can upload a photo here, and we had this for the hackathon, right?\nAnd then you say analyze, and then it's just calling the um, Anthropic Vision model, and then it's spitting out these numbers, cool.\nUm, I haven't done any benchmarking to see how good that is.\nHow would you productize, productionize a system like this feature?\nDo you set up, do you do eval driven, you know, architect?\nI, not in the hackathon, but, but how would you approach it?\nWe ask it questions, and then we seeing what it does, like the HIU example I mentioned, where it hallucinated.\nWe then went and added some stuff to make sure it doesn't do that, right?\nSo you raw dog the queries, kind of do that with the result, but then go and add something somewhere, right?\nWhat is that system?\nWhat are you using for that?\nOh, just add prompts.\nYou just adding prompts in a test harness that you wrote?\nYeah, so you add prompts.\nSo, for example, it hallucinated in this pattern, and so you go tell it that, hey, when you see this, you do, you must not pay more attention to, right?\nYou can't just add that into your prompt without wondering, did it affect some of my previous results somehow, because of, you know, it's the Pink Elephant effect, where it sort of, you know, it may change your other results.\nSo, do you have a separate, like, a harness of evals that you'll run, you know, and, and then who looks in?\nHow do you evaluate those?\nWe don't right now, but that would be ideal to have that.\nUm, I don't know if there are Frameworks that allow you to do that right off the bat.\nJust how do I assess the quality of my, my prompt infrastructure, my quality of my, you know, the models may change or upgrade, and how do I regression test essentially against everything that I thought was working?\nYeah, I'm not sure.\nYeah, it's evolving.\nYeah, V0, like my, my main priority right now is to have those guard rails, because I can't believe in a hackathon project, you didn't have the guard rail set.\nCome on, I'm kidding.\nUm, but I mean, to the point of guard rails, I've been thinking about this, is it just, you don't, you kind of have to pick and choose, right?\nYou don't want a 01 being your guardrail for everything, but you maybe want a generic classifier on PII data, for example, right?\nAnd then how do you evolve that, like, for a use case like this, right?\nUm, that's very interesting.\nAnd the other thing is, right, with the human in the loop, at what point do you really escalate it to a clinician, for example?\nSo, I spoke to a clinician the other day, and their worry was, hey, like, you know, uh, CGM is not the only, right?\nThey prescribe medications like GP1 OIC.\nSo, if someone's losing weight really fast, right, and and some measurement drops, like, how I want to know about it, right?\nSo, you need, you need those escalation mechanisms based on the data.\nThis is a great example of like, not just a hackathon project that's innovative and creative and cool, but meaningful real world impact.\nSo, great job.\nYeah, thank you.\nIf anyone's going through this or interested in this, there's a lot of research going on in this.\nWhere can they follow the project or contact you, right?\nYeah, contact me if you're interested, or go to SmartNourish.co.\nUh, this domain may change, but it allows you to sort of sign up and join the weight list.\nUm, yeah, this is more than one in three Americans.\nSo, thank you, Varun, and also thank you for, I don't know if you've been a long time AI Tinkerers member in Seattle, and you started the Bangalore chapter.\nYeah, so that was awesome when you were there for a couple months and still going strong and amazing.\nSo, look forward to collaborating more on that front too.\nYeah, awesome.\nThanks a lot.\nOkay, thanks for having me.\nCool.\n[Music]\n",
