  "cleanText": "Basically, like my uh, batter is included.\nVery opinionated uh, starter kit that that is used for um, it's great for AI coding.\nCool.\nI, I went through every one of these tools.\nAI knows inside and out.\nIt's not like hallucinating.\nSo, this is something you could shove into like Cursor rules or something like that.\nYeah.\nHow is it changing the working relationship between the humans?\nI'm curious about that.\nAfter talking to Kevin, I was able to put some of his techniques to use, and I have to say I'm giving a lot more over to the AI now than I was a week ago.\nYou know, I've tried vibe coding, and things go off the rails.\nWhat Kevin has given me is a set of concrete tools and techniques that he's honed that just simply work.\nWe go through all of those in the video, but I want to tell you, like, he works at an incubator, Pioneer Square Labs.\nAnd while he's been there, they've spun out over 40 companies, and that means they've done a lot more than that in terms of prototyping because at an incubator, you're going to discard an order of magnitude more ideas as you go.\nSo they've really not just used GenAI in the products they're spinning out, but in the entire development workflow that they use to create the companies from BRD to PRD to code.\nNot just code, is he's really thought through the whole process of from ideation to writing code to using the latest models to do design iterations and architecture diagrams and to vet product requirement, the whole thing.\nWe go through all that in this video.\nIt was really useful.\nI hope you're going to love it, and I, I honestly think that he's doing it best in class, and you're going to learn a lot.\nSo, this is a great conversation, and we cover a lot more than that.\nI can't wait to share it with you.\n[Music]\nHello AI tinkers and welcome to Oneshot.\nThis is our global stage where we talk to people in the community who are doing interesting things somewhere on the forefront of generative AI.\nAnd today I'm thrilled to be here with Kevin Leneway, a multi-time presenter at AI Jinker meetups over the years, a longtime member as well, and someone from the startup community in Seattle that I've known for 15 plus years and who's worked, we've never worked directly together, but I've worked with many people that you've worked with.\nYeah.\nVery intimately.\nSo, it's a very cool to sit down and have this conversation with you.\nWelcome to the show, Kevin.\nThank you, and thanks for having me.\nI'm a huge fan of AI tinkerers.\nI mean, I, I, I love the sales startup community, but I felt like kind of got tired of events after a while.\nAnd then it wasn't until Tinkerers came along that I was like, \"Oh my gosh, an event that's like actually fun to go to, and the people are all amazing, and I'm learning stuff, like it just, it's so good.\"\nSo, I, that's great feedback.\nThat's great feedback.\nThank you.\nYeah, I stopped going to events long ago, and uh, if we're going to do an event, it should be one that we want to go to and get the value.\nSo, I'm glad that you enjoy that.\nUm, one of the things that's bubbled up through not just the community, but I think more from your YouTube videos, uh, has been this really interesting way of product development that you've discovered.\nI think you're very intuitive.\nYou're a tinkerer.\nYes.\nVery intuitive.\nYou're tinkering, you're playing, you're seeing what works, you're experimenting very rapidly.\nAnd uh, I want to have you show that off to people and and to me and to walk us through the thing.\nMaybe we could build something together.\nThat would be cool.\nBut maybe for people who don't know you, just a little bit about your background and what you've been doing.\nUm.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, so I work at Pioneer Square Labs.\nUh, so that's a startup studio here in Seattle.\nI've been there about seven years as a principal software engineer.\nAnd generally my job is like, I'm a kind of like a temporary early stage CTO.\nSo an entrepreneur comes in, we help to validate that idea.\nI'll generally build the first version, help to hire the technical team, and then move on.\nUm, and so love working there.\nIt's been super fun.\nAnd as part of that, you know, we've been really into AI.\nWe've been into AI for a while, but especially as LLMs have come about.\nNot only are we using it for some of our new startups, but we've been using it as part of our workflow.\nYou know, it's great new company.\nSo, it's, it's perfect for this prototyping, rapid prototyping.\nAnd the fact that we're doing it over and over again, so we can invest in some some tools and tips and and we're all sharing ideas.\nSo just to give people a sense of like, because I know how fast they iterate at Pioneer Square Labs.\nUm, how many companies have you actually spun out while you've been there for seven years?\nYeah.\nSo I think we've spun out close to 40 companies overall at PSL.\nI personally worked on about eight or nine.\nUm, and and how many ideas have you prototyped and because you discard a lot?\nYes.\nThat'll make it all the way through the validation, right?\nYeah.\nWe generally say about maybe nine out of every 10 ideas we toss, and so and oftentimes we try to validate ideas before we actually write any code.\nY um, and so by the time I come along and start writing code, usually the idea has been validated.\nThat being said, nowadays it's so much faster and easier to write code that recently, sure, it's almost like we've been building prototypes instead of instead of Figma, you know, what we used to do with design.\nIn a day or two, we could throw together something that's just like kind of working and good enough that it's like, let's start to test it, and it's a really useful part of that workflow actually.\nSo, yeah, that makes sense.\nI mean, it's been in the methodology for a long time to do the fake landing page test.\nExactly.\nNow you can do the fake entire working product test in a way, right?\nLike at least, I mean, it might not be scalable, may not have the bells and whistles, but it could do end to end.\nYou know, you know, we know any of these tools can do something pretty magical uh, in a very short period of time relative to just a year ago or two years ago.\nExactly.\nSo, it's exciting.\nSo, okay, you have this really interesting workflow.\nI think I don't know, you said something like Figma's dead or something, right?\nCan you just take us through that headline and then and then what is the workflow and Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, I think, you know, first of all, I think Figma is not dead.\nIt was a question, and the answer was no.\nThe answer was no.\nOkay.\nI think it's, but I do think there are um, a lot of techniques you can use.\nYou know, I've seen people use AI for coding quick prototypes.\nA lot of them kind of look the same.\nA lot of mine kind of look the same to be honest, and often that doesn't matter.\nBut there are workflows you can use for design.\nThere's workflows you can use for testing, debugging, uh, all sorts of different things.\nAnd you know, again, my day job requires me to just tinker around and find interesting ways that are repeatable.\nAnd so, between myself and some of my my colleagues, we've come up with a bunch of different techniques and and tips.\nAnd honestly, the other day it was, I was just sitting around and I was showing something in our team meeting.\nOne of my colleagues was like, \"Hey, how did you do that?\"\nAnd I just was like, \"I'll just make a video.\"\nSo, I made a video, put on YouTube because I, it was too big to send, and I shared it with them.\nAnd then I shared with a couple other people, and and next thing I knew, like, people were like, \"Oh, this is really interesting,\" and to me it's like, I do this every day, that interesting, but I was like, \"Oh, other people might, might find some of these other things.\"\nSo that's kind of started sharing stuff on YouTube, and and that's been really cool.\nThat's really cool.\nWe'll link to it in the description of the comments.\nUm, well, okay, so most people's, I think I would guess that most people got introduced, developers, I mean, right, they're coding, and they got introduced because they're at their IDE, and they put copilot in, and now we're doing basically fancy completions and maybe longer stuff, and then Cursor, you know, I think it took a while people to find, took a while for people to find the second tab that's more like agentic, you remember was defaulting to like the chat, and I was like, okay, a little bit of completion, chat, okay, what's the big deal, and then, you know, agentic, but what you're talking about, I think you're backing up out of the process a little bit.\nYou're talking about all the way from conception to like PRD to design to prototyping.\nIs that how you should think about what are those distinct components, like just to orient people where we're then going to dive in?\nYeah.\nSo the way that I like to do things is I will start off with, you know, and assuming this is a zero to one brand new product from scratch.\nOkay.\nUm, start off just spending a lot of time up front describing the thing I want to build.\nI'm gonna spend like an hour in notes, like just building out very detailed, exactly the, you're doing that on your own or you having a conversation with an AI?\nUm, it's usually on my own or even like, often what I've been doing is I'll sit down with someone from my team on the the product side.\nWe'll have a conversation, I'll record that, and then I'll summarize that.\nOkay.\nUm, and tweak from there.\nBut you know, it's really, I spend a ton of time up front just like really defining exactly the thing that I want to, and then you're getting what's the, what's the next stage?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo then from there, basically, I have a series of prompts that I've been perfecting and just kind of uh, you know, sharing with with the community.\nAnd um, basically the first one is going through and creating uh, a business requirement stock.\nNot that I need a business requirement stock, like nobody actually reads those things.\nBut what's nice about is if you use one of those the, you know, frontier thinking models.\nSo, I use 01 Pro, 03 Mini is good.\nAnd instead of just saying, \"Hey, give me a BRD,\" you actually say, \"Give me a BRD, but actually think through these like 10 random BRD frameworks or analysis things that, like, what are some examples like that?\"\nLike, I don't even, honestly, I don't even know what they are.\nThey are like, and I could share an example.\nWould they be things like, like what are the MOEs in this business idea or what?\nYeah.\nOr more like use the Jacobson uh, process to break down the the notes for this, you know, all these like very technical things that basically, and you have a library of those now that you actually use, okay, it's just like do four or five of, and the whole point of that is just do a bunch of thinking up front, get it to think as much as possible, and then output a BRD that you know tends to be higher quality than what he would get if you just said, \"Hey, I'm,\" so then I take that and no one reads that, but the AI reads that, yeah, nobody reads, I mean, I, I glance through it.\nI make sure it's like directionally correct.\nIt's always, I mean, the the new models are so good, you're going to guess something very solid.\nOkay.\nAnd it's very, very detailed.\nYep.\nAnd then I basically take those business requirements, do the exact same thing with the product requirement.\nOkay.\nAnd so from there, again, random buzzwords, it does a bunch of stuff.\nYou get a thing that's actually quite good.\nUm, and then from there, my next step, and this is sort of the key to making the whole thing work, okay, is I say, okay, take this PRD and have a very kind of a magic word, is make a markdown checklist of stories with one story point tasks.\nAnd basically what that does is it gives you, you know, basically a a rails for the AI to follow.\nOkay?\nSo you're able to do enough work that you're not constantly having to restart it, but it's not so much work that it just kind of goes off on its own and starts doing random these stories for the AI to work on.\nYou mean to actually start building code?\nStart building code.\nOkay.\nCan we see a PR in one of these checklists?\nOkay.\nAnd let's see.\nI can pull, I've got your screen on.\nGreat.\nLook at my chat GPT history.\nHopefully there's nothing too embarrassing in here.\nCrop that up.\nLet's see here.\nSo here's kind of my um, here's my prompts that I generally use.\nOkay.\nAnd so um, basically I said, \"Hey, let's start off, create an enhanced prompt for my pods and beardies,\" is how I did this.\nUh, and here's kind of an example of one like around Microsoft blue ocean, you know, Porter's five.\nWow.\nDo stuff like that.\nAnd so here's my, here's my uh, prompts that I use.\nSo you're a senior product manager and you pop, you know, put your specs here.\nI'm curious, just, just on the Porter five forces of these kind of big ideas, right?\nUh, have you gone from like, you know, product folks discussing something to this framework and significantly changed a product outcome or a company that you're spinning, you know, it's a good, so become more ambitious or some direction change.\nWe haven't done that explicitly for this, but one thing we have been experimenting with at PSL was kind of my over the break uh, project was an internal tool to start to use some rubrics and things like this to evaluate startup ideas and start to break them down.\nCool.\nAnd match, hey, here's an entrepreneur we want to work with.\nLet's suggest five ideas that might be really cool for not just like, hey, hey, I suggest an idea, but break it down into this like super longale thing.\nSo you're kind of building companies for the entrepreneurs that are part of that ecosystem.\nAnd it's, you know, it's not like they're going to take it off the shelf, just run with it.\nBut it's just starting.\nIt's a conversation to have with them and just kind of All right.\nSo you go from from that to and it looks the output is something like, like uh, or you have the checklist already.\nYep.\nUh, nope.\nSo this is basically just the prompt that I use, and then this gives you a BRD, and then Okay.\nHere's kind of the the PRD prompt.\nUm, do you have Github for these or this public?\nIs this something\n\n\nYes, I actually do.\nUm, if you go to, uh, let's see here.\nUh, here it is.\nSo, I've got this, uh, this is my NextAI Starter.\nSo, this is, this is, um, basically like my, uh, batter is included.\nVery opinionated, uh, starter kit that, that is used for, um, it's great for AI coding.\nCool.\nI, I went through every one of these tools.\nI know it's inside and out.\nIt's not like hallucinating.\nSo, this is something you could shove into like Cursor rules or something like that.\nYes.\nSome of these bits and pieces.\nYep.\nAnd even for this.\nSo, I have very, um, detailed Cursor rules that are already set up here.\nUm, and so, this goes through every single one of these tools and gives like, uh, pieces here.\nCool.\nAnd then the readme, I believe I have some of these prompts, uh, in the readme somewhere.\nOkay.\nUh, maybe not here.\nOh, here it is.\nUm, yeah, so I have my template.\nSo, this template basically, okay.\nUm, has some of those, uh, okay.\nYou know, things, and I saw some stuff in there.\nVersel and whatever.\nSo, we're going to get into like, we're going to go down this path.\nIt seems like we're going to instantiate apps.\nYeah.\nBy the end of it.\nOkay.\nSomething.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, so sorry I keep derailing.\nGot BRD, you got PRD, you got prompts that help you generate both of those, and then then what?\nSo, we go through that and then, um, yeah.\nAnd then at the very end, you know, basically create that checklist.\nSo, and show me what the checklist, uh, looks like.\nYeah.\nSo, let's see.\nUm, uh, can we have this?\nOh, here's my detail markdown checklist.\nUm, let me see if I have one.\nMy, uh, sorry, I don't have this here.\nUm, actually, let me show you.\nHere's an example checklist here.\nOkay, so it's, uh, let me actually get the code.\nCool.\nSo, basically, it looks something like this.\nSo, you'll have, you know, your starting point, initialize the project.\nOh, wow.\nHere's some routing.\nNow do the homepage.\nOkay, there's a greeting page.\nSo, so each, it's sort of building the app either page by page or or layer by layer somehow at a level that like basically a a competent developer would take it as an work assignment basically level.\nYeah, exactly.\nVery prescriptive.\nAnd I found that by saying one story point story, like it's kind of arbitrary, but that does seem to be something that kind of fits in that magic spot of like it's about 20 to 25 messages back and forth with Cursor, which is kind of where the limit where it'll stop.\nOkay.\nYou start to do like 50, it loses the context when it gets all funky and it's so generally I'll go through and, um, you know, one of these stories will be, you know, about 25 messages.\nYou wonder how much of the RLHF that's behind the scenes was sort of expecting that and that's why it works.\nYou know, it's like that's the normal unit of work.\nIt's, you know, you think about it was training on a ton of Github.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nGot a bunch of stories and things.\nDon't fight the nature.\nYeah.\nYep.\nYep.\nFor sure.\nOkay.\nYep.\nSo, this is kind of a right on.\nOkay.\nCool.\nAnd then so when you're when you're taking a story point and this this checklist or one one of these is a check, it's one item with some bullets, right?\nIs a story point.\nYeah.\nAnd and when you're feeding that, where are you feeding that?\nWhat's the next?\nIs that copy and paste into Cursor?\nYes.\nYep.\nSo pull up, I'll pull up Cursor.\nLet me show you.\nUm, I can just show an example.\nThis is something I've been working on today.\nUm, but I will pull up a little bit of my, uh, my history here.\nBut yeah, so, um, here is an example.\nSo I have this checklist that I created.\nSo, this is, um, this is a project I've been working on with my, my video series, which is kind of a a step-by-step kind of showing people how to create an AI coding agent.\nSo, like we're we're creating Cursor, right?\nIt's basically behind the scenes just showing people how to do tool calls, how to do some of this stuff.\nAnd so, as part of this, um, I created, uh, I have my docs folder here and here's my, um, checklist included post.\nCool.\nSo, interesting.\nYeah, the product I was going to ask like it seems natural that you would feed these to some kind of engine and that's what you're building in your videos here.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nAnd so and so this one's already been checked off, but basically, oh, and actually is editing the markdown to to pro make progress to track progress.\nOh, that's funny.\nSee if I can tell you what I've got.\nHilarious.\nLet me try to see if it'll kick this off.\nOh, funny.\nOkay.\nAnd so it basically just says is the engine this engine is open source as well.\nWe can we can, oh, the engine is.\nYep.\nIt's on my on my Github.\nOkay.\nUm, but yeah, basically, uh, it's very, very straightforward.\nYeah.\nGo through each story, find the next story to work on, review each unfinished task.\nMhm.\nAnd just go go do it.\nOh, sure.\nWhy not?\nBut if I wasn't using your engine, I could literally just copy the story.\nOh, yeah.\nIn this case, I'm building the engine, but I'm using cur, I use Cursor for this all the time.\nAnd I mean, Cursor is a fantastic tool.\nOkay.\nAnd so basically what it's doing is, are you all Claude 3.5 for everything?\nI've been using Claude 3.5 thinking.\nI go back and forth a little bit because it can get a little ambitious.\nUh, especially I actually find it works really well with this, um, kind of structured approach because it will follow step by step by step and then stop when you want it to.\nDo you find ambitious when you use it in that context?\nWell, I what I, you know, for example, I was working on something earlier today where, uh, I had a bug and I was trying to get a language server.\nSo basically, I could do some linting with my coding agent and if there's a linting error.\nYeah.\nAnd so had a language server built in there and it was pretty simple implementation and I had a little bug and I said, \"Hey, give me some ideas of like where I can fix this bug.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Well, I got some ideas actually.\nLet me just rewrite the whole thing.\nI can do something giant library.\"\nI'm like, \"Sure.\nCome on.\"\nYeah.\nYeah.\nLooking at I'm like maybe this is better.\nSometimes we appreciate that.\nSometimes that's magic.\nIt's just it was it was too much.\nThat's the kind of thing where like sometimes that's great, sometimes it's too much.\nUm, but I'll I'll tend to kind of go back to 3.5.\n3.5 is just such a soft interesting.\nWow.\nSo good.\nI would say 90% of the time right now I'm working off this checklist thing and then I'm just having it kind of go through and do things.\nIt's probably going to like it's trying to like rewrite code that it's already Okay.\nGoes already there.\nSo, but in your and in your in your methodology, you've gone PRD work items.\nNow you're coding.\nBut didn't we skip like the design?\nWe talked about Figma.\nLike what about prototyping a UI?\nY we're thinking that through.\nSo there's a couple things.\nSo one thing, so I haven't done it with this since it's a CLI tool.\nUm, but, uh, one thing that I like to do is use a tool called Storybook.\nSo Storybook, if you haven't heard of it, is, um, basically a front end.\nYeah, it's been around for a while in the source project.\nIt allows you to kind of view your components, React components individually and and it's used for visual testing.\nI tend to use it for, you know, this is sort of back in the days before you had the sort of hot reload built into your, uh, next or whatever it is.\nAnd instead of compiling something, it had a hot reload, one of the first ones.\nSo, you can just kind of see your components in real time.\nUm, it allows you to do kind of stories and kind of see how things might work.\nYou might have a a button that's disabled and then a small button and a big button and that sort of thing for your components or do they have a component library?\nFor your components.\nOkay.\nAnd so what's really nice about that is you can write a prompt that basically says build out Storybook stories for this product.\nSo we get all the way to the the purity part and we say instead of building the whole thing just build the front.\nYeah.\nAnd the the magic words I use there is use atomic design and which basically I honestly didn't know this but it basically means start with your basic components at a very low level and then start to put those together into, um, you know more complete sections and get all the way to a page.\nAnd so it kind of break it down into like about two or three levels.\nWow.\nUm, and that works really well because the AI can go through and start to build out these small components, start to build out all the things together.\nAnd what's really nice is you don't get tangled up in and where I've seen problems with AI coding is you build the front end, you build the API, you go get the database, and now you want to change things.\nOh, the API is going to be a little bit off.\nDo a migration for your base.\nAnd it's annoying.\nIt's like, sure, let's just start out with the front end, just get everything just the way you wanted.\nAnd I've actually found at PSL, um, oftentimes just having that where you can click through this prototype and and show people is good enough to get a sense of like, oh yeah, this is good or you know what, this is totally off base.\nLet's just let's let's toss it and start over.\nHonestly, it took I've had good luck with Claude 3.5 just having it go going from sort of PRD.\nYeah.\nWith no necessarily opinions on the UI.\nYeah.\nBut then saying, you know, I'll paste in BRD and PRD kind of level stuff.\nYeah.\nAnd then I'll say I need a UI for this and here are some preferences I have.\nYeah.\nAnd then like I really want to be focused on the next action or a central thing or or I want more of a dashboard style.\nI'll give it some guidance and then I'll use cloud artifacts.\nI'll just say drop mock it up.\nYes.\nAnd it'll do a good job and then I'll iterate with that.\nHow does that compare to using storyboard?\nThat level of design iteration.\nI guess I think it's very similar and I think you can kind of work, uh, they kind of work hand in hand.\nThe nice thing about Storybook is you kind of have the context because it creates these stories which are sort of these visual testing artifacts.\nUm, it gives the AI a lot of context about what that component is actually doing and things like that and it'll often give like mocking up data that goes into a into a component.\nSo that way the sort of know, oh, when I build out my API, it just has a lot of information about what that thing is supposed to do.\nSo when you go from PRD to Storybook components that are loaded in with state.\nYeah.\nAre you like copying and pasting in or how does that actual work?\nUh, that step work.\nUm, so basically I'll just copy paste in the the checklist of things to do and then it just it just builds that front end.\nStorybook will do that in its tool.\nOh, okay.\nYeah.\nSo the AI will build stories and then Storybook will just render everything.\nOh, can can you show us one?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo let me see if I can find.\nAll right.\nOkay.\nSo, it took me a sec, but so here's an example of Storybook.\nSo, this is a a project that I was working on, um, at PSL about two months ago.\nBasically needed a a fake, uh, privacy impact assessment form to test out this AI agent that that we were working on.\nOkay.\nAnd so, um, it's one of those where it was going to take two weeks to like get access to this, uh, tool that I needed.\nAnd instead, I was like, well, let me just make my own and do it in like an hour or two and and do that.\nAnd so the way that, um, I did this and this is all, um, using Storybook.\nSo your Storybook here is we kind of broke it down into, you know, these these smaller components, um, and so you know, and these are very small.\nSo this is like a little accordion kind of thing.\nUm, and and you have these stories that kind of have these different states.\nSo here it is when it's closed.\nHere it is when it's opened.\nYou know buttons.\nThis is kind of your standard thing that you'll see which is you know you got a next and back and disabled and secondary.\nUm, your drop downs of you know different things with when it's disabled or if you have different things selected.\nOkay, so you can just kind of test stuff out.\nUm, and these tend to be fairly small and then they start to build up a little bit bigger where it's like okay here's a panel where it's like a search box and some some of these the width is, um, you know you can kind of see that.\nBut how did you get to all these implemented to these records?\nYeah.\nSo the way I did this is I had my Cursor tasks here.\nMhm.\nAnd basically I gave it, um, let's see here.\nI think I have this [Music] here.\nOh, so this is my second.\nSo I I had already I had a previous one, um, where I was actually creating stories.\nAnd so basically, okay, um, I said use atomic design and based on all this information give me all the individual components and then give me the, um, you know sections and then give me the full pages.\nOkay.\nI just went through and I just check check check check check did all and then at that point you could look at it and say no it's too complex simplify it or combine some concepts or you could.\nYep.\nAnd then it's it's really nice because then I can at the at the end of it is basically put all these pieces together and show me what this looks like.\nAnd these are little React components is what they based in React.\nAnd then this is kind of my way to like, you know, I can click through the almost the entire app, right?\nUm, and I can show this to the stakeholders and say, \"Hey, what do you guys think?\"\nLike, you know, is this is this useful?\nShould I move things around?\nDo these also assemble the full pages somewhere in here?\nYes.\nYep.\nYep.\nYep.\nAnd so\n\n\nHere's the formatted text:\n\nHere's like my compliance page, the context page.\nAnd okay.\nUm, it's also nice because often with LLMs, you know, they will, even if you have components, try to rewrite stuff.\nYou end up with duplicated code all over the place.\nAnd by going through and just doing the Storybook thing, it's really good about reusing those components because it's all just kind of all right.\nI hope so.\nThat's really interesting.\nAnd then, um, yeah, and then the really nice thing is once you have, um, all these stories in place, you can then go through, basically, have all those stories and send that back to the LLM and say, okay, analyze this code and help me to understand what should my data model look like?\nInteresting.\nWhat should that, um, you know, the API layer look like?\nOkay.\nAnd then give me a checklist of those.\nAnd so that's basically this next step that I had in here.\nSo I replaced my front end into this, which is it went through and based on that story, it just gave me this data model, and just looking at it, it's like, oh, this is actually, this is good.\nThis isn't a super complex app, you know, it's a form filling out things.\nThis is actually a pretty good, um, thing for this.\nBut I found even for more complex stuff, it does a really good job.\nSo, basically, it's going to go through, here's all my models, and then it's going to start to go through and give my, you know, I use TRPC, which is kind of just using routers, um, and routes and API.\nYeah.\nAnd it just goes through and it just gives me my basic CRUD implementation, just sort of basics here.\nUm, and it's just tech check, and then by the hour or two, I can just have a fully working, you know, front end, back end, everything's just kind of it's super cool.\nDo you think there's going to be a world where we just live in the BRD, PRD, and we delegate everything here to some engine that then maybe Alice has to look at something else, like, uh, validations or or tests or or goals or or business outcomes, even something else, but it's something where the machine itself can say, you know, I'm going to go off and do this for you, and maybe it'll take till tomorrow morning, but I'll I'll have it, I'll have you covered.\nI do think so.\nI don't think I, I think there's going to be exceptions, right?\nI think, and I think, um, it's going to take a while.\nThis isn't going to be.\nYeah, engineers still have a lot to do.\nAnd I've actually found the more that I use AI and do stuff, there's just like 10 more things that everybody wants me to do.\nIt could end up there.\nBut I do think what's going to be really interesting is we're just going to keep going up layers of abstraction higher and higher and higher.\nAnd we're already seeing it here with using AI to to build a lot of these.\nBut what you're going to start to see is like almost like new languages that are going to be really clear building blocks of things that you can use to build, uh, yeah, almost like what I'm doing, and then there's going to be abstractions on top of that and on top of that.\nI think you're going to get to a point where you're just going to have, you know, really high agency product manager generalist types being able to build almost anything you want.\nUm, and again, that's not a next year prediction.\nThat's a five-year prediction.\nBut, you know, I think there are certain tasks where you're already seeing it.\nAnd I think that's kind of what I've been trying to push on here, just to show, look, if you light everything up perfectly, you have the right stack, you have the right job role, you have the right, uh, person who's curious and has been doing AI stuff for years in prompt engineering, actually, you can get really far right now.\nAnd this stuff is just going to keep getting better and better, and more people are going to be able to do this.\nSo yeah, I think it's it's like prefab housing.\nWe're going to build more houses, and they're going to be a little cheaper maybe, but there's still going to be problems with like, oh, this one's on the hill sloped like this, and we need to get out a saw and like do some, and if you don't have the context of knowing the overall architecture or what's possible with the materials or the tools, you're kind of stuck.\nYou can't just delegate it.\nYou're sort of that analogy.\nWhat are those areas where you you find using this workflow, you are still like up and rolling my sleeves and diving in?\nYeah, I got refactoring.\nRefactoring has been really hard, um, for for major, like, complicated refactors, right?\nSurprising, you know, I would have thought, yeah, I would be really good at that.\nWere refactors easier when you had handwritten the code because you knew the code that you were refactoring, and therefore you could sort of plan it out?\nAnd you find it, do you ever find, I find that that case where I'm refactoring code where I have a lot of code that I wrote myself in my repo.\nI have a lot of code that it wrote.\nYeah.\nAnd now when it's touching that code that I didn't write, that's where I'm, I'm like, it's showing me I'm going to do this.\nI'm like, for me to validate that's okay.\nYeah.\nI need to go spend a few hours to understand it.\nThat that's a major friction, right?\nAnd I find I I need to be, I I need to develop my own new disciplines as a developer, which are, you know, I had my own disciplines before, and now I've gotten, I've gotten lazy a lot of times where some of this stuff is just so good, and I just find myself like just vibe code in the way.\nCheck, check, check.\nWhat's the craziest production vibe code introduced error that you've you've introduced?\nWell, here's one most annoying.\nYeah, this is so embarrassing as it is.\nUh, but, uh, I don't know, this is necessarily a vibe code thing, um, as much as a actual Cursor bug that they fixed immediately, but the other day I was building my, um, my CLI tool, my AI coding tool, and as part of that, I was like, oh, I want to actually pack this up, put it on npm, people can install it on their command line, and so like, I haven't done that in years, and so I was like, okay, let me just ask, and I got some nice, perfect steps, like, here's exactly what you need to do, and very specifically, you need to create this npm ignore file to make sure your keys don't button.\nOkay, went through, I was like doing all this stuff, and it was like, all right, we're ready to deploy, you want to deploy it, and in my mind, I'm thinking I need to really, I should look through all this stuff, it really should, but it's getting late at night, and I was like, okay, fine, and I hit go.\nThe next thing I know, my email goes off with like 10 different alerts from like open anthropic AWS saying your keys have been exposed.\nI was, yeah, I was like, I'm such an idiot.\nAnd what had happened was, even though Cursor said it had created that npm ignore, there was a bug where actually, if you start a file with a dot, it wasn't actually applying those changes.\nOh, wow.\nAnd so when I actually opened up that file, even though it showed up there, it was blank, and that's what caused the whole thing.\nAnd honestly, even if I hadn't done that, it would have fallen back, like ignores the whole finish.\nIt was so dumb and felt like an idiot, and I spent a day undoing a bunch of.\nI happen to think that there's a genre of tooling that at least I haven't seen startups yet.\nMaybe there are some, there probably are, but yeah, that's in the realm of testing, like production testing, like canaries as a service and things that are needed because there's so much more code.\nIt's no one knows the code, and so you need these like other kind of agentic testing things that also don't know the code, but at least they know what broken and good looks like, and they're there to validate, I guess, maybe your PR, and they kind of run the doing their job.\nUh, yeah, I I think there's that's needed.\nIt's analogous to the alerts you got.\nThat was one such tool, right?\nActually, we need a lot more like that.\nYeah, thank goodness.\nDo you want to hear my most embarrassing vibe code bug of the last couple weeks?\nSo, uh, this is when I really started going vibe coding.\nI'm doing a lot of agent coding.\nI review everything.\nI like, you know what?\nI'm just I trust it.\nMy my trust has gone up.\nSo, throwing lots more changes in, refactors, ship it.\nAnd, um, I, uh, so I had this, the code was, um, so the bug was modals stopped working.\nOkay.\nSo, modal dialogue popup to gather info or are you sure or whatever.\nI use those, and they just stopped working.\nSo they would pop up, and then the entire screen would be half dimmed out, and nothing is clickable.\nBack button, nothing works.\nJust frozen.\nYeah.\nJust horrible.\nAnd even figuring out what happened was, was Cursor couldn't help me debug it.\nCursor comma where even approach was, it was something to do with z-order and conflicting JavaScript files.\nThe bug turned out to be, um, unrelated to the modals.\nSome other JavaScript that was handling like some, you know, one of these slick like loading interstitials that, you know, I have a little widget that like I can parameterize with like, um, you know, if it's the AI thinking, it's this thing and put words in there, and you know, sometimes it blurs the background, sometimes it doesn't, you know, just good user experience, you know, sometimes it's there, and it's integrated with this thing that's pulling for state and whatever, somehow that got in conflict with, uh, JavaScript and CSS, like unrelated to that somewhere else in a way that was like the changes that the AI had introduced over here as part of some other change that had nothing to do with that.\nYeah.\nMade this modals not work.\nThat's brutal.\nSo hard to test, right?\nWe're going to find.\nNo.\nNo.\nThat.\nYeah.\nPart of what made me think about this test coverage thing was like that's the kind of thing you wouldn't write a unit test for.\nRight.\nYeah.\nRight.\nUm, so and also it was a thing that was like not super obvious.\nIt was like very important if you're like on a setting screen and clicking edit and then on that one function it has a bottle.\nYeah.\nBut other than that, you're not going to see it every day, right?\nSo it's like until a user reports it, then you're you're just suffering.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIs bad.\nYeah.\nI feel like a lot there's going to be a lot more software like that that's like.\nYeah.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd I think that's where, you know, to my earlier part, like the the levels of this track, I think having, you know, more testable building blocks that you can kind of put together in more standardized ways is going to be more the way that people are going to vibe code in the future, and especially people who don't have an engineering background.\nUm, and I think if you were to set that up in the right way, you could actually get pretty far.\nYeah, you may not have the most unique looking software, but again, our software doesn't look that unique anyway.\nYeah, depending what you.\nI think if it can, if it can work, and and there's a lot of cases where just for business software and things like that, uh, just having it work and be good enough is is going to be really valuable.\nSo, yeah, it'll be interesting to see how that plays out.\nHave you, I mean, you talked a lot about building the the UI.\nWell, this whole process includes the UI, but it's very traditional UI.\nHave you explored different user interfaces for systems now that we have multimodal AI and voice can do a pretty good job and and you know what I mean, like, yeah, yeah, a little bit.\nSo, um, you know, one of the things I worked on all last year was my, um, coding agent called Jacob.\nAnd one of the things I wanted to do with it, which in hindsight, I probably should have just gone with the standard thing and go with a chat, but I was really trying to think through what are some different ways that you can interact with an AI that's not a chat.\nYeah.\nAnd and being able to, um, visualize things and kind of kick off agents and visualize how agents are working behind the scenes and and do all that stuff.\nSo, I've been doing some of that.\nU but you do kind of run into this problem where you know you're you're almost introducing too many new things to a user at once, like AI is already pretty unique for the majority of users.\nAnd so if you stray too far off something that they're familiar with, you know, the chat works really well, but I feel like you often hide a lot of the the the value that's there.\nAnd so trying to think through like how can you adjust, uh, you know, chat to make it more adaptive where I mean, you can expose the functions that are available and you can click on buttons, things like that.\nYeah.\nOr what I've been trying to do is is use another paradigm that the people are used to.\nSo like, you know, with Jacob, I was using, um, almost like a Kanban style, like, you know, showing to do and done, and then you can click in and kind of view kind of what's been done, and people are familiar with that, but a little bit different way of interacting with with an AI.\nUm, but yeah, those are kind of some of the some of the things I think about from a UI perspective, but yeah, it's it's it's an interesting thing.\nIt'll be interesting to see how that that works.\nI'm really excited about actually as a developer, and you've worked at Microsoft and big teams with huge organizations.\nWhat was the biggest organization you worked within?\nUh, I'm sure the developer platform evangelism group, which was probably, you know, many thousands of.\nOh, wow.\nOf people.\nBut, um, yeah, my team was, so everything you described with PRD, BRD, the design, these are all separate, like you may even may not even meet these people in the course of developing the software, and now you know, obviously at a studio, it's really fast, but it's gotten even faster with AI.\nYeah.\nWhat are the like, like at PSL, like how is it changing the working relationship between the humans?\nI'm curious about that.\nYeah.\nI mean, one thing is, and we're even seeing it with our small team is, uh, a mixing of, uh, you know, I've seen some product people that are are writing code, you know, we have a a new product, uh, person, and and basically they're doing this experiment to see, uh, can they write and build an entire startup in 30 days just by themselves, including writing the code, and it's somebody who, you know, like coded a little bit and has some background, but not a professional coder.\nYeah.\nAnd we're seeing how far they can get with that or one of our designers.\nYou're doing it as an experiment.\nYou say, \"Let's try it.\"\n\n\nYeah, let's try.\nI've been doing a lot more on the design side. Usually, we partner with the designer, and I've been doing a lot more of, you know, using things like, like, actually, I have it up on my screen, which is one of my favorite tricks, is using this approach of, like, uh, we're calling rubrics. And so, basically, what you do is, and you can do this with a lot of different things, but I've been doing this with design is, is basically saying, not just, \"Hey, make my design better,\" but saying, \"Hey, here's a rubric that explains what a good design looks like, and here's...\" It's kind of hard to see because it's markdown, but basically saying, you know, here are some categories to think of for design, and then here's what an A design looks like. Here's what a B looks like, all the way down to a, \"Here's what bad design looks like.\" And I basically say, especially with the thinking models, \"Yeah, look at this component and give me a really good design for this.\" Wow. It's hard until you can get an A. It does work. Surprisingly works. And it works for a lot of different things. This rubric approach we've been using a lot of PSL. It's kind of our secret sauce for some of our new things. But really, that's really cool. It's been a really good way to take a reasoning model that's, you know, really good at math and coding and get it to do things like, like design. I love it. I love how deep you are into this, into like a methodical approach to using the thinking models, right? Thinking models aren't that, they aren't that old, right? We haven't had a lot of time to play with them, and you're really pressing them to, to get repeatable utility out of them for different domains. That's really, that's impressive. I mean, I've done the, the spaghetti throw up against the wall version of this is, I'll take a page that I am not happy with how it looks, but I'm not a designer, right? And I'll just throw it in. I'll literally copy and paste the entire HAML, or if I'm in Ruby, or whatever, HTML, or the raw HTML output even, I'll just say, \"Hey, go redesign that, make it look awesome, make it look better, make it simpler.\" Does a decent, half decent job, actually, totally works. Do you feel like with the rubric and that it's, it's able to follow these nuances and actually focus on color palette or layout and grid and actually in a nuanced way affect...? I think so. If you took this, and if, if I took this right now to one of my pages and I said, \"Yeah, I want color and layout and fonts to be an A, but make layout an A.\" Would it actually do that? That's a good question. You know what I mean? Like...\nYeah, we've played with some of those of going back and forth of, like, saying, um, yeah, only focus on these categories and not these categories. Yeah. Yeah. It does. I, I feel like it will try to be, it tries to be the A across the board because it's trying to, like, please the... It's always right. Right. Right. But it, it does kind of, it does work, and this is something we've been, um, exploring, and I think, you know, I think more people could, could explore because that would be super useful. The selective attention to specifics while ignoring others would be really good in the sense of, like, software change management and and risk of new bugs. Right. Yeah. I, I do not want you to change the interaction model at all. I just want you to restyle things. Yes. Exactly. Right. I reskin, but please don't, you know... Yeah, like, make my modals not work anymore. Whatever. Exactly. Yeah. And, and to give you a specific example. So, this is a project I worked on was last week, I think. Yeah. Um, basically, it was just showing an example of how to, um, you know, build something from scratch, and and focus on, this was an electron app. Um, and I was building an app, uh, and basically, this is a tool called Pacemax. I got it open here. Um, it's basically a tool that I use.\nUm, it's, you know, there's a lot of different versions of this, but basically, you can go out and select a folder, and then you can just copy all of your files in there, so you can paste it into an LL. Okay. And this is your tool. This is my tool. Yeah. Cool. Open source. You can check it out. And I was building it, and it was, it looked terri... It looked awful. It was just junky. And... And what I said was, \"Okay, don't just focus on the design. Actually, focus on the UX first. Just do black and white. Yeah. No colors. And then follow this route.\" And so, um, you know, even though this has color right here, but basically, don't ignore the color, but just work on these things, the layout and the typography and the spacing. And it came out with this thing. And honestly, like, I looked at it, I'm like, \"It's actually quite good. This is 100% better than what it was before.\" Uh, but for a tool like this, this is actually a pretty nice, um, UX for this. And of course, you can add step and do more of a color, but honestly, I was like, you know, incredible. Do this like linear kind of, like, simple kind of thing. Um, but you know, it's got the, the right level of, um, interactions, the right level of things here, and you know, the call to action, like, it just felt good to me, and and to go from terrible to this, basically one-shotting using that rubric. Sure. It was like, \"Wow, this is actually really powerful.\" It's, it's a really kind of, kind of cool way to do that. So, um, huh, that's fascinating. Do you, do you, uh, you know, I've heard, and, and anecdotally, I've experienced that Claude 3.5 is better at visual design, you know, iterations, right? You've experienced that too.\nYeah, I'll go as far as to say every other model is terrible at it.\nIs really good. Starting with 3.5 is really good, and everybody else... Are you aware of anyone who's attempting to specifically focus on design iterations with generative AI for UI in the form of, like, either leaning into multimodal or have fine-tuned something, or...? That's a really good qu... I haven't, and it's surprising, and it's something that I would love to play with because so much of, you know, we do a lot of design work at PSL. I think this is a great startup idea in that space. Somebody's got to be working on that, and it's a perfect component of any of the coding tools to have that element. That's right. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen some interesting stuff around, um, around AI and and and design, but it's much more about, like, leveraging colors and kind of autogenerating things and being able to play with it. Yeah. From almost like a Figma, but for AI kind of thing, not from a model. Sure. We haven't talked about agents. So, are you, have you built any, like, the coding agents were sort of agents, I guess.\nYeah, that was definitely an agent. That was a very early agent, actually. Yeah. And it's interesting. So, I started with Jacob. This is probably a year and a half... Oh, yeah. And of course, back then, we didn't have the models. Motorport wasn't good enough to run a real agentic work. Yeah. And people were trying, and it was just kind of a mess. I kept... So, every, like, three months, I would, like, rewrite Jacob to be from kind of a step-by-step workflow type thing to a much more agentic tool use thing. Yeah. And I found that it was much worse, and then I ditch it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three months later, I tried again, and, like, a little bit better than that. Did it switch over at some point? Did I think it was Sonnet 3.5 was really kind of the tipping point, and and me personally, by then, I had been burned enough with it to say, \"Ah, Asians are overhyped. This isn't working. It's going to be a year or two before it's ready.\" Mhm. But no, 3.5 was there. And that's where I think Cursor really, if you look at their trajectory. Yeah, makes sense. Especially with the agent stuff that they got. Have you since built any agents for your own workflows or own productivity or just for fun? Yeah, so I've been working, actually, this past week, I've been working on, um, just a little CLI, uh, agent that's mostly just been a, um, educational project for me. So, this is my, uh, interesting, cool, my, what I'm calling forks, just, you know, every forks b code, um, but basically, you know, I basically set up a ripple, and it just calls these tools, and so, you know, I've just got a handful of different tools that do different things. First of all, you using frameworks, or you hand coding your...? I'm hand coding this. Yep. Um, and, you know, generally, I just, I haven't been using frameworks. Um, but, like, here's an example of my bash tool, right? And this is, like... Yeah. Cool. Pretty, pretty straightforward, but it's got some nice things, like, \"Hey, don't do all this stuff.\" It's got some login and things like that. Cool. Um, and then it just sends it all to the, um, to the AI. In this case, we're using, uh, uh, Sonnet 3.7. Okay. Um, where's your registry where you tell it that these tools exist? Uh, that is, it's in my system prompt, which... Oh, okay. Somewhere here. So, just somewhere you've said, \"Here are the tools and their interfaces.\" Um, so, basically, well, the system prompt kind of says, um, actually, this doesn't have the tools themselves. Um, it says to kind of use, use tools, but then the, the tools are basically generated, uh, what I say, it's here.\nUm, the tools kind of have a, uh, yeah, so we got permissions, but it's basically kind of building these up from some parameters. I forget exactly where it is.\nUm, maybe it's cool. Um, yeah, this is just the, the, um, but anyway, it's kind of got some, some basics around, um, you know, what... Oh, here it is. Sorry. So, at the top of each file. So, it says, you know, what the name is, very detailed description, and then just your, your schema for what's going in. Cool. What's required? Um, and then, yeah, what happens when you go and execute it. And you just keep doing this for every single one of these. Yeah. And what's really nice is, you know, for a coding tool, it's actually not that complicated. You know, you get 15, 20 tools in there. Sure. When you're coding agent, you're either writing a thing, editing a thing. Yeah. And then a bunch of stuff to kind of figure out context. Sure. And so, um, you know, it's kind of a nice learning exercise. That's part of the, the series I've been doing is, is more just kind of walking through how are tools made, what, what does the tool call look like? And basically, just trying to show, like, what this isn't that hard. Like, there's some patterns here. You don't... But at the end of the day, the AI is doing all the lifting. The model's doing the lifting. You're just provided. That's right. Have you, have you, uh, needed observability, like, when stuff goes wrong, you need to rerun a piece of it, and or understand what happened to get there? Yeah. Have you solved that on your own or using a tool, or you just...? I haven't. I haven't done a great job of that. You know, in this tool, um, I have a series of different logs, so I can basically see, you know, here's all my actions that were created and when it was done. You have a way to get at it at least. Yeah. Some, some basic analytics and then just tracking the conversation. So, this is, but this is just kind of my own local, sure, debugging kind of thing. Um, I, I personally, for, I've been using Portkey a little bit, which is a nice, um, service that allows you to kind of run different models, um, swap them in and out very easily, and then just get some tracing, uh, there. But, uh, this is an area where, you know, especially since a lot of the stuff I'm doing is so early stage, y, it's moving so quickly that generally, by the time you put in any kind of, like, you know, really detailed testing or or observability, um, things have changed, so that you got to just undo everything. So, we tend to just kind of get things as, as set as possible, and then when the CTO comes on board... Yeah. Once we kind of implement that tools that they prefer. So, I see, that makes total sense. Have you used something? What do you use? Do you have any preferences there? No, I'm winging it. Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. And I don't use frameworks either. I use frameworks. I use frameworks to learn. Yeah. I read the docs. I read the frameworks. I read the sample apps. Sometimes I run them. But I typically discover that unless I'm getting to some hard problem, like, \"Oh, yeah, I'm not going to implement my own database.\" Yeah. I'm not going to, you know, right? The choices are, like, not implement that, but whether I use, like, a PG vector or a dedicated thing. Choices like that. I spend a lot of time, and I test, and I talk to people, but those are the only times where it's where I'm ever thinking, \"Do I just use something that someone else has created?\" Otherwise, I'd create it myself. Same thing. Yeah. Semantic search is a big one for you, like, \"Do I, do I hand cut this?\" But I've actually found a lot of this stuff is, is when you start working on it, it's actually pretty straightforward compared to what I thought the beginning. So, part of it's, I do have a lot of code in production, uh, powering ters and stuff, and I get startups all the time, but I, I don't want to tool up into something, and honestly, like, they fail to raise money. I've got to rip it out, and then I'm, I don't want to have that weekend. Yep. Where I'm like, \"Sorry, honey, I've got to do this thing or the whole site goes down. Whatever.\" Exactly. The other reason is because, honestly, so many of these conversations, people are very complimentary. Yep. On camera and off camerara, they're like...\nActually, and I think that, I think the state of the community is people are sort of diying it at this point, except for when it comes to, like, I do see people adopting the observability platforms, obviously. Uh, some of the, the serverless stuff is really interesting if you look at lineon to scale your databases. Yeah, yeah, like, you know, I, I think there's just a cost trade-off. It's not a good, it's a good decision, it's you got to be aware of the cost. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Um, but I don't think it's a build versus buy decision, if you will. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Fun stuff. Um, what are some of the coolest, uh, interesting things you've, you've seen, uh, others...\n\n\nWhat do you do with agents, you know, in the community?\nYeah.\nLet me think.\nOr others in the office, you know?\nYeah.\nI mean, my favorite thing right now is, you know, agent-wise, is honestly deep research.\nThat's been the one tool that I found is like...\nDid you go to the last AI tinkerers?\nI didn't.\nI missed my Bal had the open, uh, open.\nYeah.\nYeah, I know.\nBal.\nYeah, I saw, I saw the what he did.\nYeah, I, I just...\nWell, I love the fact that like something really profound could come out.\nThere'll be an open source version in two days, right?\nAnd it might not be as good, but it's open.\nWe can, we can build upon it.\nAnd I love it when it's somebody I know from the community sitting, you know, at our meetup the next day.\nYeah, I've starred like a handful of open manis.\nDifferent things and and looking the deep research really all of them now on all of the platforms.\nI use them all.\nWhat I'll do sometimes is like kick off three at once.\nI'll do like a Grock, OpenAI, and Gemini.\nYeah.\nJust cuz why not?\nYeah, exactly.\nIf I'm going to have to wait seven minutes, I might as well see three, you know?\nYeah.\nI haven't...\nHave you developed an intuition for like, you know, you going through these workflows and being methodical as you are?\nHave you developed an intuition for like which of those tools is better for which kind of or even just reasoning models?\nI'm still curious for reasoning problems.\nWhat types of reasoning problems are better on, you know, like a Gemini thinking versus a 3.5 thinking or...\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI, you know, from my experience and and some of it is just based on inertia and when I've been using and I when I find that it works really well, I tend to use it.\nSo, you like, I haven't, I haven't even tried out Grock more than just like a couple, a handful of queries.\nUm, but I find that, uh, 01 Pro, even though it's expensive, has been pretty far and away my favorite reasoning model.\nYep.\nUm, and even better using deep research, um, to do a non-ressearchy task, but to actually just do a reasoning task, uh, is very good as well.\nI think that's whatever their next gen model is under.\nAre you paying the $200 a month?\nYes.\nWell, PSL is playing PSL.\nI probably would pay honest if it was me personally.\nUm, I think it's really good, but we've seen so many good things and 03 Mini is also really good.\nThat being said, too, I've been, uh, more and more a fan of Gemini.\nYeah, I've been, I've been leaning in towards the AI studio.\nI find myself going and using the the thinking.\nI still think it's a step below 01 Pro, but there are a lot of use cases.\nUm, that cost to value ratio is just so good.\nYeah.\nUm, and especially, I mean, flashlight, I ran 70,000 records through over the weekend and it cost me $260.\nI mean, man, there's some really good use cases for for that model.\nSo, that's been good.\nAnd then Sonnet, I find for design coding.\nUm, I was sharing a gentic kind of stuff.\nI was sharing when Killian, when when you walked in here, you heard me tell that story about oneshotting, uh, image analysis with like, you know, is it an image or a photo, graphic or a logo, you know, does it have words or not?\nTranscribe the words, what are the dominant colors, short transcription, large transcription, like subject list.\nI one shot getting all that from a single image times 32,000 images for 72 with Gemini.\nYeah, it's crazy.\nAnd I like how actually they have really good differentiation with the models of the light for just super cheap and fast.\nYeah.\nAnd then the regular, that's like a really reasonable cost option and the thinking is really smart and good and that contextually though the 2 million code for a lot of different things and I also I've been using it for um like transcription.\nOh yeah.\nUpload a video.\nI, I, I've lately just been like recording a lot of videos with business.\nYou know, personally, it's like instead of me taking a list of changes to make to a product.\nYeah.\nI upload it.\nI get the...\nThe only problem I've had because I love it.\nIt does diorization.\nYes.\nNot only that, but you can give it a video and say not only diorize it, but also figure out the person's names from the conversation.\nIt'll do a great job.\nThey're like, \"How did you and put it?\"\nAnd I want this exact format or follow the one from Hollywood Scripts, you know, whatever it is.\nAnd it does all in one shot.\nBut the only problem I've had is that it won't do because you're output limited.\nIt's 2 million input tokens, but you're output limited.\nSo, if you have an hourong video, you can't do it.\nRight.\nRight.\nHow do you overcome that?\nI've been doing short videos so I haven't had to worry about that.\nBut that is that is one of the limitations.\nThat's surprising.\nIs it 8,000?\nIt's like eight.\nIt's pretty small.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo if you were actually transcribing an hourong video, you'd have to either like use f ofmpeg to break it up and like write a script and put it'd be a pain.\nI use, I use deepgram for for that just so...\nOh, nice.\nYeah.\nThe other thing I've done if I know it's going to be long is I'll say do the first half and then wait for me to say continue and then like break it down.\nBut it's that's kind of...\nYeah.\nIt feels...\nYeah.\nJanky.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nInteresting.\nHave you used other things like the caching?\nGemini caching or or from one of the other renders.\nYeah.\nUm, a little bit.\nUm, I like what is it the...\nIs it OpenAI that does it automatically is really nice.\nI bet I implemented caching with Sonet 3.5 for um for Jacob, my coding agent.\nUm because that back and forth like it's just you save so much.\nInteresting.\nUh, with that, um, Google's is actually really hard to use.\nI haven't, I haven't done it with Gemini, but if I were to roll out a production...\nYeah.\nThing I would...\nYou have to kind of manage it.\nYeah.\nLike an hour.\nYou got there's a cash thing.\nYeah.\nAnd and and if you don't manage it, you and...\nYeah.\nBe worth it like cost.\nYeah.\nGreat.\nYeah.\nUm, another is, uh, they have code execution.\nDid you know this?\nMost people...\nA full sandbox generate and run the code, not just generate it.\nRun it.\nGive me the results.\nThat's pretty cool.\nThat is cool.\nOf course, grounding.\nHave you played with that?\nI've played with grounding.\nI've actually found though I've seen the listations of it pretty regularly.\nOh really?\nLike, like an example.\nSo one thing I've been using it for is um competitive analysis.\nSo we have a tool where we like come up start idea and a bunch of it's like, oh, we'll go do competitive analysis and so I've been using perplexity.\nI've been using with grounding and I'll find myself going through and spot checking and pretty quickly it's it's making stuff up.\nI bet it's found it's better than than some actually Perplexity and they've they've changed it recently.\nSo I was just the new thing but better than like the old sonar thing that Perplexity had.\nUm, but still not perfect.\nIs Perplexity just built on like Bing or did they have their own index?\nI think they, I think they were using a version of Llama and then they would fine-tune the R1.\nThey have an R1 thing and then they were using, I forget what their latest thing is based on, but for the web results.\nOh, the web results, I actually don't know.\nI, I want to say they...\nI actually don't know.\nInteresting.\nYeah.\nAnd then, uh, it's funny that that Google would would hallucinate search results like the one job you guys had.\nI was so shocked.\nI was so disappointed too because I thought like once I saw they had the grounding available and it went to you saw today, today open a...\nI know this video will come out later, but today that OpenAI dropped there as a search API.\nYeah.\nSo that'll be interesting.\nVery excited about that.\nCurious to see what you think of it versus your other experiment.\nYeah.\nPut on my list to try out.\nUm, very cool.\nThere's always something new to try.\nHow do you keep up with everything?\nHonestly, I spend a lot of time.\nYeah, it's fun.\nI, I generally, I, I'll go on, you know, axe or Twitter.\nIt's like I've got a handful of people I follow that I trust and when I see that they're, I've got like five people I trust saying, you got to try this thing.\nI'll try the thing.\nAlso at at PSL, we have, you know, a handful of engineers who are very deep in this and we have a Slack channel, so we share there.\nYeah.\nCool.\nUm, which is really good.\nAnd then yeah, a lot of it is just like, uh, me not sleeping well and waking up at 4 in the morning and being like, \"Oh, let's scroll a...\"\nSo yeah, played with images and video, uh, voice, anything any of those others?\nYeah, I, um, voice a little bit.\nI really like the modality of voice in, text out.\nUm, and so I, I actually have a a component that I built.\nIt's actually in my NextAI Starter Repo, which is basically a, uh, speech to text area, uh, text area.\nSo, it's text area with a little speech in.\nYeah.\nAnd it uses um Gro GQ.\nOh, yeah.\nAnd using a distilled, uh, Whisper on there.\nUm, so, super fast, super cheap, and is really high quality.\nSo, I think that's good.\nI use Super Whisper all the time on my laptop when I'm at home and not the office in my open office days.\nUm, and then yeah, in terms of like, you know, I actually I love um image generation.\nUh, I'm a subscriber to the uh MidJourney magazine of all things.\nI love my 5-year-old through the images, but I've been following MidJourney and and actually was was thinking about doing a AI image startup like 2022 some of that early stuff was out.\nWe've been playing with it at PSL since like back in like 2017 when we had the Nvidia, um, I forget what it was called, but really, really early models of of being able to tune um diffusion models and things like that.\nSo, um, it's been the area of interest and I think it's just more for fun.\nWe haven't been using it for work, but Sure.\nYeah.\nFun.\nCool.\nUm, is there anywhere that people can go to check out your work or your videos?\nYeah, so, um, I've got a YouTube channel.\nYou can search for Kevin Leneway.\nI actually don't even know the name of the stream.\nOh, but also a bunch of my um repositories are up.\nUh, you can just go to, uh, you know, uh, Github kenoy.\nUm, and got a handful of things.\nMy NextAI Starter is a really useful um template.\nIt's got some of my uh props and things in there.\nUm, and then as I build new things, I'll generally just throw them up here and and just let people play with them.\nMost of my stuff's just MIT, like I, I yeah, doing this for fun to teach people and it's really kind of super cool.\nThanks for sharing.\nIt was great to have you.\n[Music]\n",
