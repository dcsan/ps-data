  "cleanText": "Basically, imagine that you have some process like some container that you are running some process in, like an inference server or whatnot, and you put it on this machine that you don't trust. So it's baked into the hardware, and the entire memory for that process is encrypted. The host does not have the capability to access it. So even though it's running on your own machine, you would not be able to extract any information from out of there, and this is actually a very common technology.\n\n[Music]\n\nHello, New AI Tinkerers Podcast. I'm Joe, and this is one shot. This is our global stage where we talk to people who are on the forefront of generative AI and AI developments, doing interesting stuff. It's our chance to go a little deeper and to look under the hood and learn something that will enable you and your tinkering, too. Today, I'm very excited. We're with Tanya Verma from Tinfoil, which is a very early stage startup. Can I say you just got into Y Combinator yesterday?\n\nSure. Yeah. Just got into Y Combinator yesterday. Super early. Four co-founders in security and privacy, and we're going to dive in. Um, this is an area where I'm not deep. So, I'm going to be asking lots of questions, and hopefully you can show what you guys do and take us under the hood, but also kind of put things in perspective for us. Welcome to the show.\n\nThanks, Joe. Thanks for having me here. I'm really excited to get started, and yeah, love to talk about security and privacy any day.\n\nAwesome. And shout out to Austin and Octa who sponsored the meet up where we met and you presented.\n\nYeah, we had that was so fun. We had a takeover meet up on the theme of security because it was like we were all at a hackathon and people were building agents that were going off doing stuff autonomously, and people were kind of asking, \"Yeah, but how do I know? How do I lock this down?\" And no one had any answers? So we had a meet up, and you came and presented something, and I think sort of stole the show. So I wanted to talk to you. So here we are. Yeah, let's get started. Okay, really quick, what is your background for people?\n\nSo my background, so I I used to be at Cloudflare for over three years, uh, on the cryptography team, and I worked with a number of cryptography and uh, system security protocols that are widely used in the internet, and you're probably using one of those in your day-to-day lives. And I was always very interested in more lower level stuff, like systems programming and privacy in general. So yeah, here I am at Tinfoil now.\n\nDid you get into security while at Cloudflare or did you have a background?\n\nYeah, I so I didn't really have a PhD or anything. I just worked with these small satellites, and you had to encrypt the communication between the satellite and the ground station. So I just kind of ended up doing that as part of like a project at school and really loved that, and so I kind of just applied to work with more like cryptographic systems and protocols. And speaking of PhDs, your co-founder in the other room is about to defend his PhD thesis at MIT in secure computing, and you have four co-founders. What are their backgrounds?\n\nYeah. So his background is so he worked with Nvidia on confidential computing, which kind of forms like the basis of this company, and he has just a lot of background in like trusted hardware and whatnot. Our other co-founder, Sasha, is in multi-party computation and just other theoretical cryptographic techniques to protect data. And then our fourth co-founder, Nate, was actually an intern on the research team at Cloudflare, and he basically built a mini Cloudflare, and that's kind of how he got the job um when he was in high school. So yeah, very cool. All right, so why don't we just make it tangible? Can you show us something that you... I know it's super early stage company, but I know you have design partner customers, and you know, you're building some foundations already. So can you just show us?\n\nYeah, let's do it. So I'll start with really quick, like private chat. So none of these demos are going to be like very interesting because the whole point is to kind of make it underwhelming, like it the security and privacy should just work. Uh, it shouldn't be uh something that you as the user has to think about. So this is yeah, no one wants to think about that. So, so there's some kind of rag application here or something like so this is just like, you know, it's it's like private chat GBT, it's confidential chat GBT, so I can just ask it like, you know, hey, what's the weather?\n\nAnd this is running DeepSpeed Chat, so no tokens are leaving some secure thing, exactly that you're running. We will get more into what the secure thing is in a bit, but here, like every request you make is going to be confidential. And no one can see any of the data, like I, we, Tinfoil can't see it. The cloud provider can't see it. Any application provider that we... you can't see it. You're running it, but you can't see it.\n\nYeah, that's right. So if I called you and said, \"I've got a problem. Can you help me debug? Why don't you check, look at my prompt? Look at my data?\" You can't see any of that. We can't see any of that. So there's there's this whole like blackbox problem that kind of uh has been a huge issue with running confidential applications. And there are certain ways that you can get aggregated data out of it. We make all of that code public. So if we want to count the number of tokens that you're using to do pricing, we can do that. But like information that we take will be publicly available for you to see. So part of the security guarantee is you can actually look at some of this and see. So the vulnerabilities aren't just a mystery box that is maybe some hackers figured out or you have a back door. No, you can look at it. It's inspectable, right? So this is the actual code that's running, and we take all of the code that exists there, and we compute, we use GitHub actions to build it and then hash it in a particular way that yields this measurement that you see over here, and then we publish the digest on Six Store. So if I search for that specific digest on Six Door, I will find like this exact repo. So this is one part of the thing. You can look at the actual code. The source code is here. You can go on the repo. It's some kind of publicly verifiable. It's almost like an MD5 when you download a file or something. You can trace backs to some extent. So sort of yeah. And then the second part of that happens here is that this code when it's deployed in this confidential VM, like in the enclave, the CPU that has the secure virtualization verification features on and the Nvidia GPUs that has this confidential computing mode enabled computes a hash that takes into account all of the uh code and all of the register values. Basically, a hash of the across the entire state of the enclave and gives you this this digest, and then you just like check client side whether or not like the the hashes match. So the runtime and the source hash should match. And so that's how you know that the code that you were supposed to be running is actually the one that's running. And we can do this like, you know, everything is OpenAI API compatible. So like, you know, all you got to do is like pip install Tinfoil, and then you just yeah, like you pretty much just like run, instead of OpenAI, it's like, you know, Tinfoil AI that we're wrapping like every...\n\nSo there's a Tinfoil API component to get started that should be really easy and turnkey, but you mentioned a bunch of other stuff. Can you just quickly explain the architecture because you mentioned like enclave and secure hardware? Like for someone who doesn't know that stuff, could you at least paint the picture of what are all the components there?\n\nYeah. So the way to think about it is I'm going to simplify a bit, so it's not going to be completely accurate, but basically imagine that you have some process, like some container that you are running some process in, like an infrance server or whatnot, and you put it on this machine that you don't trust. So it's baked into the hardware, and the entire memory for that process is encrypted. The host does not have the capability to access it. So even though it's running on your own machine, you would not be able to extract any information from out of there. And this is actually a very common technology. It's used in your phone. If you have an iPhone, the little chip that stores and manages your biometrics is using the same concept. It's called a trusted execution environment. If you use tap to pay with your iPhone, that uses very similar technology. So it's just kind of an extension of that on the server side.\n\nIf I want that, like that cloud or or hardware component, is that something that I go to the big cloud guys and they offer as a type of of machine that I can I can access, or how does that, or is that something you're bringing to their architecture?\n\nYeah, so that's a that's a great question. There's certain cloud providers that offer some variation of it. So like AWS has something called AWS Nitro Enclaves, which doesn't give you the entire set of like promises, but it does offer you a a lot of the pieces, and you can just kind of like, you know, use it today, like you use the AWS Nitro SDK, and you can kind of run this enclave. You set up your container that doesn't give you access to GPU, so that's like CPU only. Here, AMD offers this virtual SEV SMP thing. You can extend the trust boundary of a CPU only process onto the GPU with Nvidia's confidential computing thing. Nvidia offers the hardware, but you have to have access to the BIOS to enable these settings, and like you have to load in, you know, like you have to make these kernel modifications, whatnot. So, there's no like cloud providers today that just offer this um completely. Um Azure has something called confidential VM that they released like a few months ago, but it's been in private preview, and it's definitely not like full service. It's like very difficult to use, and it's very easy to like shoot yourself in the foot because they literally give you SSH access into this encrypted enclave um for usability purposes.\n\nSo it sounds like the architecture has been around for a while, particularly like in maybe embedded hardware or something like that. But in the cloud world, is it a newer thing, it sounds like?\n\nOr so it's not new at all. It's actually so for CPU only, it's been around for a while. So you might have heard of like Intel SGX, like it got like a really bad rap. Like there were a lot of attacks against it. Um, but a lot of that happened because they also decided to put that into like consumer hardware. Okay. However, for the the server world, like this has always existed. It's just like very difficult to use to create like functional applications. And then there's one other like kind of really neat thing about AI that makes all of this possible. It's like my co-founder puts it, like AI was put on the on this earth by God to like, you know, use confidential computing because like AI applications and AI inference in particular is stateless, and the way that these enclaves work, like there's no state, like there's nothing that you can kind of bootstrap from. So all state is lost as soon as the enclave dies, and that's perfect for inference, cuz you just you don't need any state. Okay.\n\nSo I kind of have this this picture now of this architecture. Yeah. The solution which you're bridging my world of an application developer wanting secure something in a way that you're giving me like mathematically cryptographically secure down to the hardware through that architecture. How does that compare to like, so people go out and they have a SAS startup and they get SOC compliance, feels like a bunch of paperwork and cross your fingers. Is that a wrong characterization? But how do you contrast those two?\n\nIt's basically right. So, we're actually going through this process, like we're trying to get SOC and GDPR with like Vanta right now, and I I think those compliance check boxes, like they raise the bar for sure, you know, if you're committing your API keys into dissing them. I'm just trying to put it in context, like yeah, I think we're all familiar with what SOC is, and this we're not as familiar with. So, how do you conf...\n\nYeah. So that is much more like, you know, it's it's like check boxes. It's like honor system. There's no honor system doesn't really work when you have a data leak, right? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nDo you worry about... I mean, we live in a world where you could wake up every few weeks and see a major leak, credit card data, whatever. So whatever your intentions are with and your certifications, you may still have a leak if the data is there and it might get out. Once it's out, you can't bring it back.\n\nYeah. And with computing becoming cheaper and cheaper, this intelligent computing on top of the data, data is cheaper to move around a store, it's more flexible. It's easier to infer over it. Do you worry about... I mean, leaks, the the sort of... I don't know what the what is the security word for the value of a leak, the the the detriment that a leak could have, all things equal, seems to be going up because I I could leak log files and credit card and whatever, that's anonymous, and I couldn't... I just use GenAI to figure out who the people are in that data, whereas that would have been hard a few years ago, right?\n\nDefinitely. Yeah, so it's also just like the sheer scale of data that has to go into AI to make it useful and to imbue it with the capabilities that we wanted to have. People want that data more than ever. So that data wants to be leaked now. And it's not even that you as the you know, AI startup that's offering the service, like wants to leak it, like maybe you want to protect your access controls in place. It's just that sometimes things get transferred in different ways that you as an organization may not even know about, and it ends up in some fun backup production on a laptop. The employee loses it on an airplane, and that the incentive in Gen AI is more context works better.\n\nExactly. And so you're now talk about company use cases. I think people rolling out genai talk about security, they care. What are some of those use cases that where it's especially important to have like secure private use of Gen AI? Where where is the demand coming from?\n\nA lot of the demand comes from the need to protect your proprietary data as a company. Like say you want to do internal rag, like you want to ask questions across, you know, Salesforce and Jira and GitHub and uh your entire Slack. Mhm. What do you do right now? Like you basically have only one real option if you care a lot about the the security of that data, which is to do everything on prem, and that's not particularly scalable as we keep adding more and more AI solutions just across different\n\n\nBusiness functions, and it's just complex to maintain. It's complex to manage, and so that's one place that we've really seen interest across your proprietary data. I think a year ago, if you'd said, \"Yeah, I care about security and privacy, so let's put it on prem,\" you would have been looking at a lot less good results. Like, the open-source models were not that far, were pretty far behind at that time, and now you can see state-of-the-art within a month or two or weeks. Yeah, is that accurate?\n\nYeah, that's definitely accurate. I mean, especially with like DeepSeek 671B, like the state-of-the-art is equivalent in some cases, if not better than, like, the models that many of these AI application providers are in fact. Okay. So there was that case of, like, there's a guy who posted on Twitter, like, \"It's phoning home.\" There's proof. Is that true? Is it phoning home?\n\nIf you're using, if you're using the DeepSeek API, then, well, you're phoning home for it. You're just sending it all to China. But if you're downloading the weights and running it, it's not able to phone home. Definitely not. It's just a file. And if you use Tinfoil, then, like, it can't, like, there's, you can prove that it's not phoning home. Yeah. Right. Okay, because you're like airgapped or, or essentially because it's essentially airgapped just because of the hardware primitives. Okay.\n\nYou're not a commercial company really yet. You're working with side partners, right? So I assume that that conversation of, is that a, is that an interesting conversation? Like, we care about privacy and security. Let's use this Chinese model. Like, is, is that consistent?\n\nI mean, that's because it's the best model in terms of reason. It's a model file. It doesn't really matter, like, in the open-source world, like, it doesn't matter, like, where weights come from. It's like, is it the best weights? And that's that's the competition.\n\nSo, what are your insights on Llama nextG models and where they are and how do they compare to DeepSeek today?\n\nThe Llama 3.370B is better than the distilled version of DeepSeek 70B, but Llama's largest model, 405B, is definitely worse than, like, the 671B. I know that, like, there's new models, new Llama models coming out. So, I guess we'll see pretty soon, like, what is the runtime and compute comparison on those two? Um, so for 70B, it's like, you know, it's like a drop-in, like, structurally drop-in replacement. So it's like the same exact, it, it takes the same exact amount of, but for 671B, I believe that it's, it's actually more efficient than, it's much more efficient than, like, running, like, you know, say something like 405B, just because, just because of this, like, mixture of experts architecture. I know I haven't ever tried to run 405B. I've only run 671B, and that, like, that needs, like, six H200s approximately. Um, but, you know, that's, yeah, that's doable.\n\nOkay, we talked about some of the verticals. I can imagine healthcare, finance, well, anything where a company's proprietary data doesn't want to be sent over the wire, right? And it's important. So now you're in this, this system that's verifiably secure, not going to leave. Let's talk though about the sort of logical architecture, if that even is the right word. You're sitting in a large corporation, there are different silos, there are different privileges towards data and actions. Obviously, if you're working in support, you have different privileges than someone working in accounting versus engineering versus, how does that play into your solution, or does it? Are you just sort of a lower level, like, now put, put it in there however you want to put it in and get it out? It's secure in that way, but in terms of, like, who has access to what questions to be answered from your data sources, is that application layer, or do you get involved there?\n\nYeah, that, so what you're asking is, I believe the term is called, like, access control, data governance at, like, the application layer. Yes. Uh, but we, we, we've been thinking a lot about that. Um, just in terms of, like, you know, integrating into, like, SSO's and, uh, figuring stuff out with that. Um, that's, uh, basically what you do is you encrypt the, the internal part, like, the part of the request that you want to keep private, say, like, the actual, like, you know, prompt and, like, the input query, and you encrypt that with, like, a key that's only known to the enclave that it generated when it, when it sort of spun up, and then you put in another, like, HTTP packet where all the headers are exposed, and that's where you do all of these, like, access control verifications, because that, that doesn't necessarily need to be a tested code, like, there's no, like, provable security requirements. That's more like just enforcement and access control. So if you structure your application this way, um, it works like the, the, basically the problem is that TLS, like, encrypts headers, and if you, if you're directly terminating TLS, like, inside the enclave, there's, there's no one else that can see any other part of the request. But if you do this sort of two-step process, then you can do whatever access control and governance and integration.\n\nIs there a standard around that approach?\n\nThere is. So, it's actually called oblivious HTTP, where it's kind of like a one-hop VPN. It's a little different from a VPN, but basically it, it, it lets you strip away certain parts of the information and request and only expose some certain other parts to another party. So, this is used in a number of different technologies. Apple uses that for a number of different things.\n\nAll right. So, going back to the demo that you showed, let's say I'm practically speaking working at a company building a RAG system. We need to keep this, this is really sensitive data, where a hedge fund, whatever it is, and so, yeah, I don't want to go in over to OpenAI or China. I want it local. I want to run it. I want more than SOC2. I like this idea tied down, provably, ma, not even you can see it. The company I've, I've hired to help build this can't even see it. That's amazing. Tactically, how do I get started? Like, what do I do? What does that part look like? As what's the developer experience?\n\nYeah, so for, you know, if you're just using an off-the-shelf model, like, all you have to do is switch out, like, api.openai.com with API.tinfoil.sh, and that's it, because we're, like, our inference API is open compatible.\n\nSo if I'm a developer and I want to use this for my solution, I want the guarantee of the hardware all the way down to the hardware security that you can't even see my data. I like that. Tactically, how do I get started? Like, what is the developer experience?\n\nYou can simply use one of our many client-side SDKs. So we have stuff for Python, JavaScript, Swift, Go, etc. And it's all OpenAI compatible. So instead of using API.opi.com or whatever, you would just replace that with API.foil.sh, and it's like the same chat completions endpoint, the same embedding end point.\n\nSo if I had the RAG app working, a prototype, a limited set of data, and it's going over the wire to OpenAI, I could switch over to this just with an SDK switch, API compatible, and then what's happening? It's now talking to something that I've deployed, or that you've deployed, or how does that work?\n\nSo yeah, something that we've deployed. So we have, like, we support a number of different models just out of the box, um, a lot of your standard models, like DeepSeek, Llama, etc. But if you do want to deploy a custom model, then, yeah, reach out to us and we can make that happen.\n\nSo you have some stuff waiting and ready and waiting that I can, I can tap into quickly and get started. Okay. And then, and then other than that, like, what else is, is there for me? Do I have, how do I, I still get the inputs and outputs on my application side. So I'm everything's the same in terms of evals and using it. Is there any other consideration in terms of, like, monitoring the system or uptime or scaling? How does that part work?\n\nSo monitoring is, like, like I mentioned before, like, everything that comes out of this black box needs to be publicly committed to. So it makes it, makes it a bit more challenging, but we support Prometheus compatible metrics for a lot of, like, standard inference server metrics, like, you know, time to first token, number of tokens used per account, like that, right? 'Cause all that data exhaust is happening inside your enclave.\n\nIt's inside the, is enclave the generic term for a secure compute environment of this type?\n\nThere's a number of terms, like, trusted execution environment, Secure Enclave. Um, people use those interchangeably.\n\nOkay. But I can't reach in there and see anything that's happening. So including data around the prompts and how often they're run and the runtime, right?\n\nYeah. So there would be, for you, there would be, like, a metrics endpoint that's kind of set up that's collecting all of this data, and we do a level of aggregation. So we don't just, like, send that data out, like, you know, for per request. You can set, like, whatever threshold that you want to aggregate over, but again, all of that code is, like, publicly committed to. So you can't really collect something post talk, like, there's, you can't add, like, a metric that you have to set it up as a little component, turn it on, decide to use it, and then it's verifiably part of the system that I've decided to use, then it's calling out and pushing data somewhere.\n\nExactly. Exactly. But there's, you can't just, like, you know, I decided to train on someone's data, like that, you can't do it, 'cause you would have to completely change the system and change the code, and it's all public.\n\nOkay. So now I have that set up, and I know, oh, wow, we're growing. I need another machine. How do we scale?\n\nYeah. So that's, that's actually not that difficult. You just add another enclave that, and you can do, like, you know, routing at, like, the TCP layer.\n\nOkay. It's simple. It's, it's not totally simple. There's definitely, like, some challenges.\n\nSimple if you worked at Cloudflare and difficult otherwise, or is it simple?\n\nIt's, it's medium simple if you worked at Cloudflare. But yeah. Yeah. 'Cause you, you, you have to route it, like, the, you have to do a lot of, like, rate limiting and routing at, like, the TCP layer. So you, yeah.\n\nOkay. What are some of the use cases? We talked about RAG, and we talked about a couple industries. I just want to dig into there, like, where are you seeing, and maybe it's too early, but where are you seeing the demand? Like, where are people, like, this is the, we must have this?\n\nYeah, so it's actually kind of interesting. We, we see a lot of, like, almost B2C type users that that want to use it. So, you know, like, subreddits, like, local Llama, like, people are very interested in privacy for the subreddit channel on privacy is interested in privacy, or Reddit is interested, no, like, so there's this subreddit that has a lot of open-source first, like, model users, you could call it, is go local Llama. It's really active. It's really good. A lot of, like, the advances in, in, like, quantization and whatnot that make these models, like, easy to run on, you know, consumer hardware, have kind of come from that subreddit.\n\nSo, so the community there is interested in security because it's a differentiator for local mod.\n\nThe only way to achieve it, right?\n\nIs that exactly? It's like, you know, on prem, technically, if it's local. Well, that's one of the exciting things about open models. Yeah, I control them. I, I control them. I read it. But unfortunately, you are bottlenecked by the fact that you only have so much hardware, uh, to run it. So, uh, those are some people that have been interested. And then my, my favorite use, want to hear my favorite use case?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I to run a local model, like DeepSeek, a multimodal model in my house. Mhm. to look at my security cameras, some of which are inside the house, because if I'm walking around in my underwear, I don't need that on the internet. But I do want to know if the person walking around in the underwear is not part of our family, right? And I could build this system in a weekend, right? But I needed to be on prem, right? Otherwise, I would have built it already except for the security problem.\n\nThat's interesting. But it's also interesting to think about, even if my house is broken into and somebody steals the hard drive, I still am protected. And that's what you could offer. You described I walk up developer experience and I start using your API, I'm good. You're kind of managing, because there's a piece to it that's like the cloud, and there's the, the hardware, which depends on the cloud vendor. But if I wanted to say, no, I just want to license your stuff. I'm the CIA. I want to run it. We'll handle it. Do you work that way too, or so?\n\nYeah. So we could do an on-prem model of the same infrastructure. I guess the selling point of this is you don't need to, because you don't need to trust the hardware, uh, you don't need to trust the cloud provider, you don't need to, uh, trust Tinfoil. So you don't really need to do that. But yeah, if you are extra paranoid and you really, like, you're worried about, like, physical attacks and, like, which are very hard to mount, but if you're CIA, that's a reasonable concern. Yes, like, we can offer an on-prem version as long as your infra supports bare metal access, and we are allowed to make these changes and modifications to the kernel, which is not always true. It's actually been pretty hard to get that kind of infra set up.\n\nI know it's secure. So I, I read the one sheet you've, I've talked to you. I, I know about Nitro and all this stuff, and I use the SDK, and now I'm running my app. But how do I know it's actually doing all the things you just said it was? How do I know you can't see it? I know that you've walked me through the cryptographic reasons to believe down to the, you know, the colonel mods, but how do I actually verifiably know that without trusting you? Does that make sense? Is there a mechanism for that?\n\nYeah. Well, that you don't have to trust us. Like, you can look yourself, and we will, I look how you look at the public GitHub code. You look at, like, the six store transparency log.\n\nDo I need a PhD in cryptography to look at that code and really understand that it's verified, like, it's a thesis I wrote? You know, I have to do the math.\n\nYeah. I mean, you might not need a PhD in cryptography. One of our co-founders dropped out of college. So, definitely don't need a PhD, but it is very, the word, like, tenuous, almost like brittle. Like, it's very easy for one step to break and for people to not notice. So it's very hard to do end to end.\n\n\nIn a way that makes the interface clean.\nAnd I think a large part of the work that we want to do is communicating this promise, like how is it secure?\nHow do you believe it?\nUm, I would imagine you'll have a community like you have in the Reddit and other places, but for security.\nYeah.\nAnd people also testing it and sharing that.\nIf you're open about that and transparent, then there can be a trust that's built through that collective.\nSo we absolutely want to do that.\nLike a lot of the public-facing code, I mean, it's all open source.\nSo yeah, there's a lot of that you can do, and we will get like audits from like, you know, really high-quality firms.\nThere's Trail of Bits, there's NCC in a few months once the system kind of matures a little bit.\nBut can we talk about the frontier of security and generative AI?\nActually, just in the last month, there have been two announcements of quantum chips.\nWhat happens then to all of this stuff?\nWhat's the buzz within the research and secure computing community around that topic, for example?\nSo the intersection, the quantum stuff, like that's been going on for a long time.\nThere's a number of updates to TLS that support these post-quantum secure cipher suites that, well, they're post-quantum secure at least until now.\nSo mathematically, they have basically their math that's going to say we're okay even if the computer gets that much faster.\nExactly.\nSo that already exists.\nUm, and so if you use that in TLS, and that's available in Chrome today, you can use that now in your architecture if you wanted to.\nNot even theoretically, like we could use it, like practically, it would not be like too much of a lift, and a lot of the attestation stuff that's all post-quantum secure anyway, just because it's not based on like the math problems that are broken by switch to quantum.\nCool.\nGood.\nOkay.\nGreat.\nSo, we don't have to be too worried about at least some of it.\nWhat is happening on the You know, we're all familiar with prompt injection.\nI have to ignore all previous instructions.\nH of course, which is a motto for life.\nMhm.\nBut also prompt injection.\nSo true.\nWhat is the frontier of security more broadly in generative AI right now?\nWhat are the problems that people are really struggling with now in industry, like on the research?\nWhat are people researching and where's that frontier?\nYeah.\nSo, if you think about keeping model data private, that's that's not that hasn't really caught up at all.\nLike there's not that many companies that are doing things that we're doing.\nLike it's, you know, a bunch of on-prem stuff or like just these brittle contracts or just kind of putting like the AI stamp on traditional cybersecurity best practices.\nUh, like you're doing PII reduction, like there's some strange transforms that you can do, um, that are not really grounded in any solid problems.\nSo there's that one aspect, which is more on the security and confidentiality side of things.\nUh, but then there's a lot of the kind of work around guardrails and watermarking and um, just variations on that, like prompt injection attacks.\nUm, my personal take is like prompt injection is never going to be a solved problem, just the nature of the problem, like it's kind of cat and mouse, like you will always be able to, but I yeah, that's an area I'm maybe less interested in just because it's a bit more like fuzzy.\nBut I think there's a lot of cool work that Anthropic is doing with ability and just kind of understanding what causes models to diverge from, like, you know, what um, they were supposed to be doing.\nUm, and I yeah, I'm excited to follow that.\nBut yeah, there's a surprisingly not that much intersection that I've seen between these two communities.\nAnd the third category is like, if I have a model, how do we extract input data from it?\nAnd that's useful because it can help validate copyright claims.\nWhat do you think about agents and actions?\nI've been excited by AI from the standpoint of, well, the accessibility, text in, text out, and intelligence on tap.\nThat's great.\nYeah.\nBut it still just creates work and summarizes information.\nWhen it can click and push buttons, that's where it gets exciting.\nThe first time I ever saw that was actually someone going to the Killian, you know, open interpreter.\nVery popular open source.\nThe first thing that that was like, let's just give it the ability to be logged in as you on your computer and do stuff.\nYeah.\nVery dangerous.\nYeah.\nBut very powerful.\nYeah.\nAnd um, that was the first time I ever saw.\nNow we've got computer control and browser control, and there's frameworks dropping every day to do stuff.\nWhat is your point of view on the security implications of that world?\nYeah.\nSo a deep reason why I want like the security and privacy story to work is because I want to use agents in this way, and I really have problems with trust, trusting any of these providers.\nAnd I think the story there is, it's really bad, quite frankly.\nThere's not even like access control that's figured out because like if you just think about access control, like it was never designed to be used.\nThere's like this concept of service accounts which you can use, but the idea that an autonomous system is going to use and navigate UIs and workflows in this autonomous way.\nYeah.\nJust doesn't really exist.\nAnd so I think we're going to have to come up with more frameworks.\nThere's a lot that you can lift, like short-term tokens there.\nThere's ways to design around it, but this whole idea that it's acting like a human but not as a particular service that has a very defined interface is interesting.\nAnd like maybe there's going to be a switch to that, but I almost want the switch to be like, yeah, it just acts on behalf of the human.\nI think that that will make the integration a lot easier, especially in the earlier years.\nKind of like self-driving cars is what I think, right?\nLike they need to be able to work with normal human traffic, and then eventually one day it's going to be all self-driving cars and they can have their own protocols and not do you even in that world there's still going to be mistakes, right?\nDo you think the right way to look at agents is, I mean, some people I think must look at self-driving car like basically number of dead people per mile driven or something, you know, like humans drive, there you could measure that number.\nYeah.\nAnd AIs drive and you can measure that number, and if the AIs are collectively better, then we should be okay, even though people are dying, even though a robot made a person die because on average it's safer.\nYeah.\nIs that how we should think about security and agents, or do we need to actually aspire to a solution?\nAre people going to say, \"No, you can't use browser control at my company because we can't afford, even though your employees will make mistakes.\nWe'll lie.\nYour humans do things unintentionally or not that could be worse than the AI.\nHow can you, how do you weigh this?\"\nI think that's like a philosophical question.\nI think that's just something like we expect more from like the robots, like, you know, Cruz makes like one mistake and like they're out.\nM is that just because of the point in time we're on in as a society that we don't collective, we're not used to it yet.\nIt would be like, I can't imagine what it was like during the transition to seat belts.\nBut I can imagine it was similar.\nI bet at first it was like people resisted seat belts and there were studies on seat and who knows, right?\nI don't know the history.\nBut when we say, oh, they had one accident, shut it down.\nI think it's really going to depend on the type of application.\nI think there there's a lot of applications like where it just doesn't matter, like if your AI filter on Tik Tok, like doesn't do like a 100% perfect job, like it doesn't matter, but like, you know, if the the Delta chatbot tells like the the customer, then yeah, we'll give you a refund, um, that's an agent that like, you know, cannot say that.\nSo I think we have these sorts of structured outputs, guardrails for AI, um, even today in a very lower level sense.\nBut I think eventually if we can kind of do that for agents, build frameworks around what is the possible restriction, like what can you not do, like what is just out of bands.\nBut is anyone working on that?\nIt feels like from looking at the space, no one is working on that.\nThey're they're just trying to let the agents go as fast and far as they can and do or do everything.\nIs anyone looking at that?\nI I have no clue, honestly.\nI think like agents will have to like kind of materialize a bit more for that to even start making sense in some ways.\nI think up until now it was like there are too many points of failures, like the probabilities of all the individual actions just blew up.\nI think we're definitely getting that down now.\nSo think once that starts to mature a bit, then people will demand more of what it is, cuz it's also like, you know, there's simple problems that need to be solved, like if there's a website that says, hey, buy this ticket, and the agent's like, okay, buy this ticket, it's like spam, but I think all of those problems are like, you know, humans have solved it, like agents will get there.\nI don't think any of that is like fundamentally unsolvable.\nTurning to other stuff, you're here in the Bay Area.\nWhat are some interesting things you've seen that are kind of bubbling up for you that are that are not in the area that you're working on, but you thought were cool and impressive in a way?\nYeah, I find distributed training very interesting, and I've been interested in it for like a couple years now, and I've been starting to see runs where people train across these like not necessarily private data sets, but just across like different GPUs.\nI I want to see how more of that pans out just because what is the unlock of distributed training?\nIt's that I don't have to give up my private data, but I can still train models across it.\nAnd then you can kind of create all these marketplaces of leasing my data.\nSo if I'm a creator, I can monetize that data without fully giving it away.\nBut when you have a trained model, you can also steal the data that way, right?\nI get the term for it, but when you have a model, you can distill it out.\nThis is for more like I have some much more interesting data.\nLike I have really interesting data that is not publicly available on the internet that I don't want to make publicly available, but I want to collaborate with other institutions without giving my secret sauce away.\nWe all kind of mutually benefit.\nAnd there's also the privacy angle where I want to improve these systems.\nI have self-driving cars.\nThey're recording everything.\nI have the chip in my brain and it's recording everything.\nI want to make the models better, but I don't want to necessarily be able to see all of that data.\nYeah.\nSo that's so it's sort of empowering people to not not have the power all concentrated is sort of a theme aside from security in that inherent in that.\nYeah.\nIn a way, like otherwise we're just waiting for the frontier models to do our thing for us, right?\nYeah.\nI mean, I'm like really looking forward to like more open source.\nI'm so happy that DeepSpeed exists.\nLike I'm just I Yeah, I really enjoyed playing with it.\nI'm very excited to see all like the other stuff that's happening in like the open source world.\nLike I really think that having access to like playing, you know, being able to play with these larger models and like build our own like systems with them is like super interesting.\nOkay.\nSo briefly, what is your IDE setup right now?\nWhat are you using these days?\nHonestly, just Cursor.\nCursor.\nYeah.\nHave you tried Windsurf?\nHave you tried the new Anthropic?\nI tried Windsurf.\nI've not gotten a chance to try the new cloud one, but yeah, I mean Windsurf is also good, I guess.\nIn terms of how did you, we met at AI Tinkers, but how did you first find out about AI Tinkers?\nWas that your first or have you been before or heard about it?\nI'm just curious.\nIt was the one.\nSo, basically, I would not leave my apartment if my co-founders were not here.\nSo, I was like, I need to go outside.\nIt was really close.\nAnd so, I was like, okay, I'm going to go and I'm going to talk to like two people.\nI'm going to come back home cuz it's literally like, you know, a few blocks from where I live.\nI showed up and I had a great time and I really enjoyed it and then I I kept going.\nAwesome.\nThank you for doing that.\nWhat about you?\nAre you tinkering on anything when you see some new text to speech or video thing or something not related?\nAre you pulling it down and playing with it?\nAre you building stuff for fun?\nLike Yeah, I was tinkering a lot with some of this distributed training stuff and even distributed inference.\nLike there's this one company, it's called Exa, I believe.\nOh, yeah.\nAnd you can if you have like two different machines, like you know, just consumer hard GPUs, like you can kind of like do distributed inference from like, you know, quantized model.\nSo it's like messing around with that.\nI definitely like love to like check out like every new model that drops at.\nWe should bring bring the distributed stuff to tonight's meet up downtown San Francisco.\nWe're doing science fair.\nSo it's basically like, you know, the stage is like what you did and you got to be a little more prepared.\nBut science fair is just like I'm just going to flip my laptop open and show stuff on building work like right now.\nAnyways, thank you so much for your time and the education on security and what you're doing and found it very illuminating.\nThank you so much.\nThanks.\nYeah.\nWhere can people find out more?\nJust send me an email or LinkedIn message.\nTanya@tinfoil.sh.\nAwesome.\nThank you.\nThanks, Tanya.\nThanks.\n[Music]\n",
