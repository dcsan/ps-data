  "cleanText": "[Music]\nVan started tracking the white van.\n[Music]\nAll right, hello AI tinkerers, and welcome to One-Shot.\nThis is our global stage where we bring people from the community and give them a chance to go a little deeper, look under the hood, see if we can learn something from their projects.\nAnd today, I am super excited.\nI'm thrilled to have you.\nThis is Maxwell Wang, a software engineer at SpaceX and the creator of Drone Dispatcher, which is a side project that's incredible.\nIt's an AI-powered drone voice control.\nI saw it on Twitter, and then I ran into you at the hackathon, and I saw it right away.\nI knew exactly who you were, and I was just... and then you were tracking me moments later on your laptop, so it was awesome.\nThanks, Maxwell.\nYeah, it was really nice to meet you at the hackathon.\nI didn't think you would be there, but yeah, I was glad to bring it out and show it to some people, and the reception seemed to be pretty good.\nIt's a pretty amazing project.\nThere's a lot of components to it, and um, I'm just excited to like dig in.\nSo why don't we get to like your background all that later and just dive right in?\nSure.\nYou want me to play the video?\nYeah, yeah, let's do that.\nDrone Dispatcher, ready.\nOver.\nCan you go check how busy the nearest Trader Joe's is and route to the nearest Trader Joe's?\nDrone's going a little slow.\nCan you increase it to 10 m/s?\nSpeed set to 10 m/s.\nContinuing to Trader Joe's.\nDrone has arrived at Trader Joe's.\nTraffic looks moderate.\nYou actually overshot a little bit.\nCan you back up 50 m and then take a look?\nBack up 50 m.\nPositioned correctly.\nChecking the area now.\nTrader Joe's parking lot is visible now.\nThe parking area shows light to moderate activity.\nStart tracking the white van.\n[Music]\nVan started tracking the white van.\nIf the drone's power is below 70%, please send it home.\n[Music]\nDrone's battery below 70%.\nReturning home.\nArea appears clear and suitable for landing.\nProceed with the return to home function.\nNow, awesome, awesome.\nThank you.\nOkay, super cool.\nObviously, a lot going on there when you consider all the pieces and the telepan and everything else.\nYeah, but why don't you, just for the sake of like understanding all that's there, from the moment someone says something like \"back up 50 m\" or \"increase speed,\" what are all the pieces that are touched along the way?\nYeah, so whenever I like to explain this to people, I break it down into three components, and that's basically the architecture of the system.\nAnd the three biggest parts are: you have a user interface that someone can talk to and interact with, you have a cloud backend that runs all the smarts, all the AI, some of the heavy workloads, and then you have the drone itself.\nAnd what happens when someone asks for a command, they go through the UI.\nRight now, we currently have them press the space bar, and then that allows them to start talking.\nUh, from there, your voice goes to the AI backend where it's processed, turned into text.\nThe text is parsed into a large language model, and from there, functions are called, and then the drone action appears, and then you see it happen on your screen like magic.\nOkay, so these function calls are then... uh, are something... do you have like a DSL or something in mind with like a set of like functions that you can do?\nLike, you got a gimbal and a camera that can move.\nWhat are the actions that can happen?\nWhat are the tools, I guess?\nUh, what's a DSL, like a domain-specific language, for your...\nOh, I see.\nYeah, so early on in the project, the first thing that I built was that interface between the drone and an LLM.\nSo the interface is really similar to what a web UI would look like.\nSo as long as you build out those the major functionalities, like moving the drone, pointing the camera, once you build out that interface, then you're able to interact with it.\nI first built the the web UI, so you everything you can do, tell the drone to do over voice, you can tell it to do on the UI.\nOkay, so you just you build a basically push-button interface, and then now you have an LLM that just translates to that.\nCorrect, that.\nYeah, so there actually there are a couple things that you can't do over over the interface, but you can do over voice.\nHowever, it's that the general idea of like an abstracted interface is what what allows this to happen.\nOkay.\nThen there's other pieces, like I know from talking to you the other day that that you've got an Nvidia GPU running on the drone.\nAnd so let's talk about the hardware component.\nSure.\nLike, this is not an off-the-shelf drone, for one thing, and you've got a GPU on there.\nLet's talk through all the hardware, like what is there.\nUh, I'll share what I'm willing to share, but the high-level overview is, is I'm treating the drone like an IoT platform.\nIt is a basically just a flying Linux computer.\nYeah, and uh, in order to get it to have unlimited range and not be constrained by that and like a a radio link, you just send everything over IP, right?\nSo yep, there's a 5G module on board.\nEventually, I would like to get Starlink on it.\nLike, imagine it just flies off.\nYeah, I think you might know somebody who could help you.\nYeah, I don't know.\nMaybe I'll grab one off the liners.\nBut I think the the main thing is the compute on board has to be just powerful enough to run the real-time stuff.\nYeah, as well as communicate with the more powerful AI back end.\nAre the real-time... you mean like for tracking when we saw track the white van, and there's a square, that's all local?\nYes.\nSo stuff that has to be happening in real time because the even if the, let's say, the models in the cloud were instantaneous, that latency between 5G and the whatever API calls you're doing still take some time.\nSo stuff that needs to be close to the camera needs to be run real time.\nSo tracking is one of those examples.\nYeah.\nDid you have versions of this that were completely over the wire and were pretty crude and slow, and then you kind of evolved to that more real time?\nDid you know from the beginning that... right?\nSo I think the model that I went with, 'cause I used to build a lot of these pre-systems at my previous place, Paladin, and I think from that base, I already knew what to do and what not to do.\nSo when we when I began to architect this system, it was like, I'm going to... I'm going to start from scratch, but I know the the lessons that I've learned along the way and some of the things that you shouldn't and should do to make the system more extensible and easier to use.\nYeah.\nIs it... is it doing like a web RTC over this this 4G connection, or is it just doing requests like socket, like HTTP quests, like you would call, like if you're building a crude web app or something like... are you getting to that level of like sophistication, I guess, for the latency?\nUm, I think for now, we... I think you saw in my code, but the a lot of the message passing, if it's not video, I try to use MQTT, or really any... what is MQTT?\nOh, MQTT is a IoT-based messaging protocol.\nI'm the... the real seller there is that you're able to control the quality of service, so you can... I think it might... I'm not sure if it's built on UDP or TCP, but being able to specify that quality of service is really important for a low-bandwidth application like drones, where you need to... there might be a lossy connection, especially since it's flying and reconnecting with cell towers.\nIs that a piece that you're comfortable showing us the code for, or is there some piece of it that would be, you know, for someone liking to hack on drones and voice control, or just voice control in general?\nUh, let me see what I shared with you guys for the uh, other for the hackathon.\nOkay, cool.\nUh, where's my mouse?\nSo here we can see the one of the message receivers for MQTT.\nSo MQTT, um, allows you to do kind of event-driven stuff, and every time that a event shows up from MQTT, the message is really simple, like JSON format, and from there, you can specify commands, like creating a tracker, adding a track, changing the tracking mode, telling the gimbal to stop, zoom in, or zoom out.\nSo because it's over and it's like a... it works over a lossy connection, you can specify quality of service to retry until it happens.\nOh, and one of the really cool features is that you can have a um, send a message when you connect, called a... I think a like a kill message, or like the the last last will message, so like right before you die, it sends a will, yeah, that says that you can tell the user that the drone has died with the last like something's actually gone wrong over that connection.\nInteresting.\nYeah, that's really cool.\nSo it's basically a best-effort communication protocol for IoT with some bells and whistles like that.\nDo you use... is it primarily used in IoT systems, or with there's wireless or some other...\nYeah, so it's it's a lighter... it's a lightweight when you want it to be, and it's a little heavier and has some retries when you don't want it to be.\nSo when... like I used to use REST API for everything, and that still works great, but like over... I've seen over a lossy connection, this is probably the best way to go, really.\nWow, cool.\nOkay, so if you're doing anything with like basically a 4G card of any kind, for whatever security camera, anything, any system that has a protocol of any kind, you you're control the protocol, I assume you you you define the messaging, like this, move gimbal, whatever, it's just the transport.\nOkay, cool.\nAnd then what is it implemented in?\nLike, what what platforms can you can you use it at?\nNo, funny you should ask.\nSo MQTT is supported by all major languages.\nUm, I think it's supported by... there's a couple people who who support it.\nOne of the really helpful things was EMQX.\nThey're a... they host a broker, and actually, hold on, maybe my my keys are in here.\nYeah, yeah, you might have to redact that, but the... they host a broker.\nYou can host it yourself, but to get started, I what I was using was their online client and their broker, and that allows you to send test messages.\nIt takes like 10 minutes, you can learn the protocol pretty quickly.\nYeah, very cool.\nNeat, that's great.\nAll right, so um, back to like the the van tracking thing, you're running uh, some kind of uh, vision model or something to do that, right?\nIt's got to be local because of the speed, right?\nWhat are you doing there?\nIs that like an open-source thing, or or something you trained, or how?\nYeah, so that was the previous generation before when I made the video a couple weeks ago, a couple months ago, yeah.\nAnd Grounding DINO was the main thing that was used.\nIf you're like active in the computer vision space, you know that Grounding DINO was this paper released like two years ago that is really good at open-set tracking and referring expression.\nThat's where the grounding comes in.\nOkay.\nAnd in order for you to track a white van, you basically take that message, \"white van\" or \"white van on the driveway\" or \"the white van on the right,\" and it will it be able to put a pound a bounding box around it, and then you pass that bounding box to a lower-level algorithm that can do the tracking.\nOkay, but the object identification would be done by Grounding DINO.\nThat seems like a pretty heavyweight vision model thing to be able to do if you're taking like context, the one in the driveway, right?\nYeah.\nOkay, so but you're doing that locally on device, even that aspect?\nNo, the ground... sorry, the Grounding DINO would be ideally deployed in the cloud for the purposes of the demonstration, and just prototyping, I was having it run on my laptop, and without acceler... just running a CPU of a MacBook Pro M1, it was like 30 seconds for a 1080p frame.\nOkay, so the van has to be very stationary in order for this to work.\nYeah.\nOkay, right on.\nYou're not going to... you're not going to... you're not going to win any wars with that or something like that.\nNot, yeah.\nAnd then you replaced it with something faster, correct?\nThat's where you put the GPU on devices to do that.\nYeah, so by separating some of more of that compute and making it frontload the easier task on the drone, you can have a faster latency.\nYeah.\nOkay, that makes sense.\nThat's really cool.\nSo it's neat to see splitting the problem up, uh, where you we talk a lot about Edge, you know, and why it's useful on this and that, but here your your resource constraints kind of force you to be on the edge in this case, right?\nCorrect.\nLatency, the the context of which you're you're running this, right?\nThat's pretty cool.\nBut then, yeah, it's actually really interesting where right now the hardware that I'm running is pretty new, and like one of the orange series that are more expensive, but there are more more powerful chips that are just as more power efficient than newer generations that are able to run large vision transformer models on device.\nSo the constraint here was also cost.\nOkay.\nI'm funding this by myself, but if you were able to do this, they could feasibly run on the drones themselves with no cloud computer.\nHow much does the weigh the unit that you're using?\nUm, I'm not exactly sure, but weight is one thing.\nThe other thing you have to um contend with is power draw.\nSo every watt you use for compute is a watt you can't use for flying.\nOkay.\nAnd his B batteries are heavy, correct?\nYeah, yeah.\nOkay, okay, that makes sense.\nInteresting.\nCool.\nUm, so what are like just sort of backing up from the whole project, you had hardware, you had software, you had the LLM interactions, you had latency and dealing with splitting up the problem, and like uh, IoT low-level stuff, like what what were the biggest challenges that you contended with overall?\nYeah, so actually all the... with being these these technologies being newer and really well supported, especially on the forums, like I got to do a little shout out for my friends at Daily and Pip Cat.\nThey're they are very active in the community, and they're able to respond, and their libraries are like maintained constantly.\nSo if you have support needs, just go to them.\nAnd did you hack together with them over this past weekend?\nNo, I I have never... they built something for you?\nNever.\nYou never met them before this weekend?\nNo.\nSo they... I used Daily while I was at a previous company, and we had interacted with Quinl before.\nYeah.\nUm, but I think the most interaction I have is like GitHub issues.\nI would put up a GitHub issues, and magically, like a week or two weeks later, it'd just be fixed.\nYeah, yeah, cool.\nYeah, so uh, back to the original question of um, the different technologies I was using, the challenges of the challenges.\nSo software comes a little bit more naturally to me due to my background, but I think the hardest thing was iterating on hardware.\nSo building a project that's end to end from all the way from the front end all the way back to the to a flying machine, the hardware iteration time takes way longer.\nSo yeah, I'm not that familiar with Nvidia's stack, so it takes a long time to debug their firmware, rewrite new kernel drivers, stuff like that in order to get it to work the way you want it to work.\nYeah.\nAnd and you designed a unit, you had to design the drone itself to to take the payload and and this wasn't off-the-shelf unit, right?\nThe the AER, the aerodynamics or the the the flying properties of the whole you of the whole thing, you had to design that, right?\nI'm sure there were kits, but but very, very roughly, so this the the frame itself is off the shelf, and it comes with the motors and everything, but the main consideration you have to make because drones are well abstracted to the point at this point, okay, where the flight controllers are really able to compensate for changes in we and...\n\n\nAerodynamics, okay. So it's fairly easy for anyone to get started with the Hardware, okay? Inter. But in order to commercialize it, you need a deeper understanding. So sure, my drone flies well enough to carry a computer, that's about it. Yeah, got it and not fall on people, obviously. Okay, yeah, cool. Now, okay, so you've got voice control with the LLMs, you've got the onboard Hardware tracking, uh, going. You've got, did you handle things like in terms of like autonomously finding its destination? How did you approach that problem? Yeah, so there's a wealth of, um, APIs available on the internet, like Mapbox, Google Maps, that gives you location information. So like when you refer something like the nearest Trader Joe's or where can I, where can I pick up a rotisserie chicken for din? What about obstacles along the way? Obstacles in the sky, whatever that might be, or wind conditions, or like, are you dealing with some of that stuff? M. So the main AP, main things you have to deal with when you're building a flying object is the, the, uh, where you wanted to go, so that's your Maps, your weather, that's there's Google weather, there's a lot of weather APIs available, air traffic controls, their air map has a great API for that, and then the FAA. So getting information about power lines and and trees is, you're just flying high enough that you don't care, or do you deal with that? So my, I wasn't really focused on that because there's a lot of companies who have solved Real-Time AI object avoidance. My focus was to just fly as high as you can to avoid things, but low enough not to hit anything, so that you could play with the other aspects of the system overall, like the voice controller. Yeah, there's, there's still basic avoidance built in, but a lot of that system, they're available off the shelf. There's Library are like open source systems that you could actually use if you want to do. Yeah, yeah. So there's, um, the control library that most people use is called PX4. Um, it's, it has a lot of built-in functions that allow you to do a lot of visual neeral odometry, which is just localizing the drone, obstacle in safe landing zone finding, and you don't have to worry about that much. You plug and play and it works. Have you upsourced any part of the project that you've worked done or contributed back to some of these other systems? Uh, no, I have not. So I, I was trying to make some PRs for Pip Cat to give, give them a little hand up, but I think eventually maybe I'll open source some parts of it because I do want to encourage people to develop their own thing, but yeah, I don't think I've created anything particularly new that people should build off of. Okay, okay. Um, well, I mean, it's pretty novel to see a semi-autonomous, you know, drone that's voice controlled. I haven't seen that before. That seems novel. There are other voice control systems out there. Um, when I posted on LinkedIn, someone reached out and posted their open-source version of this that they've already done this before. Yeah, yeah. I think I'm just the first one to make a pretty video about it. Sure, yeah. I mean, you know, at the end of the day, these, what's great about some of these systems, they're not that hard to put the pieces. There's a lot there, but you know, there's so much you can build off of to make wonderful things. Did you, you might be too young, but did you ever, do you remember Taco Copter? Taco Copter? I've heard people talking about it. It's like a, some delivery. Yeah, I think it was a, it was a, it was a, um, this, this TR, um, star Simpson, she, like an MIT, uh, person, and she, she created like a great con concept of the names great and stuff like that. It kind of went viral for a bit, but the idea was just, I think it was back to day of like, um, Uber was, was just a thing and it was pretty big already, drones were there, but not really used in, and no one ever really talked about them for delivery, like Amazon, that was way. So it was like, you know, it was like, I'm going to build Taco Copter and I'll deliver tacos to you anywhere in the city. You know, actually, my, when I was applying to MIT in high school, the, the, I built a VL, like a vertical takeoff and landing wing that was super efficient, and I designed it specifically to deliver 20-piece chicken McNuggets because that was like the snack I would get after, after high school all the time. So the weight constraints and everything, it was designed to just deliver chicken McNuggets. Awesome, yeah, that's pretty cool. I mean, it seems like that stuff is coming technology-wise, but regulations are the, the harder part of that. Regulations are always lagging the technology, that's just how it is in the country. Well, there reminds me of you did have another video I saw with the, the fire scene of like checking out the fire and all that stuff, and like that, that's a place I think, my, my perception is, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but like drones are like all the drone startups that were there, they seem to have gone after that, that market because that's where like first responder scenarios are or wartime scenarios, those appear to be the two ones where there's, there's actually, they can get some, some traction, I guess. And yeah, so the main thing to, well, prove anything to the FAA or any government agency is miles flown, right? You want to demonstrate reliability and you want to demonstrate like efficacy. So I think the best way to go about that is what Zipline or what Paladin or other aerodrome, the DFR programs are doing. You're under a controlled and necessary scenario, you are deploying these drones acre a lot of miles experience technology, and then once you've reached a stage of maturity, then they will allow you to start delivering tacos to normal people. All right, so if somebody was wanted to get into like hacking drones and doing this kinds of stuff, where would they start, right? Uh, I really recommend there's a lot of great videos on YouTube teaching people how to make drones. Joshua Bardwell is a personal hero. RC test flight, all of us started because of people on YouTube building stuff. So cool, just watch YouTube videos, start building your own stuff, and I think Hardware is so affordable and accessible these days that you can just put any Raspberry Pi on a computer on a drone and it'll fly and do everything you wanted to. Yeah, super cool. Uh, what's your background like? How did you get into this? Sure. Uh, yeah, I, I've been flying drones since like Middle School. I started with a YouTube channel called Flight Test, and I saved up so much money to fly, fly their little foamy wings, and then from there I just started building on top of this and building more drones, getting them smarter. Then I worked at Paladin, which is one of the first DFR companies. They send drones to 911 calls, and I think a lot of the, um, industry experience comes from there. Yeah, makes sense. How many drones would you personally lost, lost? Um, I have a wall at home of all the corpses of drones that have crashed into things, especially when I got it started, cuz I built everything myself and the flight controllers were harder to use back then. Most of them never even made it off the ground. It was up and then straight down into the, oh, funny. So you really bu, building. Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. Um, and then to create Dispatcher, for like, how did the pro, where did the project get started? How was there, do you have a specific vision in mind for childlike things you wanted to build in that system? Yeah, so this is the example I used during the hackathon. But like, everyone wants to be Iron Man and you want like in Spider-Man or stuff, there's always like a drone or a pet bird, something people have always imagined having a flying personal assistant. So I just wanted to see that come into reality, and then I just want to build something that gets as close to that as possible. Yeah, awesome. Uh, what's your biggest wow moment that you had develop in this project? MH. Uh, I think it was finding Pip Cat, actually. I, I tried to build the entire, like a Pip Cat system all by myself, so it would ingest voice, parse it into an LLM, do function calling, all that, but then I realized that when I was trying to get the real time to work, like in order to be able to, the main thing was interrupt the the talking, sure, that's a huge thing that open AI, uh, well, Pip Cat was able to do. Yeah. Um, so once I picked up their Library, I was like, oh my goodness, this could go to another level. Have you looked at the open AI real-time voice APIs? I have. I have not. I'm very excited to try them. Yeah. Do you think it has, from what you've seen at least, uh, doesn't have the extensibility and the sort of hack ability to go and do tool calling in the right ways that you would need or to offload some of the processing like you're doing? You think it could be a drop in replacement for what you're doing or? I don't think it would be as simple because a lot of my framework is built around using Pip Cat as a message passing system, and while it can do function calling in order to like, um, integrate adding, because I don't know if the real-time voice API, I don't know if vision's already built into that, because I want it to maintain context of not only what it sees, but also what I'm telling it. Yeah, so makes sense. Yeah, cuz you, you gave it a mission and now it saw something and I want it to act based on the Miss. Yeah. I don't know if they quite, I don't know when this video comes out if it will still be true, but I don't think they've quite released that piece. It. Yeah, but I know that Pipe got you can stream, uh, frames of images, correct? And you're using that for the visual. MH. That's really cool. What the fra, like how many per, per minute or how many per second are you, um, it depends. So a lot of the answers to these would be like, it depends, right? So if you ask it to what it sees, it will tell you, but there's also other scenarios where you want it to continuously ingest images. Yeah, okay. And you kind of control that, but what's the max, like frame rate that you frame rate? I think that's completely limited by open AI. You can parallelize the frame call, so you have several agents. Yeah, but I think the maximum throw put you could probably do with one is one image per 3 seconds. Got it. Oh, because when you're getting down at the, the day, you using open AI at the provision model once you get correct. Yeah, yeah. So if I had more than trade on Pip Cat, no. Okay, no, got it. Open interesting. Yeah, yeah. Vision Transformer models are heavy. There's, that, that constraint will always be there. Yeah, yeah, that's pretty cool. How much does it in terms of tokens used, what does a flight cost for, for an hour? I, an entire hour. So the drone can go up to an hour. I don't think I've ever like pushed it that far. I think that the most a flight has ever cost, it's like five bucks. Yeah, but that was like really, really pushing it with as many images and parallel function calls and everything. Yeah, so there'll be a nickel by next year, whatever, but it's good to know. It gives you a sense of like how many tokens are be correct. Yeah, so it's still way cheaper than hiring a human pilot, of course, that's for sure. But if it, if it cost him more, there'd be no point. But you know, what else are you tinkering on? Like, what are your some of your other side projects? Uh, I think this might be the only one at the moment. I love a go-kart and play volleyball, but I think all my free time, the little that I have, is going towards this project. I mean, there's a lot there. I'm not surprised to hear that. It's a great project. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's been great to have you on. If this, um, if there's anything else you like to share? Yeah, oh, actually, one more thing. I'm do a little plug for myself. Yeah, this Dispatcher is just kind of a passion project right now, but I've been approached by a lot of people who say that it could be interesting and people want to use it.
