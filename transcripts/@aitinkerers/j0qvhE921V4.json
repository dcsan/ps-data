hood, a deep dive into the technology\nthat they built, why they built it, and\nhow you can apply it to your projects\ntoo.\nToday, we have from Neon Database, the\nfounder, Nikita Shamgunov.\nI think many people know MemSQL, I think\nNeon Database is also really successful.\nI think of Neon as like the GenAI-friendly,\nuh, serverless database.\nGreat.\nSo thanks for coming, excited to be here.\nTell us, what is Neon Database?\nSo Neon is serverless PostgreSQL.\nInitially, when we started the project, we\nlooked around and we recognized a number of\ntrends.\nThe most important one is PostgreSQL is\nwinning, and there's so many, so much\nevidence of that everywhere.\nThere's this website called DB Engine\nRanking, so if I go and pull it up here\non the web, I can start, um, you know,\ntaking out all the technologies down\nhere that are, you know, um, a lot smaller\nthan PostgreSQL.\nYou can see Snowflake rose up quite, quite\nwell, um, and this is a logarithmic scale.\nAnd now, if you look at basically the top\nfive, right?\nSo Oracle is still number one, MySQL\nnumber two, and SQL Server number three,\nbut the only one that is consistently\ngrowing is PostgreSQL, interesting, right?\nThe other, uh, place to take a look at\nthis is, uh, Stack Overflow survey.\nUm, now you can see in 2023, the number\nof professional developers choosing\nPostgreSQL for new applications is 49%,\nyeah, right?\nLet's replace it with 2024.\nNow, this link doesn't work, uh, but you\ncan click on databases here, you know,\ndatabases, and then the number of\nprofessional developers choosing PostgreSQL\nin '24 is close to 52%.\nSo now PostgreSQL has added several\npercentage points just in one year, that's\nawesome, uh, for new applications.\nAnd Snowflake isn't that bit of a red\nherring because it's really different\nkinds of, it's a different kind of\ndatabase, it is for analytics, yeah.\nIf you're building applications, if you're\nbuilding applications, no-brainer, it's\nthis, MySQL, SQL Server, and MongoDB,\nreally, sometimes SQLite, but it's more\nof an embedded data kind of associated.\nYou guys with the GenAI-friendly database,\nwhy, why do I do that?\nWhat are the things more concretely that\nyou do, right, that you would consider to\nbe right?\nUm, and so we started with thinking, how\ncan we empower developers?\nBecause at the end of the day, if you're\na database provider, the persona you're\nserving to, like, this is your God, your\nGod is a developer, right?\nSo you want to make them incredibly\nproductive, um, and incredibly kind of\nfluid, right?\nBecause every context switch for a\ndeveloper costs you something.\nSo we wanted to like catch developers in\nthe moment and enable them.\nThen it turned out, so if you over-optimize\nfor user experience and developer\nexperience, you actually do very, very\ngood for GenAI, because GenAI, um, agents\nare basically like, you know, artificial\ndevelopers, and whatever works for a human\nactually works for AI.\nNow, what, what is this exactly?\nWhat is this exactly?\nThe first thing is incredibly dense APIs,\nmhm.\nSo when you're generating code and you\nneed to consume whatever technology over\nan API, um, the counter example to that\nwould be something like AWS, right?\nWhen you go and spin up infrastructure on\nAWS, yeah, that would be, uh, you know,\nmultiple API calls, it's a high cognitive\nload.\nHigh cognitive load.\nIf it is a high cognitive load for a\nhuman, yeah, it's a high cognitive load\nfor AI as well.\nAnd the reason to that, that humans, um,\nyou know, even in the world where the\nagents are just as smart as humans or\nsmarter, which we're not quite there, but\nlooks like we're going to get there, um,\nthe amount of context that humans have is\nhuge.\nSo is the right way to think about Neon\nis open source PostgreSQL, but you've\ncreated this layer around at least part\nof what you've created, correct, to make\nthe administration, deployment, scaling,\netcetera, of that really super easy?\nSuper easy, right?\nAnd you can, I'll give you, I'll give you,\num, a tweet that I did, um, you know, the\nother day where, um, you can create, um,\na PostgreSQL database in just three lines\nof code, and I did this yesterday,\nactually, yes.\nSo I got Neon, I, I actually took my Dev\ndatabase and did like a table dump, and\nthen I had it running in Neon in the cloud\nand never having authenticated in less\nthan five minutes, correct?\nSo it definitely was, um, validated, and\nthe off step was like so seamless, I\nthought it was, I can, that I can\nactually show you, right?\nSo here's, you know, Neon CTL, is that is\nrunning on my laptop, um, I, you can\ninstall it, npm install Neon CTL.\nSo now you can say Neon CTL, right?\nAnd it just goes and connects you to your\nbrowser, you click authorize, and then\nyou're done.\nThank you for using Yen, y, uh, so now you\ncan go back, uh, and then you say nctl,\nit just says project, yeah.\nUm, and now you see how I'm provisioning\nnew databases for Dev and production and\ndo the branching, which we'll get into.\nUh, you say ne C projects list, and here\nare all the projects that that you have,\num, in, um, in y, and each project is a\ndatabase, right?\nThen you go here, you see all these\nprojects, the ones that are yours and the\nones that are shared with you.\nNow, instead of list, you say create, and\nthen see how fast this goes, right?\nDone, yeah.\nSo this thing returns you a PostgreSQL\nURL that you can plug in here, and now\nyou connect it to.\nSo, so making it super easy to make\ndatabases, you know, great.\nI have like one database, but I read\nsomething on your website that one of your\ncustomers has like a 100,000 or 200,000\ndatabases, like it's like they decided to\nspin up an entire database for each\ncustomer.\nIt's like a Lo.\nThis, this, this happens quite a bit.\nThat we were talking about Rol, which is,\nwhich is a great company, by the way, um,\nand then there's a product called Rol DB,\nyeah, uh, which creates, you know, a\ndatabase on demand for their users, right?\nSo, so again, I can see right away how\nlike that would create a little latency\nuser experience for each of those\ncustomers, because you're correct, able\nto, you know, because you never wait,\nright?\nIf you go on AWS, dat, yeah, takes 10\nminutes, right?\nAnd then here it, it, it comes back in a\nsecond.\nUm, and yes, that, so, so this is one use\ncase, like, if you are a death platform,\nwhatever death platform that might be,\nright?\nIt's interesting to think about, like,\nwhat you said, connecting that thought as\nlike an agent that actually decides, I'm\ngoing to go create a new database\ninstance and populate it and use it.\nIt's sort of the same way people are\nbuilding memory into memory packages for\nLLMs and things like this, right?\nWhy not build a datab DBA agent that,\ncorrect?\nBut OLTP, which is like online\ntransactional database, that use case does\nnot go away, but the amount of\nconsumption velocity of that consumption\nkind of correlates with the number of\napplications that are being created every\nday.\nAnd with agents now, we're, we're entering\nthe era of throwaway apps or instant apps.\nI can go, I can go on a product called\nVercel, right?\nAnd I can say, you know, create a, um,\nmortgage or calculator, sure.\nAnd this thing will go and, uh, create a\nmortgage calculator on demand, yeah.\nUm, now this is just JavaScript, um, and\nand see that now it's generating it, and\nthen it's going to start, um, sure, giving\nyou a UI preview, right?\nThat switch to the UI preview, and you\ncan see that it's like, it's coming out,\nright?\nIt's like in, um, you witness in a new\napplication being born, sure.\nUm, and then you can go and chat with it\nand say, okay, well, why, why don't you\nadd, you know, some tax calculations to\nit and tax savings and whatnot, but like,\nboom, like I just created a mortgage\ncalculator.\nMy wife can create a mortgage calculator,\nwho, who is a little bit technical, but\nnot really, she's not a personal\ndeveloper.\nAnd so you're saying with the knowledge\nthat I can go create provision databases,\nthen we can create persistence for these\napps too, correct?\nAnd it'll be just as, yeah.\nRIT already does it.\nSo I think one of the most exciting things\nthat happened in the agent world was first\nthe, the, the arrival of Devon, right?\nThis is a Devon software engineer, and\nthe whole world was like wild, and it's\nlike, oh, oh my God, this actually is\npossible, right?\nThat was more of a vision, um, and then,\nuh, Replit allows you to create small apps\non demand, sure.\nUh, and many times.\nSo the, the interesting observation is the\nmortgage calculator that I created on\ndemand has better user experience than\ngoing and Googling and trying to get a\nmortgage calculator on the internet,\nbecause, of course, when you go there,\nthey try to sell you mortgage rather than\ngive you a calculator.\nWell, okay, so if I was going to go\nprovision in a disposable software kind\nof way a database for my whatever, like,\nlet's say I, I have a business, small\nbusiness, and I've got like data\ndocuments, I'm like, great, agent, go\nslurping all the PDFs and know, by the\nway, index, I'm using this rag thing I\nheard about, and you know, it's going to\ngo off and use your tools, how quick is\nit to do that?\nIt depends how much you have, but like,\nhow fast is the database piece of that?\nIs it, um, you know, you're talking about\nrag, uh, often times, like I want to chat\nwith my PDF, and I want to do, uh,\nsemantic searches in, in, in my documents.\nTypically, you can go with the various\ndegree of fanciness here, and the most\nbasic way way is you're going to go chunk\nyour documents, um, you usually chunk your\ndocuments with a model as well, um, and\nnot just kind of blindly, you know, 8\nkilobyte chunks and whatnot, then you\nembed them, um, and then, uh, you need a\nvector store, so you need something,\nsomething that gives you what is called\nsimilarity search.\nI mean, you have PG Vector support, and\nyou're a core contributor to that project.\nSo, but do you bake in, do you wrap any\nof the work you just described, like I\ngot a chunk, I got to feed it, maybe you\nwant to do contextual chunking, like\nAnthropic just talked about?\nYes, you want to do, uh, things that are\nmore like data prep, not application.\nSo I would rather, as an application\ndeveloper, have that be abstracted.\nSo, so far, so far, so far, we just give\nyou PG Vector.\nWe are looking, so we, we've built on a\nhackathon in the month ago, a project\nthat we call PG Rag.\nUm, we are likely, we're still debating\nthat internally, is like, is this an hour\ncorner or is it in the kind of like\necosystem corner?\nUm, but there is a project that we built,\nuh, that's called Rag that that automates\na bunch of stuff, okay?\nThere's a, and imagine you putting those\ninto like cookbooks that people can\nreference, and cookbooks are already\nthere, there's tons of templates that\nexplain how to do that, and there are\nmany, many ways to do that, right?\nThere's LangChain, there's Llama Index,\nthere's, you know, tons of things.\nI, I, I think about, like, I mean, we\nhave to talk about Rag, even though it's\nso boring, yes, but, but it's just a\npopular use case and so important, and\nthere's still work to be done to make it,\nbut I was really excited, I don't know if\nyou saw contractural retrieval blog post\nthat Anthropic put out where they, they\ntalk about combining like keyword search\nwith embedding search and why putting\nthose together, and then they did some, I\nthink, data prep stuff on how do you, uh,\nembed your chunks with context, and they\nshowed in a kind of scientific, you know,\nmeasured, analytical approach that\nperformed much better than any other\napproach, right?\nRight.\nBut I, I can just imagine, like, as a\nuser of a data store, I want all of that\njust abstracted for me, so whether it's a\ncookbook or a future, I at least I'll be\nyour first customer.\nI think, I think maybe future looks the\nway you're Des.\nAs of today, the simple stuff is trivial,\nright?\nChunk the document, put it in the vector\nstore, take a cookbook, apply the\ncookbook.\nI'm like, you know, I can, I can go and\nand start applying those commands.\nYou know, create extension Vector, okay?\nUm, you know, go here, this is the\ndatabase we just created, uh, go here,\ncreate extension Vector, it works.\nUm, and then, you know, one by one, you go\nthrough cookbook, of course, you can like\nfollow, anybody can do that, mhm.\nThen, um, a query comes in, uh, you embed\nthe query itself, then go into the vector\nstore, pull out all the chunks of the\ndocuments that are relevant there by doing\na similarity search, take them, put them\nin the context window, ask a question to\nall them, so you do a little bit of\nprompting and you do a little bit of this\nvector embedding thing, and and that is\ntrivial.\nNow, from there, you're right, you want\nto, if you want to increase the quality,\na, you care about ranking, and so now you\nhave reranking models, two.\nNow you're realizing that certain\nreranking models should be trained on your\ndata in addition to just taking them all\noff the shelf.\nThe second thing they're realizing that,\nyes, well, keyword, keyword search is\nstill a thing, and then you kind of need\nto combine keyword search and, um, vector\nsearch.\nAnd the third thing that you realize that\nthere is a, a, um, call it a graph rag\nuse case, so I'm going to graph rag, um,\nR, Microsoft, Microsoft, uh, launched this\njust recently, mhm, uh, which is a, you\nknow, modular graph retrieval thing, and\nand so people who are increase the the\nquality, and that those are kind of\nadvanced companies now, such as like\nGlean, they all have graph semantics\nsearch in addition to this.\nNow, what you're asking is, well, that\nsounds complicated, right?\nIt's fun to tinker with, honestly, and I\nmean, part of me is like Devil's Advocate\nis like, what one is, I do want a product,\njust make it go away, I want to focus on\nmy app, maybe that wins out, actually,\nbut on the other hand, like, if I jump\ninto a product, then I'm locked into how\nthey've implemented it, and this stuff is\nchanging so fast, you know, with the\ncorrect keywords for, plus, you know, I\nmean, we're a year and a half into Rag,\nand there's already big improvements on\nquality based on these SE, and then you\nadd in graph, and you add in more, and\nmaybe the red purch is not a product, but\nit's like, I, I just the agent figures it\nout and evolves over time.\nIt could be, uh, well, typically, if you\nlook at the history of technology, first\nof all, you enable use cases, and then\nyou simplify consumption.\nAnd so even if you take, you know, my\nfavorite subjects, uh, relational\ndatabases, that's like a, you know, 40-year\nold industry or something like this, well,\nthe consumption in the beginning was\nreally hard, yeah, um, and then over time\nwe make it easier, easier, easier, but\nthe core foundation of the technology we\nfigured out years ago, so now we're\niterating on DevEx, we're iterating on\nsimplicity, uh, we're iterating on on\nlike making stuff done in seconds rather\nthan, you know, in the past days and hours\nand whatnot.\nLet's talk about branching, because that's\nsomething that blew my mind, and I've not\nheard of, I haven't been using databases\nforever, and, uh, you talk about an\ninstant branch of your database with every\npull request, you talk about, uh, you\nknow, uh, going back to any point in time\nor any second or minute, why would I need\nthat, and it sounds awesome?\nHow did you make that happen, and what are\npeople using that for?\nUm, my guess was like agentic workflows\nmight be doing destructive things to your\ndatabase, so why not quickly branch, work\nthere, get a result, and then roll back?\nYeah, you want breaths.\nSo, so like jumping straight to agentic,\nyou want breath, cr.\n\n\nUm, so, for example, um, well, today, most, what is a breadcrumb?\nUh, it means that you want to go to the previous state, whatever that state was.\nAnd the reason for that is, agent made destructive changes to your database.\nIt may drop tables.\nThe second, yeah, it may drop tables.\nIt can change data, whatever.\nUm, the second, uh, reason you're testing, yeah, so, and, um, if an agent produces some code, uh, the agent generates tests, just like a human, and you want to branch and run all the tests.\nAnd tests typically not just read, they read and write, so you don't want to apply rights into your production database.\nSure.\nFinally, you sometimes want to do things in parallel.\nM.\nSo, I think most of AI agents today are single-threaded.\nYeah.\nUm, and there was a tweet, uh, of Harrison Chase and, um, Michelle, um, Castanza, I think that's his last name.\nUh, he is a chief of AI, head of AI at Rep, and that's the guy behind Rep agent.\nAnd what they were talking about is, uh, most agents are single-threaded.\nThey do one step, and then they do another step, and then they do another step.\nYou can imagine the world that you do those things in parallel.\nSure.\nIf you, if you want to do those things in parallel, you know, you want to fork your state, because, um, agents operate on the state, and database is that state, and potentially your files or file system or S3 state, those are all your states.\nAnd if you want to explore anything, um, like one of the best things that you can do as an agent is to build the same feature 10 times.\nYeah, and then choose the one that is, that is better.\nUh, and of course, you're bumping into inference cost, you're bumping into the infrastructure cost, and you're bumping into just the time to do that.\nAnd I think all of those things are going to be solved.\nFirst, the inference cost is, is, is rapidly, uh, depreciating by, I think, like 30 times, 30-5x a year or something like this.\nIt's incredible.\nUm, you know, Neon already allows you to fork the database state.\nWe don't do it for the file system state, for the database taste, we can do it.\nUm, what's a concrete example of where branching is necessary for an agent system?\nLike, what would be a use case where it's like super powerful?\nFirst of all, is that parallel Monte Carlo research?\nOkay.\nAnd what, what's the scenario where if you didn't have that, it would break or it'd be a problem?\nOh, it wouldn't break, it would just take a lot longer.\nSo, because you do things in parallel, right?\nBut you could do things in parallel without branch and just use the same data set.\nWhy, why not?\nWell, but if you change the data set, right?\nAnd, and then each implementation of, of what you're trying to do in, start from the, I guess I'm thinking of the scenario I'm thinking of as multi-agent, where they act sort of like humans in different roles, and I'm thinking about like factory, factory production, where the manager agent is overseeing, and maybe they intervene, in which case you'd want the data to be changing.\nOkay, yeah, so we are talking about two different things.\nI'm talking about an AI agent, a software agent that is building software, um, and if a piece of software is built, you know, and always, every piece of software almost needs a database, and if you build the next feature to that piece of software as in AI, what it's called, s agent or software agent, then you want to fork the state and then kind of explore the state, because we, in this particular case, an AI agent is a software developer.\nOh, you're just saying, okay, you, you software development agent that wants to try a bunch of scenarios, you want to do them in parallel on your data, that, that is, that, that's basically just copying your database, so that they are running independently.\nI get it.\nCorrect.\nOkay, that's so that that scenario makes sense, right?\nAre people doing that to create a systems that'll create better, I guess they must be when you're people exploring this disposable software.\nI guess there's low code, no code, and there's autonomous something, and in that space to offer better results to customers, you, you want to do things in parallel.\nI mean, the dream scenario is like, I spec it, and tomorrow morning I have five versions of the product.\nI just, and at least the promise of this is Neon from Cognition Labs.\nSo you spec it, um, um, of course, there, there should be accuracy in the spec, um, and then if there are inaccuracies, they will go that the agent will go and clarify with you and ask questions, and then, this doesn't happen with humans, because it's too slow and expensive, but if you give me a, there's two cases of a, of a vague spec.\nOne is like, stop and wait for the PM to get back to you.\nThe other is like, let's invent 10 versions that will, one of them is probably the right inter, that's better.\nIn in the world where, um, uh, you're working with a human, a human will either have to make assumptions, yeah, um, or interact with a PM, yeah.\nIn the world of AI Agents, you can make many assumptions in parallel, and then you build it, and then you, you choose it.\nSo, one observation that I make that when you build software today, one person is, it's always pair, a pair, right?\nOne person is writing the code, the other person is reviewing the code.\nYeah.\nAnd I think as we switch into the agentic world, we're going to be in the situation where one person is writing the code, and that person could be an agent, and a human is reviewing the app, yeah, not the code.\nAnd there should be a feedback mechanism between reviewing the app and then feeding that information back into the agent.\nIf you look at where the death platforms are heading, um, and I'm speaking, I'm talking about Vercel specifically, um, and I think Netlify might, might have this feature as well, but we're working much closer with Vercel, they have this notion of previews, yeah, that every pull request that you send generates a full version of the app, the whole preview, um, and then you can go on, um, um, consume it, it has a Vercel toolbar, it allows you to comment on the say, all that information go straight back into the agent.\nYeah, way.\nSo you could, you could ship faster and test broken stuff.\nPoint and say fix, you remove risk, you remove risk, um, and, and, and that's the, I think that there going to be that, if you didn't, if you're not using this branching thing, like what a pain it takes me, I think seven minutes to restore a full backup of my database right now.\nCorrect.\nYou know, I'm not going to spin up 10 of those every time.\nLet me just show you, right?\nUm, let me just show you how do, but, but how does it work?\nIs that a native feature of PostgreSQL or something?\nThat's not a native feat.\nYou built in.\nWe, we built it.\nLet me explain how.\nLet me show this feature, right?\nOkay, so I'm going to go here, uh, on this equal letter, and then I say, you know, create table T, ID int.\nIt's just like the most basic table.\nUm, and then I'm going to say insert into T values, values 1, 2, 3, right?\nSo, um, I added a few, um, um, and, and now I can go into the tables view, and I see, you know, a couple instances of 1, 2, 3.\nThen I can go to branches, and I say I want to have a new branch, uh, I'm going to call this branch AI Tinkerers, uh, right?\nAnd when I created this new branch, which happens instantly, yep, and it happens instantly when the database is small, and it happens instantly when database is large, aming.\nAnd then I, I'll explain why.\nSo now I can switch between Main, and I can say instantly, and I can go operate on the new branch independently as well.\nSo I don't believe you.\nIt's a sandbox.\nYes.\nUh, so, so I go from Main, I can go in AI Tinkerers, and now the is the same.\nOkay, so some, some databases out there, they say, oh, we have branching, but all they do is create a new database and copy the schema.\nYeah, of course, that's the, that's easy, the easy approach, but, well, how, here's how this works.\nIs this a secret you're never going to reveal?\nLike, oh, the code's open source.\nOh, even for this, even for this?\nOh, wow, the code's open source under, under the Apache license, so there, there are no secrets, there's just engineering.\nOh, that's amazing.\nAnd, and here, if you click on architecture, um, architecture, uh, Neon architecture, yeah, there is the simple architecture diagram, um, with a lot of engineering behind it.\nSo here you have PostgreSQL, and this is storage.\nSo that's for a second think, um, assume that this storage looks more like, um, you know, a Colossus file system, just a gigantic file system.\nIt, it's not really, because the API to the file, to that, to the storage subsystem is different.\nThat API is very PostgreSQL-centric, yeah, but what it really is, it's, it's, it's a storage system that is built, it's swans shared system that's built for the whole fleet of PostgreSQL instances.\nAnd we run close to this part of PostgreSQL already.\nIs this an innovation you, this innovation we've done?\nWe built it from scratch.\nWe built it in Rust.\nAnd then, and you're very, you're compatible with whatever low-level PostgreSQL APIs are there.\nCorrect.\nAnd low-level PostgreSQL APIs are, you know, there's this thing disc called wall, write-ahead log, and it allows to ingest the wall, and then there's another API that allows us to fetch pages.\nSo, um, so it, it, it talks to PostgreSQL by in a very, like me, an 8 KB.\nNow, what, when you say I want to create a branch, we go to this the storage subsystem and say, hey, um, create an, create a branch, and it like moves a bunch of pointers inside of it and uses what is called copy-on-write.\nSo the actual physical pages that represent that, that state for the database are not duplicated.\nGot it.\nSo, but some pages know that they participate in this database and in that database.\nGot it.\nUm, and then what, what copy-on-write is, and that's why it's so fast, the database could be a terabyte, could be 10 terabytes, the, the branch will be created instantly, because it's just a little bit of metadata.\nSure.\nUm, everything is also integrated with the object store, and I think object stores are so good these days that every single database, um, or data infrastructure will be built on the object store, um, over time.\nAnd now it's like this is the time to do it for, for operational databases as well.\nYou still need a low latency tier that sits on top, but it's like a, a big part of speaking, storing data.\nDo you have anything interfacing with or used with Edge clouds or to getting your data closer to where people are, and how does that work?\nI know what, when I signed up, like I've chose one location that was closest to my app, but do you have something more?\nThat is actually quite a hard problem, um, that is quite a hard problem.\nUm, we do things a little bit better for you, um, and I'll show you.\nThere's this thing called Neon, uh, serverless driver.\nOkay, serverless npm, so it's downloaded about, you know, 200, close to 200, um, um, downloads a week.\nWhat that allows you to do is, if you are in in any Edge location, which could be a browser, uh, which could be, um, you know, a Cloudflare worker, it could be, you know, a Vercel function, um, you can go and make an HTTP request into the database and get the results back.\nNow, um, databases are kind of stuck in the past, they require you to have a stateful TCP connection to them.\nYeah.\nAnd what stateful means is like all the temp tables on the transaction context, all of this, and databases are transactional, you need to tell, you know, change some data, commit or roll back.\nUm, now developers today, they, they like to live in the world of of TypeScript or JavaScript, um, and so that maps very, very nicely, and you can make it HTTP request.\nSure.\nBelieve it or not, that databases of the past assumed that the application sits closer to the database, yeah, and therefore, um, if you have a chatty protocol, um, it almost doesn't matter, because the cost of the transaction is, is not very high compar, and, and, uh, it's kind of much higher than the cost of the network round trips when you sit right next to it.\nYeah, and that is actually true if you sit right next to it, but it's not longer the case.\nSure.\nUh, and so now the cost of each round trip could me, could be much higher.\nSo, so this is what we do for, for Edge functions and serverless functions, plus we can store create read replicas, and we very friendly with all the caches like Cloudflare hyperdrive and whatnot.\nUm, um, and the popularity of this thing shows both that the performance gains that you can have, um, and then, um, the, the convenience, right?\nThe other thing that is kind of cool is this allows us to to bring more and more functionality in this serverless driver, and the next one that's coming is is called authorized.\nUm, you can go here, um, to, um, you know, let's take this project called Azure, by the way, Azure launched, uh, today, at the time of the recording of the recording.\nUm, now we can, we can spin up databases in Azure.\nSo awesome.\nUh, there's this authorized page, which right now only visible to me, so only visible to Neon employees, and then you can go and add an authentication provider.\nM.\nUm, and now if you're building an app, and if you're building an app, uh, that has Oauth, and you use, let's just say you use Clerk, because developers, you know, that's like the, the Oauth of awesome company for for a today.\nUm, a zero is like an awesome company of slightly yesterday, um, and then Azure AD, for example, now that we have Azure, we integrate with Azure Active Directory, but each of them, all they do is when you authenticate, when you click on this button, call authenticate with Google, uh, or something, or Apple, or GitHub, whatever, what they send you is, uh, what is called JWT token, yeah, and then you can go and connect those things together.\nUm, I can need to like log into Clerk, and so you're making that world play nice with the base world with this product.\nThis is not launched yet, this is launching at the end of the month.\nThis is going to launch in the end of, so this is, we'll announce this video when this is ready to talk about.\nCorrect.\nUm, and that is really interesting, because you see this evolution in how software is created, where it's composable and disposable.\nCorrect.\nAnd it's composable, allowing you're going to go from spec to implementation, but still use rock-solid components in the background, versus today, the disposable suffers a, a joke, right now.\nIt's a, it's funny little JavaScript app, but it's not real.\nBut with these, it could be.\nYes.\nAnd, and, and then like, you don't need to do with Neon, for example, you don't need to make that we tradeoff that it's either good for developers or it's like robust and great infrastructure.\nNow it's both.\nSo, for example, if you, if you think about Heroku, right?\nHeroku, um, was a pioneer of developer experience, by the way, a bunch of people from Heroku went to GitHub and made GitHub great, um, and then they, they continue, you know, innovating in that journey.\nWe have some people from GitHub as well.\nBut that was that trade off, like it's nice, it's convenient, but it only scales up to a point, and from that point, you need to, you need to eject, you need, you need to graduate.\nIf you grow out of, if you grew out of Heroku, you had a good problem to have, way, but it's, yeah, but it's still a problem.\nAnd then you go and invest, and you build a DevOps team, and you go on AWS.\nWell, people complain now about serverless as a whole generation of developers that, let's call it, they don't have the bare metal experience of building servers and architectures, and they're getting into it with whatever how they get into it, and they, it's great, and they use serverless, and then you see the tweets that are like, oh my God, I have $2,000 bill, what do I do?\nI'm begging for help here publicly, right?\nRight.\nWith is that a fundamental problem with this architecture?\nWhy it's not, uh,\n\n\nAnd and the reason to that is, it could be, you know, with Neon, it's not quite yet, but we're in a journey. Uh, but it could be, uh, it could be strictly better. And what makes it strictly better is that if you think about, you know, how we charge, for example, we charge on this thing called compute unit, which corresponds to one CPU and 4 GB of RAM. Yeah. Um, and well, feedback, I had a trouble understanding that myself. You know, I'm like, I, I run a PostgreSQL database in a cloud. I rent the server. It's a fixed cost per month. Every once in a while, I want more speed or RAM or whatever because I grow my data set, and I just click a button. I upgrade. That's how I do it. It's pretty old school, right? When I go to your thing, I'm like, oh, this is interesting. My questions are sort of fundamentally like, if I move my workloads over, will it be faster or slower? I think maybe faster, these guys, and they auto-scale. That'll probably be useful. How useful? But then on the pricing, you know, the tier one paid plan is like half the months of hours. Like, are you counting hours when a query runs, or is it me saying the machine's live, right? My machine's live 24/7. Uh, machines live, but the size of that machine is dynamic. Okay. And so I need a, I need a plan because I have a database that runs 24/7 all month. Correct. I need a plan that has at least those hours, right? Um, but is that how to think about it? Way to think about it, like when you go on Amazon and you say, and you choose that size, and it's a manual operation, um, that gives you, um, the cost of your database is, you know, a fixed line that goes like this. And basically, it's like the, the, the this, um, sure, uh, that whether you use it or not, use it, you know, you provision it for, right? And then, uh, for Neon is going to be the area under the curve, and the S, the height of each curve is how much database you need to have each second. If I'm scaling up that moment, if you're scaling up in that moment, and we're listening to all the telemetry that's coming into the, this, this computer instance that is right here. Do you have a tool to help me predict what that cost might be before I use it? Tell, we, we can tell. Can I give my, can I export my SQL logs to you and just you tell me? Today, it's hard to do it ahead of time, but we give you all the historical data. Got it. So, so now you can go back and see how many compute units you had on a per second basis. Um, and actually the price is very, very competitive with, with Amazon. So if you just say, okay, I don't want to change my compute size at all, right? I'm just going to have fixed compute, this will match your RDS. I mean, given how lightweight it was, and like I told up, and I actually got a database table running in it in the cloud, like in five minutes, I was like, okay, the next step for me would be just, it's so ephemeral, why not just do it, load my eight gigs in there, swap my app over for a while and run it and see how the per, you can, you can do. I don't like it. I just expose the whole thing. Correct. But if I'm better off, I'm better off. That's right. Yeah. And PostgreSQL, well, that's the beauty of it. PostgreSQL migrates very, very easily. Yes, of course. And if you, if you have an RDS instance, you can move it. We actually, and my calculus is so short term around the price and performance, when I know in my heart, if I'm successful, I need to be here. I need the management core. I don't want to hire. How much do the DBA cost? Well, it's just $200,000 a year, right? I mean, unless you outsource this thing somewhere else, but you would rather outsource it to a Dev tool because, well, tooling is, is less expensive or s to some sort of an agent. So talk more about auto-scaling for a minute. Like, how quickly does it spike? Does it scale up like I do, you know, ERS? We do events, or we do like, let's say, you know, you got a ton of people signing up all at once in an hour. Okay. In a few seconds, it would actually accommodate an incremental load. Correct. Wow, okay. So it, it happens really, really quickly. We actually scale up much faster, and that's because you separated this data store architecture from the, the only reason to deliver on serverless is to separate storage and compute, because that's what makes PostgreSQL itself in a way stateless. Okay. And when it makes it stateless, we can change the size of the VM dynamically. Now, there's still a lot of system engineering that goes into like, hey, I thought I had this much memory, but now I have this much memory. Um, so, so, so PostgreSQL needs to be, uh, ready and not crash when this happens. And so it required some changes, and, and you know, we can go into like the Long Systems Rabbit Hole of how that's done, but does make sense. So if, if I'm using PostgreSQL on my own or through, I imagine many cloud things that don't have this architecture, then I'm not going to get those kind of, what are, but you mentioned Aurora earlier when we were talking as you started as sort of like an open source or alternative to. Yeah, and it's evolved from there. Like in what, so they do, they fundamentally have a similar like separation of storage and computer? Different. I think, I think that was, um, and again, they're not even the first one to, to create it, but they, they were the first one who did it for OLAP, uh, in the cloud, right? The, the previous technology that had that architecture is actually Oracle Rack. Got it. So we're basically recycling lots and lots of ideas, but we're, we're building it for the modern conr. Is Snowflake fundamentally on the hood something like that, too? That's how they just for analytics, just for analytics. So, so, uh, for Snowflake, you don't need to have super low latency storage because that's needs for, for applications and transactional workloads. But fundamentally, sake stores data on the object store, and, and when my earlier comment that everything is coming to the object store, okay, this is actually true. All right, let's do some rapid fire more style questions. So you've raised how much money this company? It's 132 million. 132 million, just a little of a chunk chain. And you're the CEO and founder. Correct. Deep database background, obviously very technical. It's great. You probably shouldn't be tinkering, but what are you tinkering on right now? What are your site projects? Um, my site projects are, um, all agentic right now. Yeah. So I'm, I'm tinkering with, with sweet agents. Okay. Um, I'm tinkering with, um, uh, with, with like, you know, I have access to Devon, um, so I'm like playing with Devon. Sure. Um, I think if you're building an agent system on your own, are you doing it off the cuff or using the Frameworks that are there? There's, yeah, lots of Frameworks. So yeah, lots of Frameworks now. And, and like, Lan chain and and llama index and all those, you using any of those, or you just doing? I'm, I'm using Lan chain. You're okay. Yes. And, and so, um, but the, the, the lens that I'm looking at all that is is all SWE agents. I think SWE agents is, um, absolutely the future, and we approaching. Define it, lay it out. What do you mean by that? Sweet agents. Sweet, swe, swe agents, sorry. SWE means SWE. Um, I think people mostly call them SWE. Yeah. Um, anyway, software, it says software agent, right? But like, look, look at all the angles that we're approaching the, the job of accelerating software development. Is your angle just playing and it's fun? It's play tinkering, or are you trying to do something that you could use in your company, or are you, you're approach like looking at the benchmark and see if you could be there? What, what is your angle? So I'm just, CU, so, so I think that, um, um, I'm a firm believer that that software agents will change the way we build software, and when this happens, the whole infrastructure underneath will have to adapt. Sure, or change, or new ones will, uh, new pieces of infrastructure will be created. So when it comes down to new pieces of infrastructure, we already know that we need evals, and we need eval stores, and therefore companies like, uh, Brain Trust data and and LlamaSmith and all those things, it's just like system of record for evals. Yeah, we can, we need to track evals, we need to generate DS as well. Yeah. So there, there are tools now that, um, can come to your codebase, and you obviously, like as an owner of the codebase, um, I wonder, are wondering, right, um, is this agent going to work on my codebase? Yeah. So for that, you need to generate a bunch of evals on your codebase, and there are tools now that can help you with that. As the agent goes and start crunching, um, you know, there's a certain amount of context window, um, you know, size, uh, which keeps increasing, but like still, still in the hundreds of thousands right now for Anthropic for Claude, and Claude is the best LM for agents right now, which may change any moment. Y. Um, then, uh, you need a memory tier. Y. So you need a memory tier. So that, that is a new piece of infrastructure, and I'm, and I'm kind of like playing with companies like Mzero and Letter, uh, seeing what, what, what they're up. So that seems more like an LP use case. The, the idea there is like, you, Mzero is the Palala AI Tinker organizer. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I, well, the idea there is you can tell LLM that they can, that that an LLM itself can offload certain, certain information into the memory and request that on demand as well. Yeah, which is kind of cool. I can imagine. That's interesting if you're a database guy to look at that future, and it's going to a lot of work, but all of that is infrastructure. When, when I think about code interpreting, right, this, so you had E2B on your podcast recently, and then Perplexity is using them. Um, then when you, uh, when you just do function calling, then this is next gen infrastructure. Sure. Can you use AWS Lambda for this? Yes. Is it custom built for that use case? No, it existed 10 years before any of this stuff, right? Right, right. Can you use Dev containers for that? Yes. Some people do, but like some, like there's new requirements that coming in. So I think this whole infrastructure pyramid, starting from storage, compute, database, and then high level in infrastructure, and some of that infrastructure I want to bring into the Neon platform. Okay. Just like I brought in Auth, right? Just like we will bring API data API into the platform, we may bring mem tinkering, because you know, there's some extremely interesting value there that could be part of your. Yeah, yeah. What are the today use cases you see on top of your platform that are GenAI or maybe even SWE that are like, I unasked two questions. One is like the boring high scale use cases. I always like people are tinkering, but what is really taking off in your opinion that maybe boring in high scale? And then what, and then the second question will be, what's the most exciting, outlandish, crazy, but it might work use? Yeah. So the first use case, uh, that, that, that came in, uh, was extremely boring. I need the PostgreSQL database. What's it, what is the simplest thing in the world that can give me a PostgreSQL database? Just data from my GenAI app. Simple, not even GenAI app. Oh, just any app. I need a database, right? People need PostgreSQL database. Specifically, what, what are they using your GenAI friendly cloudless, cloud serverless database for? In GenAI world, in the GenAI world, uh, well, hold that thought for a second. Let me, let me give you the whole progression first. The first one was like, I just want a database, and I want a database that if I spin up, does not cost me anything, um, if I don't use it. So that's where the serverless PostgreSQL comes in. The second use case came in as a function of the first one, which is I happen to have a lot of databases. Yeah. Either I'm a Dev platform like Retool, or I'm creating a database pendant and many customers. I need to have some sort of, you know, um, boundaries around, around each one of their data stores. Um, lots of reasons for that. So it's called database prenant. So, so now they're, we, we have Dev platforms using Neon, but we also have companies that, that they end up up, uh, using one database per tenant. Makes sense. Um, then, uh, you know, the GenAI first January use case came in. It's like, I need a RAG. So the whole industry was, was obsessed about building RAGs. Now you're saying, well, RAGs are boring, right? How long has it been? Less than a year, right? They're not going away. They're not going, actually, pretty exciting improvements all the time, but, but they're kind of like figured out, right? Yeah. Then the next use case came in is like, okay, I'm generating an app. I need to host it somewhere, and all the infrastructure is fairly easy, except for the database. Yeah, right? And so, um, and then if I'm generating lots and lots of apps, that serverless piece and and the cost optimization comes very handy, because some of the apps that throw away, you don't want to pay fixed cost for each database that you create, because that adds up very, very quickly. Today, we're launching close like 6,000 databases per day. So now imagine that is, um, you know, the cheapest database on, on AWS, like 10 bucks a month, like doesn't sound like a lot. Yeah, multiply by 6,000. 6,000 a day, uh, incremental. Sure. Incremental. Yeah, multiply them by a month, um, and it's a fairly sticky thing, your database. Well, the new world of Ages, it may not be, but traditionally it is. Traditionally is, right? And and if the database works, people doesn't like, don't like to swap it. If it doesn't work, they get livid, right? They, they just like very, very frustrated. Um, and, and that's where, where, um, you know, the foundation of like database is scary. There's character encoding things and different indexes and things. Like PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL is easy. So once you commit to PostgreSQL, um, I think, I think switching providers is okay. Um, okay. So what are some of most exciting, interesting customer use cases you've seen or Tinkers that are building on your platform? What are the apps you've seen that inspire? I think, I think Retool agent is probably still the most exciting thing that, that we have. Um, there's a company called Wordware, the, the hottest company in the Y Combinator B that is using that is using Yen right now. And then I'm excited to add Auth, uh, which is, you know, now in 30 days or so, we, um, we simplify the, the, the work for, for agents, and we simplify the work for, for humans, and and we're going to have more and more software agents choosing. How did you first hear about AI Tinkerers? I got invited. That was not Fredman and Alex. Oh, yeah. Um, Al, Gely, Gly. Yeah, yeah. Say they organized one in San Francisco, so I came in. I showcase our Vector implementation at that time. PG Vector was not good, uh, meaning it, it used an outdated, uh, algorithm for similarity search, um, and we saw this as an opportunity. We built, you know, a modern, what is called HNSW implementation, showcase that people love it. This thing to cough two months later, PG Vector added HNSW, and we decided is that it's much better for us and for the community to start contributing. Y. And, and we took all the learnings that we, we had from PGM betting, such as paral index build, we, we, we brought them into PG Vector. So that was my first exposure to it. CS, I came to the Seattle one once. Yeah, I was in town. Uh, so that was cool. Yeah, I was one of the. Um, I think we come, we, we're ready, especially after the 30th to to show a few more, uh, so I'd be excited to come either in Seattle or in. Yeah, it'd be fun. We could do, um, and obviously you were a sponsor of our hack fund. We just had. Thank you very much. That was amazing.\n\n\nAnd people did use your product, so it was a success.\n\nUm, so where could people check out the product?\nObviously, neon.tech, and there's tons of cookbooks, and like I said, you can get started in five minutes if you just want to kick the tires.\nCorrect?\nYeah, pretty cool.\nYeah.\nUm, I, I think that's the best.\nUm, I think you can also consume it via, via Retool.\nYou can also consume it via, you can consume it via Retool.\nNow, oh yeah, your, your audience probably doesn't use Retool, um, because you might already be using Neon and not know it.\nYou, you might be, yeah, if you use Repl, Retool yourself, yeah.\nOkay, well, thanks Nikita Shamgunov for coming on and uh, having this conversation and showing us under the hood.\nThank you for all the questions.\nThank you.\n\n[Music]\n",
