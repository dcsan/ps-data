  "cleanText": "So, what we did was, uh, we developed this technology that allows to take the 2 billion parameter model, select a set of capabilities, benchmarks, or like, \"Hey, this is the one query I care about,\" and then shrink it down to size.\n\n[Music]\n\nHello, AI Tinkerers, and welcome to another edition of AI Tinkerers.\nThis is where we meet the leaders and innovators in the community who are really pushing the frontiers in some way, and we go under the hood with them, really kick the tires a bit, and show how to use their technology and a little bit about how they might have built it so that we can enable a fellow Tinker in their projects.\nToday, I'm super excited.\nWe're here with Vik from Moondream.\nVik, thank you for thanks for coming.\nHey Joe, super excited to be here.\nUm, tell everyone what Moondream is.\nYeah, um, we're focused on building a computer vision that works for developers where they want to run it, whether it's in the cloud, on their on their phones, on their laptops, or even on edge devices like your Raspberry Pis and RG know and whatnot.\nTalk about the edge device piece because running a vision model is is uh, you've got a you've got a couple flavors, and one is like pretty really small.\nThey're both small.\nM, tell us more.\nYeah, um, traditional computer vision algorithms uh, tended to be really small and focused on edge deployment, um, but the problem with them was they were narrow.\nSo you had to deploy a model for object detection and another one for segmentation, etc.\nUm, and they were also hard for developers to get into without having a background in machine learning because usually your first step in training an object detection model is to get a bunch of training data and figure out how to MH train it.\nUm, Vision language models came along and made the developer experience a lot easier, uh, because now, rather than having to train models, you can just prompt them, and they, for the most part, work.\nIt's it's the same thing that happened in text where you used to train classifiers, and it would give you a very narrow classification for one problem.\nNow you can prompt general purpose for anything.\nVisions follow that same path.\nIn fact, the corer course that I took, uh, five or six years ago, was the first thing, the first ML model you did do was to train a vision Rec as a, you know, classifier, dogs versus cats, and you gathered the data by basically running a Google image search, you know, yep.\nAnd but it was a good instruction on sort of like old school ML pipelines, cross validations, all this, um, but I would never do that myself in an application because I can use Moondream and and get one shot incredible results without doing any work.\nUm, so that's kind of okay, so that's Moondream.\nUm, when did you start working on it?\nUh, uh, almost exactly a year ago.\nOkay, I thought more than that because I I remember meeting you at a Tinker.\nOur first release was December.\nOkay, uh, December 29th, if I'm not mistaken, last year.\nSo I might have been working on it before that at the first time we met, but we hadn't shipped yet, cuz it was back when we were we did our very first hackathon in 2023.\nIt was in the summer, I think.\nI remember remember uh, someone mentioning you as tinkering on this like thing, and you're still at Amazon, I think.\nYeah, I I don't know if I was.\nThe years are a little messed up in my brain.\nI don't think I was working on this summer 2023.\nI was doing other stuff, messing around with language models and stuff.\nInteresting.\nOkay, cool.\nWell, it's really it's super cool.\nUm, it's really fun.\nUm, do you want to show let's show people what it does?\nLike, let's let's go and dive in.\nUm, yeah, so this is a Moondream playground.\nWe um, just have this online for people to play own with the model, um, and you're completely like open open weights.\nI could go download and deploy this on my own, you know, device.\nYou can everything we're showing, you can download and you're running.\nYou've got a playground.\nIs this for just demo purposes, or are you running?\nYou're not running an inference service for people to actually like build apps on top of, or are you?\nWe do that as well, not to make money off of it, just to make that like when you're getting started, you don't want to figure out how to run inference locally, so just for that purpose.\nIf you were like, \"I want to scale to gajillions,\" you could go to there are providers who have deployed Moondream.\nMH, replicate.\nOkay, I know I've used it.\nThere there's replicate, there's F, there's a couple of others, um, but yeah, they're available.\nUm, we're also happy to talk to you.\nYou got yeah, sure, an industrial use case, you could do that.\nCould you show us like's uh, yeah, so we have a couple of different capabilities in Moondream.\nUh, I'm going to show off visual question answering first, call a VQA.\nUm, you can just ask general purpose questions about images.\nUm, one of the things that's really important for developers is structured outputs, uh, so you can do, um, what is the girl's hair color, eye color, and what is she saying?\nOh, I have not tried this prompt, so we'll see.\nCool.\nOh, no, it's fast.\nYeah, Moondream spotted.\nYeah, I got it.\nPurple, blue.\nThat's really cool.\nUm, you've got a couple of other capabilities too, like if you look at pointing, for example, yeah, um, in a lot of cases, you want to localize uh, where objects are in the image or you're pointing at text, and it it spotted it in two places.\nThat's cool.\nAnd then I shows up here.\nOkay, um, yeah, we've got generalus capturing object detection, but yeah, that's I don't know if you noticed, but I wore this today because I thought it would be challenging.\nIt's camouflage, and you can't see it.\nSo we have to test the model out.\nYeah, um, okay, so you've got a few different modes, like can you show us like okay, so there's VQA, which is visual understanding, captioning, which we know what that means, I guess, um, object detection.\nYou should just pointing at objects.\nObject detection is detection is going to be similar.\nSo if you do next, and you're returning like XY width, height, or something, and array, an array of them, MH, how many, like, at what point does this break?\nLike, you know, if I take a picture of like Times Square, New York, with like tons of images and pictures, and I say, \"Give me all the Bounty boxes of all the text that you see.\"\nOne of the flaws in our object detection right now is if there are objects that are tightly grouped together and that sort of thing, it just draws one box around the whole group.\nOkay, um, so it kind of works, but usually not what people are looking for.\nGot it.\nBut you could use you could write a little bit of logic to like iteratively get y.\nYou probably want to crop it into smaller bits so that the model can.\nOkay, very than it's very fast.\nI mean, that's obviously, I guess, a function of being a small model.\nDid we are we seeing the two billion model or the this is the two billion parameter version of the model.\nUm, with our latest release, by the way, I I just ran this Benchmark a couple of minutes ago.\nUh, we've optimized inference code.\nMhm, so with this, this is running on a 3090.\nEach image takes about 150 milliseconds to um, to process, and then once you start generating tokens, you get 128 tokens per second or so.\nIt's running at P16.\nSo show us um, fast on the visual.\nThe VQA is pretty new, right?\nBecause I mean, they go to captioning and say, like, um, like, how old do you think the girl is, and what is what is she wearing?\nYeah, captioning doesn't give you a lot of controls.\nIt just like generates.\nIt's literally no prompt.\nOkay, yeah, a lot of people were using it for this.\nThey were like, \"What prompt should I use?\"\nSo we just put it in so that people don't have to worry about it.\nYou can pass a prompt to it though, right, in the API?\nWe the API that you pass a prompt to, we call query.\nUh, it's VQA here.\nVQA, okay.\nOkay, so you basically segmented out like a a a simple captioning and no no parameter, basically, right?\nYeah, but I can type the prompt in here.\nIt was like, \"How old is the goal and what else, what kind of, what is the purpose of those clothes?\nLike, what is that a uniform?\nIs that work?\nWhat is that?\nThe the clothes look interesting.\nWhat's the history of behind that?\"\nI'm trying to get it something that involves a little bit more knowledge than just observation.\nWhat style of clothes is that?\nMaybe.\nYeah, there we go.\nUh, anime character sailor style shirt.\nOkay, so great.\nAll right, um, interesting.\nCool.\nOkay, and then you you currently, you don't combine these, the Bounty box with the VQA, uh, no.\nUh, what you can do is, um, you have to pH that our image encoding can be done up front, and it's pretty cheap to do.\nSo once you encoded the image, that takes about 150 milliseconds or so.\nYou can run multiple prompts on it for fairly cheap.\nMhm, cool.\nHave you um, can you go even deeper under the hood in terms of the ML behind this?\nLike, it's it's to to sort of figure it out, like, how are you um, training in order to get like it to adhere to JSON, APPA when you ask for XML, or to answer questions, and what kind of data sets are you using to get there?\nAnd and then you've added like bounding boxes, and that sort of breaks my brain in terms of like, well, how do you do both in one model, you know?\nAnd then they've got gaze detection, which you haven't showed us, but we we could show that in a minute.\nUm, how how do all those things work together?\nIt's one model.\nLike, tell us where does it where does uh, how does that happen?\nYeah, uh, one of the things you mentioned was historically, like most of the early vision language models were mostly just focused on captioning, BP, etc.\nThat's right.\nThe reason for that was the data that's available for people to train on is image and all text pairs, and so if you want to do like a big internet pre-train and whatnot, that's what you're doing.\nSure.\nUh, to get these other outputs, you have to transform those captions, uh, the all text, which is very noisy, by the way, uh, into other formats that your users are interested in.\nSo, for example, if uh, you get a caption that says, \"Three men standing on a hill,\" uh, you can use another language model, a text only language model, to transform that into question answer pairs, like, \"How many people are on this hill?\"\nSo you're you're using a a pipeline pre-training to generate the things that you'd like it to be able to answer that the captions are the answers for.\nAnd that becomes the data set.\nBut how do you get data for bounding bugs?\nUh, there's a lot of publicly available data sets for that one.\nOkay, it's a old field of computer sence in sort of captioning, question and answer, bounding box, gaze detection, all into one giant kind of dating set.\nThat's your training.\nWant to one model.\nOne of the interesting things I observed was in the tech space, people have largely consolidated on LLM as interface, like whether you're doing classification, tagging, uh, entity extraction, you just use an LLM.\nThat consolidation hasn't happened yet in the vision space.\nNo.\nRight now, people are you use YOLO world if you want to do object detection, you use Sam if you want to do segmentation.\nUm, we're seeing a l lot of benefits from like this cross training.\nSo when we did case detection, for example, it made the model better at answering questions like M, which direction is she facing?\nGot it wrong.\nWell, from her perspective, it's left.\nThat's a good that's a good test case.\nYou can never be wrong.\nUm, but yeah, uh, we have a internal Benchmark for this.\nHistorically was a struggle for this exact reason.\nLike, in a lot of cases, the caption say, \"Looking to their left, looking to our left,\" uh, model doesn't really pick up on that, but G detection improved that.\nHow do you I don't know if you've seen Quinn's visual reasoning, uh, stuff, which is a large model, totally different in that sense, but um, compare the the what's going on there to the VQA, and for those who haven't seen the Quin, maybe can you explain what I'm talking about?\nUm, if I'm thinking of the right release, uh, quen did an 01 style reasoning model, yes, of QWQ, and then they attached uh, they later released a vision version of that where they attached Vision encoded.\nAnd so for those who haven't tried it, it's fascinating because you and they're very transparent about, \"Here's the reasoning.\"\nSo if you give a picture like this and you're like, \"Where is she?\"\nIt'll it'll be like, \"Well, okay, this is a Japanese anime, so it's probably in Japan.\nLet's look at the background.\nThis could, although it could be,\" and it's sort of like it talks out loud like a like a person exposing their inner thoughts.\nThat's very interesting.\nI'm curious, how does your VQA differ from that and what's going on?\nUh, quen's model is very focused on reasoning, uh, beyond just images.\nYeah, so we we're solely focused on solving the problem of visual perception for developers.\nIf your task is like, \"Hey, I want users to be able to take a picture of a differential equation and then solve it,\" um, Moondream can at best give you the latch representation or a description of what the problem is.\nYeah, we're not focused on solving it.\nUm, we we have been working, this hasn't shipped yet.\nWe have been working on a uh, an implementation of a Chain of Thought over here, uh, that's specifically focused on solving visual reasoning problems.\nReading gauges has been like my Nemesis for the P couple of months, um, because of data set bias.\nLike, every gauge on the Internet is just set to zero.\nUm, so we've uh, come up with this sort of visually grounded Chain of Thought where it's like, \"Hey, I see this CGR label here, the needles here,\" etc., and then we use that to.\nSo it sounds like you're very focused on like this, including this feature is to sharpen the tool that you're building, and the tool is for very specifically, you want to nail a bunch of vision use cases, which could be used in robotics and automation and mhm, just simple classification and queries and all that, right?\nOkay, and and that's why that that's very clear now.\nAnd and let's talk about like positioning in the market, like the small, like the 0 five 500 million parameter is very small.\nYeah.\nUm, I'm not going to ask about benchmarks quite yet, but like, talk about where it can run.\nLike, can I run on Ras pie?\nYeah, uh, let me talk about why we did it and how we did it first before I get to the uh, stats.\nUm, in Vision, unlike text, um, it's still important to run on edge.\nA lot of people don't want to upload their data to the cloud, or they have a lot of data, so it's really inefficient to send to the cloud.\nYeah.\nAnd so, uh, 2 billion is like a decent size for a home desktop with a GPU and whatnot, but for Edge, it doesn't really work.\nSo what we did was, uh, we developed this technology that allows to take the 2 billion parameter model, select a set of capabilities, benchmarks, or like, \"Hey, this is the one query I care about,\" and then shrink it down to size.\nWe pick 0.5b is kind of an arbitrary target, and a couple picked a couple benchmarks that we wanted to preserve performance on.\nM, and it was more of a proof of concept that like, \"Hey, we can prune it.\"\nUh, we wanted to prove to ourselves that our thesis works.\nUm, I what is the optimal when I'm uploading a picture to it to the 0.5 model, and you know, I mean, if I give you a 10 megapixel image, it's not going to give me any more accuracy, right?\nWhat's the optimal the size of the image?\nYeah, if I'm using Moondream, should I resize my images before I send them to you?\nUm, yeah, our SDK does that automatically, but if I wanted to make it faster, I might not want to send them.\n\n\nOver the, um, it can. We, we do dynamic\ncropping based on the aspect ratio. So\nthe real question is, like, what is\nthe maximum pixel area that you can send\nin dynamic cropping, meaning you're\ncropping to the interesting part of the\nimage? No, like, if your image is wide, then\nwe allow you to be more wide. There's no\nmaximum resolution, but if it's also tall,\nthen we reduce the width. So, like, 1.7\nmillion pixels is our,\num, is our max supported resolution for\nthe two billion parameter model. So, you'd\nrecommend we crop down to that number?\nOptimally, it depends upon your task. If\nyou're doing something like OCR and it's\nlike a tiny part of the image, the model\nneeds that high resolution. If it's stuff\nlike, is there a person in this room, like\nthe lowest resolution, 378 by 378, so you\ncan go way lower for that, because you're not,\nyou're, the model runs way faster that\nway. Okay. Oh, it does. So, it's interesting\nas an application developer to, to\nunderstand this and maybe even benchmark\nand test it in your own apps. Yeah,\ndifferent tasks require different amounts\nof resolution and processing, and there's\na knob that you can, and you might have\nto chunk things up, obviously, if you've\ngot, like, gigapixel, you know, handwriting\nor something. Yeah. Um, coming back to\n0.5B, uh, again, arbitrary size that we\npicked. We think most customers will want\na custom version of the model for their\nhardware and their task, but yeah, it runs\ngreat on Raspberry Pi. Decent, how much\nmemory? Um, when quantized to int4, it uses\n816 megabytes. There you go. Wow, okay. And\nwe not quantized the full model. There's,\nthere's more all. So, stepping back out\nfor a minute, like, okay, you've seen\nCoqui TTS, which is Texas speech with 80\nmillion parameters. We were playing with it\nearlier. Uh, Koko, Moondream. What would\nyou use for, like, a light LLM for, for\njust, uh, would you use Tiny LLaMA or\nsomething? Um, I think LLaMA 1B has been\nperforming great for us. 1 or 3B. 1B.\nOkay. So, those three things honor a Raspberry Pi,\ncan they run? I think Tiny LLaMA can,\nright? Uh, they can run. Um, it's, it's\nreally a question of, like, uh, processing\nspeed or spend another hundred bucks. Yeah,\nokay, and then get, or maybe have two of\nthem. Airgout, you've got HAL 2000, pretty\nmuch. I mean, it's incredible that we're\nhere already. It's barely 2025, and you\ncan actually build this in a weekend and\nhave HAL 2000, like, and they actually\nstart to do function calling in your\nhouse and stuff and not have to share,\nlike, I, we were, you know, I, I've been, as\nyou know, for months and months, talking\nto you about, like, how do I do, uh, image\nrecognition. So, maybe we'll talk about\nthat next. Thing I want to build is an\nairgout home automation security system\nthat I feel comfortable, like, using my\ncameras. I have indoor cameras for a\nsecurity. I'm not streaming those to the\ncloud at all, because we walk around\nnaked, right? I mean, many people, and I'm\nnot worried about, you know, one of the\nbig providers, like, you know, violating\ntheir security agreement. I'm worried\nabout leaks and, and, and things. It's just,\nthere, there's use cases, I think, where,\nand, and working and performance, too. I\ndon't want to bog my network down\nstreaming all this to the cloud all day\nlong. It's just, it's,\nI really, really love the idea of an airgout\nsecurity system that's built on these\ncomponents where I could start to\ndo interesting things. And, um, but let's,\nlet's, let's double-click into the, uh, um,\nthe one aspect I just brought up. Do you\nremember it was,\na, if I'm doing, uh, image recognition, uh,\nif I'm doing Moondream locally, uh, okay,\nsorry, we're going to cut this piece out,\nso I want to look too stupid, stupid, but, um,\nbasically, uh,\num, the, oh, we're talking about gaze\ndetection. Are we talking about? No, I want\nto bring that in. Um, what we just talking\nwas some home security, home security. Oh,\nyeah, the image recognition. So, all right,\nso you've got HAL 2000, you want to do\nautomation and security. Uh, I come home,\nit recognizes that it's me as opposed to,\nlike, my son or my wife, and it knows, you\nknow, whatever, to play the jazz music, I\ndon't know. Yeah, okay, which can do. I\ncould call Sonos, I can do this, I can\nhave my camera send and do this\ninference easy, but I need to know it's\nme, not a delivery person, not the mailman,\nnot, you know, a friend. Yeah. So, you know,\nflux are these things I fine-tuned. They\ndo a fantastic job in that direction of\ntaking samples, a relatively few samples,\nand generating what would fool my mom\nsynthetic images. Can I do the reverse?\nCan I Moondream? Can I fine-tune Moondream in\na way that will uniquely recognize me\nand not falsely someone else?\nHow much data would I need if I was to do\nthat? Um, yeah, this is one of those cases, the\nmodel hasn't seen enough of you, are bad,\nso doesn't work out of the box, but, uh,\nbut for, can I, we provide fine-tuning\nscripts. Um, you can run it for free on a\nGoogle Colab instance. Uh, for this\nspecific case, like, hey, I needed this to\ndifferentiate whether it's me or some\nrandom person or someone else in my\nfamily, is that a use case of fine-tuning\nin this case? Uh, yes, you probably need,\nlike, um, I think you start with 10 images\ninitially, and then you can expand that\nto 100 or so with, like, random crop,\npopping, flipping it, and whatnot. Uh, we've\nseen it work great for people. Uh, you can\nrun it in a Google Colab notebook, fits in\nthe free tier. So, so, if I had another guy\nwas basically my height and weight and\nhair color and stuff, he'll play jazz\nwhen he enters your house, kind of not\nHAL image, right? And it's kind of small.\nYou think it would actually differentiate\nbetween us? Um, if enough fine-tuning,\nthat's a use case, like, the harder the\ninference gets, the more data you're\ngoing to need. Sure, but, but that's a\nvalid use case of fine-tuning. That's,\nthat's fantastic. Said that I would not\nrecommend people use this for home\nsecurity. Don't unlock my door if it sees\nme, because I'm going to show up with a\npicture. Well, what I'll probably use is\nthe Coqui TTS, uh, ASMR voice. Yeah, to be like,\n\"Hi, I don't recognize you, who are you?\"\nAnd then have the person say their name,\nand then I'll use that to train eventually.\nYep. You're like, \"What kind of music do\nyou like?\" Um, it's fascinating to just\nimagine these use cases. What are some of\nthe practical use cases that you're\nseeing people, you're out there on\nTwitter, you're a master ship poster, by\nthe way.\nCongratulations. Um, it's a disease. It's\nyou're really good at it. Um, no, I'm, I\nmean that in a complimentary sense, but\nobviously, you've had some, um, some good\nposts. Moondream's out there, people are\nplaying with it, they're pulling it down,\nthey're tinkering. What are you seeing\nthem, uh, build on the tinkering kind of\nside, and then also, like, when they bring\nit into their company and they deploy,\nwhat are some of the use cases that\nyou're getting excited about? One of the\nthings that's amazing about running an\nOpenSource project is you put something\nout there and people educate you on how\nit can be used. So, some of the things\nthat people are using it for has blown\nmy mind. The best example I have is\nthere's a rancher somewhere in Texas who\nhas cows that sometimes get out, and you\nwant to fly a drone over his property\nand find, like, hey, are there cows where\nthey shouldn't be? Wow. So, he flies the\ndrone autonomously to just alert, or I\nbelieve so. I didn't dig into this a lot.\nThis was way back, but, um, in terms of, uh,\ngeneral, where we're seeing a lot of\nadoption is places where people may,\nthey're either processing a lot of data,\num, there's diffusion model training\ncompanies that use Moondream to\nsynthetically caption hundreds of\nmillions of images to their models. Um, or\nplace that, that to me, that use case makes\na lot of sense, because, you know, I don't\nneed to send it over the cloud to\ninference provider that's got a really\npowerful model, and I'm doing an airgout use\ncase, so I need to, the 500 million will\nwork, and I can run it locally super fast\nand get through all my data quickly. So, I\nI think that's interesting. Yeah. In terms\nof commercial usage, we're mostly seeing\ninterest in places where people need air\ngapped, um, uh, vision solutions. So, it's\nstuff like workplace safety, uh,\nmanufacturing in a lot of cases, air gap,\nuh, retail, surprisingly, like, the, the\nrooms where they stock stuff often don't\nhave good internet\nconnectivity, um, home security, I would\nhave used. So, we, we, you know, my last\ncompany, we, we, which is still running, we\nhave freezers which are basically Faraday\ncages. I mean, they're incredibly air\ngapped. It's like, we couldn't do anything\ninside them, but we did have a need for\nmonitoring, um, both for theft, but for\nsafety. Yeah, and, and also for optimizing.\nWant to, like, measure, like, how long does\nit take for a person to get from here to\nthere, and it would be very simple now. I\ncan see this to build a system where you\njust kind of collect data and you get\nthis translated into whatever your\ndomain set is, like, person arrived or a\nperson exists in frame, and then a script\nto, like, compute the travel times or\nwhatever. It'd be easy to accomplish some\nof the scenarios that we thought were,\nwere we would never get to without\nhaving a stand in a freezer with a\nclipboard for an 4 hours. Yeah, and have\nit be, you know, suboptimal anyways. So,\nit's, it's, is I can see the air gap in\nindustrial use cases. A lot of this would\nhave been possible five years ago was\njust been really expensive, because you\nhave to hire an ML team and train custom\nmodels. Sure. Yeah. I mean, the first really\nexciting moments in deep learning were\nin vision, right? And so, I think that's\nwhere I got tipped off to, like, you know,\nI've been going to the University of\nWashington computer science PhD\nsymposiums every year, and it was\nprobably 2008 or 9 where, uh, you know,\nneural nets were being sprinkled into\neverything, whether it was database, human\nfactors, you know, UI. Yeah, I mean,\neverything was wrinkling in as you, and\nthen you had, of course, everything that\nhappened since, um, then in the benchmarks\nearly on, AlexNet, etc. Um, well, let's, now\nthat we're on the research topic, what\nare in the current state of vision\nmodels and reasoning and everything\nthere? What is the hard ons solved\nproblems right now? Um, the one that's top\nof mind for us is the fact that, like,\nwe're training these models mostly on\ndata source from the internet, and\nthere's heavy bias over there. The two\nexamples I like to give people are\nreading gauges. Uh, most gauge pictures on\nthe internet are product detail pictures.\nThey're set to zero, so the models learn\nto tell you what type of gauge it is,\nrange there is, but it can't tell you\nwhat it reads. Similar thing with the\ntime, like, there's most clocks tend to be\nset to 10:10, because manufacturers think\nit looks like a smiley. Uh, and is this an\nimportant case for business customers?\nBecause Glocks, not so much, but it's\nabsolutely. And they're kind of related\nproblems, uh, industrial, right? Like, in a\nlot of oil and gas, for example, you have\na bunch of facilities that are remote.\nYou ideally like to not have to send\nhumans to read those gauges. And, Y, where\nare you on visual recognition of, like,\ncomputer interfaces and mobile\ninterfaces and web pages? It's something\nrecently started working on. We do fairly\nwell on, like, uh, smaller sized images,\nlike, if on your mobile screen, or if you\ndownsize your, uh, browser a little bit, uh,\nthat's one of the main reasons we\nintroduce the pointing feature. Um, maybe\nI can show a quick example if I have a\nscreenshot for you\nguys. I'm not sure\nbecause we can crop here.\nYeah, I\nneed, I mean, just take a screenshot of\nthis. So, yeah, in the pointing feature, the\nimage is a little small over here, but\nyou can see the\nC button, and it detected these. Can you\nzoom in them? Yeah,\nabsolutely. Um, so, yeah, we're, oh, sorry,\nwe're looking at a screenshot of the UI,\nand it is circled the thumbs up from the\nthe UI of the sandbox. Cool, wow, that's\ngreat, pretty tight. So, we're pretty\ndecent at detecting buttons. Um, what we\ndon't have is, like, some sort of driver,\num, that says, like, hey, based on this\nscreen and the task the user is trying\nto perform, here's what I need to do.\nWe've seen people, like, Open Interpreter,\nfor example, pair it with, like, a\nreasoning LLM. So, Moondream is a vision\ncomponent, and then Code Str, for example,\nmight be, like, okay, I need to click this\none. Sure. Yeah, that's an interesting. I\nmean, there's so much, like, test\nautomation and, and automation that you\ncould do with, with something like an\napproach like this, and again, like, being\nable to run it locally and make it be\nefficient and fast and repeatable is\nprobably really useful. Yeah. I don't, I\nmean, for all the goodness of the\nfrontier models, they change a lot, and\nthat's going to, that could throw off\nsomething where you're trying to get\nprecision. So, I can kind of see why. I'm\npersonally very interested in UI\nautomation things. Yeah, the change aspect\nis something a lot of customers bring up\nwith us, like, once you have a product\nthat's shipped and working, you kind of\ndon't want to touch it, because no. So,\nyour provider decided to upgrade, and now\nyour prompts have to change, and models,\nthe, the hosted models change a lot. Mhm.\nI'd like something frozen and, and\nreliable, and especially if we're talking\nabout devices in an air gap environment,\nI can't patch them very easily, right? I\nneed it to be, like, checked past my thing\nand deploy and sleep well at night. So, I,\nI see your use cases in, in those\nscenarios really strongly. Talk about\ngaze detection. We haven't shown that one.\nDo you want to show what that is? Yeah,\nsuper cool. I've got it up here. Um, this\nwas a feature we mostly threw in because\nwe thought it was going to be fun. Uh,\nlook at that, and it makes for great demo\nvideos. Can you combine this with VQA and\nsay, like, what is the person looking at?\nUh, yes. So, we have a feature in VQA where\nyou can give it a point that you're\ninterested in, so you can point at the\nperson's face, uh, in your prompt, and say,\nwhere is this person looking at, and give\nyou a textual description of what\nthey're looking at. Oh, that's super cool.\nUh, I think there's applications in. So, we\ndid it just because we thought it was\nfun, um, but it blew up, and people were\ntelling me, telling, telling us about all\nsorts of useful things. What are the use\ncases you've seen? Um, sports, uh, like, what\nsports tracking, like, build, like, UIs for\ncoaching, coaching. Yeah, I mean, keep your\neye on the ball, right? Yeah. Um, here's an\nexample when you're climbing, like, we can\nmonitor what you're looking at or what\nholes you're interested in. I can see\ncoaching feedback, physical therapy, uh,\nyou know, scoring, and, and, yeah,\ninteresting. Detecting cheating during\nexams, like, am I looking paper, looking\nat somebody's cards in poker? Yeah, um,\npoker was one of the things we included\nin our demo video for this. Um, I'm very\ninterested in home automation with this\nand things with super annoying is, like,\n\"Alexa, can you turn off the living room\nlight number two?\" Like, instead, if you\ncould just look at it, yeah, be like, \"Turn\nthat off,\" you know. The Clapper was, I\nlike The Clapper, it's ambient, I don't have to\ntalk. I, I just, but it's so lame, and I\nthink I would rather be, like, if I look\nat my lights long enough, they just turn\non. Yeah, just like, and have it be an\nambient, an ambient agent that's looking\nat my security footage and running a\nthing and Moondream, and it, it triggers\nthe behavior I'd want, um, at the moment\nwhen I did not want more. Who, who wants\nmore glowing LCD screens in their house\nwith device driver updates and popups\nand alerts and, you know, I don't want any\nof that stuff, and I think I like the\nidea of, of a, a bespoke\n\n\nTechnology like this and very focused for running in the background and waking up when I need to, and I can't, you know, I cannot run a video stream to the cloud 24/7, and I can't run inference 24/7. Even then, it would add up; the cost would add up. Even the cheap models would add up. And so, running something on a... I guess I need to look at the electricity cost. What is the electricity cost? Whoa, hold on a second, motion sensor, maybe, I don't know, motion sensor.\n\nSo, speaking of, um, you know, I, I, I don't want to run a stream to the cloud of all video all day long from six cameras and inference in the cloud. It would just add up, you know? But, but if I was running it locally on a Raspberry Pi, what would the, what would the electricity power consumption be? Uh, that's not something we've measured, so I'm not going to throw a number out. But in general, for... I've seen a number that's like... Yeah, let me just not speculate and miss people. Uh, power usage scales linearly with, uh, parameter comp, for the most part. It's really a proxy for flops. And, um, most models in this... Like, yeah, compare this to a 7B or a 20B model running in the cloud, it'll be about 10 times less energy usage. Makes sense.\n\nCan you choose the API so that people have an idea of... You've got those four modes or five with the... Yeah, the gazing, of course. Yeah, so there's a couple of different ways to use it. It's in Hugging Face Transformers. I'm going to zoom in a bit. Um, super easy to get set up. If you're already using Transformers, you set the model up. Uh, if you want a caption, you just do model.caption. Uh, streaming is super simple, too. We've made this simpler than your typical Transformers model, so it just yields a set of tokens. You don't have to deal with a tokenizer or threads and whatnot. Cool. Um, if you want to ask a prompt, um, you can pass that into our query endpoint. If you want to detect an object, you call .detect, and it looks like you could actually call it multiple times for one image. Correct.\n\nDo we have an example? So, there's another method here called encode image. Um, this, um, where you like pre-process the image up front, it runs it through all of the Transformer components it needs to run through and stores them. It takes about 60 megabytes of RAM to... No, not 60, around 30-ish megabytes of RAM to store that, and then you can call, pass in the encoded image, wh... You pass in, um, a regular image, and it won't pre-process it, so it's pointer to your thing that you've already encoded. And then, exactly, you can run, you can run all the different inference modes that the VQA, the captioning, the pointing, all G detection over and over, and it's fast at that point. Ex... It this way now. Um, so this was the Transformers version. We also have a Python and orus client, um, that lets you run it locally. We get like this faster inferences on your Python client. Uh, we also have an API, like I mentioned. Um, if you don't want to deal with figuring out local inference before you can see if this even works for your app, you can just use it. We give you a bunch of free requests. Uh, if you need more, let us know. Yeah. Uh, if you're using OpenAI, by the way, like, uh, it's three lines of code that you have to change to just try it out and see if Moondream fits your... Fits your... Oh, cool, compatibility. Mhm, that's great.\n\nThis was one of the things we learned at the AI Tinkerers hackathon, actually, where, uh, a lot... We were like, \"Hey, you can run it locally and whatnot.\" A lot of people are like, \"Why don't you just give me an API? Like, I don't want to mess around with this local inference stuff. Just make it easy for me.\" Really? Yeah, yeah. I think that's right. For application developers, it's, it's... We're used to putting in API calls, simple. Um, that's, that's great. It was good.\n\nWhat else did you learn at the hackathon? What was the value you got out of, out of that? You know, honestly, like when we came in, we're like, uh, we're pretty busy, so we're just going to camp out in a corner and work on our stuff and see how it goes and answer questions if people have them. It was surprising to see how many people went and built with Moondream. I think, yeah, something like out of 10 teams or something were Moondream. That was very energizing for us. Yeah.\n\nWhat were some of the cool projects that, that we saw? Um, Moon Paint was cool. There was this team that was, um, taking pictures from Google Street View. Try... So cool. See, like, \"Hey, is, is the paint messed up?\" So they could send... We should call them and knock on the door, put a flyer there. Yeah, uh, that was cool. Yeah, that was the one that really stood out for us.\n\nAlso, the need for being able to find you in the model. Yes. Um, there was a team that struggled then, but will not struggle now because we've since made some improvements. Trying to detect Wildfire, so there's like a grid that used to assess, um, how the state of the brush. Yeah. And they tried to use like every model out there, but like no one was really good at taking that grid and being like, \"Hey, this other picture is at like an eight or seven or nine.\" Uh, so if the technology has gotten better to solve that use case, the, uh, the need to solve it has also gone up with LA fires. Yep. So that's an interesting, very top of mind for people.\n\nWe should probably do another hackathon. We are doing another... H... Um, that's really, really cool. Um, what about robotics? You haven't mentioned any, like, robotics use cases, use in actual robots or home... Um, robotics is something we're just starting to explore. I think for most people, uh, in robotics, like 2 billion is a really big size. You need the robot to respond a lot faster, so with our pruning, uh, that's something we're going to start exploring soon. Uh, we did have a project, I forget the exact name, um, they were basically taking existing vision models and training a robotics action head on top of them. M. Uh, and they did, uh, they supported a bunch of models, but I feel... I suspect there's a bit of a gap there where nobody's really optimizing the vision model for the final task.\n\nDid you see Maxwell's, uh, drone project by chance? I don't think so.\n\nI published a One-Shot video about it, but it's... He's got a Justin N running on a large drone to do some local vision stuff, and then he does streaming to the cloud with an efficient protocol to do some heavier, you know, reasoning and tracking and device command stuff. But it's, it's interesting to see, um, you know, here's a guy who's like, he works at SpaceX, he's a few years out of school, you know, young guy, and he's cobbling together very intelligent, advanced systems using these kinds of components. I, I feel like, uh, I mean, right, there's two things happening: stuff like that and... slop, you know? And I'm kind of excited about this, this stuff where ordinary people, ordinary amazing engineers can build incredible things that were kind of felt like moonshot ideas a few years ago with things like Moondream.\n\nUm, what, uh, would you say to someone who wants to train their own models, like you've done that? Were you doing that before? Let's give a little bit about your background, yeah, in ML, and and how did you come to this?\n\nI studied machine learning in college, uh, maybe 10, 12... I forget when, but, um, it was back before we were doing deep learning, so it, it sucked. We were using MATLAB. Yeah, speech recognition stuff with handcrafted features, so I was like, \"I need to get out of this field as soon as possible.\" Um, so I joined Amazon, worked at AWS for like eight years, I think. Stable Diffusion coming out was like the pivotal moment for me. I was like, \"Wait, what am I doing?\" Interesting. Uh, so that weekend, I went out, bought a 3090 from someone on Facebook Marketplace and started tinkering.\n\nComing out to that the moment, actually. So people forget, but before LLMs were open sourced, right? Yeah, Stable Diffusion was the first thing that gave me hope that there would even be an open source large AI thing at all. It was... Ual people love creating images, and you could tune it. Great way to get into it. So that's how I got started, watched a bunch of videos about diffusion models, Carpathy, neural networks, Hero to Hero, uh, tried to move internally at... You trained ML in school in the theoretical classroom sense. At AI at Amazon, were you doing... No, nothing?\n\nI distributed systems engineering, laying bricks. Yep, okay. And then you got inspired when Stable Fusion came out. It's not that many years ago, three. That, and and then started learning. How did you learn? What were the resources? Carpy, Kathy? Um, uh, Jonathan Whitaker has a really great series. I think his YouTube channel is called Data Castet or something like that. Um, amazing course on diffusion models, goes super deep into how UNet works, what not. That was the primary resource. Oh, cool. We should tag these people when we publish this. Yeah. Um, mostly that, and, uh, honestly, I think one mistake a lot of people make here is like trying to read too much, too many papers, too many... Yeah, just do... Go find you a model, try to build something, see where it breaks. Yeah, this the same advice for use of frameworks.\n\nYeah, just do it. Just build it. Um, what is your opinion on... I mean, talk about your tinkering. I mean, you're not only doing, uh, this stuff, you're using this stuff, but I'm sure you're tinkering like we all are with all kinds of stuff. Tell us, tell us more. Um, what's top of mind for me right now is coding agents. Um, I think, uh, I tried out Open Hands recently, and I was kind of stunned by how good it was. Obviously, a lot of sharp edges, but it's definitely to the point where you can see the potential. Like, it's like having an intern on call 24/7. Interesting.\n\nHave you tried Bolt or Windsurf, or I assume you use Cursor?\n\nI don't use Cursor. I'm a... I'm a Zed user. Do... Oh, what's that? What, uh... Zed, it's, uh, is that like Vim or something? No, it's, uh, it's a... I forget. I think this might be... Might have been the guys who made Atom or something started... I'm embarrassed to not know it. I... This destroyed my own Crow right now. Um, so I tried out Cursor. I found that for the types of work that I was doing, um, which is writing a lot of PCH code, the LLMs aren't very good at it right now. Yeah. Secondly, like when they screw up, like when when you screw up, most code, you can tell that something is broken. When you're training models or writing inference score, everything looks like it's working, and your accuracy is just short. So, um, I've been avoiding using LLMs a ton for most... You mean because it might produce something that runs and spends a lot of waste a lot of time before you understand that it was wrong? Yeah, I can see that.\n\nUm, on the flip side, there's tasks that I do, like a lot of data set processing, copy this from here to here, etc., that they're able to do fully autonomously. Like, I don't need to... I need... I don't need to be in the loop for that, and so that's where projects like Open Hands are interesting, cuz you just give it a task, it goes off. Sometimes it takes a lot of time to figure it out, but I don't mind. I can work on other things. Let doing... Have you built... What have you built, like, for just for fun? Um, honestly, Moondream takes all my time. So, gaze detection was a fun project.\n\nating anything like your inbox or social media or monitoring or competitive or research? Um, we are automating the feedback mechanism over here, so when you click thumbs up, thumbs down over here, um, we, um, we have this running, not very well, but I know how to fix it. Um, like LLM looks at what image this is, tries to like look at patterns, and then tell us like, \"Hey, you need to improve this specific capability of the model. Go find some train data for that.\" Yeah. But I think we can go further and have the LLM also like, like generate that data set added to our fine tuning and cool.\n\nUm, you were the first company... Was before it was really a company, but like, who was doing the AI Tinker like World Tour? Yes. I like... Oh, Vik, this is great, you know? I didn't know you that well personally at the time, but we obviously interacted a few times, and you've been in Seattle meet up a bunch of times, and I'd seen you, and but then you were in Paloo, and you were in different cities, and tell me about how you first discovered AI Tinker and what your experience with that was.\n\nUm, first found out about it on... I forget, meetup.com or something. Um, I was honestly very nervous to show up. I was like, \"I'm going to go, there's going to be all these smart people, be an idiot there.\" But it's super welcoming community, everyone's amazing. Um, so I came out to one in Seattle, maybe November of 2023. M. Um, it was amazing. Um, around the time I quit my job, so I was trying to figure out what's next, so I was just like, \"Look, meet people, do I move out of Seattle? Do I start a company? Do I get a job?\" So, um, I just looked up, like, \"Hey, AI Tinkerers happening outside of Seattle,\" would fly there, meet people. Was great.\n\nI've heard people say AI Tinkerers kept was able to keep me in Seattle because I feel like there's a community. Um, this is very... That makes me feel really good. Um, although now you've gone to the Bay Area with the Tinkerers, and has that been valuable?\n\nAbsolutely. There's a lot of people building in a lot of startups, and when you're a startup, you want to sell the startups. Yeah, yeah.\n\nWhat's the status of the company? I know, you know, you have a co-founder, you have... You have employeed, you've got funding, like, tell, tell people about where you are and what your needs are.\n\nYeah, we, we've, uh, we did... We did a raise earlier this summer, fall. Um, there's seven of us now, all in all. Um, where... Who's in your round? Who is... Who is your seed round? Uh, we had, uh, we only did a pre-seed so far. We had Felicis, Microsoft, and Ascend. Yeah, Kirby. Yeah, Ascend. Yeah, great. Um, Ascend was in CrowdCow as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've... I've known Kirby for a long time, and he's invested in two companies of... S is amazing. Like, if you're in Seattle and you want them on your side, yes. I always counsel people, you want former operators who have founder empathy, and that's pretty much the main criteria. It's non-negotiable, and Kirby's got that in spades. I'm glad, I'm glad to hear that that's working out for you.\n\nUm, what else you want people to know about Moondream? Where can they go?\n\nMoondream.AI to get started. Yep. And, uh, what would you like to see them build, and and just what, what else would you like people to know before we wrap up? Um, yeah, go to moondream.ai. It's state-of-the-art vision model running on your computer for free. Um, try it out, build stuff with it. Um, we're very active on our Discord, so would love to see what people do with it. If it doesn't work for you, that's amazing feedback for us.\n\nAwesome. We'll put the Discord in the notes on the show notes, and uh, thanks for coming on, Vik. It was awesome.\n\nThank you for having me. Thank you.\n[Music]\nWa.\n",
