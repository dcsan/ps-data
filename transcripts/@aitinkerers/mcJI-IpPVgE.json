  "cleanText": "A bunch of people are building like personal assistant.\nOh yeah, the AI personal assistants using Composio.\nThat's where kind of tools like Gmail, calendar, Notion, Slack.\nIs it like Indie hackers building it for their own good, or is it product companies building it as a service, or what?\nIt's a mix.\nWe have a bunch of startups, like we have now 300 plus companies.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome to One-Shot.\nThis is our global stage for AI Tinkerers, where we take some of the people who are really on the cutting edge and doing some of the most interesting work that's relevant, exciting, and new, and on the frontier, I think, of what things we're all building, so they can come and let us look under the hood and hopefully inspire us and enable us in our own projects.\nAnd today, today, I'm very excited to welcome Karan from Composio, which is one of the most exciting frameworks, which we're going to get into, but welcome.\nThanks.\nThanks.\nWhat's up?\nIt's awesome.\nAgents is on everybody's mind, and there's new frameworks dropping every day, and three open-source projects and two other things, and there's the browser control, computer control, and everything else.\nIt's hard to make sense of it all.\nCan you make sense of it for us?\nRight now, it's all DeepSeek, right?\nThat's what I see.\nDeepSeek is definitely taken over.\nWell, it's interesting is one of the challenges with Agents that they're wrong.\nIf the more autonomous they are, the more wrong they are.\nDoes reasoning help there?\nYeah, I think kind of reasoning, essentially, better reasoning means better, more complex things can be accomplished by Agents, right?\nSo always that.\nI mean, Deep's been out, the R1, for like a week and a half, maybe.\nHave you seen your customers using it and sharing any improvements or results?\nNot exactly kind of like on the customer front, but I tried a few examples, and like, specifically, a bunch of more complex ones became like much better with R1.\nIn what way?\nI think it's just, I think tool orchestration was much better, kind of like which tools to choose amongst them, choosing the right tools for the right job.\nYeah, and kind of like the complex tools, choosing the right parameters became, uh, much better.\nWell, I'm really excited to like dive in today, but why don't we start with like, what is Composio and showing us the code of like the most basic use of it, so people can get just an idea of what it is?\nYeah, yeah.\nSo essentially, if you think about it, Agents are kind of LLM plus tools, right?\nLike kind of these LLMs are getting more and more powerful.\nYou see these models kind of DeepSeek coming up can probably solve some of these lead code problems faster than a bunch of Engineers combined, right?\nRight.\nBut when you try to connect these LLMs with real-world tools, that's where things start to create problem.\nMH.\nFirstly, you have to kind of dive into the authentication world, where how do you give the LLMs access to the right set of tools with the right set of permissions?\nOnce you do that, you have to design your schema in a way, like we all use function calling or some of the other form of these Agents calling these tools, so designing the schema is that the accuracy of LLMs calling these tools is high.\nYou have to kind of create a bunch of evals around it, etc.\nAnd that's where Composio comes in.\nWe solve for inent authentication, authorization.\nYou can provide the right scope to the Agents to get control of your Gmail, calendar, whatever kind of like tools you're using.\n200 plus tools right now.\nAnd yeah, I think very, very.\nSo essentially, you're taking, you're, you're using the, the, the world is LLMs become useful when they can get work done.\nYeah, and the way software can get work done is through APIs.\nTool calling is your means, but it's not going to get the job done without some middleware layer.\nThat's Composio to make that accessible and easy for a programmer.\nThat's where you fall.\nSo the world is like there are work creators and work doers.\nI always say like, if you're an early-stage startup, eventually, you know, you're like, I need to hire up PM, and they create a bunch of work.\nNow you need more Engineers.\nYeah, LLMs are sort of like that without tool calling and and getting work done, they just tell you more things you could do.\nYes, exactly.\nAnd the promise of Agents is to be able to get work done, and then your route is like, let's go through APIs and make that.\nAnd we're going to get into that.\nHumans get work done with just the browser.\nSo if you can look at visually a screen and just know where things are and know where to click, and obviously, we've seen some really exciting developments there, both in open source and from the big companies.\nWould you consider those are kind of the two alternative approaches?\nYeah, obviously alternative, but I would say it's kind of like, like you don't want everything to be controlled by a browser, right?\nLike these LLMs are stasic models, they can go wrong.\nWhat if instead of creating a lead, they delete a lead?\nAnd yeah, I mean, yeah, I think there's a lot that can go wrong there.\nAnd the other problem that comes in is essentially like latency, for example, and kind of getting some of even simpler tasks done in kind of complex tools like Salesforce, it's, it's going to take like a long time, like minutes to kind of get, like, let's say adding a data set to a kind of customer.\nAnd if you're on a call, if like an Agent is on a call, you can't let your customer wait for that long, right?\nThat's where APIs are a right set of things where kind of you already have the authentication and authorization standard, so you know you can give like very granular access to your Regent, so things don't mess up.\nI have access to everything, there's no off, it's like it's me, but when I give it over to an AI that could delete or disconnect or change my password or whatever, like it's danger.\nThen you don't have the logging, the ability, the fame grade security, the.\nExactly.\nOther words, speed, and speed is important, cost, right?\nYeah.\nBy the way, we are, we're integrated to Anthropic, computer use, we probably integrate with operator, so if you, if you can model the tool and call it, then you can color browser tools.\nExactly.\nSo it's like essentially a mix in the like coming world, it's not going to be like one thing.\nOkay, cool.\nAnd then you sp like 200 or 250 integrations that you've rebuilt.\nWhat does that mean?\nYou've handled all the base case to do off and tool calling in a way that you know it's going to work and not you know, be that's going to work from the get-go, the high quality, and then it's integrated into your tools.\nYou get some visibility.\nIs that is that what you mean?\nYeah.\nWhat are some of those, like, what are the most popular ones in there that are most useful?\nI think I'll just kind of showcase you some of the tools that are present, uh, in Composio.\nSo like GitHub, J send, G post, these are some of the ones that are like developer related.\nThen obviously you have the popular Google ones like Gmail, Google calend, GOOG.\nSo okay, there's coding work getting done is building code and doing coding tasks, and there's coding tools and IDs and software.\nAgent startups are they use, are people like that using composing under the hood to build coding things?\nYes.\nSo kind of like we, we obviously have these kind of GitHub type of tools which people use to, for example, create a PR, sure, like add a coming to a PR, etc.\nAnd then we have like some of like which we call local tools, where kind of you can, you can give Agent access to your local machine or a Docker instance, etc., and like the Agent can clone a repo, start working on it, execute code, etc.\nSo if you're building coding tools, you have both sides of that, so that you can create, you can get the data where it needs to be to build and run and deploy.\nYes, systems that are agentically built.\nAnd then on the knowledge worker side, you mentioned to like Jira and Google Docs, Gmail.\nI used Gmail with Composio last night, it worked great, so that you can get all the access to that stuff.\nOkay, what don't we show, let's show people actually like some code, like show me getting into one of these tools and doing something.\nYeah, let's start with a kind of small example where let's say you want to give, uh, your Agent access to Google Calendar and let it create kind of events.\nSo let's say you have prepared a set of to-do list, like 1 to 3 p.m., you want to do something.\nSo essentially, you can see this is a kind of simplish Agent using creare, or this you can use, by the way, Composio with any of these frameworks, beat cre, Lang chain, llama index, Leta, yeah, all of them, like we have native integrations with all of them.\nSo in this example, I'm using crei, and probably another example, I'm using Lama index to give a breath of the gentic frameworks, and you initialize with Composio, your tool set, you give the tool that you want your Agent to have access to, in this case, Google Calendar, cool, and you can give like full Google Calendar, you can also give particular action, so let's say I want to just give action of like Google Calender creative, and then what I'll need to do is just essentially add action.\nHere.\nSo you're wrapping their API, basically, in that way.\nThat's just a straight API wrapper, essentially.\nAnd some cases, it's a straight API rapper, in some cases, under the hood, we might be calling multiple APIs, in some cases, it's probably like where we feel like the like APIs are very complicated for the Agents, we do agentic, like it's a Agent under the hood inside a tool as well, so you try to make them easier to use as you go or more accessible when it's you know that as Agent is going to use it in a certain way.\nYeah, in a tool called instance.\nI notic one thing, well, here I used your Gmail fetch emails, yes, tool to, and I was passing it English.\nI was saying, get me five recent emails to this address, yes, and it was then using the LLM to generate and run the function called to Gmail's API, which I thought was an interesting approach.\nIs it always that, but it's not always that way, where it's abstracted with a tool, an actual call to Gmail?\nSo essentially, we support kind of multiple ways to use tools.\nI'll just quickly go into one of them.\nSo let's go with Gmail, for example.\nSo I have my Gmail connected, I have multiple of these actions, so we have a natural language where to run it, so send email to, uh, this is my personal email, mhm, stating that I'm busy with chy recording this podcast, uh, today.\nI think I'll just TR 9th January, press generate, it will generate all the required things, so I'm busy with joy, recipient email, user ID, me, and when I'll run it, it has run, I'm, I received this, no sub, yeah, I'm, yeah, that's cool, right on, cool, yeah, and I was able to use it just to, and and I was using Ruby, so I, I had most of the time was honestly spent like deciding how I should bridge over to Python, but I wrote a Python script using Composio, I didn't use any Agent frameworks, I just went straight calls, and I just created the function that was like, given an email address in some English, pull those emails that match that English, and then I pull everything, like tons of data, and then I gave that to Gemini, thinking to owe the thinking, reasoning, interest, tons and tons of data with a a prompt that was like, hey, is there anything in my inbox right now that it deserves interrupting me, you know, like that I should break my workflow, deal with this if it's important enough, I gave some criteria, and in like five or 10 minutes, I have not working, it was pretty cool, and then the setup was, I guess, for people who didn't, because you didn't show the setup, sign up to Composio, decide that I want Gmail as what I want to muck with, you go through the regular Gmail off flow on your website, which was really super quick, I was landed on a page where I get like my Composio key to copy to put in my in like, I never had to search for anything, it was all right when I needed it, and so that was really, really well done, so by the time I ran the test code, I wrote the first time, it actually worked, and I assumed it would break, and it worked, and I looked at the result, I was like, oh my God, it actually worked, it's a good delightful first time experience, I think we tred to kind of hone down the DX, like we try to keep the aha moment, like time to value for our users, like really minimal, I think that's idea.\nOkay, so we've seen like what Composio is, we've seen some code to use it, and I explained how I used it, and right, what about the architecture?\nLike when I'm now running a Composio, one of these tools to do whatever, or three of these tools to build an agentic workflow, let's say, or an autonomous thing, if I'm more in now, I want to deploy that and use it, what do I see?\nWhat first, what is your architecture?\nWhat happens each time I run it?\nWhere's data going?\nYou know, Google already has my inbox, Gemini thinking is what I used to analyze it, that was on my code, but when I pulled it through, did you see all my email somewhere in your server?\nLike, show me the architecture, where's data flowing, how does that all work, and then are there tools that you provide to give me visibility and to like, run time, and then eventually, how are you going to charge?\nLike, show me the the bigger picture, I guess.\nSo yeah, I think, uh, by the way, uh, kind of the data does flow through us, but we are sof to compliant, can see it, uh, and we also support self-hosting for larger customers, so if some of them don't want us to kind of hold the data, that's also possible.\nWhatever your engine is, you have a way to deploy it somehow to an Enterprise customer if you have.\nYes, yes, yes, it's a proper KU C setup, so kind of, yeah, H charts, anybody can kind of deploy it in whichever VPC they want.\nOkay, cool.\nAnd yeah, I mean, the best part is you can kind of like all the locks are visible here, so you can see this was the action that was run for, so like Composio is kind of multi- entity.\nComposio has multi- entity support.\nWhat I mean by that, you can have your account logged in, you can have your users account logged in, and they can be kind of like, there's a concept called entity ID, so let's say like I'm building an application, I want multiple of my users, one of them is Joey, one of them is, so kind of I can have like different entity IDs.\nOh, that's killer.\nYou know what I want to do with AIT CS?\nI have the city managers around the world, I'd much rather build the tool to let them off their LinkedIn or whatever it is, I can help them post content from their events, but have it be on their account, like I want it to be exactly theirs, right?\nSo yeah, yeah, that's what kind of we are enabling.\nOkay, that's great that you have that, I didn't know.\nYeah, you have requests for me to build that, right?\nYeah, it would be a lot of work, that's kind of like why Composio is trying to solve essentially that part.\nYeah, you can use connections, like create and manage connections for your users, so what you need to do is just kind of get an entity, you can pass in like a unique ID for your users, it can be like say kind of just an email ID, for example.\nThat's unique, obviously, and Composio, you creates an entity on kind of like Composio back end for the same, and then for each user, you can kind of initiate a connection, once you initiate the connection, let's say it's an oo based app, for example, like Gmail, Google sheet, most of the newer applications support oo, so you'll get a redirect URL, you'll just need to show that to your customer, your customer needs to click it, they'll get redirected to the Gmail to screen that we have all seen, like you're giving permission, once they give permission, Composio has the and you're storing a\n\n\nManage and then refresh token on your side.\nYes, we are doing all that for you.\nLike, nothing, you don't need to manage the refresh token.\nRefresh it again, again, we do it for you.\nThat's a big deal, actually, right there, because then I can do, you know, these 250 integrations.\nI can do 10 of them.\nI have to like implement that 10 store exactly.\nThat's really nice.\nWell, speaking of, like, what are people using it for?\nLike, what are the cases?\nI mean, you're sitting there and people are interacting with you and asking questions and on your forums and stuff.\nLike, what are some of the use cases?\nWhat are the most common, like, things that are taking off and like that are really big already, you know?\nYeah, so a bunch of people are building, like, personal assistant.\nOh, yeah, the personal assistance using Composio.\nThat's where kind of tools like Gmail, calendar, Notion, Slack.\nIs it like, IND, the hackers building it for their own good, or is it product companies building it as a service, or what?\nIt's a mix.\nWe have a bunch of startups, like, we have now 300 plus companies building on top of Composio.\nSo a bunch of AI Agents companies are using Composio in backing to kind of get access to Gmail and all these kind of tools.\nSo personal assistant is a big one.\nObviously, the other one is like, AI SDR.\nWe recently did a kit launch where you can build your own SDRs.\nWe have connection to Salesforce, HubSpot, a bunch of people enrichment software, like Apollo, ZoomInfo, for people data Labs.\nSo kit would mean you've actually prepared a basic app, some kind of starting repo.\nYes, exactly.\nInteresting.\nDo you have people using those to like enter hackathons to try to get ahead?\nYeah, I think there would be some people.\nWe, you can imagine how impressive it would be to start with a kit like that and have a full working thing that's doing agent stuff.\nYes, but it's also a great way to learn and understand, like, how might I build my own agentic system end to end, you know?\nYeah, I agree.\nIt's really cool.\nAnd then you mentioned different frameworks, like I saw Leta.\nThey're really, they actually debuted at the AI Tinkerers a couple months ago here.\nThat was the first time they showed the framework.\nI was like, it's only been two months.\nI was surprised to see it already part of your platform.\nWhy did you add Leta there?\nI was curious.\nYeah, so in the Leta recently launched their agent development environment, AD.\nSo kind of we have a first party integration where if you want to use tools like Gmail, Salesforce, etc., you can create Composer like account, use the same APIs, and let AD and get access to all these.\nIt seemed to me that their pitch was kind of like, so you've got Lingraph, you've got Vertex AI Agent Builder, you've got like even the the small agent stuff from Hugging Face, you've got DD andex guys, a lot, D Llama Index has jumped in and and others, but Leta's thing was like stateful agents, like they have like, like you log in and see them on their website, you can configure them there as part of the low code plus coding framework, and then you get observability kind of baked in, which is anytime you're agents, you need obser, because otherwise it's so complex.\nThey only launched two months ago, so how did you look up with them?\nI'm curious.\nOh, they are good friends, Charles and S, working together to kind of enable Composer inside their AD.\nGot it.\nEssentially, kind of they're like, they have built something really cool.\nWhy do you think it's, why are you so excited about it?\nI'm just curious.\nI mean, I read the MGPT paper.\nIt was like one of the kind of really cool papers out there.\nI think it launched kind of last year sometime.\nI was a big fan then.\nAnd yeah, it's amazing.\nI think like these kind of Agents, some of them definitely need long-term memory.\nIf you're talking to a personal chatbot, you would want them to know what happened one year back.\nYeah, so something of that statefulness is definitely a must in those type of scenarios, and that's where they've done a great job.\nYeah, I mean, if you're building an agent, I don't want another crud interface as a user.\nI just want something I can trust.\nYeah, so I need the state to be really good.\nLike, ultimately, if I ask for a citation or proof, you need to have it.\nI can't just say update this action item and mark this thing is done or what it's on my priority list.\nI can't do any of that, have it be 86% of the time successful and just random the other, you know, I can't have that.\nYeah, so that statefulness is, you think the solve there is that part of the solve?\nUh, yeah, I think accuracy was personally comes from like a bunch of these, the quality of the tools that I think we are trying to improve and we are somewhat there.\nI think what they help definitely is bringing the right context into the picture.\nSo I'd say like, kind of last week, I was looking at this particular PPD.\nI think that's where the combo helps, where they have the long-term memory of what happened last week and can bring in the right context and we can have good quality tools so that the agent can do the right thing.\nInteresting.\nYeah, was that history?\nIt seems to be part of the next frontier for these kind of apps of utility that you can provide.\nI, I, I remember there are plenty of meeting summarizers, one of them is read.ai, and they're like in the co-working space where we used to be in Seattle, and rather than only just summarize the meeting you just had with the action items, they're also going to tell you like how has the project evolved over the last six months.\nYep, and it's doing that kind of deep memory work that allows that now.\nAs a developer, that's a lot of work, and so having that kind of baked into like the framework that then your tools have access to, that's really powerful.\nThen you could start to build very tailored applications for your domain without having to take on that much work, right?\nWhere what else have you seen used on your platform?\nHow's it?\nI mean, the, when did you get started for one thing, like this idea of like building the connector points for Agents to use?\nIs that the idea that you started with, and when did you get started?\nWe started with a bit different idea.\nWe were essentially building Devon for Integrations, and that's back in 2023 when the LLMs were still not there in some sense.\nWhat we were saying was a bunch of these players in my past have done Integrations where you need to connect with APIs.\nSome of them can be very complex, timeing, and what we were saying was you give us the spec, you give us some of the integration code that you've already written, and we'll generate the rest of it for you, essentially create a P.\nYeah, and we figured like the LLM quality is still not there yet.\nWe were not getting that accuracy, and but at the same time, we had to do Integrations for LLMs.\nWe had to integrate with GitHub, for example, so that the agent can create a PR.\nUh, like we had to, uh, integrate with linear so that like it can look at the linear issues, and that's where we figured like sometime down the line where people are building these agents, when like most of the software will be agents, I think integration for agents will become a very big problem that a bunch of these developers will run into.\nSure, and that's where we started somewhere around like last year January on the current version of Composio.\nAnd yeah, I mean, that has been the journey and kind of a thesis we were very early in that sense.\nLike I think January 2024, nobody was speaking that much about agents, like before that even function calling was getting introduced when we were building coding agents at that time.\nSo things aligned and the Agents became big and integration for agents become a very big problem and like yeah, I think it has been a good right.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nAnd so now you're powering these companies are building personal system applications and SDR applications.\nPeople are building de type use cases using Composio.\nSo like PRW agent, actual coding agents, we have tools like code indexing tools where very similar to ID, like as a human, we have access to so much support and ID where you can click a function and figure out what the function definition is, go to that function, figure out what a class definition is.\nFor these agents to write good quality tools, they also need good quality support, right?\nSo that's what we are providing with like LSP level tooling where agent can query like a function definition and all these.\nWhat if I wanted to do, like, I want to dive into one of them, like, do you have Google Sheets as a?\nSo yeah, okay, so if I wanted to create an app, like, I think the sheet is a great app and Google's sheets is a great, it's multiplayer, all that stuff.\nSo I might want to provision like a little shared resource, a little, you know, schedule or a pro forat estimate of an event I'm planning, anything, right?\nY, where I want to have like, I want to invite some other people into it, but maybe give them less permissions, but I want them visibility, I want to be able to edit, but I also want to write some code to synchronize from like some other data I've got from one of your other tools or my own app.\nI could do that.\nCan kind of come again on the use case?\nExactly.\nSo the use case would be like, for example, let's say I'm planning an event and or series of events.\nSo I have a calendar in a Google sheet, and each row is like a proposed date of an event, and the column is like event name, venue, address, and then like status, like is it booked, is it whatever.\nIt's basically I want to use a Google sheet as a sheared, like, you know, project management interface, right?\nRight.\nAnd so now I'm want to populate that with API calls using agents.\nSo there's something, you know, if I get an email that's like, oh, the the venue is booked, and I'm like, sweet, oh, maybe I CC my agent and be like, venue's locked, and then have it automatically go to the sheet, change that, run row, column.\nYeah, I think that's doable.\nWe support a thing called trigger whereever when it's like notification for show that's just whatever.\nSo I'll quickly showcase you.\nWe have, let's say I go to Gmail and I'm interested not just in the trigger aspect, but like how do you actually reach into a spreadsheet and update one cell?\nLike, what is the interface to specify that?\nAt what level am I Interac?\nSo kind of this is the trigger where you can essentially enable this trigger, like new Gmail received message trigger.\nSo whenever a message is received for the account that the like Composer has access to, yeah, uh, we'll notify you.\nWe support uh, web hook.\nSo if you can create a server, so I go to your website and I say I want to create a Gmail trigger, if something's received to this and as this and this conditions are met, call the web hook, and that's on my server.\nI receive a web hook.\nYeah, you can do that, or you can have very simplified, like we support like web socket type of things where you can create the simple kind of decorator based call back and you'll get like, you can filter here as well, and you'll receive the right event, which you can get, create a function and do.\nYes, exactly.\nOnce you receive an email, you'll directly get this call back, and then you can have an agent look at the email and then update the.\nYeah, this assume I've got the perfect prompt and it knows when to update the status to book, how would I, I need to have the agent go like, okay, find the right sheet, maybe the agent has access to all the sheets that are like in the folder of events, find the right one by name, and then find the right row by vendor name, find the right column by like stat.\nYes, yes, yes.\nHow would I, what is the interface?\nLike I think in the kind of, and by the way, doing this with Gmail or with Google actual APIs would be a royal pain.\nYes, you're GNA help me get done by describing it in English.\nThat's what I want, because if I have to translate that to Google's API codes, it's like a month, it's a dayong effort.\nYes, yes, exactly.\nSo yeah, I think essentially you can kind of get a particular sheet, for that you need a Google Drive actually, because drive has access to all your sheets.\nPerfect.\nSo you have find files where you can get that particular file.\nSo find files is like a tool you have, you get in that drive based on name or whatever.\nYeah, you can give multiple filters and like the agent will give the filters, you'll just describe it in the natural language.\nThen in the sheets, you can kind of, once you have the sheet, you can look up a particular rule, batch get a sheet, etc.\nAnd once you do that, like agent has access to kind of how the sheet looks like, it can go to a particular row or particular column and update it directly.\nOkay, upd spreadsheet would, would inside that one call encapsulate any need everything I need to find and update a column in a single row exactly, like a bunch of columns, a bunch of rows, etc.\nSo the agent can update three rows at a time, one row at a time, whatever.\nWhen I was using Gmail, the Gmail tool, I used it with English.\nI was like, give me the emails that sound like this.\nIs it the same interface here, or do you also have a lower level, like, passes CSV or something you might be using it with something like an open a, etc.?\nSo what they get is the schema, open a CD schema, you can see right here, and the function description, update arrang of cells on Google spreadsheet with provided values.\nExactly.\nVal updated as is Coke.\nI'm just kind of reading through and understanding.\nSo as the developer, when I call the bulk update sheet function, what am I passing to customize it?\nThis is like essentially getting passed to open air.\nIt's all seamless, you don't get to know.\nYeah, but this is what is getting pass to open a US function calling.\nWhat am I sending to Composio besides the name of the tool?\nEssentially, it will be the name of the tool.\nI think this is the one.\nSo you would be doing something like this kind of, you're passing Composer tools set, getet tools, like here you're giving Google sheet, and then this is the national language Stars.\nYes.\nSo I did that with the Gmail extraction.\nI'm asking specifically what is the task string to update a sheet where the row matches this and the column is this, right?\nYou can specify it in national language.\nI would literally be like, hey, update the sheet on the road for Microsoft, the stat, change the status column to done, and essentially open air client will look at the function schema, got it, that open air Composio passes and gives the right set of parameters and you.\nThat's great.\nBegs the question, observability, how do I know it worked?\nYeah, so essentially there are multiple ways to look at it.\nYou'll get a response from open air in natural language, which will have some kind of information around it, but you can also look at it in our loocks.\nSo essentially some of these were kind of successful, some of them were unsuccessful.\nYou can see this is somewhat current form of logs.\nWe're getting like, we launching a much better version of logs by end of this week where you'll have much more data.\nUh, could I also write it?\nI mean, I guess I could.\nI updated the sheet and then I could be like, could I call another call that's like, hey, give me a snapshot of this whole sheet?\nYeah, and then just sort of like, asked, did it update in the way that I expected it to, and then if it failed, I could actually, could I do like undo?\nYeah, yeah, Gmail has that.\nIt's like operating almost like a word.\nYeah, exactly.\nSo you can do all that with like our Google sheet tool.\nIt's like fully autonomous.\nThe agent has access to it, so you can converse in the national language and like see what happened, like it will get the element, show it to you.\nIf it feels like the job was not done right, you get ask it to edit and do.\nWhat can you pull that star GI repo code up again?\nYeah, you.\n\n\nI mean this one, right?\nUm, yeah, that one.\nSo I'm writing code.\nIf I'm not using an agent framework, I'm writing procedural code like this, essentially.\nYeah, with little bits of English sprinkled in to, like, abstract away all that stuff that that would be daunting projects otherwise.\nYes.\nNow, I'm starting to wire this together, and I'm like, okay, in my workflow, I want to get an email reply.\nYes, and then have that trigger go update the spreadsheet.\nAnd I could definitely implement that using everything we're talking about here, and I can implement it in code like this.\nIs there a higher-level abstraction where I could implement even that part just in English?\nLike, if I could model my system at a higher level and say, these are the things that high level, I know I've got an inbox and monitor with these addresses.\nI've got a Google sheet for this and stuff over in that drive.\nEven a spec, I could even spec it like an \"and then have it go, you generate the that code and run it for me.\"\nIs that world coming?\nKind of like a Devon for Agents, right?\nNow, if you index your docs in Cursor, I think it does a pretty good job there.\nThat's what I use for my coding right now.\nSo just do it that way and then still be the programmer.\nYeah, I think I...\nI mean, the future is that, right?\nLike, that that will be the, like, natural language coding thing.\n'Cause I mean, back to, like, Agent Frameworks, if I'm building my agent stuff, first of all, I haven't had much success with autonomous experiments.\nNo one has really yet.\nIt's coming, but and stability system, like, I'm talking about, I need it to work, and I'm okay with doing a little bit of work.\nHowever, the gulf between even that work I just described and having a spec, and today I do just sit in Cursor, but if there was a higher-level abstraction, it'd be great.\nAnd I don't feel like it's LangGraph or CrewAI, because that's just another world where I have to spec it still, still pretty low level, right?\nIs there a anyone working on that kind of, like, low-code spec-driven way of creating agents?\nYeah, I mean, I know a bunch of our customers who are early stage are doing something of that sort.\nThey are in beta, so kind of can't take the name.\nComposio, to the AI Tinkerers meet up tonight.\nYeah, I don't know.\nI don't know, but there are a bunch of no-code, like, stuff that's happening.\nSo, for example, Langflow is one of them.\nComposio is integrated into Langflow.\nOh, interesting.\nHow does it work?\nYeah, it's essentially a no-code builder, kind of like you have, like, all these kind of components, and one of the components is Composio, where you can get your agent access to all these tools, and the other components are kind of chat, OpenAI, where, like, you connect, like, very similar to kind of what you do in the code, connect these dots and puzzles and create agents.\nGot it.\nAnd I'm sure they probably have some stuff modeled that you have modeled as well, like email or whatever, and there's going to be overlap and all these things.\nYeah, I mean, they're kind of like essentially partners.\nSo kind of like Composio is the tool set for them to connect to Gmail, etc.\nOkay, that makes sense.\nInteresting.\nHow do people make sense of just all of the tool choices that are out there?\nWe have tried to be kind of give, like, essentially categories.\nSo if somebody's interesting in developer tools, they can just click developer tools and just get only developer related ones.\nSomebody wants to look at CRMs, then they can just go to and get all the CRM, like, Pipdrive, Hubspot.\nYeah.\nSo a good starting point for you guys would be to see which integrations you've got worked out to get you an idea of what use cases might be most appropriate here, and then the kits are your kits that you described, those pretty well developed out or?\nYes.\nSo I think we recently launched, like, an SDR kit, that's what I mentioned.\nOkay, yeah.\nWe launching a cry to, like, Yi launched Pipen, right?\nOh, yeah.\nAnd that became a really big success, and kind of that's where we are in, like, we have integrated a bunch of crypto Frameworks, like, Coinbase and, like, a bunch others, essentially, and you can kind of do your own, like, web three trades using Composio, the agent, etc.\nSo that's coming.\nWe did a SDR kit launch where, like, you have, you can build your own de using Composio.\nWe have, like, a customer support kit coming up.\nSo a bunch of these things are in the progress.\nWe have a bunch of these tools, but, like, creating good quality templates so that, like, they're production ready.\nYou are mult...\nYou're kind of agnostic to which LLMs you use, right?\nI assume.\nYeah, we are.\nWe have kind of partnered with all the entrance providers.\nSo if you want to use Groq with all the open source LLMs, Deepseek, etc.\nGet AI.\nCan I get...\nCan I use APIs to generate those things in workflows with?\nYes.\nSome of them do exist.\nSo kind of like image generation, kind of passing it, like, uh, a URL at that point or or binary, or it's a mix.\nIn some cases, we support, like, in the SDK, we support taking in from files.\nWell.\nSo if you have a file on your local storage, you want to give access to Composio.\nInteresting.\nSo I don't...\nSo if you wanted to build multimedia workflows using Composio, that would be something you... you do a first-class way?\nYes.\nWe have, like, actually a bunch of users using Twitter media, like, tool that we have, where kind of they can upload, like, Twitter, like, images, etc., as well, via Composio, upload it to Twitter and post.\nTalk, talk about things like LinkedIn, where the LinkedIn API itself is pretty locked down, and there's different levels you apply for.\nYeah.\nDo you have support for that?\nWe have, like, support for kind of the APIs that we have access to, because otherwise it goes into that kind of shady territory, right?\nSo if you're off in as a LinkedIn user, first class, you have a create post.\nYes, yes.\nSo that's interesting.\nWhat about if you wanted to, if you were working with APIs or systems that didn't have APIs or they were locked down, could you up a browser process?\nWhich ones do you support and how would you go about that?\nSo we have local tools, which are kind of in our open source repo.\nSo there we support essentially Anthropic computer use.\nWe have a Docker container where you can give access to the whole browser, etc., like, whole computer, essentially, by Tropic computer use tools.\nAnd I'm running that on my machine and a container on my machine?\nYes, that I...\nOkay.\nYeah, or somewhere else.\nLike, I think we support D2B, fly.io, bun of all these instance Frameworks.\nYeah.\nAnd yeah, that's on our open source side.\nDo you have people using that, though, right now, using computers in production systems?\nI don't know in production, but a bunch of people are using that definitely to do what, essentially, kind of it's like multifold, right?\nLike, as you mentioned, like, LinkedIn, like, that can't be done without a browser right now.\nSo that, like, all the social accounts access, some of them don't have RP stuff, that's more locked down.\nYeah, okay, cool.\nTalk a little bit about security again.\nYou touched...\nWe touched on at the very beginning, and I think it's so...\nWhen you fire up a browser and do stuff, security is a really unsolved thing, right?\nOr it's a little janky.\nLike, what am I going to do, like, store my cookie file and the cloud, and like, that's the scary, right?\nAlso, you're using OA and wrapping that and managing it for me.\nThat feels like that's familiar territory.\nThat's how APIs were designed.\nYep.\nIs there anything else you should say about how your security model works for me as an app developer?\nWe talked about the multi-tenant stuff, which was really cool.\nAnything else in in the realm of security?\nYeah, I mean, like, kind of we have a bunch of data flowing through us, right?\nBut all of that is encrypted.\nSo I...\nI mean, only the user who has created the account can see it.\nWe have, like, a bunch of these kind of multi-project, multi-IP, my emails through Google's API, did that come through you in encrypted form, like, you couldn't even see that?\nYes, essentially.\nWe have it in a database, but in an encrypted form, so I can't see it, but when I use your API to actually work with it, that's at the point you're decrypting it?\nYes, exactly.\nSo that's pretty cool.\nSo if you had, like, a server leak or something like that, it wouldn't be leaking, even in a log file?\nYes, get decrypted, even in that UI, the last, exactly.\nOkay, that's pretty cool.\nYeah, I think we multi-user support, so you can give, like, only view access to some users so that they don't have access to send an email from your account, etc.\nSo that all control you can do, it's proper RBAC that we have built.\nMmm.\nUm, do you have any kits for personal assistance and email related stuff?\nYeah, we have a bunch of uh, starters, like, we have, for example, AI productivity.\nI might have forgotten what it exactly is, but, like, it kind of...\nOh, this one, essentially, we have a image analyzer tools, so it will kind of look at your kind of what's going on in your laptop, and if it sees that you're getting stuck or somewhere, it's essentially will notify you that you can do this to kind of unblock yourself.\nStuck in what way?\nLike, kind of...\nYeah, anything, like, it just kind of uses G, like, GPD 4V Vision to keep on sending the images, and if it feels like you're stuck at some point over, like, three, four images, it will just notify you, you can do this to unblock yourself.\nOh, interesting.\nSo it's an ambient agent example?\nYes, it's an ambient agent.\nThat's really cool.\nAnd it's how many...\nWhat's how many lines of code is that?\nThis is essentially less than 100 lines of code.\nSo it's just a a thing that you're going to run as a daemon on your local laptop or whatever, be there.\nAnd how does it notify?\nWe use system tools, so kind of, like, it's a local tool where kind of we use, like, popup to...\nThat's very cool.\nYeah, we have, like, a calendar agent that I just showed.\nWe have a scheduling agent.\nRemember a presentation agent where you can create, given a data, like, spreadsheet, you can create a cool presentation around it.\nOh, yeah.\nThis is also, like, less than 70 lines of code, essentially.\nIt's really cool.\nI mean, thinking about, like, the local tools we talked, what are some of the other local tools you have?\nFile system.\nYeah, you obviously have access to screen.\nSounds like what else?\nWe have, like, I think system tools, like, notifying you, kind of getting access to some of the notifications that come and pop in.\nYeah, okay, local notification on my OS.\nYes.\nWhat about networking tools for out...\nWhat where my printer is, what printers I have installed, things like that?\nThat's a good idea.\nI think we should have it.\nIt's not there.\nCan people contribute?\nIs there any aspect of this open source?\nYeah, it's open source.\nAll the local tools are kind of open source.\nGot it.\nIt's just going there, and I think we have a bunch of requests of such sort.\nIt's just I think, yeah, kind of like home automation stuff.\nYeah, I think that's also another super cool idea.\nI think we should do that.\nIt's very cool.\nI mean, we none of us would have said this three months ago, but you can you can create H 2000 at home, air GED, like, with vision, with with reasoning now.\nYes, running on your computer, and it doesn't have to be fast if it's running in an ambient agent kind of like manner.\nI, it doesn't have to be super one, two, three, 10 seconds, tokens a seconds, fine.\nYep, if it's they're kind of in the background and and waking up to do useful work for you.\nYeah, yeah, I think I think you can have, like, some IoT level signals to kind of figure out, oh, there there's some fire around you or kind of...\nLike, like a lot of cool stuff, just like monitor energy use or air quality.\nThere's so many devices that you can get now for for nothing.\nYep.\nAnd if they're on your network, you can then figure out a way to get the data and have AI figure out the best way to use that.\nSo, hey, open a window.\nYeah.\nAnd reasoning means that you as a programmer don't even have to think about the use case.\nLiterally, I could be like, here's a bunch of data from different devices, I'm a human, make my life better, and it will probably go, CO2 is high, open the window, exactly.\nAnd then also figure out, like, should I use the son of speakers to make that a loud alert and really interrupt you because this is important, or should I send you an email?\nYep.\nAnd you can do all that with Composio.\nI think that's the future that we want to enable.\nI think that's the future that I see, and that's what we are trying to...\nThat's why I think, like, this is I go back to, like, I want to specify what I just specified as a single Google doc, one sheet.\nYep, and then I just want to go like, that's also somewhat our users are creating, essentially, code-based agents.\nSo there are different paradigms of Agents, like, can paradigms of function calling, uh, one of them is function calling directly, like, using open air function calling, like, Lanch and other Frameworks.\nSome of them use, like, they don't use function calling directly, they put it in the system prom and ask the LLM to output a YAML for S or structured JSON.\nThat's another way.\nThen there's another third paradigm where, like, agents are, like, essentially LLMs are given functions that they can call in the system prom, and they write code using those functions, like, functions are part of that code.\nFor example, instead of, like, the way that we saw the agent is writing code and in in between one of the L just sended this for email in the bracket, like, the right parameters, that's another way of doing function calling.\nYeah.\nAnd, like, yeah, I think coding is improving at a massive kind of rate, so maybe that's the future, maybe function calling is the right way.\nSo yeah, I think we'll get to know, but I think what you just said, I think I like in six months down the line, even bigger specs will be just one agent, like, you don't need to kind of write code to do it.\nYeah, very cool.\nFor neat future to think about, fun to play with.\nWhat are some of the cool things that you see?\nYou're here in the Bay Area now, you've been, how long you here?\nSo I'm properly moving, not...\nOkay, okay.\nSo you guys have been on that kind of by by two cities approach for a while, a lot of people here are, which is great, and now you've got your O one and you're moving here.\nIt's wonderful.\nOff to the Races, a lot of traction.\nWhat are some of the cool things you've seen in the community here?\nWhat have really impressed you or opened up your your mind?\nI mean, I think a bunch, right?\nIt's very difficult to kind of say one, but I think a friend of mine is making video-based agents, so kind of using agenting approach, approach, you can edit videos and, like, create videos on the plan, like, yeah, that's pretty cool according to me.\nY he did Pipen, which is an AI...\nThat's pretty cool as well.\nYeah, coding-based agents, for example, Lutra, I really like the product.\nI think is really cool.\nYeah, I think the whole computer Ed stuff, still think it's like early days, yeah, but a bunch of cool things coming up, a bunch of cool people working on that.\nFriend, I think, uh, it's insanely good, absolutely.\nYeah, what are you tinkering on?\nAny side projects, anything that you're in your spare time, you know, you have pulled out something that dropped and play with it, anything like that?\nI think mostly with, like, Composio, like, kind of like just I think it's so much fun right now, the egch stuff.\nMy side projects are also kind of like one of the, like, the a productive one, productivity one.\nI was just tinkering around, like, last to last week, last week has been a bit hectic, but kind of just because I thought that is a problem where kind of, like, I'm wasting some of my time, and, like, LLMs should be good enough to kind of notify me I'm wasting my time.\nYou...\n\n\nShould just do this\nand move ahead.\n\nYeah, so that's something that I, ENT agent, yeah, ambient agent is really cool, right?\nI think even Harrison did some example around email.\nYeah, I think some really cool stuff on that front.\nVery cool.\nHow did you first hear about AI Tinkerers?\nWhat was your first introduction to the community?\n\nYeah, I think it was our good friends had co-pilot kit.\nI think Yuli messaged me around that, and I saw and was really impressed both in SF and in Bangalore.\nThe best part is you're Global, so that definitely helps a connection uh between both cases.\nB. Balore was actually started by the person who was between two cities uh in this case Seattle, but he was going to be in Balur for his parents or something for a few months.\nWhy don't I start the chapter?\nIt's incredible chapter.\nThey over 100 people show up every time.\nThere's a weight list.\nGreat people involved in the community there.\nI was really grateful to see you pop up as a presenter.\nYeah, there was awesome, so thank you for that.\nYep, well hopefully this will be a big year for you in 2020, and I hope to work together and do interesting things.\nYep, yep, yep, looking forward to that.\nThanks so much for your time.\nWhere can people learn more about Composio?\nWe have a Twitter account, Compos HQ, Compos HQ, and like I think LinkedIn also, just search Compos.\nAll right, thank you.\nThanks so much.\nThanks, thanks.\n\n[Music]\nWhat?\n",
