  "cleanText": "I got this one hilarious email which was, \"Hey Luke, uh, really enjoyed your WhatsApp MTP. I always wish there was a local version of WhatsApp I could query locally. I wish I built it when I was there.\" And I was like, \"Ah, who is this guy Yan? I like Google him.\" It's like, turns out he's the founder of WhatsApp.\n\nThis conversation with Luke Harris was so interesting and so inspiring. Here's someone who's at the very heart of one of the hottest companies, ElevenLabs, a company revolutionizing voice AI right now. Yet, he's constantly experimenting, building, and sharing practical tools that anyone can learn from. He's built some of the most popular MCP servers that are out there. And he takes us under the hood of one of them, the WhatsApp MTP server, the tech, the launch, how he built it, the feedback he's gotten. He also shows a very useful iPhone shortcut that can really enable all sorts of useful applications. It's elegant and surprisingly powerful. And then finally, we dive into ElevenLab's latest APIs, which I think most people aren't familiar with, that allow you to create a full like rag stack with your own data and a web hook back to do virtually anything you need. So, like voice agents in a few clicks. Honestly, it was really cool and very worthwhile. I think you're going to love this conversation. Here we go.\n\n[Music]\n\nHello AI tinkerers and welcome to Oneshot. This is our global stage where we talk to people who are working on the very frontiers of generative AI in some way. I'm thrilled we're here today with Luke Harris of ElevenLabs, who itself is a leader obviously in GenAI and a huge growth story and an amazing innovator, but Luke himself also is an incredible tinkerer with an enormous toy box of cool contraptions and things he's built. So we'll look at a couple of those today, but welcome Luke. Thank you.\n\nExcited to be here Joe. That's really wonderful. Let's dive in. Like you lead growth at ElevenLabs and I immediately think marketing, but you are not a marketer. You're pretty hardcore techie.\n\nYeah. So, I've been coding since I was 12, 13. I have a weird background where I ended up in medical school for a few years, but spent all my time building. Um, and then, yeah, basically was hacking around on my own projects and then Matty phoned me up. Matty, the founder of ElevenLabs, and I actually met during a hackathon ourselves about nine years ago. Stayed in touch. And he phoned me up going, \"Luke, ElevenLabs is growing very quickly. We need someone to join and do the growthy things.\" And I was like, I've never really done the growthy things before, but I'm up for learning it. I you clearly are trying to figure out from the outside and what's on the web is like it's a renaissance story, right? It's like you're studying Pimemed, but you also created like some sports platform with code. It was like obviously you're builder. Uh, and tell me more about that one just really quick. I mean, yeah, that one was um so I was playing rugby. Um you were at Cambridge. At Cambridge. Yeah. Yeah. And I was um playing rugby, captaining the what's called the Lions team, the like third team, playing for the second. Okay. Um and it was my job to organize all the rugby leagues. And when I was handed over this, um it was literally before we were playing like finals matches, not realizing the points different mattered. And I first like MVP of it was like an incredibly complex Google sheets with like appcripts running in the background and then I was like this is actually quite useful. So turned into a like full platform web app. Uh yeah scaled that across. Was that your first I mean if you were coding since a kid was it the first time you got the sort of endorphin rush feedback loop from real usage and or would you have that? I think that was the first one. I built a bunch of like iPhone apps for myself, but none of them I like properly got out in front of users. And then you went on you did some you graduated and did not go into med at all. Uh you went and did software engineering. Yes. Uh consulting it looks like. Uh you also did some cancer some ML you started getting into the deeper end of of the the things cancer research uh work. Yeah. Yeah. Biotech stuff. Biotech stuff but ML. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Fascinating. And then using image models. Was that around the time that you met uh the ElevenLabs founders at the hackathon? Yeah, when I was 19. Well, before ElevenLabs. Okay. And then you also did um so again this renaissance background with lots of interest but also united by building and tinkering. Um you did uh you were a YC founder. You were head of growth or product at Post Hog. Yes. Okay. And that's one where it's like I think Post Hog's story is partly like every Y Combinator company just used them. That was like there. Yeah. That was I um was moving on from my previous company. I phoned up Dalton, our YC group partner, and I was like, \"Dton, what should I do? I'm working out my next move.\" He's like, \"Posts in London. They're doing pretty cool stuff. You should chat with them.\" There you go. The power of community. Exactly. You know, jump in with a community where great things are happening. You can always jump ship or do something or combine forces. You don't know what's going to take off. No. Right. But you're in the middle of it. That's really cool. Let's talk about the tinkering. I want to see something like I know you've done a bunch of stuff that blew up pretty recently on Twitter with MCP. Yes. Um you know again it became popular to kind of talk about MCP and you were like oh I need to go build something. So what did you build? Let's let's Yeah. Well a little bit of the backstory. I I did a tweet the the funky thing I think about the current wave of AI is there's so much innovation on like the business and B2B side but the consumer side is terrible. And I think it's just because there's companies like Meta and Google who own the consumer interfaces, who are fantastic at AI, but just like seemingly aren't shipping the product. So I did this tweet which is like I think you can basically solve consumer AI by connecting a AI agent to your WhatsApp, your calendar and your Gmail. And if you do that, you basically have the entire context on someone's life as well as actually being able to execute actions because you could create group chats, you could send emails, you have all their invoices. So I tweeted this being like, why is no one done it? And I thought about it a little more and I was like, well, the hard bits actually the WhatsApp bit. So like how do you connect WhatsApp to AI? So that's where I was like, okay, I wonder if I can actually do this down the rabbit hole. But the hard bit is WhatsApp has business APIs but doesn't have personal APIs. And so just being able to query your messages is actually surprisingly difficult or send messages. Interesting. They don't have just a basic API for like no search. No, it's very like W garden. Interesting. So how did you get in? Yeah. So I went down a couple of different routes like basically you know did the longtail search of um GitHub repos powered by by deep research and the first time I tried there's this protocol called matrix okay um which tries to abstract all the different messaging apps into one it's like very cool open source project beeper was built on top of it so I tried to get that running and build on top of that abstraction but I'm not sure if it was me or the docs But that was a disaster. And and this was all on a Saturday, by the way. So I did like our trend matrix. And then I was like, well, okay, what's actually underneath matrix? Oh, there's this cool go library, which is written um called what's meow? Um and I was like, oh, like I wonder if that works. And so I pulled up cursor start hacking way. I' never written Go in my life. Um, and yeah, just like with cursor managed to get the first my first goal was like can I get a local copy of my WhatsApp messages on my computer so I can do all the querying. Um, and so we wrote uh I say we me and cursor me and Claude 3 3.5 um wrote this thing. So when it connects the library connects to the WhatsApp uh device API so it pretends to be the browser client and actually when you start the client the first thing it does is load all your messages. So we wrote a hook in order to just save those into the SQLite database. Um and I was like okay great I've done that but I don't like Go and I don't I don't really know Go that well. So then I was like, okay, let me spin up like a simple Python MCP client for that. This was when MCP became the rage and I was like, okay, maybe this could actually be a really cool interface to query it. So then the Python and the Go library just connecting to the SQL client. Um, and then the next thing I did was expose the ability to send messages. So it actually has a little local host server where the Go and the Python library chat. Um, and I built this like basically on the Saturday. Showed my girlfriend on the Sunday or my now wife showed my wife and funny enough my mom and I was like, \"Oh, look. I can send a message. That's pretty cool.\" And my wife was like, \"Nice.\" Like, but what are you going to do with it? I was like, \"Oh, maybe, you know, I've learned a few things about launching products. Maybe I should actually launch it.\" Yeah, maybe a brief side note for all the tinkerers out there is like I actually find launching your own products so much harder than launching your company products because when it's your own product, it's like your ego. You wrote this, you're putting yourself out there. But I was like, \"Oh well, just like lock in for an hour, made a quick video, wrote a tweet thread and launched it.\" And yeah, I think quite early on we got a retweet from Gary Tan. And that was the first initial spike. Nice. And then it like plate it like very quickly got thousand 2,000 stars and then plateaued. So I was like, \"Oh, that's pretty cool.\" Like what other channels could I share it on? So I wrote a hacking news post and then that took it like past 3,000 stars. Um and then there's been a few things after that. But the biggest thing was like I genuinely didn't think anyone else would use it. But kind of the learning from myself and do you know Simon Willis the Yes. He has fantastic blog and one of his pieces was always like you will owe it to yourself for every project you do to just write about it. So I saw it as like okay let's launch it get it out there and it's been really cool to see all these different people using it.\n\nWell I have a lot of questions about your motivations going in and then what has actually happened since with the usage. I'll have to tell you last night I did install it. You know I got it was very simple process. I found it pretty elegant kind of it you you launch it and it's like oh I need to index and it's it's clearly doing a sync and there's a little bit of output which is itself kind of fun because I'm like come some real private messages of some close friends and then there's like crypto spam groups that I got added to I haven't left yet whatever and then there's like a group chat and it's you get a sense of like you're living your recent conversation just by looking the at the logs and then it's and then it's ready and it's clearly ready to be used. Of course, getting MCP set up with a client is a little bit of a technical exercise. Yes. But it worked perfectly. And then first thing I did was like summarize all my recent conversations. And there it was. You know, you know, you're on a crypto spam list and you looks like you're talking about this with these people and you know, breakfast with Luke tomorrow, whatever. And it was uh it was great. And I was a little scared to use it to send messages. I'm not a heavy user and I was um but I could tell like this is this is interesting. The simplicity of these things. a bunch of questions technically I guess for the motivations are like where is the data going you know when it's in my WhatsApp app and it's encrypted now I'm on MCP I've installed your thing it's part of it's running on my laptop part of it inferring in the cloud well no actually the only thing it's running is so it uses the WhatsApp device API so it speaks directly to WhatsApp okay and all your messages are on your computer they should be the exact same the off was a great step by the way the QR code that spits out the terminal that Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Worked great. I don't know how how a cursor did that, but it worked out. So, it's like at first it printed out a raw string and I was like, turn it into turn it into a QR code and it did. Just for people who don't know what we're talking about, you install the the server and run it, does its indexing, and then it literally prints on the terminal output a QR code and you scan and that's the O for WhatsApp. Okay. So now I have a secure connection and I'm connecting via that secure connection from my laptop directly to WhatsApp the uh browser WhatsApp web. Okay. Yeah. And then okay so then when I issue a query in in claude yes and it says okay I need to call this tool or do this MCP call what's happening then? Yeah. So the vast majority of read calls it's already got all the messages saved in this local SQL line and so it can just query and so the cool thing is like you know WhatsApp's very precious and fantastic service but you really don't want to get blocked by it and so you can do like as much querying as you want to this local SQL light bit and that's all local and then if when you come to send messages that's when it actually like fires back through WhatsApp web. There's a few other cool bits which is what about the info summarize my conversations are you taking all that SQLite cache and pushing it up to somewhere. So it's the way that the MTP interface works is you expose tools and so one of the tools is query my messages and it\n\n\nlike literally just you can pass in filters.\nSo it's like who's it from, date range, keywords, blah, blah, and all the and so your MTP client like Claude, Claude will write that query.\nYeah.\nIt will get those messages, but it just goes back to your Claude.\nSo Claude in the cloud though is going to compute on my website.\nIt does.\nSo those are the like trust factors.\nI have to trust, but you're actually specifying like, yes, run this query, and then it gets in returns it, and the step like I've left as an exercise to the reader is like you can make it fully secure by doing a like, instead of using Claude, you could use a local LLM, which then like they're never leaving your personal computer, but yes, at the moment it does, it does the messages you explicitly tell it to search, it will search and expose, of course.\nI'm jumping, jumping a couple steps ahead for a second.\nThe thing that I immediately saw from it going back to your original tweet around email, WhatsApp, and and calendar was to build a cloud or an MCP server.\nYes.\nOr client, sorry.\nI want to build a client in my server infrastructure that uses this MCP WhatsApp interface behind the scenes as part of an app that is providing a service.\nYes.\nYes.\nSo I want to automate my part of my WhatsApp interfacing with my community or my business or for my business as me.\nYes.\nNatively as me, but with agents.\nRight.\nSo what's that's why I actually built first.\nYeah.\nAnd so the way I built it is, um, I was, um, if you look at the code, we should look at the code.\nYeah.\nI can show you the code briefly.\nUm, so yeah, what you've got here, you've got this bridge, which is all the go files, and you've got the uh MTP server, and so these are all the Python files, and if you look, I've actually have an abstraction whereby what's py is all the like business logic, but then there's a very thin wrapper in main.py, which just takes each of the functions in WhatsApp.py Pi, adds a nice arg string, and adds a MTP.\nWhich is just like a Python line Python client to expose it.\nUm, but and what this does is it makes it very easy for your MTP clients to access your MCP uh tools.\nMhm.\nBut what's interesting about this MCP system is it's actually mainly set up for like human interaction in the loop doing approvals.\nI don't think really anyone's using MCP clients in a fully automated way, but why I've done it this way is you can actually um wrap all these WhatsApp WhatsApp.py tools and instead just expose them to any other LLM framework.\nSo another like experiment I did with this was you can connect it to the OpenAI agents SDK and you can just pass those in.\nSo I think the and then it's like a very clear, you know, it's like any agentic system can call it in the loop.\nSure.\nYeah.\nCool.\nWhich I mean makes sense.\nI don't want to always be in the loop for things that are clearly trivial.\nNo.\nNo.\nWhat what's quite nice is like where most of the usage is is exactly as you said, it's like people normally in group chats, often in places like um Brazil or India, where lots of like businesses or groups are running on it.\nSo you can imagine you have like a fitness WhatsApp group or a um voice AI WhatsApp group, and you want to basically like do a round up of all the messages of the last week.\nLike you can kind of run that exactly like someone like you who's a a tinkerer would probably actually like, okay, I've done that once, now how do I actually put that in the loop?\nYeah.\nYeah, it makes sense.\nAnd I want sort of something that's, you know, especially in WhatsApp, there's lots of groups I'm part of that I'm not going to be spending my entire day watching every thread, but occasionally there's a thread that breaks out that I definitely want to pay attention to.\nAnd what's very cool as well is like the advanced search.\nSo you could be you're in a bunch of WhatsApp groups and you're like, oh, like what's the uh coolest things happening about MTP or conversational AI?\nAnd you just ask it.\nIt will do the search and then do the round for you and then synthesize it all together.\nOne of the groups of mine is doing that.\nI'm wondering if they're using your MCP.\nIt may well be.\nBut the I mean the hard stuff truthfully is this what's meow bit under the hood.\nThis is I basically just done the nice.\nDo you worry about being blocked?\nUm, so I, you won't be blocked, the user of it will.\nYeah, the bit I need to add a risk spit to this um repo, but the um I think read is very, you know, pretty safe, and it's also if you think about the spirit of WhatsApp, it's like not actually going, you know, you're just reading your messages and querying your messages.\nI think the mass sending though, that is scary, and you should be careful if you're trying to do WhatsApp.\nI mean, some kind of highle conceptual view, these businesses, WhatsApp and etc. were designed for human interaction.\nYes.\nAnd you know, we may build agentic systems that use those pretending to be humans, but the business is disrupted, right at some level.\nSo, they're not going to like that or they're going to have to adapt.\nYes.\nAnd there's going to be a cat mouse.\nYou know, actually, two weeks ago, for the first time, you know, we've all seen lots of captures.\nI saw a crazy one.\nThis capture made me listen to three bits of sound and and tell what I was listening to.\nSo I was like, which one of the four clips is water running?\nI had to listen to four clips and choose ABC.\nAnd I had to do the exercise three times.\nTook forever to get through this caption.\nI can only imagine because of, you know, they obviously really don't want robots.\nNow robots are coming.\nWhat's what's going to happen with with all these wonderful What is this?\nI think I think first of all is if you think about the spirit of WhatsApp uh of MCP is like it is human in the loop.\nYeah.\nAnd so if you're say a business in Brazil and you're sending out invoices over WhatsApp, currently that's incredibly clunky, but now you could connect your WhatsApp MTP with your Salesforce MTP, and like you can actually there be orchestrating that.\nI I think your side note which is really interesting is like what actually does the future of communication look like in a world where AI is at par.\nUm, I personally really like where the world coin direction is going.\nI'm not sure if you've scanned your eyeball, but the it's some pretty cool privacy stuff of like you scan your eyeball, you uniquely prove that you are one human, and then that you could build a messaging protocol on top which is like, okay, what's a reasonable number of messages for a human to send?\nOkay, it's in the hundreds, but not the thousands.\nAnd then you can also like punish bad actors who are overly extending their their their message systems or sending spam.\nYeah, interesting.\nThere's something there.\nThere's, you know, clear trade-offs.\nI don't know if you're aware, but in the US, if you're on Global Entry system when you go back to the US from overseas, you walk up, it's the best experience of this genre that I know of.\nYes.\nLike you you don't I don't take off my glass or adjust my hat.\nI literally just look at the screen for a moment, a second, and it's like, \"Welcome back.\"\nI don't show any ID.\nI don't show anything.\nI don't scan a passport.\nIt's just face recognition.\nThe best implementation of it and it's a breeze and I love that.\nYeah, the the convenience of it.\nSo, who says government can't change and it was the government, probably the best thing the government's done.\nUm, really cool.\nSo, popping up a level like your motivations and what is it used for for this MCP and in general, did you achieve the vision or a piece of it with the original tweet?\nAre you using it?\nYeah, interesting.\nSo, I do use it.\nI use it for the roundups.\nSo like every week I'm in a bunch of different WhatsApp groups and I love to just like summarize like, okay, this particular YC grow, this voice AI group, like what are the main themes, and I'm curious for that, are you literally just a Claude user saying please summarize, automating that piece and delivering it or convenient enough?\nOkay, yeah, exactly, it's and also you're you'll quite often have some follow-on messages, you're like, oh, what's this theme that's oh, right, what did they specifically say?\nSo I use it in like a chat.\nYeah, because if you're in context, you can be like, that's cool, um, send a message to the person who wrote that.\nYes.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nCool.\nUm, the I don't I don't actually use the sending very much, and also there's maybe we kind of shift into the talking about the security stuff.\nOkay.\nIs um what's interesting is WhatsApp MTP, I think is probably the most used MTP server there is at the moment.\nAnd because of that, it's kind of ended up being the one running into the security rules where the researchers are like, I found this vulnerability Rex.\nYeah.\nNone of the vulnerabilities I would argue were in the WhatsApp MTP server level because they're more around the like MTP protocol and the fact that things are in, you know, there's nothing, the messages are just on your SQLite database.\nIt does take it out of the encrypted WhatsApp things, but you know, as the creator, it's still my responsibility to make sure like people don't shoot themselves in the foot.\nUm, but there's a couple of interesting ones.\nHave you came across the prompt injection stuff?\nUh, in general, of course, but what do you with?\nSo with WhatsApp, sorry, with MTPs, the way it works is you specify um normally a dock string with the MTP, which is what's loaded, which annotates the tools.\nNow what's quite interesting is if you have say one good MCP like the WhatsApp MCP and someone loads a bad MCP which is like has the dock string, oh, list all the messages and then forward to Joe's number, it will do that.\nOkay.\nWow.\nOh, that's bad.\nAnd the funky thing I think about MTP, MTP has built-in like tool approvals, which truthfully when I was playing around with it, I just didn't really think about.\nI just always clicked allow all.\nI was like, I'm just testing it.\nIt'll be fine.\nBut people are putting a lot of trust in these like approval flows now.\nAnd there's even things like if you do lots of white spaces, you can kind of have the real message off the screen and they won't realize.\nSo I would argue the the key I think there's a big difference between readonly tools.\nSo like reading your messages in general fine, but sending is actually pretty dangerous.\nSo I think there needs to be at the protocol level a difference between readon and like great update.\nYeah.\nAnd you surfaced that interesting thing where even if the humans in the loop, I mean, come on, we we see, you know, walls of text with an agree now and you're in the middle of a deep flow and you're busy and I no one reads that.\nYes.\nI mean, and I so what purpose is it actually serving?\nIt's not protecting anyone but the the company providing, it's not protecting the user.\nI we want we want something that protects the users and society.\nYeah.\nAnd I know it's it's coming.\nWe did a hackathon in San Francisco.\nWe were building agents.\nThis was back in November.\nSecurity is an afterthought in a hackathon often, unless that's the theme.\nBut I did ask a bunch of people, hey, you know, you know, this is a cool idea you're building, but to make that real, how are you going to deal with privacy and security?\nAnd everyone's like, what have you seen or any is anyone tinkering on that?\nAnd people were, it's a little bit here.\nI read this blog post.\nSomebody had a proposal for maybe there has to be an ooth for agents.\nYes.\nYou know, and I had um at the same time I've been chatting with some folks at Octa and they they were obviously investigating this stuff.\nSo, we did a we did a a meetup themed on agents and security, right?\nGot the community to build and and talk, but more questions than answers at this point.\nIt's very early.\nThere's an interesting thing whereby actually I think MCPs are, you know, if you think about this WhatsApp MCP, everything's on your own computer.\nIt's actually way more secure than the vast majority of cloud applications where the developer has read access to the DB.\nSo like what's pretty cool is it's kind of somewhat private by default and like a lot more than than lots of things.\nAnd when I was starting to think like, okay, how could actually do like a hosted version of this so you're not needing to like, you know, basically non-technical users can do it.\nSo you don't have to install Go.\nYes.\nYou don't have to install Go or or UV.\nUm, and what I landed on was what I would really love is a cloud environment which is like end to end encrypted on the user's behalf where you can execute the code.\nAnd I don't I don't think it's I mean this is still an early thought, but what's cool is when you run something in your own AWS or Azure or GCP, you have full control of the execution and the data.\nAnd I would love if um with MTPs there's some way where you almost have your own hosted environment that you fully run.\nYeah.\nThat you're like approving the updates that you do some reasonable pay rules.\nSo but the the meetup I mentioned that was security focus, the the top rated presenter.\nYes.\nUh was a a person um from a Tanya from a person company called Tinfoil.\nThey do this.\nYes.\nOh really?\nSecure end to end enclaves cryptographically secure to the hardware layer.\nThat's very cool.\nAnd with a co-founder from MIT is a world expert in that and knows everyone in that niche within PhD computer science and they're building the company on that.\nThey were a few months away from later I caught up with them.\nWe actually did an episode of One-Shot with Tony because it was so good to hear about this and that that seems to be the itch that they're scratching.\nI mean exactly what you described.\nYeah.\nAnd then uh we sat down to do the interview and they're like we just got into IC yesterday.\nIt was great timing.\nSo pulling full circle on a lot of these things.\nUm, yeah, that's an interesting interesting thing.\nI think either that or like could we just get running running running on smartphones?\nAnd actually the company I'd love, of course, the company I'd love to see the most just doing this is Apple because I think Apple has like everything set up for them, but um we're we're not there just yet.\nIt's a laugh.\nI mean, I I am frustrated using wonderful tools like Whisper and Super Whisper on my Mac to transcribe, and I'm addicted to that.\nWell, that's I\n\n\nUse it for everything. That maybe takes us nicely into the second hack I'd love to show. Well, now we got ElevenLabs getting in there, too. But yes, I and we will, but uh, I'm so addicted to using transcription in that modality now that I can't use Apple. It's terrible. No, the Apple cannot spell the word hackathon. Yes, Apple will take the word there and use the wrong version of it in a sentence. I know. It just an LLM can't even make that mistake. If you try to get, you spend more time like tapping around in the message to try and while you're walking, and it's terrible. No, let's talk about then let's go to the next topic. We're talking about voice now. So, um, I was literally ran into the exact issue we're talking about, and I haven't actually demoed this to Joe just yet. Um, so ElevenLabs, we have, we were initially famous for our text-to-speech models where we were the first company to cross this threshold of humanlike speech. We more recently ship the best speech-to-text model, which is the highest quality translation, and so what I, I was actually having lunch with my wife, and we're waiting for the bill, and I was like, \"How is iPhone dictation so bad?\" And I was like, \"Surely there's a way where I can just speak into it. I can transcribe it with ElevenLabs. I can then just like clean up the raw transcript and then paste it back in.\" And so what I thought was interesting, I was like, \"Oh, okay. How could I do that? Do I need to build an app?\" Do I was like, \"Well, Apple Shortcuts is the thing.\" Oh, yeah. How far can I push Apple shortcuts? So, the way I've set it up is all you do is you hold down the action button or you, Oh, you can assign that to be a shortcut. Okay, cool. So, you hold down the action button.\n\nHey Joe, really excited to do our podcast called Two Shot, sorry, One-Shot, uh, this coming week. Uh, can't wait to see you on Thursday. Ah, Friday. Can't wait to see you on Friday. Uh, best wishes, Luke. 10:00 a.m., not 9:00 a.m. And the way it works, you can see in the top right here, it's now processing that shortcut. It then uh, sends it to ElevenLabs, sends it to to uh, OpenAI to clean up the transcript, and then you can just paste it in. And here we've got, \"Hey Joe, really excited to do our podcast called OneShot this coming week. Can't wait to see you on Friday. Best wishes, Luke.\" And it's all cleaned up. Great communication. You can click send. Well, I'm going to definitely get that set up 'cause Siri is driving me crazy. The one, I mean, this is maybe a brief tangent, but like Apple Shortcuts is so powerful, and the the latest hack I've been trying to do is like, I realized, well, one is like, if you can just hold down the button, do a voice note, and then execute actions. Wow, that's powerful for so many follow-on tasks. The other really cool one though is the um, vision models have got so good, like why not hold it down that triggers a shortcut which takes a screenshot, sends that to an LLM to work out the next step. So you basically have this like full context super smart AI assistant. That's a good idea. So you could do like, we're chatting, you're like, ah, I need it to draft your reply. You just hold it down, takes the screenshot, does the reply for you, paste it back in. You know, the apps that'll do a long screenshot of a scroll all the way. So imagine that. Now I'm giving the LM the context, and then I'm the voice of instruction. Hey, take this page, make an email to this, send it to Luke Harris, ask him a couple questions about the blog post. That would be, maybe we should hack that 10 minutes after. But honestly, you, you could, the only trick I don't know if you can get that long screenshot in most apps. It only seems some apps actually that. But even the stuff on the screen is probably enough, probably enough for most cases. You could always zoom out or pinch to zoom. One, one other side point is I worked out that uh, chat GPT can actually generate Apple shortcuts. Yeah. Um, and there's, there's an annoying bit whereby you have to sign it. So you have to generate it on your Mac. You then have to run a sign command, but then if you click the link, you then have it instantly loaded in your Mac and in your phone. Yeah. Nice. And what's cool about Apple Shortcuts as well is that exact workflow I just showed you on my phone. work. It works on your Mac. That's cool. And it's super cheap because it's just raw API usage. Yeah. Love it. I think I don't think people are familiar with the speech-to-text that ElevenLabs. That's rather new, right? Yes. I have a, I have a curious question. I admit I haven't tried it yet. Um, I've done long transcriptions on videos and diarization and all the bits. Just I wonder if you just quickly go through. So some of the limitations of just using something open source like Whisper are actually like context length. Yes. Or Gemini. Gemini is great uh, on um, input tokens. Yeah. Not output. So you can't just say, here's a two-hour video, give me the whole transcript. It'll stop halfway. Yeah. Do you break through that? Yeah. 100%. And the, the interesting thing, particularly for something like this with podcast transcripts, is small errors compound dramatically because it will shift the output um, such that like, it will end up, if it makes a mistake early on, often it'll be misaligned. and then for the entire podcast, and you have to like go through. So yeah, we built the world's best speech-to-text model called Scribe, and um, it still beats, I think OpenAI released a new model recently, still beats it, still beats Gemini. Do you do diarization, which is for those who don't know, delineating of the different speakers? Yeah. So it does diarization, excellent diarization. Also does character level timestamps. Cool. So that you can like, Yeah. lip sync and you can do apps on that. So you can do character level, word level. So if you're thinking like Joe's podcast lets you do an automated pipeline to make caption style videos, like it's fantastic for doing that. Can I give it a bag of terms like custom brand names and technical terms to hint the the AI? Yeah. Yeah, but actually it does. It gets words like ElevenLabs, right? One of my colleagues is called Thor. His full name is Thorston. It gets words like that straight out of. We have to definitely try it for this transcript. What about um, in the diarization? Do you, can you use the LLM to in natively in in the One-Shot context to figure out the names of the speakers in context? I think that's done after. I think it just says the speaker name. I need to double check. A number and ID. Hi Luke. And then you speak and it knows that you're Luke, right? I'm, I'm not sure we have that built. Maybe we should. We most likely should. It's a convenience thing for developers. Yeah, maybe built into the SDKs could be a pretty cool one. Character level timestamps and it's accurate. That's good. The other cool thing is it does audio events. So it does like laugh, it does cough, it does blahy blah. So say you want to like orderedly automatically extract any coughs, you could. Yeah. Oh, that's really cool. Oh wow. To get rid of them, right? So you can do jump cutting essentially on that level. Yeah, I've noticed a lot of the the time stamping on some of the others aren't that accurate, and so your subtitles won't exactly match the words, and therefore you can't do automated jump cuts. The other cool thing about this was um, the way we trained it, like actually lots of, we speak English, we're fluent in English. We're very lucky to be in English because if you're a different language, like a more niche language, lots of transcription just doesn't support you. So any sort of conversational AI, any sort of transcription, medical transcription, none of those will work. And when we built this model, we were the first one to make transcription actually feasible in massive languages like Gujarati or Malay or Serbian. And it's like suddenly if you were this say medical transcription app, you're like, \"Oh wow, my TAMs got bigger. I can now like launch an entire Serbian sales team, and we're the only people to actually have Serbian support.\" Yeah. Cool. Um, I'd love you to show us the conversation AI API stuff. I don't think most people are familiar with that. And voice agent stuff is really blowing up right now. It's super exciting. I think the people just haven't connected the dots that like actually no, the best text to speech. That's best and fast as well, natural, etc. Is actually you can compose this into useful apps today. Yeah. With actually no coding. No. But there's also an interface to Could you walk us through to show? It's amazing. And if you're interested for a fun tidbit, when I first started ElevenLabs, Matty laid out this big vision, and he was like, \"Yeah, one of the things we're going to do is uh, conversational AI or voice AI agents.\" And I was like, \"Never work. The latency is too high.\" He's like, \"Well, I think let's just give it a few months.\" And yeah, I was completely wrong. Just saying. Yeah, it makes a huge difference. What is the What is the number of milliseconds of delay that you need to achieve to get a reply back that feels human? Yeah. What's interesting about this? Well, I think there's like the concrete numbers is like it needs to be really less than a second. Sure. But if you think about what customers actually want, like the job to be done of certain calls, there's certain, there's different types of calls with companion apps. Super important at it. Low latency, super like emotional, imagining, and like we're doing lots of work on that side. Cool. Um, which we haven't seen out yet. Uh, no. No. Uh, we've got new models in the works. Research timelines are always hard, but yeah. Yeah, there's, there's more coming. But I mean, we're already powering um, some pretty big, some p pretty big companion apps. So, latency, realism, emotion. These are all important for conversational and and interactive trust. Building trust. Yeah. But the other angle as well is like loads of people use it in a business context. So, say customer support or sales. And actually what you want is normally like a quick reply, which is like, let me look into that for you. But then it's really almost about like the rag bit, and actually normally with a customer support call, um, what you're trying to do is like solve the user's problem. Yeah. And there what you care about is like overall time to solve their problem more so than that first. But you still need both. Yeah. If I'm going to do a really good quality answer. Yes. I don't expect a human to have the answer instantaneously. Go off and do a little thinking. We look some stuff up, you know, and then come back and multi- aent uh, rag retrieval. Yeah, we'll do, you know, obviously multiplex and a judgment and a report gen and then summarization, and that's the part that's spoken and maybe ask a question, then give me the rest interactively. It's almost like there has to be a few threads going, and one is like the I'm in the moment with you, conversing with you, has to be attentive, quick, friendly, you know, while also background processing, yes, the retrieval. So are you, do you, you first of all, the system that you've built, does it expose that to me? Oh, okay. So I can system prompt what this is first level interaction will be like, and I can go kick off some background stuff, come back and push it into the cont. So we have a fully integrated rag pipeline where you can actually like chuck in, you know, huge number of documents, and then we do all the rag stuff for you. But kind of zooming out, what why we built this is we end up, we work with like lots of small customers as well as some of the biggest enterprises in the world like Perplex or Time magazine, and we literally had about 20 customers over the space of two months saying, great, we're taking your text to speech, and we're taking speech to text, we're merging those together with term making model, like, have you got any tips for latency and blog and about the 20th time of helping people implement this, we were like, okay, let's like put it together, put together. And the, the bit we're trying to do is we, we have like two modes you can use it. One which is like hardcore engineer mode, which is like, I just want ElevenLabs to do all the voice stuff. So we do voice in turn taking, but you're the brain, and it's literally just like web hooks or websockets um, to handle the like, and it, it abstracts it all to text in text out. So let's say you're a big enterprise, you spend, you have a thousand person engineering team building, building out all your text-based solutions. You can very quickly wrap this, and suddenly you have a voice system. And then the other bit is we have the much more feature complete version where you can do proper rag and we have emails. But yeah, I can show you, talk you through some of that. Yeah, I almost think of that other case. The simpler one is like something that SMB might use, like I've Yeah. We've got a WordPress blog and a knowledge base, and like your tools makes it super easy just to kind of like load up a rag. Yes. Personality, define an agent, and then actually ship it with JavaScript on the website. Yeah. Right. All of it. It's pretty cool. I built, I built a couple last night. Oh, nice. Yeah. What did you build? Well, I built an AI Tinkerers frequently asked questions, you know, and it was, I have to admit, there's a little bit of tuning. Yes. needed, you know, in the system prompt and that I didn't quite because I, I, I put out our frequently asked questions. I don't know if you've read, it's very specific. It's very opinionated. Yes. You know, and there's all the best communication. This question questions like, you know, literally like, you know, I'm a Harvard MBA. I sold my company for 500 million. I'm not technical, but I've got a groundbreaking idea, and I would be a real asset to the community. I'm super well connected. I just want to go and you should make an exception for me. And it's like, no. Yes. And then so I\n\n\nBuilt an agent with that whole repo of like questions, and I asked that question or something similar, and it was like, \"Well, maybe you might be of value to us. Let's see, why don't you, why don't we try once?\" And it was like, \"No, you know,\" and so it made me feel like there's some rag tuning that either I have to do or something. And you have full access to the system prompt to do that.\n\nYeah, that's... did you, by the way, did you integrate client tools as well? I looked at the web hook before that, and I thought about it, and I think if I did that, I'd get exactly what I want.\n\nWell, there's... Yeah. Well, actually, I was thinking, so I think you should be able to solve your problem just through the system prompt because it's the... you can select any model. You could do Anthropic, you can do Gemini, you can do uh, open it. You know what I did with the system prompt? So rather than actually solve the problem I described, is I was like, \"Okay, now I want you to spell every word in a Boston accent.\"\n\nI used an ElevenLabs like gruff voice, and I tried to make it... the voices are amazing finding a voice.\n\nWell, Joe, you should clone your voice genuinely and use that. We can actually demo. I've got my voice in this platform.\n\nWell, you know, I have a lot of emails for the organizers that are that are me that aren't me. Yeah. Yeah. I... and I'm sure we'll get into, but the... to show you the um, it's a pretty cool demo. I'll just show you if you want, which is uh, and then we can jump into how you build these after. Is there's actually two modes of tools. We have like server-side tools. Yeah. Um, but we also have client-side tools, and so this can run uh, execute JavaScript on your behalf or like...\n\nCool. Well, it just returns which tool to use and the args, but like you can have it do stuff like switch the page. So you can be like, \"Oh, I'd love to go to a meet up in Mort.\" And it'll like take you immediately to the page. And then it goes, \"Great, like give me a quick summary of yourself.\" And then it could like prefill the entire thing for you. Yeah. Which could be pretty cool. But just to show people that one. Um,\n\nHey there, I'm Alexis from ElevenLab Support. How can I help you today?\n\nYeah. Hey Alexis. Um, can you tell me more about conversational AI?\n\nSure thing. ElevenLabs conversational AI is a platform that allows you to deploy customized conversational voice agents. It combines speech-to-text language models to speech, and can you tell me a bit more? Can you show me the the client-side tools?\n\nOkay, I can tell you more about client-side tools. Client tools enable your assistant to execute.\n\nPerfect. And now, now actually take me to the page or sending... Oh, take me to the page.\n\nDo you want to be taken to the documentation page about client-side tools?\n\nYeah.\n\nIs this part baked in with the JavaScript widget, the the navigation aspect, or do I have to build that? Um, I think I maybe the tricky... where it's still... Let me just get it.\n\nYes. Take me to the page.\n\nLet's see. There we go. And that's jump to the jump to the actual page. Um, I'll end that. Cool. Yeah, I think I'm not sure. We definitely have in our code uh, in our docs, we actually have that how to implement that. Okay. So, you can just grab it and paste it in. I think we do probably a little bit of asking you to do that bit in case you want to do certain things.\n\nThis is the exciting thing for me. I've thought a lot about the platform we built for AI Tinkerers has so many functions from invoicing and scheduling and emails and screening and data, and that why build more UI? It's just getting more complex if I can expose the primitives through tools to something like that, you know, our users are familiar with what's available, and if they have a good experience, I think they'll quickly ask to do the right things, right, if that makes sense?\n\n100%. 100%. Um, very interesting, and it's, you know, voice is the best mobile app experience if you really have a great one. That's smart. 100%. Um, I'll just show very briefly to create one. Um, what you can do is you can name your agent. So say we've got... we'll do a... should we do a AI tinker? We can try and do a quick... well, we'll do... we'll do a support agent. Maybe bring in a bit of AI tinker stuff in it. Sure. Um, and then you click create, and straight away there, you actually have a support agent which is ready to go. Mhm. You can select the voice. So, should we try doing it with my voice?\n\nCarries. Um, so I did my own voice clone recently, which is pretty fun. Um, and then, \"Hi, I'm Luke from Eleven Labs. Luke Harris from Eleven Labs support.\" Um, and you'll just... I'm just entering this information into the system prompt and the first message. Uh, you can also do, as we discussed, like client-side tools. You can do a end call. So at the end of the call, it sends... um, oh yeah, sorry, gives the ability to end the call, but you can also do like a web hook when a call ends, you can send transcript your own own knowledge base. Nice. Um, and then any other bit... I think that's probably... oh yeah, here's the widget if you want to add it to your own site, and we didn't talk about that. You can import a Twilio number. So you get a number on Twilio. There's some O workflow that makes it easy to put in.\n\nThat's exactly. And you can do both inbound calls, you can do outbound calls. We have batch batch outbounding calls. So, say you wanted to ring up all the people going to the AI thing tonight to give them, get them hyped for it. Sure. I think... well, for like the VIP dinner uh, experience, I think it's a better way. And you could do a quick interview like, \"Hey, you know, what are some topics that you'd like to talk about?\" And just stream that through back to the sponsor with a summary. I'm going to build that. That's what I'm doing on the building that on the airplane when I go back.\n\nThe the other cool thing is what I really love about voice is it's so much quicker for data collection and so much easier. Do you imagine if we had done this podcast and it was just in a Google doc taking us hours, so much more boring? Instead, you could phone people ahead of time. What the topics top of mind? What are the things you... How could you be helped out during this dinner and then like synthesize that, match make everyone...\n\nI'm I'm pretty bullish on the emotional stuff. I can't wait for that from ElevenLabs. And you know, there have been some other experimental things, and even back in the day, I don't know if you remember um, uh, what wasn't it was Tortoise? Do you remember Tortoise?\n\nYes.\n\nYeah. I mean, Tortoise was incredible. Yes. Before ElevenLabs. Yeah. That was a step change too. Yes. And it was you were able to do emotional stuff if you gave it inputs. For me, that was just exciting. But when you're talking about like engaging a human to like provide a bunch of useful information, that engagement is super important for conversion, right? Yeah. So, I'm I'm really excited about that. You can definitely achieve it with ElevenLabs by cloning, but if we're promptable on that stuff, I think it's a game changer. Yeah. Yeah. Hope some cool stuff in the works. And just to show you my own voice clone, and your audience may see enjoy seeing the um, quality of the voice clones as well.\n\nYeah. \"Hey there, I'm Luke Harries from ElevenLab support. How can I help you today?\"\n\n\"Hey Luke, uh, I'd like you to help me. Can you tell me a bit more about conversational AI, or actually, what is text to speech? Tell me what is text to speech?\"\n\nAll right, I can definitely help with that. Text to speech or TTS is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. It's basically what allows read text aloud.\n\nUm, so that that works. And then what we can do is jump back, and if we click on uh, this top right, we should be able to go to conversation history for this agent. And then you can see the full transcript. It gives a summary of it. You can also write your own evals as well. So like, let's say someone like... well, the evals, they're actually just questions and prompts. So you can say like, \"I'd like to extract this information and grab it all.\" And and then it can... you can define like success, and so you have evals built into the system when you're... that's amazing, that's incredibly useful, and you're running the evals and you're evaluating the eval output.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And the way I would... I mean, that's cool. The interesting thing about people are often asking me about voice evals. My contrarian take is like, largely, you know, it is getting better, the turn taking and the interruption and those bits, but like I think the vast majority of the evals you need to do is actually around the LLM and the brain, and I think most of the just normal like text platforms is where where the kind of eval should be doing, and also then it's so much cheaper, so much quicker, you're not doing all the like voice invoice output that makes total sense. Fact, you'd probably want to partition those at scale.\n\nYes. Yeah. Um, so we talked about latency. You're already a really pretty dang fast. In fact, I met a someone... oh gosh, uh, hipp... hypocrat... hypocratic. Yeah. So uh, founder there um, did a meet up in Palo Alto for AI Tinkerers and showed his... this at the time, this is a year and a half ago. Okay. And it was definitely the fastest voice, and I was pretty deep on all the things open source and different, including ElevenLabs. And when he showed that, I was like, \"This is the best I've seen in terms of naturalness, speed.\" I was like, and so we asked him what he was using. And when he said ElevenLabs, I was surprised. Yes. I was like, \"What?\" Because I was that familiar with the latencies that I was like, \"You must have a special.\" He's like, \"Oh, yes, we have a... you know, we got this is a long time ago.\" But clearly all that that speed has come to the platform because it's it's just as fast now. Um, so we talked about latency, how important it is. We haven't talked about... we talked about expressiveness. Sounds like you got stuff coming. I won't press you on it to get you in trouble.\n\nUm, turn detection. Uh, what are you doing there? That seems like a really important one, too.\n\nYeah, we've just shipped a new um, so we're releasing very soon our like conversational AI 2.0, which is there's been a whole bunch of new features we've shipped, namely the built-in rag and the better term taking model, and what we've moved to is our own custom model which feeds in two layers of input. So one is voice and audio. Mhm. Um, and the other is um, like semantic word level. So what's quite interesting... partic... I do this thing where most weekends I walk around a park and I speak to our conversational AI system and I get it to help me like reflect on my week. Cool. Um, and with the first couple of versions, it's like, \"What was the... you know, what was the highlight of your week?\" And you're like, \"Yeah, great question.\" And then it goes, \"Luke, are you still that?\" You're like, \"No, I'm like, I'm trying to think, like, clearly I'm still thinking.\" But you know that from like the semantic word layer of it.\n\nGood.\n\nThat's a huge improvement.\n\nYeah, I know that feeling. It's attention. Yes. It's worked for me to kind of keep the AI to be with me. I got really good at saying uh, and then it wouldn't interrupt. It's like walking. It feels like walking a dog. It's not quite trained. You have to be too much in the moment. Yeah. But no, that that could be solved. That's wonderful to hear. Okay. Talking about the go back to popping up to ElevenLabs, the tremendous growth. I can imagine early on that a lot of it was just tinkering and playing, and it's like almost like a new form of entertainment to use voices and AIs and interact with them. Yeah. But now we've got clearly people using it for customer support. What are the growth drivers right now? What are the actual real-world use cases where you're seeing, you know, is it the stuff that I would expect to hear, support? Are there any unexpected modes that are interesting?\n\nThe one which I think is really surp...\n\nYeah. So the obvious ones are like support and sales. Yeah. The one which I think is really surprising is education. Oh yeah. Because I think for years in like the tech VC space, just no one view... no one view education companies as um, like actually venture-backed investable businesses. But what's fascinating is as soon as you start integrating proper AI and voice, the quality level improves so much. You can deliver on so much more. you can like properly have a like hourlong experience or or get way better at language learning.\n\nDoes that look like people just using it directly as consumers or or baking it into education platforms as a mode?\n\nSo for us, we with our conversational AI is nearly always we sell to businesses who create these incredible end experiences. So an example would be chess.com. So they have an app with Professor Wolf which will give you like interactive chess lessons and speak you through it. So that's a really cool one. There's another one like a whole bunch of the language learning apps are using us. Um, so like Practica is one example, but some of the biggest use us and like creating properly interactive uh, things. And my wife is French. I've spent thousands of pounds, yeah, thousands of dollars having like one-on-one French lessons, and every time it was like, \"Oh, you need to be there at a certain time, their internet's bad,\" and blah blah blah. And now it's just like on demand, you have a fantastic French tutor. You know, I think the quality of the education we all have experienced with the models, the quality of the conversational is not quite there yet. in terms of experiencing it like I think that these things we talked about latency, turn detection, emotional, especially are going to be a game changer, whatever we've all experienced with these tools so far. Yeah, it's a whole other standard deviation of like consumption that will happen in my opinion, and I say that partly because of um, some of the other things that you've seen, you know me... I mean, I'll mention Sesame only because I know they've come to your meetup, the AI Tinkerers.\n\n\nMeet up in London, which didn't say Luke is now the organizer for AI Tinkerers London. Yeah, I'm honored. Big shoes to fill. Louis did a fantastic job. So, we've had the founder of ElevenLabs coming to that meetup for a while. We have the founder of the other founder of ElevenLabs lives in my end of the world in Bellevue, Washington. Yes, and comes to the Seattle meetup. Um, but that system kind of blew my mind.\n\nOmutionality, I think, was the the the best I'd experienced before they cut it down to, like, I think you get two minutes. When they first launched, it was an hour. And I had hourlong, wow, conversations with this thing, multiple driving, working out where I'm getting entertained. I'm genuinely laughing. Yeah. Like the content's just, you know, where they're using Gemma, you know, Google's open source model, right? But because the voice emotional response is so adapting to me and engaging. Yeah. It's it it it's going to lead to, like, a few things. One is this uptick in usage, I believe. Yeah. That once you experience that, it's there's no going back. And therefore, for this case of, like, chess education or anything, it's going to be that much deeper and better. And then two is, like, this hard to predict, but, like, in the same way that social media became addictive and took over, and maybe is not the best thing, AI companions are are real. This is happening. What's what's interesting is, I would argue at the moment, AI is the only modality that can actually make you feel something. Yeah. So it can, like, really make you laugh. It can make you cry. It can make you scared. The if I'm not sure if you've heard of any of our ASMR voices, but they properly give you the tingle on your neck. Well, as I don't have that yet for AI poetry, AI short stories, AI images. I think that will come, but that that's very cool. And yeah, it's just going to get better, better, and better. Um, there's a Yes. Yeah. Fascinating, fun. I'm sure you've played with the music products, the sound generators. Yes. I don't know if that's an area that you guys have. I'm sure you've thought about it. Yeah. Uh, endless entertainment on those, of course, which is I think most of the comes from must be just personal fun and friends, but I've tried to use those systems to actually just create dialogue. Have you done this? No, I haven't done that. What what have you done? So, instead of prompting for music, prompt and be very specific in your prompt, like, standup comedy routine, small club, microphone, crowd noise, you know, and have it try to generate comedy. Wow, that's very cool. Yeah. The interesting thing is, if you think about audio, Yeah, as a modality, like you do end up, so we currently have, like, a sound effects model. We have a text-to-speech model. We have, but I could definitely imagine a world of, like, more and more becoming, you know, one. I mean, to digress slightly, if you think about audio books and what is an audio book? It's normally one person reading out an entire book with no special effects, no sound effects, and only one character, like you're listening to Harry Potter with Steven Fry playing both teenage Hermione and teenage Harry Potter. Um, and the future, which I could really imagine is particularly of audio books, is, like, and we're trying to build this with our studio product. You feed in a PDF and it goes, okay, these are all the different people. Okay, this is where we should have, like, suspense music and this particular sound effect. And I think that's really exciting for just audio overall. Yeah, it is. You think about sometimes you see museums have done that with their audio thing, and there are audio dramas, but they're so rare and the production, the cost of production is crazy, and then it's not that good, actually. Yeah. Yeah. So, you kind of tragic because they, you know, they spent a lot and it's not that good. Yeah. Yeah, it's not Hollywood. There's there's an interesting thesis we have, which is the creator will become the consumer. So, currently, lots of people spend hours and hours, like, manually creating these audio books. Um, and I think that will work for, like, the real big blockbusters with the fantastic, um, with, like, when you get a voice like Steven Fry, but I think more and more it will move to, like, the end user having content dynamically generated on the fly, like exactly they're like, I love this voice and this voice in my language, you know, so it's uh, Serbian, and then it's just, like, generated live for you. Mhm. Yeah, that'll be that'll be fun. It's it's great to see that. And so, so automated, so you could have it your cake could eat it too. Um, so we've seen, you know, the rise of of these systems. Any unexpected use cases where you're like, yeah, people using ElevenLabs in this way we never anticipated? I'm just continually amazed by how big companies are being built on conversational AI because if you think about the number of jobs which are, um, like answering the phone, and so one example, hotel receptionist in Guatemala, apparently you can build a massive business building AI just for hotel receptionist in Guatemala because currently they're spending hundreds of dollars per month on a hotel receptionist per hotel. Yeah. And so the the biggest surprise is pretty much every single niche, whether it's, like, dental clinic receptionist, whether it's customer support, whether it's sales, like, every niche of every country of every industry. If you I think if you just go really deep in it, you could build a massive business because the amount which is currently spent and then you use, like, that as your wedge into all the other tools and workflows and becoming system of record. That's amazing. I have to say, like, I think for my tinkering in Gen AI and things being so amazing, um, and so much experimentation happened, this was very early on. I think ElevenLabs was also the first where the whisper rumor numbers of the revenue growth. Yes. Was it was the first case where I was like, felt enormous sense of relief because the number was large. This was a few years ago now, you know, very early before I mean, now we talk about cursors revenue and everybody brags about their revenue, but it was before anything and it was a whisper number and I was very relieved. It's like, great, there's there's there's going to be big businesses in the space. Yes. Um, and I'm sure just from what you described, it's continued.\n\nUm, let's see how switching gears really quick, and I know this is going pretty long. I don't know how much time you have before we wrap, but back to your the start of this conversation, you know, you're a renaissance background, right? And so you're not just an engineer, obviously, but you have this ML piece, engineering, growth, product, entrepreneurship. Um, what are the meta ways in which you use AI throughout all those things? Yeah. So, I've talked to some people around their meta workflow. You know, how do you go from customer input to, like, shipped code and and BRD, PRD, if you want to call it that, or yeah, what is your, you know, because I think I find that people like you have are using AI, you AI first, AI native. Yeah. What are those tricks you workflows interesting? We've set up more and more of this recently. One I've been really surprised how useful it is is Gong. So, we have a sales team. We're constantly doing these sales calls, and every sales call there's just, like, an absolute gold mine of, like, user wants, user needs, objections, uh, competitor analysis, where you falling flat, etc. There's so many of the and we have now tens of sales people all gathering all these tens of sales people making tens of cool hours of data, and what we've set up with Gong is you uh, it automatically analyzes all the transcripts post the call for particular threads and pulls them out. So the say conversational AI team has a constant thread of just, like, for every single call, this is, like, the areas of weakness that we need to fix, and then that goes into the road map. Um, that I think there's definitely more we could do in terms, like, the I can envision a something that's agent that's looking at your codebase and that that it's like, it's literally a 24/7 dynamic road map. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there's this interesting thing of, like, if you view software engineering as a system or as a factory, like, what goes in, user wants and needs, what goes out, ship code, and, like, in the middle, you have different people doing different parts, shaping different things. I don't think we're yet, you know, at the level where we're we're fully automating all, but maybe to name a few other tidbits of, like, processes we've, so one is we've done that, and the other one is then, like, okay, we actually sign up a user, they have a great case study, then we now have this great case study flow, which is we do a half an hour call with them using granola, with their permission, we then take the granola and paste that into a clawed project with previous examples, what makes a great great case study, etc., and then that outputs first shot, like, it's 95% of the way there, an excellent case study, and you're able to get that because you're feeding in that rich granola set of those. Cool. And that's going on the blog as a case stud. Yeah. Yeah. That then goes on case study, and it will also say, like, we suggest you add this picture, and then that goes to our to our team. That's great. It pains me to think of all the people who are wanting case studies or producing them in some not AI native way. I know. And to hear how simple that is, right? Yes. is is great. The I mean, I actually just shipped today, just before this call, like, a chat GPT, which is trained on our tone of voice and tweet threads and everything, and I said all new external customer coms has to go through this because it will, like, align it, touch it up, make, make sure it's all on brand. Perfect. What do you use for generation at the end of the day? Which M Gemini or And that one I actually, we have a chat GPT team subscription and you can just ship GPTs within it. Okay. And so that felt like a great way open AI. Um, other bits we do, we do, I mean, code, the entire team is in on cursor. Um, I think there's a big opportunity for oh, I mean, for all our marketing videos, we use ElevenLabs speech tech text to speech. We also use sound effects a lot, like sound effects is probably the most underrated model for marketing and video use cases.\nUm, yeah. Yeah, ElevenLabs. Yeah, 100%. Uh, one thing I'm not sure if you've seen is we've shipped a soundboard as well. Have you seen this? Uh, let me just turn back on my screen. ElevenLabs. Soundboard. Uh, where you can, like, actually looks pretty amazing. Uh, one of the engineers built this in a week, but you can, like, Oh, I'm gonna back up the audio. But, um, it's like, it looks beautiful. It's styled on some of Brawn stuff, and you can assign any sound effects to it and keys and stuff. I can imagine for video games it's going to be great. You know, I don't know, like, some of the biggest budget video games that have ever been created. I'm thinking Grand Theft Auto. Yes. Have you ever noticed all the car horns are the same horn? It's like, for all of the realism, the horn is, like, for every car. I think I think gaming is going to change completely. I mean, one, you have that. Two, um, like, conversational AI characters in games. It's going to be amazing. Walk up to character, live conversation. It's going to create new genres of games that we haven't even thought about. It's going to be, and the part which is real really wacky is, like, what does an AI first game engine look like in the world of, like, Sora, Sora and Bo? I think it's going to change completely. It's gonna be amazing. Well, let's try to move to wrap up a little bit. I'm really curious kind of more rapid fire style, like, how do you keep up with the rapidly changing landscape? What are your go-to resources? My main thing is Twitter. Y Twitter, Hacken News is fantastic. And then Swix has a AI daily newsletter, which Yeah, I I read that. Y um, yeah, cool. Um, what about how did you first hear of AI Tinkerers? AI through I I hosted the first Langchain meetup in London. Oh, okay. Couple of years ago, and Louisie the month after hosted the first AI Tinkerers, and I was like, actually, that one's better. So I was like, why why run my own when I can just attend Louis, and then yeah, came full circle of now have the honor of hosting the London one. It's a pretty good group. I I have to tell you a story about Louis. I I I get a lot of inbound from the email list of different things, you know, and opportunities. And someone was like a VC that looked pretty pretty legit though, you know, in the background. Like, we don't really let VCs into our meetup. Yes. But, you know, sometimes it's useful as a sponsor to help connect to a venue, whatever. So, I was like, fine, I'll introduce them to Louie, you know, in London. So, I did the intro and Louis reply was like, it's on the website now, but it's like, it's like, hi, I'm sorry that this is the response to, like, I'm introducing you to this person. It's like, hi, I'm really sorry. I know you don't want to hear this, but, you know, we've never let a VC into our meetup ever, including the ones on my own cap table. Sorry. Goodbye. Yeah. Said a great line, which is the reason why it's the best uh, best AI meetup in London is it's because the least inclusive club within bounds, like, you want it very inclusive. We are very we are very inclusive of engineers, of builders. Yes, we I was talking to one of our builders in in the um in Warsaw yesterday. He's one of the most creative, incredible. He was the first one who did, like, an ambient AI desktop system that I've ever seen and just an incredibly brilliant creative hacker. Um, and he had tweeted something that kind of went semiviral in some of these circles that was like, you know, VC DMs on Twitter, like, &quot;Oh, Robert, I've been following you and you know, I'm really impressed with, you know, this about, you know, this thing, your product.&quot; And he's he's like, &quot;Oh, really? What exactly was impressive? Yeah. So perfect. I thought, you know, it is it is a thing where I think you create this safe space for tinkers to actually be vulnerable. Yes. It's scary, like you said, launching your personal project. You've got a lot tied into it and you know, it's you don't\n\n\nDon't you want help?\nYou don't want yes.\nYou know, uh, where can people find your work, your personal blog, the ElevenLabs stuff we talked about?\nCan you share some links so I can post?\nBut if you want to...\nSo the main place would be, yeah, elevenlabs.io.\nYou don't need to sign up.\nYou can just type in, trout speak to our voice agent.\nAnd then my own blog is harry's.co.\nI'm on Twitter, Luke Harris.\nUm, yeah, if you want, I've wrote a few blog posts recently.\nOne which is quite, maybe quite interesting to tinkerers, which is like how to launch your product.\nYeah, where I've like literally done the Google sheet of how we launch our product here.\nAmazing.\nAnd I think the so many people are building like so many cool demos and actually that like last 20% of if you can like push it out there, like the WhatsApp MTP...\nI hope you won't mind me saying, I got this one hilarious email which was, \"Hey Luke, uh, really enjoyed your WhatsApp MTP.\nI always wish there was a local version of WhatsApp I could query locally.\nI wish I built it when I was there.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Oh, who is this guy, Yan?\"\nI like Google him.\nIt's like turns out he's the founder of WhatsApp.\nSo, like all these cool moments don't happen unless you like actually launch it and push it out there.\nBuild, push it out there.\nIncredible things happen.\nYeah.\nWell, thank you so much, Luke.\nFantastic.\nThanks so much, Joe.\nThank you.\n",
