  "cleanText": "The entire world is going to pivot from deterministic processes to non-deterministic agentic process. That's what's going to happen. I'd say probably seven out of 10 processes that have ever been built will be augmented, rewritten, enhanced with AI agents to be more non-deterministic or agentic. If you're that business that believes that you can operate successfully without agentic or non-deterministic agentic processes, you are wrong. You will be the blockbuster video of the modern era. We humans have to take control of this situation. And what I mean is AI. It's wonderful that Sam and his band of merry women and men as well as Anthropic and you know a couple other companies are marching towards AGI. Well, that doesn't mean that we have to live in a world defined by Sam Altman. In fact, I refuse to live in a world defined by a dude named Sam.\n\nWelcome to DataFramed. This is Richie. In the last few months, a lot of CEOs have given public statements about transforming their company to be AI first. As cutting edge as that sounds, today's guest started that journey years ago, and they've already written a book about it, namely Digital Impact. I want to find out what he learned. From previous data framed episodes on organizational transformation, a recurring theme has been that buying technology is the easy part. The tricky parts are changing your processes and retraining your staff. So today we're going to learn about the human element of AI transformation as well as the practicalities of building enterprise AI. Our guest is Steve Lucas, the CEO at Boomi and former CEO at Marketo. Boomi is building an integration platform as a service business, which is a fancy way of saying it's software connecting all your enterprise systems together. Coincidentally, this is an essential step for building enterprise AI agents. With so many executives blowing hot air about AI, I'm really excited to speak to someone who's actually transforming their business with it. Let's hear Steve's story.\n\nHi, Steve. Welcome to the show.\n\nThanks, Richie. It's good to see you and glad to be here.\n\nYeah. Uh great to chat with you. Now I want to pick up on something you said in your book that it doesn't matter whether you choose SAP or Oracle, Microsoft, Google for your enterprise stack. The choice of technology B doesn't matter. Uh talk me through why do you say that?\n\nNone of those companies are terrible companies. That was the the main point. Maybe that got lost. They're all great technologies, but to a certain degree, all of those companies want to obligate you as a company to their stack. That if if that's a shock, like welcome to software. That's the way it's been forever. But it it's that kind of stack obligation that I think starts to rotate all organizations that I've ever worked with in my 30 years into a bad place, right? We end up choosing this whole like best of breed argument, right? We choose that versus, you know, kind of like best stack. And my view is, you know, choose what's best for your business. That's that's the view.\n\nOkay. I guess that's kind of good that we're not just alienating like all the major tech players all at once. Uh but I like the idea that yeah, you want to choose best of breed stuff like pick the right software for your business.\n\nI'm not going to come out guns and blades and say they're all bad, but having worked for SAP uh as as a case in point for the better part of a decade, I appreciate the stack obligation objective on the part of the vendor, but that's that's not best outcome for the customer.\n\nOkay. So, uh talk me through then. How do you pick your tech stack?\n\nI think you have to start with out objectives, outcome, and and the solution. What are you trying to deliver for your customer? And that's going to vary wildly. If you're Campbell Soup versus say Boomi, um, you know, those are two wildly different organizations. We may both need an ERP system, but the the needs are radically different. So I think thinking about your end customer first and the outcome followed by what is the simplest solution that you can pursue. I'm a big believer in the the kind of least common denominator the smallest unit required to deliver the solution gives you maximum flexibility. For me, it's just 30 years of seeing the tech debt, the tech obligation, the stack debt that piles up on organizations over time that I think is just it's both backbreaking and soul crushing at the same time.\n\nAbsolutely. Uh yeah, I think there's no one idea of a fun time having to deal with lots of different pieces of technology, half of which are out of date. I agree that a simple tech stack sounds amazing, but how do you get to that? I mean certainly like even a data company we're a relatively small company and we've got lots of different pieces of technology in place. How do you manage all that?\n\nThe way I think about the world and I have a lot of conversations with people. I I still to this day I love the movie The Matrix. I know it came out in 1999, but still because, you know, at the end of the movie when Neo, the protagonist, sees the world for what it is, the ones and zeros everywhere governing things, um, he's able to manipulate it. And I think that that's requisite for any leader, not just technology leaders today, and seeing the world as it is today. Look, there's like five major things that go into any tech stack, right? And people are I'm immediately going to regret this because I'm going to get like a thousand notes on LinkedIn, but you know, you have your your infrastructure layer, your security layer. Um, if we go through the seven layer OSI model for those that are nerds in the audience, which we won't, but you've got like apps, data, APIs, code, those are the big elements that go into a into a tech stack. And obviously there are are more than that, but really any business, take that Campbell soup example, right? Their job is to ultimately produce the the the best soup as a case in point that I'm going to love as a consumer and do it at a at a high profit but also high quality margin. And that's challenging. So you're going to need, you know, both front office, back office technology, you're going to need manufacturing technology. You're going to need all of those things. But the hard part is not can I pick SAP to run my manufacturing. That sounds like the hard part. It's not. The hard part is how do I connect all of the systems that I choose to be that Campbell soup is a case in point. And orchestrate all of those systems with seamless business processes, ensuring the data is of high quality so we can make good decisions about running our business. That's hard. I mean, think about it. It's 2025. Have you walked into a company yet where they they'll just say to you, \"Hey, you know what? We have all the data we need and it's perfect and we run a frictionless business process.\" I mean, we've invented AI for crying out loud in the world that we live in. We should have clean data, fluid business processes, and yet we don't.\n\nI'm right there with you. It does seem like anytime you want to achieve something, you need to interact with like multiple different pieces of technology. Quite often they don't talk to each other. Is there a solution to that? Like how do you work with multiple bits?\n\nYeah, there is. I mean, well, that's partly what you know, and this is not meant to be kind of self arrandizing. That's partly why my company Boomi exists. We exist because this stuff is hard. It's hard to connect to all of the data in your company for one person. Now multiply that times, you know, if you've got a,000, 10,000, 100 thousand or half a million people that work inside your organization, it's hard to just connect to the data. Then how do you ensure that the data is accurate, timely? That's hard. How do you then weave that data into business processes that have impact for your company? and and how do you make sure that they're agile not brittle so as the world evolves that that your processes evolve you know we live in a an imperfect world yet the business processes that are built in the SAP Oracle Microsoft systems they're very brittle right I I have seen many uh a business and a process crater just because someone changed a field in a database and that can bring the whole system down it doesn't flex, right? It just breaks. And and we need that bend not break mentality. Now, the exciting part, not to say AI too quickly because we say it, I think, too much, but the reality is is that AI and particularly agents in particular will give or gift business processes more of that flex where they can bend and not break and they can adapt. For whatever 20 years, every SI or systems integrator out there has been talking about the agile business, right? I can show you how unaggile your business is. Let me go remove a data table um in terms of, you know, access to a process and everything is cratered, right? It's still very fragile. And that's that's what gets me excited about this AI world is just the the flex that we can build into business processes.\n\nYeah, it's definitely uh a hot topic at the moment is I mean so many companies just trying to automate business processes and the idea that you can use AI agents to do this uh it is is just huge at the moment. But yeah, I can certainly see how there are a lot of very just brittle fragile processes like okay fine uh your customer intake form works great until the person doesn't have a surname or something and then everything is broken. Okay. So, can you talk me through it sounds like maybe like have uh trying to engineer more robust processes is a good idea. Talk me through how you might want to change your processes uh in this way.\n\nMy number one enemy in the world of business today is expense reports. I hate everything about them. They're soul crushing. They're boring. They're tedious. How is it in 2025 that I have to do a bunch of work to just submit an expense report? And I'm using this obviously as a broad analog. The person that submits it and it's like it goes off and you wait a week and then someone rejects it and you have to redo it. Like that that whole thing is just soul crushing. And if you're a company that I mean think about it. If you're a company that has 10,000 employees and on average, let's be really generous and say that the average employee only spends 5 hours a year. That may not seem like a lot doing expense reports, but that's 50,000 hours a year of wasted productivity. 50,000 hours for that one company. And if I walked in the door and said, \"Hey, would you like 50,000 hours of productivity back?\" Most companies would say yes. Now, multiply that times many orders of magnitude for, you know, something much more complex in manufacturing or, you know, process management, whatever it is. But this is exactly what AI can do. And that's what we've done here at Boomi is we've actually put in an AI agent that manages the entire expense report approval process. So there will be there's no humans that are involved in approving an expense report anymore at my company. A because I just hate them, but B because that's what AI does. And you say, well, how how does AI benefit the expense report approval process? I submit the name of one city as the reason why AI should handle expense reports, and that's Las Vegas. Las Vegas is the source for all expense report exceptions. It never fails, right? Every sales kickoff, there's some expense report you're looking at going, \"How what? How?\" Right? It's It doesn't matter. It could be the the threeperson $2,000 dinner and you're like, \"You got to be kidding me.\" Right? But there's always exceptions, right? In in this world and in a deterministic world that this is the if then else process world. If this happens, then do that. And by the way, every process on the planet today is largely deterministic. Um, you can't write enough if then else's to handle Las Vegas. It's impossible. It's not possible. But with AI, you can have AI which can reason. Now, Apple might argue against that with their latest report, but I believe that AI has the ability to reason. But at a minimum, AI has this new gener, you know, generated pre-trained transformers can improvise. is it can say well you know generally these things have happened and generally these expense reports have been approved and generally these exceptions are okay so I will generally approve it the process doesn't break down or the expense report get rejected and you recycle and you waste hours so what we're seeing Richie and this is long walker short point the entire world is going to pivot from deterministic processes to non-deterministic agentic process that's what's going to happen. I'd say probably seven out of 10 processes that have ever been built will be augmented, rewritten, enhanced with AI agents to be more non-deterministic or agentic. Now, and we can do that, by the way. That's something that we physically do is we can take literally every business process you have and we can modernize it to be more agentic.\n\nThat's very cool. And certainly I'm with you that expenses are boring. No one wants to do them. automating them seems a really good idea. It does raise some interesting questions though, like uh you mentioned the the idea of Las Vegas. Everything's weird there. You're going to get some funny reports. I presume you're gonna want a human to monitor those things. I mean, they probably don't necessarily want to read what happened in Vegas, but uh yeah, when do you want a human involved in these agentic processes?\n\nWell, I think Richie, you are getting to the heart of the matter here, which is I don't think the discussion should should center like societal level discussion on is AI going to do more for us? Yes. Like is that's going to happen. Is AI going to replace some jobs? Yes, it will. It will take time to do these things, but other jobs will emerge. Here's what's going to happen. As we humans seed more work that honestly we don't want to do anyway. Who wants to do the soul crushing tedious work of watching every little exception to every no one wants to do that. So we'll seed that work to AI but you need then humans in the loop. You need what we we call like well you need a watchtowwer. We actually have something that we've built called the control tower. It's literally the agent control tower. So, as you create agents to do things, manage and approve expense reports, watch a manufacturing process, ensure that a one of your most important customers never gets an angry, you know, letter strongly worded from a\n\n\nSystem\nthat it should never be printed. Whatever\nwe seed to AI, we have a control tower\nthat can literally watch thousands, tens\nof thousands, millions of agents at one\ntime and bring humans in the loop when\nit matters. Is an agent hallucinating?\nIs it deviating off a well-worn path\nthat you never intended? And so our\nagent control tower does exactly that.\nAnd that there's a whole industry that's\ngoing to get built around, is being built\nright now around, okay, humans seed more\nwork to AI, but we need to be brought\ninto the authorization loop. However, as\nyou know, this is a cycle. What will\nhappen is we'll get more comfortable\nwith the AI handling the expense\nreports. We're never involved, and we'll\nmove on to seeding even higher ground.\nHow high that goes, I do not know. If\nyou're Sam Altman, you say everything.\nBut it's his job to say everything\nbecause it sells more chat GPT. That's a\nvery cool setup. I like the idea of\nhaving a control tower agent to watch\nthe other agents. We'll maybe get into\nthe architecture in more depth in a\nmoment. But first, I also have a\nquestion related to this around\nresponsibility. So, our chief finance\nofficer, no way you can get\nanything past him, but it feels like an\nagent, maybe you could kind of game\nit a bit in order to get your expenses\nthrough. So, is there a level of\nresponsibility there? Like, do you want\nan agent taking responsibility for\nexpenses being passed, like if it's a\nsketchy expense, or do you want a\nhuman to take responsibility? Like,\nwhere does the book stop?\nWell, it's interesting because if you\nlook at the cycles of technology\ninnovation, humans and AI, but\nhumans have gone out and built things\nlike applications. Then we need to build\nsystems to govern those things. There\nare literally, there's a whole industry\naround governance solutions, right, for\ndata and decisions and expense\nmanagement. Here's what I'll say. There\nis no CFO that will keep their job if\nthey don't have an AI governance\nplatform that they, you won't, you can't\nsuccessfully adopt AI. Think about\nhealthcare. What hospital would adopt AI\nsainely adopt AI without a governance\nplatform? I mean, you and I could sit\nhere, Richie, and we could pontificate\nfor hours about all the amazing\nthings, which I truly believe AI will be\nable to do to help us live longer and\nprovide better care. And we, I was at a\nhospital last week on Monday, and they\nwere showing us this AI system that\ndetects a fall by any patient in any\nhospital immediately. It's a fantastic\ntechnology, but you have to be\nable to govern it as you have AI that\nthat at some point will produce a\nprescription recommendation.\nBut if you don't have the governance,\nthe oversight, CFOs won't have jobs.\nThis should be the number one\npriority for a CFO and a CEO, frankly, is\nbringing in an AI governance platform\nbefore they bring in AI.\nOkay, so this seems like an important\nordering of things. So suppose like\nyour CEO says, okay, we're going to be all\nin on AI, we need to run an AI\ntransformation program. What's the kind\nof steps? You said you do AI\ngovernance before you start building\nstuff, but like, yeah, talk me through what\nare all the different steps in order\nthen?\nHere at Boomi, we actually did it the\nwrong way originally. So for my big giant\nsoftware company, we started with AI. We\nbuilt the expense, mainly because Steve's\nranting in the background here going, I\nhate expens. We've built customer\nsuccess management agent. We have agents\nthat literally, I'm not\nexaggerating, that produce marketing\nmaterials that like a perfectly\nformatted marketing slick that is\nbespoke to a customer. We no longer\neither, you know, through PDF, not not\nthat we would actually print it anymore.\nWe don't hand out generic marketing\nmaterial. You get your company's\nmarketing materials exactly from Boomi\nwith no human involved. That that's the\nkind of stuff that we're building. So we\nbuilt all that very, very cool, but then\nwe quickly realized as we were building\nour own agent governance platform, wow,\nwe're really going to need this, like\nthis is a highly necessary thing. So for\nme, obviously, the first thing that you\nwant to start with is how are we going\nto prepare our data and our applications\nto feed AI. The number one rule that has\nexisted in software, specifically data\nanalytics, you name it, is garbage in\ngarbage out. So, it really doesn't\nmatter what AI does for you. If you\ncan't feed it positive data and and feed\nit high volumes of quality data, it\nwon't learn to that 99.999%\naccuracy level that you want within your\nbusiness. That's number one.\nData's got to be ready. That rule\ndoesn't go away just because we now have\nmagic AI. Then number two is how will\nyou govern it? That has to be rule or\nstep number two. If it's not, you are\n100% speaking from experience doing it\nwrong. And this is in every industry\nwithout exception. But think about\nhighly regulated industries, healthcare,\nbanking, dot dot dot. With AI, you would\nyou, Richie, accept it if I said, \"Hey, I'm\na retailer and I'm going to have a\ncustomer support AI that generally is\naccurate 90% of the time in recommending\na product.\" Sure. Right. That that's\ngreat. I might even get a promotion for\n90% of the time. But you go to healthare\nand you put in an AI that's right 90% of\nthe time, not acceptable\nat all. Right? So that demarcation\npoint is incredibly critical and varies\nwildly by industry. So we have to be\nvery cognizant of that. But so that's\nwhy governance kind of first right\nbehind data, and then once you get\ngovernance, then it really is an outcome\noriented conversation is where do we\nthink the lowhanging fruit? And I I\nbelieve that AI has both a topdown\nopportunity, and let's use, let's use\nsomething like pharmaceutical as a case\nin point, right? Everybody immediately\ngoes to something like protein folding,\nright, which is like way above my head.\nLet's go get AI to simulate protein fold\nso we\naccelerate, you know, new drug\ndiscovery. Awesome. That's not what we\ndo. What we do is bottom up AI. That\nthat is look at every single business\nprocess in your organization. So in that\npharmaceutical organization, the expense\nreports is the very lame example, but\nnonetheless it works as an analog, but\nevery single business process. So\nbilling, collections, you name it. That\nhospital that I was at last week, they\nsaid to me, and I quote, \"Steve, one of\nour biggest challenges in our back\noffice, the run the business of the\nhospital, their number one challenge is\nthat all of these claims handlers or\nthe pro the the the payers. They\nhave these sophisticated AIs that have\nbecome really, really good at rejecting\nclaims. They have over a million\nrejected claims a year through AI alone.\nHow does a hospital compete with these\nridiculously well-funded insurance\ncompanies when it comes to I I did\nlegitimate work, I'm submitting a\nlegitimate claim, and AI over at the\npayer finds some clever way to not pay\nfor it. You got to fight fire with fire.\nSo that's when you you must be in the AI\nworld. You have to have an AI that can\nreceive that just magically rejected\nclaim, understand why, rework the claim,\nand then resubmit. Humans cannot compete\nin this world. Not anymore. And so\nthat's a those are high requirements.\nBut just to get back to your point, I\nthink it starts with data, then it gets\ninto governance. And then my strong\nrecommendation is look for the the\nthousand flowers that can bloom across\nyour business processes that create\nmillions of hours of discovered\nproductivity.\nOkay. So that makes a lot of sense.\nIt's kind of scary. The idea is going to\nbe like your company's bots versus\nanother company's bots though, kind of\nfighting it out. But yeah, maybe that's\nthe world we're heading towards.\nThat is the world, right? It's I mean\nit's, you know, things that you and I,\nlike I, I would never, I've never even\ndabbled in things like day trading with\nstocks, right? Because that world is\nlargely dominated by AI now. And as that\nworld is dominated by, so you just think\nit's just too sophisticated, too.\nBut darn near every business process,\nagain, I think it's kind of a seven out\nof 10, will just go this way. And so, if\nyou're that business that believes that\nyou can operate successfully without\nagentic or non-deterministic agentic\nprocesses, you are you are wrong. You\nwill be the blockbuster video of the\nmodern era. That's a pretty sort of\nsharp warning there. Um, so it sounds\nlike because you mentioned that the\nrequirements are very different from\nindustry to industry or from use case to\nuse case. So is there a step before this\nthen where you've got to try and figure\nout, well, what are the suitable use cases\nfor my business? Yeah. Well, that's the\nwhole outcome, right? The outcomes are the\nuse cases, the scenarios, and you know, I'm\nsure folks tuning in as well are going\nto go, well, Steve, what about the model?\nAbsolutely, you want to select the right\nmodel. I'm presuming that people will do\ntheir homework and choose the right\nmodel that's been grounded or you know\neither fine-tuned or you know\npotentially grounded in your industry\ncontext, or you should do that work. Now\nmy company does that work as well. So we\ncan connect to the data, build the\nbusiness processes, add AI to it, and also\nhelp you with grounding models for those\nuse cases. That's stuff that it's\nfascinating because two years ago, if you\nand I were chatting, just two, not not\neven two years ago, a year ago, one year\nago, when you and I were talking about AI\nagents in the enterprise, probably most\npeople listening would have kind of, you\nknow, hiked up their pants a little bit\nand said, I don't know about that, it,\nwhen is that coming? And here we are\ntalking about AI agents, right? And it's\ntotally normal, like this is a very normal\nconversation is where are we going to\ndeploy AI, but it would have a year ago,\nit felt like wizardry or witchcraft,\ncraft, how, wow, where, where do I, how do I\nbuild an agent? We've literally created\nan agent building platform, not just the\nagent governance, but we've given our our\ncustomers, 23,000 of them, the ability to\ncreate AI agents with just words, not\ncode. I can just describe the agent I\nwant, and our system builds it for you,\nand then you can drop it into a process.\nSo now that we've gone from like it's\nwitchcraft to this is like not even\nslight of hand, just very straightforward.\nNow, I think we're going to get to the\npoint where the vast majority of jobs,\ncertainly in my business, we're actually\ndoing this right now, where accountants,\nthey won't do accounting, they will\nbuild agents that do accounting for\nthem. And so, or attorneys that will\nbuild agents that do legal work for\nthem. In fact, in my company, we're\ntaking a person or more, one or more\npeople from every single department in\nmy company, every single one, and we're\ngoing to be retraining them on how to\nbuild AI agents with our own platform to\nto do what they do. And then they will\nbe the supervisor, the orchestrator\nthere. I don't think it's that we, we\ndon't have any intent to replace people.\nI just believe that AI can make a person\nlike me superhuman, right? I can do five\ntimes the work I used to be able or\nwhatever it ends up being. So, I, I, uh,\nI'm not going to be the guy that sits\naround and pulls the Sam Altman and\nprognosticates the AI is going to take\neverybody's jobs, but I do think for the\nnext 5 years, we'll see this\nproductivity renaissance\nthat really is going to make us super\nhuman. Beyond that, will there be some\njobs? Yes, that you know, change or go\naway or replace, but I'm I'm not a\nbeliever that AI just becomes this magic\nsuper intelligence in the next 24\nmonths.\nOkay. So, yeah, very much grounded in\nsort of practical improvements. So it\nit does sound like you've got a fairly\nsophisticated agent program going on at\nBoomi. Uh, I'm curious as to like what\norder you you decided to build things\nout, like, uh, you mentioned like, uh, a\nlot of the operations jobs, they've now got\nagents, like what are the first agent use\ncases you started with?\nWell, that was what I called out earlier,\nso it was like expense reports, customer\nsuccess and support being two examples.\nEvery company on the planet has done the\nsame thing, I believe, which is this is\ninteresting. Let's try something, right?\nAnd we've gone through and tried and\nlearned, but then immediately you bounce\nback to all right, how do I scale this\nacross my whole company? It's kind of\nlike useful in a narrow sense, but\nexactly what you asked. How do I\nsupervise it? How do I bring a human in\nthe loop? How do I govern it? And so\nthat's what we bounced back to. And\nthat's like two years ago, we started\nbuilding this agent control tower. Um,\nbut I think the use cases, my\nrecommendation for everybody with an\nearshot of this discussion is pick the\nlowhanging fruit. Identify the\nsoulcrushing uninteresting work, the\ntedium that no one wants to be involved\nwith anyway, and let's move that out of\nyour business. You people will write\nsongs about you if you can do that. That\nand and it was interesting because you\nknow, Richie, we had this um when we\nlaunched the customer success management\nagent, now we have physical humans that\nwe call customer success managers, and we\nwhen we first said, hey, we're going to\nbuild a CSM agent, there was, and I mean\nuniversal weeping, wailing, nashing of\nteeth, there was a freakout across the\nboard because universally, I, I don't want\nto, no, I don't want to engage with that\nthing. And when we said, whoa, whoa, whoa,\nhold on a second, this is to augment\nthe work that you do. So, think about\nit. I said to a group of CSN, how much\ntime do you spend trying to figure out\nwhich customer has access to which\nproducts and which licenses they bought\nfor those products? How much time? Oh\ngod, Steve. Like, you know, ungodly\namounts of hours per month. Okay. Well,\nwe just took that to zero. Oh, okay. I\nunderstand the outcome here. So, and and\nthe message was this with this agent\nwill make you superhuman. It'll make you\nthe best version of you. You will be\nthat 10x person that you've always\ndreamed of being. And when we did that,\nplus we brought them into the process of\ncreating, defining, etc., the adoption\nwent through the roof. But the other\nthing I found out was, and and just\nreinforced is if you want to lose\nengagement with humans really quickly\nbeyond the like you know, involve them, is\nmake it wrong, give it bad data, and that\nthat's just you know, that's like think\nabout it, right? When when back in the\n2000s when business intelligence was the\nthing and we said dashboards a lot, um,\nthe easiest way to reduce dashboard or\nreport adoption to zero is make the data\nwrong, right? And that's exactly where\nwe are with AI is just make its input\nhighly variable, inaccurate, and so you\ngot to spend time diving\n\n\nIt in. But I think the use cases are nearly infinite.\n\nAnd, and in a minute, I'm, I'll, I'll pause here and take a breath. But I'll tell you about this automotive agent that, for this automotive manufacturer that we're working on.\n\nYou want to hear about it?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'd love to hear about the automotive agent.\n\nTariffs seem to be a thing right now. I don't know if you've heard anything, right? Just a little bit.\n\nSo, you know, a Z automotive company sat down with us and said, \"Well, you know, we have thousands and thousands of processes, back office processes, manufacturing processes in the plant, but we have no sense in real time for when a part, a particular part is at risk for tariff impact.\" And, and that could be anything from perhaps not tier one suppliers, but tier two and tier three suppliers. So if we see a tariff go up 60%, are we going to see not just a disruption in terms of cost, but a disruption in terms of supply, right? So cost you can kind of manage through because that's a COGS thing, but what about supply? Are we going to see the supplier just completely shut down? So how can we create agents at every single supply point in our process so that we can start to get real time alerts? So this agent could be aware of any tariff that is specific to its part that it looks after from its particular supplier in its particular country, and it shoots a flare up to the business leaders if there's a problem coming. Now the challenge, right? You said, \"Well, well, can I just write code to do that?\" Yeah, but what if the tariffs are changing every week, and how do you know which website do you go to for what tariff information, and what if it's changing daily, right? This is a highly fluid situation. That's a perfect use case for AI risk identification, highly fluid environment, and that's exactly what we're building right now. So those are the kinds of things that you can do with AI at an industry level, you know, way, way beyond expense report approvals.\n\nI see. That's pretty cool. Uh, it does seem incredibly challenging then because you've got uh, changing policy, uh, stuff changing, well, I mean, it was on a almost daily basis at one point, but yeah, and you got to change your strategy based upon that. It requires some high level thinking, tons of different data from different sources. So this is uh, yeah, an incredibly challenging thing to solve.\n\nIt sounds like um, there's a huge scope then in terms of the agents you can build. So you can go from something that's very narrow, mostly deterministic, uh, and it's basically like a software workflow with a little bit of AI in there, right through to something that is, uh, incredibly complex and almost sort of employee level capabilities. Is, do you have a sense of like where the sweet spot is for where you should be targeting most of your efforts?\n\nWell, I'm going to do a shameless plug for a book here is that's why I wrote this. I mean, so, so Digital Impact, right? It's called the The Human Element of AI-Driven Transformation. If you want to go get a copy. But that's exactly what I talk about in the book is the scope, the where to start. So I interview, for example, there's industry leaders that I talk to in the book. Mark Fields, who's the former CEO of Ford. I spent a ton of time interviewing Mark. Paul Cormier, the former CEO and chairman of Red Hat. Spent time with him. Vishal Sika, the former CEO of Infosys, and just talking to these industry leaders about where they see AI and how it's going to impact those specific industries. And then I, uh, I have, there's about a dozen um, success stories with AI that I cover in the book. Anything that ranges from uh, companies like uh, Tony's Chocolonely is a case in point to um, the Australian Red Cross is a great case in point. If you remember a couple years back, the, the, the wildfires that blew through Australia, they just ravaged a massive portion of the country. The Australian Red Cross prior to those wildfires, they were handling, I, I think like 30 cases a day, right? Well, when there's no emergency, there's not that, you know, as much to do. They had to scale up to 300,000 cases in 24 hours, and how they tackled that. Uh, what an incredible story. The American Cancer Society, I tell a story about how they're using data, insight, and uh, and, and automation to just literally arrange rides for elderly patients to go get their care. As it turns out, when you think about getting chemotherapy for somebody that's over the age of 80, their biggest challenge is actually not insurance. Their biggest challenge is how do I get the care? How do I physically get a ride to get there? And uh, and so what a brilliant, you know, and by the way, life-saving, life-impacting story. So that the book covers literally dozens and dozens of both real world scenarios as well as, you know, I'm talking to industry leaders that predict where this is all going. I do love the the stories where it's like, \"Oh, wow. We've had a like a real-world impact. This is, you know, benefiting society, like helping old people get to their get to the hospital, uh, helping deal with wildfire. This is why we do this, right? It's not just like, oh, we're, we're trying to make, I mean, making more money is very nice, but uh, having a good impact on the world is also wonderful.\"\n\nRichie, you said it perfectly because like the thing that we all have to think about, I've been in software a long time, 30 plus years now. And for 30 years, the message has been largely the same, which is, \"Hey, if you just use this thing, all of your problems will go away. Your productivity will go through the roof. It'll be amazing.\" Well, here we are with AI now. But the real question is, does, do any of us when we go to work, do we really feel more productive or do we feel burdened by technology? The, \"Oh my god, I got to log in and go, you know, click on 17 things that I didn't want to anyway.\" I, I feel more burdened by technology today than I do enhanced, and I hope, and I believe that AI this time around, and that's partly what's in the book as well, is let's get it right, let's build software for humans, let's make the, let's take away the soul-crushing work and give back more time to humans so that we can do the things that we are extraordinarily good at, that we can imagine, that we can see past what the corpus of knowledge allows for, and to maybe put the viewer or listener's mind at ease here, the thing right now that AI is good at is working within the corpus of knowledge, right? It's extraordinarily good at that, but what it is not yet good at, now I'm not going to say ever, is, is looking beyond that corpus of knowledge, and that's where I think humanity needs to go, is beyond the, not to get like Star Treky, but to the next frontier, and let's imagine, and that's where I hope we are, but boy, we've got to get it right this time, and it comes back to those fundamentals we talked about.\n\nYeah, definitely, I agree. We use so much technology on a day-to-day basis, some of it's joyful, but there's so much bad software that is just an absolute grind to use. I know we got a few builders in the audience. Please do uh, build us some nice software. But um, you mentioned that uh, you things should be built for humans, and like the subtitle of your book is about the human element of AI-driven transformation. So let's talk about the humans then. So uh, suppose you do want to make use of all this AI stuff, like what, what do you human, what do the humans have to do? So who's involved in this? Who runs these AI transformation programs? Well, I, you know, I will say, and I'll, I will answer that question directly. I think it's worth me saying as well. We humans have to take control of this situation, and what I mean is AI. It's wonderful that Sam and his band of merry women and men as well as Anthropic and, you know, a couple other companies are marching towards AGI. Well, that doesn't mean that we have to live in a world defined by Sam Altman. In fact, I refuse to live in a world defined by a dude named Sam. And I think all of us have got to put our foots down and say, \"No, it's not going to work that way.\" So that's why we built this agent control tower to start, and we're thinking at a much more grand scale around AI orchestration. We humans, this is our world. We should not seed it to an intelligence larger than us, and we end up what, you know, weaving baskets and that's pretty much it. I think there has to be a better vision for the world than Sam Altman makes a lot of money and then we all lose our jobs. And so first and foremost, we all have to put our foot down with our legislators as well as within our companies that we are going to control this. We're not going to seed control to some self-driving enterprise entity. So sorry for the rant, but that's number one. Then number two is we all have to sit down and decide within our organizations what we want AI to do. What is that waterline, and what are we prepared to seed and why, and how will we measure the ROI, and what are we not prepared to seed to AI and why? There's just not enough of those conversations going on right now. So let's have those conversations. So if you're a CEO and you're listening and you're not driving those conversations, that you haven't even, you don't even have a piece of paper or you've written down to write, \"These are the things that are probably good for AI to do, and these are the things that are not good for AI to do in my business,\" then shame on you, get your act together and pull that stuff, you know, onto a piece of paper. So I, I just think that right now there are some very important conversations both at a societal, you know, kind of macro level that we must have, and all of us have to participate in, because I, for one, will not sit idly by and watch Sam decide what the world's going to look like. But at the same time, we have to do that. It's kind of like think globally, act locally. We have to do that within our company level as well, which comes back to if your company doesn't have the governance platform, you're already making, you're already down the wrong path.\n\nI love that. Uh, yeah, you got to have some limits on what do you, what do you not want to do with AI? I'm curious, do you have limits like that at Boomi? Are there any things you said, \"Okay, we're not going to use AI for this at Boomi?\"\n\nYeah. Um, there's a lot of things that we do and do not have, you know, intent to do at Boomi. So first of all, when we think about the easy stuff is like, are we going to have AI run our HR team? No. No. As far as I'm concerned. Now, are there productivity enhancing elements? Sure. But, but people manage and lead with people. That's the way this works. Um, and until I see an AI that demonstrates true empathy and understanding. No. And the, the easy way to think about it is go ask an employee, anyone, just, just go, go to work and or one of your colleagues and say, \"Would you be comfortable with AI conducting your annual compensation review?\" Would you?\n\nThat's pretty brutal. Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.\n\nNow, I'm sure there's somebody that's going to find the exception and go, \"Hey, Steve, I think AI could be more impartial than a human.\" Maybe, maybe. But I'm still not going to have AI do my comp review. That is not happening. So there's that, right? So I think the, so for me, people leading people is an area where I do not believe AI should go right now. I think, you know, we talk about AI writing code. I absolutely think that AI should build code. But the real question is where does the innovation come from? AI again working within the corpus of knowledge that it has, right? It, it, it has data and synthetic data to go model its, its recommendations on. But I can tell you even the most sophisticated AI models that we've laid our hands on, they are not coming up with the innovative beyond the frontier ideas that my engineers do today, and they will continue to do that for a long, long time, again, no matter what Sam says. Um, so there is that. So that's the second thing. So I think people, leadership, obviously the, the innovation concepts, all of that, and, and there's a long list of things that we've drawn that, that we believe AI should, should currently not do. So, you know, we'll see where this game goes. But I do think that, you know, for the next 3 to 5 years, I think what I'm arguing will largely be realistic and kind of manageable within the world of software. And I, I, I realize again, if you're like the AI, you know, dude or dudead or whatever, that you're going to argue against this, but businesses right now need to focus on the most practical rate of return AI scenarios out there. If we don't, and we try a bunch of science projects and it fails, it sets it back years. That's all.\n\nOkay. Yeah, that seems very practical advice, and certainly, um, it may be fun to do these sort of science projects, and you, if you're a research organization, probably go for it, but in general, yeah, I would uh, stick to uh, what's sort of going to give you a high chance of getting you a good return on investment.\n\nCool. So uh, one thing um, that's kind of the tricky part is you got to change all your processes to incorporate AI in some way. How does that act of process re-engineering work? How do you go about it? Well, most organizations today have some fairly sophisticated software process, their, you know, process discovery technology. They've got a lot of their processes mapped. Now, if you don't, then you probably should go through a process discovery, process mapping proc uh, you know, kind of process. Once you've done that, then conveniently, and here's where AI can come in. We have technology that can optimize those processes for you. We out of our 23,000 plus customers that we have, Boomi as a company, we have almost half a billion with a B unique business processes that we have mapped and modeled over time. So we have a intergalactically large database that we've put the processes into a vectorzed model, and now we can interrogate and understand, and AI can talk to it. That's awesome. But that process optimization, what you're looking for, I'll give you a perfect example. So, if you have a process that has a, is a deterministic, we'll go back to what we talked about at the beginning, a deterministic process that has 2,000 steps in it. Our model can look at that and say,\nI could probably skinny that down from 2,000 steps to 20. And the reason, and how we could do that is if you create\n\n\nAgents for these five or six things that kind of bulk of the process. Now you have maybe 15 deterministic steps and five agents, right? So that kind of process transformation is the kind of discussion and exploration that we can have with any customer because again, what doesn't change is you're doing integration, you're doing automation of your business. You're just doing it with more intelligent elements in the process. So that's kind of how I think about it.\n\nBut I think process discovery, and then there's process remapping. There's one company we're working with right now where they have an antiquated billing system, and it's probably 25 years old, is my, you know, implemented in 2000, and they're looking to modernize that billing process without ripping out the guts of it. So it's how do we bring agents that can be invoked at certain pieces and parts of the process? So there's, we've integrated Boomi, and there's trigger points in the process that we shoot a flare up, an agent does some work, and then we inject the output from that agent back into the billing process. Seems fairly straightforward, but when you're dealing with code that was written 25 years ago, that's the hard part. That's what Boomi excels at is we can work in a hybrid environment where you've got an on-premise old school billing system. You've got a modern cloud interface for your customers, but you want to have, uh, you want to agentify, to use that buzzword, the process and make it significantly more modern. That's what we do.\n\nThere was one part that kind of scared me though. Did you say you have half a billion processes? Like the idea of writing down like one process that seems a lot of effort to me. Getting all your processes documented at scale. How does that work?\n\nWell, ironically, we wrote an agent for that. So, and now to be clear, we've been storing metadata about. So, with 23,000 customers, it's really not that hard to get to half a billion processes. We've been storing metadata about those processes. We don't actually store the customer, you know, the data within the process. That's not something that our customers would allow us to do, and rightfully so. But the metadata about the processes, those go into, have gone in for over a decade from our company into a database that we've had and managed and curated, and it's helped us deliver better solutions, which is a good idea. And then along comes, you know, generate pre-trained transformers, large language models, and we then started to move that data into more of a vectorized database. And then that gives you the ability to then start to have the AI refer to it as well as fine-tune the AI that we use. And then we said, \"All right, now the next thing we're going to do is we're actually going to build an agent that documents all of these processes.\" So we literally have an agent where you can say, \"Hey, I just built a business process. Document the whole thing, everything about it for me.\" And over time, we've refined this agent. It's one of our most popular ones.\n\nSo here's a case in point. So when we launched it, we actually launched a number of AI agents about a year, almost a year and a half ago, not quite, but almost. And those AI agents, they help our customers do things like document processes, even build processes. You can literally say to one of our agents, \"Hey, I need you to build an employee onboarding process for me.\" And it just does it because it knows the systems that you have and the data and blah, blah, blah. So we have that. We have another process that monitors all of your data for PII, personal or private information infraction. So if you're moving data from France to the US when you shouldn't, it kind of, you know, lights up a little dashboard and says not good. And, uh, and so all of those existed, uh, or we launched a year and a half ago. We have about 40,000 of those AI agents that are in daily active use in our customer base now. So our customers are actively using these agents to document processes, build processes, monitor data, and that has exceeded my expectations. So these are not cutesy little, you know, co-pilots that go, \"Hey, you might want to, you got a spelling error.\" These are real hardcore heavy lift agents, and we have a massive deployed base of those agents now. It's, um, it adds up very quickly to this flywheel where you're starting to get more insight, and the agents get better, and they're, there's reinforcement learning with the agents. It's, um, it's quite the flywheel.\n\nAbsolutely. That does sound fantastic. But 40, so 40,000 agents, this is in production just with your customers. Can you jump with me, like, what do you think the ratio of like work being done by humans to work being done by agents is at the moment?\n\nWell, I mean, just even a year ago, I would have said that it was more pre, pre the launch of these agents, let alone our agent builder platform. I would have said 100% of the work in Boomi is being done by humans a year ago, and I'd say today, uh, it's probably 80% of the work being done by humans, but 20% by AI. Now, interestingly, there's work that was never done by humans. Let's take documentation. Look, we have the ability for people to document processes, but again, that's soul-crushing work. Who writes stuff down? I'm kind of joking a little bit, but not really, right? It's like, and if you do document a process, it's like seven words. It's like, yes, it monitors, you know, uh, you know, beer production done. It's just, you know, the documentation was never thorough and detailed. The documentation that is done by our agents today. First of all, it's done. Second of all, it's comprehensive. And third, it's compliant, right? You know, our organizations and our customers have, they work in high compliant require compliance requirement industries. And so even just giving them that capability is amazing. But I'd say probably in a year, we've gone from zero to 20% of the work done by AI.\n\nThat's very impressive. And I agree on documentation. I hate writing things down. It's like, I don't think many humans do enjoy it. Uh, so yeah, certainly a great candidate for outsourcing stuff. Uh, what's the end game for this then? Like how much of your business do you think you can have running, uh, using agents?\n\n80% of the work should be done by AI, 80%. Now that takes time. The, the thing, the one thing I will caveat that with is, you know, we, we want to make, you know, anyone that uses Boomi ridiculously productive in terms of integrating and automating their company. That's what we want to do. But we also want to gift them the ability to create their own agents to do whatever they want, right? And that's what we launched probably like three weeks ago is our agent studio that create agents without code and then govern them with the platform. But I kind of think of the analogy like, um, you know, self-driving cars. And I, you know, I know how people can kind of get, you know, uh, a little fussy about how they feel about Tesla. So, let's not use Tesla as the analog. But when you observe self-driving cars, it's not like we got into a Tesla three years ago when it just drove all around the city, right? It, it kind of originally, we, if you remember, it had like adaptive cruise control. You could get on the highway and it kind of slow down, speed up, and then it kept you in the lane automatically. And, you know, eventually now there's self-driving cars that will take the dramatic turn left across oncoming traffic or right if you're in the UK, but we do that. And so we've had these incremental steps where AI, the AI in the cars, it's gotten smarter. You can go to San Francisco now and get your Whimo app and click a button, and there's nobody in the car, and it comes and picks you up and drives you wherever. And so we're, we're, I think with Boomi, we have that similar vision, right? Which is you will always use the service like, like Whimo for transportation. You'll use Boomi to do integration and automation, but we would love for the, you know, the Boomi cars, so to speak, to come pick you up and take you on an amazing drive and make it awesome.\n\nNice. So, it does seem like, uh, you can really push this, uh, very long way, and but the trick is do it in stages rather than like, don't try and jump to your own business for the self-driving car straight away.\n\nWell, that's the thing. So, I think maybe if I rewrote the book, I'd probably title it self-driving enterprise because we will get there, but it will be many moons.\n\nNice. Uh, something to look forward to. Um, all right. So, uh, I'm curious. Do you have any final advice on just how you can go about like building agents into your enterprise workflows then?\n\nWell, beyond the get your data right, drive the governance, um, which we've talked about many times is you got to, you just got to start now, right? It's like, I mean, if you're not, the safest thing I could possibly say in this conversation, Richie, is if you are not proactively building agents, transforming your processes into agentic processes, you will be the next Blockbuster video. You will be that. And, and whereas we all have that Blockbuster cautionary tale, you know, Netflix got the internet right, blah, blah, blah, there will be a million Blockbuster videos. There will just be a million companies that just cannot compete with largely AI-driven or agentic processes that the company that can go from, you know, hey, I'm automated, yay for me, which there's still a lot of companies that are not doing well with automation, but the companies that can go from I'm, you know, I'm semi or automated to 50% of my processes are driven through a gentic, you know, process, they will win. But you've got to do it quickly. And if you don't do it now, I can promise you you will be Blockbuster Video.\n\nUh, yeah, there's a big gap there between my business has gone completely folded and I'm making a large amount of money. Yeah, everyone wants to be Netflix rather than Blockbuster. So just finally, I always want recommendations for people to follow. Uh, so whose work are you most excited about at the moment? Who should I be looking into?\n\nWell, shoot. You know, I'm going to contradict myself and say like, like if you're, if you are not daily staying in tune with, you know, across primarily three entities, right? Anthropic and, you know, claw and the engine that they have, OpenAI with chat GPT as well as operator and many of the other things that they have. But Google with Gemini, I think Google kind of went from last technologically two years ago to really a leader in this space in many fronts. Like you got to stay on top of what they're doing. So, I would really kind of like you've got to be dialed into news feeds. But then I will say you got to stay dialed in there, but take what they say with a grain of salt. There's a, you know, their job is to kind of overhype this because it gets headlines. But it is one of those things that I, I have spent more time in the past two years relearning everything I know about software than I did in the previous 25.\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, there's so much exciting stuff coming out all the time. So yeah, certainly following OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, their just journey out, like lots of interesting things.\n\nCool. All right. Wonderful. Uh, thank you so much for your time, Steve. That was fantastic.\n\nIt was a pleasure. It was great to talk to you.\n[Music]\n",
