  "cleanText": "What's up everybody?\nAdele here.\nIn today's video, we're going to walk you through how to build AI agents with the Google ADK package.\nOur instructor VB will walk you through the fundamentals of building AI agents with Google ADK, how to set it up on your own environment, and building more complex agents that require tools, functions, and more.\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to check out our course on building AI agents with Google ADK.\nAnd with that said, happy learning.\nHey guys, what's up?\nIn this tutorial, we're going to be learning all about Google ADK, the brand new agentic development kit by Google.\nNow, this is the best time to get started because, well, it's brand new, and this will really get us ahead of the curve.\nIf you are ready to go on this journey with me and learn about Google ADK, I will see you in the tutorial.\nAll right, guys.\nSo, we have a bunch of stuff to cover in this 1 hour to 1 and 1/2 hour tutorial.\nSo, let's get started with just the introduction.\nI want to start off by asking you what even is Google ADK?\nWell, to simply put, Google ADK is an open-source code-first Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents with flexibility and control.\nUnlike other agentic frameworks like Langraph, Crew AI, Langchain, and so on, ADK gives you fine-grain control when building advanced AI agents that are tightly integrated with services in Google Cloud.\nSo in simple words, it allows us to define agent behavior, orchestration, and tools used directly in code, enabling robust debugging, versioning, and deployment anywhere.\nSo what makes it different to well other agentic frameworks?\nWell, Google ADK stands out here in several key ways.\nNumber one, Google Cloud is native.\nUnlike Langchain, Crew AI, Autogen, the list goes on.\nADK is specifically designed for tight integration with Google cloud services specifically Vertex AI, Cloud Run, etc.\nNumber two, code-first approach.\nWhile Langra focuses on graph-based workflow and Crew AI emphasizes role-based agent, ADK prioritizes this direct Python code and agentic behavior and orchestration.\nNumber three, deployment ready.\nADK includes built-in deployment capabilities to Google Cloud like I said before, and this is quite beneficial because others require additional infrastructure setup.\nAnd number four, it's simpler architecture.\nCompared to Langchain's complex chains and Origin's multi-agent conversations, ADK offers a cleaner, more straightforward approach to building agents.\nNow, if you noticed, I've said agents quite a lot of times, but what exactly even is an agent?\nWell, this is a beautiful diagram by Google themselves in the documentation.\nUh as you can see I took the image take uh from Google, but it's quite a good image because it clearly shows what type of agents Google ADK provides.\nSo if we look closely we can see there are three main types of agents: LLM-based, workflow agent, and custom logic.\nAll of these agents inherit from this one base agent class.\nAnd you can see in the diagram there are arrows pointing from the base agent saying extended by.\nNow what do agents have in common?\nSome agents have looping functionalities, some could have reasoning abilities, some can execute tasks alongside other agents, and some have access to tools.\nBut the most important thing here to note is that these agents extend the base agent class like I just mentioned.\nLike I said, there are three subcategories.\nNow, I want to go a bit in depth about each of these slightly, but it will make more sense once we get into the code.\nNumber one, LLM-based agents.\nYou can write these as LLM agent or agent in the code, and these essentially use LLMs as the base model for natural language understanding and reasoning.\nNumber two, the workflow agent as defined here.\nWorkflow agents include things like sequential agent, parallel agent, loop agents, the list goes on, but these really are controlled execution flow of other agents in predefined patterns.\nAnd number three, custom agents.\nNow, what if these two agent types don't really help us?\nAnd number three, custom agents.\nNow, what if these two type of agents don't really satisfy our needs?\nAnd that's where custom agents aka this section with custom logic comes in.\nWe can build by extending base agent for unique, more tailored implementations specific to us.\nNow, if you want more documentation and details about these, you can go into these links I provided in the documentation.\nAll of this code, remember, will be provided on GitHub.\nNow, we've covered a little bit of theory already.\nSo, how do we even get started?\nWell, here's the steps.\nNumber one, you need to go to Google Cloud Console and create a new project.\nThe window will look something like this.\nYou can see that I've created a new project here called ADK Data Cam Crash Course and just simply create.\nIt should look something like this window.\nSo you can see that this is my Google cloud console and I've selected the ADK data cam crash course.\nHere is my user profile and here's the rest of the details.\nThen number two, you have to select this project in our console.\nMost likely when you're first getting started, you wouldn't have selected this project.\nSo it is vital that you go onto the notifications part and you select this project.\nTo confirm that you are working on this project, it should say you are working in and the name of your project.\nIn my case, ADK data cam crash course.\nNumber three, head over to Google AI Studio.\nIt should look something like this.\nAnd then you have to go and create an API key.\nSo to do that, you need to go to this screen.\nThis is my Google AI studio page.\nYou can see I've already signed into my account.\nAnd I have to get the API key here and create an API key.\nAnd then I have to type in my Google Cloud project.\nNow this is very important step.\nMake sure to select the right Google cloud project.\nOtherwise, well, you wouldn't be able to use this.\nOnce you've created your API key and you've saved it in your project, you need to save this in your env file as stated in step five.\nNow, don't worry.\nThis API key, although mine is shown, I will delete this after the tutorial because otherwise hugger bankrupt.\nThe next step once you've done all of that is you have to clone this GitHub repository.\nAnd lastly, you need to pip install the requirements.txt file.\nOnce you've done that and you are successful, you're all set to go and I'll see you in the next section where we build our very first agent.\nAll right, people.\nSo, welcome to the very first agent we will be building.\nAnd I like to call it the welcome agent.\nThis is the first agent we'll be building.\nAnd to get started, I want to go with a little bit of theory, but this will be brief, I promise.\nSo the most important thing in Google ADK, especially when you're using something called ADK web and ADK CLI, we'll be covering this in just a bit, is the folder structure.\nNow you can see in this readme file which I've written here, you can see that this is quite important and this is a lot more important in Google ADK than compared to other agentic frameworks.\nSo the following folder structure you have to preserve at all costs.\nSo this folder structure helps you set up the basic organization for your agent project.\nIt creates a folder named multi-tool agent as you can see here and adds three files inside it: the init py, the agent py, and the env.\nI want to take just a few seconds defining what each of these files do.\nNumber two agent. py.\nThis is where our main logic and the code for our agent will be.\nAnd number three is the env file.\nAnd again, this is a hidden file for storing environment variables such as API keys or configuration settings that your agent might need.\nNow, make sure to have this structure because this is essential.\nOtherwise, well, it won't work.\nAnd this will also make it easier to maintain and build our agents.\nNow, I just want to quickly show you what the ENV file should look like.\nSo, this is how the ENV file should look like.\nFor the first few agents, you only need two keys here.\nNumber one, you need to specify Google Gen AI use vertex AI is false.\nThe reason this is false is one, this is beyond the scope of this video.\nAnd if you're a little bit interested, number two, Vert.ex AI is really used to deploy stuff to the cloud, which is a slightly beyond the scope of this video.\nAnd then you need to have your Google API key, which you got from the Google AI studio at the introduction of this tutorial.\nPerfect.\nSo now that we've covered that, we'll now jump into the code and talk about it a little bit more.\nOkay, so this is the welcome agents Python file.\nNow you can see that I've imported two main things.\nNumber one, from Google.k.agents import agent and number two from Google.ai import types.\nNow I'll be talking about this one in just a second.\nBut for starters, this now one more thing to note.\nYou should have no errors when install when defining these variables.\nIf you have set everything up correctly in the introduction, this should work flawlessly.\nIf you haven't, make sure to pip install the requirements.txt file.\nThat is a common mistake and I certainly have made that mistake quite a lot of times.\nSo, back into this first line.\nRemember when I said there are three types of agents?\nWell, there is the base class which is agent itself.\nNow, because we're using an LLM under the hood, we could have written LLM agent here or agent.\nYou can see even in the hint, it says agent is equal to LLM agent.\nSo, if I write LLM agent here or just agent, it doesn't really matter.\nThe code will still work regardless.\nEvery time we define an agent in Google ADK and we are going to be using ADK web and ADK CLI, there are a lot of things you need to keep in mind.\nNumber one, the name of the agent.\nIn this case, I've kept this as welcome agent.\nAnd you can see in the comment, it says name of our AI agent.\nThis is also important to define each agent's identity.\nNumber two is the model itself.\nIf it's an LLM-based agent or agent in general, you will have an LLM as the baseline model.\nIn this case, because of the Gemini API we copied, we're going to be using Gemini 2.0 Flash.\nNow, don't worry.\nThis is completely free because all of this code will run in the free tier.\nYou should have also noticed when you were in the introduction section that it didn't really ask for your credit card or any band details.\nSo don't worry you it won't cost you a thing.\nOkay.\nNumber three, a description.\nSo this is like stated in the parameter.\nIt's a brief description of the agent.\nAnd we're just going to say it's a simple greeting agent.\nAnd number four, the instruction.\nNow this is one of the more important parts.\nThis parameter you have to clearly define what the agent's action are.\nSo detail thing the agent has to do.\nThese are really the four main things you need to look out for.\nBut there are some more things you can change and that's where this line comes in.\nYou can see that in the comments I written for further configuration controls.\nNow what exactly does that mean?\nWell, if you're building slightly more complicated AI agents, you might want to have more control over the agent itself.\nAnd if you've used OpenAI models before or come from any other agent framework, you might have seen for example the top P parameter, top K parameter, temperature etc.\nAnd you can do something similar in Google ADK as well.\nSo if I press this hint here, you will see that it says the additional content generation configurations.\nSo for example, I have created two main parameters here: temperature and max output tokens.\nNow max output tokens is kind of obvious what it will be.\nThe agent can only output at a max of 250 tokens.\nIf you don't know what tokens are, don't worry.\nThink of them as a subword for example and temperature I have set to 0.2.\nNow temperature is something which defines the creativity of the agent's output.\nSo the closer you are to zero, the more deterministic output it will be.\nAnd the final thing which I need you to understand is that when you're using Google ADK, especially the CLI and the web version, you have to define a root agent.\nNow, you will see why in just a second, but you might be confused here.\nWhat even is Google ADK CLI and Google ADK web?\nWell, that's what we're about to do now.\nIf I quickly activate my virtual environment like such.\nOkay.\nSo if I type in ADK, you should see something like this.\nThis is a clear indication that everything you've installed is correct.\nNow you can see there's a little bit of information as to what ADK is.\nThere is API server create and so on.\nThe two main things we'll be looking at in this tutorial will be run and web.\nSo let's get started with running it on the command line interface or in your terminal.\nSo how do you run this in your terminal or your command line interface?\nWell, you write the ADK run and then you need to specify something and that is the name of the folder.\nSo the name of the folder here was welcome agent.\nSo I need to type welcome agent and if I run that you can see that I get this screen.\nNow it's saying user is equal to this.\nSo now it's prompting me to enter something.\nSo let's say hi and as you can see welcome agent has specified hello there how can I help you today.\nNow please note that we didn't specifically ask this conversation history like this user welcome agent.\nWe didn't specify that anywhere in this code.\nGoogle ADK internally did that.\nSo that's quite awesome.\nNow if you want to confirm this is Google ADK itself.\nLet me just clear aborted and clear this.\nAnd let me specify something fun like talk to me in a pirate manner.\nPerfect.\nNow again I'm putting this in the instruction because this is how the agent should speak or a particular action it should perform.\nSo if I run this code again and I ask it h who made you and I press enter you can see that the reply is in well pirate language.\nOh matey gone so on so on so on and you can also see it's specified Google meaning this is Gemini model we are using so remember one thing which I said earlier about root agent well I want to prove that root agent the name itself is quite important so if I clear this and I change this to something like Bob agent something completely random and I go back to this screen and I type in ADK run welcome agent remember it's not the name of this agent, it's the name of the folder.\nAnd I press enter.\nYou can see that I've got an error and it says module welcome agent.agent has no attribute root agent.\nSo this clearly specifies that we need a root agent.\nSo if I write root root agent here, clear this and run this again, this will work once more\n\n\nSo let's try that.\nHi, how are you doing?\nOver mat and so on and so on.\nPerfect.\nNow what was the second thing I said?\nADK web.\nNow ADK web is quite awesome.\nSo if I type in ADK web and this time I don't need to specify any particular agent and I press enter.\nWe'll see that this appears.\nNow I have to go on to HTTP localhost 8000 and I press it and we get to this screen.\nNow this screen is quite awesome.\nSo you can select your agents.\nIn your case, if you're coding this from complete scratch, you won't see anything like this.\nThis is just my virtual environment, but all of these are agents we will be covering.\nSo don't worry.\nNow, what was the agents called?\nThe folders name we were working on.\nThat was the welcome agent.\nSo we select welcome agent.\nAnd wow, this was automatically created.\nNow we can enable token streaming or on and off, but we'll keep it on cuz it's better.\nAnd you will see there's a lot of stuff to take in.\nThere's events, state, artifacts, sessions, eval session ID.\nWhat is going on?\nDon't worry, throughout this tutorial, it will make more sense.\nBut for now, I want to keep a conversation going.\nSo again, I'll say, \"Hi, how are you?\" and try to guess what it will say.\nWell, something similar what it will say.\nOf course, you can't guess what it's actually going to say probably, but again, the key answer I wanted was the pirate theme cuz remember, we didn't change the instruction at all.\nSo this is the same underlying model as we ran in the command line interface.\nNow I know I'm going a bit slow but this is important.\nIt's important to note what your base model is.\nWhat's going on with the agent flow?\nBecause when we go on to build more complicated agent things tend to get messy.\nSo that's why we're going step by step.\nNow if you look on the left hand side there's events state artifact sessions and eval.\nNow artifacts and eval are beyond the scope of this video but events you can see that as soon as this came up with an answer this was created.\nSo let's take a look at what this is.\nIf we select this we can see that we have a welcome agent and it has the respective parts aka the output and you can see this was the role by the model aka the underlying agent welcome agent.\nThe thing I love most about this ADK web is its clean interface and I hope you like it more and more as the tutorial goes on because it becomes especially helpful when you have more than one agent running.\nNow if we go into the request part, this was what the instructions are.\nRemember I wrote you're a helpful assistant that greets the user.\nTalk to me in a pirate manner.\nThis was the instruction by me.\nBut Google ADK internally gives us this message as well.\nAdds this to the instruction.\nYou're an agent, your internal name is welcome agent and so on and so on.\nAnd you can see that the contents was hi, how are you role user and this was the request.\nSo all of this makes up the request.\nSo the underlying model, the system instruction, the temperature, max output tokens, the my actual request and my role are all the request in this Google ADK framework.\nAnd the response, well, you guessed it, it will be this.\nAs you can see, aoy matey, that's the response.\nAnd the role was model and this was an event.\nNow I want to talk a bit more about this.\nSo let's go back into the theory.\nPerfect.\nSo we covered until this point but we just went through ADK run and ADK web.\nSo let's just quickly look into that a bit more.\nSo ADK run like you just saw was the primary command line tool to run our agents locally.\nIt instantly launches our agent for direct interaction in our terminal.\nAnd we created the pirate mode where we uh were able to have the agent speak in a pirate themed language.\nNow, ADK web on the other hand spinned up a web interface for our agent.\nIt lets us chat with our agent in a modern web browser UI.\nThe web browser UI, the underlying API which we're using is Flask.\nThe modern web browser UI is provided by the underlying API Flask API and is really great for demos, sharing or more visual experience.\nNow I'm going to go back to the ADK web section.\nAnd I'm back here.\nAnd now I'm going to ask it, tell me a joke.\nNow there's a reason I'm doing this.\nAnd there we go.\nSome rubbish joke.\nBut now I'm going to ask it, what did I just ask you?\nAnd if this runs,\nShiver me timbers, you just asked this whatever a joke to tickle your funny bone.\nSo in a pirate theme language, it's clearly saying that I just asked it to tell a joke.\nNow there's two things I want you to notice here.\nNumber one, I never created any conversational history.\nThat means Google ADK has inbuilt conversational memory, which is quite awesome because in other frameworks, I need to specifically build this especially in Langraph if you come from a langraph uh base.\nNumber two, notice how every time I send a request, it creates an event here.\nSo this was the the treasure joke here.\nAnd if I go to event three, it was shiver me timbers.\nWhat I asked?\nWhat did I just ask you?\nThis part.\nSo you can go through and flip through all of these events.\nAnd again, it's highlighted green, the welcome agent, because well, this is the underlying agent we're using.\nAnd if you go on to the request and response, you can see it also changes based on what the request and response were respectively.\nSo have a play at this.\nIt's quite cool.\nBut going back to the theory, you can see that I've created an inbuilt conversational memory.\nAnd like I said, the agent automatically remembers the previous messages in the section, provides context to the AI, making conversations more coherent and context aware, and no extra setup needed like I mentioned.\nBut there are two things which we haven't really discussed in depth.\nAnd this will become more clearer as we go into the tutorial.\nBut just to really get them started, session is a series of messages exchanged between the user and the AI agent.\nAnd each session maintains its own conversational context.\nAn event are activities or actions that have occurred during a session.\nSo they're useful for tracking, logging, or triggering specific behaviors.\nSo that my friends was the first agent, the welcome agent.\nWe're now going into our second agent.\nSo our second agent will contain something known as tools.\nNow again if you come from an agentic framework background you know how important tools are but if you don't let's quickly define what a tool is.\nSo a tool is a modular component that extends an AI agents capabilities beyond just simple text generation.\nSo tools enable agents to perform specific actions, interact with external systems and process real world data dynamically.\nFor example, it could check the weather, search the web, do math calculations, booking a flight, etc.\nNow, one thing to note here is that the LLM coupled with a tool, that's what really makes an agent.\nThat is a very very basic, naive definition, but you can think of an agent as that way.\nIf I if I gave my LLM a task to check the weather, well, it wouldn't be able to do it.\nIt will probably hallucinate and get it completely wrong because it doesn't have the real world data update.\nSo what are the characteristics of tools?\nNumber one, it has to be actionorientated.\nTools execute predefined tasks such as retrieving data like the weather report, stock prices I just mentioned.\nNumber two, it extends the agents functionality.\nAgents leverage tools to overcome limitations of static training data by accessing live information.\nAgain, going back to the weather tool I just gave, it had it would have no idea what the current weather is without the tool because it would just hallucinate.\nAnd number three and this is quite important the deterministic execution.\nTools follow strict logic defined by us developers unlike the agents LLM which handles reasoning.\nNow this doesn't mean you can't have LLMs baked into tools.\nOf course you can.\nBut tools should give a more deterministic output.\nSo what are the benefits of using tools in the first place?\nWell realtime data access, task automation and scalability.\nNow there are different types of tools here and if you want a full comprehensive detailed list you can go onto the official ADK tool documentation but there are three main tools to look out for.\nFunction tools these are custom tools defined by us developers.\nBuilt-in tools which are predefined tools for common tasks such as web search code execution.\nNow these are tools which are provided by Google themselves which we can use in our code.\nSo these are plug-and-play tools.\nAnd number three third party tools.\nThese are integrations with external services such as Slack.\nNow, that was a lot of theory.\nSo, let's go into the code.\nAgain, you can see that I've defined the tool agent folder as the file, the folder structure I mentioned in the introduction.\nThis is very, very important, especially if you're using ADK CLI and ADK web.\nOkay, so this is the code.\nAnd right off the bat, you can see I've imported the same line again.\nNow, forget this comment for now.\nThis is a custom tool we'll get into shortly.\nBut if we go down here, you can see that I imported Google search.\nNow, just before in the theory, I mentioned Google search was an in-built tool.\nSo, we can really just use this and well, plug and play with it.\nSo, just to quickly go over all of the root agents parameters again, we have the name basic search agent, the same underlying model, what this agent can do, a description of it, and in the instruction, I can answer your questions by searching the internet.\nJust ask me anything.\nAnd again, Google search is a pre-built tool which allows the agent to perform Google searches.\nAnd this is a new parameter tools is equal to Google search.\nAnd Google search, you can see, is the exact tool we just imported.\nSo now let's run ADK web again by closing.\nOh, we don't need to close this actually.\nLet's go to ADK web.\nNow I can create a new session here.\nNew session.\nYou can see all the events, the state, artifacts, everything is cleared.\nAnd these are the two sessions.\nIf I want to go back to the previous section session, I can just go back like this.\nNow going back to here, we need to select the tool agent, which is this.\nSo let's say, hi, who are you?\nI'm an agent designed to answer your questions using Google sub.\nMy internal name is basic search, the exact name we just gave it.\nSo let's ask it something like, uh, tell me the current stock price of Apple.\nA cliche example, I know, but you can see what what was going to happen.\nAs of July 13, 2025, which is today's date, and again, the LLM, if it was just the LLM without a tool, it would have no clue what the current date is and the current stock price.\nAnd you can see it's the $211.16.\nSo, this is obviously right.\nBut the thing to note here is if I go into the event, which is this, you can see that the event the agent has changed.\nIt's basic search agent and Google search.\nNow I can scroll through the events here.\nSo this was the initial message.\nHi, who are you?\nAnd then this was for tell me the current stock price of Apple.\nYou can see the events are chronological.\nNow there is one caveat here.\nRemember Google ADK is still developing.\nSo if you selected a tool, this should ideally go green.\nBut sometimes it doesn't.\nGoogle search this inbuilt tool especially sometimes doesn't go green.\nIf it goes green, it means that it is using that agent or tool just for your reference.\nBut this is still correct.\nAnd I'll prove this to you why this is correct.\nIf I go back to the code and I don't give it this tool and I press save and I go back to ADK web and I refresh and I clear this screen and I press ADK web and I select tool agent again.\nI can now ask it what is the current stock price of Apple?\nSame question but take a look at this.\nYou can see that instead of giving me the actual output, it gave me Python code and you can see that I don't have any tool provided here.\nSo that's why under the hood although it didn't go green here the Google search if I don't provide a Google search it doesn't know how to execute it properly.\nSo that's one thing to note.\nGoing back to the code here now.\nI'm going to comment this bit out and I'm going to uncomment this out.\nOkay.\nSo now this is a custom tool I've created.\nGet contact.\nNow there are a lot of things to note here.\nSo let's go them go through one by one.\nThis is the parameter.\nIt must take a person's name and it has to be in the format of a string and it should output the answer or return whatever as a dictionary.\nAnd you can see specifying the return type.\nNow, here's the most important part when it comes to custom tools, the dock string.\nAnd the dock string is what the agent determines what the function does.\nSo, in this case, the get contact tool gets the contact details of the chosen person.\nIts arguments are person, which is a string, and that's the name of the person whose contact you want, and it returns a dictionary.\nNow, this is the industry standard of creating dock strings.\nYou will see this quite often in all of documentation and tutorials.\nSo it's good practice to start writing your dock strings as this.\nAnd lastly, we have to return it.\nSo it has to be return contact person's number is 1 2 3 4 5.\nI have hardcoded the number here.\nI could have also specified another parameter, but we're keeping things simple.\nNow you can see that the description has changed tool agent and this is tool custom agent.\nSo the name has changed, but it's still under the same file.\nI've commented the rest out and the tool I've specified is get contact.\nSo now if I refresh ADK web and now I type in hi what is your name?\nYou can see that it says I'm a tool agent which was the name we gave it.\nNow we can ask it something like could you tell me what Tom's number is please?\nSo now hopefully it should use the custom tool and there you go.\nIt used the get contact tool and Tom's number is 1 2 3 4 5.\nI mean, everyone's number is 1 2 3 4 5, but you get the point.\nNow, here's the cool part.\nIf I go into events, which is here, starting with the first event, so this was event number one.\nWhat was your name and it gave us I'm a tool agent.\nAgain, it's green here because that's all it used.\nIt didn't use a tool here.\nIf I go to number second event, you can see that after I asked it what Tom\n\n\n's number is, please,\nit did use get contact the tool which we\ndefined earlier.\nAnd we can scroll to event three.\nYou can see how the arrow is changing as well.\nSo this was from agent to tool, and this was from the tool's response back to the agent, and the event four, which was the output, where it doesn't need the tool anymore.\nIt gives us the final answer, which was Tom's number is 1 2 3 4 5.\nAnd that's what we saw here, and that's what we saw in the web.\nSo this is why Google ADK web is quite awesome because, well, when it is working, it clearly gives us a visualization of what is going under the hood.\nSuper, super awesome and super easy to get up and running.\nAnd that, people, was the second agent we've built.\nSo we've already built two agents.\nSo well done.\nWe're now going to be moving into a third agent, something known as structured outputs.\nSo structured outputs, what are they?\nWell, normally a language model might reply with text like John's numbers 1 2 3 4 5.\nBut what if we want something more cleaner like name John, contact 1 2 3 4 5?\nIt's more cleaner, more structured.\nStructured is the key word here.\nNow, there are many reasons why we would want this, such as it being used in code and making it more readable and structured.\nWe want, we might need to save it in a database.\nWe might need to pass it between agents.\nSo Google ADK lets us force the agent to reply in this clean format using something known as output schema.\nNow there are two types of schemas in most agentic frameworks and also in Google ADK: the input and the output schema.\nSo the input schema is what the user AK and me must send.\nSo it should be a particular format.\nAnd number two, the output schema.\nThis forces the agent to output in a particular structure.\nIt could be something like this, for example.\nNow we define these using pyantic models.\nNow if you don't know what pyantic is, that is completely fine.\nIt doesn't matter.\nJust think of pyantic as a library under the hood which allows us to build these schematics.\nIf you want to see a tutorial about padantic, leave a comment down in below.\nSo you can see from pyantic import base model field, and the input format should be like this, and the output format should be like this.\nNow we'll talk a bit more about this pyantic code in, well, in the code.\nSo I'll see you there.\nOkay.\nSo this is the code for our third agent, and we're going to be mainly specifying about output schema, cuz that's what's really commonly used.\nSo here the new line which we've imported, and what we just saw in the introduction of this section was this pantic line, and again, it's a library to define the schematics.\nSo to define the output structure, we have to have the class inheriting the base model.\nYou don't really need to know what it is.\nThe main line which you do need to know is this: greeting colon string.\nSo this means that the structured output must have a greeting which is under a string, and this is a type field, and it will have a description.\nEach of these parameters will have a short description which will tell what the tell the LLM what it's about.\nSo this is just a simple greeting message to the person.\nSo the root agent has been defined like normally.\nThere is no such tool needed here.\nBut there are two new parameters: output schema, which is greeting output, and this makes sure that this is outputed as a structured output, which is defined by this pyantic structure, and the output key final greeting.\nWe'll talk more about this parameter in just a bit.\nBut if you look at the instruction, it says give a person's name, respond with a JSON output like this.\nNow, it's really sometimes helpful to also give in the instruction some more information about how we want the output to be.\nYes, we've got the structured output, but this sometimes really helps it and completely enforces the LLM to output it in this way.\nSo, that's just a helpful tip.\nNow if I go and run ADK web again using ADK web and I select the structured output agent here and allow token streaming, we can say something like, hey, nice to meet you Tom, and if we press enter, it should give us in the structured output like we wanted: greeting hello Tom.\nNow there's nowhere I wrote hello Tom, it automatically gave it like the structured output like we wanted.\nNow this was obviously a simple example, but hopefully you can see how important structured outputs are, especially when we're saving it to a database or saving the result and passing it to another agent or a tool.\nSo structured outputs are quite important.\nIf we go into the event, we can see that this is exactly what we want here, and there is no such tool here because, well, the structured output or the pyantic base class we created, that's not a tool, is a schematic.\nSo that's completely different from a tool.\nBut if I go back to the code now, remember I mentioned this line: output key is equal to final greeting.\nWell, what was this about?\nIf I go back to the ADK web folder, the ADK web file, and I go into state, you can see that I've saved this in the state.\nNow, we'll be talking what state is in just a bit, but that is how you can save things into a state, making your agent stateful.\nNow, we will cover the state in slightly more depth in just a second, but that's really it for this section.\nShort, brief section, but I hopefully you've understood how important structured outputs are.\nNow, I'll see you in the fourth section.\nNow, this will be a very simple agent, but with slightly different perspective.\nWe're going to be using other LLM providers, specifically OpenAI.\nNow, you can use whatever LLM provider you want.\nIf you go onto the documentation here, you can find a list of models you can use.\nThe most common models I've seen when developers are developing using Google ADK, although remember this is still quite new, is really OpenAI and anthropic models.\nI'll be going for the OpenAI model here, but you can also go for anthropic as well.\nOkay, so to do this, if you had installed the requirements or .txt file, you should not need to do this.\nBut if you didn't, you just need to pip install light LLM, which is just a module in Google ADK, which allows us to talk to other LLM providers.\nIf you want to get access to OpenAI, you need to create an OpenAI API key.\nAnd to do this, you need to go into the OpenAI platform and create a new secret key.\nNow, this will cost you money.\nI think the minimum error amount is $5, but if you don't want to, you can just simply watch this video and keep this in the back of your mind.\nSo, but this will be quite quick.\nSo if you go to the code now, which is this, the only new thing which I've added was is this line from Google ADK models.lm import lightn.\nNow one thing to note is the openi API key or the anthropic API key must go into your env file as well.\nI'm not going to show you the env file, otherwise my API key will be exposed, and again, I will go bankrupt.\nNow defining the light LLM models, you have to structure it like this.\nSo you write lightm and then the model.\nSo your model name provider, in this case, I'm open, and the name of the model GPD4 mini.\nYou can't simply write GPD4 mini or GBD4.\nIt wouldn't work.\nIt'll throw you an error.\nSimilarly, if you were using claude, it would be anthropic/cl, for example.\nNow the root agent is again quite simple.\nWe're going to again talk like a pirate and we will generate a social media post about it.\nWe're going to keep it concise, relevant, and easy to understand.\nActually, if it's easy to understand, we shouldn't be talking to like a pirate.\nBut the main thing here is now we've specified the model to be a light lm model.\nSo this time, let's run it in our command line.\nSo we can do ADK run and the name of the folder.\nIn this case, the name of the folder is OpenAI agent.\nSo open AI agent.\nAnd I press enter.\nAnd now we can talk to our open AI model.\nSo we can say hi, who made you.\nLet's say who made you,\nand you can see the light agent is using GPT4 mini provider OpenAI, and it says hi there, I was created by a team of researchers at OpenAI.\nNow this obviously shows that it's not Google because Google wouldn't say this, right?\nBut this was a very short subsection to really show you that you can use other models as well.\nSo yeah, that was the end, and I'll see you in the next section.\nOkay, so now we're getting into slightly more complicated territory, and we're going to start this off with sequential agents.\nNow, this will be the very first time we get to build multiple agents in one go.\nSo, what are sequential agents?\nWell, they're agents that work in a chain, one after another.\nSo, how do they work?\nWell, each agent passes its output to the next agent.\nAnd why do we use them?\nWell, break complex task into simple, more manageable steps.\nEach of these simpler, more manageable steps will be completed by one agent respectively.\nSo an example we'll be coding up is the recipe.\nSo we'll have three agents.\nOne will be the research agent which finds ingredients and the methods, and we will give it the Google search tool.\nNumber two will be the creator agent which writes the recipe, and number three will be the enhancement agent which adds tips and variations to this.\nSo it'll be quite a cool agentic system we're about to build.\nSo the result should be a really detailed, sophisticated output than what a single agent would have completed in one trial.\nSo this is a diagram which I created, and you can see that there are three agents: agent 1, 2, and three.\nAnd it's not necessary that the agents have the same tools.\nThey could have different tools.\nThey might not need a tool.\nSo this diagram hopefully tells you that the number of tools is unique to each and every agent.\nIt doesn't influence the other agents output unless if there's an error, obviously, but TLDDLR, you can think of this as a chain of agents.\nSo let's now go into the code.\nIt looks like there's a lot of code here, but in reality, it's just the instructions inflating the amount of code lines there are.\nSo don't get, don't panic here.\nSo like I just mentioned, we need to create a recipe research agent which finds ingredients and the cooking methods.\nSo we've given it the name, the tool Google search, because remember it should be able to access the internet to give it as some good recipes.\nUm, and this is just an instruction: culinary researcher, etc.\nYou get the point.\nAnd the output key, we want to save it to our state as recipe research.\nThe second agent we want to create is the recipe creator agent which actually creates the recipe itself.\nNow again, this will use the same model as we have before, the same underlying LLM, and we've given it a name and its respective instructions, description, and the output key aka state uh parameter it's going to save as, and the third agent which we wanted to create was a recipe enhancement agent, again using the same LLM as the uh background model and these instructions and everything, but you can see that we have now given it a context variable, this thing in yellow and curly brackets.\nWe'll talk more about context variables in just a second.\nBut uh for, but for reference, you can think of context variables as like an input which needs to be passed to this agent's instructions, and this will obviously come from the previous uh agent, and the previous agent was a recipe creator agent.\nSo to create a sequential agent system, you you need to use the sequential agent part, and I've named it recipe development system, and a simple system that researches, creates, and enhances recipes.\nA short description, you don't need to provide an instruction here.\nIt's completely fine.\nBut this parameter is sub aents.\nRemember how we created tools?\nWell, sub aents kind of work like that.\nYou need to specify all the sub aents you have in order.\nSo, recipe research agent, recipe creator agent, recipe enhancement agent in sequence.\nNow, let's run this in ADK web.\nSo, I'll quickly write ADK web here, and I'll again press token streaming and go into sequential agent.\nOkay.\nNow, let's say hi, I want to create a recipe regarding chicken pasta sauce.\nYou can tell I'm a professional chef.\nAnd some other ingredients.\nRecommend me something.\nAll right, let's see what the agent says.\nSo, here's a breakdown of popular chicken pasta recipes.\nAnd you can see the chicken preparation and everything which is happening.\nThat's event one and event two.\nOkay, based on the research uh research for creamy tuskcen chicken pasta, and number three, this is the final recipe.\nSo we're, as soon as this output finishes, we will talk about this in slightly more depth.\nWow, that's a lot.\nAnd that's the end of the request.\nOkay, let's go back here.\nThis is the first output, and the first output was provided by our first agent.\nIf we go onto the event zero or the first event and press it, you can see that we have the recipe development system, and we have the three agents: recipe research agent, recipe creator agent, and recipe enhancement agent.\nAnd you can also see that the recipe research agent has the Google search tool with it.\nAnd because this is green, we use the Google search tool to come up with a recipe or to find a recipe.\nAnd the recipe it found based on all of the parameters and ingredients I told it to.\nIt came up with creamy tuskcen chicken pasta.\nNow we go on to the second agent, which was this response.\nSo this was the first response, and now this is the second response.\nAnd you can also see, okay, based on the research which was provided by the research agent.\nNow if I press the next agent, you can see that it's gone green here.\nIt doesn't have any tool cuz we didn't give it access to any tools.\nAnd this was its output, which is the exact same as here.\nYou can see, okay, based on, okay, based on the research, here's a recipe, and this the same thing as we can see here.\nAnd again, if we go into the third one, we can go into event three, and this is highlighted as green, meaning that this is the agent which is running here, and this gives us the final thing with cooking tips and variations as well and some more suggestions as well.\nSo last thing which I want to show you in this example is the state, and you can see that every time an agent completed its task, I also told it to save it as a state.\nSo the recipe researchers final answer was here.\nThe final recipe is here as well.\nSo the research and the final recipe is all being recorded in the state.\nAnd this allows us to create stateful agents.\nAnd we can use this in further conversations.\nAnd this state will come especially useful when we use in-memory service and persistent storage.\nThese two terms we will be\n\n\nGoing into shortly.\nBut just remember we have now saved this as state.\nYou should now know how uh sequential agents work, how they look like, how they're visualized.\nYou should also find that it's really simple to create these sequential agents in Google ADK.\nI mean, if we go back to the code and I close this, you can see that all I had to do was define the um agents like this and just write the sub agents and well, we created a sequential agent.\nNow, what's the opposite of a sequential agent?\nWell, the opposite of a sequence, well, it's parallel.\nSo is there a way we can run these agents parallelly or at the same time?\nWell, that's what we will be exploring in the next section.\nOkay, so now let's talk about parallel agents.\nWhat exactly are they?\nWell, simply put, they're agents that work simultaneously all at the same time.\nSo how do they work?\nThey run in parallel, hence the name.\nBut the crucial thing to note is that they complete their tasks independently.\nBut why do we use them?\nWell, that's also quite obvious.\nWe it speeds up complicated tasks by doing multiple things at once.\nSo the example we'll be coding in this time uh will be a travel planning system and it will contain three agents.\nNumber one, it will contain a hotel agent which will search for accommodation options, the restaurant agent which will find dining experiences and the activities agent which discovers things to do.\nThe result should be hopefully a system which produces faster completion and more comprehensive results from multiple sources.\nNow, TLDDR, if you uh want to skip, it's just think of them as agents working side by side.\nAnd I created a diagram here to hopefully illustrate that.\nYou have your first agent or it could be an input query by the user.\nAnd you have your parallel agents working at the same time independently.\nAnd they can have uh one tool, two tools, no tools, it doesn't it doesn't matter.\nThey're completing tasks independently.\nMeaning their tool allocation or the number of tools they each have is independent.\nAll right.\nSo, I'll see you in the code.\nOkay.\nSo, here's the code.\nHonestly, once we go through it, you will see that it's largely the same as the sequential agent which we covered in the last section.\nThe only key difference here is this keyword, which is a parallel agent.\nWe swapped it out for the sequential agent keyword.\nBut you will see that there's these two lines input OS and this open telemetry package.\nThe reason I've included this here is because I was personally having quite some trouble running this on ADK web.\nIt runs completely fine on ADK CLI.\nIt also runs fine on ADK web except the interface part where it shows which agent is running at once.\nThat is a bit buggy.\nSo that's I did some research.\nIt's to do with something called open telemetry.\nIt's not really to do with um Google ADK.\nIt's the internal asyncio package.\nSo even if you run this in CLI, you don't need to use it.\nI just put a rotor here because some of you might use this on ADK web and it might not work.\nSo that's why I've included this here.\nRemember Google ADK is still a library which is under development and its updates are happening daily.\nSo be cautious about that.\nBut let's continue with the code now.\nSo remember I mentioned that there will be three agents.\nThe first agent is the hotel search agent which is has a name, the model and the tools.\nEach of these tools each of these agents will have one tool which is Google search.\nThe description is as follows and you can see the instruction as well.\nThe output key I want to save it in the state hotel options.\nSimilarly, the restaurant agent is quite similar as well.\nAlmost exactly the same.\nIt's just it's specific to restaurants.\nAnd again, the same thing with activities.\nNow, the main difference between the previous sections code is here.\nRather than coding it as a sequential agent system, we've got it as a parallel agent system.\nAnd the sub agents are these three.\nWe've got a short description of what's happening, what this system is supposed to do and we've got the name of the system as travel planning system.\nNow if you run this on ADK uh CLI or command line interface, I've already run it for you to like save some time and here you can see that I have written hi can you give me recommendations for your respective things for my trip to London.\nSo I'm planning a trip to London.\nI want this travel planning system which is this entire system of parallel agents to be able to provide me with hotels activities and restaurants.\nSo if you look closely you can see that this is the restaurant search agents response.\nSo you can see here is a summary of dining recommendations for your trip to London.\nAnd notice how all of this is specific to restaurants.\nIt's not conflicting with the hotel outputs or activity outputs because all of these tasks run independently.\nSimilarly, once that's done, then we have the hotel search agent which also ran at the same time and this was specific to hotels.\nAnd lastly, you can see that there is the activity search agent uh which has produced some activities such as going to Buckingham Palace, some outdoor activities and all of these agents use the Google search tool internally.\nSo that was the final output.\nNow this was quite simple and really to build upon this I have a little bit of a homework task for you.\nOkay homework.\nSo to really consolidate this I want you to take our parallel agent system which you can get on GitHub again and then add another agent at the end of it so that it takes all of the three inputs and summarizes everything to the user.\nIt should look something like this diagram which I've made.\nNow why do I want a summary agent?\nWell, if you just saw this was well a lot of information and if you have more than three agents for example, it could get quite overwhelming quite quickly.\nSo your task is to create this sort of uh agentic system.\nThe user will request something like I did about the London thing which I requested uh here something similar to that and then the three agents will run parallelly.\nThey will all have uh their Google search internal tool and all of their outputs will be then passed to the summary agent.\nSo this is the agentic system you need to make as the homework.\nOnce you've done that, I will see you in the next section.\nSo in this section, we'll be talking about session agents.\nNow here's where we start moving towards memory.\nThis is going to be quite complicated and this is quite advanced as well.\nSo it's fun, but be prepared.\nReady?\nHere we go.\nSo before we dive in, two quick notes.\nNumber one, sessions are quite important.\nWe've mentioned sessions quite a lot of times already, but now we'll actually define it.\nAnd number two, we won't always be using ADK web and ADK run and ADK CLI, especially not in production.\nSo let's try to come up with a way which we can run our agents without having to use the ADK web or ADK run package.\nSo let's define session.\nHonestly, you can think of a session as a conversational thread attached to a specific user.\nAnd a state, which is also something we've mentioned before, is a Python dictionary representing session memory or the bot's context.\nSo at the create time, we initialize values the agent might need and it includes temporary flags, user preferences, conversion steps, etc.\nAll of these are things which the state might include.\nHere we talk about three more uh components and I've tried to give it as a chef analogy.\nSo hopefully it starts to make sense.\nNumber one is the agent.\nAnd in this analogy, you can think of it as the chef.\nThe agent wraps our language model with a prompt template.\nSo you can think of the chef who follows a recipe with blanks.\nExample, username, favorite color that gets filled in at runtime.\nHere, username and favorite color are context variables in our example code which we're about to see.\nAnd the crucial thing is the chef never forgets to read the recipe before cooking.\nSo remember that point.\nNext thing which I want to talk about is the session service and this is the notepad in our analogy.\nSo it stores per user per session state aka memory.\nSo it acts like a notepad where you jot down each user's preference counters or other context which might be important.\nAnd before every response the chef aka the agent it glances at the notepad to know what ingredients to use.\nThe final thing which we need to talk about is the runner.\nAnd in this analogy, the the it's been represented as a waiter.\nSo it orchestrates the entire flow.\nWhen the user sends a message, it grabs the correct notepad, hands it, and the users's order to the chef, and then brings back the chef's answer.\nYou can think of it as kind of like a messenger, and it ensures that the chef always works with the freshest information.\nNow, this might not mean much to you, but I promise you in the code, it will make a lot more sense.\nBut visually speaking, a runner can honestly be viewed as this.\nIt's really just a fusion of the session and the agent combined into one and it passes the information between the chef and the notepad aka the session service.\nNow going back to the session service, this is the most crucial point in Google ADK.\nThere are three main types of session services.\nThe first is in-memory session service.\nNow this stores all session data directly in the application's memory.\nSo it has no persistence.\nNow what does persistence mean?\nWell, it means that data is lost as soon as the application is closed.\nSo, let's say if I'm having a conversation with my agent and I just close the application, it won't remember what I just talked about if I reload the application because it's non-persistent.\nThe data is lost.\nSo, to combat that and to have persistent storage, there's two other methods.\nThe Vertex AI session service which uses Google Cloud's Vert.ex X AI infrastructure and we can communicate this with via API calls and this is used for session management and is persistent.\nSo it's best for scalable production applications deployed on Google cloud.\nNow this is slightly out of scope for this tutorial.\nBut the third one is what we'll be also using in the next section and that is database session service.\nSo that connects to a relational database example these databases and they store session data persistently in tables.\nNow, it's best used for applications needing reliable persistent storage that crucially you manage yourself.\nNow, the above information was all taken from this documentation.\nSo, if you want, you can click on this link and you can uh read more in depth about it.\nBut I built this visualization to try to help clear some doubts about what a session service is, especially if this is your first time hearing about it.\nImagine I am having a conversation with my agent.\nSo, this is me.\nI sent it a message and it needed to uh produce a use a tool and then it outputed.\nThen I sent another message and then it uh responded again and so on and so on.\nThis entire thing this state plus this conversation it counts as a session.\nNow you see this this is the unique identifier for the session.\nHow did I get this number or a string?\nI honestly just uh spam my keyboard.\nBut that's not the important part.\nThe important part here is the session consists of the state and the conversation.\nNow events are things like the user message tools agent responses and all of these user message tools and agent responses you see I just didn't draw arrows to all of them because then the diagram would become cluttered similarly you can see that another session has happened here and again what did we define a session as.\nIf we scroll up, we said session is a conversational thread attached to a specific user.\nMeaning that within our app, this could be one user, let's say person A, and then person B could be having a separate conversation conversational thread aka separate session with our agent.\nAnd all of this in is encompassed by the session service, which are these three session services we have available.\nThis is a little bit more description of how it works.\nWe've already gone uh through it, but now let's jump into the code and see how this actually plays out.\nSo now in this uh subsection, we're going to be using the in-memory session service.\nBut let's quickly look at all the imports we've done.\nNumber one, UU ID.\nThis is a library which is used to generate a unique session ID.\nRemember the uh the string which you saw where I span my keyboard.\nThat's what this library does for us.\nSo the second line is from Google.k.essions sessions import this service and again inmemory service is something which stores the user data it's one of the three session services we looked at then we already know what an agent is we discuss what a runner is these are the types and this is our envo API keys here perfect now we define our agent and I've called it chef to stay true to our analogy here and I've called it information agent and it's going to use Gemini as the underlying LLM but why have they called it information agent the main task of this agent is to have the instruction as the user's favorite color is this, their name is this and their favorite subject is this and then I have to the agent has to answer questions about it.\nSo it's quite a simple agent uh but it proves why these session services are quite important.\nSo again, this instruction which you saw here is a prompt template with placeholders also known as context variables filled using session state before each invocation.\nTo actually instantiate the session service, we use this inmemory.\nSession service is a session backend that stores conversational state in memory.\nSo you saw the diagram which we just saw where we were having conversation with our agent.\nUh that's what this will store but it's non-persistent.\nSo as soon as we close up the application, it will just go and disappear.\nNow we generate the unique session ID and we use that UYU ID library which we imported the first line.\nNow we create the session.\nSo we instantiated the service but now we actually create the new session for this user.\nSo the app name we'll call it information app.\nUh we'll say the user ID is my name Vev.\nthe session ID which we got from this and the state and this state will be passed to the agent via our runner and it will the agent will know okay this is the favorite color this is the user's name and this is their favorite subject so the runner aka which we have defined here is the manager that coordinates between the chef and the notebook hopefully things are starting to make sense but if it's not it's fine we'll proceed slower now we send a message aka the user message as you can see by here ro user and we've asked it what is my name and what color do I like so based on this it should really say the name is this and their favorite color is green okay and now here is this piece of code for EV and waiter run this is what the wait uh the waiter performs so let's talk a bit more about this so as soon as this for loop is executed the runner basically ret\n\n\nretrieves the session by user ID and\nsession ID now. Why? Because in this line\nyou can see here, waiter.run user ID is\npassed, the session ID is passed, and the\nnew message, which is this, is also\npassed. So that checks out. Then\ninternally, the placeholders, aka these\ncontext variables, which you saw here,\nare filled out with the state which\nwe've passed, which is these, okay? And\nthen the Gemini, uh, Gemini, which is our\nbase LM, which we define in the agent, uh,\nthat gets called, and then the final\noutput is respond is outputted, and we see\nthe message. Once that's all executed, we\nnow manually fetch that session from\nmemory so we can inspect its state, and\nthen we print the updated state. So\nlet's take a look at how this works. To\nrun this, I will just press the run\nbutton,\nand we've got our output. So you can see\nthe final session state is correct. It's\ngreen. It's my name, and it's mathematics\nwhich I passed. Where did I pass this\nagain? You can see, \"Hey, favorite color\nwas green. This was my name, and my\nfavorite subject is maths.\" Now this\npiece of code here was executed based on\nhere for event in writeer.run. So let's\nwalk through this a bit, 'cause this is\ngoing to be the part which might confuse\nyou. So here you can see that there is\nthe part here. Let me actually clear\nthis up. One second. Clear and run\nagain.\nYou can see that the text is \"Your name\nis Vera, and you like the color green.\"\nBut who came up with this? Well, that\nwas the underlying Gemini model. As you\ncan see, Gemini is called, and we got our\noutput. Now, why is there only a single\niteration here? You can see that I\nprinted this dash line to say when the\nfinal response is outputted. But\nrealistically, there was only a single\nevent which happened. Why? Because all I\nasked it to do was tell me what my name\nis and what my favorite color is. That\nstill only counts as one event. But here\nwe've printed the final response. And if\nthat has content, which it does, which\nthe content being this, we output that\nand we print it. And this line here is\nwhat you can see here. \"Your name is V of\nMER, and you like the color green.\" Now\nfor this final session state, it was\nprinted through this for loop. There\nwere three, uh, print statements. Uh, there\nwere three key-value pairs which were\nfavorite color, name, and favorite\nsubject. And that's what's being printed\nhere. So that's all well and good, but\nhere's a problem. So, let me clear this\nscreen, and let me go here, and let me\nchange my user message. Now, let's say,\n\"Can you also change my favorite color to\nred?\" Okay, still quite a basic question,\nbut watch what happens after I run this.\nYou can see from the response that it\nsays, \"However, I cannot change your\npreferences. I can only remember and use\nthe information you provide. You're free\nto like whatever color you want.\" Uh, so\nquite unhelpful, uh, response, and you can\nsee that the final session state is\nstill the exact same original sessions,\nuh, the original state we provided. So\nthat's a problem. Uh, and we've learned\nsomething at least, which is that the\nmodel can't modify the state by itself.\nSo we need a different way to be able to\nparse it. So how do we do that? Well,\nlet's brainstorm and go to the drawing\nboard. Things we can potentially do.\nOne, we can manually update the state\nourselves using something like this\npseudo code which I've provided. But\nhere's a problem. If we have many\ndifferent context variables, we're going\nto have to do this for every single one\nof them. And this will be quite long, and\nit will be prone to human errors. So the\nsecond option is we use the LLM, just\nthe LLM to return structured output, aka\nto return something which we can use and\npass to something else, something like\nthis. But there's a problem with this as\nwell, that this could be problematic\nbecause the LM outputs are stocastic, and\nwe would prefer something which is\ncompletely deterministic. So the third\nway is to use ADK tool calling or using\ntools. But this could be quite\ncomplicated to integrate. Wouldn't it be\nbetter if we had something simpler? So\nthe final option is using structured\noutputs where we can go for this since\nit's good practice, and we're building on\ntop of what we've learned in a previous\nsection. To be honest, we'll be using\nquite a lot of this anyway. To be\nhonest, we'll be using a little bit of\neach of them anyway. So, you'll see what\nI mean in the code. So, if we go to the\ncode now, the code here is largely the\nsame, except now we're using Pyantic\nagain to be able to create our\nstructured outputs. Remember, if you\ndon't know about Pyantic, it's\ncompletely fine. You don't need to know\nPyante. But there will be a future\ntutorial on data cam on this channel, so\nyou can watch that if you want to. But\ngoing, uh, forwards, we're creating the\nsame agents, but this time with a better\ninstruction, having some slight nudges to\nget what sort of output we want. And\nthis is the output schema we've asked\nfor. So the state output which is a\nschematic using panantic. We're setting\nup the in-memory session service again,\nand we're providing the session ID, and\nnow we create the session once more with\nthe original state. We created the same\nrunner. We've now changed the message\nwhich we want. We're going straight for\n\"Please change my favorite color to red,\nand please change my favorite subject to\ncomputer science.\" This model or this\narchitecture should also be smart enough\nto know that it should not change the\nname or modify it at all. We, uh, run the\nagent and capture the raw outputs, and we\ngrab the updated session, and let's just\nsee what actually came out. So this was\nthe output, and you can see that the this\nis the final state which is read my name\nand computer science. It's done what we\nwanted it to. The favorite color was\nred. The favorite subject was computer\nscience. And the name has been\ncompletely preserved. So this is a way\nyou can use structured outputs to be\nable to change your state. Now there is\none more way to change the state, and\nthis is the proper way, and that's\nsomething called tool context, which\nwe're about to cover in the next\nsection. In the next section also we'll\nbe covering the persistent storage which\nwe've been discussing. So I'll see you\nthere. So this is the final section for\nthis tutorial, and it's quite a big one\nbecause everything will start hopefully\nclicking now. So persistent agents, what\nare they? Well, they are, uh, agents that\nremember our data and progress even\nafter we close and reopen the app. We've\nalready discussed this before, but what\nare we going to be coding in this\nsection? Well, we, I've decided to build\na habit tracking agent. When we start\nthe app, it should be able to check if\nwe already have a session. If we have\nalready got a session, it should be able\nto load that session. Or if we have\nnever created a session before, i.e.\nthis is the first time the user is using\nthe session, then it should be able to\ncreate it automatically for us. It\nshould have three tools. It should be\nable to add habits, view habits, and\ndelete habits. And it should all of\nthese changes should be saved to a local\ndatabase. That way, our data is safe and\npersistent. So that's the goal. And the\nthing which I mentioned briefly in the\nend of last section was tool context. So\ntool context, just, it's a bit of an\nadvanced topic. It's slightly beyond the\nscope of this video. I've chose to\ninclude it because I'm think you can, uh,\nunderstand it. But in the most simplest\nterm possible, it's really just a way\nfor, uh, giving our tools direct access to\nthe current session state. So we can\nread and update the habits\nautomatically. And we do this by using\ntool context. So you'll see that in the\ncode. So TLDDR, think of persistent\nagents as our personal memory keepers.\nThey make sure our progress and\npreferences are always remembered. So\nlet's go build this habit tracking\nagent. Right off the bat, you can see\nthat we've imported the database session\nservice. And this is instead of the\nin-memory session service which we\nimported in the previous section. We now\nload our API keys, and these three\nconstants are created. So this is the\npersistent storage file, aka where the\ndatabase is located. This is the name of\nour app, which is habit tracker, and this\nis the user ID, which is me, and this will\nidentify the user. We'll be modifying\nthe user ID in just a bit as well. Now\nit comes to the tools. Now you don't\nneed to understand the internal\nmechanics of these tools. That's not\nwhat this section is for. The reason\nthis section was created was to help\nclick things about sessions, events,\nrunners, agent, all of that stuff. So\njust briefly looking at the tools you\nwill see that we've got our dock string\nand we've got tool context here. So what\nhappens is that the tool context first\nretrieves the state, aka the habits, and\nat first the habits is obviously\ngoing to be an empty list. It then appends the\nhabit to this list, and then it prints\n\"Yep, added habit,\" and it returns the\naction and that we fact that we've added\nit. If this fails, aka if there's no tool\ncontext provided somehow, I've also\nwritten a short script which is, uh, where\nwe manually update the session, that's\nonly as a fail safe mechanism. If we go\nto the view habit, it's something\nsimilar. Rather than appending the\nhabit, all we need to do is view the\nhabit. And that can be simply done by\njust using get. And again, I've created\na simple fail save mechanism here as\nwell if tool context is not provided.\nAnd lastly, for deleting habits, we're\ngoing to be getting the habits, and we're\ngoing to be popping, aka removing that\nhabit from the state. And again, a fail\nsafe mechanism here, which you don't\nreally need to worry about. Here is\nwhere we've defined our agent. So I've\ngot the name of the agent, the\nunderlying model description, and what\ntools to use. And these are the list of\ntools it it has access to. Perfect. Now\nwe create the session state. So we've\nused the database session service. And\nwe've passed in the parameter of\ndatabase URL as you can see here. And\nthis is the initial state. So the\nusername, which is my name, and the\nhabits is nothing, 'cause we don't have any\nhabits to begin with. Right now, here's\nthe most important part of this code.\nThis if statement here, it checks if\nwe've already got a pre-existing\nsession. If we have a pre-existing\nsession before, aka the user has already\ngot a conversational thread going on\nwith the agent, then it loads that\nsession ID using this. But if it doesn't\nand this is the first time that user is\ntalking with the, uh, agent, then we use\nthis session ID. We create it. Then we\ncreate the runner. And this is just for\ndebugging purposes, which I've put\nhonestly. We can just comment it out. Uh,\nbut if you want, once you, if you do run\nthis code, you can put it to keep track\nof the flow. Then we use this function\nto ask the agent, we, uh, run it for every\nsingle event, and we only print the final\nresponse, 'cause there will be four events\nwhich will happen per request. You'll\nsee what I mean in just a second. And\nthis is the main function where we keep\non continuously call ask the agent by\nthis while loop. That was quite a lot.\nYeah. Let's actually run this now.\nYou will see that there should be a\ndatabase appearing here soon.\nThere it is. Habit database. So let's\nquickly inspect it. So if we go here,\nyou should see that in terms of events,\nthere's no event. But in terms of\nsession, there's already one session\nwhich is created, which is my name. Why?\n'Cause we already manually created the\nsession here, which was over here, 'cause\nwe didn't have a session before. So it\nautomatically created the session for\nus. Now let's actually ask some things\nfor, uh, for the agent to do. So say, \"Hey,\ncan you add the habit of me having to\nrun 5k every day,\" for example,\nand these are the habits, and it says, \"Hey,\nI've added the run 5k every day to your\nhabits.\" So if we go into the database\nand check the sessions and check the\nstate parameter, you will see that under\nmy username we have a new habit, \"run 5k\nevery day.\" But in terms of events now\nthere's four events. But why is there\nfour events for one single request? Well,\nfor starters, this, if we go into the\ncontent p, you can see this was my\nrequest, \"Hey, can you add the habit of me\nrunning 5K every day.\" Then the second\nevent was actually calling the tool. So\nin this case we have you internal model\nhas used add habit. You can see it's the\nmodel because the role is model. And the\nthird event is the tool response, and it\nwas \"add habit run 5K every day,\" showing\nthat it was successful. And then the\nfinal was the event of the agent\nactually outputting back to us, which was,\n\"Hey, I've added this habit to your\nhabits.\" So that's why for every single\nrequest there will be four events which\nwill be happening if we proceed. Let's\nsay if we want to create another habit,\nsay, \"Can you also add the habit of me\nlearning\nSpanish every week?\" And it looks like\nit's also done that as well. If we check\nthe database, you can see\nthat the number of sessions, it's still\none because I'm the only person who's\nused this app so far under this user ID.\nIf I go into events, you will see that\nnow there's eight events because we've\ngot we've sent two requests. And if we\ngo back to the session and look at the\nstate, you will see that there are both\nof our habits now. Perfect. So, this is\nworking. The add habit tool at least is\nworking. Now, let's say I want to delete\nuh, the run 5K everyday habit. So, I want\nto delete the run 5K everyday habit. And\nyou can see we've got this to delete one\n5k every day, which is habit number one,\nsay delete one. Now why did it ask this?\nBecause in the code I had mentioned it\nto give the index as well. So we can say\n\"delete run 5k every day,\" which is habit\none. And this should work now.\nPerfect. It does look like it. No\nproblem. I've deleted habit one. So if\nwe go here, relaunch this database,\nyou will see in terms of the state that\nthat is gone. So we only are left with\nthis. Now if I close this now and clear\neverything. And now I'm going to change\none thing, which is the user ID. So let's\nsay the user ID is Bob, for example. And\nlet's also change the name of this as\nwell. Now if I run this, what do you\nthink will happen? This is the most\nimportant part of this whole tutorial.\nIf you get this, then you've understood.\nSo, let's say I say, \"Hey, can you add\nthe habit of me\ncooking or something every day?\" Not\nmuch of a habit, I know, but it's still\nthere for Oh, there we go. Uh, \"Hey, I've\nHey, Bob, I've added cooking every day\nto your habit list.\" Now, if we go to the\ndatabase\n\n\nAnd look at the sessions.\n\nNow, here's the most crucial point.\nYou can see there's two different sessions which have been created.\nMy personal one and then Bob who's another agent.\nSo under the exact same app name we've now two sessions aka two conversational threads going on.\nIf we look at the events you can see all the different events which were occurring.\nSo if we look at the user ID these are all the events which I did and these are all the events which Bob did.\nAnd that is the end of this tutorial.\nI hope you learned a lot.\nIt was quite intensive especially near to the end.\nBut with a little bit of practice and doing the homework exercises I provided him you should be able to master Google ADK soon.\nTo summarize what we've learned, you can see all of the different agents we created here.\nAnd if you want to build yourself to another level, to a further level, then I highly recommend checking out the course down below on data camp.\nIt will take you to an even more advanced level than we already are at.\nIf you have any comments, feedback, criticism, or any questions in general, then feel free to comment them down in the comment section below.\nAnd I will see you in another tutorial.\nBye for now.\n\n[Music]\n",
