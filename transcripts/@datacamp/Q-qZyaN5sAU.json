  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHey Martin, welcome to the show. I mean, I should say welcome back, really. Obviously, you've been a guest several times before for our annual data and AI trends episodes, but here's your first time hosting. So, how does it feel to be in the hot seat?\nVery privileged, I must say. I feel a little bit like you. It's a more comfortable position than needing to want to be given predictions. It's always like I'm scared for a whole year to see like how they play out.\nAbsolutely. Yeah. So, yeah, maybe we got a chance to review some of the things you were talking about in January as well today.\nYes. Well, maybe I'm not sure how well I'm doing. Yeah.\nAll right, great. So, for our first story today, we're going to be talking about a report from McKinsey's Quantum Blackout. So that's the AI arm of McKinsey. So they got a report called Seizing the Agentic AI Advantage. Very cool title for how do you actually make use of AI agents or agentic AI in business.\nAnd they make a case that there's been a lot of investment in generative AI but not many returns so far. And the big idea is that most of the UK use cases at the moment, it's been very much around what they call horizontal use cases. So these are things that are suitable for a lot of the business or wide swathe of your departments. So these are things like chatbots, co-pilots, and they've scaled very well, but they've only given like a small amount of value to each department. And what McKinsey suggests is that what you'd really want are vertical use cases. This is something that's going to be a large amount of benefit for just one department or just one team or maybe just a few individuals in the organization. So I think they're talking things about like things specifically for HR. So you got like HR tooling for like better hiring, or you got things for like legal for contract review, all this kind of stuff, but those have not been widely adopted. And they're saying lots of organizational challenges like a lack of skills, the technology is maybe not quite ready yet, and just the challenge of process re-engineering, very time-consuming. And then they suggest maybe AI agents are going to solve all these problems because they can automate stuff and it's going to be brilliant. Now, I'm not sure whether this is just magical thinking. It's like it's the cool new toy that McKinsey want to talk about, or whether this is going to be a real thing. So, Martin, do you have an opinion on this? Are AI agents going to save us all and make loads of money for businesses?\nWell, first of all, like I think some businesses are making lots of money out of this device, the AI tools. So, given all the use cases you mentioned, I think there's like an AI startup scale-up, a little bit for everything. And I recently read some data about like it's one of the fastest growing areas of startups in terms of revenue that they bring in. It's also a little bit of a different word, I think world. I think we came out of a world where lots of money was spent on building product and not that much focus on the business side. It seems that people have learned their lessons and actually quite a lot of these AI startups are making a decent amount of money. So the AI cash is going somewhere, like somewhere is sneaky money, but I think what you really mean is like, okay, the ones who are buying all these toys, are they seeing the gains? Um, so I think it's it's a little bit underwhelming at the moment, but I think it's part of just of the hype curve. I think that the benefit will still come. Um, now recently had with some colleagues some discussions around this, and then they're like different takes as well. Um, so, so one of the things that one of my colleagues raised was the solo paradox or the productivity paradox. Like I needed to look it up as well, but basically what it pointed out was that well, there's actually slow, there was like a slowdown in productivity growth in the US between the 70s and the 80s, despite like, okay, like big promises because information technology, computers were coming out, and that was going to like boost productivity like it's never seen before. Um, so despite lots of companies spending a lot of money on computers and technology and expecting much more and better results and people getting faster at doing their jobs, there's like this argument that like, okay, actually it's not what we see if you look at productivity growth. Um, it was a little bit of a long intro to like, okay, well, I think the productivity growth will come from AI and that it will start solving actual problems rather than like toy problems. Um, but at the same time, like having that productivity paradox in mind, like, okay, am I 100% confident? Like, no, not like that. That's also like not the not the case. Um, but I think that it goes slower than people anticipate, I think is a little bit normal, I would say.\nYeah. So it does seem fairly intuitive that you have to invest in stuff first and then you reap all the rewards, you get the money, the increased productivity growth, the extra revenue generation, whatever, like a later on. I guess it's just a question of how patient you want to be about like waiting for that extra cash to come in.\nYes. And like, and and also like not every investment like turns out the way that you hope it to be. So, um, I think there's also still a lot of like uncertainty around like, okay, what are the investments that make sense? What are the investments that don't make sense? Like AI seems to have product market fit in the marketing field. It seems to have product market fit in the software engineering field. If you think about Cursor and like Whisp, sorry, Cursor, um, and how it's making like engineers more productive. I'm more active on the marketing sales side, and we see like, okay, how much more I can do. Um, so there's like true product market fit and maybe a little bit on the legal side. Um, but then, okay, on the finance side, you see, at least I haven't seen that much yet. So I think we're also trying to figure out like, okay, where where does the most value sit? Where does the lowest angle of value sit? Um, and in that process, well, investments get lost while you try to figure that out.\nAbsolutely. Yeah. I mean, I think that's fairly natural. Like, uh, not every investment is going to be a winner, but you need to figure out like what's what the sort of the good bets are going to be. Um, now, there's one more thing I want to talk about in this report. So, uh, it's perhaps the most controversial bit. Um, so, uh, the report is suggesting that the best use cases for agents are going to be just automating business processes. This is a great way of saving money. Is you take your existing business processes and then you use a bit of software, a bit of AI to just automate away the bits so humans don't have to do them. Now, uh, a lot of this is really the AI is not that new or not that involved in it. It's just taking the sort of standard approach. It's been around for sort of at least the last decade of just using software to automate business processes and then maybe there's an LM, an LLM in there somewhere. But, uh, so there was some pushback from this. Uh, so, uh, it was Ethan Mollick, so it was a renowned AI professor. Uh, he was saying that well, this is really missing a trick because a lot of the latest models that come out this year, they're really good at reasoning. You can do things that are a lot more complex than just, you know, summarizing bits of text or whatever. So, there's a kind of there's a disagreement about what the best use of AI agents are. Do you want really simple agents or do you want something fancier that's more akin to like a junior employee? I don't know whether you have an opinion on this.\nSo, in the in the in the short term, I agree with the McKinsey report. In the long term, I agree with the Ethan Mollick rebuttal, but for a different reason. Uh, so, um, so I think where McKinsey is right in its report is in the fact that if you do this type of change in a company, and I can only imagine like the larger the company, the more difficult it is, like there's a certain like inertia. And because of that, like, okay, you can come in and you can say like, hey, we're going to tackle like the biggest, most complex process or product that we have, and we're going to make it full AI. And probably along the way, like you lose everyone and your whole investment you're trying to do falls flat. Um, so from that perspective, like starting simple, which is like my distillation of like, okay, what they're saying, it got it makes sense like in a pro in a in a world where you move more and more towards embedding AI in your organization. Um, so, so that's what I mean with a different reason. So, so my argument is, okay, why I agree with McKinsey paper is more from like, okay, organizational change perspective, rather than the arguments that they make. Because I think in the arguments, arguments that they make and the way that Ethan Mollick tries to debunk them, like I'm actually on the side of of of Ethan Mollick where, okay, he points out like the reference models that are in the McKinsey report, they're outdated.\nThey make certain arguments around costs, but like what we've been seeing the last three years is that like cost has been declining rapidly. They're like hyper-focused. McKinsey is hyper-focused on efficiency, but like they're then focused on efficiency from like yesterday's technology. And like when I wrapped that, I was thinking about like, there's this, there's this famous quote by like Peter Drucker. Like he's a, his management consultancy, I think maybe even like one of the founding members of management consultancy, like if there's a founding member team, but it's like, okay, there's nothing so useless as doing things efficiently that should not be done at all. And like that part like reminded me a little bit about it. Like, why are we caring about efficiency of like the models that are already like obsolete? It's like it's irrelevant. So I think short-term, the way that McKinsey is positioning it and approaching it, I think it makes sense, but not necessarily for the reasons that they say it makes sense. And and there are more demol like does that resonate with you or do you feel like no, totally off mark?\nIt does. No. Um, so I like the Peter Drucker quote. And actually, I was speaking to one of our customers the other week, and so this is someone at a bank, and they were saying they were really excited. Like we've just been building all these agents to automate our fax workflows. And I'm like, I'm kind of conflicted about this. Cuz he's like, why are we still using faxes? Like it's not been a sensible technology at any point in the century. And so it's obviously completely crazy. Like it's just a technology fix over a really stupid process. But obviously, this is a smart person. If they had any power to not use faxes, they would have done that decades ago. Um, so maybe going back to my productivity paradox, like that's a little bit of the, a little bit the point. Like they just, they skipped out on the internet and it still worked out fine for them because I assume they're still a big bank. Like a bank is hard to run. So like they have something figured out. Uh, so yeah, it goes back to that that productivity paradox and like, okay, like what, what increases will we actually see, if any?\nYeah, absolutely. So, yeah, like after this, they're going to call me an AI doomer, which I'm not. For the sake of the argument, take the opposite side here.\nUh, yeah. Uh, what is all this stupid AI? Why, why are we bothering by getting any productivity out of it? Um, no, so I, I think that this argument, it comes back to strategists versus operationalists. So if you are doing something where it's research, you're not quite sure what the answer's going to be, that's where you need like strong reasoning, you need like very flexible processes, and that's where these higher reasoning models come in and where you really want the fancy agents to help you out. If you are focused on operations, you want really like more rigid processes that are streamlined and do the same thing over and over again at scale. And that's where you care about just having simple automated processes that are repeatable. So yeah, I think it just depends exactly like what you're doing. All right, so let's move on to the next story. Uh, so, uh, before Martin, you mentioned about like the people making money out of this seem to be like the AI startups and scale-ups. And there's been some big purchase going on in this area. Do you want to tell us about them?\nYeah, sure. So, uh, one of the, one of the things that obviously was like big news in the last week was Meta/Facebook, for those who are still with the old name, or like Mark Zuckerberg, buying like Scale AI. Well, sorry, he didn't buy Scale AI. He took his stake of, I believe, 49% in Scale AI, and he, I guess he paid 15 billion dollars for that, which is by any measure a lot of money. Um, uh, like, okay, for the listeners who don't really know what Scale AI does, so, um, basically they solve the data labeling problem. So, um, in short, if you want to have like really powerful AI, you're going to need like enormous amounts of like high-quality labeled data. And creating high-quality labeled data is something that's incredibly slow. It's very expensive. And what Scale AI did is basically build a factory that produces this type of like high-quality labeled data. So if you're like Tesla, you send like thousands of dollars of video feed to Scale AI. They go over it frame by frame and they say like, hey, this is a pedestrian and this is a tree and this is like a traffic light and so on and so on. Like if you're like OpenAI, you have, you are in need of like real people writing high-quality questions and answers. Uh, you have a need for people that need to rate AI's responses, responses telling like, okay, is this a good answer? Is this a bad answer? And like all of that is basically done by Scale AI, which makes them enormously valuable because again, like you need this type of like high-quality labeled data.\nUm, and then the question is like, okay, why, why is Meta's, has Mark Zuckerberg doing this? Uh, lots of theories out there. Uh, one is, well, okay, he feels that the Llama models are behind, and if you look at the benchmarks, like that seems to be the case, and he feels the need to like do a catch-up.\n\nUm, and this type of like move allows him to do that because, uh, on the one hand, well, he kind of becomes exclusive owner of this high-quality labeled data. Um, uh, both Google and I believe OpenAI, who were former customers of Scale AI, already said, like, okay, like, we're canceling our contract. Um, so, okay, he now owns this probably very valuable dataset, uh, and process himself. Probably has now a little bit of insight into how Google and OpenAI were training their models. Um, uh, so like that's beneficial. Um, secondly, like, okay, um, there's, uh, the CEO of Scale AI is apparently like a very talented guy. Uh, the what he's built seems to be a good validation that he's a he's a pretty, pretty, pretty smart cookie. Um, and he's going to lead up, um, Meta's new super intelligence division. So, the super intelligent division of Meta is basically, okay, Mark saying like, okay, we are falling behind. Mind, we need a new initiative. The next frontier is super intelligence. So, I'm going to put this super talented guy at the top of it. I'm paying $15 billion for being able to do that. And so, now I have that. So, okay, that's another theory, like he needed talent and it's some very expensive acquire. Uh, the, uh, first theory was like, okay, yes, he needs high-quality data. He has that now. Um, another theory is like, well, maybe it's a competitive move, like somebody described it as like, okay, he takes a chess piece off the board, but now that OpenAI and Google don't no longer have access to it, like, okay, is that going to hurt their own, uh, model training? Um, and then the final one that, uh, and I'll give it to you, Richie, for some comments. The final one I found interesting was, well, uh, somebody just said, well, it's actually like in Facebook terms, like it's not a lot of money. Uh, it's like, like 1% of their like market value or something like that. So, like, it's a, it's a blip, uh, for them. So, uh, from a risk perspective, it's a, it's a fairly low risk bet to get back into the game. Um, so, yeah, like lots of interesting things happening there, like lots of gossip, intrigues, like, okay, who's going to win this? Will this put them, uh, back into the game? Um, but like definitely like a newsworthy story, um, in, uh, in, in AI world.\n\nUh, yeah. Uh, so it's a good bit of sort of corporate gossip, actually. Um, like the idea of just investing $15 billion in it being not very much, very, uh, very foreign to me, but, uh, yeah, it's, uh, it's amazing the amount of money involved in the, uh, the AI game at the moment, actually. So, I recently watched the movie Mountain View. It's kind of like the Succession TV show, but set in, uh, Silicon Valley. So, I learned a phrase about, so to invest a billion dollars, they used the phrase to bust a bean-nut, which is, it sounds kind of rude, but the idea of, yeah, Mark Zuckerberg busting 15 peanuts on on Scale. It's very interesting. Uh, all right. Anyway, so, uh, yeah, you mentioned Scale. We actually had, uh, guests from Scale's competitor, SAM AI. So, it was Wendy Gonzalez, the CEO, and Duncan Curtis, one of the senior vice presidents talking about this. It's absolutely fascinating the idea that, uh, yeah, data is still perhaps the most important thing in order to get great quality, uh, AI. So, uh, we talk about AI being the big thing. Mustn't forget about the data because that's what's powering everything. And just, uh, like in terms of trying to get better quality AI, I mean, you basically got a choice of four things. You've got, um, better data that we mentioned, or you can invent new models, but that's slow and it takes time because you've got to do research. And then you can either add more, uh, compute power during training, but like the latest foundation models, they're costing like upwards of $10 million or like a hundred million to create. So, we're kind of reaching the limits of like how much you can spend to create new models. And then you can also add like inferential compute, but that makes your models more expensive to run and, uh, it makes them slower as well. So then, yeah, that's a terrible user experience. So, like better data really is like the, the big solution for getting better AI at the moment. Yeah, better data and, and, um, just a hypothesis, but like probably the, the, the talent that you have within the company is, uh, like plays a big role as well, and it always plays a big role, like, like high-quality people, uh, always make a difference. There was like this other, um, interview with Sam Altman, uh, where he basically said, like, okay, Facebook has been trying to coach, um, some of our most talented people, and they're offering them a $100 million signing bonus. Um, which is, when you hear the story, it's like, well, that sounds pretty crazy, but then, well, one of the narratives in this whole acquisition story we just went over is, well, he wanted to have a really good head of his super intelligence division. He identified Alexander Wang, the founder of Scale AI, as being that person, and he wrote a check of $15 billion to own not even half of the company. Um, so, like, it's the data, but then apparently like, okay, the, the, the people, and probably the, the novelty of the ideas that they come up with, like plays, seems to be playing a big role as well. Uh, and maybe Mark is identifying one of the issues, like I'd say Mark, I'm definitely not on the first name basis with him. Uh, uh, it's, uh, uh, maybe another thing is, maybe one of the key things he sees is why Llama is behind is because he does not have a talented enough team at the moment, and probably already has a very talented team. Maybe the difference is, is, is, uh, is hard to grasp for us worlds, uh, on this topic.\n\nYeah. Uh, maybe. I mean, of course, cuz like, uh, back in the day, Mark Zuckerberg, he became like the youngest ever like self-made billionaire. I think he was like 23, and then it was Alexander Wang from Scale AI who broke that record. He became a billionaire when he was 21. So maybe that's, uh, that's part of the reason he, he, he wanted to hire him. Uh, a little bit of envy.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Something like that. Uh, all right. So I think you had another story around, uh, hiring or or around buying things.\n\nYeah. So, so another rumor that's going around is that, uh, Apple is, is, is considering or well, it's a rumor that they would like to purchase Perplexity, and like the number that's been circulating is $20 billion. Um, I'm not sure like, okay, to what degree that's true. Um, uh, but, um, I think it speaks to the story of the fact that, well, Apple seems to be in a bit of a tough spot, uh, with its AI plans. Uh, so, um, I haven't met a lot of people that are happy with Apple Intelligence, um, or the way that, uh, Siri is using, uh, AI. I think they made quite a lot of promises, uh, none of them fulfilled. Uh, I think it's for the first, uh, first time in 10 years, like, so I'm on on a Google device. I use Android. So, for 10 years, I needed to listen about like, okay, why having an iPhone is so much better, and why am I not switching to an iPhone, and so on, and so on. And like, now I actually have the better functionality. They're all locked into their little Apple ecosystem. Uh, so maybe I eventually will have the last laugh. Um, but so, yeah, but the point being like, okay, so Apple seems to be in a little bit of a at the moment in the losing spot on everything that has to do with AI, and, uh, I think rumors like this are, I like, I don't know where where the origin is, is like, okay, the question is like, okay, are they trying to fix it or not? And trying, do they try to fix it internally? But then internally, they have like lots of people switching job positions, switching roles, switching functions, and so on. So, doesn't really like, uh, look like a like a stable environment. Like that said, like if you look back at OpenAI in the last 18 months, you could probably make the same argument there, and they kept shipping, uh, models. Um, but like from the outside, like it looks all a little bit weird, and like, are they going to need to buy it in? And then, uh, some like Perplexity, um, came around. Um,\n\nNow, yeah, I think I use Perplexity once in a while. Um, but, uh, it's obviously also not the biggest model out there. And Apple has a lot of cash, and they have a lot of stock value. So, you could even see them making like a even bigger acquisition if they really want to. But it seems like consensus is like, hey, they're going to need to do something, uh, because everyone isn't happy with that part of their product. So, are they going to buy it in or are they going to develop it, uh, themselves? Well, maybe a final thing on this is, um, there's like another angle to look at it, and is that Google is paying them really a lot of money to have Google be the default search engine, uh, on their iPhone. Um, I believe it's also like in these magnitude of $20 billion, uh, dollars a year. Um, if you start to integrate AI more and more, uh, and you make that a central piece, well, you're losing $20 million in. It's probably basically pure profit. Yeah, lots of lots of hard and difficult problems. Uh, I think they're definitely like in the corner, um, where, uh, yeah, they're getting, um, yeah, hit from all different sides. Uh, so it's going to be interesting to see like how they get out of this, and, and if it will be with a with a big acquisition. There's actually, and then I'll stop and let you react with you. There's actually like this, I think the biggest, uh, acquisition Apple ever made was like Beats, like, you know, like the Dr. Dre headphones, um, which is like from a totally different magnitude. I believe it's like a billion something than what's being rumored today. Um, so, yeah, that's like a little bit like, so Apple for Perplexity, Richie, what do you think? Will they, will they buy or will they build or,\n\nYeah, I mean, will they burn and go away?\n\nUh, yeah, I think, uh, Apple disappearing completely, that that's, uh, more of an outside chance, but certainly they really need to do something. Uh, and it's interesting, is it like Beats is the biggest thing Apple's ever bought? Like, uh, that's crazy, cuz that's a tiny company compared to Apple, uh, when you compare it to something like, uh, Salesforce, where, you know, they they bought Slack, they bought, uh, Tableau, and it's like constantly acquiring things and then trying to, uh, fit them into the business. So, yeah, uh, if Apple does buy something that big, as big as Perplexity, or even bigger, then, yeah, it doesn't have the the reflexes to kind of fold new businesses, uh, into itself. So that's going to be a very interesting integration challenge.\n\nYeah. And I think to to the to the to the point of Scale AI and and and the point of talent, like maybe that's what Apple needs, like, okay, they need some true AI talent inside of Apple, and okay, what is it that they can buy to bring that talent in? Scale AI is off the market now, like what else is out there, um, to, uh, to bring that in. I think, uh, Microsoft at some point bought one of the, uh, one of the companies there could bring in some, uh, some AI talent. So, yeah, let's let's see what they do.\n\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, oh, so on that note, there was the Google bought, uh, Character.AI, uh, for it's a few billion dollars, uh, and that was basically just to hire back one of the executives that had left the company previously.\n\nMaybe that was was one of the, yeah. Yeah, that's true. This Character.AI was founded by one of the people who wrote the original \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper, if I'm remembering correctly.\n\nYeah. All these like hirings for hundred millions of dollars. I'm I'm in the wrong game.\n\nWell, you should write a paper.\n\nUm, all right, cool. Let's move on to the next story. Um, I've got another report for you. Uh, this is the EU Generative AI Outlook Report. So, it's a report to sort of inspire policymakers in the EU just on like what should they do around generative AI. So, uh, the big theme is that, uh, generative AI ought to be considered a strategic asset, uh, for European countries just in order to, uh, generate economic growth and, uh, increase employment, increase productivity, things like that. So, uh, there's a big worry, uh, in the, uh, report that the EU is lagging behind in compute capacity. So, we're seeing the total compute capacity, uh, of all these sort of GPU clusters, high-performance computing clusters across Europe is less than the size of XAI's Colossus compute, uh, uh, cluster. So, uh, the, uh, Colossus has got, uh, I think, uh, it's like 200,000, uh, Nvidia GPUs in it. So, it's a pretty amazing technological feat. This is, uh, based in Memphis. Uh, but yeah, that's more than the whole EU combined. So, uh, the EU is lagging in, uh, AI infrastructure. Uh, but then, uh, beyond that, um, there is, uh, the focus of the report is that, um, generative AI should, uh, be focused around small and medium enterprises. The focus is on small to medium enterprises because this constitutes 99% of all businesses within the EU. Uh, presumably that's, I'm not sure whether it's by headcount or like total number of businesses, certainly not by, uh, by revenue, but, um, yeah, uh, think every business basically should have, uh, some sort of, uh, generative AI angle, uh, regardless of its size. Uh, so, um, there were there were several, uh, sort of perceived challenges there. So, one was the infrastructure thing I mentioned, one was just going about, uh, process re-engineering, the third one was the AI skills gaps. To spend a lot of time talking about, well, how do you make sure that people have the the right skills? And so, um, the two things that everyone needs to have, uh, so basic AI literacy skills, it's first of all, just how do you go about using some of these, uh, AI tools, but also do you understand what the implications of using AI? So, basically, what is possible with AI, what is not possible with AI, what should you do with it, like what are some sensible use cases? And the other thing, uh, on this is that, uh, digital skills, including AI skills, and now recognizes basic skills. So, this is like a legal term, which puts them alongside reading, mathematics, and science. So, these are things that basically everyone, they think everyone should be taught from school age onwards. These are big implications just for, uh, childhood educational curriculums, uh, right through to adult learning.\n\nUm, all right. So, uh, first of all, uh, Martijn, do you, uh, this all sounds like a a sensible thing, making, uh, AI skills, uh, putting them on the same level as like reading, uh, maths and and science?\n\nYeah. Well, let me first say because you you you uh uh you you you definitely triggered me with your opening sentence around like, uh, inspiring policymakers to write policies or something along those lines. Like I don't, I don't, I first of all, I don't think that, uh, we should inspire policymakers, uh,\n\nTo write AI rules, uh, for those who watched our talk at the start of the year, around our predictions and the EU AI Act, know that I'm not a super big fan of all of this. So, this whole push towards like regulation writing policies around this feels very European. It feels very like, okay, we're good at writing rules and making policies and doing laws. It reminds me a little bit of that saying, if you want to get started, you need to quit talking and begin doing. I think there's lots of talking, lots of writing, very little doing. Am I a fan of all this? We're going to let policymakers write good policies about AI? Not really. Do I agree with what's been said on, like, okay, yes, AI probably, like AI skills is probably going to be a basic skill, like reading and math and science? Yes. But does that, like, I think that can, like, if you let the citizens of the EU go out themselves, I think they'll figure this out themselves and find their own path and go at their own pace, and they'll be supported from the private markets or pushed from the private markets to their jobs to do this. Maybe a very quick data point on that, I would bet that for the past three years, if you would aggregate the data, the biggest users of ChatGPT were students. So, if you think about students, students are already adopting this skill, they don't need a policy for that. They're already ahead of the people that write the policy, I would guess. So, this need for writing all the rules about it, no, I think the market is fixing it themselves. Our children are taking the necessary steps to do this. So, is it a common sense recommendation? Yes. Does it need to have everything around it? I don't think so. I think you let people do what they seem best, and it seems that if you let them do that, then with students as an example, that's already happening.\n\nOkay. Yeah, I want to argue with this. So, yeah, I agree that the market is going to solve many problems in a commercial sense, but I also do think it's important for policymakers to have that sort of AI literacy themselves. So, having an understanding of what the point of germ AI is, in order that if they do write policies, they're not going to do something stupid. I also think that in non-commercial cases, it's also very useful to have some policy there. So, for example, if you're designing a school curriculum, you want to know what good guidance is.\n\nWell, the best way to avoid doing something stupid is not doing it. So, or not doing anything. Like, yes, should schools think about how to incorporate AI in their curriculum and make it part of their basic skill? 100%. But I think that's, I think my example of the private market was not that well chosen because I think I equally think that if you have a motivated educator or teacher, they will bring this as well. I'm actually fairly sure that in many classrooms today, within Europe, without any policies, they're handling, they're playing with AI in a very creative way and thinking about how can we use this. Yeah, maybe I'm a bit too much Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation on this topic.\n\nYeah, I don't like rules.\n\nYeah, I think it's just different levels of comfort with the bureaucratic engine.\n\nOkay. All right. So, yeah, there's different ways of making it work. All right. Let's move on to the next story. You had something about an AI effort.\n\nYeah. So, uh, so I don't really follow basketball, but the NBA finals took place, and there was actually an ad that was fully created by AI. And so that was not the first one because Coca-Cola did it in the past, and again, we referenced that in our start of the year podcast episode. But the crazy thing about this ad, it was by the way, an ad of Gali, which is, as far as I understand, a predictive batting kind of company. But the crazy thing about this ad was that the creator, and it was a single creative, Mike wrote a blog post describing his workflow, and that's what's crazy because again, this is an ad that goes in prime time during the NBA finals, and he basically built it with Google Gemini, I think V3. He used like a little script, 10 lines, and then edited the clips in some standard video editing software. And it was done. So, it took him two days to generate 30 seconds of content. And if you look at the cost estimate, if you would exclude his time, it was $600 to generate the content. So, I'm probably sure our listeners have heard about the crazy amounts that are paid for advertising during these top spots at the Super Bowl, at the NBA finals, and you look at these ads, and they just look expensive. If you look at this ad, it actually looks really good. And if you then realize, hey, this is created in two days by a single person with a technology that's maybe two, two and a half years old, mainstream, that's actually pretty amazing. So, yeah, you didn't need to pay a writer, you didn't need any camera persons, no actors needed. So, yeah, pretty fascinating. Rachel, I don't know. Have you seen the ad?\n\nI have seen the ad, and yeah, I didn't get all the cultural references because again, I'm not a basketball fan. So, it was very odd. I liked the ad though. It was fun. There were some interesting things that I think were caused by technological limitations. So, for example, there's lots of very short sections with quick camera cuts. So, it's doing one or two seconds, and this is just because AI can't retain consistency for very long. It's also quirky, and I think that's the only thing you can really get away with at the moment because perfect realism of movements and things like that is not really possible. So, having stuff that is weird and fast cutting is kind of the only tone you can go for at the moment.\n\nThat's a nice explanation. Like, I was actually, my take was, oh, I'm getting old because this is way too flashy and switches way too quickly. But I like your take more. Which is, yeah, it probably makes sense what you're saying. Like, you clearly see that they need to switch between different scenes very quickly. And it's most likely now, I was deliberately paying attention to it during the first time that I saw the ad, and I couldn't spot any obvious glitches. Like, I couldn't see six fingers or somebody with three legs or something like that. So, at least for me, maybe if I look at it a fifth or a sixth time, I start looking at the glitch, but I don't think that many people look at an ad six times in a row. So, I did that. It's like, okay, in the first run, I didn't see that much wrong with it besides, okay, it was very snappy.\n\nYeah, I was just, that's the other thing is like, if you keep things moving quickly, then it distracts people from the fact that maybe the lighting or the shadows isn't quite right in the background, or there's an inconsistency with where some background objects are placed. So, yeah, keeping things moving quickly seems to be the secret for things, but I agree that a lot of the artifacts are disappearing pretty quickly. It is getting much more realistic very fast. Yeah, I'm intrigued to see what happens, how this affects creative industries though, because you mentioned here it was done by one person, so you don't need a cameraman, you don't need actors, you don't need scriptwriters. We had two Hollywood strikes last year, the screen actor strike and then the actors guild striking, exactly because of this. And now, okay, everything that these people striking predicted are sort of coming to pass. Real content going out of prime time is being done by AI with no other people needed beyond one person in a prompt. So, how do you think this plays out in the real world?\n\nI think in phases, and I think the phases are going to follow the length of the content. So, going back to the clips point, okay, it's delivered like little clips basically together because creating a 30-second or a minute ad that's all in the same scene is probably too hard or too glitch prone. So, I think what we'll see is, okay, so now we saw a little ad. Maybe the next thing we see is a more consistent ad. Then we're going to see a 10-minute standup show by an AI. And then we might see a 20-minute sitcom existing out of five episodes. And then the next thing is maybe a 70-minute children's movie, and then we're at the two-hour thriller. So, I think getting from that 15-second clip to the 1 hour and 30 minutes movie, I think that's actually still a long way to go in art. And I don't think it's because of the creative part. I think people figure out how to write the prompts, how to work with the camera perspectives. I think it's really going to be about the technology. Without having any insight on this, we've seen massive improvement, but from a blind perspective, it's not that we are still watching 15 seconds, but the 15 seconds look a lot better, but they're not a minute or two minutes long.\n\nYeah. So, I've seen a few sort of videos. So, the Door Brothers do quite funny, satirical videos, and they're kind of a couple of minutes long, and that's amazing, but that's the most I want to concentrate on AI-generated content at the moment. And part of me wonders, at the moment, it's very novel, but is that kind of quirky tone and all the fast cuts, is that going to get tedious quickly, do you think, or are we going to get past that and have content that you can concentrate on for a bit longer?\n\nWell, I think we're going to need to get past that because I think this is a particular type of content and style that's not going to be well-suited for everyone. So, if you want to make this, like, really, imagine your Netflix is full of videos like this, ads, like, I wouldn't have a Netflix subscription. It's too much, too fast, too loud. My guess is they will need to fix this setting. I'm trying to think what are good examples. Maybe well, if you look at when Toy Story first came out versus where we are today in 3D and computer-generated movies, it's also a very big difference, and that happened what is it, in the last 20 years or something like that, 20, 25 years. And so, we'll, my guess is we'll get there, but I do think there's still quite some hurdles to do. This is, and there's a story by Seinfeld who was talking about how do you become a good stand-up comedian, and it's like, okay, doing a five-minute bit, that's how you start. Doing 20 minutes is already difficult. Doing an hour is extremely difficult, and an hour and 20 minutes, that's insane. And it's like, that's how you separate the average stand-up from the top stand-up. I think it's going to, when I talk about the time frames, that's a little bit the metaphor I have in my mind. Yes, you can create a 30-second clip, it's hard but doable, and it's getting more and more accessible, but now we're going to the 10 minutes and 20 minutes, and when will we be at that 1 hour 20, and what will it take?\n\nAbsolutely. So, maybe all these screenwriters, the skilled actors guild, they've got a bit more time to figure things out before it starts going into mainstream TV stuff.\n\nYeah, on the screenwriting, I think there's still a pretty good, somebody needs to write a prompt, so they're probably good, I would guess.\n\nUh, yeah, true. No. Okay. So, actually, before we move on, do you have a sense of how much this cost? Like, how much?\n\nI have no idea, actually, to be honest. Well, we got the benchmark, like I said, it's $600 to generate that video, excluding the cost of the person, but on the, I don't have any idea on the token cost like specifically. Allegedly, this one cost $600.\n\nAll right, $600 of clips. So, this is like, for an individual, it's something you've got to think about a bit, but for a business, that's just nothing.\n\nYeah, indeed.\n\nOkay. All right. Cool. So, last story, quick one because we've been talking for a while. So, I want to talk about the first benchmark for deep research tools. So, these deep research.\n\nTools are, um, around, uh, you can ask more complicated questions of, uh, generative AI. They'll go away and think for 10 minutes and then come back with a report for you. This is, uh, this comes out of research from the University of Science and Technology of China. Uh, and uh, they tested so tools from OpenAI, tools from Anthropic, uh, Google, uh, XAI, and Perplexity. And so, uh, we have a few winners. Uh, they they split into two categories actually. So, uh, the deep research agents are things that are specifically advertised at being, uh, able to use tools and are for, uh, deep research. So, uh, the the wins in this category is Gemini 2.5 Pro, uh, the deep research version of that. Uh, and then second place was the OpenAI deep research tool. So, uh, those those are the best ones if you want to try out different deep deep research tools. The second category, it was just standard issue, uh, LLM with, uh, search, uh, tool capabilities. So in this case, uh, the winner was, uh, Claude 3.7 set, and second place was Perplexity Sonar Reasoning. So most of them had a winner. XAI was the only one which, uh, which didn't have a winner in in either category. But it seems like in general, uh, the tools that are specifically marketed as deep research tools do better at deep research, which is a good thing. Um, yeah, uh, the AI are doing something rather than just a bit of branding on the benchmark. The interesting thing was that, uh, they took a load of like real-world prompts. Uh, and then the they had an LLM to judge whether or not these, uh, these agents were were working correctly. And to begin with, the agents were being too too nice, and they were giving everything a high score, which is stupid because you want to be discriminatory about like what what's good and what's bad. So in the end, they had to get humans who were experts to write reports, and then they got the LLMs to compare it to the human report. So there's, uh, some human, uh, benchmarking involved in this. Uh, LLMs can't be trusted sort of by themselves at the moment. It also says that whatever the tool is, they're all still really bad at generating citations, uh, uh, or at least accurate citations where the content of whatever they're linking to actually says what they they claim it does. So I think it's a known problem, something to watch out for you make use of these tools. Now, uh, Martin, I don't know, have you have you used any of the deep research tools? Have you found they work or not? So, I use them a little bit. Like, it's definitely like in the in in my AI workflow. It's, um, probably the one that I use the least. Uh, I I I'm not often having that that type of use case. Um, but, um, let me give you an example. When I when I did use it, like, okay, I I use this, I needed to get some information out of like, uh, quarterly earnings reports, uh, from organizations, and actually did a pretty good job there. And what I noticed was like compared to when I used it in other instances, is that, uh, because I had like bad experiences with it also, and it was because the prompt that I provided was not specific enough. Um, more anecdotal, it's my own experiences. Like, okay, so what I've learned was that if I give it like, research me on this earnings report for this particular company, and I want to have this type of information, and look back in the last like 24 months, like it gave me actually really good insights. When I would say, give me everything of the S&P 500 and all the earnings and blah blah blah, like again, when it's too broad, like it, I got like some funky behavior. Maybe it's not writing the right prompt, um, maybe it's something on the tool, but it's a little bit off-putting when you when you go through that experience. So, I actually haven't talked to anyone, um, and this is all this is on this is on me. Like, it would actually be good to talk to a couple people who use deep research tools like on a daily basis and understand how are they using it? What are they what are they doing? Um, because I have a good feel of like, okay, I I use ChatGPT, I use Gemini models on a daily basis, but I don't use deep research. Like, okay, who is the equivalent of me who uses deep research the entire time, um, and and yes, what what they think, what they do. So, yeah. Yeah, all right. We have to get Adele back then. I think he's a big fan of the deep research tools. I I I agree that, um, I find the workflow incredibly frustrating because I'm, um, the models run for a few minutes. So, you have to get the prompt right up front. And you're right that if you are more specific about what you want, it dramatically increases the chance of you getting things right. But that means that you've then got to do a lot of work up front in thinking, well, what do I actually want? And like, which sites should this, uh, thing, uh, be looking at in order to pull the information from? What do I actually want out of it? And you have to do so much prep up front to get it right that you you've done half the research yourself. So, uh, yeah, uh, in order to get good results, you've really got to be good at that kind of prompt engineering, and you've got to just take the time to think about what you want the answer to to be. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Uh, yeah. So, uh, it's, uh, the technologies kind of coming together again. It's like it's the process stuff that it's a little bit frustrating to to use at the moment. But, uh, yeah, if, uh, any of your any of your listeners have been making use of these deep research tools and you found success or you found some challenges, then, uh, please do, uh, hit us up on social media. Let us know what, uh, what you found. All right, wonderful. Uh, well, it's been a pleasure chatting with you, Martin. Uh, we have talked for way too long, so, uh, let us wrap up here. Uh, have you enjoyed the experience of, uh, hosting DataFramed? Uh, this was nice. Like, it's amazing that you got paid for this. I would do this for free. Okay. Certainly not taking a salary cut to free. Okay, guys. No, it was really, really fun. Uh, and thanks for having me, Richie. All right. Cheers.",
