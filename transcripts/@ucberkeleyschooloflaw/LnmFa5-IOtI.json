  "cleanText": "Well, welcome everyone.\nMy name is Yury Kapgan. I'm the president of the board of directors for the Berkeley Law Alumni Association, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, and Berkeley Law class of 2001. I'm here to introduce our program today. But before I do that, I want to invite you all to help support the growth of programming for our alumni community. We've established great regional chapters in our largest alumni regions of the country, and we want to deputize all of you to really step up with your own ideas about events you'd like to see or host in your community or how you'd otherwise like to bring your community together, no matter where you are. David Smith is the driving force at the Berkeley Alumni Relations Office for this. And as he would be the first to say, it still takes a village.\nDavid can be reached at davidithberkeley.edu.\nAgain, David Smithberkeley.edu.\nAnd he hopes to hear from you about how you might be able to help and participate in these regional alumni chapters.\nSo to our program today entitled Finding True Career Fulfillment. Your host is Celina Lee, class of 2006, and she's the founder of Live Your Dream Club and host of its podcast. Celina started her career as an investment banker at Meil Lynch and worked as a corporate lawyer at a law firm, Ropes and Gray, in New York City, where she currently resides. Celina received her undergraduate degree from MIT and she's a certified professional coach and is a graduate of the Institute for Professional Excellence in Coaching. We're very lucky to have her with us today. We're going to save time at the end for Q&A. So, if you have any questions during the course of the talk, of course, please place them in the chat and we'll try to get to them at the end.\nSo, with that, everyone, Celina Lee.\nHi everyone. Thank you so much for being here. I am so excited that you're here and spending your evenings with me.\nBefore I forget, let me just share my screen.\nOkay. I hope you're able to see my screen. Okay. Unless I hear otherwise.\nOkay. I'm going to just try to open chat and see.\nOkay. Got it. All right. Um, well, welcome everyone. Thank you so much for being here. I'm so excited to tell you about how to find your true career fulfillment. Uh, my name is Celina. I'm the founder of Live Your Dream Club and I've had a lot of challenges in my career as well. So, um, uh, before we get started, I want to tell you a little bit about my background and why I'm here today and then how you can really find your own fulfilling career path. Um, I started my career as an investment banker and then I went to law school, Berkeley Law, and then after that I, uh, moved to New York City to work as a, uh, private equity lawyer, as a corporate lawyer, um, at a big law firm, uh, here in New York City. And I think I learned the hard way the importance of doing work that's really meaningful to me. So, I went through this kind of a long transition of really figuring out what it is that I really wanted to do. And after trying many many different things, I eventually found my way into the world of coaching, which I really believe is my calling. Um, I went to coaching school in 2016. Uh, which was a long time ago already. Oh my gosh. And it's funny because, um, when I graduated from Berkeley Law school, I thought I was done with school forever. The day that I walked out of the bar exam, I was like, I am done with exams. And little did I know, life had different plans. And many years later, I found myself back in school to be uh become a certified coach. And it really honestly has been such a a meaningful journey for me. Um I've supported a lot of people through career transitions and helped them to achieve their goals and dreams. And I kind of feel like I became the person that I really needed when I was really going through uh a really what I it feels like a really um dark tunnel that I thought was never going to end. Um, you know how when you I don't know if you resonate with with my story, but when I was growing up, I think I got this message that as long as work really hard to go to this best school that I can and get the best job, somehow I would be uh guaranteed a lifetime of success and happiness. So, I put my head down and worked really hard and, you know, got into all these schools and got jobs. And I think it's when I was working as a uh corporate lawyer um at a big law firm that I started to really think about my next step. And my obviously next step was, you know, continuing to move up the ladder at the law firm. Really wasn't exciting to me. For me, it wasn't that meaningful because as a private equity lawyer, my job was to review contracts to help rich people become even richer. And that did not find I did not find it to be very meaningful. And I was looking at my boss and, you know, who's been doing the same thing for 20, 30 years. And I was like, my gosh, if I'm in my 60s and this is all I did with my time, I feel like, you know, I would I would be kind of sad about how I spend my time. And that's when my journey started in terms of like, okay, well, what do I really want to do with my life? And it was really ironic because I started to ask myself that question after I was done getting all the degrees and jobs. I feel like some of the things that I um should have been asking you myself a lot you when you know when I was much younger um how come nobody told me that you know I I really need to think about these important questions in my life but honestly I was so focused on short-term goals you know getting the best uh job that I can getting to the best goal that I really never had the time to learn about myself which we'll talk about today um so after a long long journey I found myself into the world of coaching and Um I think um there was a time in my life when I was really really frustrated because I felt like um after getting all the degrees and jobs like my life felt so wrong. I I felt like I won the race but I was in the wrong race and how come nobody told me that I should think about what kind of race I want to run in. And um you know I've tried I was so desperate so I tried a lot of different things. I um wrote and published a book about people who pursue their dreams. I started a community to help people pursue their dreams. I um became a speaker. So, I started to speak a lot. And then um there was also a time in my life when I felt really frustrated because I felt like uh my resume was honestly all over the place and how come I couldn't just like find this one thing. And I thought about even though I've tried a lot of different things that seemed to be unre related to each other out of all the things that brought me real joy um and I found it to be really meaningful had uh common themes and that was people and stories. So that's when I um launched my podcast. Um some of you may have checked it out. It's called Live Your Dream with Celina Lee. And I interview a lot of people through interesting career uh transitions and um learn about the lessons they learned in their own journey in uh Korean life. I also share my stories too. Um if you want to check out one episode um this is actually one of the most popular episode called how to make yourself happy. It's actually an interview a conversation with the really successful famous lawyer. Michael Kim is the founder of the law firm Cobra and Kim. We don't really talk about law but we talk about how to make yourself happy. So if you are interested, you're I hope you can check it out. It's a really really fun episode. Um everything that I uh will be sharing today, including uh the uh some of the podcasts uh that I will mention um I put together in one link. So if you take your phone and then scan this code, it will take you right to the site where it will uh list all the resources that I'm going to be mentioning. So you don't have to take notes. You can just pay attention to what we're talking about.\nOkay. So, how do we find true career fulfillment? Um, I am really interested in the human arc of life. How people become who they are? What decisions and actions shape their career history and and and influence their life? And how do people become who they are? Honestly, I feel like it's not something we learned in school or from families. And after interviewing a lot of successful people for my book and my podcast also um you know coaching many people I've learned that there was a distinct patterns and themes that kept coming up the difference between people who really figured out and became very successful and people who remain stuck. And then when I saw that pattern I decided to design a coaching framework around it and it's called love. L O V E. So if you want to be fulfilled in your career all you need is love. It's an acronym. So, um L stands for learn about yourself. O stands for overcome internal obstacles. Uh V stands for visualize your success. And E stands for explore and take action. And we're going to uh take you I'm going to give you overview of the love framework today. So, the first step is learn about yourself. Uh gaining self-awareness and knowing our values are the first step towards doing work that is aligned with who we are. I've um thought it was really interesting because as I you know started my journey as a coach, I'm kind of in a unique uh situation where people tell me things that they haven't even told their closest friends or their family members. And so I got to really learn a lot about the the unique human journey like why some people are so unhappy even after achieving all of their goals. Um, I mean, these are really hardworking people who put in a lot of effort to achieve their goals, really good people who do good work. And then so many people seem to be unhappy. And then I've learned that it's because they made a decision that was not right for them. It's not like a bad decision, but you know, they um choose a job or a career that was not right for them. They get into relationships, you know, they choose a partner that was not right for them and also other smaller big decisions that was not right for them. So, I started to wonder like why is it that so many people um make a wrong decision for themselves. And I've learned that it's because they haven't taken the time to learn about themselves and then to learn about their values. So, if you don't really know who you are and what you want and what your values are, um you you don't have any uh kind of a guideline in terms of like what would be a good uh decision for you. So you start to kind of choose randomly or listen to other people about what kind of job you should have or what kind of person you should marry and then um and chances are you know that that might not be the best decision for you. So that's when I decided when I discovered that like really learning about yourself is the most important first step of our life and how come nobody teaches us that you know like when I remember when we're in um you know law school we learned a lot about you know how to be a good lawyer and then you know when we're going to college we have to take the SATs and there's all these things that we have to you know do to do well in our career but I feel like the most important thing we need to learn is to learn about ourselves and nobody taught me that and I felt like I'm the classic example of the person who didn't really know what she wanted. So even after achieving all the goals I thought wanted, I thought I you know would make me happy and I felt very unfulfilled. So how do we learn about ourselves? Um it's through paying attention to your emotions. So this is a question that you can ask yourself. How did my feelings today help me to learn more about myself? What did my emotions both positive and negative tell me about what is important to me? From now on, I want you to treat your emotion as a clue. It's an information. So, um I know that a lot of us are afraid of our emotions or we suppress them or we judge them. Now, from now on, I want you to become a curious observer of your emotion. Create some distance between yourself and your emotions as if you're like a third party observer and watch your emotions. Maybe um let's say if you're in a movie theater, you're in the audience and in the screen there's a a movie of your inner experience. You're just kind of carefully observing it. And then um you'll start to notice, ooh, I'm a person when XYZ situation happens, I'm really unhappy. Oh, when ABC situation happens, I'm really happy. So, you'll start to notice, you know, um you know, what makes you happy, what makes you unhappy, when you're really upset. And this is how you're going to learn about yourself because we're all unique. You know, everyone's uh different. And then I think a lot of times people really get into situations that is not right for them because we confuse what we want with what we think we should want. And and I'm sure a lot of you might resonate with this. Um there's a lot of uh societal programming that gets in the way of really being honest about what we want and to have the courage to go after what we want. So the first step is to pay attention to your emotion and use it as a clue to learn about yourself. This is really important because this is also related to our values. Uh values are what makes our life meaningful and interesting and fulfilling. These are your inner compass, your inner navigation. Um this is your north star. I do have to make uh a distinction that values are not moral morals or ethics. Um, when you live your values, it doesn't mean you're doing the right thing or you're doing what you should be doing. It means you're doing the thing that makes you feel right. Uh, when you're honoring your core values, you're going to feel very happy and incredibly, you know, satisfied and fulfilled. On the other hand, um, when you are um feeling really upset or frustrated, chances are some of your most important values are being threatened or it's being taken away from you. Um there is a value assessment that I have all my clients do and all my clients from uh Leo Gym Club. Unfortunately, we don't have time to do to today to to do that today because I was only given an hour. But um I have a value assessment which is uh I shared on that link that I've shared with you before and also there's a podcast episode that walks you through it. So you're welcome to do it. And um I've learned that by paying attention to\n\n\nMy emotions and also doing the value assessment that one of my core values is freedom and meaningful work and helping people.\nAnd when I was working as a corporate lawyer at a big law firm in New York City, I was really unhappy even though I've achieved all the goals.\nSo it was honestly very confusing because if you're unhappy because you didn't achieve your goals, maybe work harder to achieve your goals and maybe you'll be happy, right?\nBut then I've achieved all my goals I thought I wanted in my life, and then I was so unhappy.\nSo it was incredibly confusing.\nSo then I started to really analyze the situation and ask myself, what is it about this job that I'm really unhappy about?\nAnd then I learned that it wasn't the amount of work.\nYou know, as a corporate lawyer and also as an investment banker, you do have to work a lot of hours.\nI'm a hardworking person, so, you know, I can do, I can work long hours.\nBut it was what I hated more than the amount of work was the unpredictability of my schedule.\nI really could not plan my life as a corporate lawyer, investment banker.\nLike I didn't even know when I could go home today.\nI didn't know if I could plan my weekend or how my weekend will be.\nThere were many times when I had to cancel vacations last minute.\nI was always like the friend that canceled last minute, and I really, really hated that.\nAnd then I then understood that, wow, like it's really important for me to have the freedom and autonomy over how I spend my time, and that was really, really important to me.\nA lot of times it's through painful emotions that you're going to really discover what is the most important to you.\nA lot of times it's those painful moments that could give you a better clue than when you're happy because that's a very powerful indicator.\nSo because when you flip pain, it really reveals what's the most important to you.\nAnother thing was I really, you know, wanted to do something meaningful.\nAnd I remember when I was working at the law firm, one of the pro bono assignments was to help a domestic violence victim.\nAnd that was really amazing.\nI still remember it.\nIt was so meaningful and fulfilling.\nBut whereas on the other hand, when I was reviewing contracts to help rich people become richer, which is my job as a private equity lawyer, I was not very happy.\nSo I've also learned that it's very important for me to do work that I believe is meaningful and that I was really helping people, like that I really wanted to help.\nSo I hope you can do the value assessment.\nThis is one of the most important exercises that you can do for your career.\nSecond step is for the love framework is overcome internal obstacles.\nSo many of us stand in our own way of living the life we want because fear stops us from taking action.\nSo it's really crucial to overcome internal obstacles and learn how to reframe failures and rejections and to learn how to manage our inner negative voice.\nIf you're human, you probably have an inner negative voice.\nI have one, too.\nIt's that voice that says, you know, you're not good enough.\nWho do you think you are?\nIt's never going to happen for you.\nAnd chances are you know this, you spend a lot of time with this inner negative voice.\nIt's not all that, the inner negative voice, I think at its core, its job is to protect us.\nAnd I think it actually has to do with survival.\nSo many, many years ago when our ancestors lived in a tribe, the people who had the loudest inner negative voice probably, you know, had a better chance to live and to pass down their DNA onto us.\nBecause if you're like, \"Oh, everything's going to be fine. Don't worry about it,\" maybe we've been eaten by lions or tigers, right?\nBut if you're worried like, \"Oh my god, what if there's an intruder tonight or what if lions come and eat us tonight?\"\nMaybe that inner negative voice will make you worry and then we'll come up with some ideas as to protect your tribe.\nSo maybe you'll build fences or people will rotate and, you know, protect the tribe at night and things like that, right?\nSo it's not all bad.\nIt's, you know, it's trying to keep you safe, but a lot of times it's actually not helpful because it gets the context wrong, where we no longer live in a world where, you know, our daily existence is threatened every single day, but a lot of times our inner negative voice comes up when we're applying for jobs or, you know, going after our goals and dreams.\nSo it is helpful to make sure that it is not stopping you from taking action towards your goals and dreams, and one good way to do that is to name it and then to give it a character, kind of like naming your pet.\nI'm sure some of you have dogs or cats or some other pet, and like you name your pet, you name your inner negative voice.\nSo mine is called Shrek.\nI don't know.\nI just think it's Shrek is a funny-looking character.\nSo whenever I hear my own inner negative voice, it helps me to not take it so seriously.\nSo even though I'm a trained coach, you know, I do have an inner negative voice because I'm a human, right?\nAnd then I'll say, \"Hell, like who do you think you are?\nIt's never going to happen.\"\nYou know, people laugh at you.\nAnd then I can literally talk to Shrek like, \"Shrek, I know you're here.\nUm, I know you're trying to keep me safe, but you're really not helping because I'm about to give a big presentation.\"\nSo, you know, why don't you go away, and then Shrek will go away.\nIt will come back.\nBut so, basically, you can kind of know that this inner negative voice is part of you but not all of you.\nAnd how much power you give to it is entirely up to you.\nSo one of your assignments is to, you know, think about your inner negative voice and then to give it a name or to, you know, create a visual.\nUh, anybody watch this movie Inside Out?\nOh my god, I loved it so much.\nI remember the movie was about anxiety, and gosh, I wish this movie was out when I was a student because I was a very anxious kid.\nI was a very anxious student, especially at Berkeley Law, my 1L year.\nOh my god, it was, I was, when I think about my time at Berkeley, I just feel so sad for myself because I remember I had left finance, investment banking to go to law school, and then when I started law school, I saw my colleagues at investment bank like rise up through the ranks and people got promoted and all these things, and I had to, I wanted to convince myself I made the right decision by leaving and then going to law school, and so like I had to, like this had to work out.\nAnd my 1L year, I like it was so sad because I, I went to MIT for undergrad.\nSo, I feel like I wasn't really well prepared for law school exams, you know, like the essay type of exams.\nSo, I just stayed home by myself, didn't talk to anyone and just like studied all the time.\nAnd the whole time throughout law school, I was really anxious about, you know, can I get a job?\nYou know, would this thing work out?\nAnd I was just worried and wasted all my time just worrying and being anxious all the time.\nUm, after I left law school and then started, you know, working as a lawyer in New York City, I went back to Berkeley and I was so shocked to notice how incredibly beautiful the Berkeley campus was.\nI had no idea because I spent, I wasted my whole time worrying.\nSo, it's one of my biggest regrets in my life.\nAnd then I've learned that, you know, to trust myself, to, you know, know that things will work out.\nSo yes, I have a lot of anxiety, but you know, it's helpful to know that, like, are you going to give your anxiety who has access to the control panel?\nAnd remember at the end of the movie it says, \"I was just trying to help.\"\nUh, yes, I think that's what a lot of our, um, what we think is seemingly negative emotion does, but then you have the power to really manage it in a way that is helpful for you.\nOkay.\nSo I want you to think about an idea that excites you.\nSo, I'll give you like one second to think about it.\nLike, it doesn't have to be a huge dream.\nIt could just be a side project.\nWhatever you think, oh my god, if this could happen, it would be so amazing, right?\nSo, I'm sure I hope you can at least think of something.\nSo, for me, it was writing a book.\nIt was, I wanted to write a book ever since I was like a little girl.\nUm, it was my childhood dream.\nI thought it would be so fun to have one book with my name on it.\nAnd when I was kind of struggling in my career path and I didn't really know what I wanted to do next, you know, this is when I was working as a lawyer, I thought it'd be so fun to write a book and get it published.\nAnd the idea was interview successful people who seem to have figured it out, you know, who seem to have, you know, really fulfilling and meaningful life and fulfilling career.\nHow did they know that's what they want to do with their life?\nI wanted to interview successful people about their career journey.\nSo that was an idea, but then as soon as I thought of the idea, all these unhelpful thoughts start to attack me.\nUm, what if I get rejected?\nWhat if they start to say no?\nRight?\nChances are you might be doing it to your idea too.\nSo if you think about it, in the beginning it was just a fun idea.\nIt was a great idea, right?\nLike, oh, wouldn't it be fun if I can do XYZ, make this happen?\nAnd then as soon as you think of that, you know, these unhelpful thoughts will start to come and attack it.\nYou know, it's never going to happen.\nWhat if you get rejected?\nYou know, what if you do a terrible job?\nAnd then what happens is that you feel bad about yourself and bad about the idea.\nAnd then, you know, what's the point?\nSo you know, you wouldn't take any action, right, because you're feeling bad about it.\nAnd then what, what happens next?\nThere's no book.\nYou don't become an author.\nSo this is how the pattern goes.\nSo your thoughts affect your feelings.\nYour feelings affect your actions, and it literally creates your realities and future.\nSo this is really important for you to think about.\nSo even if with no effort, we can, we're going to automatically think what if it doesn't work out, like just your versions of Shrek, your inner negative voice will get you there, no problem.\nSo you owe it to yourself and to your dream to also think about what is, what if it does work out?\nBut if you do write the book and get it published and it's read by lots and lots of people and it changes your life, how amazing would that be?\nAnd that's what happened to me.\nSo you owe it to yourself to think about the best-case scenario, not just the worst-case scenario.\nSo let's flip this.\nSo instead of thinking, oh, what if it doesn't work out?\nWhat if it does work out?\nWhat if, you know, I write it and then it gets published and people read it and how amazing would that be?\nThen when you're thinking of these thoughts that are helpful to you, it's going to generate a lot of positive emotions.\nSo you're going to feel good, and then you're going to be so excited to make it happen.\nSo you're going to start to take action, and then you one day you might get your book published, and that's what happened to me.\nSo this is a very important pattern and framework that I want you to remember.\nThere's always a thought behind an emotion.\nSo whether you think you're feeling good or bad, you know, you want to pause and be like, \"Oh, what was I thinking about?\"\nYou know, and so what you want to ask yourself is, is my thought helping me or hurting me?\nI actually think about this often throughout the day.\nI'm not saying like positive thoughts or negative thoughts.\nI don't think that's as helpful.\nBut, you know, whatever your goals and dreams are.\nSo let's say if you are going through a career transition, you want to get a job, but then you're like, \"Well, last time I applied, I got rejected.\nSo what's the point of applying?\"\nWell, is that thought helping you to achieve your goal of getting a job?\nProbably not, right?\nBecause it wouldn't help you to, you know, take action.\nAnd if you don't take any action, nothing's going to happen.\nSo, you want to make sure that your thoughts are always aligned with your goals and it is helping you instead of hurting you.\nRejection.\nOh my god, it's a big topic.\nUh, this is a huge reason why people are living their fears and not living their dreams.\nAnd I think it makes sense, you know, as a human, we are really afraid of rejections.\nI also think that has to do with our survival too.\nSo, you know, thousands of years ago when our ancestors lived in a tribe, because humans are by nature very weak creatures.\nWe're not like strong like lions.\nWe needed each other to survive.\nLike if your tribe rejected you, they didn't like you, they didn't want you, you had no chances to survive.\nSo we were programmed to care a lot about what other people thought of us.\nYou know, what they think of us, that they would accept us and approve of us.\nAnd I think this is why we are so afraid of rejections because the ones who are the most afraid of rejections is a survival mechanism, and then they are the ones who survived and they passed down their DNA onto us.\nSo while it's, it makes sense, it's also not helpful because a lot of times when we're going after our goals and dreams and, um, you know, if you want new opportunities in your life, you do have to take action, and chances are, you know, you might have to face some rejections.\nI learned this when I was writing my book.\nSo my book was an interview book.\nSo I wanted to interview people who are very successful and, you know, share their stories because it was not fiction.\nI needed people to say yes to my interview request before I could write anything.\nAnd when I reached out to all these people, like a lot of times I didn't\n\n\nI didn't even hear back.\nUm, and and so many times a lot of people said no.\nAnd I think trying to write this book, I got more rejections than I've ever gotten my whole entire life until that point in my life.\nAnd honestly, in the beginning, it was really hurtful.\nAnd I started to really feel bad about myself and bad about my idea.\nAnd then one day I thought about why am I getting rejected here?\nAnd then I was like, oh, well, it's because I'm trying to take action towards my goal and my dream of writing a book, which was my childhood dream, right?\nAnd that's the only reason why I'm getting rejected because if I wasn't trying to do that, like nobody has any reason to reject me.\nSo if you actually think about it, the rejection is the evidence of you taking action and then towards your goals and dreams and that you're getting one step closer to making it happen.\nSo when I reframed it like that, it was actually really liberating and I um no longer got so hurt.\nSo after that, I've been doing what's called a rejection challenge, which is really, really fun.\nUm, and basically I challenge myself to get rejected a lot.\nSo, um, I will apply for things.\nI'll reach out to people.\nAnd yes, sure, a lot of times, you know, I don't hear back or I get a no, but I've learned that um when there's enough actions statistically, um, you know, you're going to get a lot of nos, but some of those will be a yes.\nIt just has to happen like that.\nTrust me.\nAnd with those yeses, you go write a book or start a podcast or do whatever you want.\nAnd I've learned that you actually don't need that many yeses to change a course of your life.\nSometimes it takes just one yes to change your life.\nBut in order to get to that yes, you need to go through a lot of nos.\nAnd so this is something that I train a lot of all my clients.\nThis is actually an ongoing assignment for all my one-on-one clients and also all the members of Livia's Dream Club.\nIn the Livia Dream Club, it's actually really fun.\nI have people um go through these rejection challenges and then share it in our community and then we celebrate each other.\nAnd we only focus on the action, not the outcome because you can't control the outcome.\nAnd whoever um gets the most uh collects the most amount of rejection gets an award.\nSo it's like um you're kind of reframing, you're celebrating your courageous action of actually, you know, trying for the things you want rather than just um you know, getting the outcome that you want.\nAnd once you're actually able to figure this out, there's a lot of um there's a lot less competition because most people are so afraid of getting their emotions hurt.\nThey're self-rejecting themselves.\nSo, it's actually really interesting if you think about this because when let's say you feel like applying for a job and then you're like, \"Oh, what's the point?\nI don't want to get rejected so I am not going to apply.\"\nUm, you may or may not get rejected.\nSo you are kind of prioritizing the imagined emotions over your goals and dreams and one you you may or may not get rejected and you may feel kind of you know uh disappointed or not maybe not um but you're kind of prioritizing your imagine emotion which is not real yet over your goals and dreams and this is why I think so many people stay stuck and um so what I would love for you to do is to think about yourself as this you know I'm a person who does rejection challenge and Then I it's it's actually going to be really, really fun.\nUm, you're going to get a lot of opportunities.\nPeople will say, \"Celina, you got you do so many things.\"\nI'm like, \"I honestly I'm not special.\nI just do a lot of rejection challenges and I've gotten to a point where um you know, I try for a lot of different things and then if I hear a no, of course I'm disappointed, but maybe for like five minutes and then five minutes later I've already moved on to the next rejection challenge.\"\nAnd then that's when I'm really proud of myself.\nI got to a point where I am so proud of myself, not for getting the outcome.\nOf course, that's cool, too, but for being this person who's not afraid of, you know, putting myself out there and going for the things that I want, um, and and and know that I, you know, have courage and that I'm resilient.\nAnd then I think that's how I was able to do a lot of things in my life.\nSo, I hope you can try this.\nIt's so fun.\nUm, I have a whole podcast about episode about all the rejections I got while trying to write my book and get it published.\nIt's one of the most popular episode.\nI think people just feel better about themselves about all the rejections they got when they hear my own rejection story.\nSo, you're welcome to check it out.\nIt's called How to Turn No into Yes.\nUm, I want you to think about what would the most brave, courageous, and wise version of you do in a certain situation.\nSo because we're human, we have a wide range of emotions um about situations, about our life and about ourselves, too.\nSo sometimes you're going to feel like a loser and like you can't really do anything and like it's like the worst thing, you know, like I like really hate myself.\nAnd sometimes you feel good about yourself.\nYou're like, \"Oh, okay.\nWell, that was really cool that I did that.\nI'm proud of myself.\"\nYou know, um I hope you have those moments, too.\nAnd that's the most brave and courageous and wise version of you.\nAnd I want you to kind of think about that.\nThat is your inner hero.\nUm, and when you are in a difficult situation, you have to make a very difficult decision or you're up against some challenge or you have uh have to have a very, you know, tough conversation.\nUm, you know, what would the most brave and courageous version of you do?\nThis is your inner hero.\nAnd you can also name him or her or give it a character.\nSo mine is called Judy.\nIt's from the movie Zootopia.\nAnybody seen it?\nIt's one of my favorite movies.\nIt's a uh story of a little rabbit who goes after her childhood dream and, you know, achieves it against all her odds.\nAnd um a lot of my friends told me that, you know, there's a a little rabbit like me and and so yeah, it's such an inspiring movie.\nAnd so I think about when I'm going through a tough time or have to make a diff a difficult decision, I think about what would Judy do over Shrek.\nAnd you know even when I'm feeling like kind of scared or I have fear you know when I'm like trying to do something then I think about what would Judy do what would uh you know what would she do so that way you're able to tap into uh the place of strength and then you're working from a you know place of courage and strength rather than fear and that's how it could change your life too.\nSo um this is one of your assignment.\nI want you to think about the name for your inner negative voice and also inner hero.\nAnd think about this.\nHow would you encourage a dear friend going through a very challenging time?\nAnd let's encourage ourselves in the same way.\nWe have no problem being supportive and kind to other people, the people that we care about.\nBut often times we are the most uh cruel to ourselves.\nSo whenever you're going through a tough time, I want you to talk to yourself as if you're talking to your best friend and then encourage yourself uh from the place of strength from you know your inner hero, not your inner negative voice.\nOkay.\nSo third step for uh love framework is visualize your success.\nVisualizing yourself having achieved your dream will help you to stay motivated, focused and lead you to take action towards making your dream a reality.\nWhen I first heard about visualization, honestly, I was a little bit skeptical.\nUm, I went to an engineering undergrad.\nI went to MIT, so like, you know, I'm like, \"Oh, I'm an analytical person.\"\nSo, I um I don't like these woo things.\nSo, I was honestly really skeptical.\nBut then, because I'm a nerd, I did a lot of research about it.\nAnd then I found out there's a lot of science that back it up.\nSo, for example, in sports psychology, it's called mental imagery training.\nUm when athletes train when they're uh training through uh visualization\num it's as effective as actually training physically.\nHow fascinating is that?\nI thought it was amazing.\nSo I decided to put this into practice.\nSo when I was um writing my book, well I had the idea for writing a book.\nEverybody thought I was crazy.\nI thought people thought I was delusional because I uh wanted to write it in Korean.\nI was born in LA and then I moved to Korea when I was three years old and then I went to an elementary school in Korea and then we our family moved back to Southern California when I was in middle school.\nSo um my education in Korea stopped at an sixth grade and then here I was I wanted to see if I could write and publish a book in Korean and my mom thought I was crazy.\nShe was like it's never going to happen for you.\nWho do you think you are and only successful and famous people write books and honestly it was really hurtful at at the time.\nSo, when I learned about visualization, I decided that I'm gonna do this every night in my bed.\nUm, I'm a night owl, so I tend to go to bed late.\nAnd, uh, this is when Shrek is the loudest.\nOh my god.\nLike, it's the worst.\nIt'll, um, you know, make me think about all the things that could go wrong.\nSo, like the anxiety about the future or the regrets I I have about the past.\nSo, it's not a very fun time for me.\nUm, you know, not always, but sometimes shre can be really loud.\nSo I decided that I'm going to just think about myself having achieved my dream and visualize it.\nSo I thought about my book, which wasn't even written yet.\nI it didn't even have a title, so I didn't know what it would look like, but I just um think thought about this image of my book, you know, prominently displayed in some big bookstore in Korea and just see if I could, you know, do it.\nI thought that would be really fun.\nI also imagined myself becoming a speaker.\nUh at the time, you know, nobody uh invited me to speak about anything because I hadn't done with with my which my done much with my life.\nAnd I thought one day I'm gonna write this book and even though people thought I was crazy and it was never going to happen, uh I'm going to, you know, um one day get it published and then uh speak about my experience of achieving my childhood dream of writing a book and and like how fun would that be?\nAnd uh this is the day my book actually got delivered to me.\nthe day like the first time I got to hold my book which was amazing.\nIt's called got in uh published in Korea.\nI think the best translation would be um live your dream.\nSo it's a stories of people who achieve their dreams and actually the um uh a new updated version will be republished at the end of the year in Korea.\nSo looking really looking forward to that.\nAnd um when my book got published uh my mom who is very against this idea started to brag to her friends.\nShe's like, \"Oh my god, look at my daughter who, you know, published this book.\"\nAnd I told her, \"You don't even have any bragging rights.\nYou are not supportive of my dream.\"\nAnd then I got really curious and I asked her, \"Why were you so against it?\"\nAnd for the first time in her life, she actually apologized to me.\nYou know how moms don't really like to apologize.\nAnd she said, \"I'm sorry.\nI was wrong.\nI really didn't think you could do it.\nSo, I was trying to protect you from getting hurt.\"\nHuh.\nThat's when I learned that parents actually don't want the best for us because they actually don't know what is best for us.\nAnd their role as a parent is to protect us from getting hurt.\nSo from their point of view, if the road we're about to embark on has a high rate of failure, they're going to do whatever it takes to stop us.\nUm, so I'm really glad I didn't listen to my mom because we wouldn't be here right now.\nI wouldn't be here talking to you and sharing with you the story.\nAnd I've learned that when someone says you can't do something, it's uh it's uh they're kind of like um projecting their own insecurities onto onto us.\nSo they're saying, \"If I were you, I couldn't do that.\"\nBut they're not us.\nAnd we don't even know what we're capable until we actually give it a try.\nSo I hope you will give yourself permission to do whatever it is that you want to do.\nThis is uh a picture of when I got invited to speak in Alaska to talk about my childhood dream, how I was able to achieve it.\nSo yes, that visual visualization also became a reality too, you know, for the past uh 101 15 years.\nI've been invited to speak at a lot of amazing stages around the world.\nSo this just goes to show you that visualization can be really powerful.\nUh last tip of the love framework is uh explore and take action.\nUm it's only through action that our lives will change.\nWe need to explore our curiosities and set goals that align with our values and then take steps and action towards the career and and life that gives us joy and meaning.\nTake action is one of the most important step because if you don't do anything nothing's going to happen.\nHere are some of the um ideas I want to share with you about this step.\nUm first follow your curiosities not your passion.\nUh when I was really stuck in my career uh you know back when I was practicing law and I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life um I was really desperate so I would you know go to a lot of talks and read a lot of books about the topic and virtually everybody told me to follow my passion and then I got so annoyed and was it was really frustrating because I was like if I knew what my passion was I already be following it okay like I would not be reading this book so it was not helpful so instead I think what's helpful is to follow your curiosities.\nUm, curiosity is like a little whisper.\nIt's not like burning like screaming, \"Oh my god\n\n\n&quot;This is what you're supposed to do with your life.&quot; But it's like this little interest or, you know, it's like a little whisper. You're like, &quot;Ooh, that sounds cool. Oh, I'm interested in that. Oh, oh, that sounds fun. So, listen to that.&quot; You know, don't suppress it. And I think that's what I did all my life. Even though I had all these interests, I would always kind of stop myself from trying it because I would ask myself, well, is that going to help me get into a better school or is it going to help me get a better job? Is it going to help me, you know, improve my resume? And if for whatever reason, I thought it wouldn't, I wouldn't allow myself to do it. And that's how I think I became this person, even after working so hard for so many years, that I did become this person who doesn't even know what she wants. How sad is that, right? So, this is when I made a promise to myself. This is right before I wrote my book, and I said, from now on, I'm going to give myself the permission to follow my curiosities and do the things that I think is fun and meaningful, even though it has nothing to do with my job. I had no idea if it would really be helpful for my career. But because I gave myself permission, I wrote the book, and then that led to me starting a community to help people pursue their dreams, started to speak a lot, started my podcast, and eventually I found my way into the world of coaching, which actually I realized is my passion and not only a passion, but I feel like it's my calling. So, you start with your curiosities and don't worry about not knowing your passion. If you don't know it, I feel like most people don't know it. There's nothing wrong with you.\n\nAnother thing is, courage is more important than confidence. Um, I think a lot of people, you know, tell me, Celina, if I was just confident, I would do XYZ, and, um, you know, if I could, you know, apply for the job or, you know, go after the dream or build my company or whatever it may be. But I learned in one of my, from a conversation with one of my podcast guests, her name is Debbie Millman. She's a very famous designer, and she said that, um, courage to step into the action of trying is much more than confident, much more important than confidence, because you can't be confident in something you don't have a lot of experience in. So, if you never learn how to ride a bicycle, can you be confident the first time you try? Uh, probably not, right? Because you don't, you, you've never tried it. So, the courage to step into the action of trying is much more important. And then because you had the courage and you maybe the first day you fell, the second day you fell again. But after many days of trying, you will probably be more confident that you know on the 10th day than the first day that you could ride a bike. So that's how you develop confidence. So people get the order wrong. They think they need the confidence and then they'll do the thing. It's actually courage is required first. If you're confident, you don't need courage. And so if you are using lack of confidence as an excuse for not doing anything, remember that courage is more important than confidence. And I learned this from my conversation with Debbie Millman. Uh, the episode is called How to Design and Manifest Your Dream Life. Really fun episode. So you can check that out too.\n\nDream big and start small. Um, you know, a lot of people really, um, you know, have all these things that they want to do. It doesn't have to be some huge dream, but, um, they think about like this amazing thing that they want, but they don't do anything about it. Why? I think it's because they make starting the first action really, really hard. So, whatever it may be, make the action really, really easy. So, when I was writing my book, um, even though I had no idea if anybody was going to say yes to my interview request, I just thought about what is one action I can take today towards my goal and dream. And the first day I would be like, I could create a list of the people I would like to interview. The second day I could find their contact information. The third day I could reach out to them. I don't know if they'll respond or how they'll respond, but I can control my own action of actually trying and reaching out to them, right? And small actions over a long period of time, um, is how you're going to transform your life and you can achieve your big goals and dreams.\n\nThis is an important one, especially for us lawyers. Don't issue spot your dreams. Um, I have a lot of lawyer clients, obviously, because of my background, and, um, you know, a lot of people issue spot our dreams because this is what we're trained in law school. So if you really know how to issue spot, uh, you, well, you probably did well in your law school, and then, but I have to remind you what helps you to, um, you know, build a great career, as what helps you to become a great lawyer, is not going to help you to build a great career. Career exploration, um, doesn't have a very rigid answer. Um, so you have to be flexible and open-minded and curious and be willing to try a lot of different things. And I've seen that how the issue spotting, which is helpful in one area of our life, you know, our legal skills, is really unhelpful and maybe keeping you stuck. So I hope I hope you're not doing that. Um, another thing I learned is that you can be more than one thing. There was a period in my life where I felt so stuck and, uh, because I felt like how is it that I haven't figured out this one thing in my life, you know? And, um, I've learned that a lot of times the identity as a lawyer keeps us stuck too. So, um, I've learned that you can actually be more than one thing. You know, I'm a lawyer, but I'm also a writer. I'm a podcast host. And who knows, you know, I may be trying something else. So, um, it's great that we worked hard to, you know, become a lawyer, but you can be more than that. You could be a lawyer and do something else. So don't let one job identity kind of stop you from trying other things.\n\nDiversify your life portfolio. So, um, as you know, um, I'm sure you know that, um, savvy financial investors will know to diversify their financial portfolio, right? So if you put all your money in the stock market and not crashes, I'm sorry, but you lost everything. And I think we can do the same thing for our life too. A lot of times we make one job or one career, one person, our whole everything, and when that is not going well or that ends, it can feel like death. And so yes, it's great that we are going to work hard on our job and our career. But diversify your life portfolio. Have some hobbies, have some side projects. Uh, invest your time in building supportive communities around you. Have different friend groups. And then when you're going through a hard time, you'll have, you know, in your career or maybe your job, you'll have, um, other sources of joy and meaning to support you through the hard time. And I think that's how you build a resilient life portfolio.\n\nSo this is the LOVE framework for you. Uh, it's important to do this in order because if you haven't done the first step of learning about yourself, you may be setting the wrong goals for yourself and taking actions that are not helpful. Even if you know what you want to do, if your inner negative voice is really strong. So the second step, you haven't done the overcoming internal obstacles, um, you wouldn't be able to take action. And then the more actions you take, the more you learn about yourself. So this is a continuous and evolving process. And trust yourself and trust your journey. Uh, you know, it's really hard being a human. It's hard being a lawyer. I've learned so much about human, human race, human journey. Um, because every day people tell me things that they haven't told even their closest friends or family members. It is really, really hard. So, I hope you can be kind to yourself. And this is the most important reminder to love yourself, to be kind to yourself, to have self-compassion. Um, I've learned that at the foundation of all success and happiness is how we talk to ourselves, how we see ourselves, and the relationship we build with ourselves. And this is why I've designed my coaching for framework, LOVE, loving to love yourself and be kind to yourself. Um, if you enjoyed my presentation today, you might be interested in learning about Libby Dream Club. So, this is basically my life's work. Everything that I've learned in my life, um, I've put together to create Live Your Dream Club. It's a group coaching program and a community designed to help you figure out your next step and to achieve your goals and dreams. And, um, I've actually found that there are three major challenges and why people really can't achieve what they want to do in life. First is, many people don't know what they want to do. So we teach that through the LOVE framework, uh, to doing all these, um, learning all the tools. Second, uh, step is, uh, the second challenge is that people who want to do something, they actually don't have courage, they're so afraid, their inner negative voice so strong that they don't actually try it. So that's the, uh, so we do rejection challenges together, we have a whole community that supports you. The third step is people who are even, you know, trying things. It's really hard to achieve your goals and dreams alone. And this is a question I ask to all my podcast guests, you know, who helps you to get to where you are in your life. And I've heard so many amazing, fascinating stories. So I feel like a lot of times if you have just one person who believes in you, you can have the courage to go after what it is that you really want. And many times that's me for my clients. But I thought how fun would it be if we build a whole community of people to help you? So that's what I'm building. So if you're interested in checking it out, the code will take you to the waitlist. I'll let you know when the next time enrollment opens. This is my vision. Uh, this is really life mission for me. Um, I really want to live in a world where everybody can have the courage to go after what they want. Whether it is, you know, related to career or your personal goals and dreams, and how fun would it be if we could all help each other out. So this is what I'm building. One person in one place helps another person, and that person helps another person, and then around and around, and we, um, help each other, and so many more dreams and goals will become a reality. And so we do a lot of, um, fun events led by members too. So, um, one of the upcoming sessions, we have a medical doctor who's also used to be a DJ, and he also has a podcast on NPR. So he's going to talk about, um, how to, um, how to use stories. So storytelling, how to use stories to influence people. So there's a lot of cool things going on. So hope you can check it out. Uh, the greatest journey starts with the dream, and thank you so much for giving me the time to share about my journey, and hopefully, um, our time together helps you to think about what is that you want to do with your life and what your dream is.\n\nI have some resources that I wanted to share with you, which I didn't have time. So I put together a fun quiz, what's the one thing standing between you and a career. So you can check that out. Um, three steps to finding true career fulfillment. Uh, it's a really important topic, but which we didn't have time to get to. So you're welcome to check it out. And I want to close my presentation today with my favorite quote. Um, as you start to walk on the way, the way appears. It's a quote by Rumi. And you don't have to have it all figured out. You just have to start walking. And this really has been my guiding principle in my life. Um, all the resources I mentioned are here in this code that I've shared with you. So hopefully you can check it out. Hopefully, we can also email it to you. And so, yeah, feel free to check out my podcast. I also do one-on-one coaching and speaking. So, you're welcome to reach out and happy to chat. And there you have it. So, thank you so much for being here. I know we have a few minutes for questions, and I know I tried my best to go over as much as I can. I was only given an hour. So, you know, if you have any questions, you're welcome to reach out to me on LinkedIn. But I think we have a few more minutes for questions, right, Yury?\n\nWe do. Thanks so much, Celina, for that very thought-provoking presentation. Um, we do have a few questions in the chat. So let's see if we can use the last few minutes here to answer them. So first question, um, lawyers changing careers face challenges involving fear of uncertainty, the perceived need to prove their worth in a new field, and overcoming the stigma of leaving the legal profession. Was it difficult for you to manage such a huge reset, and what was your secret?\n\nWow, thank you so much for this question. I know this is a question that I get often, like, how did I transition? How did I leave law? And I totally understand why you may be asking this question because I think as a lawyer, we've worked so hard to earn that title, you know, to have that identity. And I think when I was leaving law, um, there was a lot of uncertainty. I was already very established as a lawyer. I was not established as a coach. And I was really worried about like, what would other people think about me? Um, you know, when you go to like a reception or, um, parties or something, um, people be like, &quot;Oh, what's your name and what do you do?&quot; And then when you say, &quot;Oh, I'm Celina. I work at XYZ law firm.&quot; Like, everybody knows that and nobody asks you any more question. And I was like, how would I even explain what I would do? You know, and that honestly really was a big fear. And then I've actually learned that, um, one, people don't really care that much. Like, we think that like, you know, everyone's like worried about what we're doing. It's actually not true. Everybody's worried about other people think, you know, about them, other people thinking about them. So, one, they're not really thinking much thoughts about our us. So, you know, that's a\n\n\nA little bit of a relief.\n\nAnd then, two, is that much more than what we do. I've learned that, um, how we think and feel about what we do affects how other people think about us. So, for example, if I go to a reception and then people are like, \"Oh, what do you do?\" And, you know, if I was a not a very happy lawyer, uh, I'm not a very interesting conversation partner. But now, you know, when I go to like a networking event, you know, I'm like obsessed with what I do. This is my life's work, right? So, I'm like so excited and happy. I can't stop talking about it. And then I now am more popular, uh, you know, during, um, these events. So, um, I've learned that it's how other people think about you and your job and what you do has less to do with your job title, but how you think about what you do, how you feel about what you do. I think that's also important.\n\nAnother thing about transition is that if you think that, um, oh, if I quit law and do something else, I'm a failure, you know, I'm a quitter, and people think that like I'm like haven't made it or something like that. If you're, if you think like that, it's going to be very, very hard for you to quit. Uh, but so I don't, you know, practice law anymore. I guess I could, but I, I don't really want to. But, you know, if I think that, oh my god, like that's such a waste of time going to Berkeley Law and, you know, taking the bar exam. Uh, oh my god, what a waste of time. Then it would, I would really feel like I failed, right? But instead of that, I decided to think that because I went through law school, you know, I am able to coach a lot of my clients who are lawyers, not all of them, but many of them. And then everything that I learned through law school and, you know, practicing law enables me to do the work I do. I relate to people who work incredibly hard and achieved really amazing things and who still feel unfulfilled and feel stuck, and that's a very unique position to be in, and I wouldn't have been able to relate to the experience had I not gone through that. So it's, you know, it's reframing, it's thinking about, um, a lot of times it is in our head, like, you know, all these, uh, scary thoughts. People actually, I think, think what I do is cooler than when I was practicing law at a big law firm. So I hope, you know, my story helps you to kind of have a more helpful thought. Remember, uh, is your thought helping you, hurting you, right? And you can, you have the power to reframe your situation and your decision in a way that actually helps you to move forward and not stay stuck.\n\nAnd Celina Lee, I think you may have at least partially answered the next question, but I'm going to ask it anyway, which was, uh, from your perspective, what are the merits of being a law school graduate after one pursues the non-legal path or career?\n\nUm, you mean, uh, doing the non-legal path first and then going to law school?\n\nThe opposite. So, you went to law school, it sounds like you went to law school, and and so how did that help or what are the merits of that? Uh, you know, given that you've now transitioned into a non-legal career.\n\nYeah. So I think that law school, uh, you know, and legal education or being a lawyer actually opens up so many possibilities. It's actually amazing preparation for many, many different career paths. Um, for me, one is I can relate to a lot of the struggles of, of, you know, lawyers who are going through a tough time in their career journey. So I get to support them, and I think even when I wrote my book and got it published, you know, it's a very solitary experience of like having to write your book. Uh, the training I went through in law school of just like sitting on your butt for like 10 hours and getting the work done, you know, doing the hard work. Um, you know, just showing up for the goal that you are, you know, you told yourself that you're going to pursue and getting it done. I think that was an amazing preparation when I wrote and published my book and just the hard work, and that I think is an amazing preparation, and you know, being a good writer, being able to communicate your thoughts, uh, you know, well, verbally and also in written form, I think that's an incredible preparation. And honestly, and I know, I know this sounds, sounds kind of funny, too, but when you say even if you're not practicing law anymore, when you say you went to law school and then you went to school like Berkeley, a good law school like Berkeley, people will just automatically assume that you're kind of smart, and this actually is one of the benefits even when you're not practicing law anymore. So, um, like there's that assumption that you are smart and you're hardworking, that you are this person who can do hard things. So I think, um, when it's, it's, it stays with you forever. Even if you don't practice law anymore, all that you've done, you know, up until this point of going to law school and, you know, taking the bar exam and practicing law, that is part of your experience, and you bring your whole self to the table for your next career path. And when I was training, uh, to become a coach, that's why my coaching instructor told me that Celina, you are, you know, when I was, um, a newbie coach, when I was just getting started, I had a lot of imposter syndrome. I was like, \"Oh my god, I don't even, I don't, how can I coach people? I just graduated from the coaching school, right?\" And he said that you're bringing your whole self to this new, uh, you know, chapter of your life, and all that you've done before is not wasted. It is still part of you. So I think there's a lot of, um, you know, things that will, you'll carry through to your next, uh, chapter of your life, whether you practice law or not, and it's, it's really like how you think. If you think that it was a complete waste of time, yes, it will be, but if you think that I everything that I've done before has enabled me to do what I do now, and then, then that's how that's how it will be, and that's how people will see you.\n\nCelina, there are a lot of good questions here actually, and I'm gonna take the prerogative to go a few minutes over if you'll indulge us.\n\nHappy to.\n\nUm, next question is, um, can you talk through strategies for dealing with the financial challenges of leaving a stable career for a less certain one?\n\nYeah, this is a thing that comes up often in coaching sessions. Of course, um, you know, we do have to worry about financial security because that's how we pay the bills and, you know, have a place to sleep and eat and things like that. I had a lot of fear around financial security, too, because I live in New York City. I live in Manhattan in Chelsea. When I was leaving law, I had actually bought my condo and had mortgage to pay. I signed contract, right? So, I had this big fear that, oh my god, what if I can't pay my bills? And I also didn't want to leave New York. I didn't want to change my life that much. So, um, I think it was really, um, scary. Uh, but then the way that I thought about was, um, I think a lot of times people inflate financial fear. So, like it's actually helpful to think about like how much do you really need to survive and, you know, um, to do the things that you want to do. And then I think a lot of times it's not like genuinely you might go bankrupt, but people just have this kind of abstract number of like, oh my god, I need like a zillion dollars to to do whatever, or it might be keeping up with the Jones, you know, like, oh, so and so makes so much money, what, you know, so is it real fear? I think you have to really assess, um, like how much money do you need to actually do the things you want to do, and it's different for everyone. So for me, I, you know, I saved up some. And I also thought about it this way. So being a lawyer was is not easy, right? I was, it's not like, oh, I just like kind of hang out and I get, you know, paid a lot. You really have to work a lot. So I thought I am working for someone else and someone else's dream because, you know, as a as a lawyer, um, especially at the law firm, um, I was assisting other people's goals and and projects and their dreams, and I thought I'm working so hard for somebody else. Um, if I work just as hard for myself and for my goal and to build my own thing, is there a chance that one day I will be able to be financially secure? And I thought, you know what, there's a decent chance, not right away, but I think I could see the possibility that it might happen. So, at that point, whenever I, um, had that fear of like financial fear or, you know, financial insecurity, I let that fear kind of motivate me to take action. You know, I reached out to people. Um, I let people know about, you know, what I'm building and things like that. So, I think, um, you have to be really realistic about like how much do you really need and then to know that it may not be a, you may be inflating it. And also know that more money doesn't necessarily mean more happiness. I've, I have a, I have a lot of clients who are incredibly successful financially. You know, some famous people. It's not always happy. Like I've, I've learned that, um, I've read somewhere that money is kind of like a negative happiness. If you don't have any of it, like it's like health. If you don't have any health or don't have any money, you're going to be very unhappy. But just because you have more, it doesn't mean you're going to be happy. So you have to kind of think about that, too. So I hope that's helpful.\n\nThere's a song, Selena, \"More Money, More Problems.\" So\n\nyes, for some people that is also true, too.
