  "cleanText": "People who have an insane ability to\ndeal with pain is really important. I\nenjoy pain. I enjoy creation. I enjoy\ndisrupting things. In all of this, the\nthing that I truly enjoy is making\nsomething really big. The effort\nrequired to build for a small market\nlike India or the effort required to\nbuild for a global market. The delta\nbetween the two is very small.\nEverybody's expecting you to do like the\nobvious. The game was all about not\ndoing the obvious, but you got to play\nthat game at that moment when you could\nclearly see it's not going to work out.\nSo, I had about four failed startups\nbefore a movie, which was my minus one\nto nothing. Zero is an amazing place to\nbe at is what I would say.\nWho we have on the stage today is Naveen,\nand he doesn't really need an\nintroduction, right? But um I usually do\nthis so I'll still go ahead and make one,\nright? Uh of course he's the autonomous\nentrepreneur who put India on the tech\nmap, right? So India's first unicorn, of\ncourse, uh now with Glance and Glance\nAI and Raposu and Nostra, uh he is uh I\nthink he built the first unicorn even\nbefore unicorn was a dinner table word,\nright? So uh and before VCs or uh and\nactually world building was not even uh\npart of the lexicon, right? And uh kind\nof set the way out. Okay. And why in 2007\nuh he was already pioneering mobile ads\nand actually going up against Google at\nthat point in time in some ways, right?\nThere were of course millennial media\nand a bunch of other guys. Uh and uh\ntoday in movie is de profitable 7 years\nin counting and 10 years in counting. I'm\nsorry. I think uh you know what I'm\nreally sorry. You know what my interns, I\nhad like four interns working with me on\nthis, which is Gemini, Grock, Mr. Lord,\nand you know miss 4.0, but uh you know\nhard at work, we all, but still we got\nsomething wrong here, right? Uh Naveen is\nan IIT Kanpur and Harvard Business\nSchool alum. He spends his time not only\nbuilding companies but also mentoring\nthe next wave of founders, people who are\nset on transforming the economy one big\nidea at a time.\nYou know what, uh when I asked 4.0 that\nuh what should be a title, right? Uh or\n4.0, not 4.0, I think somebody will kill\nme for that, but uh maybe in this crowd\nonly, but for that what should be the\ntitle of this talk, right? And uh you\nknow, we typically do this as minus one\nto now, which is the reason why we call\nit minus one to Naveen, but for had a\nsuggestion that uh it should be\nconviction before consensus, right? Uh and\nI thought it was interesting and uh maybe\nlet's start off with personal\nconvictions and uh all of us are uh while\nwe all uh in this community, we are\ntrying to figure own figure out our own\nminus one to zeros. But original stories\nare almost always interesting. So maybe\nuh maybe we can start off with a bit of\noriginal story and uh maybe if you were\nto turn the clock back and you can talk\nabout what were the pivotal moments that\ninfluenced a your value system and the\nway you think, right? And possibly got\nyou to the point where we are today,\nright? Uh it might be interesting to\nstart off there.\nUm thank you for inviting. I think you\nknow if uh and when I started the\ncompany, if some such community existed,\nI would be so, you know, it be amazing.\nUm look, I started it, I started u trying\nto do my startup in 2005. So I had about\nfour failed startups before InMobi.\num which was my minus one to nothing\nphase. Zero is an amazing place to be at\nis what I would say, firstly, right? So\nif somebody gets to zero, that's like\nyou should congratulate yourself that you\ngotten to the zero because that's zero,\nright? Uh but I had minus one to nothing\nbunch of those phases where\nuh I thought I build on worked on some\nvery cool ideas. So my first one which I\nlike, it was a company called VCube.\nOkay. And it was a voiceover IP. So I\nwould take my, my team would do all these\ncodecs and they would build them and the\nthe the networks were not 3G then.\nThere was an era where the networks were\nnot 3G.\nSo it was like 2G networks. This is the\nUS, not India, in in the US, 2G\nnetworks. So I would take the, I would\ntake the my phone which would be turning\nhot because this the system was running\non it and I would walk, I would take my\ncar and you know, whatever, go down San\nFrancisco roads and and make phone calls\nand I would sound weird on the other side\nall the time. So I did this for almost 9\nmonths and I thought I had something\nvery good and then you know, once we got\nthe product to a certain stage, I went to\nyou know, some renowned people called the\ninvestors, right? So I reached out to\nthem and I said, hey look, and I knew a\nlot of them because I used to work for a\nventure firm, right? So I knew a lot of\npeople, u so I reached out to them and\nyou know, they would all welcome me\ninside and one of them kind of sat me\ndown, heard my pitch and then rammed me\nso hard, so hard that my co-founder quit\nend of that meeting.\nOkay, he quit at the end of that meeting\nand I was like, damn.\nSo I, you know, I had, you know, I, I\nyou know, resilience, right? So I kind of\nresisted for like a whole week\nand I thought about what he told me, like\nhe basically told me, Naveen, what your\nand this is like\ntier one plus plus plus venture\ncapitalist, right? So they're they're\nsupposed to be smart, right? So so they're\nbasically telling me, Naveen, in if do\nyou really think voiceover IP would ever\nwork in the world? I said, but why not,\nlike it's free call. And my reason of by\nthe way being excited about this, I'll\ntell you was because I would call India,\nlike my you know, parents and you know,\nfamily, it was very costly. So I was like\nthis is such a cool thing, I can call\noverseas like for free, right? So that\nwas the whole genesis. They basically\nsaid, hey, voice of will never take off\nbecause the minute telcos and carriers\nand everybody realizes that you're\nriding on their data pipe, they would\nbuild this themselves and they would\nkill you.\nVery logical.\nVery logical. So I gave up.\nI gave up. And my first lesson in life\nwhich I learned much later was that you\ngot to have your own conviction and you\ngot to stay to it. Not that I, you know,\nin hindsight I worry about the fact\nbecause I think I did well. But\nthat's not the point. And I think the\npoint is I gave up because some idiot\nwho has who was sitting on a porch just\nbecause he had a pile of money thought\nthat my idea was bad. I think I should\nhave taken his input\nand but stayed at it because I worked on\nit for maybe you know, a little less than\n12 months, nine months for sure and I\ngave up and I won't say I regret it, but\nI just have this thing to say,\nI don't listen to people anymore.\nI don't, it's not, let me rephrase that.\nI don't get influenced by people easily.\nI hear what people say, I kind of put it\nin.\nBut I think if there is one thing I've\nbuilt with with that experience is I\nhave very high level of conviction\nand I back it.\nInteresting. Well, thanks for sharing. I\nthink um let's talk about the M-Code days\nin the SMS advertising, right? And from\nthat to becoming InMobi.\nThat was the last point on to nothing.\nYeah. And we'll do a little bit of fast\nforward here because um I think there's\na lot of interesting stuff uh in your\njourney that we want to touch, but talk\nto us\nspeakless\nsoon. So talk to us about uh that\njourney of\na uh finding fellow believers and um\nthen uh finding the proverbial uh let's\nsay, let's call it product market fit,\nright? Uh uh and actually seeing the\nconviction come alive, right? Uh it would\nbe yeah, we'd love to hear about that.\nYeah, look, I think on on M-Code, which\nwas basically SMS-based search name\nsuggest, right? M\nthat was one where we got convinced\nourselves that it's not the right thing\nto do. So the conviction worked the\nother way, but we backed it because it's\nokay, right? You can be convinced either\nway, it's not to say I should always be\npositively convinced, so that was a case\nof like there was a company, I forget the\nname, ask something, uh\naska\nask.laa, that's correct, right? And\nMatrix put about $10 million into it\nand um they evaluated us and them and\nthey put money into them, this is not\ngoing to work\nuh because it just does, like we were\nrunning it, it just didn't seem to work.\nSo therefore the conviction was that this\nis the wrong thing to do. Uh so I think\nthe month they got the funding, we\nactually changed the idea, convinced\nclearly that it doesn't matter if we did\nsomebody get did get funding on it. It's\nnot the right place to be at, uh it\nworked for us. Uh so that's the that's\nthe other concept of it. Now finding you\nsaid who\nfellows? Ah yes, I think that that was\nhard at that time, by the way. uh both\nfinding fellow believer, like there was\nthere would be no way such a community\nwould even come together, by the way, like\nwe had issues in like, well, firstly, I\ngetting my co-founders was like an\namazing thing because um like nobody\nwould talk about this whole thing of I\nwant to start a company because the\nminute you said you want to start a\ncompany, it's like you're totally\nunemployable\nemployable, like nobody's hiring you,\ntherefore you're you're trying to do\nthis, right? So when I found a way,\nWe spent, we, I knew him from my\nundergrad, right? And we spent two\nhours. We never talked about what I am\ntrying to do and what he's trying to do.\nIt's only in the last 5 minutes we said,\nokay,\nwhat are you planning to do? He's like\nmaybe\nI'm the point I'm trying to make is uh\nthe\nwe never back, we never, and then of\ncourse got Amit and you know, Moit and\neverybody, we never cared about like who\nbrought what on the table as long as you\nhad the conviction to stay. Look, this\njourney, minus one to zero, zero to one\nor whatever you call that, right? Bunch\nof these journeys, even like now we are\nat 100 to thousand, right? It is so hard\nthat every day you want to quit many a\ntime, many times a day, it just you just\nwant to make sure that four people don't\ndecide to quit at the same time, okay?\nThat was the only thing we cared about,\nlike if four people decided to quit at\nthe same time, then we're dead, right? So\nfor example, if 10 a.m. I want to quit,\nthen three others should not be thinking\nabout quitting at that moment. That was\nthat was it. That's how we vibed, man.\nAnd it worked because nobody quit,\nright? Nobody quit. Not nobody quit the\ncompany and nobody quit each other. That\nwas it. That that was that was the only\nthing we could. And so we didn't really\ncare. I hear a lot of people talk about,\nhey, I'm trying to find complimentary\nsomething. No, no, no. Don't try to find\ncomplimentary something. Just try to\nmake sure that you know there are people\nwho can keep you alive. And that's very\nimportant.\nAmazing. You know, we have this uh I\npersonally use this airport test. You're\nstuck with this person at the airport\nfor 4 hours. Would you want to be stuck\nwith this person or not? Right? And\nhence everything uh whether it's a value\nsystem or whether does a person\ninteresting enough and are you going to\nbe really vibing? But you know, it's one\nthing about starting and uh finding\nco-founders. The other one is staying\nalong and walking uh both the crest and\nthe troughs alongside, right? And\nsomehow you guys have made it happen,\nright? Uh it's almost what 17 years now.\n18 years this year. Yeah.\n18 years. Wow. Almost. The relationship\nis coming of age.\nYeah. My daughter also turned 18.\nYeah. Amazing.\nBoth are same age.\nYeah. Turning.\nSo uh so talk to us about what worked,\nright? I know that Amit then started\nYulu, but even he like completely feels\nis in completely, right? So uh\nyour neighbors\nof course.\nYeah. You're passing your airport test,\nman.\n100%. Yeah. Uh so, so, so talk to us\nabout what worked, right? And what were\nyour rituals and um and maybe talk to us\nabout a couple of instances when you\nactually thought you guys are not going\nto make it right together, right? How\ndid\njust as a team?\nAs a team, of course, as a team.\nI don't think that ever happened.\nOkay. We have decided like for some odd\nreason and you know, like if you talk at\nlow moments to like and we've talked\nabout this in our low moments, like a\nwould stand up and say\nyou know, we'll just die together. There\nis that level of like camaraderie, uh uh\ntogetherness\num like we will all quit together\nwhenever we do. There is that level of\nuh thing that we are in this together.\nwe'll just do this. Now, of course,\npeople will reach different stages of\nlife, you know, later on and that's\nfine. But we've never had, firstly, we've\nnever had anybody sitting back and\nsaying, I think I want to quit.\nOkay. Second,\nuh do we have fights quite a bit?\nBut I think fights are important. We\nactually never have, we never have trust\nissues with each other.\nI could think that he's not thinking\nright, which I may do most of the time,\nright? Or they could do the same thing,\nbut it's never on the intent of what we\nreally want to do. Um so I think in\nterms of intent\nin terms of ambition,\nthose are two or three areas where we\nare very highly aligned, right? We we\nthink we have not achieved anything\ntoday, for example, like we have uh we\ncan easily grow grow like 10 to 50x from\nwhere we are today. So that kind of\nmakes every one of us be at it to say,\nhey, there is a possibility and we are\npretty large right now, by the way. So we\ncan grow 50x from where we are right now\nand we can see a path. So we are always\nexcited about a much bigger goal. Now of\ncourse, we have reached a stage where we\nsay, hey, our goal is to you know, create\na company that can be at a global level\nagainst the likes of Google's and\nFacebook's and all of those companies and\nwhy not, why not from here we have a\nchance and opportunity to do it. We will\ntry and make it happen. We may not\nsucceed, but the whole ex the whole idea\nis that the uh that we are aligned on\nthe ambition is very important.\nInherently also, for example, AB and I\nmay not talk for like 2 weeks or\nsomething. He lives in the US or I would\nexactly know what he he's saying or doing\nor thinking. So there is this piece that\njust works together. So what worked? I\nmean uh uh in terms of so that's that's\nlike amazing chemistry and like really\nrare to see uh what what part of it was\ndeliberate and\nmaybe the maybe I'll tell you what some\nthings which you which make you come\ntogether more are when you come out with\nthe low phases of life, right? We have\nhad a lot of low phases in 18 years,\nyou're going to have a lot of low phases,\nright? I'm pretty sure each one of you\nspend about a year here would have had\nfour of them already, right? Four low\nphases already because you know, it is how\nit\n\n\nWorks, right? So, in 18 years, we were. So, the big low moments for us are the ones where we truly came together. Um, and you could see, like, you could see in the eyes of the other on how they're going to make it happen. So, I don't know why it worked. It just seems to work. Like, it's very hard, like, why do marriages exist and survive? I don't know, man. Like, I don't know. They just work for some reason. And if you try to put it in words, it kind of loses the sense of it. It's just you, it's a feeling, it just works.\nYou feel it in your bones. Yeah.\nYeah. But we have that true even at the company level, like, you know, we have had people who are just finishing 17 years. We have, I think, 15 people who are just going to finish 17 years this year, and I'm going to finish 18. Right. So, it's not too bad.\nAmazing. You know, you've built very high talent density teams.\nYeah.\nRight. And, uh, often with high talent density teams is that at times organizations overgrow them, or at times they grow the overgrowth of the organizations. Right. And then, uh, then, of course, there's a parting of ways that often happens. What has enabled, uh, this 10, 15, 17 years kind of, uh, stay with the larger team, right? Because often founders, of course, uh, this is their identity, this is their life's work, but what works for the larger team? Look, I think there are three kinds of people here. Like, one who kind of think, hey, they've done really well, uh, and they, they think they've outgrown the company, they, they leave us. Okay, most of the time they leave us. The really high-quality ones become entrepreneurs. The beauty of becoming entrepreneurs, they're going to fail. That's the probability, right? That's a high probability scenario. There will be successes, like Misho, right? So, he went on to build something, and there'll be, you know, we have like, out of 90 companies that have built out of InMobi, maybe like 20, 30 of them are really successful, but the 60, 70 are not, but that's just probability. So, 50% of those 60, 70 come back. So, that's even better because the, if I had my way, I would hire entrepreneurs, but you know, you can't hire entrepreneurs, you hire entrepreneurs, right? Because you give them investment, so you can get them. I cannot hire entrepreneurs. So, the second, what is second best? Hire failed entrepreneurs. So, we have an open policy to basically hire failed entrepreneurs, like, because you at least had the guts to essentially do something. Life is not about skills, it's not about ability, those are like overrated, commoditized in the world. The only thing that matters is, do you have the ability and the capability and the audacity to go for it? And if you did, and you didn't succeed, but the reason for you to fail are like 500, but the fact that you went for it is what I care for. And so, therefore, like, mid, so many of our people are like the ones who, who failed. That's one bucket. The second bucket is like, they're killing it in there, and they just want bigger and bigger charters. Thankfully, we're growing, so we give them bigger and bigger charters, right? So, they stay back, and that's, that's amazing. Uh, third is they just...\nOh, well, they're part of the broader family, and I'm okay with it. They all, we all, you know, we all have an InMobi mafia. They keep, keep coming to the office. We all keep hanging out. So, it's not a bad place. You know, they give us business, you know, whatever. We just, we just have, like, we, you know, in the, in the traditional way of, we, we like to believe ourselves as like an Indian multinational. We dislike being like American multinational. We think our own fundamental culture of being able to have it as a family and then also compete and create something is unique, and we think we are going to make that happen because that's how our culture essentially gets defined. Uh, and therefore, when somebody leaves us, it's not as if like we're upset with them leaving us. It's just, you know, it's part of the life, and you know, if you can come back, please do. If you can't, no issues.\nGot that. Now, you made an interesting point out there, and you know, this Reed Hastings of, uh, has talked a lot about it, and and refers to this book called \"Culture Map,\" right? Which is about building global teams outside. If you're a US entrepreneur, how do you build global teams and how do you develop that sensitivity? I don't think enough of that has been done, uh, from the Indian context, and since you've built global teams, right? And and I like your point that we're building it with unique Indian ethos, right?\nIndian multinational, yeah.\nYeah, and Indian multinational.\nWhat has been your, uh, I would say, a personal culture map on this, right? Or what has been your guiding principle on this?\nYou know, it's, it's what it was on day zero, it is the same thing as today. It's, uh, we like ambitious people, we like people who are entrepreneurial, we like people who, like, can make things uncomfortable, right? Make it uncomfortable because of what you're really pushing for, like, think really, really big, like those people, not that somebody else may not, like, I think everybody in the world likes these kind of people, right? It's very hard. So, but how do we support it is, we support this by saying we can deal with failures, and that's the big part that we do decently well. We deal with failures pretty okay. Like, if people try and do something and they fail, they get a promotion. They may get a promotion, right? So, it's like, it's, it's some of those things we try to do. We truly value trust and, uh, and, and we truly value people who spend long. Nobody can build a big thing in life if you're basically spending two years. Nobody builds anything in two years. So, there are a lot of these people and resumes and CVs that you see who do two years, two years, two years, two years, basically, they should just, like, after five such stints, they should not be hired anywhere because they are absolutely useless people, right? But so, we really value people and try and give them compounding outcomes if you spend more and more time. Of course, you got to be good. Um, so that's those are things we clearly value. Uh, and we do this globally also, right? So, we try to get them, it becomes harder. It's easier to attract people in your own community, in your own society, in your own where the connect is a little deep, more deeper, but yeah, we try to do this even globally, and we built some amazing global teams because if we, you know, we have 20 plus offices globally right now, to try and build like a Japanese team, you can't send Indians out there, or a Chinese team, etc. So, I think we've been able to stay very true to our culture. That culture is such that it attracts few people and detracts few people, and we are okay with that. We are not trying to be one for everybody, like, we don't, and we are okay in alienating people, but truly okay in accepting few people in the, in the company.\nLet's change tracks a little here, right? Um, and let's talk about finding, uh, finding what they say, the product market fit, right? And I, uh, I wanted to actually ask that earlier, but I think conversation moved in a very interesting direction and did want to pursue that thread. Um, I think at InMobi, uh, especially as you were, uh, coming after M-Coach, which was a high conviction decision. Talk to us about finding, uh, there's again a thread that you started pulling on. Talk to us about discovering the PMF there, right? And of course, then, uh, there are a lot of interesting headwinds, uh, that came into that business, and, uh, how did you navigate that, and then, uh, in your perspective, what were, what are maybe one or two decisions that actually made all the difference in this journey?\nThe, the PMF for us, look, there, you're building an enterprise product, enterprise software, right? So, in the first phase, PMF was to the belief on, uh, a mobile ecosystem taking off, and I remember going to, um, every venture capitalist in India, everybody said no to us, like, literally everybody. And this, their argument was one, which is to say, you're amazing thing, but...\nBut...\nInternet on mobile is not a reality. You are so off. So, now when you hear this like 40 times, please remember I heard this earlier and I'd given up once. So, now when I heard this, I was like, okay, to hell with you. So, I went to the US. So, there the argument was, the idea is amazing, but you seem to be doing this in India, that is a land of, uh, you know, services. It's not a land for you to build a product. The bet on the construct was, I think when we saw in the US that there is a, there the formation of this is going to be real. We didn't know whether a product would work or not. So, I think the point I want to make is, we didn't know whether the product would work or not. We knew that this was needed. That became clear to us. Now, it boiled down to us, like, either screwing up on the product or screwing up on our execution, but we knew the industry will exist for sure. Uh, the big change, by the way, for us was, there were a bunch of other companies who also thought about this, uh, in India, in Asia. The big difference for us, we went actually and said we will build it globally. The thing that became clear to us was the effort required to build for a small market like India, or the effort required to build for a global market, the delta between the two is very small. So, we at the, at, I think, at Series A itself, we said we will build a global company. It just looks the same to me, and the reason why that's a big decision is because it's not been done before. So, we had a conviction on trying to do this. Even today, most of the companies, uh, in India will suffer, by the way. So, as you guys think about building stuff, you will suffer because you don't have, you can't make money on a per-unit basis here. It's very, very hard, uh, unless you truly solve something. I don't know what, but something, uh, it's hard, but if your software is good, if your idea is good, then you should take it global. All of the companies in our space died who, who focused only on Asia.\nYeah, and I remember that, uh, especially in 2010, 2011, there were like a bunch of them, and all of them are trophied slowly.\nYou know, in your journey, 18 years, right? You, you talked about the, the sinusoidal curve that, uh, an entrepreneur goes through. Talk to us about the most, uh, difficult moment, uh, during this, uh, wherein, and, uh, how did you navigate it?\nThere was a phase for InMobi that was very difficult. The phase, uh, was right, 2015 and 2016, that those two years were most difficult for us. It's very documented, actually. Those two years are very, a lot of people have asked me this question, and they, they were difficult because I launched very similar to Glance, I launched a platform called Meep, you know, and so it was like minus one to zero. The thing that happened as a result of that was, I realized I, we should not rely on others because investing and investors, you know, they are momentum investors, like, nobody's going to come you and neither would I, by the way. Hey, I am failing. Save me. That's not a good use of my money, right? The better use of my money is, I am flourishing. Please invest behind me. That's a good use of my money. So, I realized nobody's going to come and save you ever in life. Nobody. You're on your own. Completely on your own. So, therefore, from that point onwards, we never been, we always made money. We may have made less money in times, you know, if the always made money. The interesting part about that has been that fact that we made money allowed us to be very, very bold, and we made changes, we brought about new things, and we could do it. Part of the reason I say this is because I think there is, you know, there is a euphoria of capital raising and that, you know, may not be the best thing to do, uh, all the time. Once you kind of get to a PMF and some unit economics, try and make it on your own, it's an amazing place to be at.\nNo, amazing. I think a team that pulls through something like this, and you've gone through the trenches together, I think is a team that kind of stays together through a lot of other stuff. And I think that, uh, that also partially explains, uh, the long tenure of people out there.\nOur lowest attrition was 2016. History of the company, 18 years history of the company, lowest attrition 2016. I reduced the pay. I reduced the pay, yet nobody left. People work for mission, and we tend to forget as you scale a little bit, like all of you are here, but you know, you're here because there is a mission. So, you got to believe that everybody else will also stay for that mission. So, it's hard to keep the mission alive, and of course, like all of those things, but if there is a way to do it, people, good people would come in and work for you.\nNo, amazing.\nI think mission is essentially a sales job at some level. Yeah. And I often joke that all founders are salespeople, right? They're selling to customers, investors, employees, family members, friends, and most...\nYourself. Yeah.\nDifficult one, yourself, right?\nSo, yourself, your own snake oil.\nYeah. You know, and, and that's the most...\nGod, I'm good. The company's amazing. Don't give up. Don't give up.\nYeah.\nAnd that's the most difficult sell at times. So, uh, what would be interesting to understand is, um, how do you personally stay motivated, right? And what has been your, uh, how have you kept yourself centered over the years, right? And what has been that, if you will, you go to the gym to stay fit, and, uh, what is the muscle that you exercise for this one?\nI think you assumed that I'm centered, firstly. I think that may not...\nYou know, again, you have mentioned this in some other, uh, interview out there. So,\nOh, god.\nWell, I, I don't know what that, what keeps... Look, you know, I am going to run the company till I can. I'm not going to not run the company. Uh, I love what I do. I absolutely love what I do. Um, there is nothing better than creation. It's so stimulating. It is so amazing to create. It is so hard to create. It's so painful and so hard to create. I think I'm just wired for pain. I love pain. Firstly, I can deal with a lot of pain. All right, so that's one. Like, I just don't, I, I just deal with a lot of pain and I can. So, I think one is, like, people who have an insane ability to deal with pain is really important. Okay, that's one. Second, while dealing with pain, I can, like, think really big. When I'm in more pain, I think bigger. So, I love the discomfort that I get put into for whatever be the reason that I actually don't want to be in. But I am thankful at times I get put into these situations where I am in pain and I think much bigger. We have figured out our boldest bets at all points of life. If I look historically, our boldest bets have come in when I'm in a corner. You know, it's...\n\n\nLike, you know, you put a fire in this building, we'll all figure out how to get out of it. If you basically tell us to get out of it right now, we would actually end up fighting, right? Like, run over each other or something. We all do amazing things when you are in a corner or when you are in that situation.\nI enjoy pain. I enjoy creation. I enjoy disrupting things. And but in all of this, the thing that I truly enjoy is making something really big. Uh, as long as I can do this, I don't know what else to do. I, I don't know anything else to do also. I don't think I'll get employed easily, but I, you know, I just enjoy this. But I think as entrepreneurs, a bunch of you are hopefully, um, yeah, you should, you would learn, if not already, I'm sure a lot of you are already learning pain.\nUm, how you come out of it is during the pain period, it's very important.\nYeah.\nYeah, your scars make you, uh, but I think just being creating something big, right? You know, there's this folklore around Glance that it was a weekend hack and then it became something. Talk to us about that, right? And what I'm like personally curious on that one is that when you're already running a ship that seems to be going somewhere, at times you, some of the weekend hacks or some of these interesting things that come by you, there's a possibility that these things might just get ignored. Right? Uh, why did it not get ignored in the first place as well?\nYeah, look, I don't know. I think I must have ignored five others that I don't even know about that could have become big. So, it's very hard to know what you like missed out on. I, uh, yes, you're right. Look, it was a, it was a very small team hacking on the side. They showed something and, um, yeah, it's huge today. Why did we not give up on it? I have no clue. Look, it's so hard to say because, look, we, we are, by the way, as a company, we're always in this minus 1 to 0 phase for something. So, like, you know, in movies, the ad business is really big. Glance is becoming very large. We have four things happening in the company which are minus 1 to zero, which is just like, you know, it's just exciting.\nWhy? Because now we know that the next thing that will come in, it's, it's to me, if you ask me, that is the true reason why you're a startup. The startup is not a function of the amount of money or the lack of money. Right? Typically, you assume startups are the ones that don't have money. Well, that's not a good explanation. It's a state of mind. Our state of mind in the company is that we will have minus one to zero. Just that, R minus 1 to 0 now, like, is, you know, hey, can this be a 1 to 5 billion opportunity? And if yes, can you, can three of you work on it? Right? So I think it's a state, partly, um,\nI don't know if there is a perfect answer to this, but, uh, yeah, it's, it, it is a lot of fun. It keeps the company very young also, by the way. It's always like, there's always some kind of a discomfort in the company. Oh, God, what's happening, happening? Why is this happening? Is this really the right thing to get focused? Like, people ask this question around focus, right? I dislike it. I think we're so wired to actually be able to do multiple things that we should do it. You know, we do few things at the same point of time and figure it out.\nUh, I have one last question, uh, and then we'll turn it over to the audience.\nOkay.\nUh, you know, you mentioned about a spirituality, meditation, uh, in like a bunch of conversation, which is the reason why I ended up asking about centered peace, right? And, uh,\noh yeah, I do stuff, yeah.\nYeah.\nYou should have told me you wanted me to take that way. Okay, I would have told you, yeah.\nYeah, and you've talked about J. Krishna Morti's influencing thought process as well, right? Tell me, uh, one part of this, uh, journey that all of us are on as founders is this, um, journey of constant hustle and navigating through this entire chaos, right? And, uh, how does it go hand in hand with being mindful, centered, right?\nI think it goes completely hand to hand. I think the, you know, what you really desire and have ambition for and what your purpose is, you got to be able to get there without getting distracted. Okay, a lot of these practices, and you can choose your own practice, and maybe you're evolved enough, you don't need practice, right? So, like, whether it is meditation, whether it is like yoga, whether it's a bunch of these things, they allow you to essentially be, you know, be okay with your own skin, right? Be okay with who you are. Like, you know, I, I, I know I'm not good at so many things. I just don't want to be good at them anymore. Earlier, I try to hide them. Now, I, I'm absolutely okay. It's like, I'm not good at this. But you're okay with this, right? You people will come and tell me, here is your weakness in the company. I'll be like, \"Oh, let me go fix it.\" That's distraction. Okay, fine. It's not good. Like, that's fine. Move on. Right. I think being centered is being okay with your weaknesses, being okay with what you're not good at. Also, at the same time, have higher conviction on what you really think is good. I think some of these practices have allowed that thing to like noise to not creep in. Uh, yet it's not true all the time, like, of course, we are all humans and we kind of, you know, and then we come back to the unstable equilibrium of being centered at times.\nYeah.\nAwesome. Great. Thanks. Thanks, Naveen. I, we'll turn this over to the audience for questions.\nSure.\nSo I actually share a history with Glance.\nOh.\nSo basically, back in 2019, I founded a platform called Playmon. We are the competitors of gaming play monk.\nSo we are competitors of gaming monk. So we were doing good, but we overbuilt a lot of things.\nOverbuilt?\nYeah. As in, like, have a lot of features, n number of features. Why have it? We don't know. We didn't raise MVP. We didn't have anything. So we just go, went on, built a lot of things, right? Uh, then eventually, Glance acquired, uh, gaming monk. And then we thought of, we'll fight in for it. Uh, go against Glance, build features. We actually built features which games that work on lock screen. We also built it. But then we figured, like, come on here. However much we are, like, not funded, we don't have a background. We might probably get crushed instantly by the time we launch. So we gave up. Uh, when you said about convincing and giving up, it was so relatable. I gave up on you. So to compete against you. So yeah, to compete against you, I gave up. So I can't do that. So I'm listening that from you now here. So then moving on. Yeah. Nice question.\nYeah. Technically, then I love it.\nYeah. Then I moved to the other side. I went to the VC. made you feel on the, like, the dark side of life or something, like you are the predator who's like, the question is basically, uh, how do you find, like, not to, not to overbuild when you're doing in minus one to zero, you end up overbuilding because you want to convince the VCs, or you build up, you know, having just the core features, which again, the VC say, it's an amazing product, we don't want to invest in you. So how do you find the balance? That's the question.\nYeah, look, it's hard. We, we don't know. We go less to VCs now, so that's fine. We, we build it for ourselves. But I think the question remains because you, you go to the customers, like, so how do you, how do you say, hey, what we got is enough? But here is another way to think about this. Um, if what you got is not enough, then what you got is not good, then don't raise the money. It's just not good, right? So there is a core product and then there are these bells and whistles around it, right? If you're telling me you have a bunch of bells and whistles and no core product, that's an issue in itself. But if your core construct and concept is not understood by the venture capitalist or any anybody, then you can build as many of these as you want. There is something wrong with the core.\nThe question is, like, what if it's like in a crowded space, as in, like, there are a lot of competitors into the same space?\nI wouldn't then be in that space.\nWhy would you want to be in that space when it's too crowded? Because you, you know, you guys don't reduce your chances of success. You don't have capital. You're not sitting there with, like, oh, I have $100 million to burn or something like that, right? It should not be like, we should be really smart, like, taking off from minus 1 to zero and zero to one. You got to be shrewd. You got to be smart. You got to go figure out that angle through which you can just come out, like, it's not a mortality rate is so high in zero to one, right? Or till you get to this, like, it's, it's 99 some percent, right? So just get there and then you are in somewhat of a rarified air, like, so don't, like, if you start in a, like, if somebody comes and tells me, like, we're building one more whatever, something in fintech or something exactly same, like, no, nobody's going to put money behind it. It's hard.\nAs founders, the only finite thing that you have is, uh, time, energy, and resilience, and you have to choose very, uh, very carefully where you choose to spend it, right? So yeah, I completely go with that.\nWanted to ask something about your early, early personal life. So I, Kpur, then you did McKinsey and then went for your MBA, HBS. So, uh, how do you reflect back on that journey? How does that, you know, help or otherwise in your startup journey? Yeah, look, I think, uh, there are two things that, look, I come from middle class, you know, Kpur. Um, I always thought about growing up in the '80s and the '90s, mostly in the '90s, to say, look, life is all about safety. Uh, it's like, hey, I must get all the pedigrees, which I was getting, right? You add more pedigree, that's your success, right? So, you like, we, we were all catering to, like, a world of safety, a world of, um, a lot of, um, you know, brands. Then I went to HBS, which was most amazing for me. So, when I reached there, I saw the best guys were, like, always, like, quiet and sitting in a corner and, like, thinking about building something. And I was like, what is this thing, you building something? What does that mean? Like, what does that mean? And I, and to me, for a middle class boy to be able to dream big, hit there that I am allowed to dream big, and there were no, you know, a lot of this has to do with, you know, having heroes around yourself. In India, there were no such heroes at that point of time, so it was so hard to relate, like, it was so hard for me to relate to Naran Morti, right? Like, he's, he's such a different era, and, you know, of course, I, I can't relate to, you know, J. Tata or to, uh, you know, choose your pick. I can't relate to them. I don't know their stories. They didn't seem like me. But when I went there, I saw they were like me and they could do it. So, two things hit me in that era. One, the audacity and the ability to think so insane that it is discomforting and almost sounding ridiculous for people, and the ability for a middle-class normal boy to be able to think and go for things that, like, normally you would not, are two things that happened. So I did give up my any possibility of a job and everything, and it was very painful after that, but yeah, that was two things. Yeah.\nWhat is the mental model that you use to basically validate your idea? The ones that I've come across are basically not extrapolating your problems or your vision into the broader public. Say you have a problem. Don't assume that everyone does and not being so mesmerized by a solution that you go around finding a problem. What are your mental models that you, you know, use to validate your ideas, your thoughts, your propositions?\nCurrently or earlier?\nUh, currently, I think it would be a lot different because when you're coming from an established base, uh, you have a lot of things figured out. You know the industry. Uh, but I'd say, like, earlier, say back when you were in 2005, it's not, it's not that different, but look at that point of time, I just wanted to get to a stage from minus 1 to zero where I have something that works for me. Uh, I, or get to at best one, like, that was, that was it. I just didn't want to die, like, I was doing everything and anything to, like, not get eradicated. So the idea was to move so swiftly and so fast and so quickly and to figure out something somewhere that I am just moving very fast. So that was, so there was no, like, deeper thought than that. It was just like, not to, not to, okay, if I can slightly rephrase, if you are toggling between four to five ideas, um, and you have to say dedicate your time, your resources, your effort into one, uh, how, how would you go about that? Would you try your hands at multiple things, then see what fits, or is there something, like, some amount of heuristics that you have to say that, okay, you know, this works, or some kind of a test that would help you figure that out?\nYeah, that's an easier one for me to answer. I'll tell you why. So the way I think about these things is everything is equally hard or very hard, let's say that way, right? Whether you, like, how do you get to that stage of, like, minus 1 to 0, 0 to 1, like, whatever it is, so hard, it doesn't really matter. Like, I could try and open a shop down the road and that could fail in itself, right? It's just very, very painful and hard. So the way I think about this is, if I anyway, I'm going to go through this excruciating pain, so much of it, and my probability of not surviving is very high, then what is the one where I have, I can, I am I aiming in some space so big that everybody else in their normal senses would think it's stupid? So I, I, I like ideas and I go after them if others come and tell me that it's stupid. It's insane. It'll never, you'll never be able to pull it off because you're like, I think he was saying, like, it was overcrowded. I don't want to be in anything which is overcrowded. I just want to be in a place where nobody's going after it. So when, and by the way, that framework remains true till today because, for example, we did Glance AI. The idea was to say, hey, let's build a platform that can, like, disrupt commerce, period, like, worldwide, will change commerce and shopping, that's it. And, uh, we'll, we'll go and here are the 10 things to be done, you know, to go for it. So that's the framework I would use. If I succeed, then you know, succeed really big, and that was the thing within InMobi also when,\n\n\nWe started the advertising space. We knew Google was there, not today, but it is going to enter this space. And when everybody said, \"Don't do global,\" we said, \"We're going to do global.\" If I succeed, like, we'll really win big. So I think outcome for me is always, I say, is the idea that what you're going after is so big that if you were to succeed on a very low probability, you know you're doing well.\n\nSo, as you said that you have got a lot, a lot of minus one to nothing in your life. So how would a founder think, okay, if I try out something, let's say really big, or something of his conviction, and he goes to nothing, then what's next? How should they have that mindset that you know how to survive this and you know try out again, or what should they do next in that way?\n\nYeah, look, I think one of the, one of the core skills that you came in with, why you're even doing this right now, is that you can, you can suffer pain. So just keep suffering. Like, like you, there's nothing else to it. You're going to just like restart and suffer again. Like, it's your ability to suffer, like, keep taking pain. Maybe it's two years, maybe it's four years, who knows, but just be at it. Like the probability of a success, it's, it's a game of, like, it's poker, right? Or whatever, Texas Hold'em, whatever that is. You, you're just going to win eventually, but you got to be, you got to stay at it. Like the whole process is about elimination. So they're just trying to eliminate you, not they, meaning the system is just trying to eliminate you. Just say, \"Oh, there's so much pain. Go away.\" So if you don't go away, well, you'll succeed, like, unless you're like either extremely unlucky or like miraculously dumb or something, like you will, you will do fine. Like, you just stay at it.\n\nI'm just talking about financial upside. You know, when you try, you drain a lot of...\n\nYeah. So if the argument starts with financial upside, then there is just, it's, you lost it to begin with. You lost it to begin with. Like, if anybody sits there and says, \"Here is my, here is my loss because of I'm not in the market, and here's the what I'm facing,\" oh, you, you lost it to begin with. You're not, you're never going to make it because you're always worried about what you're losing. You're not thinking about what you're going to make, not as money, as impact. Uh, and if the, if what you're losing is important to you, then you're actually struggling quite badly out there. Uh, and we have had so many people who basically create spreadsheets and think about their cash flows and then say, \"I'm dropping this, but you know, valuation needs to be this much,\" or whatever. I, you know, those things, you can never, it's an unpredictable process of excruciating pain of basically going through this. You may not succeed.\n\nJust curious, uh, in our times, uh, the Google trends for purpose of life spiked up. There are a lot of people searching about purpose of life, right? Uh, which I have a lot of time, man.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nThey have a lot of time.\n\nI mean, it's, it's a thing, you know. Uh, they are the new people who are discouraging you, by the way.\n\nUh, I mean, like travel, like my purpose of life is to travel or something like that. It's weird, but, uh, have you ever had moments in your journey of building InMobi, right at the start, most, more, more so, where you've gotten like really comfortable and you've probably seen time pass by and regret it later? Has it ever happened to you? Time pass by, maybe a couple of months and regret it later? Have you ever had that, or you know, are you also, you know, the hungry kind who breaks it and makes it, you know, it's like something like that?\n\nWow. I want to believe I'm, I, I don't slack around. I, those things don't bother me. Like, I think I know the purpose of my life, meaning I am always on. But I think I'll tell you with a different point here. You know, you're, you can only be always on if this is the best thing in your life. You cannot be always on, like, if anyone of you sits there and tells me, \"Oh, I have worked so hard in building my startup. Let me go take a vacation.\" You should quit, like, quit immediately because you're not built for this. If anyone of you sits there and say, \"Okay, I, you know, I, I'm having, you know, work-life balance issues,\" should quit immediately. Like these thoughts in itself are like, I don't know, parasitic or something, whatever, but like, they're just wrong.\n\nNo, but I, I, I, I don't think of it this way, actually, to say, \"Are you always on?\" I just like, you know, as a child, when I used to, I always used to look forward to the 4:00 p.m. time because I would go play cricket, right? And I wouldn't know, the only reason to get back home would be because the sun's gone down and you can't play anymore. But those two and a half hours would, you would never know where they went because they were the best moments of my, of my day. And that is what this is. These are the, be, this is like the 16 hours that I work or whatever that number is. It's the best moment of my, like, day, and every day it is the best moment of my day. Uh, and, and therefore, you, you can't, I can't tell people to say, \"Oh, you should work harder,\" like, it comes from within, like, if you do, then you do, if you don't, then you don't. And you know, you can't, you can make people work for eight hours, after that is something else, right? Then, and that's pretty much what, what it is.\n\nIt was beautiful about you talking about pain and then citing the fact that it is during those low moments of pain that you figured out that you're going to think insanely big and again dig yourself out of that hole. Um, and I'm being very specific here because we've done this together. Meep was painful. It was painful for all of us. What happened after that? I, I, I transitioned out, so I didn't actually get to be part of the team then. So let me give you a slightly different analogy, like, so there is a, you know, let's say you play cricket, right? And you kind of, you lose like five wickets, or you know, whatever, like, and you're like down to like last pair of bats, true batsmen, right, who can play going forward, and you have a uphill task, uphill task to go do something. The traditional Indian cricket team would actually kind of, you know, be safe and kind of play it out and go slow and kind of make some runs and, you know, lose less badly.\n\nThe new, the new era of cricket team, what they do is to say, \"Hell with you. I'm going to just like go for a completely radical strategy of batting in a way that you would just get, you know, you'll be caught off guard and you know, and I'm hopefully I'm going to win.\" The point I'm making is when you are really down and low, there are two strategies you can have. One is to say, \"Oh, let me like curb down. I don't think I'm built for this. Let me kind of make little, little, little, little incremental things.\" That is to say, what worse can happen? Like, I can lose the cricket match by a lot of runs, by less runs, I'm still going to lose the cricket match. So that's true in those strategies. Like, if I, when I screwed it up a few of those times, it's like, anyway screwed up, so you go for it. So the answer in those situations is, if you truly want to come out of it, then you kind of bulk yourself down and say, \"Okay, what's the best thing I can do? Nobody expects you to do it.\" It's that whole probability of like, everybody's expecting you to do like the, the, the, the obvious. The game is all about not doing the obvious. And it's not a game that is played, the game of not playing the obvious is not a game that is just played by like startup guys. It is even played by the most successful business houses. But you got to play that game at that moment when you could clearly see it's not going to work out. Now, in your world, which is minus one to zero, it is exactly the same. No investor is actually going to be excited about you. By the way, you don't need 100 investors. So it's not like a, it's not like you need a societal approval of the venture community that you're a good person. You need that one bloody guy. So go for it. You just need to care for that one guy who buys into your narrative. Hopefully, 99 others say you're bad, but you don't care. Go for that one guy. Maybe he'll buy into your story. But the only reason when he buys into your story is like, it is so insane. It is so out there that nobody really believes it. But you know it may work out. I think going for the non-obvious and going after what you call heretical at from today's perspective are the two biggest upsides available to us as founders. So thanks for sharing that. Uh, I know that people have more questions. I actually have more questions in my sheet as well.\n\nDinner.\n\n100%. Yeah, we'll do that nonetheless. Free dinner is equally important at this stage also.\n\nSome habits don't die. You always want free food. Thanks for doing this. It's been a pleasure, uh, having you here and, uh, talking to you today. Thanks for doing this and, uh, thanks for um, sharing your uh, journey and uh, and uh, yeah, absolutely pleasure having you. Thank you.\n\nThank you. Thank you for inviting. Great work.\n\nThat was another episode of Minus One from the team at South Park Commons.
