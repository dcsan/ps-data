  "cleanText": "You're now plugged in to the Delphi podcast.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome back to the Delphi podcast.\nI'm John, a ventures associate here at Delphi Ventures.\nToday we're digging into one of the most ambitious real-world applications of DePIN to date.\nI'm joined by Harry Dewhirst, co-founder and CEO of 375ai, a company building a decentralized network of sensors to capture and monetize real-world physical data at scale.\nThink traffic flows, vehicles, weather conditions, and a lot more.\nAll captured directly from billboards and storefronts, processed by AI at the edge, and powered by onchain token incentives.\nDelphi Ventures is proud to be participating in 375's upcoming fundraising round and to be working together with Harry and the team on this to scale the network.\nHarry, it's awesome to have you.\nLet's get into it.\nPleasure to be here.\nThanks.\nSo before we dive into the story of 375, I'd like to kind of hear your background.\nI know you have a very impressive run both in Web2 and Web3, especially when it comes to monetizing data.\nAnd so why don't you share some of your insights and experiences that kind of led you to build 375?\nSure.\nSo I've been an entrepreneur most of my, well, my whole career really.\nI started a company when I was in my 20s and that was a business that was helping mobile operators monetize their users information more specifically.\nSo we raised investment from some leading venture firms in the valley, Sequoia, Excel, as well as strategic investors like Vodafone and Telefonica, and we built a platform that enabled them to make sense and understand who their customers were, but then of course be able to target and profile them for paying customers such as brands and advertisers.\nWe ultimately sold that business to Singtel, the large mobile operating holding company in Singapore that have operations across Southeast Asia, Australia, India.\nAnd I moved out to Singapore and then built this data business inside of Singtel for monetizing and profiling and targeting their consumer base or their subscriber base.\nI then went on to be president at another data business called Bliss, which was using mobile phones as a way to understand people's movement in the real world.\nSo apps, by this time, you know, my first business was started before iPhone and Android even existed.\nBy this point in time, you know, apps were prevalent and phones had GPS and things like that.\nSo there were lots of more data points made available, and this Bliss was a platform that took in huge amounts of data about where devices went and could use that as a sample to understand the general movement of people in the real world, and that was very, very valuable to retailers, to quick-service restaurants, to luxury brands, hotels, and so on.\nWe ultimately sold that business to private equity and then it ultimately sold to T-Mobile in the US.\nMy last feray before starting 375ai was I was appointed CEO of Lynxys, the Wi-Fi router company that most people over 35 have had one in their home at some point.\nAnd that was a different experience for me outside of my entrepreneurial roots, but approached it in the same vein nonetheless.\nWe were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raised $160 million to take it private, and reinvent the business, and it was there that I stumbled across projects like Helium that just fascinated me.\nAnd this is three, four years ago.\nIt's fascinated me and now my co-founder Rob so much that we left Lynxys to launch 375, and that's yeah, just coming up to almost three years ago to the day.\nVery cool.\nWere you always interested in crypto?\nLike, you were the CEO of Lynxys and then you identified Helium.\nSo I was kind of curious.\nYeah, I had, I didn't have any professional exposure to crypto, but I was holding crypto probably since 2015, 16.\nSo, but as a retail investor.\nAnd I did have friends that had moved into working in the crypto space as their career.\nSo I did, you know, tag along often and particularly as my interest in, in, you know, DY at the time, now kind of more broadly known as DePIN, grew, I, you know, I would go to all the conferences and so on and and had a fair number of friendly faces to see thanks to people who are friends who had moved into the industry.\nBut no, prior to 375, my interest in crypto was really as a, you know, a retail investor.\nI rode some of the waves.\nI distinctly remember being stuck in barley in a volcano with Bitcoin going to 20K, which was very exciting.\nI don't know what year, what cycle that was, but I remember being very excited stuck on an island in the Southeast Asia.\nInteresting.\nVery cool.\nSo, so at one point 375, you know, you were deploying other people's DePIN devices and then you kind of made a hard pivot and decided to build your own network, own devices, own token.\nWhat was the light bulb moment for you to make that switch?\nYeah, so you're absolutely right.\nWe started the business with an intention of being, you know, an enterprise or the biggest enterprise-grade deployer of other people's DePIN stuff, which we achieved, and we became one of the larger miners of various different projects in the space, Helium, Xnet, and a handful of others.\nIt was during that time that we learned obviously a lot about what we like about certain projects, what we don't.\nWhether that's the tokenomics, whether that's kind of the concepts, whether it's the demand side, whether it's the business model.\nSo what we decided was that we were sitting on an exclusive contract that was very valuable then and remains very valuable to this day, which was a real estate relationship to give us access to 50,000 very sought-after unique locations on billboards with a publicly traded company called Outfront.\nWe decided that that asset was really underleveraged.\nAnd whilst we were deploying other gear there and monetizing it, we thought that there was a bigger opportunity.\nSo we kind of went to the drawing board and said, \"Okay, like if we were to build our own project, what pieces would we take from all of these experiences that we've had with all of these other projects, what kind of pitfalls would we look to try and avoid?\"\nAnd that's really where the kind of ideation for what is now 375 and the data intelligence network started.\nPlus, of course, my background and experience in data, it was an obvious path to take, you know, using the latest and greatest technology to attack real-world data in a new and novel way.\nGot it.\nOkay.\nSo before we go deeper into mechanics, could you give us maybe a basic overview of 375 AI right now, like what, what, what actually you're tracking, what type of real-world data we're talking about, and what are the node types?\nYeah, sure.\nSo 375 is an edge data intelligence network.\nWe've deployed and developed advanced sensors that we've placed across strategic locations across the US.\nThese devices consist of an Nvidia GPU core which runs its own LLM, its own computer vision software, and is something that we train to our specification.\nInto that is a multitude of sensors.\nThe primary, the primary and the most expensive or valuable sensors being six very specialized cameras.\nAnd then a host of other kind of smaller sensors, microphones, atmospheric, environmental, and so on.\nThat data gets fed into the core and as much information as the model is trained to do so is extracted from it.\nSo our initial focus has been on vehicular data because of the placements being on some of the busiest highways in the country.\nYou know, think eight lanes of traffic going two directions at 80 mph, capturing everything from capturing and identifying everything from make, model, color, number of occupants in the car, license plates, incidents on the road, whether that's collisions, erratic driving, ambulances, tow trucks, and then when it comes to commercial vehicles, capturing every characteristic of that commercial vehicle, whether that's the US Department of Transport number, whether it's a trailer ID, from containers, what the carrier is.\nSo, is it a Hapag Lloyd trailer?\nIs it an Evergreen trailer?\nIs it a UPS truck, a FedEx truck, or any other independent email address or phone number that we're able to pull off of these moving vehicles as commercial vehicles are a particularly interesting category as we come on to, you know, why is this data valuable and what's it for?\nOkay.\nAnd you know, I mean, everybody talks about like real-world data being inherently useful and valuable, but it can also be quite noisy, right?\nLike it can be messy, unstructured.\nWhat makes the data that you're tracking actually useful for businesses and make them willing to pay for it?\nSure.\nI mean, of course, there's no, it's no surprise to anyone that there's, you know, there's millions and millions of cameras out there in theory capturing this information, but it isn't data.\nIt's just video.\nAnd what our system is doing is taking these six high-definition specialized streams of video and on the fly and at the edge in real time converting that into data in anonymized format in a very privacy-compliant and respectful way because the video itself never leaves the device.\nSo there is no privacy concern or regulation to be abided by because the video is neither stored nor used.\nThe AI scans it, extracts the information it needs, and then expunges it.\nThat's never to our knowledge been done at least at this scale before.\nAnd as we roll out more and more cameras and more and more devices, and we'll come on to a smaller form factor device that we've been working on, but it, you know, it's normalizing that unstructured data into something that is usable, and and of course once it's into a usable format, you can combine it with other forms of data.\nAnd then you're off to the races.\nAnd really this is the first time deterministic data about what's going on on the corner of Broadway and Howard in New York has ever been possible.\nAnd that's thanks to the advent and development in technology.\nSo, could you maybe give a concrete, like, some concrete examples of what type of data could be used for what type of application?\nI mean, you know, one example that comes to mind is, you know, hedge funds and traders have been, you know, it's known that they've been tracking, you know, satellite and drone imagery, right, to gain an edge in all sorts of like clever ways, you know, they've been like maybe like monitor a parking lot to have a sense of like how a retailer shop is doing or, you know, if there's a natural disaster, they can check for damages in power plants and all sorts of like clever techniques, but I'm kind of curious like what businesses can get out of 375 that they can't through these like alternative means of capturing real-world data.\nYeah.\nSome concrete examples would really help.\nSure.\nSo, let's use that example there of hedge funds and satellite imagery.\nSo the reason they're buying that data is to give them an edge on understanding whether Best Buy's results or Target's results or what Walmart's results are going to be up or down or left or right from forecast, and looking at parking lots and looking at the visitation of parking lots based on satellite imagery.\nThat's a pretty cool way to approach it.\nNow the challenges are those images are only available when the satellite happens to be flying over that particular place.\nThe image is expensive.\nThey're very expensive to book and order those images.\nThey are a snapshot in time and also they don't have really any way to calculate any form of unique because of the vantage point at which they're being viewed is really just counting the total number, not not the unique number on one day versus another day.\nThe difference in fidelity between that and ours.\nSo let's use an example whereby our devices are deployed outside of on the thoroughfare to a Walmart or to a super center and our device is capturing every single vehicle down to a license plate, which is a unique identifier, which therefore can be used to understand both the reach and the frequency accurately because you know, and we've seen this in the data there, our, you know, our first device that we deployed and that was built by our chief AI officer in his garage in Redwood City, California.\nHe has had that device up and running on the on a billboard in on the 101 that we have a truck, a Ford Transit van that we have seen thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times.\nI don't know what this person does, but they drive past back and forth hundreds of times a week.\nAnd that of course in another means would be considered 100 people, but it's in fact not.\nNow that's one extreme example, but by being able to have a very granular and high-fidelity view on the number, the frequency, and then also from the car itself, there is a lot of assumed demography and other attributes that can be understood, you know, is it all Kia Sportage or is it Range Rovers?\nThere's a very different demographic between those two vehicles.\nAnd there are other, you know, is it F-150s, and I love F-150s.\nI have an F-150, so that's not a knock on F-150s, but is it that or is it Teslas?\nYou know, it's it's a different makeup, a different audience.\nAnd that can change during the day.\nThat could change the different hours of the day.\nAnd this is something that's persistently aware of what's going on.\nAnd not only is it understanding what's going on right now, it's storing that data in perpetuity.\nSo with every passing day, the richness of the data set is getting richer and richer because of the historical data that it has, and over time, new and exciting use cases will appear because of that long-term view as to what's been happening in a specific place over long periods of time.\n\n\nGot it.\nSo I'm hearing, you know, high, like basically more accurate data, right? Higher fidelity, real time, and um, just scale and and and cost-efficient way. So definitely strong points. Uh, and then maybe could you touch base on like where what stage you are at right now? Like, um, are you already generating useful data, or do you need to reach a critical mass for this data to become uh useful enough uh for businesses to be willing to pay? You know, the typical criticism in DePIN is that um, I I think uh Helium was the biggest example of this. They went uh super wide, super fast, scaled the supply side, and the thesis was always has always been that, you know, they need to reach a critical mass to for their data to become useful. So I wonder if the same dynamics uh apply here as well.\nYeah, it's it's a good a good point, and it's something that, you know, in that in that evaluation phase when we were looking at what business and project we want to build based on all the experience that we've had with building and being deployers of Helium and others, and and we love all these businesses that have kind of led the way, but there's certainly aspects of of various parts of them that we've wanted to improve in demand. We wanted to build a product that had immediate demand and has had utility without this build it and they will come or or or this super scale requirement, and and and we've been successful in doing so. So, in order to to give us the best chances of of monetizing out the gate, which I'm pleased to say we we are, and we've signed, you know, paying customers even, you know, ahead of our our TGE, which means that upon TGE, we have onchain revenue. We have iron burn of the of of the the token happening um effective immediate, which is something that many other deepening projects have taken many years to to to do. So, but the one of the ways that we ensured that that was the case is by having extremely high-quality locations for install. So that these devices are are expensive and very, very powerful devices. They cost, we we we sell these devices to the community for $50,000. Um, we sold our first 50 units in pre-sold our first 50 units in Q3 of last year, manufactured them through Q4, and began deployment in Q1. Now we decided to have a very geographic focus. So the first 20 or so units were all deployed in the LA County area. Long Beach is the busiest port in America. And as I mentioned before, commercial and freight traffic is is a very um, I guess low-hanging fruit when it comes to monetization, um, because of because it's such a key leading indicator of of business and economic performance. So we we focused on that that geography first, then New York, New Jersey, and then finally uh the last 15 or 20 devices of that initial batch of 50 in in South Florida. And I think we will continue to have that kind of market-by-market approach rather than having um disparate data from 50 different cities across America, um, which would be much, much more challenging to monetize in any meaningful way. Um, so having the densification has meant that in LA, for example, we are seeing millions of cars per day, of which um there's only about 5 and a half, on any average day, there's 5 and a half to six million unique cars a day on the road in all of LA County. So we're seeing double-digit percentage of unique cars in in a in a given day every day. So there is a level of critical mass and scale, even with a small number of devices placed in the right places, that can be attained.\nI see. And okay. So so that's that's quite impressive that that you track so many cars with just 20 units. I'm still kind of curious. Do you think, like, once you reach a critical mass, however you want to define it, you know, you go region by region, but maybe when you reach a certain scale in US, do you think new type of buyers would be interested in that type of data? Like, would that give rise to an emergence of new type of customers?\nYeah. Um, curious to hear your thoughts there.\nYes. So um, as I as I mentioned, there are there are customers that are that are are interested and will value the data already, and if it's, you know, large markets like New York, Los Angeles, Miami, that's sufficient to make a difference to their business, particularly if, you know, there are transport and logistics businesses where they're three of the biggest biggest ports cities in the country. Um, and you know, Long Beach is the the busiest port in the country, and we have devices on every artery coming in and out of that port. So, there isn't a there isn't a container that comes in or out of Long Beach that we don't at some point see. So, that has enabled us to drive that monetization. There will be use cases that maybe do require more national coverage or, you know, have further requirements for data either in a city or in rural areas. Uh, and that's that's why we've developed um a different size form factor um to to if you if you want to think of these these 375 edge devices as the large as the big rocks, we need other data to be the sand that fills in the gaps between the rocks um to create the most comprehensive picture.\nSo I think there are great use cases now, um, with national coverage, there becomes a greater number, and then with the e the elapsing of time, i.e., the data set is, you know, years of data. There's even further use cases that become available because of the nature of cap. You know, if you can if you can fully understand the past, you're better able to predict the future, and and and therefore, if we have a year of data, then trend analysis is is very, very feasible. Um, if you just have a snapshot of a day, there there's really no trend to to be assessed. So, um, it's those three things that I think will drive waves of new adoption, new use cases, some of which we've we've we've um contemplated, others of which, frankly, we anticipate to be surprises to us. Um, particularly as as people as we expose this data in a platform um for people to plug into their apps, to plug into their their their business intelligence models, they will use it in ways that maybe we haven't yet imagined, um, and that's that's I guess the beauty of data.\nSo um, building a platform for others to plug in. So,\num, that kind of makes me wonder and ask what's uh, like, how do you get the you generated the data, how do you get it in front of the buyers, basically, what's kind of your go-to-market strategy? So initially, and this is the way that many other data businesses bring their data to market. There are there are numerous data platforms uh and data marketplaces. Some are, you know, owned by huge companies like Google and Oracle. Um, others are are smaller and independent, and all of them have their own different niches and flavors as to to what makes a client work with them versus another. And businesses, so say you're McDonald's or Coca-Cola or Walmart, you would typically have a preferred data platform. You don't often have many. Um, you wouldn't work with five different data platforms. You'd probably work with one or two, three at most. So once we've integrated and published our data into these platforms, these these customers, these Fortune 500 businesses can start consuming that in an easy manner that that they can they can add that to to their to their suite of information. Um, so we've been busy and will continue to be busy integrating our data into these large data marketplaces, data platforms that enable the existing rails of how these large in you know, Web2 Fortune 500 companies operate. It it it's, you know, it's within their muscle memory, and they they don't have to, there's no real change of behavior. They'd be just replacing data they other otherwise would have previously bought about traffic on the 101 is now being serviced by our data, which isn't um data that was conducted and published by a survey and a rubber strip on the road 5 years ago counting the number of cars or or uh accidents or whatever.\nI see. So um, so you you supply the data to the data marketplace, and then on the other end, you have these Fortune 500 companies consuming it. What's that landscape look like? Is there is there certain verticals where, like, you know, logistics companies plug into a type of, you know, um, one of these marketplaces, and then maybe hedge funds subscribe to another, or is it is it all kind of general purpose, and you don't know how it can be consumed? It it's quite diverse. Um, so so, you know, one one platform, and and the first couple of platforms that we've integrated to have, you know, customers from McDonald's to FedEx for transport and logistics to Citadel on on, you know, financial services side. So, you know, that's one platform with three very different types of customers. So, it's certainly not um, like very kind of categorized into niches. It's um, gen tends to be general. Of course, there are exceptions to that, but um, the larger platforms service many.\nI see. All right. So, I want to um kind of transition into and talk a bit bit some of the tech stack and and your design choices as you built out the the network. So the biggest one, the biggest uh decision uh there is one of the biggest decisions is running AI at the edge versus cloud. I think uh Hivemapper, if I'm correct, they're doing a little bit of both. Uh, but I think the um the heavier lift is on the cloud, whereas you kind of go on the other end of the spectrum and do currently do everything at the edge, and I think there is no logic at the cloud. You can correct me if I'm wrong there.\nYeah. Yeah. Could you could you maybe dive into the thought process there, and was that kind of how that was decided?\nYes. Um, so the the the rationale behind the decision to do edge AI versus centralized or decentralized, but cloud AI was not because it was easier. In fact, it's far, far harder. Um, it would be way easier for us to just deploy relatively cheap cameras in comparison and just push all that data into the cloud and deal with it there. We decided not to have that architecture very intentionally for two reasons. One, efficiency. Streaming uh that that streaming and storing that that kind of quantity of data at that fidelity of of of quality at scale is not uh trivial, and and would, you know, would become ownorous from a cost perspective over time. Um, and and so that was the first one. But the second one, and and and frankly, more importantly, was the the p the evolving privacy landscape. So whilst right now it would be perfectly permissible to, you know, stream data to a cloud, process it, and and extract the data, that's evolving, that's changing, it's it's it's a moving target, and and we also wanted to build something that was best-in-class in terms of um respecting um, you know, capturing the data that's valuable, but not keeping stuff that that isn't useful to us and could be subject to any form of abuse. So if we don't send the data anywhere, there's no ability for it to be intercepted. There's no ability for it to be um, you know, used by any form of bad actor. So keeping the device processed locally at the edge, keeping the data processed locally at the edge has safety features inherently built in, and um, it's a very privacy-first approach. I see. Raw foot footage comes in, is processed by AI chips on the device at the edge, and then out of the box comes D like the the structured data text data, right?\nOkay, yeah, exactly. I see, and then the video is deleted. So, so it it's it's a very best-in-class way of, and plus we can train the model to stop capturing some data, so if a if a regulation changed, or if we wanted to launch in a geography graphy um that had different regulations, the model can simply be trained to not identify or capture that piece of data and and only capture the the pieces that that are compliant. Um, are you are you worried at all that, you know, a trade-off here is that, you know, maybe, like, if you prefer the cloud route, you could, in theory, run, like, a much bigger AI model computer vision model or multimodal LLM, and then maybe process it, like, you know, have maybe a higher quality of intelligence as as an output? Are you worry worried about that at all, or or no?\nUm, so we're getting the best best of both worlds. We are we are using sample sets picked randomly from our fleet of devices that then are put into a multimodal system in the cloud that then is used as as training data to feed back into into the the the boxes at the edge. So, we can't, you know, you're right in saying we can't run the heaviest parameter model at the edge without the device costing $250,000, which which is just unfeasible. But we can leverage the benefits of of some of these super powerful models to to train and improve within the niches that we're interested in. Because to have, you know, billions of parameters that you only are really using a very small subset of for this very, you know, you only need a certain type of tool for this job, and it's a reasonably small number of tools in the grand scheme of things. We're not going to know need to know anything about, like, British history or or or or novels from the 14th century. Yeah. So, um, it's there's a whole host of information that just isn't needed to be residing to identify the stuff that we need to identify.\nOkay. So, intelligence is one part, right? That's the AI chip. The other is the sensors, the eyes and the ears, right? What what you're tracking. And then basically a simple trade-off space there is, like, you can add more sensors, you know, you can track different stuff, and and that would bump up the price of the of the device. And uh, there's kind of a point where where you are comfortable, like, it's not an overkill, but it's it's super useful for all the other all the use cases that that may emerge in the future. So yeah, maybe maybe some light into into that decision as well could could be interesting. Yeah, I mean, we we built the the system in a modular manner. So, um, over time, if it's if if we realize that there's a piece of data or a piece of information that we could capture from an a sensor that isn't included, it's, you know, relatively easy for us to add that in. I mean, the cameras are really the most expensive sensors. Sensors typically are are quite cheap devices, depending on what they are, but cameras being the most expensive type of sensor typically. So, um, you know, we have a modular system that it will enable us to, if there is a demand and a need, upgrade that that box without um without having to start from scratch, right?\nCuz these are specialized cameras, right? The uh captures different stuff came, so they're they have different um kind of apertures and and and purposes on the roadways and different kind of fields of vision. Of course, we're also looking in two directions um because we're looking for license plates on the fronts and backs of of vehicles and and often kind of verify the front and the back in in places where front and back\n\n\nLicense plates exist, but it's often two lanes of traffic in north and south or east and west.\nSo, three are pointed at the, call it the, the, the northbound lane, three appointed at the southbound lane.\nUm, and they're all kind of capturing different parts.\nSome are very, very kind of honed in and specific to the, the, the smaller signifying marks, license plates, logos, text, email addresses, um, stuff that's very kind of close up.\nOthers are, are much further a field that are identifying the make and model of the vehicle and, and the occupants in the vehicle and, and so on.\nSo there, it's, it's not six of the same cameras.\nIt's different cameras doing, you know, programmed and, and tuned to do different things simultaneously and then marry up together, um, that information to say it, it was, you know, we identify the vehicle as, as, you know, 375 ID vehicle 123.\nRight.\nRight.\nThat's, that's been populated by, you know, potentially six cameras or, or three cameras, uh, to, to, to get that full, full view.\nBut, but it's still, it's still car one, two, three.\nIt hasn't been counted three different times.\nIt's just used three different cameras to populate the data, right?\nSo the, um, the other, I guess, trade-off space is, is more in the architecture, right?\nSo we, we talked about the edge device, and those are installed in these like prime location billboards, and, and I, and, and that's more of like a curated way to scale the network, whereas the other form factor that you mentioned earlier is, I believe, a smaller device that you intend for people to self-deploy, and there's always this, this question of like, when people self-deploy things, you know, how do you ensure the quality and, uh, the quality matches, uh, the, um, um, edge devices, right?\nSo, could you maybe speak to that?\nSure.\nSo, so yeah, you're, you're absolutely right.\nWe've been developing and have developed a product that we, we're calling 375 Street.\nUm, think of it as a miniaturized version of 375 Edge.\nSo, it still has Nvidia, um, GPU at the edge, um, albeit, you know, a much, much smaller, uh, chip.\nThe device is, you know, there, no bigger than the kind of shoe box, if, if you like.\nUm, it contains two, two cameras versus six, um, two different types of cameras again for, for those two different varying ways to use them.\nUm, and, and it's designed for self deployment.\nSo people who have, you know, a balcony, a rooftop, a window ledge, a small business that is seeing lots of stuff go by or interesting stuff go by.\nYou know, you might not see lots, but you might see interesting.\nAnd that does, that can often be valuable.\nInteresting could be if you're on the only road in and out of a, of a, of a town and you're going to see every car that comes in and out of that town.\nUm, that could be very, very valuable.\nSo this is designed for people to, to self-deploy.\nUm, it, it's very, very applicable to be placed in the same place.\nSo if you're a Helium deployer and you've placed a Wi-Fi box in a cafe or in a an amusement park, you could easily put one of these devices next to that Helium device.\nAnd you know, Helium is monetizing by providing connectivity to users who are at the amusement park.\nThis device is capturing, capturing, um, data from what's going on at that amusement park.\nAnd, um, you can monetize that location in multiple means, um, and increase the yields as a deployer from a single, you know, place.\nSo, we're, we're excited to be, um, we'll be selling that product later this, this year.\nAnd, um, as I, as I said before, the, the edge devices really with, with just a few thousand, um, spread across the country, there won't be an, much, there'll be very diminishing returns to doing many, many more than that.\nHowever, with 375 Street, the, we could easily sustain tens, if not hundreds of thousands of these devices to really give us an incredibly rich and comprehensive data set of the nation.\nPlus, um, we, of course, have aspirations outside of the US and, and intend to have other geographies where we launch and make this product available for deployers.\nThis is kind of, uh, similar in some sense to what Hivemapper is doing, right?\nThe, the, the street device especially.\nThe, um, the biggest difference is like, for context, Hivemapper, you know, has a network of, uh, people placing dash cams on their vehicles, uh, to, uh, to capture, uh, uh, map data.\nSo, so these nodes are, are constantly moving and recording, whereas, uh, the, the street devices, they would be stationary.\nUm, so what, what does that difference tell in terms of the type of data that, that you can capture and, uh, what type of like insights you can deliver, um, you're a, what, what different type of insights you are able to deliver?\nYeah, I mean, I, I've, of course, been, been a fan of, of Hivemapper and, and, and had their devices since, since kind of they began.\nUm, so I've been following it closely.\nTheir use cases, whilst there is definitely overlap in the data that we, we capture, the use cases are, are very different.\nTheir customers tend to be more on the mapping and autonomous vehicle side of, side of things because they reside within the car.\nHowever, it doesn't give you a, a, a really a, a view into what's going on on a particular road because for it to do so, it would require, you know, it really only knows what's going on in the car that it's being driven in and the car that's directly in front of it.\nAnd it doesn't have much perview beyond, beyond that limitation.\nUm, and therefore to capture how many vehicles are on the 101 right now would require every other car to have a Hivemapper in it, which is not feasible or, or, or reasonable to expect.\nSo, um, it isn't a good proxy for determining the general traffic flows, um, because of, because it's, it's, it's a sample based, it's a sample based system.\nUm, when you deploy a camera of ours, you know, 99% of the time it's going to extract information about every single vehicle, regardless of whether that vehicle has anything running inside it.\nUm, you know, it's not, um, it's not dependent on the vehicle to be, to be running a piece of software or, or an app or so on.\nBut whilst I mention apps, we should definitely talk about about 375 Go whilst, uh, whilst we, um, do it.\nWe're talking about 375 Street.\nYep.\nWould love to hear it.\nUm, so 375 Go is something that we, we launched in testnet, um, in November, December last year.\nUm, at pretty much at the same time we started deploying the, the 375 edge devices.\nUm, this is a way for anyone to get involved in 375 and think of a phone as, as the smallest sensor on our network.\nYou know, phones are very, have, have, you know, they have obviously have cameras, they have microphones, they've got all kinds of other things.\nThey have lidar.\nUm, so there are very many things that can be done from that device that, that, um, could be useful data to, to, to add further incremental information to our network.\nUm, like the, you had the rocks and, and sand analogy.\nSo this is kind of like the water, I imagine.\nThe dust of the water.\nYeah.\nUm, exactly.\nUm, the, that, that's exactly right.\nSo today we have, you know, 200,000 people, um, and, and, and thank you to everyone who overwhelmed us with, with the support for, for, for the, for the app, um, during this testnet.\nAnd we, we continue to have thousands of people sign up to, to contribute information.\nAnd, um, today we're capturing relatively passive information.\nSo, um, it's location data where your, where that device is.\nIt's all anonymized.\nUh, and it's also RF signature information.\nSo, um, what networks does that device see?\nBe it cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.\nAnd then if you're connected to any of these networks, what are the speeds?\nUm, which, which is a, a useful piece of data for ISPs, mobile network operators, MVNOs, WISPs to, um, understand network congestion, understand where, uh, their competitors have better quality of service vis-a-vis themselves.\nBut our intention with 375 is to continue to work with this community to create more and more meaningful ways at which they can add, um, value to the data that, uh, value to the network that we can then monetize.\nSo, so we're going to be integrating solutions into the product that have a more active participation.\nSo, um, if you're a 375 Go user in Paris and we have, um, a customer that wants to know the, the price of real-time gas prices in, in, in, uh, gas stations across, across Paris, and we have 5,000 people in on 375 Go that could go and get that data, we could fulfill upon that in potentially a matter of hours, and, and that could be monetized.\nThose users could be rewarded for their participation, and, um, that will create more network utility, which will drive, drive buy and burn.\nSo that's just one kind of basic example, but there we, we anticipate there being many ways for us to, um, leverage this audience, leverage this community of, of, of incentivized people to, to carry out tasks that relate to the things that your phone can do.\nAnyway, awesome.\nThe, um, another analogy, uh, or comparison, uh, that, um, you know, that came to mind is, um, with Grass.\nGrass is a, um, you know, leading DePIN, uh, project.\nIt's a portfolio company of Delphi Ventures.\nUm, what they're doing is, they're is actually similar to what you're doing in, in some way, right?\nBecause they, they capture, uh, real-time data, web data, digital data from the web, and you are gen, like, capturing real-time physical world data from roads, cities, um, so it's, it's quite, uh, kind of similar in that respect with Grass is, um, you know, it's pretty evident now that there is significant demand, uh, from LLMs to use that data for live context retrieval because LLMs, you know, they want to know what's happening in, in, in the web, right?\nWhat level of confidence you have the same happening in the in the real world, uh, you know, h, how soon or, or do you have any, any thoughts there?\nBasically, are we going to have, you know, robots, autonomous physical, uh, uh, AI devices that, that, that's going, going to want real-time world data?\nUm, I mean, I, the answer is, it's, it's, uh, it's inevitable.\nIt's not a question of, of, of if, it's a question of when.\nAnd I think when is like on our immediate horizon.\nUm, the, the Grass analogy is a great one.\nYou know, that's a project that I've been, you know, following, um, since, since inception, and, and kind of particularly given my background in data and, and digital advertising and so on, I could see those use cases.\nBut then when the, the light bulb around using this army of, of, and community of, of effectively nodes or botnet users who can, you know, access their bandwidth to get real-time information that, um, data sensors are not really well set up to do that, could then provide real-time inference into LLMs, then that certainly there was a light bulb moment for, for, for me and us internally about us being, you know, an equivalent to that in the real world, um, and this information being, um, incredibly valuable to the LLMs, uh, or, or to, you know, customers of the LLMs.\nOf course, businesses can upload proprietary data sets into their LLMs, whether that's their own customer data or other third-party data, of which if you're FedEx, the movement of vehicles is paramount to your business.\nAnd if an LLM doesn't have it, you're going to put it in there.\nSo they would either buy it from us, but of course, we would hope over time that we would, we will develop relationships with OpenAI, Anthropic, XAI, etc., to be a, a, a, a leading proprietary data source for, um, physical information, physical happenings.\nI, I think a, a meaningful difference, uh, another meaningful difference there could be, you know, Grass is, um, they identified the demand as being, you know, live context retrieval.\nSo it's more so on the inference side, whereas, cuz, cuz, you know, there's no edge in terms of pre-training data on the web, all the data is out there, and, um, and so there's, there's not a meaningful difference, uh, edge to gain, but that's not the case in the physical world, right?\nWe, we actually lack high-quality data in the physical world, so maybe like at some stage it could be quite interesting, uh, to serve these like training use cases as well in the, in the physical world.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, the LLMs don't have eyes and ears in the real world.\nThey definitely have eyes and ears in the digital realm, and they've read everything and watched everything and listened to everything that they could, and they'll always be ahead of anything new they would have already read before we've even know exists.\nUm, but, but they have a huge sensory blind spot to, uh, the real world, and I, I believe that that's a fourth dimension to which they will unlock, um, and particularly in robotics, automation, autonomous, autonomous vehicles, further information again beyond that of their own sensors.\nYou know, a Tesla can only see as far as a Tesla can see.\nSoon enough, cars will have car-to-car communication.\nSo then they can leverage the knowledge of another vehicle that's also autonomous, but they should also be leveraging the, the intelligence of sensors that are on the sides of the roads, uh, for example, um, or in the sky on drones, whatever it might be.\nAnd there are protocols and standards being developed for that, that exchange of data in this autonomous world, um, already.\nVery cool.\nUm, the, I guess the, the final point on the endgame type of scenario.\nUm, is there a world where, you know, just by the sheer number of, of data that you're collecting, you're able to improve your, your AI model, and then, you know, the endgame is, is actually not the, the data that you generate, but, uh, you build your own AI model for whatever purpose it may be?\nAre you, do, do you share that kind of vision, or is it too early to comment?\nUm, it, it's a, it's a, an interesting one.\nI, I didn't, that, I never kind of contemplated that, um, before, before a few weeks ago, I was with Chad, our, our chief AI officer, and he made the point of, we're getting really, really, really good at certain things, and those certain things are like vehicle-related stuff.\nSo, you know, he believes that given the quantity and scale of, of, of data that we're training upon and the, the quality of the data that we're training upon that, we quite quickly, if we're not already, becoming like the very best at identifying vehicles, um, and then identifying incidents, accidents, erratic driving, all the other things that become related to automotive.\nAnd, and those elements, um, certainly could become a commercial part of the business because there will be needs for that that, that aren't necessarily met by, um, open-source object, object recognition, um, generic things, which, which we use and are brilliant.\nBut we just have this, this very unique vantage point of, of seeing millions and millions and millions of different cars per day doing different things, and, um, it's, it's that unique source of data that, that other LLMs are just not ingesting at any great scale.\n\n\nHarry, what do you see as the biggest risk or challenge?\nIs there any existential risk to what you're building?\nWhat kind of keeps you up at night?\nUm, I mean, building stuff, building physical stuff like manufacturing stuff is not without its challenge.\nUm, you know, I'm fortunate and unfortunate, I guess, would be the way to describe it, to have experience in it because it is, you know, it is something that can cause headaches.\nYou know, we've gone through chip shortages and those kinds of eras.\nThere's certainly no reason why that also won't come back.\nGPU is in extremely high demand, tariffs and logistics of shipping.\nSo I'd say that that's a constant challenge and moving part to like manufacture things in a cost-efficient and time-efficient manner.\nUm, there are so many elements out of your control, and so far, touchwood, um, we've been successful.\nAnd I think certainly, you know, mine and Rob's time at links taught us a lot about making, you know, we made millions and millions and millions of Wi-Fi routers, so that without that experience, I would be more lost than than otherwise, but it is a challenge.\nAnd um, you know, for any DePIN enthusiasts out there who's bought pre-bought hardware and waited and waited and waited, and I've been in the same boat.\nYou know, it's hard.\nIt's hard, and I'm sure all the companies that are trying to deliver their products would love to deliver to you them, and their hands are being tied by a missing chip.\nIt could be one little chip, um, and they've got 99 other chips, but if they don't have that one, it doesn't work.\nAnd uh, yeah, and it's that's kind of the nature of the beast.\nCan't change the world without blood, sweat, and tears.\nThat's for sure.\nUm, we're we're about to, um, you know, we're just about out of time, but um, yeah, I got to ask this.\nYou know, uh, 375ai, how did you come up with that name?\nThat's that's oddly specific.\nIs there is there a meaning to it?\nUm, my my interpretation.\nYeah, go for it.\nGo for it.\nNo, no, no.\nI'm interested to hear yours before I before I tarnish.\nYeah, my guess is your the sensors and cameras they watch, you know, uh, three 360 degrees and then there's a 15 degree of of extra that I don't know why that that that's.\nYeah, that one's that's good.\nI haven't I've had people talk about how there's 365 days in a year and we're seeing 10 days more or something like that.\nBut the actual um, the actual reason is the extraterrestrial highway is highway 375 which runs through Area 51 in Nevada.\nAnd um, we we kind of thought there was some analogy between I guess the extraterrestrial world and what's now capable and possible with the advent of AI to to create otherworldly type experiences that that have never been done before.\nUm, so I guess it's it's somewhat the art of the unknown and and and and that was the plus we're we're you know, we have a big focus on vehicles and transport.\nSo Highway 375, the extraterrestrial highway was how was the inspiration behind uh 375ai.\nVery cool.\nHarry, really appreciate you coming on and walk us through the project, your vision, tech stack, the challenges, and yeah, I'm looking forward to uh, we are looking forward to work with you on this and then kind of uh, spend uh, yeah, countless hours together to put uh, you know, nodes all around the world, including the uh 375ai uh highway.\nYes.\nNo, we haven't got one there yet.\nSo, let's go spot some aliens.\nAwesome.\nThanks again for joining us.\nIt's been a pleasure.\nThank you.\n[Music]\n",
