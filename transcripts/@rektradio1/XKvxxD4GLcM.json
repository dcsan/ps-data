  "cleanText": "Hello.\nWho goes first this?\nI don't know. You tried to steal it from me, so I was waiting to see you try to rob it again.\nKeyboardMonkey3 is famously gone first for hundreds of episodes now.\nAnd I know, I know. I stole it after I was like I was we changed the show format because I thought I'd be, you know, like more like MCing it these days. But no, you you can still have it, KBM. Okay.\nThis is the first time with all four of us as well. We'll see how.\nYeah, I know. I haven't been here in a couple weeks. Uh, but yeah, Rekt Radio episode 112.\nThat's solid. We got a lot of stuff going on. Firmly in the treasury company meta going down the alt chain IP treasuries, Tron treasuries every day a new treasury company, so it's a lot going on out here. What's up fellas?\nFantastic. And we're live on kick, so go check us out. I think we've got the CHANNEL now has we're trying to close in on a thousand followers on the kick.\nOh wow, that's.\nOn kick, sponsored by YEET casino and wreck drinks and myriad.\nMyriad, an epic duck, and all sorts of whatever we can throw at it.\nUm, yeah, so go check us out on kick. We're obviously giving out prizes based on that as well. We'll give out a code midway through the show for people to come on and follow, but we're getting like hundreds of viewers on these at the moment, which is really nice.\nOh god.\nSo, that was my long show to begin with. I know right before we came live, you guys were talking about Conor McGregor's dick, but.\nYeah. Let's talk about that.\nIt was just me and Cook.\nYeah.\nYeah. We were just saw it, right?\nYeah.\nI haven't seen it actually. If anyone's got a link, it's Aelia Banks TWITTER.\nI was googling it for a while and I couldn't find it. I was like, Conor McGregor TWITTER, you'll find it straight. You'll find it straight away.\nUm, I don't really know.\nThe story is that he just like cold DM'd Avia Banks. Uh, seemingly his dick, like that's the result of a coke bender, like or some kind of upper bender, you know? He just got a little too horn.\nThat would make sense. This feels like I feel like that's not your first time, you know? Like,\nbro, it was like a it was a DM request screenshot and it's his dick and then it's a message that's like a pseudo threat. It's like rats get caught or something like that. And then the second picture of him like with some kind of a weight on his dick, right? Like very, very odd. There's drugs involved for sure. Like.\nYeah, his dick benches more than me at this point. So it it was a a strange um. Yeah, strange opening gambit. You just feel like he's he's probably done that a number of times. Um, he's really going off the rails though, really, isn't he? Like strange. Um, I can't really think of another sports person that's gone off the rails like that. Like feels like Tiger Woods, Antonio Brown, Antonio Brown.\nYes. Yeah. Yeah. But Antonio Brown wasn't like the best in the world at any stage.\nOh, he's one of the best wide receivers of all time.\nYeah. For a while. He was just like he was like number one.\nBut uh, he DMs me. He DMs me all the time. Like it's probably been a month, but oh man. Like when shitcoins were going crazy, ABM DMs all the time. He DM'd YEET actually too. Like I brought us to pay him.\nNo, no. He wants to run, bro. He's like, \"Oh, I got to pay child support. Like, let's drop a token.\" Like, yeah. He's the other day. He's like, \"Oh, I've never dropped a CA.\" And like this is like this week, like or like I don't know, four or five days ago. He's like, \"I've never dropped a CA. I'm going to drop my first one.\" And like somebody used some tool to like scrape his TWITTER and show all the times he's tweeted a CA. And it was like 59 times.\nI mean, I was at a conference. I was at a conference in London and he he actually I think he already sponsors somebody. I think he I think he sponsors BC Game, you know. Um, yeah, you got I went I went past their stand and it was it was Antonio Brown, Jason Derulo, and uh, I think like another UFC fighter maybe like.\nOh, but it was like, oh, they've really got the the crop there of people that will that will uh, yeah, sponsor a crypto casino. Antonio Brown and Jason Derulo coming in.\nI don't know anyone I trust more to handle my bets than, you know, the all knowing. I'd love them to handle it. Yeah. Jason Derulo thing was crazy, right? Jason Derulo is a pretty like big superstar and then he just dropped his like shitty little coin and everyone was fing it and he was like, \"No, man. Like I'm gonna like, you know, work hard at this and then he's just disappeared.\" Like, yeah. Once the price goes down, everything changes.\nFunny thing is all these guys like you tell any of your normie mates about Derulo or Antonio Brown, they're going to be like, \"Oh, like that guy's huge. I can't believe like you hung out, he DMs you or he can't believe he follows you.\"\nPeople like, \"Man, these guys are such losers.\" Like, it's.\nBro, football's like a religion to my brother. And I was telling him about AB, like sending him the screen caps like, \"Yo, look, he's like telling me he's got to pay child support. He wants to launch a coin with me.\" And like, he couldn't believe it. And I'm like, \"Bro, this guy's actually like a a clown in MySpace. Like, I don't even It's crazy. I even answer him only because I like AB.\" Like, yeah, it's really funny, man. They just.\nHere's a question for you guys.\nI've got a question for you guys. If we get like let's say we get AB a wrecked drink.\nSorry. Well, number one, get on the show.\nLet's say we get a wrecked drink. Is that bullish? Because it's a it's a also a norm and the normies are like, \"Oh, That's huge.\"\nYou get AB to like put a a wrecked photo or something of him drinking it on Instagram. That's crazy. I think it's different because it's a drink, right?\nYeah.\nYeah. Right. AB, you're not a loser. Hit me up.\nYeah.\nHe's still cool. I love him actually.\naround.\nThe third one was Colobby Coington. That was the the other person on it. Like that that was a the trio. But I was thinking about we think about this for YEET all the time. Like the things that you can get away with in broader marketing versus on CT, like there's like if you make one wrong move on CT, it's like, oh my god, like extractor or like oh, broken the social contract. All this sort of stuff.\nPeople will just get any any of these guys to just shill anything. It feels, bro, you don't even have to do anything on CT to get like it's not like it's a it's a it matters to me, right? Like it doesn't affect my my standing on CT. It's actually turned into a comical thing. But that that guy made a whole website to review people that you don't like, right? And they're just like, \"Oh yeah, no, he's a scammer.\" Like with no scams listed, it's just crazy, right? Like the real world. And then these rappers come in and drop 20 rugs on us and like do it again six months later. They'll all be back, which is cool. I'll let AB stick around CT and rug us. Like he's cool. He's a good character.\nThey do come back every every few months, isn't it? Every like six to 12 months, the same the same kind of crew come back and it's like it's like Soulja Boy, you know? It's just like he's back.\nYou know what point of the cycle it is where like people are ready to to buy a coin of sexy red. Like it it kind of just feels like that's that happens every six to 12 months and you know you're you're close to the top around it. Um, yeah, that doesn't feel like it's happening right now, though. That's what I would say. If we're going to bring it back to the market, like it, yeah, alltime highs, ETH trading well, a bunch of other things trading well. It doesn't feel frothy, I don't think, really to me. Um,\nI totally agree and I've been kind of tossing this idea around in my head actually, and I kind of want to know what you guys think of it, but like is there the potential that in the second half of this cycle or what? I look at it like it's the second half or like last third of the bull cycle. Is there the potential that we do not get a retail normmy frenzy because it's just a BTC land grab by institutions and everybody feels priced out and like if they came in a year ago they got smoked on memes. We don't have a new Ponzi to sell them. So I'm like ah, you know, is it actually going to going to get super frothy aside from the assets institutions want to buy?\nI think that's a pretty good way of thinking about it if I'm honest. Like if you remember how 2021 went, the normie part of 2021 was actually the first half and the second half people thought like buying NFTs or buying um, like these more like beta trades would be the trade and actually Bitcoin just hit an alltime high again and then nothing else really kind of hit that alltime high again. I get the feeling that this one this one feels like Tradfi have gotten on ETH trade and are now going to like pump the narrative a little bit here. You know, like they had the Bitcoin trade now like enough people have you had big influence ETF and now they're just going to be like, \"Right, we're just going to this is our altcoin. Like we're going to pump we're going to pump this for a little bit.\" I don't think this is a trade where like there's, you know, like put the just give me the contract like it doesn't feel like that at this stage like at all. I I would be and I think that's kind of that's kind of the error. I would be very wary of like beta trades if I'm honest because I don't think you have like the army of normies coming to buy the 10x.\nWhat I would say though, even though you don't have the army of normies, I think people forget how much capital there is in the system, especially if ETH rallies. Like there are tons of like mega ETH whales out there. If ETH goes to 5K, 10K plus, like there's a lot of wealth that's going to be printed and some of these guys like in 2021, obviously you had like meme coins that went crazy. Do ship NFTs. There's an argument to say that was retail, but you had this like crazy like DeFi stuff where like people just plowed like hundreds of millions of, you know, dollars into like random . And that capital I don't think was purely retail. So I do still I do still think like you don't necessarily need retail to come in to get to crazy levels and stuff. I think there's a lot of like quiet capital out there that will get activated if gets crazy. that isn't necessarily retail, but people just, you know,\nI I actually agree what you're saying. I like that though because it feels as though it will be the I don't know how to describe it, but it'll be like the cryptonative winners, the stuff that like actually crypto people want to bet on rather than just like, oh, random coin gets created by celebrity that will be the winner. Like you can see it's like you'll see it will be the stuff that people rotate into but they like the protocol like like a hyperlquid or a PENGU or a wreck. Like these feels they feel like more cryptonative brands which will be more of the winners.\nArtcoincoin being on that list. But I totally agree.\nI want to I want to read out something someone put in a group chat that I'm in. I hope they don't mind. But can we bring up the ETH BTC chart? Can we just bring this up because this is something that that I've been looking at as like normies coming back as well. But you you go OSF.\nThis is this is what got me like super horny.\nThis is what this is what this person said. Excited. Wrong wrong use of um words there. If we get an Ethereum onchain season with um institutional ETH bid and institutional onchain CT is going to be reminded of what real money looks like. These kids who joined in the last year have never seen hundreds of millions in liquidity, not market cap, aping into unodited LP farms hours after the farm launch. Never seen someone go from eight grand in ship to 5.7 billion dollars on chain. Never seen JPEG selling for six, seven figures with dozens of sales per day for months in a row, multiple wallets spending seven figures per quarter on each on one art. You think retail trenches were hot. You think your friends and family care were rich. 2024 to 2025 whales are basically human me bots or scammers. Trenches was a bunch of crackheads playing hot potato in comparison to 2020 to 2021. Ethereum whales a you rich tycoon rich NBA all-star rich. We get an institutional narrative and bid we get a real bull run.\nYeah. So, so I think I agree with that. I just I just don't love the narrative of like, oh, you should go all in on like the 10x. I I think people can make money, but I think you have to be very selective. I still think you have like look at that as a chart though that that feels like right now like that's the balls tingling of trad right there like they they've gone like right we can go and we can pump this thing a little bit and um you got enough people on it and it doesn't have to have that big a move like it could just go to 0.04 right and and and um it's not even close to alltime high. Uh, I think I think when it would start to get frothy is if ETH goes to like alltime high. That's when that's when the give me anything. I need a 10x sort of thing.\n\n\nI would start to come up again.\nUm,\n2K, I feel like it's still just the start of that.\nI actually think now that we talked about this and I looked at this BTC chart like yesterday, but uh so what I just said how I think okay maybe the retail guys are going to feel priced out of crypto because BTC whatever institutional land grab, but I've got like I've got normie friends sending me Instagram posts like about XRP and they're like, oh, this guy says if you put $1,000 in XRP, it's going to be 50,000.\nWhat do you think?\nAnd I'm like that's [ __ ].\nAnd like literally I had a conversation with my homie I've known for 20 years and he's like, I don't know, bro, like blah blah.\nAnd I'm like, listen, bro, you're telling Wayne Gretzky how to shoot the puck.\nLike, do you know who I am kind of thing, like not to sound like a dick, but like, bro, I mean, I've been doing this a while.\nSo anyways, my point being, actually, maybe they come to chase $ETH.\nAs much as I think $ETH is kind of gay and like whatever, but if $ETH goes to all-time high, then they're going to start saying it's going to 50 grand.\nAnd like it's a good thing for normies to chase because it's much more accessible than Bitcoin.\nAnyone I talk to about Bitcoin, and I've been telling the same people the same [ __ ] for at least five years, buy Bitcoin, DCA it, don't think about it.\nAnd they're, oh, but it's so expensive.\nWhy would I?\nBut what about this other thing, right?\n$ETH could fit the bill, man.\nLike, I I I just And I'm not bearish on Bitcoin at all.\nLike, I think Bitcoin's going high.\nI think that's the wrong way to look, but but I just feel as though this there's just enough people on it that that can make this happen.\nBut um so if we think that let's say $ETH does go to like four to 5K, let's just live in that world like it goes to 5K.\nWhat do you think is any are your winners there OSF?\nDo you I I can't imagine we get like a pump fund on $ETH style thing happening.\nSo like what what are the what's the 10x moves?\nIs it just the like the there's there's only a small number of $ETH memes, but like do you think it's DeFi that people go all in for?\nDo you think it's Well, it's it's two things I think.\nFirst, meme meme coins continue to show that they're a good like bait to the market.\nThe hard part now compared to a year and a half ago is that you have a lot to choose from, but that's only on $SOL.\nOn $ETH, there's probably like five memes to choose from, right?\nThere's Pepe, Mog.\nUm, Nero, I think, is the fourth largest meme.\nUm, what's the other big one that I'm missing?\nSPX.\nSPX.\nYeah.\nAnd then the fifth largest one is Wrecked.\nYeah.\nUm, so those are the top five memes on $ETH.\nAnd okay, is Pepe going to do a 10x?\nIt's tough, but it does take it to like Doge ship levels, which is possible for a meme that is such so well renowned as Pepe.\nCan Rekt do a 10x from 190 million market cap?\nYeah, absolutely.\nWhy not?\nLike it's those within that category.\nI think you want to own some of that stuff because it has a high probability of working out.\nDeFi stuff is is tricky, but I would I think there's two or three catalysts there that can get that stuff going again.\nI just don't know what I would own in that space.\nLike is it Lido?\nIs it Do you think there's any chance that people go back to trenching on Ether?\nLike I feel like I want to rip out my eyeballs and I\nThat's That's the beauty of Ether.\nIt's not trenching.\nThere's no PVP.\nIt's just five front runners and that's it.\nIt was for a while.\nFor a while it was Yeah, it it won't be trenching IMO, but they the teams will come back like and there will be traditional shitcoin launches that they try to push up to a billion and like half of them are scams.\nAnd I actually kind of like that environment because there's less noise and there's less like chaos.\nWhereas, you know, the environment of a thousand coins launched a minute on $SOL is fun, but there's a lot going on.\nSo, I think that if $ETH goes up a lot and memes kind of have to be part of the story, you'll actually see a lot of launches and they'll try to like do another Nero.\nLike Nero was only eight months ago or something, right?\nLike less, I think.\nSo, there'll be that stuff.\nIt could be good.\nMaybe there's some new stuff to emerge.\nBut, I think like I've always been a the winners will win more.\nLike the winners become super winners.\nSo that five coin list.\nActually, I want to FUD my baby Hyperliquid.\nUh, as you guys were talking, I tried to long Wrecked and Mog on Hyperlid and neither of them are on Perch there, which is a bit crazy.\nThen I'm like, I got Lighter open and I tried to go long them on lighter, which is like whatever.\nI'm not trying to show lighter, but sometimes they have stuff Hyperlid doesn't have.\nAnd so you got to get them to add wreck to pers on Hyperlid, bro.\nI should tweet.\nI'm going to tweet it right now to be honest.\nI actually texted OSF this like 3 days ago.\nI don't really know how it hasn't happened yet.\nWe we won an auction for a wreck ticker for the spot auctions.\nAnd so we will have wrecked on hyperlid spot very soon.\nIn order to get per you need to have strong community support from like the hyperlquid community.\nBut I think once we've got spot and we like we won we paid for tickets, we won the auction for it.\nThat's an interesting thing by the way.\nI think these I think these hyperlquid auctions right now for spot tickers are [ __ ] cheap.\nLike we paid 35 grand or whatever it is for ours.\nI think the next one printed at like close to 40k.\nBut this stuff these tickets were printing for like 500k back in December or something.\nAnd at the end of the day, like look at how much volume pump Fund Spot did on Hyperlid.\nLike insane amounts of volume.\nSo it's very clear that it's going to be like one of the main trading venues.\nprobably even like potentially better and more supported than some of the tier one centralized exchanges.\nSo to pay like you know five figures to get onto like to get your spot ticker onto it I think is an absolute bargain and I reckon those auctions will be like 100k plus very soon um like in a few days and I think they're going to go up to like seven figures for those auctions because it's just like you're getting naming without naming names.\nHow much do you reckon it is to to get onto a tier one exchange for spot and pubs?\nYou know, it it depends.\nLike there are some tier one exchanges which don't charge you anything for it if you if you've demonstrated enough volume and demonstrated, you know, enough support.\nFor some tier one exchanges, you can kind of like muddle your way through and pay seven figures to do it.\nSome of them require like seven figure security deposits where you have to hit certain targets in order to get your money back.\nSo, it's not cheap.\nLike generally speaking, apart from like one or two of them and it's where one or two of them where you don't have to pay anything but it's extremely hard to get on to them.\nThe others are not cheap.\nThey're very very expensive.\nAnd here you can get on to Hyperlicker which is up there on all with all of them and you're paying [ __ ] you know it cost us like 35 grand.\nLike that is I'm sorry but that is an absolute steal and a complete mispricing of the cost of getting a spot ticker onto Hyperlid where there is a [ __ ] ton of capital right now.\nlike that is the wrong price and I'm glad we put one hour auction but it's the wrong [ __ ] price.\nYeah, I mean it did dominate the pump fun launch, right?\nLike you could see from the volumes that it was dominating even the other exchanges.\nI I actually agree with that take.\nI think that's that's a very good I mean it's a good use case for for any of these exchange coins if I'm honest.\nLike I'm surprised Binance haven't haven't thought about this for just BMB, right?\nlike having auctions for B&B in their uh for listings, right?\nWell, their business model is like insider scams, right?\nThey just buy dead coins or like demand half the supply.\nLike they're actually Look, Hyperlquid is going to change the way that the entire industry works and probably a bit of Tradfy, too.\nLook what Phantom did, right?\nLike they're now a distributor for Hyperlid.\nOSF, totally agree with you.\nThe tickers are massively underpriced.\nThey'll be seven figures.\nI think buying a ticker is pro is way smarter than buying an $ETH name ever was.\nNot like I'm going to do it, but I've tossed the idea around because people aren't going to have an option, right?\nThere'll be no other venue.\nLike hyperlquid will have all the liquidity.\nAnd so it's already happening fast.\nLike look at pump man.\nIt's crazy.\nand Binance the you know how you don't have to believe me but the proof that I'm right is CZ talking about how he's going to start a darkpool DEX during all that James win stuff and he's like a full transparency is bad I'm going to start a Darkpool Dex and blah blah blah bro he's coping the richest guy to ever come out of crypto is coping and then and then he said he's never actually made a trade on a DEX so like he has no idea what he's talking about right so yeah massively bullish buy tickers Maybe.\nI don't know.\nI'm not going to buy any with the rack tick.\nYeah, you should you should look for tickers that haven't yet been taken.\nThe way it works is you you win like the right to deploy a ticker.\nSo, you should look for tickers that haven't yet been taken and then just bid them like and you'll probably be able to move them because at some point it will be seven figures.\nAnd if you get a good ticker, there must be some good [ __ ] out there that hasn't been taken yet.\nI bet.\nSo, it's like it's like ENS or like kind of like the ENS kind of vibe.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYou gota like you gotta rob somebody.\nLike you gotta you gotta pick somebody who's going to have no choice.\nI was gonna ask this C because you're probably a bit closer to it because I do think that in that world of $ETH 5K people will naturally look if it's not at hype I do think they'll look at like the hype ecosystem.\nIs there is there much you think to pay attention to right now with the hype EVM stuff?\nI saw that there was that project X which launched which had a lot of hype as in like um a lot of people selling it but then it I don't want to say disappointed but it just seemed to be a Dex and people were like oh maybe this isn't as big as it was but is there are there things that you're playing on it?\nNo man there aren't.\nUm 99% of my hype exposures just stay typ like I I make trades and stuff and like I actually use it as my preferred like spot exchange.\nI don't use any sexes like I'm using it a lot but uh my assets like allocated to hype as a trade are all just stay typ like I'm doing stuff I've tried out the protocols and I think it's a good place to explore but um yeah it's a net additive thing right but I think that like we'll have to go down the road a bit to see how the EVM and Hyperlid core and like their their stack all works together and like what Jeff's grand vision is because they don't really talk a lot, right?\nThey just release stuff and yeah, I think that you'll see like you know they just did core writer which is like it gives I and I'm not a technical guy, right?\nSo don't like crucify me in the comments but uh it allows the EVM DAPs to write to hyperl core and like that'll open up a bunch of different types of DeFi use cases and stuff like that I can't describe but I think it's early.\nI'm not really I guess the for me the reason to be on the EVM exploring some of the protocols would be for like a forthcoming hyperlquid airdrop because surely that will pay play into it but for me it's still it it it makes the most sense to just have hype staked you're going to get the airdrop too and like my I guess my active time spent looking around for ways to make money in crypto.\nI'm trading pers a bit on hyperlquid but it's still just memes especially with the pump thing.\nThere's a lot of excitement back.\nUm, so I don't think it's like the active I don't I don't want to call it mid-curve because maybe I'll be wrong, but like a lot of people are writing these hype EVM farming guides.\nI don't think that's the approach, but I am watching.\nBut I think you've hit a nail on the head, which is something I do think will come back pretty strong, which is we spoke about how we slightly prefer these sort of app chains or apps which become more and then they're going to allocate some of that airdrop to like the the native ecosystem.\nWe spoke about hype pump.\nPeople are talking about maybe the creator coins get part of the airdrop.\nLike maybe that's maybe that's part of the trade.\nAbstract I feel like with the move in PENGU now kind of makes that a more interesting ecosystem suddenly too because I think people are just like looking for exposure.\nI I can imagine that that dominates the next six months.\nThose three things pump abstract and hype.\num with with the desire for some coming upcoming airdrop for all three of them kind of getting people back to farming.\nYeah, PENGU is nuts, man.\nThat's good that you pulled up the chart.\nLike, look at this thing, man.\nIt looks like wrecked.\nUh which is also sick.\nBut, uh Luca's just been nuts.\nLike, come on.\nThis is crazy.\nHe got every business in the world that's like cool to change their PFP to a penguin.\nLike, really?\nThat's like a can't fade the team thing.\nAnd it's a good meme.\nIt's It's like wholesome, but it's also cool.\nAnd like I think it'll be I tweeted today that and I got that I think it's\n\n\nLike the third time Anson's retweeted a post about mine about $PENGU quote tweet.\nBut uh, I think it'll be the second biggest meme by the end of the cycle.\nI don't know if it'll stay there forever.\nAnd I'm they the penguins, they have the right mentality.\nThey're in my comments being like, \"Cook, it's going to flip Doge.\"\nLike, I personally don't think it can flip Doge, just like nothing can flip Bitcoin.\nJust a Bitcoin of meme coins, and it's fine if it becomes the second biggest memecoin in crypto.\nThat's [ __ ] amazing.\nI think that's what'll happen by the end of the cycle, or there's a really good chance.\nI love $PENGU, and then that has made me, I kind of been fa not fading Abstract.\nI like it because like I think them and Pump will have to go to war over streaming, right?\nAnd like I think Abstract's got a good angle on it all.\nAnd like again, the management, like they have the Allen's based, like one is super DGEN, right?\nOne is like more consumer product for everybody.\nBut $PENGU's move for sure has me more interested in Abstract, whereas I wasn't really putting money over there.\nI was kind of [ __ ] around.\nI did a couple streams and like, you know, but yeah, $PENGU is going to is going to change the trajectory of Abstract.\nI think so too.\nI think that's that's change.\nWe spoke about it a week ago whether it was like a distraction or maybe, you know, he should have just focused on $PENGU.\nNow if we do head into this $ETH to 4K, I think $PENGU, because it's an L3 or whatever, like it becomes more interesting play.\nThere has been some deening on there.\nI know people have been like there's been meme coins, there's been certain numbers of like runners that people have been doing there.\nI can imagine that they had a really good gamefi ponzi.\nDid you see Big Coin?\nYes.\nI'm kind of waiting for another, and it was a cool, like all the streamers were streaming it, and like people were interested.\nIt collapsed very fast, but like it was pretty cool.\nI think a gamefi type Ponzi that's streamer friendly on Abstract could really cook.\nThere's probably some some teams probably cooking one up right now.\nMore than one, but I'm interested in that kind of stuff.\nStuff that's streaming friendly on Abstract.\nYeah, I mean, we've we've been in the queue of stuff to get done.\nWe we're looking to integrate E um with them, but uh, we need to get a couple of things sorted with like Privy to get that done.\nBut I it it with a streaming audience, you need that DJ product that people are actually playing on a or like can stream on a regular basis or can go to easily.\nAnd it feels like gaming, gambling, like trading are like the probably the three in crypto which work the best.\nWe're actually on kick now.\nWe are regularly like the number one stream in the crypto section for for kick at the moment.\nLike there's not put that on the pitch deck for Allen.\nYeah, exactly.\nWe got the pump deal.\nDo you we that was another thing we spoke about today, like if it's $ETH or this doesn't feel as as um there's that many like main characters, let's say, or like there's not um a lot of the K's kind of burnt themselves out in the first half of this year.\nI think there's a few different coins that people own for like that kind of cult of personality.\nWe spoke about how um SPX and Nurad OSF, you got Rex, like there's various like more bonk guy related coins, but there's there's not that many others, and I was thinking that maybe Rasmircoin is not a terrible trade here, like as a coin that could two to 3x and maybe get an airdrop.\nIt's only at 10 million.\nIt's not a It's not in no way is it a is it a meme, but you we we kind of gave him his flowers maybe a couple of weeks ago for like being the hardest working.\nI get the feeling that he may that one's not a bad if you're looking for a DJ player.\nIt's not a bad one.\nI love Rasmir.\nI think he's he's the best cryptonative streamer, and I don't think it's close.\nI'm not trying to like trash anyone else, but he's awesome.\nLike he's funny.\nLike the zoomers are going to like him.\nWell, we got to see like if he can grow, but my thesis is like he can do pretty good.\nIf if that's where like if there's an appetite for this stuff and people want to come from outside crypto to consume [ __ ] crypto streams and gamble on coins, I would back Rasmir.\nI actually just bought some of the coin.\nUm, because that's a good idea.\nI I think.\nDid you see him calling out Aiden Ross for selling his $ETH at the lows?\nThen Aiden had a little bit of a meltdown, and then $ETH has just continued to rally.\nI think it's kind of funny because Aiden Ross was seen as like, \"Oh, he called the top perfectly,\" but he should have kept onto his $ETH, and then he would have been like like kind of a mini god in crypto for like knowing that Salana wasn't the trade at that time and like, but he sold his e, so it's not I don't know if it really works as well, but you're right, like they know him, the mainstream clearly, like the fact that um that uh Aiden Ross like knew him by first name says that he's he's being annoying enough that people know who he.\nI I love this orangey meme, by the way.\nOh, yeah.\nThe orangey memes.\nThat meme below.\nIt's just getting started.\nIt's so good.\nHe was on a You see him on the on the private jet?\nI did see that.\nThat was the biggest reaction.\nThey're just kids, man.\nLike [ __ ].\nThat's what people do when they're that young and have a ton of money.\nHave no idea.\nLike they're going to look back on that when they're our age and be like, \"What the [ __ ] was I doing?\"\nBut I probably I probably would have done the same thing if I was like [ __ ] 22 and worth seven or eight figs.\nThat's a prime example of marketing that works for people outside of crypto but doesn't work for people inside of like outside of crypto be like, \"Oh my god, it's so cool,\" like, \"Oh, nice car, nice jet,\" whereas inside the crypto, like you show any sort of flashiness, no one just like piles on you.\nYou have to be like Kobe, you know.\nMaybe that's why I like Rasmir, and I don't like these other guys on the jets.\nLike not like I don't like them, but it doesn't really resonate with me.\nAnd Rasmir was just kind of like he was on the street in a mud dang costume, right?\nAnd you just had the video, he's pitching Fartcoin to like a hedge fund, like, but he's Yeah, he's not he's not pulling up in a Maybach and saying like, \"Watch my stream and you can be rich too.\"\nLike yeah, crypto rejects that, man.\nThat just means scammer.\nWe've seen it too many times.\nYeah.\nUh, yeah.\nThoughts on your house?\nThis is easily my favorite uh my favorite thing about crypto in the last six months.\nOh my god, we're glazing Rasmir so hard.\nUh, yeah, I I hope to house well.\nI I like that meme.\nUm, cool.\nSo we're basically saying we think this continue.\nIt feels it does feel like a a Trafi has discovered $ETH and is willing to shill it.\nAnd there's it's easier to maybe choose the five coins that you that you'd pick.\nUm, there's probably going to be some big gainers, but it may be more $ETH related.\nAnd we're kind of saying pump fun uh ecosystem, hype ecosystem, abstract ecosystem may be the places to look.\nI think I agree with that.\nI top down, like those are the places where I think you're going to make the most money.\nI I said it last week though, and I'll say it again now.\nPart of me thinks that Salana is is due a candle where like it's become everyone's like written it off a little bit.\nIt's it's definitely become less consensus.\nYou know what I mean?\nIt's become like it's become like the $ETH of 2024 a little bit here.\nAnd I reckon it's it's got a it's got a move, which probably means like Fcoin like doubles.\nYou know what I mean?\nYeah, I agree with you.\nThe issue, well, not the issue, like I hold some $SOL.\nUm, and I'm bullish on $SOL longterm with no time frame.\nBut I guess my response to that or the first thing I think is that uh people were saying about that saying that about $ETH for like two years.\nYeah.\nYou know, like every week on the timeline just like, \"Oh, it's bottomed.\nLike just wait, you're going to see a move you've never seen before.\"\nAnd it's like goes down another 80% over the next year.\nLike, so you never know what's going to happen.\nTo be clear, I I I completely agree with that.\nI think it's I think it's going to be like $ETH in that it rallies last and you sell everything when it rallies.\nYou know, it's like, \"Oh god, Salana is rallying now,\" and like, you know, that's like the final thing.\nBut at the same time, in that in that world, Pepe rallied, Mog rallied.\nI think Fartcoin can rally.\nI think some of the major $SOL memes, $PENGU's rallying right now.\nLike I think I I don't think $SOL Beta is necessarily a terrible trade.\nI just don't know if $SOL is.\nCool.\n$SOL's 172.\nIt already happened.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt's a pretty big move.\nLike, I haven't checked.\nCool.\n$ETH's about I mean, look at the $ETH jar right now.\nYeah.\nWell, he's crazy.\n23% a week.\nYeah, that's big, isn't it?\nIt outperformed Hyperlid over seven days.\n22% for hype.\nThat's crazy.\nWow.\nWe're close to hitting 3,300 now.\n[ __ ]\nWe we were speaking about it before in that do you think pump takes a little bit out of the the the wind out of the sales of Hyperlid.\nIt does feel like that is a narrative on the timeline now a little bit.\nUm, and pump has did you know pump's up 50, 60% since the since TGE, and I think we we all said it was a long and we all said it was around there, like it wouldn't be like it wouldn't be a three or 5x, but it would be like a 2x.\nUm, do do you think.\nI think they will be com I think they'll be compared endlessly because they're the big revenue generating app businesses.\nUm, but I don't know if they're really in direct competition.\nI saw a post yesterday that called Pump uh, sorry, Hyperlquid a bet on the acceleration of markets and Pump a bet on the acceleration of degeneracy.\nAnd so I think that they're not in direct competition, but like they're similar bets.\nI see that.\nThat makes sense to me.\nWhat do you think, KBM?\nLike on on pump, I know you were gone in for the TGE.\nYou said you got out like.\nYeah.\nNo views.\nI don't know.\nNo.\nNo.\nVolume goes up.\nI thought I thought it would be OSF that takes a backseat more, but it's actually been you more like.\nYeah.\nNo battle and depression about not owning any of these assets.\nSo, no, just gonna if you could ride this thing up to 5K, dude.\nThis thing this thing is not having any dips.\nLike, no, it looks great.\nYeah.\nNo, it was wonderful.\n$ETH does look really good.\nAnd I'm I'm also coping a bit cuz when Abstract launched, like for the launch, I LPD like for the first week, and uh then I was like pretty bearish on $ETH, and I took it all off and just sold it all, and then like I sold most of my I think I was out of $ETH by 2500 and like whatever, I made a bag, but I have very little $ETH left, and I'm like I mean a lot of it went into hyperl and was whatever, you know, like opportunity cost is higher if I didn't make those moves, but I'm still looking at $ETH like I deserve this because I I was impatient, and now I'm going to get like I'm going to die of coke because it's going to go to 10k finally.\nUm, I longed it and stuff, right?\nBut I had like, you know, I had a sizable spot bag, and I just got too bearish.\nI think that it it's it that's what it looks like it's trading like right now.\nIt feels like the dips are not are just getting bought.\nUm, when Peter the is like fomoing into an $ETHcoin $ETH treasury company, like you just feel as though, \"Oh god, like yeah, this is going to be bid.\"\nUm, I I think we called it all right OSF, you you said you sold the $ETH for the with the rec treasury, and I was like, \"No.\"\nYeah, I mean, we sold the $ETH, but we did buy we spent 200k buying backcoin.\nGuess how much that's worth now.\nWell, you know, Michael, cuz I texted you today about it, but it's worth.\nI don't know.\nI didn't I didn't look.\nIt's worth almost $1.2 million.\nWow.\nSo, you did a 6x.\nWe did a 6x from that.\nYeah.\nWhich we still own.\nBut, um, so I was like, \"Okay, we have enough like crypto exposure for our treasure.\nWe don't need to log.\"\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat was pretty good trade.\nUm, yeah.\nI I think I do think that it will probably have like one nasty wick down just know just knowing that people are going to like FOMO into this sort of stuff.\nBut I uh I think I think it's it's pretty clear that it goes to 4K.\nWhether it goes to 5K, I think is is kind of is is kind of the more difficult decision.\nUm, and then on these treasury sort of companies we spoke about, I think we spoke about expert on this show or did we show speak about it on Friday show, but that one that one like did a 3, 4x, and everyone's piling into that.\nIs there any of these other players that you think could be could be interesting?\nLike $COIN just hit an alltime high again.\nLike it's getting frothy out there for a bunch of those crypto companies, but I feel as though they could just keep going.\nLike they may be I still think $COIN may be a better long than 99% of of crypto here.\nI like Circle a lot.\nI got a bag of Circle.\nUm, yeah, I think it can get really big.\nIt's like the regulated stable coin issuer.\nThat's American.\nSky's is the limit, man.\nIt's like the digital Fed of the decentralized world.\nYeah, I think Circle can can b like can can do well.\nI I don't know if it's going to go like a 10x.\n\n\nFrom here, I guess I'm looking for, because this is a bit more like a 10x sort of a show, but does it feel as though they're just going to go higher if the rest and there's a build today, right, about it? What about NFTs? Do you think any of that stuff comes back? Cuz PENGU PUMPING's massively outperformed Pudgy Penguins NFTs. But you're right, OSF, that like in the past, $ETH whales, when they've become wealthy, it would only make sense, right? Think NFTs are coming back too. If $ETH is...\n\nArthur Hayes. Arthur Hayes rocked up, man wants to buy some one art. Let me know.\n\nHere we go.\n\nThose are the days, those are the days me and me and KeyboardMonkey3 had to have bidding bidding on [ __ ].\n\nGood stuff.\n\nYou're right. 2021 was a very different sort of cycle. I, I don't know if crypto arts come. There was a crypto art auction this week, right? Which for which caused some controversy, like it didn't sell out, and I think it was close or something like that. It still doesn't feel like crypto art is really at a spot where, like, people are people are buying it. But I think Crypto Punk's good. Like if Arthur Hayes rocks one and you get all these other $ETH like Trad people rocking them again, that could become a bit of like a good again.\n\nDidn't Trump say that he's going to start a strategic NFT treasury like yesterday on True Social? I swear unless it was...\n\nNo, no, no. It was a, it was a camel um [ __ ] post and Mario...\n\nHe's been...\n\nMario Noral retweeted it or like posted it as like an original post, and everyone thought it was real.\n\nWhoa, what a good [ __ ] post. Geez. Yeah, I just saw like a screenshot and I was like, \"Well, that's insane.\"\n\nHe got me with the 500 million is locked in the pump contract as well. Um, uh, he's got me a couple of times at the moment. Low key.\n\nHe's good. I do rate him a lot. He's funny.\n\nHe knows that no one ever checks the chain or or like particularly goes onto a different platform to check what's been posted. Like no one's ever...\n\nI don't have True Social, like...\n\nExactly. Like you, you could say anyone said anything on truth social and probably people would believe you.\n\nIt's just like checking the chain. But uh, yeah. Yeah. Do you think, do you think any of those are plays? Maybe punks. Do punks have...\n\nProblem is, it's a question of like, um, opportunity cost, right? Like if you have punks aren't cheap, so it's a lot of money you put in a punk and then could something else outperform? Could something else be more liquid? You can sell partials or something else. You can't really like partially sell your punk. That's the tricky, that's the tricky part, I think.\n\nWhat about ma lady?\n\nIs gonna gonna be the...\n\nI mean, you can imagine...\n\nAll time, like everyone should own a mady, I think.\n\nI think they're, they're like the most durable NFT that ever came out, maybe aside from punks, like they always had a community in the bare market, they spawn the most derivatives, like what I was saying before we went live, like actually if you do the derivative test, me has more derivatives than anyone by a mile.\n\nThere's like a rio derivative on every [ __ ] chain, like...\n\nYeah, at least one. Most chains have a couple.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nENS, are they coming back? Is it cool to have a $ETH again?\n\nWe're about, we're about three-digit ENS's.\n\nWe still have our three-digit ENS's. We should...\n\nWe still have one. Yeah, it's a now four E. It's four E. I was going to say we should dump it, but um, it was trading at two E, I think. So...\n\nSo those are rallying, actually.\n\nUm...\n\nI wouldn't mind offloading some of those.\n\nYeah, maybe ENS. I don't know.\n\nActually, you know what a good beta $ETH is? ENS, like the actual, like coin. I wonder how that's doing.\n\nOh, you mean like the coin? Yeah. Yeah, that's probably, that's probably gig.\n\nThat's a good basis to see...\n\nThe ones that people have. Yeah, it's up 20% today, actually. Good call.\n\nWell, not late...\n\nAnd looks like a nice little chart.\n\nThat looks like a nice chart.\n\nYeah, that, that one sense. The other ones in DeFi that I think have been brought up are like the bigger names. There's Syrup, which is like the Maple Finance one, which is, which is um, tra, like 400, 500 million, which people look at. Um, you know what else could send? Ethereum Classic.\n\nWhy do you always bring up Ethereum?\n\nI love Ethereum Classic. That, I guarantee Ethereum Classic at $20 right now. I guarantee that will do like a two or 3x at some point in the next like three months, and it's just there just going to be one day when everyone's like, \"Oh my god, Ethereum Classic is like ripping.\"\n\nThat's when you sell it. Yeah. To be clear, that's when you sell it.\n\nThat is when you sell everything. I, I don't know. Like maybe Ethereum Classic. I don't think we can come on Rekt Radio and say that's a 10x.\n\nI love it.\n\nYeah. God, no. That's a horrific chart. I'm not, I'm not getting involved in that, dude.\n\nThat's a, that's a tempting chart. You don't think it's a tempting chart?\n\nMaybe. Maybe.\n\nI like it.\n\nI think some of the DeFi days look nice. Like um, there's some that I think could, could actually gigend, but, but we're talking like 3x. I think an $ETH, honestly, I think an $ETH rally is not like a Solana rally because it's, it's, it's a less DGEN. It's just less DJ now. It's a bit more institutional. It's a bit more like 40 plus year olds own stuff, and like they're not in it for a 10x. They're in it for like a two or 3x and like good year.\n\nThey'll probably chase uh, like L2 governance tokens, like ARB and Optimism, stuff like that could do okay for a 2x, you know, it will be like ARB is gonna 2x. I, I just don't feel like any of this stuff is like, oh my god, this is just going to like gig send.\n\nI think um, I think that will probably stay on Solana, but just with less capital, let's say, like send stuff or hyperlid will be the big movers. I don't know if there's anything else like in terms of like stuff that that I'm looking at. I looked at some of the AI stuff this week with like Gro 4 and like if there's any interesting AI meets crypto plays, but it still feels like that's a little bit like a graveyard of people saying it's going to be a big thing, but...\n\nYeah, none of those AI stuff that you, you held. I know you got rid of them at some stage, but like they, they kind of just peted out again.\n\nYeah, I'm not a, I'm not a big believer in crypto AI.\n\nI think, well, who knows, man. Like Tao and Kea did okay.\n\nCrypto. Yeah. I mean, I still, I actually think it's going to have another run, but um, I don't own any of it anymore because I simplified everything that I had just to focus on Rekt Radio. But I do think you'll see another run in that stuff at some point this year.\n\nThat's what I was saying. Like AI6Z never really is still like hanging out. Kind of close to the lows. None of those coins have really participated.\n\nVirtual virtual counted.\n\nLooking virtual is a decent amount off the lows, I say.\n\nDo we have to do...\n\nVirtuals? We're running up against time. I think we got a hard stop, right? So, all right. Yeah, fair enough. Virtuals, I think they, they've played like a marketplace thing and it hasn't quite worked out. So, I don't know if that's going to work.\n\nUh, KeyboardMonkey3, you want to take it away with the spins? Who's gonna...\n\nYeah, I mean I have the, I have the count up, but I don't know what to do.\n\nI think in town, are you around?\n\nI guess we're spinning right now for who's coming up today.\n\nOkay, run.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, we're spinning it one, three times, right? Or three times. So, to be clear, oh, we have 138 viewers. Wow, that is, that is decent. Um, we're doing this based on your volume each week, by the way. So, make sure you're betting on your, I think we have like a minimum amount that you have to have done each week um, to be eligible.\n\nNever lucky.\n\nTwo now.\n\nNever lucky.\n\nNever lucky. Wow.\n\nLucky.\n\nOh, I thought it was...\n\nOh, wow.\n\nIt's not arty. Art arick.\n\nNo.\n\nUm, okay. So, how do we want to do it? So, we've got three, we've got three winners. I think we just play for them then quickly and and...\n\nThis is the most efficient show we've done with four. KeyboardMonkey3 keeping us honest with the uh, the timing.\n\nYeah. You know, I was having so much fun. And I wanted to, I didn't want to go much.\n\nWhat's wrong with you? You just depressed because $ETH's going high.\n\nMany such reasons, but um, anyway, are we doing Lamb Chop?\n\nYeah, let's, let's do Lamb Chop. I think it's the funnest game. So, do you want to, do you want to run it? KeyboardMonkey3 feels like the sort of guy's taking you to the barn.\n\nYeah. Yeah. No, we're going to the barn.\n\nWhat are the, what are the rounds?\n\nSo, I think you, no, we do it with a thousand, right? So, they got 500 in the bank and it's one round of, should we get the music up?\n\nYeah. Well, okay. The [ __ ]. Can you guys hear it now?\n\nYeah, we can. Yeah.\n\nWhat if I full screen? Oh, look at that.\n\nOkay. Um, who, who is this for? Who we playing for this time?\n\nYeah.\n\nDo you know?\n\nWho's the first person?\n\nOh, here we go.\n\nEunk. Eunk. Who's playing for Eong?\n\nWhich one are you guys?\n\nE. Are you, you can say how far you want us to go if you want Eong in the chat. If not in the chat thing, why don't you guys just do it? Why don't we just do it our way?\n\nAll right, I'll do it. I'll do it.\n\nI'll do one of them.\n\nGo.\n\nGo.\n\nOh, did you say go? You didn't. Go ahead.\n\nI didn't say go yet. I didn't say go yet. Where do you think I'm at? This is...\n\nI think go one more time.\n\nOh my goodness. That was going to be...\n\nI'll do never luckies. So, Eang, I'm sorry. You get 500 lucky. Sorry.\n\nOkay.\n\nCome on. Let's go.\n\nHere we go. Now, I think we should bank this, right, brother?\n\nAll right, Arctic.\n\nOh, C. All right, C, you're up.\n\nOh, he shed me like that.\n\nNo.\n\nToday, boys.\n\nThey're just 500 each for all of them.\n\nWe should do one more spin for everyone. Let's do one more spin for all of them. I, I'll run it. I'll run it. I'll run it. We'll split it between you guys. Okay, go. Let's go four times and see where we end up. No, don't do this.\n\nThis is, this is a joke.\n\nLooks like there's a lot of RTP left for whoever plays next.\n\nShould we try one on death wish?\n\nThat's not worth it. Hard. Let's try one on very hard.\n\nOkay, just once.\n\nAll right, fellas. Good day.\n\nAll right, 500 for everyone. Sorry, guys. We really did try and win you guys more money there. Um, we'll have to do it next time. 500 each. Good. Good. GG's everyone.\n\nGood show. Um, I've been hearing whispers that big traders are watching this show. Big traders are upset with some of the comments we're making. Big traders are...\n\nYeah. Yeah, dude. I've, I've seen screen, I've seen screenshots of, of uh, of people upset uh, with our based takes each week, but I'm loving it. I think the show is really, really, really, really good at the moment. Um, and go follow us on Kick. Like we said, we're approaching a thousand followers on Kick and we're getting 150 to 200 live viewers a show. So, this is going to be the biggest show in crypto. We're going full rasmin.\n\nRasmir mode.\n\nHit us up, Alan. Hit us up. Uh, Luca, let's do it. Let's go.\n\nAll right, guys. See you guys soon. See you guys next week.\n",
