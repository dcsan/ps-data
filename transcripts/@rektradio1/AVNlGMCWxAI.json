  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nWelcome, Rekt Radio, Ep. 110.\n\nI thought I was taking hosting. Damn, you were hostile takeover in my intro takeover there. Yeah, Episode 110, I was coming in hot. I was coming in hot. Wow, I was getting taken over. A job like OSF, we replaced OSF up with Cook. It feels that way. Episode 110 is sick, I gotta say. Was it always once a week?\n\n110. Sponsored by YEET, the best crypto casino. The only one you should be playing on. I agree. Actually, last time I was sort of like, uh, 40% effort shilling luck a little bit, but now luck is trash. I don't know if you saw the probability issue. Like, they can change it. Yeah, now I'll f him. I don't care. I got rid of the badge coming at us. I don't even know why. Very bizarre behavior. We've stopped engaging just because every argument's been in bad faith so far. So people do whatever. Yeah, it's it's pretty much slash ignore at this point.\n\nSee that weirdo trading acts main post. Who the [ __ ] knows what's going on there. Yeah.\n\nAndrew, everyone says that's Andrew Tate in uh... Yeah, it's definitely not Andrew Tate, bro. It's like some guy in his garage in [ __ ] London.\n\nUm, uh, we can see the kick chat. Okay, awesome. I'm I'm I'm on the kick. Have you guys gone on the on the kick? It's quite cool. Um, it's worth worth going on. We, we only, uh, we've kind of swapped producers today again back to our normal producers who are back on the reream. So we're not going to be able to see the chat on on um on up on screen today, but we'll be we'll be there hanging out. So go go check us out on kick. Go follow us as well. Um, obviously a lot of the prizes are going to be tied to that, but yeah. Uh, YEET versus luck.io. It feels like not even a thing though. I don't know. Feels like we're not we're not going to go there this week. Too too too much drama with with those guys. I don't even know. It's just bizarre. It's weird. But whatever they want to do.\n\nBut it's good to have you back, Cook. Obviously, yes, last week full week as a as kind of a co-host. OSF is is apparently going to be coming through halfway halfway through the show. Uh, Rekt Radio with special guest OSF, who's leading wrecked uh wrecked drinks, who seems kind of funny, but yeah, he's he will be coming through. Either way, we're going to continue the same sort of format, um, which is more just like a conversational show. I think we're going to touch points upon a bunch of stuff, but I think last week we'll just go back to what we were saying last week, which is just we said that, you know, War News was always a buy. It did [ __ ] did happen, like, over the weekend, obviously got it got bombed uh, the main main plants in Iran, and then quick ceasefire. It seems like could extend into something a bit more serious now. But I was taking a step back and thinking there's not much else, right? Like, I kind of feel like one thing that Trump did here was show that Russia and Ukraine that he's he's he kind of means business. Like there was a lot of, oh, he, you know, he's all chat, then he always backs out at the last minute. This wasn't all chat, and I think that's kind of useful for negotiating to show that you can go you can go there. But like in terms of like geopolitical flare-ups, you've only really got China to invade Taiwan, which I don't think is going to happen this year at least. So then it's just kind of back to this, when's the Fed going to cut? It feels as though in some ways, is it is it now like a much better investing horizon here, even for crypto? Like there's not really much that's really going to derail you now?\n\nThat was odds. The odds of a cut in September on Fed watch like shot up to 75% at some point, like yesterday or today or something. I just checked today. But uh, yeah, I think kind of a favorable macro environment. Like there's there can't be many surprises left, right? It seems like war was a buy. Uh, each new headline or like war type action got less of a reaction from the market. Um, I'm heavily biased and I'm always a permable, like, but yeah, I think we're through it and I think it was a buy as we said last week. You'd be happy if you buy.\n\nYeah. Nothing ever happens. It's true though. Nothing does ever happen. Like for something to happen, a lot has to go wrong. So, but this feels like the this feels like the final nothing ever happens, right? Like it feels as though the the peace deal that could come from this could be a more wide-ranging peace deal now because I think everything's on the table now, right? I think I think there's a chance that if they do a Israel does a peace deal, it'll be for, you know, for everything, and then that's like oil will go even lower. I think it is set up for a September rate cut. I don't know if the market necessarily goes up if interest rates go down. I don't know if like that is like a 100% correlation. Um, sometimes you get a little bit of wobble when you have like the we have interest rate cuts, but I just don't know what what's going to be that thing that nukes the market here.\n\nJust unseen, right? But uh, it doesn't seem like anything this summer. It's up until the right summer. Bitcoin especially is just tied to the stock market. The stock market doesn't [ __ ] go down. Obviously, that means crypto's matured and all the uh, the shitty, well, not shitty, the good speculation, like the fun times. When's that going to start again? That's really, really what people want to know. Like, Bitcoin is just like up and to the right. It's forever. Grind up, grind higher. When is the fund going to come back? When we can invest in coins and take advantage of people who don't know what they're doing by buying and selling.\n\nIt's in the stock market. It's pretty clear. I think that that like I always pick up you pick up on these narratives and you're not too sure if they're going to be a short-term one or a medium-term one. This whole like shift to trading stocks or like cryptorelated companies feels like that's what people are doing instead of old coins right now. That's just...\n\nI mean, are they these guys? Do they even know how to log in to an account and fund it, like, and do they have money in their bank account? I thought crypto people usually don't have that.\n\nI mean, that's the same with altcoins. I just feel like how how many tweets have you seen about Coinbase stock, Robinhood stock, Circle stock, and it's not the same people we see in our comment section on crypto Twitter, though.\n\nI think it is. I think a lot of it is. I I feel as though that's really taken the shine away from old coins. What do you think, K?\n\nI feel like it's in between. Like so I see a lot more of sort of like the bigger accounts or the whales or like more sophisticated, like there's sort of an entry level requirement in dollars to be trading in the stock market and making money, right? Like they're not you're not getting a 50x. And so you've seen Anom and like different guys talk about hood and like, you know, I'm tweeting about Circle a lot and these different things. Like I kind of I'm looking at all markets all the time, but I do think yeah, like KBM's right, like, you know, when are we going to get the the new hyper speculative asset class that's totally weird on chain only and like a bunch of dummies are going to pump money into something stupid, like say a cartoon in 2021 or like a memecoin last year.\n\nUm, stocks can't like yeah, the frenzy seems to be there in stocks, like, you know, Robinhood's on fire, like there's a lot of money to be made. Um, and maybe the dgens can play around with like the options, like zero days and stuff, but like they'll all just get killed. Um, I kind of do, you know, about, you know, taking advantage of people who don't know what the hell they're doing. Like I sell a lot of options on these stocks and it's been pretty good.\n\nUm, you sell?\n\nYeah, I think it's puts or you sell.\n\nYeah. Well, I haven't touched Coinbase. Like Coinbase last year, I sold a ton of puts, and then, you know, I'll take the stock and then I'll sell calls. And like right now on Circle, I'm I'm long a bunch of shares. I've short a bunch of calls at different strikes and I'm short a bunch of puts at different strikes because like the option premiums are insane. Um, Circle... and so and I aped it like day one. I was tweeting about that. That was like kind of yeah, they had to watch me. Everybody on CT told me I was a [ __ ] idiot, bro. Everyone's like, they don't make any money. They're not profitable. This is you're going to you're going to go broke, blah blah blah. I'm like for a month leading up to the IPO, I almost said ICO, but like for a month leading up, I'm like, I'm blasting this thing day one. Like I don't care what price it is. My average like 81, and I was like tweeting, I'm like, I've been top blasting this for a half an hour, and even the comments that day are like, you're dumb, c, you're dumb, you're dumb. Week later, they're like, how did you know? Is it isn't it so interesting that these guys will say that about that and then they'll buy like dog [ __ ] finance dog 75 and be like, this is going to a billion. Like the disconnect is just bizarre.\n\nBut the move the movie looks like a meme coin, right? Like that's why I kind of feel like it's Circle, like it looks like a meme coin. Well, now it has that blowoff top. Yeah, but right. It looks exactly like a meme. It had this blowoff top move and then it's kind of like it's headed back lower.\n\nIt was so liquid. It's very thin. So, that's kind of help. Feels like the same group. So, two things I want to mention here. Um, firstly was Sharp Link, which is the ETH one. That's the only one I'm kind of looking at a little bit more here. That's the one that's down 90% from its high. I just get the feeling that if they get one long-term line of capsule, that might that might move up again. That one's had a big move lower. The second thing I wanted to figure out, which I put in the in the show chat, like, have you seen SPF, like SPF, what he would have been up on his Robinhood buys? Have you seen this tweet?\n\nOh my god. No, but I I've heard about... made $4.6 six billion dollars from um from from Hood. This is after Anthropic, right? Anthropic would have been worth a few billion at this stage. Um, he Suie Suie, I believe he had like a disturbing amount of the initial uh...\n\nMan, I feel sick for him. That's crazy.\n\nIt wasn't just the soul billions, too, though. Like he had a huge soul bag they liquidated or something too, right?\n\nYeah. Cursor. Cursor AI. Like every single dev in the world is now using cursor. SPF investor in the world.\n\nThis guy may have been one of the best investors of all time.\n\nHoly [ __ ]! And he got taken down by trying to save his own [ __ ] prop fund. Like this guy could be worth a hundred billion dollars with some of these investments or altruism that could have happened.\n\nWhat do you think about this? Like is this just Did SPF just get [ __ ] here on the timing? Like it is...\n\nI think he was there too early. Sometimes you're just too early.\n\nI think he got [ __ ]. Yeah, he was too early and too aggressive. You know what? I got to hope though. He's a young guy. Like he's in prison. He's coping. Like I can't imagine it. I'm sure he's been in that position before, but it's bigger this time. I want to see him come out and make a trillion.\n\nI would invest in him, honestly. He seems like he knows what he's doing.\n\nThere was that guy back in the 80s, um, Milin, right, who did the high yield bond market. Do you remember that guy? Um, uh, what's his name? Michael Milin. Is it Michael Milin?\n\nYeah, Michael Milin, who who went to prison. Um, and then came back and is now worth 10 10 billion, right? Like went to prison for a while, but he was like a genius who like made um, yeah, made higher bonds and like various. I kind of get the feeling that you're right. He, if he gets out of prison, this guy is he's he will be a billionaire. There's just no doubt about it. Like these are crazy how good some of these investments are to get Pursu Solana, um, and Anthropic.\n\nI don't think you're gonna get a better... Did he have any elves? Like did he own anything?\n\nOh, a prison and [ __ ]. Might have been the L.\n\nYeah, I mean, I mean in the portfolio, maybe he had kind of a big L. He lost everything.\n\nUh, yeah, I don't think he had that many. I mean, you could argue that that like the Sam coins with the L, right? Like he he had a he had a like a an attraction to griffs at the same time, which and that's what got him like the like the immoral stuff is really what caught up with him, but like his ability to see value in things is also insane.\n\nOkay, DJ Tai, I'm just looking at the kick chat. His GF was kind of an L. No comment, but that made me laugh.\n\nThat's what I said. I said Catherine was the L. Gathering a few a few unrelated to investing L's. Well, sort of.\n\nBut do you think, let me just pitch this a little bit and we'll go. There is the whole like, oh, we need to like evangelize the um, the guy who created what what's the what's the website that everyone was like the the went to and he went to prison. What's his name again? The Bitcoin guy.\n\nRoss. Ross Alre. Like we evangelize Ross, like, oh my god, he did this, but like we need to get him out of prison. Do you think like we're just early to the SPF movement here? Do you think there's going to be a group like it's a bit different? Like one is perceived that he stole all the customers money and [ __ ]\n\n\n] them and everyone you know early CT guys love drugs, so they were like, \"This is my guy.\"\nYeah.\nBut was it just drugs?\nFeels like there was some other stuff going on back there.\nRight.\nIt was Silk Road.\nSorry, I forgot the It was that early CT nostalgia for Ross.\nSo SPF too late in that, but like SPF and Ross, like I like Ross, like you know, he's a legend, whatever.\nLike I think his prison ID card sold for like $11 million or some crazy number, um, like the other week.\nBut he was like, \"Yeah, maybe I'm going to get like smited for saying this, and I'm not, it's just for discussion,\" but like he wasn't really like an early crypto visionary.\nIt's not like he had the Bitcoin thesis, right?\nLike he was running like a marketplace for elicit goods.\nChad, love it.\nLike hero.\nThat's great.\nGreat business.\nAs an investor, like this this other conversation about SPF, like as time goes on, you know, two years ago, he was the guy that stole everyone's money and like blew up the biggest exchange and kind of [ __ ] everyone.\nBut now we're talking about how he was like maybe one of the best growth investors of all time and he had a crystal ball.\nYou know, what is that conversation like in 10 years?\nLike he was they're different, you know, like Ross was right place, right time, elicit marketplace happened to be a Bitcoin pioneer, but was SPF like, you know, a Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett kind of guy who [ __ ] the timing up?\nFeels like that.\nI mean, it's tough to argue with it here because it's now looking like his portfolio would be worth at least in the tens of billions, and who knows in the next 10 years, like it it it could have been something insane, which means it feels more like a liquidity issue rather than a solvency issue.\nI think that was like the main thing.\nThere's like this hole in the balance sheet before, and now it feels like that there wasn't necessarily a hole in the balance sheet.\nIt was just a need for instant liquidity to feel to because he got caught out by, you know, some of the moves, um, around there, and obviously like Binance had a part to play in like doing that, and their kind of moves with Hyperlid recently make you feel as though, you know, they're not clean, but uh, there was no doubt that there wasn't really a hole in this balance sheet if if this if this had gone on for another 12 months or maybe even six months.\nThe timing of he was like doing weird, they had no compliance, right?\nHe was like co-mingling customer deposits with like company assets, and like I don't know, the risk management seemed non-existent.\nBut yeah, if he if he could have kept it going for another like year, six months, whatever it is, like and yes, that's a good question.\nSo what do you think SPF would have bought in 2025?\nHyperlid, what's SPF?\nWhat's the SPF buying at this stage?\nI think he would have maxed the Hyperliquid airdrop at $4 when I was saying it wasn't a buy.\nYeah, probably.\nRight.\nThey probably would have bought it all.\nLike that's funny.\nI think towards the end he was bu he was building a sports book as well though, right?\nHe I think he would have probably been early to some of these sports sports betting firms, particularly in the US and stuff, prediction markets.\nI would he would have probably gone into that, right?\nYou gota you got to assume that Polymarket would would probably not be where it was today if kind of was like yeah, it was going to morph into that sort of thing, right?\nFelt that way.\nWhat do you think of this $1 billion market cap for Polymarket because I've heard anecdotally that they don't really make that much money.\nThey actually lose a lot of money on because it's like a sports book, but they're like they take a lot of the risk essentially.\nWait, why wouldn't they market it?\nNo, they actually take they they take a lot of positions.\nIt's not just fully market.\nThey directionally take positions though.\nYeah.\nSo like they I thought it was like maybe I just don't even know what's going on.\nNo, like they they provide some of the liquidity for the books.\nSo like they take the other side of some guy's bet often.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo it's not just like a like if you look at the re the revenue of that company, it's not it's not just up and the right, but but at the same time the equity value is insane, and if a bigger casino or gambling firm in the US were to buy them, like um, I think they would obviously be worth a ton.\nLike you've got to assume that somebody like DraftKings is looking at this business and thinking, \"Hey, we should we should buy.\"\nI think it's beyond that, like and I don't know, yeah, I'm probably underinformed.\nBut like that's never stopped me from having a strong opinion in the past.\nSo the reason I would say like I would buy this at a billion valuation, I probably buy as much as they let me.\nAnd the reason is because of the Twitter relationship and the Twitter integration, like which I think if they're going to go into gambling and investing or sorry, not gambling, but Twitter's going to have some kind of trading and investing like layer, and they seem to have started that with Polymarket.\nLike if you're able to take bets on events and news and political stuff and like, you know, bet directly through Twitter on Polymarket, it's worth way more than a billion.\nLike Twitter has a billion users or something.\nThat's a good point.\nI do think the value of Twitter, I mean, we've seen already this week that they're going to get into payments.\nIt does feel like this everything app has a shot at least, but an integration with Polymarket feels feels good.\nWhat what has really impressed me is that I thought it would die, not die, but like the volumes would really drop off after the election.\nAnd even this week with like what happened with like Iran and stuff, like it's crazy that like they they have done a very good job at maintaining just interest in stuff to bet in every single week.\nLike it's not just a a another way to do sports betting, right?\nIt's it's actually like it's become a bit more than that.\nIt's it's become like this um this way to bet on the news a little bit.\nLike if I go on there right now, you have the the New York City mayor elections, you have the Fed decision, and you have a decent volume going through, like $16 million just on the on the Fed decision for July.\nThere's probably real money to be made on this.\nHave you have you looked at this at all, like as like a way to make money?\nDo you think you could probably make more money on this and sometimes in the trenches?\nLike it feels as though there's some Okay, I'm not things you can do.\nIt's It's hard for me to bet on political stuff.\nLike I like it and I love to watch the markets, but like I'm not Yeah, it's not my preferred bet.\nBut I think the way I look at Polymarket is like if you wanted to express like an opinion on something through a bet and like they've got everything, like you could go Google or like you can search Polymarket for anything current events, political, like and sports, like the biggest bets I've put on Polymarket have been on Anom and Bit Boys fight because they it wasn't on any of the crypto sports books or like any of the usual sites and like right uh yeah and so but everything's always on Polymarket, and I actually hated to go use it because I don't like using Polygon at all.\nBut uh I guess you can use mainet, but I was always using it on Polygon.\nUm so yeah, I don't know.\nI think that their thing is just like coverage over everything, which I guess to your point, like if they're taking the other side of the bets half the time or sometimes they're not as profitable as they or you might think.\nYeah.\nI don't know.\nI'm not a big like probability better guy.\nI used to do this a little bit like um when maybe it was 10 years ago, and then I just stopped because I got bored with it.\nBut um I do think there's like almost a selling options bit.\nThere's similarities to this to selling options in my opinion because what I tend to find is there are a lot of things that are priced probably higher than they're actually going to happen.\nAnd yet they attract people to bet that they're going to happen because everyone's like, \"Oh, it's a 50x if it if it actually happens.\"\nDo you know what I mean?\nUm and I think most people are attracted to the upside of these trades.\nTo like the idea of a let's say a 50 bit decrease in in July from the Fed, right?\nThat's a that's a 2% odds right now on Polymarket.\nI think financial markets would put that at a 0% odds, right?\nLike they would put that a re like much lower than 2%.\nBut because there's a way to bet on that and it attracts people to do the 50x trade, um people people there's it naturally trades almost higher than it is.\nSo, I think there is almost like a way to sell options here.\nDo you know what I mean?\nLike you're selling tail.\nThat's a good point.\nBut, but yeah, like and there was one the other day where someone put a bet on it.\nYou know, I think I think uh when Jerome Powell came out and he always says good afternoon, right?\nHe always says that, and yet like it was like this crazy thing that the guy put on the bet.\nBut I actually think that's where the alpha is.\nI think people look at the 50x and think, \"Oh, that's the bet I'm going to put on.\"\nI think the alpha is doing the opposite bet, but just in quite big size basically.\nYeah, that's interesting.\nI'm thinking the opposite of what you said you think the bet is now that we had this conversation, like so I always notice on Polymarket that stuff that has like a 1% chance on Polymarket, but it might be like a conversation topic dens just chased the 50x like you said, right?\nSo like I'm trying to think of a good example, but the the mayoral mayoral candidate for New York or whatever, I think he might have just won or whatever, the socialist guy, socialist Muslim New York mayor, not to not to talk about that too much here, but his Polymarket odds were like 1% at some point.\nAnd if you were like, \"Hey, I bet this will get a lot of conversation just the like the election itself, and this guy's at 1%.\nI'm going to buy some tokens.\"\nAnd like it'll go up to 20 or something when the news is talking about it all day, and you sell it before the election, right?\nLike don't wait for the outcome, but look at the spike, man.\nLook at look at this now.\nActually, this is a really good idea.\nGo down.\nGo down right now.\nUm, they still have 22% that Eric Adams is gonna win this.\nLike a 3% that Andrew Cuomo's Quomo just conceded the race.\nDo you know what I'm trying to say here?\nIt's like why is that 3%?\nThere can't be any liquidity then.\nLike what?\nThis can't be right.\nWell, there is.\nThere is liquidity.\nThat's the point.\nSo, you're saying the race is over.\nSo, what I'm trying to say is that like I actually think the trade here is to is to go after the things that people bet on because there's a bet on, and they like the idea that it's like a 50x, and it's just the race is [ __ ] over.\nLike um and maybe you don't bet like all your money with it, but if you want a consistent way to make money, I actually think that that's the trade.\nAnd that sounds really boring, but like I just think people don't um they'll always say it's a 1% chance of anything.\nThey'll always say it's a one to two% chance of anything.\nAnd actually sometimes the odds are way lower than that.\nThey're like way, way lower than that.\nI don't know.\nSomething seems weird there.\nThere can't be that big of an inefficiency, right?\nI don't think people see it as an inefficiency, though.\nI think there's just a natural demand always to tail events in the world because people like to people just like to always bet on that.\nPeople like a binary lottery ticket, right?\nExactly.\nSo there'll be some money in there.\nYeah.\nThey'll always keep money in there because they'll always be like, \"Okay, this is that's just gambling, you know.\"\nUh because they'll be like, \"Oh, I don't mind.\nIt was a 50x.\nI lost money on it.\nWho cares?\"\nBut actually there's like a consistent way to make money, I think, by taking the other side of it and being like people people are not valuing these or are doing these probabilities right.\nThat's if I was to go to Polymarket, that's how I'd try to make money, but yeah, that's that's one way to make money, I think, in this market.\nI do think that you can make make more money than that.\nUh I think there's it's not a bad way to like consider stuff here.\nThe other thing, so in the trenches, as we went live, you were talking about this SpaceX coin.\nDo do you want to talk about that a little bit?\nLike I've only seen it on my timeline, but it's suddenly gone a bit more.\nLike this week the stuff that I've seen is house house uh chill house, which I'm kind of laughing quite a lot.\nI also laugh at Chill House.\nI don't have a bag, but it's funny.\nI I enjoy it.\nUh I've seen a little bit of this useless coin, which I I don't 140 yet.\nAnd then now there's this SpaceX stuff.\nWhat?\nTake us through it.\nOkay, I'll talk about SpaceX for a sec.\nSo, I just So, the first thing, um, I love Elon Musk.\nI used to hate him about a decade ago, but now I'm a big fanboy.\nAnd so, I get a ton of Tesla stock just because it's the only way to get Elon exposure.\nUm, and I would, you know, if if and when SpaceX exposure is available, in whatever form, I'll I'll get some.\nAnd so probably 10 minutes before the show, I started to see these tweets from like, you know, most of the big Solana Kos and like Mert, like you know, it's got a close relationship with Ti is a big like presence on Solana, and they're all tweeting about how uh I forget the company's name, man, let me go to my tweet.\nWhat is the protocol?\nUh Republic.\nOkay, so the Republic is going to have this R SpaceX token on Solana, and everybody's tweeting, you will be able to buy private equity exposure to SpaceX um with this token, which is sick.\nAnd I should say before I\n\n\nLike, say, the rest of it, I'll probably buy this thing, right? Because like perception is reality, and half the time in crypto, the thing you're buying isn't actually what you think it is. So, I'll probably buy this thing. I'm sure it's a good way to make money, but it is not SpaceX equity. And the token has nothing to do with SpaceX. Not linked to SpaceX. People like think that. People think that, bro. All the Kols are tweeting that, tweeting that. They're dumb as hell. So, what it is is it is a derivative instrument that aims to mirror the performance of SpaceX equity. Now, the issue I have with that, I'll tell you what I think is going to happen. How gonna market make what? That's what I mean. Like, there's no, there's no, like, there's no information, right? Like, how, how often do they mark to market a private, like, equity? This is just not possible for so many dumbest thing ever. Let's go along. So, what'll happen? Will it'll look like when they fractionalize crypto punks, uh, on Bitcoin, like they, like, bridged and burned a crypto punk, and then there was all these, like, little tokens. Anyway, so the sum of the tokens ended up being worth 10 times what a crypto punk was worth. And like HGA, HGE did the same thing on Soul. You know what I mean? Because like they'll, they'll put this token on Salana. There's no reference price. Like there's no some stale price for SpaceX private equity from whatever two months ago or whatever it is, wherever they get the pricing, and they can guess at whatever, but the free market on Salana will bid this thing to the sky. Um, and it'll be like, I just don't know, like, if, if it's a derivative and they're going to say it's going to mirror the performance of SpaceX, then I mean, it just sounds made up. What does that mean? Yeah, it's weird, but you're going to see it all over the timeline, like all these, all these Kols talking about how, yeah, you can buy SpaceX on Salana and stuff. So that's going to go so much higher. That is going to go so much higher. KBM, don't, don't murf this, like, right now. Is it live? Is it live right now? No, no, it's not. It's not live. Well, I better not live. I thought it was right now. Looking for it. I'm buying it, too, bro. I'm gonna buy it, but it's like, yeah, you'll be, yeah, it's, it's going to be worth way more than, or sorry, it's going to be like, have a massive premium, right? Like Master has a 2x premium to Bitcoin, and this thing will probably have a thousand x premium to SpaceX. When's it coming out? Uh, I actually don't know. I gotta see. All I did, I saw three tweets and I just wrote my own, like, FUD tweets. You gotta let us know, too, because I'll [ __ ]. Oh, you're doing, you're doing a FUD tweet to make sure you get, get a good entry. No, I, I was more doing a tweet to, like, I already did it, but I bang on tweets in eight seconds, bro. But no, just to kind of explain to people, like, hey, this is what they say it is, and this is what it actually is. I'll probably get fed for it. They'll be like, you're just fing Salonic because you like Hyperlid now. No, I'm just objective on every chain, guys. Um, I'm gonna ask Brock, when is the token coming out? I'm, I'm still scared of Salana coins ahead of Hong Fun. Like, I feel like when that thing gets launched, which could be any, any day, really, or it's going to be in the next two or three weeks, like, all of a sudden sale? Yeah, they moved it to July, like mid, mid July, I think. Feels like, I don't know. It's tough to, it's tough to, maybe this, this one will be fine, but like, I do think the Salana memecoin market gets a bad hit in the back of that. Or maybe it's already happening. Like they're down quite a lot. I guess, I think it's been, yeah, I don't even really trade Salana memes anymore, man. I just like, I've said the same thing that you got to pick if you want meme exposure, just buy Farcoin or Pangu. Like, I don't, you got to pick the multicycle coins, and then gambling in the trenches is a whole different game. I still kind of do that because it's fun, but the size is small, and like, I'm expecting to get rugged. It feels like there's like one coin every couple weeks at the moment rather than once a day. It, and even then, so what is this useless coin? Like, what? I already get the feeling it's a, it's a scam, but like, what? Tell me why it is. I'll tell you about it. Okay. Well, again, I'm like, yeah, if you made money on useless coin, you like useless coin, that's cool. I want to see everybody win. I'm not here to FUD this thing. I don't have a bag. But, uh, yeah, as like a, you know, a crypto market participant, and like I like memes, and I think that I'm, I'm a, I have a good eye for memes. And so, the first thing is it's a Bonk coin, right? Like Bonk's launchpad. And so, they launched their launchpad eight months too late. Like they got Soulport Tom. He just doesn't really seem to get it. They, they currently have a hackathon, uh, encouraging teams to, like, tag certain market cap targets and they win 200 grand. Like they're literally running a contest for scammers. Um, and so they've tried to, like, and they always use POW and like these washed, like, memecoin scammer guys to, it's just they're trying to cabal up a runner, right? Tom tweeted every single day, oh, when's the first bonk 100 million runner, blah, blah, blah. They tried it with Gibb, and then they tried it with Hosico, and like all these just tired derivative copy paste ideas, like they haven't had a single original meme. Useless isn't original either. USDU is way better. There's other coins that are way better that had the narrative first. But, uh, yeah, it's a bonkal attempt to manufacture a major runner. There's almost no organic holders, and they just kind of push the value up, and they got the same five guys tweeting about it that they had tweet about all their Cabal attempts. Um, yeah, it's a, it's a hollow Cabal crypto scam. We've seen many of these. But if you're in it early and you wrote it up, GG, like make money. But this thing is not the future if you ask me. Yeah. Like someone tried to explain it to me today. I was like, oh, you know, because it's like useless. It's like, it's like a fart coin driven. I've seen so many attempts at being like, &quot;Oh, we're going to create a coin which is so hilarious that it's like it can be worth value.&quot; Just calling it useless doesn't seem like it's really catching on. I don't know. Like I felt, I felt like Buckcoin had a much better chance than useless. Like it's, it's not, it's not funny enough just to call a coin use. No. And it's also like I call a lot of these things farcoin derivatives because it's like the derivative is like the spirit of the coin, right? Like this idea that it's like overtly hilarious. Like her dur, look it's useless. There's no point to it. Haha. Like, come on guys, we've been making this joke for a year. Like there's already been tons of coins as better ones to buy. Yeah. Like it's so, it's all tired to me, you know? And like that's a bit of mid-curving because when I knew that they were going to Cabal it, I could have just bought it and made some money. But like what I want to, fivex on this dumb coin already traded 20 things that are the same. Like there's just way more interesting stuff happening. Um, yeah. So yeah, I don't like it. I want to see originality out of these bunk guys. Like I, I tweet about this a lot. They probably hate me, but like guys, just get it together. Like you got infinite resources. You got the money to run this thing to 100 million or 200 million, whatever it is. Go pay some 15-year-old autistic DJ to make you a cool coin. I agree. I actually agree. Those guys have more money than God. Like talk about making a casino makes you money. Making a trading bot over the last two years is ungodly money. It's just [ __ ] ungodly amounts of money. Spinning up hundreds of millions on, uh, on just quite repeatable tech. It feels like, um, crazy. Photon wasn't even paying for distribution. Like if you were on a Photon ref link as a K and like I don't know how they had so many people shilling. You don't even get a share of their fees at all. You just got points for their fake airdrop that like never came and is never coming. It's just wild. And they were making like three, four million a day when like things were crazy on fees. And it's, yeah, it's very. That's a good point you make. Like Blex never did a token, right? And everyone was like, &quot;Oh, Blex token coming to Bro, I'm like I have a lot of points there.&quot; I don't think so, man. Like I, and I'm a Blex. I'm on an exclusive, brother. I need a OpenC token. I need all this stuff. Um, when what was the last one you cooked on? Blast. I don't even know. I, we co-invested giving us our coins. Wait, do we, did they [ __ ]? I think it's TGE, dude. So, I don't know. It's been TGE, but is there an unlock? Like, do we sit on coins? I don't even realize. I don't know. I feel like we should probably find out about that one. It's, it's, that's a good call. I'm glad you brought it up, but the best one I've ever done was Blur. That was good. For that one still trades at $200 million. How, I, I was looking today, like as a coin, like it's tra market cap is higher than Magic Eden. I was like, that's crazy. But Blast still is 30% of the NFT market. 30 to 40%. That is insane, right? Like I, I had no idea that they, I, I went onto their Twitter and the last thing they tweeted was like four months ago, Blast, and the last thing they tweeted was like, &quot;Hey, we're actually building something else.&quot; It was like, &quot;Okay, [ __ ] bring up, bring up the blast x account. Um, it's so they last tweeted in May, &quot;We've decided not to renew our service agreement is safe and then blast mobile.&quot; All right. Well, they areast blasting off. Whatever happened to that chick that made her whole identity glass? She gave us the hyperlid top. Yeah, brother. She pivoted to, what is her identity now? Lyel, probably. Or what is it? No, it's Hyperlid, bro. She tweeted a, she tweeted a, and she's cool. Like, I met her. She's nice. But like, man, she at the, the literal pico top tick hyperlid. Like, she tweeted this, this photo of her in a bathtub with, like, oh, yeah. Was that covering her, dude? That was the girl. Oh, man. It's not going to be the top for long. I, let's, let us pray. But, man, too perfect. I don't know. That was a pretty good run. I mean, like, I mean, yeah. I don't know. That was a pretty good run in the Hyperlid coin. I'm, I'm buy, I've been buying Hyperlid in this period. I've actually been putting on, this is why I mentioned, I, I mentioned that we should try create our own Hyperlquid Vault because I've been doing, I've been doing this myself a little bit. Oh, wow. What happened? What happened? No, she's got a different account. It's like DJ Jen or something. Maybe this is her old one. I remember. Oh, yeah. You were thinking about doing a vault, Mando, right? Yeah, because I was like, I'm doing this now. Like I've gone long, hype, Bitcoin, ETH, um, and what else did I go long? Uh, SPX actually went long and Ave, and I'm sure a bunch of dog trash. Like absolute trash. Um, but mainly it's, it's Bitcoin and hype and a little bit of E. But I, uh, I think a vault is so cool. We should create a vault, and then just that this might be quite fun each week to see how it's done. Um, because I think, uh, it'll all be public. I can run it. I can run it. You guys can, uh, I can have my own little hyperlquid, uh, fund that you guys can all invest in hedge fund. Yeah, I'll invest in it. I love it. Like I, I love the idea of a wrecked radio vault. Like I love the concept of the vaults in general. It'll take a long time for this to get, like, the traction that I hope it eventually gets. I'm like full bull hyperl, like, you know, how's all financial markets on hyperl liquid eventually be like 10 years, like, who knows? I'll, I'll have taken a lot of profit before they get to the dream, but like, you know, I spent, I, I worked in banking for a long time, like I worked in asset management, like traditional hedge, hedge funds, two and 20, like 99.9% of potential investors are like screened out because they're not accredited. Like I want to see a 15-year-old DGEN in a hoodie, complete anon, amass a billion AUM on hyperlquid in a vault and outperform Wall Street. Like I just want to see, yeah, I love the concept. Maybe, maybe that's what we should do because we, we spoke about creating a Bitcoin treasury company. Pomp just raised a billion dollars for his. Um, maybe this is our play to, to cash in on the ever growing value of Rekt Radio. And, uh, OSF really did, was it, was a good showing from him again. Turn up halfway through. Uh, yeah, you lied to us again. I mean, like, bro is about to be fired. Is he, does he get any equity in, in the hyperlquid vault? I feel like, uh, I feel like he's putting as much equity.\n\n\nAs I got and wrecked in the hyperlid vault. Zero.\nYou got you got a you got some free drinks three months too late. Unfucking unbelievable. Should we start running the lamb shop stuff or what are we thinking now?\nUh no. I think well maybe we do it in five minutes. Five minutes.\nYeah, whatever. Let's keep running it then. Hyperlquid vault.\nYeah. I think um I'm trying to think what else we can like we're making money on this week. The I guess some of these dead chains rallied like that coin that that say thing went up like [ __ ] 2x. That was like a big move.\nThat was crazy.\nYeah, I was surprised about that. I think that's just because everyone was short it rather than like it was necessarily that much value. There's some talk about jump crypto coming back into crypto. I don't know if you guys have seen this and that this is a jump cryptocoin and they're doing the same thing with and a few other ones. So like maybe pay attention to what jump it feels like they're going to do a DWF crime season here on their return back into crypto. So like people are well jump you know the market maker they've come back into crypto. That's this coin. Obviously, this is a jump crypto coin apparently. So, there's there's an idea that they're gonna like any piece of like rough news about one of their coins, you're going to see like DWF style candles. You know, there was that period for a while where it was like, oh, it's a DWF coin. Like, we could get a period here where you're going to see it's a jump crypto coin. So people are like following their portfolio a little bit more and um be wary of like shorting anything that goes up like 100% which which they're involved in because they're probably the ones they're probably on the ones pushing it. Other than that, yeah, Hyperlid was had a kind of a a nothing week. Feels like Bitcoin is the only thing that like you can just bet every week it's going to go higher. Ethan sold kind of a bit a bit of nothing. the trenches.\nTrenches didn't really make that much money. It's been Yeah, definitely quite a weak. Maybe it is just um Maybe it is just onchain gambling that we uh we have to make money on.\nYeah, I mean there's not what do you guys trade for fun or gamble or like you know I used to I used to be just like trenching and flipping meme coins and like doing that week to week dayto day and it was the it was the high volume sector where it was pretty easy to make money and it was extremely active and now for months it's like I don't make a lot of trades and I've probably well not probably in the last three weeks I've made more trady trades than I have in crypto and I've just been kind of holding Bitcoin DCA hyperlquid like I'm so onchain I'm not really doing anything interesting are you guys for the last two months I I've I've done a few different things right like I've done I've had some big positions on I had a big position in ETH which we did relatively well and then I moved to this like right I'm going to actually do like a long short portfolio here the actual thing that's made easily the most money for me is um is like algo like AI trading bots, which I put quite a lot of money in a couple months ago. Um,\nhas it been working, brother? Like the best ROI possible.\nAnother thing that one of my buddies tells me, you [ __ ] tipped me off on that like a year ago.\nAre you investing in the bots or you're giving the bot money trading for you? What?\nSo, so I've been there's a platform I use which is called three commas which is relatively well known in crypto. Um, but there's another of other ones. I I checked out a few of them. I forget the name of some of them, but like just do some research yourself into different firms who kind of do this a little bit. And some of them are quite basic, but like Grid Bots where like they'll just buy and sell for you and they trade the volatility. And obviously, we've gone sideways for a little bit here, so like it's been relatively good. But I I put on AI trading bots in like Bitcoin, ETH, um Pepe, and um what was the other one? No, I think it was those three like decent size and easily I've made easily the most money on that stuff than I have on anything else and barely barely any ever draw downs like anything significant. Um that's cool. I gotta look into that.\nYeah, it's because then you just also what I tend to find is I make the worst decisions when I just have money in stables or money just in something which I don't consider to be like high risk. So like this just locks it up because it's kind of annoying to put it on and but once it's on, you just don't really think about it and it's just like running in the background. It's almost like a it's like an S&P portfolio. Do you know what I mean? Like it's just there.\nAnd No, I know what you mean. And I know what you mean about like making bad decisions when like not bad decisions but sometimes I'm like idle hands. I'm bored and I'll like find a trade like you know okay I got to look into that and you you get too big in it and then you're like oh you know this was actually a bad idea like I should have done that and and for me putting money in this and I I've I've you know I've put mid7 figures in this stuff now and and done way better than me doing some of the other stuff I've been doing and way less stress. I just don't even think about it. It's just it's just there.\nUm that's sick.\nSo the the best firms I've seen for it because you can do this in stocks too a little bit right now. Like I do think the the de the democratization of algo trading for retail with now all these new AI models is here, right? like what what used to be given to like three sigma or like these these like incredible AI trading f hedge funds of the past like you're going to be able to do with these chat chat um with these like chat GBT and some of these AI models in seconds now and that you can now do it with stocks as well as crypto I think like there's there's another one which I saw um a crypto AI trading B. Let me see if I can find the one that I was looking at which looked interesting. Um, Intellectual Intellectia AI. I looked at this for a long time. Um, this is like built into the stock market as well. But like I do I think a lot of this stuff is going to become very popular and it's not it's not it's not the shitty ALGO that used to be sold 1015 years ago. They're pretty complex now and they they probably replicate some of the some of the kind of advanced ones that hedge funds are running for for a while. So like I think there's some value in that.\nThis is cool.\nSo like three commas.io is this the one and they like they run your exchange account.\nYeah. You just you have an API into your Binance account.\nUm Cool.\nAnd uh your futures account and it just trades it for you basically. Uh sick. How long until it's like robots fighting robots and it's just about your edge is now finding the newest best robot? I know they're not robots. I just call them robots.\nI think it's kind of there like you you add the nuance of hey these are the things I think are going to do well versus not. So like if you are for example that guy who did the hyperlquid bolt if you're like I'm bullish on hype and bitcoin and maybe a couple other things you could run a long bots on those things. And if you're short on all the high FTV scam coins, you could run short bots on the other things. And actually, you'll probably trade you you'll make like extra 50 60% return here just just on the trading because it trades volatility in that stock as well, right? Like it keeps a position but but trades the volatility.\nUm, which in crypto is like is a feature. It'll it's just always going to be there. So like having something that you can just leave and you know it's trading for you. I I found it really helpful for me just as a trader like to like be able to switch off a bit more.\nNice. Yeah, that's super interesting. We should look at um or I should uh let's get on to the lamb chop fellas.\nYeah, let's do lop.\nLet's go.\nWhat do we got? Let's go. Roll the names. So let's get these names out.\nLuck. I have 70% RTP by the way. Yeah, those those figures are wild.\nAt least 94. But anyway, here we go.\nGio.\nOh, wow.\nNice.\nI like the pace.\nIf this one starts with a G, it's rigged.\nYeah.\nLet's go.\nAll right. All right. Let's [ __ ] run it. I'm sure. So, we're all running it for We're all running it again. Each one we run it for. Yeah. Whoever.\nSo, who was first last time?\nYou were first last time. G you want to do Gio Joel?\nYeah. Coup goes first last\nOh, yeah. I went last last time. Who am I? I got\nSo, what did we do? $1,000,000.\nWe got 500 in the bank. So, like they've got some money in the bank for 1,000.\n500 in the bank. Now, it's just to play for a thousand.\nAll right.\nPlayed it conservative and got killed last time if you were watching. Let's Let's see how he does this time.\nHere we go. Okay.\nWell, I'm going to be like, yeah, I got to assume that this is meaningful money to the guy and so I want to help him out.\n500 bucks for just sitting there.\nHe's got 500.\nOkay, we'll see how I'm feeling. Okay, go. Go for the first one.\nNice frog down.\nOh. Oh god.\nYeah, kick him. That's a good sign on the first one.\nThat was crazy. Okay, go again.\nOkay, go again.\nSo, he's got what? No, that was the same creep.\nWell, one day I'm gonna hit the casino.\nAll right, I'm lucky in this thing.\nAll right, let's go. Uh I I'm going to play a little bit more risky, so let's go.\nGo.\nI'm at least getting to the tree. All right, so keep going.\nOh my god.\nOh my goodness.\nDay. Who am I playing for?\nWe got to play this one safe.\nSmart Den, I believe.\nSmart Den.\nSmart Den.\nOh my god. If I got killed on the first one, I was going to be so tilted.\nIt's not that difficult to reach the All right, play. Let's Let's have a winner here, KBM.\nNo. Are you kidding me?\nEverybody, bro, he was I thought he was going to win at all. Personally, I don't know. They all won 500 bucks. Should we do one more and split between them? If we w if see see how far we go.\nYeah, but how are we going to decide when to stop?\nWe'll split between them. We'll split between them equal.\nBut I just like clicking the button like I'm trying to go all the [ __ ] way.\nLike I'm trying to get that.\nDo a split one till like the at least tracks.\nLet's see if we can try and get to the train tracks.\nWe'll try and get to the train tracks or nothing. Okay, chat. Okay.\nOh my god, we're getting out. The wolf is hungry today.\nAll right, one more.\nI'll just click it.\nOne more. One more.\nTake us to the [ __ ] train tracks.\nCome on. Come on. Here we go, fellas.\nThere you go. It's gonna happen.\nI'm going to click it. This is for splitting it.\nWe did it.\nYou want to keep going or no?\nI mean, obviously I want to keep going, but like I have like\nNo, that's that this is a win for everyone. We We gave out some money in the chat.\nIt feels like it's going to stop at 7,200.\nWell, if you if you do I I don't want to. Yeah, if you do one more, they all get a thousand, right?\nOh, wow. That's one.\nOh, yeah. I would quit now.\nCash. Cash. Cash. Cash. They got a thousand. They all got 1,500. That's a nice That's a nice run.\nOh my goodness.\nOh my god. I'm a loser. Sorry. But no, it's still a big win, boys, to the listeners. Smart D and then Gio and Dow.\nOh my god.\nJust give them all a thousand each though. And plus the 500. They all win 1500 today.\nAll 1500. You guys all win 1500. Um\nOh my god, bro. I'm like I'm I need to log off. I'm addicted to playing this. So I'm got to get out of this account.\nYeah.\nAll right. Um great show.\nI enjoy these shows. This has got a good energy to it. Uh, everyone get involved.\nHopefully OSF doesn't ruin the vibe next week. Let's see.\nI'm worried. So coming.\nI think he's even coming. He probably was [ __ ] call.\nAll right, guys. Well, this was episode, what was it? 110. Um, remember we give out prizes to everyone who follows us on Kick.
