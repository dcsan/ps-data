  "cleanText": "I think as people are going on the spaces live, but we're doing a slightly different format. We're thinking, um, maybe four co-hosts now. Uh, Cook is going to be joining us, um, as kind of a permanent co-host. We're thinking for the foreseeable future, unless, let's go.\n\nUm, and we're just going to kind of keep it a bit more views-based, a bit more interactive with the audience, less guests. We kind of felt like the guest interviews was really me just interviewing a guest and then OSF eating a sandwich in the background. So, we're going to kind of just change it up a little bit, have, uh, have some views on stuff of the week, and we kind of feel like Cook is one of the best people to have that going forward.\n\nOSF, unfortunately, is on a flight to LA for the Rekt event today. Likely story. So, a great first week for him. Uh, but it's great to have you, Cook. Um, if you're, by the way, we are also on Kick, so go check us out on Kick. All video for the show going forward will be on Kick. We will also be linking the prizes at the end of each show. Remember, we're giving out nearly $5,000 a show to people. Um, so huge, huge show in terms of prizes. If you follow us on Kick and you have signed up to eat under the wreck radio account, we'll pick someone from there. Um, but yeah, Cook, great to have you. Uh, we turned you from a regular guest into a bit of a co-host. So, um, great. Yeah, great.\n\nI love it. I'm extremely happy to be here. Thanks for letting me hide behind the cartoon. Um, it's a little awkward with like the body language cues, but I'll figure it out. But, uh, no, this is really cool because I used to host the spaces like peak bare market when there was nothing going on and I just wanted to stay close to crypto. I hosted spaces every morning for like an hour or two and I really missed being able to talk about crypto. Like all spaces were just kind of garbage and I don't know. I tried to host one focused on crypto and markets and, uh, yeah, you guys are like the goats, right? So, you're very smart and like it's cool. I'm excited to talk about everything, uh, regularly. Very cool. Yeah, me too. I'm actually, I'm actually, we were talking about in the back.\n\nThat's me. Sorry. Um, we were talking about in the back that we just like, we prefer this sort of a show. Like it gets us a bit more talking about the stuff of the week. So, I think that's what it's going to be. I think the first stuff really to talk about is kind of what's going on in markets at the moment, which is this Israel, Iran, War, uh, will they, won't they sort of drama going on. Um, feels like crypto is just getting nuked, uh, metaphorically versus everything else. Like macro is not really moving. Gold hasn't really moved. It's just altcoins which are getting smashed lower. Bitcoin dominance up to 65%. Like what do you think of all this? Do you think this is just always by war in crypto? Like a man, I'm a I'm a permable, like just by nature. Um, and I'm I'm mostly like just kind of a long only trader. And so yeah, and I I always think war is bullish just like for a few reasons. The headlines are going to create dips. It's a buying opportunity. They're going to print money, right? Like war means money printing and debasement and so Bitcoin will go up a lot, stocks will go up a lot. Time frame uncertain. So I like for me it feels like most of the headline risk is over. Like we've probably seen the worst unless something crazy happens. But in that case I say just buy the dip anyways. Will I try to like time a short or anything like that? That's not really my style of trading. But I'm optimistic and I think again I'm always biased on this kind of stuff like but FOMC's today, right? Like what, two hours or something, and we're going to get a dot plot and like there's all this mayhem in the world, so he's got to be dovish, right? Like the press conference is probably going to go well. I don't know, like I'm again, I kind of, I'm not making massive trades around this. I just take entries on stuff I want to own anyways when the headlines create the volatility, which I think the worst is passed if I'm going on what Trump, like Trump likes to make a deal. I don't know if it escalates in this period where he's now saying, \"Oh, there could be a deal.\" Like I feel as though they'll still be like them trading missiles and stuff, but I feel as though you've at least got a period here where probably it doesn't escalate for a few days and, um, I think it could.\n\nYeah, we could have a little bit of a rally. I, you know what I've been doing recently though? I've literally just been going on to Poly Market. This is a bit of Alpha, I think. Yes. Poly market each morning, actually get a much better [Â __Â ] view about the probability of stuff happening versus not. It's still a 61% chance of US military action against Iran before July. So, it's still like kind of in this 50/50 odds. On the comments earlier, it went down to like 48%, but then it's gapped back up. So, wasn't it like 80 yesterday? It went. Did it go down today a bit? It went to 75, I think, at one stage yesterday. So yeah, this is towards the highs, not at the highs, but like they definitely still feel like something's going to happen. And I think they are, they are, um, they're evacuating some of the bases. But like even on that headline, even on that headline of, oh, bomb gets dropped. Do you think it's just like everyone just buys that dip? I think so, man. Okay, one would think so. I don't know. Uh, not to like, I don't know, make light of the issue or anything like that, but like, does it really change much for the global economy if Iran has military action occur in its, its, uh, country? Doesn't really feel like it. I think it's just like short-term, you know, quick headlines bounce. I don't know what, like, who's going to get involved? Is China get involved on their side? Highly doubtful. Iran, Iran is 3% of the global oil supply, about 10% of its gas, but it all goes oil. It barely goes. It barely goes anywhere else but China right now. So, it really just affects those two and, and if they were to like escalate it, it would really just be if they close that waterway, which is a straightforward move. I don't think they'd do that because it would just hurt China again. So, like I, I kind of just feel as though, I, I don't think it's going to be this, this terrible thing where like oil goes to like 120 or No, it's just it's all [Â __Â ] just short-term nonsense.\n\nGerations. Yeah. So, I think most. Yeah. Nothing ever happens, but then it kind of happened this time. I do just think that most people who are even bearish are just like you're bearish on the headline and then you're meant to buy the headline. I feel like quite a lot of de-risking has happened. Like I don't know. Feels like people have panicked enough about this.\n\nYeah. I think it's pretty safe to buy. If there's any significant dip, you should be buying it for sure. I mean, like, if it happens on a Friday, though, obviously they have to deal with like low liquidity weekend type [Â __Â ]. Um, might chicken you out, but I think, yeah, the only trades that are to be had are buying a dip here. It's not really shorting. Uh, shorting doesn't seem like it's the play. Yeah, James Whim thinks we're going to 90 to 95. So, Wow. Okay, never mind. Then shorting is definitely the play. All you got to do is counter trade James, bro. Galaxy brain. This guy's a [Â __Â ] genius. So, never mind. The Matrix will hunt him every time. Oh my god, this guy. It's so funny. Did you see it's actually insane?\n\nDid you see that tweet thread where they like exposed him for like having the other side of his trades and then you, when you got to the end of the expose, it was like he lost a hundred million rather than 105 million. Like they were like he didn't have it the other side. Like is that actually true? I don't think so. He was back to backing, but it was like it, he made like five million off the back 40x [Â __Â ] paying spreads. Like 40x leverage spread paying isn't like you can't, the guy's literally just a [Â __Â ].\n\nI've been there. I'm like throwing stones in glass houses, obviously, but I can do that. I don't have any walls left, so it doesn't really matter. We, we get him on. We've got to get him on, I think. Yeah, he won't respond to my DMs. Try to get him a YEET balance. I try to do a lot of.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThat's how we beat the luck.io. Um, yeah, I think I think the, I agree with you. I think I, I've hedged a little bit. I actually saw a tweet that you made earlier this week, Cook, which made me think a lot and it's a strategy I've been doing for the last month or so. Everyone loves to short Bitcoin and ETH or like they like to short like these L1s. I just think there are so many better coins to hedge your longs with in crypto. There's so many coins out there not rally and go to zero. And you've highlighted a really good thing on Hyperliquid, which is just go long Bitcoin and HYPE and you can have a view on HYPE or whatever, but like and then short the high FDV low float coins which are just dumping on you. I've been doing that for the last couple of months and I've been [Â __Â ] cooking on this as a strategy. I feel like it's done very well the last couple of months because Bitcoin dominance has gone higher. But is that just not the trade? Like why even be short Bitcoin? Like who cares? Like just be short like Sooie or be short like, I don't know, like some of this other stuff which is just like 200 million of of, um, of like token token supply each month on on the token. There's so many crazy coins like that. Yeah, I think you got to be crazy to show to short Bitcoin. I got to find this guy that's a user vault like that thing on HYPE. That's one of the 50 reasons I'm super bullish on HYPE. Uh, yeah, long BTC and HYPE short garbage is the name of the vault. And I think now it's the vault outside of the HLP, like the liquidity provider vault. It's the highest AUM vault on Hyperliquid. But yeah, the guy, I, I can't now find his name and I forget, but shout out to the guy running it because when I posted about it, he's in my comments and he's like ex-private equity. He's got big long posts like updates on, obviously this is all like completely unregulated and he's taking the approach that he wants to take because he's like passionate about it. But I mean he's running the thing a bit like a hedge fund manager and he gives these updates on X and like it's pretty cool. Like I don't know. I, I really like the long-term implications of this kind of thing. Sorry, what's his handle? You know, I'm trying to find it. I'm just scrolling on my Twitter, but, uh, yeah, I'll find it. He's sorry.\n\nYeah. What's, what's his name? Because I've been thinking about this for a while.\n\nWhat's it? Kan Crypto. Ki San. His display name is Ken.hyperliquid.hl. Kan_.\n\nYeah. He's got, he's got 4,000 followers and he's got a pin post from January 21st where he like, it's, it's a six-part thread on his valuation framework for Hyperliquid and I mean he was right as [Â __Â ]. So he's pretty smart guy. So he's short, to be clear, audience, he's given it. You can see what he shot. He short Sooie. He shot Avax. He shot Link. He shot Ton, Kaio, Trump, Ada, Alt, Doge, Popcat, Ship, Har. I would actually never short the memes because I just like I can never judge that. But I've been going through, do I did basically the same analysis and I was like the ones that look crazy to me. Um, Sooie, Sooie is one, right? Like if you look at the the tokconomics of that thing, it's, it's like insane. The other ones that really stand out like Onondo. I don't know if you seen Ono, but this thing trades at like 8 billion and is an RWA chain, whatever that kind of means. They have some TDR, but I don't know how that trades where it does. And then I was actually short a lot of this Story Protocol. I don't if you like remember this thing. It's down. It's down like, uh, 20% today, but like that was trading at five billion. I was like, what, what is this stuff? But there is, I had never heard of that. I literally had never heard of that and I saw a tweet from Cirrus or Cyrus, um, saying, \"Hey, like you should check this everyone. You might get an airdrop.\" And like I got poor grand and instantly dumped it. Had never heard of Story Protocol. Don't know what IP is. Never heard of it again. I don't know how these things have the valuations they have. But I think it's a really good time to do those shorts by the way on those coins because you've seen over the last couple of weeks, right? You or even the last couple of months we had that Mantracoin that went to like zero. There was one this week, ZKJ, I think it was the ticker, like which dropped 80% on Binance and everyone was like, okay, this is a scam. There's been a couple of other ones like Polyhydra, I don't if you saw this one, Polyhydra dropped 80%. So these coins, it's down, yeah, 80% on the week, it was trading at two billion and now it's trading at 400 million. So these coins, why does it trade where it does? I actually think it's a good time to trading because I think these market makers are getting called out by Binance or by the exchanges a bit more and they're just like getting out.\n\nYeah, I think I don't know. I, the wheels fell off of this like heavily VC-backed retail TGE dump scam of like vapor tech that's never going to get users.\n\n\nOr make any money. This is part of the reason I love Hyperliquid so much. I talk about it way too much, but like Hyperliquid is the first fair launched, totally egalitarian thing since Bitcoin. Um, excluding some memes, I guess, but you know, there's no VCs to dump on you. There's 38% of the supply that's left to be distributed to the community and users, like, however they see fit. I just like the ethos of it. It's a long conversation, but it's the complete antithesis of all these like VC garbage vaporware chains. And that scam used to work, like, in 2017, 18, and then, like, it worked again through DeFi, and, like, you know, I think it's finally stopping working. I, I don't think it's going to stop this stuff from coming out, but, like, yeah, I don't know, these weird chains pop up and die faster than they used to. I just hate all this stuff. I'm, yeah. So, touching on that a little, a little bit, because I think that was another topic we wanted to go to, like, Hyperliquid just as a trade. It feels as though it's been a great trade, and, like, it's a very difficult chart to buy into because it's just, like, you just, it is just up and to the right, barely any dips. But then this week we saw, and we've seen quite a few different places now announce, like, per in the US, um, like, a move almost like decentralized trading by bits launched to DEX or per DEX. What, what, what do you think? Is this the time to, like, to, to question it, or I saw you put a tweet out earlier, it's time to go even more long? I'm so bullish on Hyperliquid, bro. I might be wrong, but, like, I don't think so. Like, we're going to see. And so when the airdrop happened, like, I wish, I mean, I guess they had to start with a perex. I'm not going to question, like, how they built it and how they started. But I, I did not look at Hyperliquid early, and I remember Whiz was farming it, and, like, he, or maybe not even purposely farming it, but he used to use it, like, even a year ago, year and a half ago, and he put up a P&L card on TWITTER here and there, and I don't really trade per, like, so I was like, \"Oh yeah, that's cool. Like, another perex. Let's see.\" And I was actually advising for a protocol called Wasabi. They ended up winning, like, one of the top blast prizes. Like, they had a little HYPE for a while. It was an onchain per deck, but there was so much behind Hyperliquid I didn't see, and I never looked at, and I ended up, my first buy, and I even shout out to Rasmir and Frank DGODS, but I was talking to them in a chat around when Hyperliquid came out, and they were like trading pers and stuff, and I, this is where, like, sometimes 20 IQ wins. Not saying they're necessarily 20 IQ, but they're like, \"Oh, you know, people are going to stop trading memes and just move to Hyperliquid and trade per.\" And I'm like, \"I don't think that's going to happen.\" And one of them was like, \"Oh yeah, I should just all in it at, like, $5.\" And I'm like, \"I don't know. That's crazy.\" But I hadn't looked at it, right? I didn't know what it was. And so I started to think about it more and take a really close look at it, like, I don't know, two, three months ago, four months ago, whenever the sexes started attacking it. And, like, Binance and KCoin, and, like, they all, they manipulated, um, Jelly, Jelly, and HYPE went from, like, 30 something dollars. I, I don't know what it was at that day, but, like, in a day or two, it went down to $14, and, uh, cuz they manipulated Jelly, Jelly, and they actually had to, like, roll back the chain or do something weird with the oracles and get all the validators to agree and stuff. Anyways, I was like, to me, I was like, wait a second, like, if Binance wants to kill this thing so bad, it's got to be really important. And so I just bought, like, a decent bag and started to, like, figure it out more. And then where I'm at now is basically this Jeff guy. Like, if you look into, not this Jeff guy, all due respect, the guy's like a god. He's like the living Satoshi of markets or something, like, but he's got this crazy background, and he, if you read his really long post, that was another thing that clicked for me. There's been three or four things, but he's got this long, long post from a month ago or six weeks ago. Um, he talks about transparency in financial markets and how every, at a reiteration of, like, the progression of financial markets, people think it's bad and they fight it and whatever, whatever, but now, like, Hyperliquid's goal is to bring everything on chain, fully transparent, real time, and all this stuff, and I don't necessarily have to understand it, but I've always been, like, a buy management kind of guy, so that strengthened my view of the trade, but anyways, you got this thing that was completely fair launch. It makes more money than everything in crypto. They have zero VCs by design. They've given all of the tokens that have been distributed have been distributed to users and community on, like, uh, you know, a fair basis based on, like, who did what on the chain. They started, they, they built the chain or, like, the, the Hyperliquid ecosystem. It's kind of two chains, right? But they built it from the inside out. Like, all these [Â __Â ] are out there, like, Field of Dreams, right? Monad isn't even a real thing. That's stupid. They're, I did a tweet the other day of the Chinese switchboard. That's the Monad community. And then in the middle, you got maybe, like, a mega ETH, where they have cool tech. No, man, three, three years, it's not out. It's crazy. They, they got a test net, I think. But, like, it's basically Field of Dreams is the old approach in crypto where, like, if you build it, they will come. And so Mega Esau is like, \"Oh yeah, you know, we got the fastest thing, and we're focused on builders, and so, because our chain is so fast, we're going to get the best stuff built on it.\" I mean, that's kind of, you look at what Hyperliquid did. They just built the best thing that progressed crypto and markets. And the proof of that is that it makes the most money of anything in crypto. And then from that, they just, like, Do you think Pump Fun has got a shot then? Like, I think, Oh, bro. Pumpfunnel do a chain, and people are saying four billion valuation is crazy. I think that you're crazy if you think 4 billion valuation is crazy, cuz I mean, you know, the guys from one side of the War, and the people on that side are smart and clever, and you know, rubbing their hands together and [Â __Â ] the founder. I don't want to get too racist, but no, it was supposed to be a joke, but, uh, no, look, I think that what they will do, and if I was them, and if Allan, you're listening, you should give me some money for this, but, uh, yeah, launch a chain. He won't give it to me because of what I just said, but they should launch a chain and compete with traditional web two streaming businesses. They're trying to push their ways into crypto, right? Like, Cake's going to do some crypto stuff. Rumble, Rumble will do crypto stuff. Twitch is the dinosaur that won't do it, and it'll end up being the thing that kills them. But Pump Fun can go eat all their lunch, right? Like, they should do a chain and be the cryptonative streaming service and get FaZe and all these other clowns. Like, I don't watch that form of entertainment, but I don't need to. All the kids are going to watch it. We chose to do it on kick. So, like, this has been a bit of a shift for us to do it on kick, but, but we could have done it on pump. We just kind of felt like kick was was better, better for now, but they have a shot. I do think they have a shot. When pump does a chain, you move it to the pump chain for sure. Like, if they, and they should do that. And that's Hyperliquid's was like, they did the streaming and chain first and didn't really talk about it and dropped it overnight. Like the equivalent, right? Like, they did the massive curve decks and then they added the spot market and then they added the EVM, which is like, they didn't talk about it. It was just wake up one morning and HYPE has hyper EBM. I love this, bro. Do you know hyperunit? Like, are you, you know what this tech is? It's like a ecosystem builder. So on Hyperliquid, it's like, it completely replaces sex. Like, you, you just send in native soul fart coin or ETH. They're going to add more assets, seamless, instant. It's in your Hyperliquid. You can sell it. Like, it's crazy. It's, it's really crazy. This is this one. I have, I have seen this. This, this is, um, I, I love that tweet the other day where, like, they took out Iran's oil fields or whatever it was. These are the things that you could do on Hyperliquid to get back the the revenue. All right, so here's a question. Here's a question. Um, is this a better long than Bitcoin now? You think, like, because I think right now this could, this is now going to flip Solana, right? Well, you've seen the three treasury companies already, right? Like, two of them are a bit, one of them's a bit of a joke, one of them's not, and then one of them is big. This is like an opthalmologist buying some crypto. It looked like I saw the, no, there's a, but there was a new one today. So, there was the first guy was Tony G, and he's just some guy that has, like, a public company on the TSX. Like, that's the joke one, right? The [Â __Â ] poker player. Tony G. Tony G. Yeah, Tony G. He's changing his, his company's name. They already filed for it, and it's going to be called Hyperliquid Strategy, and he bought, like, whatever, there was a press release last week. He bought some HYPE, and he's gonna have it staked and everything. And then there's the eye company that's that's doing it. But then there's a big one, like, I just tweeted about it. Uh, and they're buying a lot of HYPE, dude. I like, just let me get it right. Yeah. LGHL secures $600 million facility to launch Hyperliquid Treasury. That was today, two hours ago. We got a lot going on with you and and whatever, but, like, should we not be doing this, guys? Should we not be just be doing, like, with a new look radio, publicly listed company on the NASDAQ and just buy random things? Like, feels like we, I mean, everyone else is doing it, and his friends don't see how this ends well for anyone, but let's find out. Why do you think people are so crazy about this stuff, KBM? Like, a bunch of literal morons who don't know what they're doing stocking their treasury with super volatile assets. You think that's good? It's going to work. I think it's good for the people get rich. I think it's good for the people who create it and then sells equity is what I'm saying. Yeah, but they're all just going to get rich. Like, all these companies are just never going to go down. It's just, I think the people buying the stocks are the people that won't make money. But the people creating treasury is mine. That's basically where I'm at. Yeah. Well, yeah. Sailor, it took me a long time to understand Sailor's business model. Probably because it's so stupid, but it's also so genius. But, like, this idea of Bitcoin arbitrage, like, he sells a billion dollars worth of, like, fake securities and he buys Bitcoin and he, like, gets arbitrage in the middle, right? Like, if he's selling, if he's selling equity and it's backed by a certain amount of Bitcoin, it's like, but he gets, I don't know, whatever, it's backed by 200 million of Bitcoin and he sells a new trench of equity for a billion and then he buys a billion of equity. Like, his contention is that he made $800 million. Yeah. Like, that's his whole, like, Bitcoin yield thing, right? It's like an endless flywheel of, but he kind of did it. Like, I agree with KBM. All these other companies, a lot of them will probably go down, and it's going to be tons of scams, but, like, Sailor kind of found the only infinite money, and the guys, Yeah, it's crazy. And these guys, like, Udy and David Hoffman and stuff, like, they're talking about this a lot. They did Kindly MD, like that. I think that was the UK one where they, like, turned it into a BTC treasury company. They seeded it for a million dollars or something, like, or, or got voting control. I don't know what they did. It was a million into a hundred million or something crazy. That David Bailey guy said he put a million dollars into, he put into MetaPlanet, right? He owns 1% of MetaPlanet. Metaplanet. It's worth, like, a hund00 million. So, like, yeah, it does feel slightly, and we were going to talk about this anyway, but, like, we kind of missed the boat on that. Like, we were all stuck in the trenches in Q1, and then everyone kind of thought everything was dead, and what actually just happened is people just made ungodly amounts of money in the public markets with this sort of [Â __Â ]. Like, I made a trade on a couple of them. Canor, I had, I don't hold any of them anymore. Like, I hold Micro Strategy just because I like Sailor. But, uh, yeah, Kindly, I made a little trade, and Cantor, I made a little trade. That was that's Nakamoto. But, yeah, I wouldn't hold any of this stuff long term. And I had a really long conversation with Brock about how to do this myself. It's too hard. But you should do it. That was the real, the real trade. Maybe Rekt Radio becomes a publicly listed company and we, uh, we put some [Â __Â ] in there. I think, I think the biggest ones, obviously, for Bitcoin. There's a, there's a bunch of them. There's way more for Bitcoin. For, for Solana, we actually had them on a different show. Um, Defi Development Corp have a five billion dollar line for Solana. And then you have ones for HYPE Now. And then you had that one for ETH, but they kind of semi-rugged it. Um, which kind of shows HYPE makes more sense though. Like, that's the only one I can see as a long-term treasury asset other than Bitcoin is HYPE. And I'm massively biased. Like, and yeah, what you said about is, is HYPE a better long than Bitcoin. I don't know. Like, I, I still,\n\n\nI have way more exposure to Bitcoin than HYPE, but HYPE is my second biggest crypto holding.\nAnd there's just Have you seen this HIP3, like HYPE improvement protocol or whatever?\nThis is what a wrong.\nI don't know that much about it.\nLike I don't because I don't read stuff, right?\nLike I just kind of like sparse some tweets and talk to people.\nI expose myself a bit.\nBut what it is basically is if you buy a million HYPE and stake it, then you can launch, like, in a decentralized, permissionless fashion, you can launch your own perp market.\nAnd I don't know the intricacies of how you do that, but you could like put an asset onto Hyperliquid and you own the market.\nYou've launched it and you earn like 50% of the fees and and there's controls and safeguards and whatever.\nThese guys are very smart.\nLike you just have to believe that part when you're talking to me because I can't explain it.\nBut yeah, that's the basic premise is that this will allow an entity or a group or a person who stakes a million HYPE to launch their own perp market.\nYou can do this on so so the ways I've seen this before is there was the asset JLP, which I think me and you spoke about a number of times, but like, um, Jupiter allowed you basically to do and you basically just put in stables, Solana, Bitcoin, ETH, and you basically got exposure to those, but you've got the the the perp fees.\nGMX allow it so you can choose like individual trading pairs, so like if you wanted to go just put money into the SOL, uh, into the fcoin up, for example, you could, but there is there is obviously, um, if the pools aren't big enough, and if one trader makes a lot of money, you can get kind of screwed.\nSo, like there's obviously high fees for like Fcoin, but if like one guy makes a million dollars, like you can get is sometimes not that amazing.\nUh, so, something to kind of aware of, but this feels like an extension of that basically that you can like own.\nIt's like Uniswap but for perp.\nYeah, this is like the democratization of financial markets to me or like that's their long-term goal and it's like user participation is rewarded because the users are the owners and like it's all on chain.\nI I just think it's like yeah I mean there's no way there was no way to be a liquidity provider before Dexes really and like make money off of the other side of these trades, right?\nYou couldn't go give Binance money and like earn a percentage of fees.\nBut it's that for all of financial markets plus new ideas and owning an entire market yourself if you have enough money to do it.\nWhat What do you think, Ken?\nBecause I know you you follow like public stocks a little bit more.\nIs do you think this bubble around crypto stuff is is nearing to like we see circle just hit [Â __Â ] 40 billion nearly whatever it is.\nLike do you think this starting to get a bit stretched here or do you think people are going to keep coming in?\nI don't know man.\nI mean like the public markets themselves don't seem like they're going down anytime soon.\nFeels like crypto's been maturing and kind of entered that realm where it's kind of hard to see it like Bitcoin and stuff having a meaning like huge down move or anything.\nI mean these treasury companies seem like uh disasters but I don't know what the disaster is yet.\nMaybe he just keeps going for a while.\nLike Long Island Iced Tea and [Â __Â ] turning into a Bitcoin company.\nThat's the kind of vibe.\nDid that happen?\nYeah.\nI mean, it happened back in the day, but like it feels like that's kind of company's doing treasury.\nYou got Tony G spinning up treasuries for HYPE and [Â __Â ] Like who is Tony G?\nI don't know about Tony G.\nLike is he is he like a really well known?\nSome like poker player.\nI don't know if he's a scammer or not.\nLike maybe probably.\nUh but I don't know.\nI don't think it's going to end well, but like it's just like who the hell knows.\nI don't really care either to be honest.\nI think it can end well like the the the treasury stuff.\nYeah.\nI it's it's a bit crazy micro strategy.\nSo maybe the price of Bitcoin like goes down and they all if they all [Â __Â ] up their leverage or like some of them dumber ones who use a lot of leverage forced to sell the crypto that's on their balance sheet.\nLike that's obviously going to happen.\nThe stock goes to zero and like they're forced to sell it, right?\nSo he's a high stakes poker player.\nwas an EU MP at one point.\nThat's pretty random.\nThe actually we're going to be a bit more interactive with this.\nSo in the chat, somebody did ask and we'll get to the circle in a minute, but with Bitcoin hitting 104K emit global uncertainties.\nWhat key indicators is Kuke watching to predict if we are still in a bull run or nearing a correction?\nLove your insights from NFTs.\nDo you look at any like Oh, that's really cool.\nYou look at any technical indicators for this sort of stuff, Cook, or is it a vibe thing?\nNo, not really.\nI mean, yeah.\nLet's see.\nHow do I I mean I'll be long Bitcoin forever.\nI would say like Bitcoin is not really a trade for me.\nAnd then I think the only the only real like I sell calls on on IBIT.\nLike I might do that if I think like okay we're not going to like gig a moon or whatever and like okay hold Bitcoin in different ways, right?\nAnd I try to make some income off of it.\nThat's the closest thing I would get to selling or shorting Bitcoin.\nBut uh yeah, how do I look at this stuff?\nSo, like I said, I have like a bias to being like a long-term bull, and that would apply to like US equity, large caps, and Bitcoin.\nAnd it's because I think that these greedy [Â __Â ] boomers that destroyed the world at Bretton Woods will always just print money, and that'll never end.\nAnd so, as like these high quality like assets get debased, they will go up in like the worthless fiat terms that we measure them in.\nSo, but I I think if I go down from like Bitcoin and the S&amp;P, so I always DCA the S&amp;P and I always DCA Bitcoin, then I have to make other trades.\nAnd so, you know, I'd say my last big trade like or not my last big trade, but like I'll talk about two things like first is Solana.\nAnd so, when I'm making these kind of trades and I'm doing this in retrospect where now I understand how I how I did it and what I was looking at even I did before, but like now I can explain it better.\nI talked about this a bit, but like the coolness rotation, that's the biggest indicator to this NFT kitty guy.\nLike qualitative indicators in crypto are more important to me than quantitative indicators because my major quantitative indicator is eventually they're going to print money and this shit's going to go up.\nBut that works for Bitcoin, right?\nSo yeah, we'll talk about SOL, what I look at in SOL in like fall 2023.\nLike I I I messed around on SOL in 2021 uh in the NFT days and whatever.\nAnd then when SOL was going down to eight in FTX, I sold most of it like 40s50s or somewhere like that.\nIt went down to eight.\nI didn't buy the bottom.\nI thought maybe it was going to be gone.\nI don't know.\nI didn't care that much.\nUm and when it was on its way back up is when I realized like SOL was actually the cool asset.\nLike all the guys were still yet handsome and the video with Jakey and they're chanting in a parking lot and all this stuff.\nAnd so I'm thinking about it more.\nSo that's the beginning of the qualitative indicator that mattered.\nBut then it became in the fall meme coins started to come out on SOL and it obviously made way more sense for memecoins to trade on SOL than ETH even though the ETH maxis wouldn't admit it.\nBut it just all in all like the cool stuff was happening on SOL.\nAnd so if you look at SOL and I bridge it into HYPE like okay now my big trade is always Bitcoin and and like blue chip stocks and that's by DCA forever but like do you think the SOL do you think the SOL KOS are still cool you think that's that's\nwhat I mean I would I would hate to ever be called a something K, you know what I mean like they will they'll call me people will have seen me from the from the first time here.\nOh, he's a SOL K.\nHe's a this K.\nLike, I see that.\nLike, they'll call me that, but I really, if you're paying attention, I'm a nothing K, bro.\nLike, and I think that the guys that are it's the KOS, it's the users, it's the communities, it's the builders.\nIt's like it it's it's always a slow exodus and then you're left in the end.\nSOL will look like ETH, right?\nUnless they can recapture the hot thing.\nIf Pump does their own chains, it's it for SOL, right?\nAnd so for the for the kitty guy, like if I was, you know, I my goal in fall 2023 was I started to see the memes come out.\nI faded with then I saw whiff do what it did.\nAnd then I'm like, okay, this is now probably going to be the theme of the cycle.\nAnd then my goal was to get as much SOL as I could and just stake it and wait.\nAnd then yeah, 2024 or 2025, you know, maybe I'm thinking it's a bit frothy and I start to sell most of it and I kept three quarters of it.\nBut it's all based on qualitative indicators.\nLike the backdrop is the money printing and the backdrop is the Bitcoin price but the decision on SOL it's qualitative.\nAnd now I'm seeing the same stuff.\nSo when HYPE like you know when I started to look at it closely and the sexes were attacking it I'm like okay what's going on here?\nAnd then I start looking at the communities and stuff like and who's building and it's like Jeff had this ethos of fair launch and like they don't talk they just release stuff.\nAnd then you see Hyperunit. is like massively important infrastructure.\nAnd then I look at the communities that are there like the hyposios and it's like okay it's a romeilio derivative but actually like the people are cool like the the memes are good like the [Â __Â ] is based like and it's yeah it's the coolness rotation trade is the most important qualitative indicator.\nEverything else is based on money printing.\nYou only really know that you've been in crypto for a while.\nBut if you think about Q1, which is like all the Solana KOS got caught up in the in the culmination of the memecoin cycle, right?\nLike yeah, if they get done with Trump, they then got done with with the dregs around um what Libra and and some of the other ones around there.\nOh man, the Congo or whatever, Central African Republic came in and rugged us like right.\nThe Kwells were the really ones who became uncool at that time and then and HYPE HYPE at that time was probably trading at what like\n15 four bucks or something.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nLike it it came out and it was four bucks and it went up to 30 really fast and then it kind of ground down.\nSo it feels like Solana K's talking about now.\nWell, Solana the trenches.\nYou're you're still seeing some keep clicking.\nWe know what they're tweeting about.\nWe know what they're tweeting about right now.\nThat wasn't me up.\nI teed it up.\nYou teed it up.\nUh we should get to this because this is the other hot take of the week.\nUh myself and KBM slaving for months on uh on the on a crypto casino.\nUh turns out the Rollit Boys have have rolled it back and have launched an onchain casino with with all of those guys.\nWhat I know you're now associated with them, Coupe.\nUm, we're all we're all friends here, but what what uh think of it?\nLike I know you've obviously you tried out our product too, but I think there's a world for both, but I'd love to hear your take on all of this stuff and also like the approach of marketing as well.\nYeah, it's funny because I didn't ask him too many questions.\nUm,\nso I used it.\nI've used it and I and I streamed on it.\nUm, but it's I mean it's right now it's pretty basic.\nI think it's because of the difference in approach.\nSo, the reason I even like answered them and talked to them is because I do like the non-custodial like onchain,\nyou know, thing.\nLike, I think that that's cool.\nIt's like I'm not going to say the Hyperliquid of casinos because it's not that.\nThat's crazy.\nIf I can't provide if I can't be the house and then steal the guy's money with better odds, then it's not the Hyperliquid of casinos.\nUm, but still, it's like a step, right?\nI do like that.\nNow, I do think like it doesn't really matter.\nThe end user is going to use the best thing.\nsome of their games like I I've got a problem with the fact that they don't have the right Gates of Olympus game and that's like the thing I played the most on YEET is like it's like different they have it's called Gates of Zeus and like he doesn't raise his arm and like I just don't get as excited.\nUm, I think people will ultimately just go use the best product.\nAnd obviously they're spending so much money on marketing right now.\nIt's [Â __Â ] right?\nLike Kobe's saying, you got offered half a mill.\nLike come on.\nThat makes sense.\nIt's that was for uh Is there like a fight within the internal KOS about that now?\nLike it's like why wasn't I given 500k a month?\nLike I told you\nbanks or gains?\nNo, I I don't care.\nI think it's funny.\nI just responded to Kobe and I'm like I feel like the janitor.\nany tips on like getting my my pay up?\nBut uh no, I mean I don't I I haven't actually even talked to a single other K about it and nobody even asked me about it until today like when it when it blew up on the timeline because of Kobe.\nBut uh no, I think it's you know it's just they're like, &quot;Oh yeah, wear the badge\n\n\n\"We're going to pay this.\" And then I'm like, \"Whatever.\" I get a lot of those messages. But I figured it was cool because of the onchain decentralized thing. But uh, the thing, like, I think that's a genuine thing, like, you don't do KYC for something like this, and the re the re and and those two things are linked, which you mentioned. So, like, um, the reason why they could never have Gates of Olympus is because all the all the providers require some level of KYC or license for this to happen. So, like, if you're going to say, \"We're going to do completely decentralized, no license, no KYC,\" you will never get those games. But you can recreate the games, which is kind of what they've done. And and and then so you you have this like no KYC element, but then you can't have the and similarly for sports, for example, like no sports provider would allow that, so then you have to create like a decentralized sports book. What what do you think about it, KeyboardMonkey3? I know you're going back and forth on it a little bit, but yeah. No, I don't want to like say too much, but um, I mean, they they have low RTPs for decentralized product, one would think. Then they clapped back and said, \"Ours aren't approval RTPs,\" but they are. And uh, there's a couple other things I have up my sleeve, but I don't I don't need to share those. But uh, yeah, I don't know. I think it's fine. I think it's a good product. It looks cool, but uh, obviously I'm pretty biased. Um, can it can it only work on Solana though? Like, are the actual trades happening on like this couldn't happen on Bitcoin or on Ethereum, or could it? I don't actually know. Is it like it's more like SOL casino then in that sense, where it's like a Solana because it's all the SOL KS, right? That's what I was thinking. Yeah, it seems like it's a mostly a Solana thing, at least for right now. You can only use Solana on it. Yeah, like you deposit SOL and then you like withdraw SOL. Like it's not multicurrency. That's the thing, like, from a feature perspective and like from purely the user experience, like, I mean, I guess you'd use it if you wanted to avoid KYC, but it it currently, like, I think they have a long road ahead of themselves to build the best casino. Like, if you were just you're a user and you don't care and you don't mind KYCing, you're you're offered more elsewhere, you know? Like, that's just ideas on their marketing spend. That's uh, what do you think about that in general? Like, just it feels like we just spoke about that, like, the the KOLs are are KOLs, like, at the least cool point of the cycle right now. I mean, it might be somebody who has no [Â __Â ] idea about social capital for the target markets they're going for. Not necessarily you, other people. It's kind of weird. KOLs were cool, right? And and now it feels like they're less cool. I think it's hard. You gotta like, I mean, [Â __Â ] I'll just talk [Â __Â ] about every KOL. I don't give a [Â __Â ], right? I'm my own. Like, I'm in my own league, I think. But not like I'm trying to be. It just is what it is, man. Like, I just talk about what I want to talk about. I've always done it the same way. I'm not I don't have a business plan. I didn't I created this account because I got banned from Reddit and then they IP banned me. I banned 10 accounts. I Yeah, dude. Like, I used to be on Wall Street Bets and I was like, \"I just need an outlet to talk about stuff.\" Like, I've always been a massive internet troll. Like, trolling on the internet as a secret hobby for no reason on weird message boards, like, since I was a teenager. And then I went into finance and I used to like trade stocks and do this and that, and like, so I ended up on Wall Street Bets and like I ended up getting banned and that was my biggest troll outlet. And I was also getting way more into crypto at the time, and so I just created like a CT account and or I had a Twitter account because I used to use it to just follow equity stuff, but I never posted or anything, and so I just it was NFTs kind of drew me in and I was posting more and stuff, but point is, there's no business plan there. I've always just talked about what I want to talk about. And so the thing about KOLs not being cool anymore, I guess like most of the people that have like, like most of these people have decided, like, \"I'm going to be a crypto KOL,\" and then they figure out how they're going to do that and they go build up an account. Yeah. They don't they're following, right? Like your point. And so I'm just like, okay, like I think what whatever's going on, I'm usually moving around. I I'm sure I'm going to have a big L and embarrass myself, but I haven't really had a big L in a couple years. I've been in the right places and it's all out of interest. Like, people want to read my takes on stuff and like, cool. And so with that, they get the racism, too. Funniest thing is, I mostly just talk about being racist without being racist. It's a bit of a scop. And then you have it's bro, this shit's an IQ test. Ask someone, \"What do you think about Cook on CT?\" And like the middle curve will be like, \"He's a racist and he's a scammer.\" And you'll be like, \"Oh, well, what do you do that's racist?\" And they'll be like, \"Ah, he's a racist.\" It's like the Trump thing. \"Oh, he's a scammer. What did he scam?\" \"He's a scammer,\" you know? And the smart guys and the dumb guys [Â __Â ] love me. And so, yeah, I think Nick just automatically assumes everyone just assumes that that is that is the racist PFP. But even on this Israel stuff, it feels like the the Nick community feels split even on that. Like I've noticed, oh yeah, it's it's strangely um, mixed. Let's put it that way. But yeah, go going on from that, I think it's a good way to say is that people have now influencers and then they are right, I'll do that in crypto rather than like I got into crypto just by saying and like and just like enjoying the ethos of it and then I became big because of my views. It's very much changed now. Yeah. There's way more manufactured accounts that set out to be an influencer for XYZ reason. Well, no, the reason is to make money, I guess. But then you got different guy, like it's not just me, right? Like, and there's guys that are way better at me than me at just being like like Anom, right? Like Anom is a sick account. He gives out so much information. Like I'm I'm a pretty big fan and he's got sick vibes. Like seems like a nice guy. I never met him IRL, but like he wrote a he replied to some tweet where some guy was like, \"I don't get why Hyperliquid is so valuable.\" Um, and he like wrote this crazy thesis just in a reply, like two days ago. Like there's guys like that where it's like you really have you guys are both those guys, too. You know what I mean? Like, and so that's why KOLs seem boring because the KOL market got saturated with like just man, you didn't grow because people were were seeking out your opinion on stuff and trying to listen to what you have to say and whatever. You grew because you GM 10,000 times and you hacked the Kaido algorithm and [Â __Â ] like Yeah. Kito, what do you think on that? Like that's been a big change this cycle, like, because what you're saying is true and then there was a shift, I think, about a couple of months ago to like, right, we need people who write good content and Kaido is going to create that and I think at the top end of that list, you would agree that like the top of the KTO leaderboard is some it's some of the better accounts, but it's also it's now created this like this pool of of accounts, too, like we used good for certain things, but it's also Like you you kind of see where this is going. Yes, exactly. You see where it's going cuz it's like it was a genius idea at first, right? Because it's it's almost like botting with extra steps, but like the bots are humans. And so, but when they attracted the people with big accounts and existing respected opinions, right? Like, you know, I clicked the button, I signed up, I'm on Kaido, you guys are probably on Kaido. Like, most people tried it and are on it. And so, it's nice. It's like you don't have to do anything. I I logged into it once, but I guess at the beginning where it was like, okay, they're incentivizing people to talk about their clients in like a a frictionless way that's kind of hidden and you get more points on Kaido if it's organic. That's good. But then all these guys, like I said, like the same group of people that decided, like, \"I'm going to grow a crypto account, be a crypto KOL,\" now they've hacked the Kaido algorithm. And so it's a little bit more like overt that it's like pretty heavy-handed. Like people are either Kaido farmers and they're talking about the Kaido projects or they're just like some organic KOL that might mention stuff or might not, right? Like I'm not farming Kaido. And so the value, like the I think the top fee, like you can pay Kaido 150 bucks a month. Like that's what Arbitrum pays them, I think. And what you used to get is like a lot different from what you get now. And what you will get in six months is going to be a lot different. I think the model is kind of like going to go away. Maybe now there's 20 Kaido derivatives, like, so I don't know that you're necessarily getting the value cuz now you're the Kaido farming is done by all these small and midsize accounts, which a lot of them put out great information, like, man, I got to shout out the goat Bandit XD, band Bandit XBT, he became like the king of Kaido out of nowhere, hacking the algorithm, he's a great [Â __Â ] poster, like, yeah, it's like some of these guys, like, did it right and made it work really well, but I think the the entire premise of Kaido is is being cheapened over time. Like it that's just the progression of it. So I don't know if they'll be able to get people to pay them 150k a month for a campaign in six months. We we paid them, we paid them. We didn't pay them 150k a month, but we paid them. I think it I think even they would admit though that like they need the next stage of this is it's weird because what you're saying is true. It's not bots, but it's people writing AI content. It's human as bot. Yeah, it's human bots. It's like this weird world of like like chat GBT, like the [Â __Â ] our information, then they just post mixed in mixed in with good people, right? And it's like, well, and the people reading it, it's like, if you're you're now you know on the timeline, like, \"Oh, this guy's talking about his 50th Kaido project in the last weeks, okay,\" and it's cool, like, if I'm interested, I'll read it, but it's not the same, like, it's not going to have the same impact, feel like [Â __Â ] fake engagement at this. Almost a little bit. Yeah. So hopefully we get Unreal. Unreal. We got some real We got some real Kaido uh slash user. Yeah, we need to uh do this giveaway though, by the way. It's about time. We're about to juice up the kao relatively soon. So, um, yeah, are we doing a giveaway? It's on Let's do the giveaway. We didn't actually pick winners last week. So uh, what are we playing? So we we have to pick three winners, right? So, by the way, if you are watching or listening to us on a space, I know you probably came in on on the Twitter spaces. All the show now is on kick. You can go check us out. Um, we're DJs live on kick. Uh, and uh, obviously you can also listen to us on Twitter spaces, but you're going to be able to watch us on on on kick from now on. Uh, we want to try and grow that as an audience. So, go follow us. Uh, if you're a follower, you are going to be able and the only way to win prizes is also to link your kick account. So, make sure you're following us and that will be how you win prizes going forward. Also, you've got to sign up under the Rekt Radio um affiliate code for YEET. We're probably going to do some form of like a weekly race as well going forward. So, like the top people, you can go see our thing on Yeet leaderboards and we're going to give out the people who are on the top of that leaderboard each week. Also, if you're listening, I just want to give my perspective. This is a massively bullish giveaway, the most bullish kind because when there's a couple things to do, couple hoops to jump through, most people won't do it. So, your competition is low. You have a higher chance of winning. Do the stuff. Five grand a week. That's a lot of money. 250 grand we're going to be giving out uh a year if this show continues. I think I think you I mean, only 200 people are following us on kick right now. So, it's a pretty pretty good odds. Anyway, um, so are we picking them intern? you or or Sims actually is is taking over for for this. So the code web is wrecked. We are picking three winners out of 59 people. Damn. 1500. Good odds. [Music] 59 eligible entries. So 59 people. [Music] Nova. Oh, Nova. They coming up on stage, Sims, or we just we're just speaking to them in the chat? I think we can probably just speak to them in the chat or or do you want to have them up on stage as well? Is Nova in the chat? Uh, they should have been watching to enter the code and get in the code. So, they probably inside chat. If you have a look, I can put the comments back on screen. You can see their name. They're browning over. Yeah, I think we'll just spin for them or we'll do How many uh How many spins do you want? Two more. So, we'll do two. Two more. Okay.

here?\nWell, I think we're just going to run for them.\nI think we're just going to run for them.\nI think it's easier.\nOkay.\nAt least this time because they're actually in the kick chat.\nSo, I think this time we're just going to have them because we we didn't have them pre like we didn't have them chosen from last week.\nSo, we're just going to try it that we run for each person and then we'll give out the prize at the end.\nOkay.\nOr do we just do we just have these guys for the winners next week?\nIf we're not if we're not organized around it, we could just have these guys for\nNo, I'm getting now.\nWe're good to go.\nI'm about to fire it.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, $1,000 lambots lamb chop spins.\nYou You had um 56 entries.\nUh, so Jesus Christ, we got to get this affiliate link going
