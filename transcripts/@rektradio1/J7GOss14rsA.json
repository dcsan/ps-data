  "cleanText": "Heat up here.\nAll right, we're back, and the first week actually with all I know, KeyboardMonkey3's come here. So, OSF is back. We've got Coup back as well. Um, I think KeyboardMonkey3 had a big night last night. Um, so he's, he may come in halfway through, blurry eyed and his usual friendly self, or he may not. We'll see. We'll see how it goes. But we'll see how this dynamic works. Um, have you guys done a show since you, you kind of came?\nWell, we have. I did one when you were a guest, Coug, but not when you were a host.\nYeah.\nYeah. Yeah. There, I came on twice before.\nYeah, and you were there, but then you've been like busy. I'm sure we'll talk about $REKT a bit, but like, yeah, it's nice to be here with you, bro.\nYeah.\nAnd you're crushing it, by the way. I, I see, I see probably not all, but a lot. And it's cool.\nI appreciate it. Appreciate it.\nThe, um, the show works really well. Basically, me and Cook chat, and you, you can talk even less as OSF, so like, you can really be a backseat driver of the whole thing. It would be great when KeyboardMonkey3's here because there's like a lot of, you know,\nyou could just get out the guitar and start strumming in the background.\nYeah. Yeah, I might do. I should. What I should do is, I should go um, anonymous. So, I don't even have a, so, I just have a PFP like Cook, and then you won't even.\nYeah, like, then you don't even know. You don't even know what I'm doing.\nYeah. I, I don't even like being anonymous, but I started it a year ago, and I'm not going to roll it back. But I'd rather be on camera. It's more fun. But yeah, here we are. I almost put that other picture as my PFB for the show. You know that one I sent in the chat today.\nYou should. You should.\nEvery time I, every time I look at that picture, I laugh, bro. You, you laughed at it. You know it.\nYeah. Offend as many people as possible at the same time. Feels like that's where X is going at, at this stage. I just love that Grock, having been basically just trained on X race baiting for the last two years, has now just gone, it's gone fully over the cliff, and now like the, the CEO is leaving. Nikita Bear looks like about to flame out like, um, Mecca Hitler. He called himself Mecca Hitler, man. Like, do you think the CEO leaving has, has to do with that? Like, it can't, it's a big coincidence.\nI think, I think so. I, I reckon, I reckon she's just like, because imagine her job. Her job is to sell ads for X, right? And her job from the start has been like, \"No, you know, we, we're a good platform. We're not racist. We don't do anything wrong.\" And then the literally the trillion dollar bot that that Elon's been building is basically now just spouting out Mecca Hitler. Um, he's probably just like, \"This is, I can't deal with this. Like, how can I sell ads on this platform anymore?\" So, I, I kind of feel like that's, that, that's kind of what happened there. Anyway, um, firstly, a small change to the rewards. We've actually, um, we're going to a weekly race star leaderboard. So, if you, at the end of each show, each week, the leaderboard reset, we're going to choose the winner for the prizes at the end, uh, based on, um, volume from each week. Um, we may mix it up each week and and do different things, but the core rewards will be given out to people, um, who are on, on under the, um, leaderboard each week, just to let you know. So, if you have not placed a bet on YEET this week, I don't know if you'll be eligible. I don't think you will be because we're shifting it to it this week. You just do a $1 bet, um, to be, to be somewhat eligible. Sims has been in the background working out for us, but we'll do the spins at the end. Ideally, KeyboardMonkey3 will be coming through by then. But, um, all right, get into the topics because this is how the show kind of goes now and stuff. We just kind of, we just kind of chat. We just kind of chat about the main stuff of the week. I think the main,\nI can see comments and [ __ ] from people, like, is it in, in Kick?\nYeah. So, if you gone to Kick, if you, I see the comments here. Yeah. Yeah.\nUm,\na real show now, man. Real show. DJ's live is nearly got 500, um, nearly on 500 followers now. So, all porn star. Porn star on Kick. Same. I'm their, I'm their favorite.\nHi porn star.\nOh god.\nJust joking.\nYou can go. Yeah, you can. If you get, create a Kick account, you can go and chat to them. Hey guys, love OSF. Right. Um, um, I'm chatting to them now. But yeah, go check us out. We're now, we're now fully on Kick. Um, we have a bunch of viewers there every single day, and that's, that's who we're going to give prizes to at the end as well. Anyway, I think the main thing today, probably Pumpfun. Feels like that's the thing that everyone's kind of going to be talking about for the next 48 hours.\nUm,\nhas to be at least fresh or out there. You guys in or out?\nI'm in. I'm 100%.\nI'm massively in, man. I've been, man, if you go look at my TWITTER for the last couple weeks, I've been talking about it a lot, and you know, I kind of like, my account probably 5xed in size during the meme super cycle, and so a lot of these people are like Solana maxis, and I'm trying my best to like, beat that out of people's heads, man. But like, yeah, as I've been talking about the Pumpfun thing and how bullish I am and why and whatever, and I cranked it up the last few days, you should see the comments, it's crazy. CT hates this, think they're going to be wrong. Everyone's going to cope. I'm massively bullish. I said a while ago, maybe on here, two weeks ago even, I don't know, but I was like, \"Yo, they're going to go after streaming. They'll go after the web two giants in this kind of social, social media, streaming sphere. That's the play for these guys.\" Um, and he announced it. I think they'll do a chain, too, and everything. But like, yeah, I'm pretty bullish. The token sale is weird. I'd rather just buy it on a DEX and not have to KYC and not have to be like locked out of it. But we'll make it work.\nAnyways,\nI think in Europe it's going to be tough. In the UK it's going to be tough. In the US as well, yeah, it's going to be tough to buy it. So, I don't really know who's going to be able to buy it, but a bunch of people will. I, I just think that it's obviously it's come at like the worst possible time for them, right? Like, in the space of the last week, suddenly, uh, they've been overtaken by this Let's Bonk style of memes. We can go into that a little bit later. So, it's, it's not happening at the best time, but I just,\nWell, as a token investor, that's good, right? I hope Bonk can run up their market share. Like, I think this is a bit of a meaningless metric, and they're pumping the coins themselves, and that's fine. Like, I'm, I'm glad that Solana has a hometown team that's saying they're going to extract less and everything else. Cool. If that thing gets to 90% market share for Let's Bonk on the TGE weekend, I'll be happy because then I'm going to get a better price when I'm buying a token. Long term, they can't compete. Like,\nyeah, I, I actually agree. I, I think it's, it's one of these things where you extrapolate a week's worth of data and be like, \"Oh my god, Pumpfun's over.\" I don't think Pumpfun's over at all. And I think, um, I think it's a bad time for memes, but this is like a bearish cross. You know what I mean? It's like the only reason why this is crossed is because no one's been making any money at memes. But that, that, that will probably come back. But even just the play, I just feel like what they're going after is a bit more expansive, right? If you want to get on back of like what you just said, they're going to go after streamers, and it's not just going to be memes and stuff like that, then I think they've got a shot. Um, well, this is like a really simplistic sort of qualitative way that I've, I try to look at things that I invest in, like, for a long time. I don't know if I talked about this before, but just like buy management, like zoom out, buy management. If you bought good management over the last like 20 years, you would have done really well. Like, you could buy Elon, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos. And actually, I will roll this into a bit of a $REKT shill because I'm coping. But like, I saw on TWITTER, OSF's getting way more serious about, not more serious, but he, he talked about it, and he's like, \"This is going to be my sole focus.\" Like, he didn't say like, \"I'm the big dog. I don't lose. I'm going to win.\" But it was that, like, written different ways, and I was like, \"Huh.\" And like, I was like, you know, I had a lot of respect for him and stuff. That's another buy management case. Like, you could have, when it was down, and I looked at the chart today because I'm like, I should buy this [ __ ]. Yeah.\nAnd, uh, it's like 11x from the bottom, right? But I, I think you can, you can buy Allen. Like, he's obviously an elite Jew. Like, they just got the Epstein list deleted. Like,\nI don't know. I just think, I think you can buy the guy. He doesn't like me. I've never talked to him, by the way. Like, I'm not, they're not paying me. But I, I just think it's a, it's a buy management. You just look at what they've done. I don't think that Bonk is chasing, right? Like, they're just doing what Pump did six months ago. So, I like it for a lot of reasons.\nI think, uh, that's an interesting way of thinking about stuff because I want, I'm trying to think about that a little bit in crypto terms because we do also like to tear down some of the smartest people, like, you would with that logic, you would have bought SBF, probably, you would have bought, um, I'm trying to think who else, I mean, not to say we kind of had that debate last week, remember, he growth investor.\nYeah.\nYeah. Who else would you have invested in that, that would have [ __ ] you over though with incredible, Hyperlid, the opposite, like, that would have been, and that's, that's part of my Hyperlid bullcase is just his ethos, like, no talking, only delivery, 97% of revenue buys their own token back. Like, yeah, maybe it's the buy management era, but CZ would have been a good buy.\nOh yeah, might have got you a couple times, actually.\nYeah, he, he would have got ox, I think would have got you a couple of times. Um, I think it's a bit more mixed in crypto, but I agree with you that, um, I agree with you that's broadly in like VC investing, than then you need to buy like the right, the people with the right ethics, I think, or the right ability to just pull stuff out the, I guess. Were you a believer in the Pac-Man, um, like love?\nNo. Like, I didn't invest in it. I talked about it as a, as this same way. I think at some point I was like, it, it might be like a buy management situation because I figured this was before they announced native yield on Blast, and I was like, he's up to something, like, he's got all this [ __ ] TVL on just a website where you spin a wheel and what, like, or no, it was before that. I, I figured he was going to do something to attack Leo, like, you know, like the liquid staking. And so I like the native yield, but I never put money into it because I didn't understand where he was trying to go with it. Like, when the product is farming, right? They didn't have an app that people were going to use. There was no, like, reason for this stuff to exist, and NFT trading was going to zero. So, I could have seen, and I think I heard Machi on his face once, and he was like, super bullish on Pac-Man, and I was like, I don't know, like. Yeah, but it, it might have looked like a buy management early, but I think it was pretty clear, like, even before Blast launched, that there was nothing there.\nYeah,\nL2 is a tough product to get right. Right. Like, it's just, it,\nI think that the L2 model itself is just broken and weird. Right. Like, we're in a, we're in a world now where you might as well just build the app, like, chain agnostic. Build a thing that makes money, and then you go from there. Like, Hyperlid built the killer app. They got all the users. They got the best experience. By virtue of that, they made the most money, and they build the EVM, and like, they're stitching it all together or whatever. There's a lot more to it than that. But,\ndo you think Luca made a misstep then? That's something I was just thinking about, talking about this. Maybe that's a bit controversial because maybe we all slightly know him, but like, do you think he could, he should have gone down the LT route? Do you reckon you should have just stuck with Pangu?\nI think that eventually the L2 stuff gets for the mo, like, like I said, right? We live in like an app world, and so maybe a lot of this stuff gets abstracted away. Like, I think an end user should never know what an L2 is. So, I think maybe he could have just built some mega app on Solana or somewhere else. But I think, like, I'm starting to look at chains as like ISPs, right? Like, they just like internet service providers. They just give you access to the thing you need to access. I think Luca's fine. Like, I'm a little bit biased because I like Pudgy and I like Luca, but if you look at what they've done, right, and they're kind of going a similar path to Pumpfun, where if Pump's going to attack streaming and social media, it's, that's kind of Luca's direction too, right? And like,\nI don't think, I guess I'm not sure.\nWell, I think Pump's going to do their own chain because if you're like a\n\n\nCommunity-focused project, and you own the consumer relationship. Like, why wouldn't you want the entire economic benefit of your consumers instead of giving a big slice of it up to Soul, let's say? So, it made sense to me when Luca did a chain, why he did a chain. I think what they're missing is the killer app, and like, maybe the streaming business becomes that. Like, I'm not really sure. Do they need like an on-chain revenue-generating monster? And like, is that streaming, or is it like all the tertiary business stuff, because most of the stuff they're doing is happening off-chain, like where they're getting success?\n\nYeah, because they've kind of gone the other way, right? Like, if you think, if you compare Pump Fun and Abstract, Pump Fun have kind of gone down the app into streaming, and maybe they'll do a chain later, whereas Abstract started with this with the chain and then have tried to go into like streaming afterwards.\n\nUm, it's going to be interesting to see how that works out. What do you think about the idea that the only people being rewarded here are the streamers? Like, everyone got [ __ ] wrecked on Pump Fun coins, and yet the streamers are walking away with 120 million for like 100 people on their stream. Do you think that's weird incentives? That's the only thing I was like, that might... I guess it should, like, I mean, if they're taking that path, right? And it's the same thing I think about Luca. Like, I was talking to someone on the team, and I'm like, \"You guys should just throw like crazy money at these web two streamers, like get Kai Senat and all these other people the Zoomers watch.\" Like, I think you'll see streamer contracts look like athlete contracts, and I think Pomp will sign some of them, and Abstract should. And I'll shout out Rasmir, man. I think he's the... Like, I'm obviously... See, I'm not watching any of this [ __ ]. I never watched video games on YouTube. Like, I play the games. Like, that's my generation. And so, but but I like to understand the market and the culture. And so, you know, Rasmir is a sick streamer. Like, he's a bass zoomer. I saw a clip of him yesterday. He was driving in a car, and he had those ridiculous glasses on, and he had a guy in the passenger seat with a laptop open with charts on it. He was holding a phone with Telegram. He had an iPad on the [ __ ] dashboard or something. The guy in the back seat, it's all streaming live. He's on the road driving, is like calling out all the other Zoomer Ks. He's like, \"I'm the best. I got four monitors while I'm driving. This is how you really trench.\" Like, I mean, maybe that's the new entertainment, right? They're like the athletes of this arena, and so they should get paid. Um, but yeah, obviously Pump Fun is like 0.01% winners and 99.9% losers, and that's the business.\n\nI don't have a problem with it, but I understand. Should we go on to Pump Fun here, guys? Like, what are we doing? Like, 120 million feels like we could win over some mortgage here.\n\nI kind of think, like, I mean, what they don't have is serious stuff, right? Like, you got smoking cigarettes talking about all the times he got wrecked and lost all his money, and then you got a bunch of Zoomers doing crazy stuff like Rasmir, like this type of stuff. But I mean, this is on Kick, right? Like, Kick is cool. Like, Kick is... you had the... you had Twitch, and like their terms of service are really strict and everything, but they're the biggest, like, thread guys on there. I don't know why. Um, maybe Pump didn't make them a big enough offer yet, but like, I... I'm pretty bullish on Pump, and I think they actually will be able to attack this market they're talking about. It might make sense, man. Put this on Pump. They have to have a token and stuff, and it's like, maybe it doesn't make sense.\n\nGainy denied being paid to do the streams, but then conveniently get 3% token applications. So, like, maybe it was culpable deniability, or like, what was the word for that? Like, uh, he... he was able to actually... plausible deniability, sorry, that he could say that.\n\nDid he get 3% of the token?\n\nNo, but like % being given to streamers. I'm not too sure that's like...\n\nI think some will get allocated to other people, right? Because there's that community allocation within the airdrop bucket. So there might be...\n\nFuture though. I think that's just for the future. I don't think that's... I don't think that's... Um, I actually don't know. I thought that was just like for future airdrops, maybe.\n\nYeah. I don't know. I... I would, if I was them, and they're giving 3% to streamers, that would be like earmarked for future streamers. They already got the CT natives, and the business that they're going to bring is already here. And so, like, maybe you incentivize these guys. Like, I think Rasmir will drive a lot more growth for Pump Fun than Gainy. Like, the best Jew in crypto is Rasmir. It's not Gainy. And so, I... that's just a little joke, right? But if they're going to allocate... if they're going to give tokens to streamers, which I think they should do as a future investor, like, that's in my best interest, but they should be giving it to... I show feed or like... like pay some big dogs, man. Like, that's the... that's the path. That's the next move, isn't it? Like, one of these guys... one of these, whether it's Abstract or Pump Fun or I don't know what else there is out there in the streaming web. One of these crypto streaming platforms are going to get like [ __ ] Aiden Ross or or one of these big guys and be like, \"Cool, wait, we'll pay you double what you're getting at Kick or Twitch, whatever it is.\"\n\nYou called the top, remember?\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nOh my god.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Shout out to Aiden Ross for actually like just basically saying this is [ __ ] when all those guys are trying to pitch it to him.\n\nThat was amazing. I love that clip. Oh, we're just getting started. Like...\n\nYeah, that would be big, wouldn't it? I mean, that those guys are on insane amounts, and because Kick... Pump has the money for it as well, by the way. They have [ __ ] obviously have [ __ ] ton of money. So...\n\nYeah, but Kick is also owned by Stake. So they money too.\n\nDidn't know that. [ __ ]\n\nYeah. Yeah. So... So, uh, Twitch... Twitch isn't known by anyone, right? Does Stake buy Kick, or is it a product they launched?\n\nI think it's a product they launched. I... I forget the history of it, but but but yeah. Um, there's money in streaming, basically. Uh, but yeah, I agree with you. They... they need to get some bigger people on. You can kind of see from the numbers as well, like they're kind of... it's not really big enough, right? They need to get more mainstream people kind of over there for this to work. So maybe they do just go crazy and go like, \"This is the business model. We... we give everyone a bunch of money.\" Either way, I think it's going higher. Like, when you have this much focus on a token, this much focus on a token and on valuation, once enough people have said, \"Yes, we're going to give 600 million to it,\" if it drops, they will buy it. I just think it will go higher. And and because it's only going to be about 40 to 50% unlocked, it's actually a two billion token. So you got to consider there like two billion that like if coin's at 1.2 or whatever, I just kind of think that this would go higher than that. I just... I just like get the feeling it's going to go a lot higher. So, I don't know if it's like a long-term hold, but you definitely want to... It's definitely going to double. It's definitely going to double, I reckon.\n\nI think you can... you think it dips and doubles, or do you think it just doubles off the bat?\n\nI think it doubles off the bat, mate.\n\nYeah. Too many people are telling me, every time I tweet about this, they're telling me in my comments, it's going to go to zero. So, I don't think there's going to be a dip.\n\nOh, Microsoft owns Twitch. Kind of makes sense, isn't it? Bit more corporate. Um, what do you think about it versus hype? Like, you've been a big hype guy.\n\nUh, and that's the... that's the valuation a lot of people are throwing around, right? Because I know hype... hype spends 100% of its revenue buying back hype, right?\n\nThere is... I saw one of... who's the main Dragonfly partner said they... they... they heard it's going to be 25% of the revenue used for buybacks. Right. So...\n\nYeah, I also heard that 25...\n\nMaybe it's a lower amount of buyback, but it's still... it's still there.\n\nBut that also makes it look kind of cheap at four versus 40 billion, right? Or... or what's your view on those two? Because I think a lot of people are going to start being like, \"Oh, hype looks expensive versus Pump.\"\n\nAnd yeah, I don't, bro. So, I... it's a good question. I think the answer is really easy. Like, I think hype is... I guess even though less people in the CT bubble are acknowledging what hype is and what it's going to become than Pump, whereas Pump has gone through like this meme super cycle. Everybody got wrecked, and like people are saying it's done and Bonk's going to replace it and everything else. I look at it as Hype has already kind of proved the direction that Hyperliquid will go. So, Phantom just gave them 15 million more users yesterday. And like, I think that like if you were going to use a stock broker and they were like, \"Okay, we got every exchange, but we don't have the NASDAQ or the NYSE.\" You would say, \"I'm not using... like, that's a non-starter.\" So, if you're... if you're a broker, like a client-facing relationship owner and trad... you... you have to offer the NASDAQ and the MISC. I think the equivalent in the future is that everybody's linked into, uh, sorry, Hyperliquid. All execution happens on Hyperliquid, or else you're not giving your clients best execution. I think Robin Hood perfs will move there eventually. Coinbase, anyone... like, the old model doesn't work. So, I'm... I'm a huge believer, and it... you have enough information out there now combined with the buy management and everything else to know that... or not know... not know, but I'm much more confident, like, they're... they're worth 40 billion. They're worth a lot more with Pump. I'm more... I'm more like, I think that they can be worth 40 billion or whatever it is. Let's say, like, we got to see revenue, but they have to prove that they can grow their user base. And so, I like that their... their like stated goal is, \"We're going to attack web two social media and streaming,\" because that's what I think they should do, but I need to see them attack it and actually like make some dense. Like, I need to see them get users, and I need to see revenue grow up, go up. Um, because yeah, CT doesn't matter, right? Like, CT is very small, and like, everyone on CT is kind of [ __ ] [ __ ]. Like, I see them, bro. I just get all my information from my own comments. And yeah, I... if I see them make a dent in the the market that he's... and I liked how they were aggressive about that in the tweet. They're like, \"This is what we're going to do.\" If they start to do that, I'll put them more on on par with Hyperliquid. So, I would say they're both fairly valued right now. Hyperliquid's probably undervalued. Um, Pump at four billion is is undervalued to me if they can dent the market they want to go after, and I think they can.\n\nSo, I've been... I've been... I've been... So, you go...\n\nI was going to say, the thing that's interesting to me, it... when I was reading through it earlier, is of that 33% that, um, was it 33% that's going, or 30%... whatever it is that's going for public sale, something like 18%, I think it was, has been allocated to institutions, which has already been sold. So, there's already like a ton of big money behind this that's institutional.\n\nOh, I didn't know that. That's a big deal.\n\nYeah. Let me... um...\n\nYeah, this is going to fly. This is going to fly. If there's no doubt that was oversubscribed, too. There's no doubt in my mind that was oversubscribed.\n\nWhich mean... which means that if this dips, they're going to buy it. Like, there's... there's just when you raise that amount of money. Um, and it's not... it's not a bunch of like NFP people buying other deeds, which even then that actually went above mint, right, for for a while, right? Like, whenever we've seen these big raises, I just think it will go higher.\n\nIt won't go like crazy higher, but I think it will go higher.\n\nGoing to try find it again, but it's that to me, that was that when I saw that, yeah, 33% will be sold in the initial coin offering. Um, of that 18% is a private sale for institutional purchases and 15% in a public sale. Um, same terms for both. The private sale has already been fully allocated. So, they've already raised...\n\nYeah, dude. This is going to fly. This is going to fly.\n\nThey've already raised 720. What? Uh, is that right?\n\nYeah. Um, 720 mil. Is that right?\n\nYeah. I mean, it's crazy figures, right?\n\nNo, it's a 600 million raise, right?\n\nIt's a 600 million raise.\n\nYeah. Why am I... 18% of four bill is 720. So, what... why am I... what am I doing wrong there?\n\nOh, actually, or is it not four bill?\n\nUm, maybe.\n\nYeah, I don't know about the maths. I don't know about maths, but but either way, it's going to... I think we need to work out the fine print of what they meant by 18% is 18% of the of the 600, or is it... is the 600 separate?\n\nI reckon buy it. Long and short. Um, I reckon buy it. I don't think it's going to be a 10x, but it's an easy 2x. If you can buy it, I think... I think you should.\n\nThere's no doubt in my mind that this is going to go higher, but um, yeah, I've been having the same view as you, Cook. So, I've been pretty vocally saying, \"Look, I don't think the money's in Solana for a while now.\" Like, um, originally it was Bitcoin, and then I've been talking...\n\n\nAbout ETH a lot more recently, whereas I know you've been more on the hype train. Um, what do you think being short Solana is now a bit consensus? That's something that I've kind of, I'm debating a little, like, what is the consensus trade now? Because I, I thought ETH was non-consensus about a month and a half ago, and now I feel like it's a bit more consensus, but then I also think hype is really consensus, and now I'm starting to think, like, is everyone just like completely failing Solana, and maybe that's a buy, or am I just overthinking it? Like, I still have Solana. Like, I have spot staked, and I, I have probably, I sold 80% of my Solana um, at the beginning of the year, and I was always going to keep some. Maybe it goes to 3, 400, and like, but for me, like, it hinges on them capturing the next hot asset or the next narrative. Like, and so if $PUMP's going to leave, like, I believe, like, I think they'll start their own chain. And even when you have an app that generates like a billion dollars of revenue in a year, and it's all sell pressure on your token, right? Like, it's counterintuitive.\n\nSo I just, like, economically, like, what's, what's going to happen with Soul? What has to happen for it to, like, 2x now? It's crazy. There's way easier trades out there. So I like to hold it. Great asset. Bitcoin's the best asset. The only, like, the only token I can get like massive conviction in to take like a real size position is hype because of, like, you know, the stuff I was talking about earlier. I just think, like, the economics of it and the management are, it's the best option in crypto, and I'm really interested in what they're actually doing. I would never, like, short Solana or anything, but yeah, I think, look, it was $8 before Pumpfun, right? Like, what was it trading at in fall 2023, and it was the meme super cycle that just like pushed Solana to 300, and I don't, I'm not saying that can't happen again. Like, they did great in NFTs. They were the B chain after Ethereum, but like, when the hot asset, whatever DGens use as money, and then that's the money they're using to buy the thing that they want to own as DGens, that is the thing that will go up the most. And so Ethereum did great in NFT era, and DGens haven't had a reason, like DeFi, then NFTs, and then there hasn't been a reason for DGens to own Ethereum or buy it to use it to transact since then, and it's struggled, right? And all this institutional stuff. Oh, the banks are going to use it and all this. Yeah, I know the banks are going to use it. I heard Avac has a great institutional BD team, and no one gives a [ __ ], right? Token $16 or something. And so, yeah, like, what, what will be the, the next, a, what's the next thing? Because I think we're still midcycle. Like, memes have to get squeezed more. Like, there will be a time where people look at meme buyers and, like, the meme loyalists on the timeline, and you'll look at them like how you looked at cartoon buyers, like last year, and you're like, you're crazy, like, you buy NFTs who, like, and there was still these maxis, right? And like, so we need to get to that point where everybody's laughing at the cartoon maxis, and then Soul will have to capture the hot asset again. Like, I just, and, and I'm not saying that can't happen, but it seems like there's a shift more towards, like, I mean, why wouldn't you just buy one soul, and then everything on Soul happens in USDC, and you have a gas token for life, because all totally does is scale it and make it cheaper. It just keeps getting faster and cheaper.\n\nAnd so, like I said, ISPs, right? Like, internet service providers, like, you wouldn't invest in those companies, but they enable all these other great businesses that are on the on the internet, and they give people access to them. And so I think investing in a chain now, like a pure chain, it's hard for me to believe that the chain will capture the hot meta because probably an app will just come out and be the hot meta, like Hyperlquid or Pumpfun. This has been, this has been a pretty big shift, I think, in a lot of, like, the, the smarter people that I follow on X have been basically talking about this, right? Like, not that chains are dead, but that the real gains are going to be in apps that maybe become chains, but just like teeter on the edge. This is like the app cycle, basically. Um, which I think is all the users, all the users who care what a chain is are here probably already, right? And like, everybody who gets scared of the word chain and doesn't want to learn any of this [ __ ], and a bridge will freak them out. Like, they're the people we're trying to attract, I guess. And so you got to do it in like a sneaky way with a clean app that looks like it belongs on a, excuse me, on an iPhone. Um, like, like the tech, in my mind, I say it a lot on TWITTER, but like, I think the tech has now been fully commoditized. Like, all, all how many chains are there that feel exactly like Soul, and like, you can say Soul has the users, but really does Soul have the users, or does Phantom have the users? Like, Soul wouldn't be Soul without Phantom in the first two years. Like, yeah, I think apps and revenue are the, are the new thing.\n\nThe new hot thing is, like, even the Rekt Radio story that we're just talking about, like, that's, I mean, he didn't, you didn't go down the chain route, and you just have this, like, oh, yeah, you have a, you have a flywheel which works. Hyperlid has a flywheel that works. Pumpfun, we're now talking about a flywheel that works. Some of the best performers of the last couple of months have been these DeFi coins with some form of a flywheel suddenly, and it's like, maybe this is that time. Um, it's been, which has not been the trade for a long, long, long time, right? If you really wanted to have good returns in crypto, you stuck to the chains, and you just faded every single one of the apps. Um, like, because they were always shitty governance coins, and it never really worked out. And then now it suddenly feels like that's, that's been the main shift. And there's, I think that's a, like you said, I think it's a medium-term shift. I think, like, for the next three or four years, if you're going to make money in crypto, don't focus on the chains because they're probably not going to be the best, um, the best place to make the, make, make money. I think, I think focusing, focusing on apps is, is maybe where, and maybe the life cycle is a little bit shorter, but I think that's where you're going to see the majority of the gains.\n\nI, I, I agree. So I think it's interesting, actually, because a year ago I was saying the complete opposite, and and for three years, like, I, I have not owned a token that is not the base economic token of a chain for a while. Like, I guess hype is that, but like, really everyone transacts in the app on USDC, like, and the buy pressure on a token makes it a lot different. But I'm like, I would never own an ecosystem token. I would never own a utility token. Like, everybody was talking about Jupiter forever, like, pre-airdrop, post airrop, oh, it's so good. It's the best Dex. Yeah, it's the best DEX, and the token's garbage. Why own it? Like, you're better off buying the economic token for the chain where the activity happens, stake it so you're not getting killed by inflation, and sell it when, like, activity on the chain peaks. But yeah, you think that that era is kind of over, like, for these huge chains. The explosive growth for Solana is done. That's basically where I'm at, right? And it's not going to come back, and some other alt L1, like that the narrative's gone. Like, it doesn't matter. No one's going to build an alt L1 that's so good that all the good builders go there and all the users go there.\n\nIt's not as good. What, so what do you think? I know we spoke two weeks ago about useless, and it was trading at like 150, and then it went all up to 250, and everyone's like, oh, Bonk guy was right, all these coins have gone up. This to me feels like not the final throw of, but it just feels, I don't feel like this is good for the ecosystem what's going on there. It just feels as though, like, we're just shifting money between certain things rather than anything like valuable being created. What, what do you think about this? You, you're a bit more of a Bonk guy fan, I feel like, or he's made you money in the past following some of his trades.\n\nI've followed some of his trades. I've made money on it. Like, you can, yeah. Can't ever complain about that. But, um, no, it's, it's always different, isn't it? Like, it's always, um, um, I mean, sorry, it's always been this, this way. Like, meme coins for a long time now have not been PvE. Like, even the coins that become big coins get PvPd and that kind of stuff. So, this is sort of just like another derivative of PVP, right? Instead of it being between coins, it's now being between platforms. It's just another thing to show you that there isn't, like, the pace of, like, coin growth is much faster than the pace of adoption. Um, whereas the opposite was true in 2021. So, um, at least for like altcoins anyway, like, maybe that's not the case for Bitcoin. So, I just think, um, it's just the same as what we've seen for the last two years, but it's a different, you know, it's now happening on a platform level rather than on a, um, on like coin level, basically.\n\nYeah. Um, do you think this Bonk guy thing is going to, like, he, he's one of these influencers at the moment where he's kind of seems like a pure influencer, like, oh, he's one of the good guys, generally, when you become main character, you know, it gets discovered that somehow he's work, like, he's working for Bybit or something like that, like, there's, there's something that's going to come out, and then everything can, can just like get destroyed because that's what we like to do in crypto, going in life. Do you think you see something like that coming for him? Coug, I know, I know you.\n\nI mean, everybody, it's not a secret, right? I thought everybody knows what's going on with this stuff. Like, no. What's going on? Tell us. I actually don't know really. Well, the bonet, right? Or something along those lines. Oh, I don't know that much detail. Like, I, I like him, I guess. Like, he's cool. Um, he kind of chirps me. I don't think he likes me. But it's all, look, as like a meme purist, I'm obviously the funniest guy on TWITTER. Like, that was a joke. Nobody laughed. But uh, no, like, I was laughing. I love this [ __ ]. I love the culture. I love memes. Like, I was there was so many different metas and stuff in this meme super cycle. It was a great market. I was great at predicting attention. I loved it. And I just see these Bonk guys coming in at the end. My problem with it is there hasn't been a single original idea off this launchpad. The, the, the Bonk team is launching them all. They got Funk Guy in there. are just plowing their own money in there to get the tokens up. And that's fine. I like it. Like, if you see bonkai buy a token and you're you're trying to guess, right? Are they going to bonk this one? Buy that [ __ ]. I know it's not funny. I know it's cringe. I know they're all gay and all their tweets suck. That's my issue with it. But buy it anyways. I do it. Half these bonk coins come out and they try to pay me to shill and I shill some of them. Like, I know how this stuff's working, right? But it's not. If you think this is like organic buyers and like this coin is funny enough to get on the news and it's like a fartcoin and haha useless coin. Like, come on. This is like, this is Meteora done all over again. This is basically what we're doing in January all over again.\n\nWell, I mean, yeah, they were, they were doing Meteora was doing weird stuff with the LPS and like removing LP pools while the token was pumping and like what, I don't know what they were doing. There's like a video about it, but it's not like I, they're just buying the token, but it's not organic, and that's fine. Like, Chinese memecoin investors will only buy a coin if they know that the team is going to scam pump it, right? And so if you can guess, like, oh, there's Bonk guy with another cringe idea and he's, he's magically in this token again or they sent him a bunch of it. Who did it? Who knows? Like, who launched it? Who knows, right? Like, you can buy this and make money, but I don't know. Like, these aren't, yeah.\n\nI don't even know what that is. Like, bro, it's like some cartoon cat. Yeah, it's a cartoon cat. They said it's Bonk's sister or something. Like, that's what I mean. They just try these, like, they're, it's whack, bro. Like, it's just not funny. Like, yeah. So, but it'll probably get listed on Gate or something. Like, so there's plays there. Useless seems to be the one that they've tried to crown as their, their, like, king coin, right? Because it's like, I guess it's the closest thing to a good coin. It's just, it's, it's a derivative of 20 other coins we already saw. So, none of it's funny to me. And it's, it's all just insider, but I mean, insider plays when you know they're insider are the ones that are going to make you the easiest money.\n\nYeah. Yeah. That's the thing. Like, it feels like you just need to get in there. I feel like that's just a place that is just the way in crypto, right? Like, I remember who, who put, wrote a tweet like that while back. Maybe it was Frank. He was like, \"Look, if you've been around in crypto for this long and you're not an insider on anything, like, you're doing it wrong.\" Like, yeah, he got hooked for that. He's like, \"I am an insider.\" True. Like, even if it's just on a small scale, like you're involved in NFT project and you get, get some information early or you get, like, become a community member of whatever, so you get that is just crypto. And it's not like not you looking for it. Sometimes it just is crypto. Like, you hang around with enough people enough of the time and there's always something coming out.\n\n\nLike, just pay attention and you'll be able to find essentially private information or that, like, \"Oh, those guys going to do that.\" Do you know that him, him, Gajira guy? Yeah. You know him? Yeah, he's cool. Like, I'm not sure he likes me very much either, but I, I really respect this guy. He, he operates like [ __ ] posting half of the men. No, no, no. I don't talk [ __ ] to any of these guys, but it's like, whatever. Like, he's like, he's kind of like me, where even more so, maybe, but he's like totally solo, unless he's lying, but he tweets about it. He just does like his own thing in a vacuum, and but he, he had a tweet or something one time where he was like, it was about this insider information, and he's pretty eloquent, so I'll butcher it, but here's the spirit of it. Like, he's like, \"First of all, all the information is on chain, so like, you can see all this [ __ ] happening, like, as it's happening on chain, number one. And also, there's no like anybody that got a social edge or like, and I don't even fully agree with it, actually, because there's some insider stuff that's sketchy, right? But like, like you said, crypto is kind of like it's relationships, it's networking. If you're around long enough, you meet the right people, you'll have some information.\" That's all NFTs was, right? Like, you got some information, keep it a secret, blah, blah. It was even for them now, cuz now everything happens too fast. But he was basically like, even like Kos's or whoever, like, they've developed a social edge, like, they've, they've worked for this social edge that's part of crypto. You have to understand it. You can do it too. Like, that is crypto, and I kind of believe it too. Yeah. I mean, that's what it is. People that FUD insider stuff would do the same stuff if they got a chance. They're just not in the chat. So, so in that world, like, even if they were to come after like Bonk Guy, he's actually just played the game better and probably fairer than some other people, right? But he's just got himself into a position of like, whatever I buy, people buy. I'm going to be selective about what I buy, but like, yeah, I'm just shooting fish in a barrel. Well, he's not nuking people either. Like, he's Yeah. You know, he's holding the coins and people are like, if you're like, \"Well, this guy's going to hold this thing till I'm looking at useless 279 million.\" Awesome. Like, I saw it for the first time at 500k or something. Like, if you're like, \"Oh, Bonk is not going to nuke it.\" Like, that's not his reputation. It's great that it's insider. Like, yeah, I don't know. I think it's fine. Crypto time in crypto uh, is is greater than time in crypto. I think even the biggest [ __ ], if you're around, as long as you don't like get frustrated and walk away, like if you're there watching all the time, you're going to catch something, bro. 100%. And also, like, you can do pretty bad things and the the community just forgets it within a couple of months, right? It's just like, \"Oh, okay. He's back.\" Particularly if you're an OGF just [ __ ] left. Um, uh, yeah, particularly if you're an OG, like it's just like, \"Oh yeah, it's fine.\" Like, he's been around for a while. Like, um, you get enough. That's kind of sad, I think, for some people. But I, but it's just a reality. I just don't know how to describe it. But um, you only really get it after being here for a while. I think it's, it's I think it's important to to provide value and obviously, like, if you're really going to, if you're really going to strive to like create a business in crypto, I do think it helps to have that level of like trustworthiness. Like, it's really helped us on YEET. I know it's really helped OSF with $REKT. Like, if you're really going to try and make like go for eight, nine figures in crypto with like a business, I think it really does help you to have that. But you, there's a lot of people who can make a lot of money um, just being around for a long time and just being known as a personality, right? Like, it's kind of, it's kind of obvious. Totally. So what, what else are we looking at this week? Like, um, I feel like Pumpfun, Pumpfun's kind of nuked a lot of the the memecoin market. ETH is coming back a little bit. So, ETH memes are moving, but there's only really a few of them. Um, you wrote out this $REKT. Uh, I mean, $REKT is actually, I looked at the top 300 movers or top thousand movers and $REKT is up there alongside all these Bonk guy coins. Do you want to talk about this at all? I don't really know if you said anything new or rather just like repackage what everyone kind of knew from the the wrecked paper, but the shite paper. Yeah, the shite paper. Um, yeah. What do you want to talk about a little bit? Like, it caught attention again. I what I would say is I think there are some people out there, believe it or not, in the world who want to put money into crypto but don't want to just buy memes and don't and I think the big problem with memes and new memes is like they get attention, then they die and then move on to the next thing and people don't have time to just like play the rotation game. Um, and it's been very hard to find some sort of PVE coin or a coin where like, you know, you have a complete fake, you know who the the team is behind it and they're going to actually be genuine and do oh [ __ ] and do and do the right thing. So, I think that's kind of been um, it's been one of the uh, one of the problems. Um, the reason why we put out that paper was because I think it adds a layer of legitimacy to what we're doing. So, a lot of people have just been like, \"Ah, this is just like another memecoin, whatever.\" Don't really understand it or don't really get it. Um, but, you know, it's a whole like 15-page light paper that I wrote out, which the the reason why I wrote it was because we were having a lot of conversations with like liquid funds in terms of getting them into the token. And pretty much all of them were like, \"Oh, do you have a white paper or do you have like any documentation I can read on it?\" And I was like, \"Fuck, not really.\" I had this like random tweet as my pinned post, but that's it. So wrote this thing out and number one, I think it adds a layer of legitimacy to what we're doing. But number two, um, I've been having these conversations with other people for the last two or three weeks and I think the reason why the token is up a lot is because we have been speaking to liquid funds on it and I think they've been buying um, or at least I know they have um, and um, I'm able to actually provide them with some documentation on like, hey, this is how we're thinking about this idea of a brand coin. Yes, like it has no inherent value, but there are some real explanations and legitimate reasons as to why the price would move up or down and this is how you can think about it. And we're getting people to like buy into that idea and buy into that narrative and I think that's, you know, one of the reasons why it's up. So, you know, I would say the the movement since the Binance alpha launch, which was two weekends ago, well, they nuked you. They nuked us. Yeah. I mean, you know, you have to get them some supply. It gets airdropped to their community. That's just you, you got to kiss the ring. Um, so it was always going to happen, but we've, you know, unlike most tokens in Binance Alpha, we bounced back pretty aggressively. I think we're almost 2x higher than that the lows of that day now. Um, but since then, it's it's all like carefully planned. It's like, okay, let's do that. Now it's a good entry point for these guys to get in, hit up all the people I spoke to and say, \"Hey, by the way, we're down based on this.\" Like, this is your entry point. Basically, here's my hot take. Here's my hot take on on it all. I don't think 1% of the people who saw that read it. I, I think really respect. But the fact that you wrote out 2,000 words or whatever it [ __ ] was. Once they see that, they're like, \"Oh, fuck.\" Like, if somebody has actually written out 2,000 words here of a pitch, he's probably serious. It's what Cook was saying earlier. It's like, \"This guy's all in.\" Like, if you, if like who the [ __ ] writes out that amount of words and it's not written by AI, like you can tell you've written it. Um, I reckon that's why people buy it because I don't think the thesis is necessarily that different to like if you've been following it, you, you've been following it. But if you can just, I don't even think if you send it to a VC, they're reading it. But if they see, wow, this is actually like a thousand words or 2,000 words, they'll buy it. So like, I think that's what it is. Yeah. You could be Yeah, it could be that too. I do think um, I think people are not really realizing how all in I am on it. And as we move higher, more and more people are realizing how all in I am on it and stuff like that, I guess, is the is a sign to the market of how all in I am on it. Um, but I have a question for you, OSA. Yeah. Yeah, go for it. about about $REKT. Um, it's two parts. Yeah. Uh, okay. So the and I this popped in my head because I saw Mando's right. I don't read. I specifically don't read, like, I don't even read my own long ranty tweets. That's true. Um, okay. So, it said something like in the tweet, it was like, you bought this, but you got nothing. And so that's kind of I, I remember at the beginning of the $REKT token, I think that you had talked about how token holders will get equity in the $REKT business or something, and then so and then that changed, and then now the focus is brand coin, which I like much better, that that other idea is probably too confusing and so on. So, two-part question. Um, did it change from you, you were maybe going to get equity to you got nothing? And then the second part of the question is like, what is a brand coin? Like, from you, I would like to hear because as I, what are the two brand coins I think of when I think brand coin? $REKT and Pudgy. Yep. So yeah, what do you think? Yeah. So the first question, we actually did give equity, but it was to our NFT holders. So the $REKT was gift was gifted to our NFT holders, $REKT holders. That was done about almost six months before TGE, actually. I think it was six months before TGE. So we actually did do that last year. That's probably what I saw. Yeah. So we, we did do that. So our community, most of our community, at least like the OG $REKTers, they all own some of the equity in the company and they will also airdrop some of the token. Um, in terms of what is a brand coin, every company in the world has some sort of brand value, right? There's some sort of premium you would pay if you're buying a company. There's some sort of premium premium you would pay over Yeah. Goodwill. That's intangible asset, bro. Exactly. Yeah. Over over their net asset value. Now, in corporate finance, what happens is, let's say Coca-Cola buys a random company and the company's worth 500 mil and they pay a billion dollars. On their balance sheet, they now have a line item of 500 mil, which is goodwill. But it's just a balance sheet item. It's not liquid. You can't do anything with it and the value of it is governed by basically two people doing a transaction at one point in time and that's it. So $REKT right now has 150 million, 160 million almost um, FTV. Why would people buy something like that if it has no equity, doesn't own the IP, doesn't benefit from any revenues, you don't get any real benefits from it? Why would anyone buy that? Because they like it. It's a sentimental thing, right? They like the brand. And so I view that as actually a liquid version of this concept or idea of goodwill or a brand value of a company. And every time I speak to trad people who are like, \"Ah, this is [ __ ], it's not worth anything.\" I'm like, \"Well, look, if you think that, there's literally millions of dollars of this thing trading every single day, so go ahead and [ __ ] short it. You know what I mean? Whereas your [ __ ] goodwill on your balance sheet, mate, like you decided what that number was and it's there and you can't do anything with it. No one can revalue it or anything. It's just there. It's illquid. So, I think that's a really important concept where it's like, okay, this is actually a very traditional corporate financial concept, but it's now liquid. People can actually speculate on it and trade it and take the other side of it. If you don't believe in us, you can take the other side. You can literally go out there and short it. So, um, that's kind of like how I view what it is. And it, it doesn't really work for everything. It works. If you have a real product and you know, Penu is definitely a good, a good example of this because like, why would anyone buy Penu? They like the brand. They like what it is. It's a sentimental thing, right? So, um, it only really works if you actually have like a real business and a real brand behind it and that's how people, you know, want to express it. I think the thing that we've done differently is you actually are able to earn some of the coin when you purchase the product. So consume to earn, which is not a new thing. There's been [ __ ] tons of consume to earn things and they've all failed. The only reason why ours works is because we've had a four-year strong community and then we launch the token rather than launching the community with the token where you just get people who want to flip things quickly and and leave, right? And I guess part of it is also, you know, myself, Amanda, having been in the space for a long time and generally being good actors.\n\n\n, I think people, there's a level of trust there as well.\nSo, um, I think it's a very powerful concept, and when I explain it that way to like trad people, they're just like, \"Oh, I don't really have a counterpoint to that, or I actually love it.\"\nI love the goodwill explanation, like, yeah, I mean, easy to understand from that angle with my background, and aside from it, like, I mean, the meme angle of just crypto, like, okay, you don't think it's worth something?\nWell, there's a 24/7, 365 market telling you it is, bro.\"\nSo, exactly.\nI actually love that.\nYeah, that's really cool.\nAnd I think you can pitch that to buy guys actually.\nI think that as a concept for them, right?\nThat's why we have the light paper because I can just send that over to guys, to people who, like, you know, some of these guys who bought the token, right?\nThey don't invest in memecoins, like, their fund mandates are, \"We can't touch meme coins.\nWe don't touch meme coins because they can't justify it to their LPs when it's like, oh, hey, I just lost [ __ ] shitload of money on, you know, whatever it is, random animal coin.\nWhereas this, they can like say, \"Hey, there's actually a real business behind it with real revenues.\nHere's a justification for why this token should have any value.\"\nAnd now we can sort of like, we can enter kind of like enter the meme world, but have a real justification behind it, I think.\nAnd bro, it's like a funny concept, like a liquid Goodwill, right?\nLike you got some business combination that happened 20 years ago, and they're advertising Goodwill over 30 years because they decided that like it's a nonsense number, right?\nLike, exactly.\nsale, it never gets updated.\nYou can't update it unless you go do another transaction.\nLike, that's really cool, man.\nI don't think Goodwill's a scam.\nAnd this like is like, well, come on.\nWe're trading it now.\nSection two, section 2.2 of the light paper.\nLiquid brand equity is in there, boys.\nIt's in there.\nThey are going to update IFRS for you, bro.\nThat's my goal.\nI want to, I want to shout out an IFRS.\nYeah.\nYou want an IASB accounting rule for?\nYeah.\nUm, exactly.\nAll right, guys.\nWe're kind of coming up the, the only thing I was going to talk.\nWhat was it?\nThere was one more topic I wanted to talk about, but I've forgotten what it was.\nSo, maybe we should go to, um, oh, it was actually just the death of gaming coins.\nThere was a ton of gaming coins which just like completely died again this week, but we don't need to, we perhaps don't need to go into that.\nUm, shall we, should we do the spins?\nI think the code is wrecked, by the way.\nI don't know if that went on screen earlier.\nSo, go over to boards.com, put in wrecked.\nWe'll give you another minute or so to kind of, um, to do that because I think it was put on the screen earlier.\nAnd, um, and then we're going to choose three winners.\nUm, Sims.\nOh, are we doing this via?\nWe have Okay.\nI have the Okay, one of you guys needs to log in on your side on like, I don't know if we have the WC radio.\nShould we do it via the FOMO account maybe?\nUh, yes.\nI'll need a minute.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI, I'll, I'll, I'll, uh, I'll give it the, um, I'll bless it now in the back end.\nI'll do it like that.\nI think that's probably the easiest way to do it.\nYeah.\nLet me just, uh, yeah, hang on.\nThis was a good show actually.\nIt worked well.\nWe were, we was, I was scared that without KBM it would just be me and Cook, but OSF actually spoke the most, he's spoken in months.\nI think this show format works way better.\nWe used to just have guests on and it used to be like me and the guest, but now I think it works way better to bring people on, um, to chat about stuff.\nI think we've all got, um, we got enough time views on stuff, right?\nIt's, it's a, we should definitely, I mean, how are we not making 120 million?\nGainy's up there singing songs.\nUh, last time I saw with like some guys in prison.\nThat was the last Gayy stream I saw.\nAnd this, this stream has gone downhill since.\nWell, you know, G streaming from Israel, and I don't know if you know much about the background of the management of Pumpfun, but that's why he's making, he's not even streaming anymore.\nHe said he's not even streaming.\nLike this is his first TGE, bro.\nHe's got now it, he's got two years of getting smoked on leverage trades until he's broke again and has to do another deal.\nWell, Matt's Jewish.\nI'm, I'm married to a Jewish woman.\nWe can, we can make it work, Alan.\nLike, we can, we can make this happen.\nUm, let's make a deal happen.\nI would like, even if Allan Fuds me, I'd like to know what he thinks.\nI've been kind of pumping Pumpfun.\nLike, I'm taking a lot of heat.\nThey're like, \"Oh, you're a paid chill.\nhire you Bonk supporting the Solana ecosystem, bro.\nI don't care.\nI'm just trying to make money, bro.\nLike, I don't like Allen at all.\nI don't like Pumpfun.\nThey're massive extractors.\nI don't care if they are or not.\nI would be, we nearly got the deal.\nWe, we nearly got, we nearly got on the seed round and then I [ __ ] it up.\nUh, famously, famously didn't reply to a DM for a month and we're, we're not in.\nSo me and Allan talk quite a lot actually because, uh, we talk about thing.\nYou should, he, he reads Mando minutes a lot.\nSo he, um, he's, uh, he's like a big, uh, I think he likes it as he should.\nAnd so you should talk to him and pitch like a, like a smarter commentary, more highbrow.\nLike that's why this is cool, right?\nBecause we just talked about crypto and it's pretty sophisticated.\nI'm sure the users like it, and there's nothing like that happening on Pumpfun, bro.\nIt's guys in cages eating their own [ __ ].\nLike, it really is, right?\nI would have thought it would have gotten slightly better, but it's not.\nIt's like there's now like a streamer house with with crypto Jakey.\nIt's, it's, and then, and it's cool, singing, singing with random, random people in prison.\nIt's like, it's, it's a strange, um, strange group.\nWe can, we could definitely, we can elevate you, Alan.\nCome on.\nLet's do a deal.\nOkay.\nUm, real quick then while we go through this, can you bless my Sims account, please, for Sims?\nOkay.\nYeah, I'm not on the other one.\nSo that'd be great.\nUm, what, what we're going to do here, I've made a decision.\nIs it the Sims or Sims?\nNo, just just Sims.\nSIMS.\nOkay.\nUm, the, there's three winners today.\nOkay.\nThe two are going to be selected by the wheel.\nYour number one weekly leaderboard by quite a substantial amount is in chat but can't enter.\nSo we're going to give him a spin as well just because he's put in so much volume this week.\nIt's only fair.\nLet's do it.\nSo that will be Quamari.\nHe can have the first spin for or whatever we do on the first go.\nI think we do lamb shop because it's been fun how we've been doing it recently.\nOkay.\nUm, and each one of us can just can be the one who drives.\nUm, right.\nLet me share the wheel and let's pick two of the winners then on kick.\nOkay.\nSo, number two.\nRich LOL.\nRich LOL.\nOh, I thought in the chat.\nYeah.\nMeet to the moon, boys.\nHe's here.\nHe's here.\nWe'll do another, do another one.\nSo it's I am Rich Lol in kick and our number three will be X Poppy.\nX Poppy.\nAmazing.\nI love this song.\nYeah, that's the, uh, the turtle, an actual, we got [ __ ] DMC for it.\nwho's non-copyright.\nOkay, so we got three winners.\nWe got the top of the leaderboard, Kari.\nWe got, uh, Rich Law, second go and X Poppy, third go.\nSo, let me just remove that.\nMark down the winners.\nUh, and then we will do some lamb chop.\nAre you guys playing for them all individually?\nWe doing it like we did the previous time or we're going to try and do it through, uh, kick chat like?\nWe'll play for them.\nWe'll play for them.\nIt's easier.\nI think it's easier.\n$1,000 spends, uh, online shop.\nAnd we'll close that.\nBring that up.\nDo that.\nRight.\nSo, move that over.\nSorry.\nJust didn't expect this one.\nSo, just prepping.\nYou guys get 500 in the back.\nUm, if we, if you lose anyway.\nSo, oh god.\nOh, the music.\nAll right, so we play on easy or medium.\nWhat do we think?\nI think you've got to go easy when it's something like this, right?\nThousand then.\nI'll, I'll do the first one.\nHang on a minute.\nSo, it'll be the first go.\nNope.\nNo thousand.\nOh, we're doing a thousand.\nOh god.\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nThey get 500 if we lose.\nSo, it's just, it's one shot big over here, isn't it?\nOn on Rekt Radio.\nHoly [ __ ]\nOh, yeah.\nThis is we, we, we go through it quickly.\nYou see, this is Qualari, your number one volume trader this week.\nI'm playing for you.\nI'm semi-aggressive.\nI'm not quite Matt levels of aggressive, but let's, we'll jump.\nIt's a nice amount of money that, isn't it?\nJump.\nOh [ __ ]\nLet's go.\nI think one more jump and then I'll cash out.\nOne more jump then I'll cash out.\nOne more jump.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI'm feeling, I'm feeling good about that.\nThat'll be 1497.70 + 500 to Quamari.\nThere you go.\nGood play.\nWow.\nThat would have killed you.\nYou have got aggressive.\nAll right.\nCook about to run.\nWho's the, what's the guy's name?\nIt helps.\nRich LOL.\nRich.\nHe's, he's already rich, so I can, he's, I am rich, so I can push it.\nNo, I got to make him some money.\nAll right, I won't get too aggressive.\nLet's jump.\nYeah.\nOkay, go again, please.\nOne more.\nI'm going to go to 1697.\nSo, jump again.\nOne more.\nYeah, I think we cut it here.\nRich, we got you 700 extra dollars, bro.\n1,700 bucks is pretty good.\nLet's go.\nLet me write that down.\nI, I like to give the guys money, right?\nSo, I'd be pumped if I won, 1700 bucks on a stream.\nDo they get that plus the 500 or the 500 back?\nStream it without the 500.\nIt's only 500 is the backup, isn't it?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah, exactly.\nAnd Rich L, if, if I'm too big of a [ __ ], please flame me on CT.\nLike, Duke is such a p, Oh my god.\nOh my god.\nSorry, Rich.\nThat's a big one.\nSims, you'd have, you'd have been devastated if you'd have got to the end and died on that.\n[ __ ] bro.\nNo, he's happy.\nHe's laughing in the chat.\nSorry, bro.\nSims, you want to do this final one?\nYeah, but I'm aggressive, so I'll just, I'm, I'm going to the tracks.\nI'm not 500 bucks.\nWe're going to set this now.\nWe're going to go to the tracks and cash.\nAll right, if we die, Poppy, we die.\nI'm sorry.\nIs good.\nYou're my goat.\nDon't be sorry.\n[ __ ] hell.\nSorry.\nWell, I got 500 as a backup at least.\n500 back.\nWe're doing well.\nAll right.\nThat was a good show.\nGreat show.\nWe gave out, uh, nearly five grand of prizes there at the end.\nUm, and we'll be here next week.\nIdeally, I think everyone's going to be here next week.\nSo, we'll see you all then.\nThanks.\nWe're, we're trying to land everyone a streaming deal with Allan.\nI just tweeted at him.\nYou should sign Thread Guy and then we get the first serious show on Pumpfun.\nWe're different.\nWe're a different show.\nWe're a different show.\nAll right, guys.\nSee you next week.\nThanks for tuning in.\nSee you guys.\nThat was fun.\n",
