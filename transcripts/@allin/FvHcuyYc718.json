  "cleanText": "Our next guest needs no introduction.\nTony Robbins.\nYou have to figure it out.\nLike I always say, if you want to take the island, you burn the boats.\nI got a chance to work with the president of the United States, uh, Clinton, and he calls me one day, true story, and says, \"Tony, they're going to impeach me in the morning.\"\nHow many of you ever achieved a goal you worked your guts out for and then achieved it and went, \"Is this all there is?\"\nHorrific.\nHorrible.\nIt's great to uh meet you.\nThank you.\nYou're bigger in person.\nYou're a big man.\nCompared to what?\nA normal human.\nOkay.\nThey're large.\nThey're like see your hands.\nYeah.\nThere you go.\nThere you go.\nIt's like you're a big guy.\nUm, you're glad he just had his hand.\nIt could have got really interesting.\nYou're true.\nTrue.\nI mean, maybe not if he was in the cold plunge.\nYou never know.\nOkay, enough.\nWhen I told people you were coming, Yes.\nI got like a range of responses and your poor assistant chief of staff is in a total panic about all the questions I'm going to ask you.\nI don't care.\nYes, I know you don't care.\nBut I got the range of the infomercial guy.\nHe has had a profound impact on my life from very significant friends of mine who we know in common who have been to your seminars to he's kind of a guru self-help.\nIt's all kind of like snake oil.\nI want to know where this all started because my perception of you was the late night when I was growing up in the 80s, the infomercials.\nAnd then I looked into it and I started looking into the self-help space.\nYou actually were inspired by a self-help guru who you went to work for in the I think the late '70s.\nYeah.\nJim Ran.\nYeah.\nJim Ran.\nAnd um you have been on this for a while and a lot of the techniques that you studied are very real there.\nThese are real techniques in psychology and when I looked at them and I was looking at the history of it, you know, you look at Ralph Waldo, Emerson, uh self-reliance, uh Freud, Young, uh NLP, natural uh neural linguistic programming, and even Elron Hubard who took it in a different direction.\nA lot of these self-help things.\nAre you getting to a question?\nI am.\nI am.\nHe wants to show you that he spent two hours on Wikipedia before we started.\nI went down the rabbit hole.\nWikipedia.\nWho is Tony Robbins and why did you get addicted to all this self-help stuff and then it's kind of been packaged in a couple different ways in your life.\nSo I'm curious this sort of arc of how you got into this and then what you do for people now because my friend Mark Pinkis and then uh we have Beni off, friend of the show, my friend Kevin Rose, these guys and then civilians.\nI one of my wife's friends goes and runs over coals with you in Hawaii and she she's a makeup artist and she loves it and she can't shut up about it.\nSo tell me how you got into self-help, how you packaged it, and why you decided to be a coach and do these seminars instead of starting a a cult or religion.\nI got unpack that.\nYes, please.\nWell, people know me at different stages.\nI was on television every 30 minutes, 24 hours a day for about 12 years during infomercial days.\nAnd I hated infomercials, but there was no real vehicle, right, you could get out to mass number of people other than writing a book.\nAnd most people don't read.\nSo, but it started for me.\nI grew up in a pretty tough environment.\nI was born in downtown LA.\nI had four different fathers.\nI had a very powerful mom who I love dearly.\nI've since passed.\nUm, beautiful soul.\nI created a lot of my success to her.\nBut also, when she drank alcohol and took prescription drugs, she was a different person, very violent.\nI have a younger brother, younger sister.\nSo, I really became a practical psychologist in my youth, learning how to manage her emotions and her states and how to really get things done.\nAnd um I think probably the thing that changed my life the most though was when I was 11 years old, my fourth father, and he got fired from his job.\nAnd it was Thanksgiving.\nWe had no money and no food.\nWhen I say no food, we had crackers and peanut butter, but you know, not a Thanksgiving dinner, which kind of depressing.\nAnd my parents were fighting and, you know, saying things you can never take back.\nAnd I was trying to make my brother and sister not hear it.\nAnd my life was changed cuz someone came to the door.\nI opened a big guy, two bags of groceries in his hand and an un a frozen turkey uncooked in a pan on the ground.\nHe'd obviously carried and sat down.\nHe said, \"Is your father here?\"\nAnd I was like, \"Just one moment.\"\nAnd I thought it was going to be the most joyous moment, but my father was angry because he felt humiliated.\nHe looked at it as charity and said, \"We don't accept that.\"\nAnd long story short, the man said, \"I'm the delivery guy.\"\nAnd my dad had to take the food.\nAnd that day changed my life because my father left shortly thereafter.\nAnd I really loved him.\nHe's the one who adopted me and uh I carry his name.\nBut it also I our life is determined, I think, by the meanings we give to things.\nYou know, is this the end or the beginning?\nIs this person dissing me?\nAre they coaching me?\nAre they loving on me?\nWhatever you decide controls your life.\nAnd I was fortunate enough at that point that I came up with a different meaning.\nWe grew up in an environment I thought was a wealthy community.\nIt was very low middle class to say the least.\nAnd we were on the other side of the railroad tracks.\nAnd it looked like nobody cared and nobody, my father kept saying no one cares about anybody else.\nBut this was new evidence for me.\nIt was like if a stranger who doesn't even want credit is delivering my family Thanksgiving dinner, then strangers do care and I need to care about strangers.\nAnd so I promised myself that at 11 years old that someday I'd do this back and feed at least two families.\nAnd then you know I grew up and I started studying patterns.\nI started seeing that everything is a pattern.\nYou know all of you know as if you're an investor, if you're a great CEO, uh if you're a great dancer, musician, it's really because you recognize patterns.\nThings are no longer chaos for you.\nYou see what's going on.\nSo you have the power of anticipation.\nAnd then the second skill I think I try to teach this to my kids and grandkids.\nI have five kids and five grandkids.\nI have a 50-year-old daughter and thanks to co a four-year-old daughter and uh and I'm saying what do I need them to know?\nThe world is changing so fast.\nThey have to be able to recognize patterns.\nStep two, utilize them.\nThat's where the power is.\nAnd if you do it long enough, you play someone else's music long enough, you know, some of you starts to come through and you start to be a creator of patterns.\nThat's when you become masterful.\nThose are the people we know in investing.\nYou know their names or in business or anything else.\nAnd so once I learned that, I realized there's nothing wrong with people.\nWe just get caught up in patterns and we do them so long we think they're us.\nAnd it's hard to change you.\nEasy to change a pattern.\nAnd I got really good at it.\nAnd so I changed my body.\nI changed my finances.\nPeople started coming to me.\nAnd then gradually it became my full-time focus.\nAnd I began to have people calling me as I started producing results.\nAnd I'd get these athletes that would call like Serena Williams.\nAnd and she's melting down and she can't get on the court cuz her sister just died.\nAnd she's lost recently and she's, you know, she's got she's gunshy.\nAnd I got to right now turn her around and there's no net.\nSo fortunately, I've been able to do that over and over again.\nAnd it built my career and brought me to a lot of sports teams and now I own some of those sports teams, pieces of them.\nAnd um and but then I also started looking, okay, I started working with people that are depressed and suicidal and knock on wood.\nI don't know.\nDid any of you see Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru on Netflix?\nAnybody here?\nSo if you haven't seen it, you can see Thank you.\nYou see the work.\nBut we follow up 10 years later and you see the people are still in great shape because we're rewiring the way the brain works.\nIt's not a bunch of pump up.\nI do use energy because without energy, nothing changes.\nBut you can't just have energy.\nyou need strategy.\nAnd so as I did that, you know, I give you a perfect example.\nI'm 31 years old and career starting to sore.\nAnd then I I got a chance to work with the president of the United States, uh, Clinton, and he calls me one day, true story, and says, \"Tony, they're going to impeach me in the morning.\nWhat should I do?\"\nAnd I'm 31 years old, and the president's asked me, I said, \"Could you call me sooner?\"\nYou know, this is like tomorrow morning.\nBut because there's no net, my brain figured it out.\nYou have to figure it out.\nIt's like I always say, if you want to take the island, you burn the boats.\nAnd then I got good at Sorry, Tony.\nWhat What did you tell him?\nPardon me.\nWhat did you tell him?\nI can't tell you that.\nOkay.\nThat's that's a private thing I'll tell if you want to know.\nI don't share unless somebody shares.\nBut what I will tell you is I got good at studying businesses and became an entrepreneur.\nAnd so now I have 114 companies in ma massively different industries, but we do about $9 billion a little bit more in revenue.\nAnd I love the diversity.\nSo I get to work with athletes.\nI get the team you formerly have ownership in.\nhave a little piece of Peter Gerber is one of my dearest friends as you probably know and so I've gotten to work with you know some of the greatest athletes in the world some of the greatest musicians some of the greatest entertainers and the greatest entrepreneurs and I don't go there just to to teach them I go to learn can I ask you a societal question for a second okay so you've been in some ways diagnosing what ails people for let's say 40 years now yes every society has its own pothole and maybe you know teenag teenagers and young people today suffer from a very different thing that maybe Jason, myself and friedberg did at our ages.\nCan you diagnose the level of happiness and sadness and satisfaction, dissatisfaction that this current young generation has relative to other younger generations and where it's different and where it's the same?\nI don't think I'm the only one that can see it.\nI think expectations, you know, I always tell people expectations are what make you really unhappy.\nAnd we can't not have any obviously, but trade your expectations for appreciation, your life changes.\nBut our expectations now are controlled more by social media, especially that generation, right?\nSo they're seeing people that are incredibly wealthy and thinking that's who I should be and feeling like I don't have anything.\nI mean, what turned people in the Soviet Union against Soviet Union when they got access to seeing how the Westerners lived?\nThen things changed.\nWhen they didn't see it, it was okay.\nSo today we compare ourselves to others and in ways that are not real because like young girls that go on social media, you've seen all the studies, I'm sure, they get depressed because they're comparing to images that aren't even real.\nIt's fake.\nExpectations minus reality equals happiness.\nAnd what I really say is progress equals happiness.\nLike if you are growing, if you are going at something, even if you're not there yet and you are got to lose 50 pounds and you lose the first five or 10 or you're in a relationship and you finally face what has to be dealt with or you face your finances, there's a momentum that happens and an aliveness.\nI mean, ask all of you here and those of you in the room, how many of you ever achieved a goal you worked your guts out for and then achieved it and went, is this all there is?\nWho's had this experience?\nI'm curious.\nRight?\nThat's a horrific moment, right?\nHorrible.\nIt's worse than failure cuz most of us simply fail.\nWe get back up and figure it out.\nRight?\ncompletely.\nBut try this one for size.\nHow many of you achieved a goal that you worked your guts out for and you're really proud of it and you were euphoric?\nWho's had one of those?\nMy show hands some noise out there if you give it to me later.\nRight.\nSo the question is, how long did that good feeling last?\nDid it last 6 years?\nNo.\nA year.\nEuphoria.\nSix months.\nSix minutes.\n10 minutes.\nSix weeks.\nYeah.\nSix minutes.\nYeah.\nFor most people, it's been six minutes and about six weeks I found.\nYeah.\nAnd so why is that?\nBecause we're meant to grow in life.\nYou grow or you die.\nthe whole universe.\nThey have my laws.\nYou grow or you die.\nAnd when you grow, you have something to give.\nAnd unless you're giving something beyond yourself, if it's always a trade, you don't have any esteem for yourself.\nYou don't have any inner pride.\nBut when you have something to give, that's when life feels more meaningful.\nYeah.\nJonathan Heights, uh, book from years ago, uh, the happiness hypothesis.\nYes.\nA great study in there on economic progress being the best predictor of happiness.\nIt wasn't the absolute dollars you were earning each year that flatlined after a certain baseline standard of living.\nBeyond that standard of living once you were able to get food and housing and all the things you need to survive and thrive.\nWhat predicted happiness was how much things changed from year to year.\nThe rate of change that he's absolutely right in other studies.\nBut there are new studies that add another dynamic.\nIt's also affected by who is in your environment.\nAnd today who's in your environment because the social media is is not real.\nAnd so now we're in a place where people evaluate not by their circle of friends they hang out with.\nThat certainly plays a role, but even more so.\nAnd I've always tell people if\n\n\nIf you want to grow, get on the field with people tenfold of where you are and where you if you want to play tennis and you're good at tennis and you're fortunate enough to get to sit down with somebody who's world class like a Serena Williams friend of mine. If you go out and do that, you know you're terrible. But just to get on the court with her, you got to get great. If you play against somebody you're better than, it's only a matter of time before your skills go down as well. So I think our society people have an expectation today.\n\nI also, my original teacher, Jim Ran, a personal development speaker, more of a business philosopher, he, I went to one time when I was really young, just beginning with him, and I said, \"All my fathers are good humans. Why were we always broke?\" And I said, \"And I look at this, you know, billionaire hedge fund person, you know, and he made a billion dollars last year. And this school teacher only made in those days like $40,000.\" And he said, \"Tony, that's fair. But here's what I can suggest to you. We're all equal as souls, but we're not equal in the marketplace.\" And he said, \"If you go to McDonald's and you get a, you don't get a living wage, you're not supposed to. It's a first job. Anyone can do that job and learn it in an hour. But he said, \"If you find a way to add more value to people,\" because he said to me, \"Can someone make twice as much money in the same time?\" I said, \"Yeah, five times, 10, 100 times.\" He said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"The guy that made a billion dollars produced a 42% return. Did you know that? Those are people's futures. That was people's college educations. That was their retirements. He is worth it. You must become assessed on doing more for others than anybody else does.\" And so that's been my moniker for all my companies. And it's been the core. And I think that's what's missing to answer your question. It's like what what is life going to give me versus the Kennedy days of don't ask what you're going to do. How do you help a larger swath of society then unwind the addiction to SSRIs, the kind of doom loop, doom scrolling, like just the general malaise.\n\nYes. That then manifests in all these weird ways. The inability to talk to each other, the, you know, cut people off because they voted one way versus another. All this stuff just seems so, cuz all of the social media, the mobile, the social, everything's not going away. It's here. It's permeated, and it's not just going to disappear overnight. But if you study like the the youngest generation as they've come forward, they're getting off of even, they obviously they got off Facebook a long time ago. Their parents do that stuff, right? But they're not even on Instagram now. They're going to these individual places that are more intimate. They're wanting not everybody to know what they're doing there. The pendulum throws itself so extreme and then we correct. It's what we just experienced politically. It's the same thing. So, it's it's easy to rationalize that.\n\nBut I'll tell you, you know, Stanford came to me during the the COVID time, the period. And they came to me because two of their professors had gone through my Date with Destiny Center. It's a 5-day total immersion where you rewire yourself. Decide what you want. I don't tell you what your values are, how you going to live your life. And both of them had been on medication. Both were clinically depressed. And they came back and he said, \"They have no symptoms. They're off all their medication. How does this happen?\" So, we had this long conversation. And he said, \"Well, do you have some data?\" I said, \"Well, I have millions of graduates, you know, and stories.\" He goes, \"No, no, like scientific data.\" I said, \"No, but I'd be open to doing a study.\" So during co...\n\nOh, wow. To longitudinally follow the people that have... Yes. And so he took, but they put people in. They did their own study. Cuz I said, \"If we're going to do this, tell me what the standards, what do the meta studies show?\" Like how many people get well through traditional approaches of drugs and therapy? And you know, I don't know if you're aware of it. It's crazy. 60% of the people who use drugs or therapy to try and get out of depression make zero improvement. 60%. 40% improve, he shared with me, but the average improvement is 50%. Most are on drugs the rest of their life, and he goes, I said, \"You should be able to do that with a placebo,\" and he laughed and said, \"By me, it's true in fact,\" and he said, \"Yeah, sort of.\" And I said, \"Well, I know it sounds like hubris or arrogance, but it's not. I've just done this so long.\" I said, \"We will destroy that.\" I said, \"What's the best study you've ever done?\" They said it was John Hopkins now. I think it's been about eight years ago. And they gave people psilocybin, magic mushrooms, and and cognitive therapy for a month. I said, \"Well, something had to change that kind of biochemical shift, right?\" And it was the greatest up until that point, the greatest result they'd ever seen in psychiatry. At the end of 6 weeks, 53% of the people had no symptoms whatsoever of depression. Nothing like it in history. So I said, \"That's my target to beat.\" And I said, again, might sound arrogant, but I said, \"Enough experience. I will bet we do it.\" You set up the study with all the comparison groups, and he did, and they ran the study, and I'm proud to tell you that at the end of 6 weeks, 97% of the people had no symptoms whatsoever. 7% had symptoms, but they had lessened massively, but 17% had suicidal ideation coming in, and coming out, none did. They followed up a year later, 72% reduction in negative emotions a year after, I've not seen them, 51% increase in positive emotions.\n\nSo now we're doing it on business. They did a one-year study with 1,500 people. They just finished it, and you know, in business, you know, IBIDA is engagement, right? The most engaged employees and companies are there. And we've all seen that drop. If you're not familiar with it, we usually go three levels. You measure engagement, disengagement, which would be now we call it quiet quitting, and then active disengagement. That's hard quitting where they're in the company, but trying to harm it. The largest drop in history since COVID has happened on engagement, and the largest increase in active disengagement. They took the group in 750 of each group, test group versus normal group. In four, excuse me, in five days, they found a month later the engagement levels returned far above what they were pre-COVID, but more importantly, without any more interaction with me, because they changed their wiring over the next year, and they followed them for the full year, they they continue to increase their engagement.\n\nA lot of what you're doing is and has its roots in what we call today CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy, attribution theory, how you interpret what people are saying to you, but you also need a pause when you do have uh a reaction coming to you and just pausing for a second and then making sure you understand and checking the reality of that. These are techniques that you actually have in your programs. Yes, they do. But you, if you also don't change the physiology of the person, you have limited range. I'll give you an example. They sent a group and followed me for, I think, I think maybe explaining the attribution theory would be really good for the audience and why that's so powerful. Well, I I think if I may, just limited time, I think you, it's more important to understand physical change. Okay. Because your biochemical changes will last. If I ask you all where you were on 9/11, no matter what country you're in, if you're not in America, everyone knows where they were. They what they saw, who was there, right? There's a biochemical change. If I asked you where on 8/11, you don't have a clue. So, what they did is they followed me and they saw what happened to my body on stage 12 hours a day, four days in a row. They had me wear this huge device, and they took my blood and they took my saliva for hormones every hour on the hour. And they'd also done this with Tom Brady. The group has also done this with uh the Tampa Bay uh Lightning who've won multiple times. And what they found is what they call championship biochemistry. When Tom Brady's down by, you know, 10 points since the fourth quarter and he comes back to win, how does that happen? His biochemistry has an explosion of testosterone, which makes you remember everything. That's why it's retained, and it puts you in a place of total focus. But with testosterone, you usually also have the stress hormone of cortisol. In Tom's body and he goes there, the cortisol drops off the cliff. It's unheard of. They call it championship. And same thing happens Tampa. Same happens every time I get on stage, not sitting like this, but doing what we do. What's more important is they then decide to measure my audience, and they did it first before co, and then I started doing seminars digitally all around the world, like we have 1.3 million people for a 4-day seminar. I usually did 15, 20,000 person stadiums for 4 days, and now that's the size we're able to grow to and scale, and we figure how to make it work well. When they measured them in 15 different countries, it looks like it looks like music. They come in and we suddenly start to go up together and make the same response, same find of focus and the same cortisol drop, and that's why they believe it's lost. Same thing happens with engagement, right? It's a biochemical.\n\nSo I do believe in all the elements of cognitive therapy and neuro-linguistic program, there's so many, but without the unique thing that they saw I did and that tried to explain how it lasted is the biochemical shift. So pairing CBT with this physical activity, this intensity, yes, that is the secret. That makes total sense. Otherwise, it won't last, right? And you know, you can make it last by repetition, right? By, you know, affirming. This is why when we go on a retreat and they organize these corny corporate retreats, it's not corny that they want to do a thrilling experience and go white water rafting to help people bond because people's lives are so sedentary. They don't experience this. And that's why all you lunatics are jumping in ice cold bats every year. Yes. That's why you feel alive. You must have a very high like excitement level. Like you got to be in a helicopter and you got to jump in cold water to be to feel alive at this point. I've been doing the 18 years in the last 10 or 12 years. Everybody does it now. But yes.\n\nNo, but it's also I'm a biohacker. I have to be able to get up and do, imagine I I burn 11,500 calories, 11,300 calories on average in a day. I jump a thousand times. I'm in a stadium. I'm not just standing there. If you're standing there, you'll be bored out of your mind. I engage or I'm running up the walls. I'm there with everybody. I could strike at any moment. That's what keeps people fully alive. But when you do that, I'm jumping 1,000 times. I weigh 290 lbs. Every time you come down, they explain it's four times your body weight. So, it's a million pounds, you know, of pressure. And I'm doing that. I've been doing that since I was, you know, basically 19 years old. This is my 48th year doing it.\n\nIf you had been uh diagnosed by like the industrial psychological psychiatry complex these days, would they just have said you were like a kid with ADHD or something? What do you think? I don't know what they'd come up with. I'm a freak as far as they're concerned. I'm sure the scale. But you know what's nice now is I have virtually every psychological leader out of maybe a dozen of them have endorsed what we do. In fact, now therapists in various states in the United States can actually study my work, see the results because there's very few places you can see an intervention and then follow up and see what the result was a year later, and they get credits for that.\n\nIf you circle back to when Tom Cruise said, \"Hey, listen, you know, exercise, diet, uh, meditation,\" and he and he kind of laid out there's other ways to deal with depression, and everybody would like, \"What does he know? These doctors know better.\" And now the doctors have all come back to his position, which is, \"Let's focus on your diet, let's focus on your exercise, let's focus on your sleep.\" Yes. And let's focus on your meditation. Those four things will do more to you than any pill. Correct. In your estimation, 100%. Yet we have 60% of people in the country on a pill in some of these. And most of them have more than one. Anytime you combine three pills, you cannot predict the outcome in your body.\n\nAnd what about Tony? Then the move away from SSRIs now to psychedelics and psilocide. Like there's all these, it's all these curalls. Yes. Well, um, I'm sure you saw the cover of Newsweek a couple years ago. It talked about, was on the cover, and it said, \"SSRIs don't work.\" They don't. They've been proven not to work by the meta studies, but we're still given to millions of people. And the side effects are depression, sometimes suicidal. It's insane. So looking for something else to rewire your brain is why people are starting to either mildly dose or heavily dose or go on these pieces. But the problem there, there's nothing wrong with it. Anybody wants to do whatever they want to do. I'm not approved about how to do it. But I like the idea of being able to take charge and make conscious decisions. But I've had that experience. I went and investigated that myself directly. Went down, you know, into South America, had an experience. It was quite profound, but it's like, what are you going to do with it? Some people it just becomes another way to party, you know, and that then you're not going to get any results that really matter. If you're doing it with a therapist, with intentionality, with a guide, like I was, I was completely against it, and I met Tony Bosses um from uh was it Columbia or New York University, and I said, \"You know, I'm just not into drugs.\"\n\n\nYou know, I'm not a freak, but people around me overuse them and abuse them.\nSo, I, I've always just not done that.\nAnd he said, \"Tony, it's not a drug because a drug you take at it one, you know, you got to take it every day.\"\nHe said this, I'll show you.\nAnd he showed me videos.\nHe said, \"These are people that, he was working with people that have been diagnosed with cancer, terminal cancer, right?\nAnd he said, \"Watch this.\"\nHe said, \"I'm going to show you in advance.\nThis woman is an atheist.\nShe's not like a California atheist, like there might be some God in the trees or something.\nShe's a New York atheist.\nThere is no God.\"\nYeah.\nRight.\nAnd he shows me the video.\nYou know, they they do two different sessions.\nThey don't know which one's going to be it.\nAnd she comes out at the end of the session where she had the experience and she said I experienced God and and about 96% of the people say it's one of the three most profound experiences of their life.\nIt was for me.\nUm, and I used to I can handle anything, but the one thing I was weak at, I'll be honest with you, was like somebody dying cuz I had handled that within myself.\nAnd uh, so that's why I went to do it.\nAnd I I don't have a fear of dying.\nI don't want I don't want to die, but I don't have the fear of it before.\nAnd if you went through deep trauma in your childhood, psychedelics can, I'm told, take you right to that place and you will have to confront it.\nAnd that's why doing it in a safe environment, especially if you're a child of trauma with an alcoholic father, which I had as well, very challenging.\nUh, I don't recommend going to just a guru or somebody like when I went down in South America only because there are a lot of people that take advantage of women down there in this because once you're in that state, it's, you know, you're really, you don't know what's you're in a world, a different world.\nSo I really say you want to there are people now there's a big push at UCLA, they're they're they're doing it, Stanford, they're all studying it now and I think using it in that area make a difference but my point is you get the same results without it and I'm not suggesting people have to do it one way.\nYeah.\nTony, can I build on Freeberg's question which is happiness is sort of a rate of change problem.\nYes.\nYou're incredibly successful.\nYou're incredibly famous.\nYou have a great family.\nYou're really fabulously wealthy.\nThere's all this stuff.\nHow do you frame your mind in terms of this rate of change?\nSo you're seeing progress like do you do that for yourself?\nLike yes of course I think I think men and women it's a generalization but I think they evaluate life differently.\nI think most men have grown up in a hierarchal world some women do as well and they have an idea of where they think they should be at a certain time and most people are not there at times where if you're fortunate enough you're ahead ahead of the game.\nI got to the point probably 10 years ago where I had done all these things.\nI didn't have any less enthusiasm, but I didn't have anything that like what am I going to do now?\nAnd and I'd done philanthropy my whole life cuz, you know, I got fed, so I started feeding people.\nI did it at 17.\nI fed two families and then four and I got hooked on it.\nAnd then I got my little company involved.\nAnd then we got to two million people.\nAnd then 2 million from me and 2 million from, you know, the general public.\nAnd then when I was writing Money Master the Game, I wrote interviewed Ray Dalia, Carl and Warren Buffett, all the best in the business.\nAnd I I saw at the same time I'm interviewing these billionaires that the government cut food stamps now.\nIt's called the SNAP program.\nYeah.\nBy six I think it was $6 billion.\nIt means every family that needs food would have to go out with one week of food unless people like us step up.\nSo I called my foundation.\nI said, \"How many people have I fed in my lifetime?\"\nBecause I didn't know the number.\nThey said 42 million.\nI was like really gratified by that.\nBut I also was saying like, \"What if I did what I did in a whole lifetime in a year?\nWhat if I fed 50 million people in a year?\"\nAnd I was like, \"What if I fed a 100 million?\nWhat about that 100 million for 10 straight years and fed a billion people in the United States, richest country in the world, but we have about 20 million people that don't know where the next meal is going to come from.\nAnd I hooked up with Feeding America to deliver the food.\nAnd I'm proud to say we did it in 8 years.\nBut the problem hasn't gone away.\nAnd so now I hooked up with uh Governor Beasley when I was in the UAE.\nHe introduced me to Governor Beasley.\nNBZ did.\nAnd he explained to me that he ran the World Food Program.\nYes.\nHe he won the Nobel Prize for that.\nNBZ said, \"I want you to meet the only guy I know that's needed more people than you.\"\nI said, \"He's being a lot more than I am at the UN.\"\nBut we sat down and we became friends.\nAnd now I said to him, he normally 80 million people a year are at risk of dying.\nThis year it's 385 million because of the war in Ukraine.\nIt is the bread basket for most of Africa and there are 11 countries near famine right now.\nAnd you don't read about in the news because you're reading about something on somebody's knuckles, right?\nAnd um and I said to him, well, and then there's not enough fertilizer because Russia's been cut off and it made the price triple and farmers can't afford it.\nSo I said, we need a period of time to get to sustainability.\n10 years, let's say.\nHow many meals would we need in the meantime just to close the gap?\nHe said, Tony, 50, 60, maybe 70 billion meals.\nSo I said, why don't we do a 100red billion meals challenge?\nI said, I did a billion meals.\nI did it supposed to be in 10 years.\n100 million years, 100 million meals a year.\nI wasn't a billionaire when I started.\nI've been blessed obviously, but there's got to be 99 other people like me who care or businesses or countries.\nAnd so we began that process 2 and a half years ago.\nIn the beginning, it did not go well, but I'm proud to tell you in the first year and a half, we got 30 billion meals.\nI'll be announcing at the UN coming up this fall.\nU I can't tell you the numbers supposed to wait till then, but more than double that.\nSo we're well beyond that.\nBut right now in Duffer, thank you.\nThank you very much.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nI appreciate your I appreciate your applause.\nBut I think also we want sustainability and any of you that want to donate, I'll match.\nI do it at Feeding America.\nYou donate a million dollars, I'll match it.\nYou can put a $10 in, I'll match it.\nBut now Darur, you know, people, you know, we get these war zones now.\nAnd there are people right now surrounded by those rebels.\nA million people right now.\nAnd no one's funding anything because no one can get they'll shoot the plane out of this guy.\nSo, we just Governor Beasley and I have just teamed up and we have found this group, this military group that's retired that want to do good works.\nThey've done it for a while and we're buying the C130s.\nI'm donating the first million meals for the week.\nI got two people to match me.\nSo, we have three weeks worth of food.\nWe're going to fly in and airdrop all that food.\nI'm going to UAE because I know the leaders there.\nWe're going to Saudi Arabia.\nI'm going to say, \"You can't shoot this down.\nThis is not political.\nThere's no weapons.\nIt's just food.\"\nAnd we're going to prove it works.\nAnd then we have a tour June 7th through the 15th with all those leaders to get them to hopefully step up.\nKar's already stepped up and said they're going to give 30 million and we're going to save those lives.\nSo people will die otherwise, you know, and everybody just gives up.\nI'm not a person who gives up.\nBut I just want to say that to answer your question for anybody, I think we all need moonshots.\nIt's like we all need something to go for.\nYeah.\nYou've ever achieved a goal and then there's a drop because we're made to keep growing.\nAnd so when I did that, then I was like, \"Okay, my wife and I, we we found some kids that were trafficked.\nWe couldn't believe it.\"\nAnd I said, \"I want to save as many people in the city I grew.\"\nAnd it was 30,000 people.\nSo now we're 76,000 kids we saved.\nI worked some of the best organizations.\nHelped make a movie some of you may have seen uh last year that was or two years ago um that was all about this process.\nAnd it and it it blew up on July 4th.\nYou know, the sound of Is it hard for you to frame your mind on a goal that's measured differently than the thing that you were successful at?\nWhat do you mean?\nOh, my goal is to make money.\nAnd then you make a ton of money and then you're like, now my goal is to do something philanthropic.\nIt's a totally different measurement.\nAnd what happens, as you said, even if you're motivated by it, a lot of the people around you may be very unmotivated by it and almost pull you back from it.\nWell, I'll tell you, I've done this my whole life.\nI had um I Peter Goober's our mutual friend, you know, Peter.\nPeter, one time I was arguing or not arguing, sharing with him my frustration that people weren't helping these children or helping, you know, trafficking because it because it sounds so bad.\nYou don't want to hear about it.\nAnd Peter really was a student.\nHe said, Tony, he said, you taught me this.\nPeople do things for different reasons.\nSome people donate because they want their name on the wall.\nSome people donate because they're guilty because they inherited their money.\nBut some people donate because they really care.\nYou don't care.\nJust meet their needs.\nAnd so I found like I had a friend that was on a plane the other day.\nI've known him 44 years and person's reading my book.\nUh this is my book I did interviewed 150 people who are the top regenerative scientists in the world, right?\nSo it's a big book 700 page and this guy's marking it and he's you know just going crazy.\nAnd my friend loves to see how people respond.\nHe says, \"So what do you think of that book?\"\nAnd he goes, \"Oh my god, stem cells and this and that or you can't believe what you can do with your body and change.\"\nAnd he goes, \"What do you think of the author?\"\nHe goes, \"Oh, he seems like such a nice guy.\nHe took nothing from all his books.\nHe donated it all.\nHe feeds all these people.\"\nWell, but he is rich, he said.\nSo, it must be easy for him.\nAnd my buddy turned to him and said, \"What if I told you I'd known Tony for 44 years?\nI knew him when he had $10 in his pocket.\nDidn't know he's going to give his next meal.\nAnd he gave five it to a guy in the street.\nAnd that he taught me if I won't give a dollar, you know, dime out of a dollar.\nI'm never going to give a hundred million out of a billion.\"\nAnd you start now.\nYou start now and your life is different.\nSo, I invite people to find a moonshot.\nAnd mine started with feeding two families and then it becomes four and then it becomes larger.\nBut now my economics, you know, are obviously extraordinary.\nBut what drives me now is all the things I'm doing and I need tens of millions of dollars for what I donate.\nLet me ask you a question on that, which is how do you think about the relationship between focus and effectiveness.\nA lot of folks and my experience has been the more we try and do the more the breadth of the things we try and do, the harder it is to do any one thing exceptionally well and have these outsized returns.\nAnd there's a nonlinear relationship between focus and outcome.\nThe more you concentrate your time, energy, capital on one thing, it becomes nonlinear how well that thing does when you're an effective person.\nYou have movie projects, book projects, speaking engagements, businesses, ownership and sports teams, people calling you.\nHow do you think about focusing your time and the effectiveness that you can then have in the things that you choose to do?\nI believe in concentration of power, but I don't have the limitation of thinking it has to be every moment on just one thing.\nSo, I actually built a system for myself when I was really young and I had my my second business.\nI wasn't doing well at my first one, so I started a second one.\nVery brilliant.\nIt's like saying I'm now terrible parents.\nLet me have another kid.\nThat's what most people do as entrepreneurs.\nSo, but I knew I needed to take control of my time.\nSo, I took these time management courses and they, you know, you have a little book in those days and your A, B, and C priorities.\nAnd I did it for about two weeks.\nAnd then after a while, I was like, there's no way I can do everything on my list.\nAnd I was frustrated.\nWho can relate to this by the way in your own life?\nRight?\nAnd so I was like I said, every time management system does the same thing.\nI don't know if it's digital or not.\nYou start with the same question.\nNow thinking is nothing but the process of asking and answering questions.\nNow as I said that you're going to think and you're ask yourself is that true or not?\nAnd you're going to evaluate it through your references.\nAnd that's a question isn't it?\nWe could take you all way down the line but for simple sake the question of what I need to do is the wrong question.\nSo I will tell you this when President Clinton M said what should I do?\nAnd I taught\n\n\nI said, I need to control my focus. Concentrate it. But I also need to have purpose behind it because, you know, purpose is stronger than object. I'm going to make a billion dollars for what though? The purpose, that's where the energy in the fuel is. And then I need a map. I called it RPM, like increasing your RPMs to get from here to there. And you know the result. Then I ask what do I want? What's the result measurable? Why am I doing it? And then what's the map, the massive action plan? And then I go find the 20% of things will give me 80% of the progress. And then I put things in categories. I have companies in categories. I have my family life in a category. My body's in a category. And every week I predetermine what are the most important outcomes for the week. But when you do that, you are able to have that concentration of power. And I where I am, I'm there 1 million%. And I found that skill of concentration doesn't have to be just one thing. If like in your businesses, you get great leaders. Obviously, I couldn't do all these things myself. Um, but when I've got great, you know, when you got partners that are extraordinary in the health area, you know, I created this company called Fountain Life and I got Peter Diamandis as my partner. He's a genius. I partnered uh with Sam Nazarian, some of you know from SPS, right? He created Mandreon and SLS hotels and we're building 15 extraordinary luxury hotels around the world where you can go and be scan and everything there.\n\nNow I love it. Even though if it's too much, you love it. And I have time for my daughter, which I adore, right? She's four years old. I'm saying it in slightly in jest cuz you are hyperefficient. You got this crazy energy level. There is a theory that sometimes be people become a little too addicted to success and to you know improving themselves. Do you ever stop and just like enjoy the day and not try to improve everything? You ever stop and just like laugh and maybe enjoy some sushi and punk golf with your friends and play some cards or does everything have to be the 78th millionth meal and person you saved? No. Well, there's a part of me that's that way for sure. Really? What do you do? No, I there's a part of me the first part that's as crazy as you describe, but there's another part of me that I value love and relationship above all else. Got it. So, like, you know, Peter's one of my dearest friends for 35 years. He was down here in Miami. Called me up and we had everything booked. I moved everything and we spent two hours just staying out together cuz I love him dearly. He's 82, 83 years old right now. I don't know a better human being. He's my priority. My daughter's my priority. Um my outcomes change when there's something more important, right? That's there. But I've also learned that I have to be able to turn the switch off and I do that. And I do that. Ray Dal is a good friend and you know learning to meditate was something I thought I'd never do in my life. But I've developed a simpler pattern I developed for myself and meditation I start my days with. I have to take care of my body and when I'm doing those things and I also when everybody else goes to bed that's when I get my thinking time and so from midnight till 3 or 4 for me is usually my time to. Are you like a three hour sleeper like a four hour? No, like four and a half to five. Not ideal, five is ideal for me, but uh I can certainly do that. That's always been that way. That's sort of you know not when I was a kid, but once I discovered my passion for you know you've all heard the phrase, right? The two most important days of your life, the day you're born, the day you discover what you're born for. And when I discovered that, the energy in my body changed radically. Do you think about um I'm curious, uh mortality a lot. I know you're into the stem cells. You're you know, you're we're all getting to a certain age and we're all going to the same destination and uh looking back on your life and then finding meaning in that. I know some people our age start thinking about legacy. Does that like matter to you? And are you thinking about, hey, how many years do I have left? I never thought of that till about 64. I'm 65 now. Uh I never did. So just in the last year you started thinking about it last year. Was there something that caused that to happen? My daughter, I think having my daughter come along. I had her at 61. You had a daughter at 61. Yeah. She's four years old. Four years old. Wow. Yeah. So I've got a 50-year-old daughter and a Got it. I was confused by the math when you said all that and I was asking the question cuz you know in your brain it's all questions and answers.\n\nI told my wife originally I said I'm going to have a kid by 50. I said I I don't want to be there at my kids's high school reunion or excuse me graduation and I'm you know 70 years old and I'll be 80 when I do that piece but I look at people like Peter or Steve Win like I have a whole group of friends that are in their 80s that are Peter's doing more today than he did when I when he was 45. Yeah. And so I look at that and say but but you got to take care of your body. And so and there are things you don't predict. I my eye may look a little weird to some of you and may not notice, but uh about 3 weeks ago, no five weeks ago, I starting to feel irritation in my bladder and hard time breathing. It was very weird and I'm very, you know, I have a really intense way. I do hyperaric oxygen cryotherapy. So, it's really weird for me not to have that. And um so I went and got tested at found life where we have our stuff and they found I had this massive amount of arsenic in my body like a zero to five was they measure it. 50 would be off the charts. I was 3:45 and it was so bad the first thing he said is you got to watch your eyes and 5 days later my uh retina detached which can make you blind. So I went in for emergency surgery here in Miami, one of the best doctors out here and normally you have to take the surgery and then you have to lie on your stomach for a week and not get up looking down because they put this gas behind the retina. Oh my god. But fortunately I I Bobby Kennedy I put him together with Trump. He's a good friend. I called him. He got me with top guys at two different hospitals. They said, \"This is the guy. We got it all together.\" And he said, \"I think this is not as effective. It's not like 90% effect. It's like 70, but if it works, you can.\" He goes, \"I can't imagine you lying on your stomach for seven straight days and nights, not moving.\" I said, \"I can't either.\" And he said, \"If I do this, it's like a belt around your eye, and you'll be able to sit up at least.\" So, that was only three and a half weeks ago. And so, this eye is still having some pieces. So, of course, that made me pay attention. But yesterday I operate I found out from Fountain Life there is a new approach to your immune system because all this is coming out because my immune system was affected by these metals. By the way all of you have if you could give yourself a gift you should get tested for metals. There are so many metals in our food. There are all these great blood tests you can do with fountain other services and you can do them every six months for $500. And our doctors never told them to do this. They just would like be like oh yeah your blood works good. But when you think you're aging, often what it is is poisons in your body, metals in your body. It's so crazy. So there I want everybody to know about this. There's a name man named Dr. Xiao and I've I've seen everything. I wrote Life Force 150 of the best regenerative doctors in the world know about I know of them all. I've interviewed them all. This to me is like the number one thing to go to. So he has created this. I've done stem cells. I healed my shoulder with stem cells. I didn't have to go through surgery. But he does this what he calls re-education of your immune system. my beta cells were through the floor from all these metals. So now all the other things your body would fight off are coming through, right? And now my whole body was going in reaction. So I said, \"There's an answer. I'm going to detox.\" And I'm proud to tell you and they told me it could take two years. It took five weeks and I've got all the metals down to normal levels at least now, which I'm so thrilled about. But then what I'm going to do for my immune system? So Dr. Zho, he's been around. He he discovered the stem cells that are in the blood, not MSE cells, but these blood cells. And he's worked 25 years to do it. I've never seen anything like it in my life. He does plasma feresis. You probably have heard of it where they take blood out and they put it through a filter and it's can be very useful. I've had that before. But what he does, he takes your blood through and he takes your white blood cells, your immune system out overnight. He puts it through a filter with cord stem cells. You don't actually put someone else's cord stem cells in you. It's the intelligence that gets transferred and then it puts it back in your body and then they spread and change your immune system back 20 years. That sounds like a ridiculous uh promotion. This guy's not a promoter at all and it's all science. But I watched I what got me to go there is my um one of the people my Helen Dr. Helen from our place at Fountain Life showed me she said Tony I think this is what you got to do. She's on this ALS patient. ALS is usually you know it's a it's a death sentence and this guy's shaking and he can't take his hands above here. He does the process. Three weeks later he's doing this. No exaggeration. They do type 1 diabetes and turn it around. any autoimmune diseases there and most of aging is really the breakdown of the immune system. That's why we're seeing so many cancers after COVID and the injections. A lot of young people, these turbo cancers are happening because their immune systems have been harmed. And so now everything starts to shake up. When people think about aging, it's really immune system. So the type of people are going with alipcia where they have no hair. This one I met her and she got a full and she's 70 years old, got all her hair back. It's in New Jersey and he's already at sta he's on an IND. So he's on stage three though. has gone through his stage three. He's doing his submittal and we're going to bring it to fountain life here because there's nothing like I've seen it. But there are things like that like if you stay well and take care of yourself now over the next 5 to 10 years, the kinds of transformations are going to allow us to be in a position where every year you could be a year younger at least maintain where you are. I mean it's not it's not science fiction. Freeberg talks about this all the time on the show like we're like this very interesting generation. We're 10 years behind you or maybe 15 in some cases. Um but or even 20 actually I think um but the we're this generation that we actually might get to benefit from some of these incredible technological advancements.\n\nYou absolutely will.
