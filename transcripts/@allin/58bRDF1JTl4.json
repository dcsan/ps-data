  "cleanText": "Does the power reside with the President to make large-scale, or, you know, riffs, or do they have to consult Congress first?\nYour thoughts on this issue?\nIt's an incredibly important ruling, incredibly right.\nI think President Trump should have absolute leeway to decide how the people that report to him act and do their job.\nIf you take a step back, Jason, there are more than 2,000 federal agencies, employees plus contractors, I think, number almost 3 million people.\nIf you put 3 million people into 2,000 agencies, and then you give them very poor and outdated technology, which unfortunately most of the government operates on, what are you going to get?\nYou're going to get incredibly slow processes.\nYou're going to get a lot of checking and double-checking, and you're going to ultimately just get a lot of regulations because they're trying to do what they think is the right job.\nSo since 1993, what have we seen?\nRegulations have gotten out of control.\nIt's like a 100,000 new rules per some number of months.\nLike, it's just crazy.\nSo eventually, we all succumb to an infinite number of rules that we all end up violating and not even know it.\nSo if the CEO of the United States, President Trump, isn't allowed to fire people, then all of that stuff just compounds.\nSo I think that this is a really important thing that just happened.\nIt allows us to now level set how big should the government be?\nBut more importantly, the number of people in the government are also the ones that then direct downstream spend that make net new rules.\nAnd if you can slow the growth of that down, you're actually doing a lot.\nIn many ways, I wish Elon had come in and created Doge now.\nLike, could you imagine if Doge was created the day after this Supreme Court ruling?\nIt would have been a totally different outcome, I think, because with that Supreme Court ruling in hand, these guys probably would have been like a hot knife through butter, Travis.\nSo, I, I think it's a big deal.\nExcept that ruling doesn't happen without Doge.\nThat Doge caused that ruling to occur.\nTrue.\nWell, the EO did, you could have passed all that was all Doge style, though.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nIf, if they wasn't firing people, yeah, they probably wouldn't have felt the need, to your point, Travis, to actually file this.\nTravis, if you are living in the age of AI efficiency right now, operations of companies is changing dramatically.\nCan you imagine telling somebody you can be CEO, but you can't change personnel?\nThat's the job.\nYou get to be CEO, but you just can't change the players on the team.\nYou can buy the Knicks, but you can't change the coach.\nNo, you can grow it.\nYou just can't shrink it.\nIt's like a, it's like running a unionized company, which actually does exist, or largeized companies where you can't do any of these things, right?\nDo they still exist, or are they all gone?\nThey're going quickly.\nYeah, probably.\nI think this just gets back to what, what is actually Congress authorizing when a bill occurs.\nAnd there's certain things that are specific and certain things that aren't.\nAnd I don't, I'm not sure that in a lot of these bills, it's not very specific about exactly how many people must be hired.\nAnd so if it's, I'm just doing the common man's sort of approach to this, which is like, if, if the law says you have to hire X number of people, then that is what it is.\nIf the law says, here's some money to spend, here are the ways in which to spend it, but it's not specific about how many people you hire, then that is different.\nYeah.\nIt should be outcome based.\nHey, here's the goal.\nHere's the key objectives, right?\nTravis, Travis is totally right.\nLike there are, there's a variety of different laws, some with incredible specificities, some with very broad mandates.\nThe Constitution clearly says that all executive power resides in the president of the United States.\nPeriod.\nThere's no exceptions there.\nHowever, Congress does appropriate money, and post-Watergate, many people think Congress has the power to force the president to spend the money.\nAnd you can debate that.\nYou can debate it on a per statute basis, and that will be more nuanced, and that's going to get litigated whether the president can refuse to spend money that Congress explicitly instructed him to spend, sometimes called empowerment.\nThat's a very interesting intellectual debate.\nThis one's a little bit easier.\nIt'll get more complicated again, like this EO is only approved to allow for the planning.\nI think the vote might be closer.\nI think there's still a majority on the Supreme Court for the actual implementation, but it may not be 8-1 when there's a specific plan that has to navigate its way through the courts again.\nYeah, it's super fascinating.\nYeah.\nI wonder if they're going to get to the point where they're going to say in every bill, you need to hire this number of people to hit...\nI don't, I don't know if they can.\nLike that's where it gets borderline unconstitutional.\nLike where you actually prescribe that the president in the exercise of his constitutional duties has to hire a certain number of people, that feels pretty precarious.\nWell, I, I'm not sure, Keith.\nThat's just like they prescribe a whole bunch of other things, like you must, you must appropriate money for to this specific institution to do this specific work.\nBut that's not an executive function.\nLike if you said, like the secretary of state has to have x number of employees doing something.\nThe secretary of state is your personal representative to conduct foreign affairs on behalf of the president of the United States.\nIt gets a little bit more messy as you translate it to people, um, that the president should, I mean, yes, Congress does set, you know, which people are subject to Senate confirmation, what their salaries and compensation bans are.\nSo it's, it's never going to be fully binary where the president can do whatever he wants, and it's never gonna, I don't think it'll be constitutional for Congress to mandate and put all kinds of handcuffs on the president.\nWell, then you, you also have performance that comes in here.\nWhat if you look at the Department of Education?\nYou say scores have gone down.\nWe've spent this money.\nWe're not getting the results.\nTherefore, these people are incompetent.\nTherefore, I'm firing them for cause, and I'm going to hire new people.\nHow are you going to stop the executive from doing that?\nThere's been a bunch of litigation, you know, in parallel to this litigation about the president's ability to fire people.\nAnd for the most part, the Supreme Court's basically, with maybe the exception of the Federal Reserve chair, said that the president can fire pretty much anybody he wants.\nI mean, that's the way to go is like, I mean, I hate to be cut, but if the results aren't there, I think if they're presidential, yeah.\nIf they're a presidential appointee, the president should be able to fire you at will.\nJust like if you were a VP at one of our companies, the CEO should be able to fire you at will.\nBut what about Keith?\nIf the whole department sucks.\nHey, you guys were responsible for early education.\nYou had to put together a plan.\nThe plan failed.\nEverybody's fired.\nWe're starting over.\nLike, you should be allowed to do that.\nHow are we going to have an efficient government?\nSome of these departments were created by congressional statute, like the Department of Education in 1979.\nAnd you're right, every single educational stat has got worse in the United States since the department was created.\nBut there is a law on the books that says there shall be a department of education.\nSo you may have to repeal\n",
