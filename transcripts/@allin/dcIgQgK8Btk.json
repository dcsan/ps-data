  "cleanText": "Chim, any thoughts here on the dollar?\nI think the dollar has devalued 50% in the last 35 or 40 years.\nSo, I think it's somewhat useful to look at any single couple of months in time, but this has been a one-way trade for a very long time.\nAnd it's probably important to understand why that is.\nAnd I think it generally has to do with the fact that the United States finances a lot of growth, and that has been the right decision.\nSo unless you see a complete collapse in the currency, I suspect that this decay continues to happen.\nSo the question is, is it a bad thing?\nAnd the answer is it depends because if asset prices increase faster than the dollar devalues, you're still ahead.\nYou may not be ahead as much, but you're still ahead.\nAnd if you look at asset prices in the United States relative to asset prices any place else in the world, it is the flight to quality, which is to say that it is the thing that everybody wants to own.\nAnd you see that in the equity markets, you see it in real estate, you see it in hard assets.\nSo, I don't know.\nI think that it's part of the fact that until we run surpluses and or completely eliminate the debt, there will always be a reason to be somewhat short the dollar.\nBut the reality is that a lot of people still want to own these assets more than they want to own any other asset.\nAnd those assets are dollar denominated.\nAnd so as long as that continues to hold in the push and pull, it'll be a slow bleed, but it's probably manageable.\nAnd that's just sort of like the mathematical trend of it all.\nSo I don't know, unless there's some like cataclysmic collapse in asset prices, I think that this is just a thing that you have to deal with.\nIt's sort of like the carry of it all.\nAnd it happens.\nThere's all kinds of other trades where you sort of pay a carry, and that's okay.\nIs there a relationship you can explain to the audience between the stock market ripping and the dollar devaluing?\nWell, I think the reality is that, you know, if you think about a country that all of a sudden has to pay a tariff.\nSo, let's take the Vietnamese example that Friedberg said.\nLet's just say that they had to prepay one year of it just to make the math simple so you can understand.\nThey have to come up with 23 odd billion dollars I think is what Friedberg the number that you said or something like that.\nSo yeah, like 26 billion on 130.\nYeah.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to sell dollar denominated assets that you already own and you're going to generate those US dollars and then you're going to send it to the United States Treasury.\nSo you may be selling bonds.\nSo you would think, okay, well that's not really good for asset prices.\nOkay.\nBut then what you quickly realize is that all of that is far outweighed by the fact that all the rest of the stuff that you own, whether it's gold denominated or whether it's in local currency denominated, you want to actually go and buy these dollars because you want assets that are safe in turbulence and volatility.\nAnd so would you rather belong the Vietnamese dong or the Vietnamese equity markets?\nTo a degree, yes.\nBut if you have obligations that the Vietnamese government needs to fund, their central bank is probably deciding that they need to be long US bonds and fixed income and other people who hold assets in that country are probably going to be, you know, on a weighted basis adding exposure to the United States while all of this stuff is happening.\nWhy?\nBecause you're seeing the balance sheet of America burgeoning and growing.\n23 billion from Vietnam, tens of billions over here, tens of billions over there.\nIt all adds up.\nSo again, I I think that this is like a very complicated multivariate problem, but the net takeaway is that the dollar devaluation is not something that's new.\nIt is a phenomenon that has existed through market cycles for 50 plus years.\nIt's a decay that has happened and will continue to happen.\nSo I think the way that I think about it is there's a drag, but can the drag be overcome by the increase in asset values of the hard assets that are dollar denominated?\nAnd the answer is yes and meaningfully so.\nAnd so as long as that's the case, I think you're going to continue to have a bid for equities.\nIf all of a sudden the MAG 7 decided to delist and not be American companies and all of a sudden showed up in the CAC 50 in France, yeah, we'd be in big trouble.\nBut I don't think that's going to happen.\nAnd so as long as you know there's American ingenuity and American supremacy, again, which goes back to the other thing, which is we can't kill these golden geese, nor should we kill the emerging and growing golden goose, which is AI.\nAnd as long as those things are the same, there will be a constant bid for American assets.\nAnd that will keep the enterprise of America going for far longer than most people would guess.\nUp to a point, but pull up pull up this chart that I said.\nThis is the Yeah, I think that this is why Buffett sort of speaks about this in these extremely long arcs that you're always ultimately going to be on the wrong side of the trade betting against the United States.\nAnd it's probably important to then say, well, what would a boundary condition be?\nI don't think the boundary condition is the dollar.\nI actually don't think the boundary condition is the debt.\nI think the boundary condition is if something were to happen with the quality of the human capital inside of the United States and its inability to innovate, then we're probably in trouble.\nBut even that story will take 50 to 100 years to play out.\nI just think for most of our lifetimes, this is a safe trade because it's a winning trade.\nFree.\nWell, I mean, it's winning if you can put up with the currency dropping 11% in six months.\nAnd if you pull up this chart and and I get it, Jimoth, I I agree.\nBut I mean, look, businesses are booming in India.\nBusinesses are booming in China.\nBusinesses are booming in other countries now in the way that businesses used to boom strictly in the US.\nThere are other markets that seem to be having their day.\nAnd you can see this number, which I think is a really striking number.\nIn the last 10 years, US treasuries held by foreign holders has declined from 34%.\nThis is a good%.\nI mean, it's good in one context.\nYou're But my point is people, foreign countries and foreign businesses and foreign investors only holding US treasuries as much as nothing bad.\nThere's nothing bad about this chart.\nThis is only a good thing.\nThis chart shows that people don't want to hold US treasuries.\nNo, this chart shows that foreign governments and central banks have less and less influence on the direction of American fiscal and monetary policy.\nBetter.\nThat's better.\nSo, who's going to buy our debt?\nIt turns out that when you're the largest economy and you're growing, there's a lot of internal people that that will do it, right?\nSo, I mean, that's a key point here, which is means that the debt's going to get more expensive if there's a smaller market.\nThat's not necessarily true either.\nOkay.\nWell, one thing's true is that we're investing a lot of money and there's a lot of dry powder.\nThe amount of money being invested into data centers and AI and the amount of cash that's moving into investment specifically in our borders that has to be accreative, right?\nYeah.\nThe amount of cash in money market funds probably exceeds the sum total of all of the equity markets around the world.\nThat's insane.\nWell, and it's like and now people are talking about building 10, 20, 30 billion worth of data centers and, you know, nuclear power plants again.\nSo, there's something going on here with American exceptionalism.\n",
