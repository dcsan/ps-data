it.\nLove you.\n[Music]\nAll right everybody, welcome back to the number one podcast in the world after Tucker Carlson's amazing podcast.\nThat's right.\nTucker is back here on the All-In podcast with Chamath, Jason, your chairman dictator and the Zar DavidSacks.\nNot from the White House, he's from the suite, but he's here back on the program looking great.\nLook at the collar.\nBrion.\nI ordered three or four bronies after last week's show, guys.\nI did.\nI'm getting in the Brony.\nWell, I have the all- in expense accounts now.\nWhat' you call it?\nBrony.\nBrion.\nHe'll be paying for it over

performance.\nThank you for coming back.\nWe got a lot of crazy feedback from the private equity housewives, but I got more feedback.\nThey love me.\nBut you know what?\nYou're in you're in deep.\nyou're in deep because I I'm here in LA and the Los Angeles studio wives group is really really pissed off at you because they feel that they're the problem.\nThey feel they're a much bigger problem than private equity housewives.\nSo, Hollywood Studio heads wives versus private equity wives.\nI know some of them um and they're absolutely a bigger problem, but there are fewer of them.\nGod, it's kind of hard to get critical mass.\nYeah, exactly.\nThey're they're a smaller threat.\nThey're kind of an elite unit.\nYou know what I They're like Delta Force.\nGot it.\nThey have less money, too.\nYou know, they don't get as much in the divorce as these private equity wives.\nGot it.\nSo, they they're coming in like a SWAT team.\nIf you want to send them in to deal with a very specific issue, great.\nBut they're not going to cause as much bedum globally as the private.\nThey cause a lot of misery though, as one McKenzie Bezos.\nExactly.\nOh my god.\nAll right.\nListen, let's get a plug in here.\nAll-in summit, fourth year.\nTucker's coming this year, I hope.\nUh, September 7th to 9th in Los Angeles.\nThe goal, have the world's most important conversations, yada yada yada, blah blah blah.\nApply for a ticket.\nAllin.com/ yada yada yada or allin.com/summit to apply for a ticket.\nFreeberg is out this week.\nSo, Tucker is here and my lord, a lot going on in the news.\nLet's start with the immigration protests slash riots slash ICE Raids in Los Angeles.\nI'm actually here last Friday.\nProtests broke out after ICE raided Home Depot, a fashion wholesaler.\nIn total, 44 people were arrested by ICE.\n10 times as many, 400 and counting, from the protests.\nThey even ran into uh ICE that is ran into a strawberry field in Oxnard uh to just randomly pick people up.\nIt seems uh at least a half dozen Whimos were vandalized and burned.\n20 plus businesses looted and uh Whimo narrowed their area and it's spiked to 30-minute wait times.\nUh so that's a first world problem.\nRiders throwing bricks, Molotov cocktails, shooting fireworks at law enforcement.\nCompletely unacceptable.\nTwo men were charged with throwing molotov cocktails at officers.\nTrump deployed the National Guard, 2,000 at first, then 4,000 apparently.\nAnd uh apparently there's a battalion of Marines here, 700 of them.\nKaren Bass instituted a curfew downtown LA 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.\nAnd uh prosecutors, federal prosecutors that is, are trying to identify hundreds of people.\nNuome Bass denounced the raids obviously and uh they're blaming Trump for escalating the situation.\nTrump and members of the White House responded by calling out California's weak leadership and now we have protests popping up everywhere else.\nNew York, Chicago, Austin, DC.\nTucker, you grew up in Southern California, I think.\nYou I did.\nYeah.\nLA and La Hoya.\nI mean, are these riots more or less than a Lakers championship?\nUh how concerning are they to you?\nWho's to blame?\nWell, as measured by violence, they're less profound than, you know, what happened in 2020 after George Floyd died.\nThey're way less dangerous than say the Watts riot um or the LA Riots, but they're much more profound.\nI mean, it it really does.\nThey're certainly a bigger deal than anything that happened in Fort Sumpter, for sure, which kicked off the bloodiest war in American history.\nThe federal government has as a core duty uh the right and responsibility to enforce immigration law and police the borders.\nThat's what the government is.\nThat's what the federal government is really.\nAnd so if you contest that, it is like a threat to disunion fundamentally.\nI mean, I think there's a lot at stake.\nAnd we reached this point because a series of paradoxically weak federal governments allowed sanctuary cities to continue literally for decades.\neach one its own form of insurrection against the central government.\nAnd maybe maybe you don't believe that the federal government has a right to pass laws restricting immigration.\nIt's not in charge of the integrity of the borders.\nYou know, that that's a kind of philosophical or constitutional case I guess you could make.\nBut most people accept that those are federal duties.\nAnd once you accept that, you can't allow states or municipalities to flout the law any more than you could allow Central High School in Little Rock to keep black students out or whatever.\nI mean, certainly federal troops have been called in for much less.\nAnd I think the longer this continues, the greater the threat of disunion, the greater the threat of reaching a point where you I don't know, you can't drive from New York to LA.\nWe take a lot for granted in the country.\nAnd the main thing we take for granted, I think, is freedom of movement between states.\nBut you could easily imagine that ending like soon in the same way that you can't drive from, and I cuz I've tried from S.\nApollo to to Rio in Brazil, pretty first world country.\nIt's too dangerous to do that.\nYou could easily see that happening here.\nSo, I think once the Trump administration commits to putting down the riots, to enforcing federal law by force, it kind of can't back away from that.\nLike I, you know, and that raises a question, who's funding these, etc., etc.\nAnd I think it's a really interesting question.\nWe should find out.\nI don't think the only arrest should be on the scene.\nI do think the drug cartels are involved flexing their authority in California.\nThey have a lot of control in California as I'm sure you know, etc., etc.\nBut the bottom line question is, does the federal government have a right to enforce federal immigration law?\nYes.\nAnd if states are out of compliance with that, it doesn't have any option but to force the issue.\nTraumatha, when you see this amount of paramilitary, milit literal military coming in, the dragging of, you know, handymen from Home Depot, as opposed to the strategic way this started, which was, hey, we're going to go after the felons, we're going after the gang members, the really bad folks.\nAnd then this time now it seems like, hey, we're just going to roll up to a farm.\nWe're going to roll up to a Home Depot.\nJust grab everybody.\nWe'll figure it out later if their, you know, papers check out or not.\nAre you in favor of the, hey, all 20 million got to go?\nI'll call that the Steve Bannon position.\nOr are you into in the 5% of alien, illegal aliens who are criminals, they need to go, but maybe a path to citizenship for the other 19 million.\nI think the president was asked a version of that question today, Jason.\nAnd I think what he said is there are people that have worked for example on farms for 20 to 25 years or they work in the leisure industry.\nAnd he said we have to take a common sense approach to those people because if you do take those people then it's creating a vacuum where these jobs could get filled by folks that are essentially criminals or other things.\nSo I believe that that's a reasonable starting point.\nWhat I would say is where do we go?\nThere are seven and a half legal, not illegal, legal immigrants in the United States waiting for their adjustment of status.\nThose are doctors, those are lawyers, those are scientists, those are family members of existing American citizens.\nThere's an entire body of people that I think we have to recognize that have been waiting in line and their first act in America was a legal action to come in and contribute.\nAnd every time we start this conversation, we go to the plight of people whose fundamental first action was an illegal action without understanding that there has to be actually a more balanced approach.\nSo yes, I think the president is right.\ncommon sense for the folks that have now been here for a very long time.\nBut we have to prioritize the people that started by saying we're going to wait in line properly and then there's people in the middle.\nBut I think that there needs to be a way to give those folks a chance to get their affairs in order, but they should be playing by the rules.\nGot it.\nAnd I think it's unfair to reward not playing by the rules.\nOkay.\nSo some middle ground between the extreme all 20 million got to go and the one example that I saw online Jason was give folks a stipend and a year.\nYes.\nThe stipen's been out there for a while right to get their affairs in order and then Kaizen said that right Kaizen said that exactly and I think I think Kaizen's clip is actually the most the most rational for the middle chunk.\nBut I would really focus on these legal folks and say what are we doing about those folks whose first action was to raise their hand, stand in line and say I want to contribute by the rules that America sets.\nSo reward them and then punish the illegal folks coming in.\nAdjudicate everybody else or adjudicate everybody else.\nLove it.\nOkay.\nSachs, I'm going to play two clips here to level this up and we can kind of look at this in a multi-deade way.\nHere's Reagan on immigration and then followed by Clinton.\nIt is bold men and women yearning for freedom and opportunity who leave their homelands and come to a new country to start their lives over.\nThey believe in the American dream.\nAnd over and over they make it come true for themselves, for their children, and for others.\nBut their greatest contribution is more than economic because they understand in a special way how glorious it is to be an American.\nThey renew our pride and gratitude in the United States of America, the greatest, freest nation in the world, the last best hope of man on earth.\nAll Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.\nThat's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before.\nWe are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws.\nIt is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.\nOkay, Sachs, my question for you is on a party basis, this seems to have flipped.\nWe talked about this before on the program, Republicans wanted immigration, NAFTA, legal reg uh even maybe an open border where workers could go freely back and forth from Mexico, kind of like the EU.\nAnd uh Clinton wanted to deport folks so that Americans get could have more jobs and that wages would go up.\nNow, it seems to have flipped.\nObviously, you're inside the administration.\nDisclaimer, disclaimer, whatever you however you want to disclaim this.\nWhat's in the best interest of all Americans going forward?\nBecause we have an interesting wrinkle here which I'm sure you've been thinking about as the AI ZAR which is jobs are going away in a lot of key fac.\nSo you have to contend with what the American people want and AI and job destruction or displacement that could be caused by it.\nSo what are your thoughts generally and and I obviously you work in the administration so I want to give you that chance to explain personal versus administration position.\nWell my reaction is that you're doing everything possible to avoid the fact that LA is on fire right now and law enforcement is being assaulted by riers who look like an invading army.\nThey're rioting under a foreign flag.\nYeah.\nYou're showing clips of Reagan and Clinton.\nWhat the hell does this have to do with the fact that there are riots in LA right now?\nOh, I was trying to This is the issue at hand.\nOh, I was trying to level up the conversation to talk about the big picture of immigration, but if we want to get down changing the conversation, I think the No, I I'm I'm\n\n\nTrying to expand. But hold on, hold on, hold on.\n\nIf you're going to accuse me personally of like having a scale here, I'm happy to discuss law enforcement, January 6th, or this one. I believe you should not beat up cops. I come from a family of cops. You know that we've been friends for over 20 years. My family is cop. My family is firefighter. We don't approve of throwing moral tough cocktails at cops. Period. Full stop. I am insulted if you even insinuate that. I didn't insinuate that, but we have not discussed the issue at hand, which is you can feel free to go is burning right now. By the way, if you don't want to get deported, try not rioting under a foreign flag. I mean, it's just a stupid way to advocate for your position if that's what it is. But that's the topic of the week right now. I don't know why you're trying to uplevel this and talk about what Reagan thought 40 years ago. It's just not relevant to what's happening in the news today. Now, you asked what is the quote unquote American position if there is one. I can give you some polling on that. So, first of all, voters approve of the ICE raids in Los Angeles by 55 to 37. That's plus 18. Voters support the administration's effort to deport illegal immigrants by 58 to 37. That's plus 21. They approve of Trump deploying the National Guard by 20 points, 59 to 39.\n\nOnly 36% say the administration's gone too far, while 55% say it's about right or too little. So at plus 19. And even the liberal Quinnipiac poll found that Democrats approved numbers are at a new all-time low of minus 49, whereas Trump is now up to plus six in Morning Consult and plus eight in Rasmusen. So, I think the American people approve of what the administration is doing here. And just to fact check, one thing you said in the introduction, you mentioned this fashion wholesaler that along with Home Depot, you made it sound like these raids were just happening willy-nilly, like there's some big roundup where they were just busting into places and seeing who's illegal, checking people's papers. That's not what happened. This fashion wholesaler is a money laundering operation for the Mexican cartels. This is according to Tom Holman. And many employees there are involved in very serious crimes, drug gang and violence, murder, child rape, and there were warrants for their arrest. So, the way that this whole thing started is ICE was serving criminal warrants that state and local authorities have no right to resist. That's how this started. It wasn't random roundups.\n\nOkay. Okay. I was just there's reporting that Steven Miller specifically said just he was disappointed with the number of people being round up and deported and he said just go to a farm, just go to Home Depot. So I mean that's the reporting. Okay. Well, I have not been able to confirm that reporting. I don't, I personally don't believe it. I think that what Tom Holman said is that they were serving criminal warrants. That's how this started. Okay. Now, I think that part of the reason why the Democrats are so unpopular here is they're basically perceived as excusing the lawlessness by saying that it's only happening because the Trump administration's daring to enforce the law. And so once again, they're siding with looters, arsonists, and violent criminals just like in 2020. And who's siding? This is Democrats. Okay? Because the Democrats, they said no violence. So that was many times Gavin Newsom said no violence. Karen Bass said no violence. They've been tweeting. They also Okay, great. They also are saying that this is all Trump's fault, that Trump started this. Bass and Newsom said that the National Guard wasn't needed because LAPD had everything under control. But LAPD was at first told to stay out of the protests and when the violence erupted and that forced him to step in, they were, according to their own chief of police, Jim McDonald, quickly overwhelmed. So this is McDonald. He said, quote, \"We are overwhelmed. Tonight we had individuals out there shooting commercial grade fireworks at our officers that can kill you. They'll take backpacks filled with cinder blocks and hammers, break the blocks, and pass the piece around to throw officers and cars, even at other people.\" So according to their own chief of police, they needed the help from the National Guard. So that's the real issue here is that Bass and Newsom had this policy of doing nothing and then engaging in denialism, pretending like there wasn't a problem, and then when the problem got too big to ignore, they pretend like it's Trump's fault for causing it. Tucker, what's your thoughts on should the Trump administration have had such a show of force? If the reports are true that they're randomly going, you know, to a Home Depot, if that is true, is that the right approach right now or is it, you know, a little too provocative and they should do this more strategically in your personal opinion?\n\nUh, well, considering that we have American troops in over a 100 bases around the world in countries most Americans can't identify, it's a little weird to be shocked when on that rare occasion they're used to keep the second biggest city in the country from burning down. It seems like a the point of having a military is to keep foreigners from burning your cities. And these are foreigners as David said. They're foreign nationals committing crimes beneath a foreign flag. So that if there was ever a time to use the US military, it's then. And as noted earlier, you can't allow the states to be flagrantly out of compliance with federal immigration law. And I have to say the core question for me as an American is a really a fairness question. So the idea that, you know, people are breaking the law, but it's cool because they're doing essential services, like, well, you know, I pay a lot in taxes. Maybe I pay 80% and that feels like enough to me. And hey, man, do you really have a right to collect the the last 20%? I mean, isn't 80% enough? Like, back off. I don't have the right to say that as an American citizen to an IRS agent, I wind up in jail if I do that or if I break any law, by the way. It's a rule of law, critically important. No, but not only that, it's a double standard. And and I live in a place where a lot of the population subsists on food banks and where there very few jobs and it really is one of those places that NAFTA destroyed whose economy NAFTA destroyed and to see in the place where I live immigrants get preference on housing on jobs which is actually true and I know that liberals watching be like that's not really true. It is true actually and I and I wonder cuz the real number is not 20 million it's closer to 50 million. I think that's true uh illegals in the United States. Clearly, they can't all be deported by ICE. But I also think if you have a system that hands out meaningful grants in effect, cell phones, travel vouchers, housing vouchers, free education, food stamps to people who are here legally or who are here legally as refugees, you are going to draw the world's poor. And I think it's fair to ask, do we want that? How do we benefit from that? And are we giving more to foreigners than we're giving to our own citizens? And the answer is yes. And like how dare you at a certain point, like you get a revolution if you keep doing that. That's too much. It's too offensive. Got it. So I think we all agree no violence on cops, shut the southern border and giving crazy amount. Let me just think the National Guard should never brought in. You let me ask questions, don't you? Do you think the National Guard should be brought in? Yes or no? If the local police can't handle what's going on, of course they should be brought in. Sure.\n\nI believe that during are questioning that decision. You ask me the question. I believe they should have been brought in for January 6th, for BLM, or for the LA riots if the local police can't contain them. 100% I believe the National Guard should have been brought in for January 6th when they were beating cops. I believe they should be brought in now if cops are being beaten. And I believe they should have been brought in during BLM when cops were being beaten. I am pro cop. I come from a family of cops. So you can ask me the questions. So Newsom and Bass are out of line when they say that the National Guard should not have been brought in. I think well number one I think they should call the National Guard if they can't control it. I'm not But that's their criticism of Trump is that he called in the National Guard. You agree that that was necessary. It's obviously necessary. Just look at the TV. The still on fire. The cops are completely overwhelmed.\n\nBy the way, I find it comical that Well, let me stretch this one point then you can speak. Yeah. I find it comical that permission the Massachusetts governor called up the National Guard when DeSantis sent, remember when he sent the 50 migrants over to Martha's Vineyard. Yes. And they all freaked out and they literally called the National Guard in because 50 migrants all of a sudden had been flown into Martha's Vineyard. They did. Yeah. Okay. But was that you can have you can have them or because there was riots? Well, that was when DeSantis was making a point about but that was to process them. They weren't rioting on Martha's Vineyard. These were just nonetheless the National Guard was brought in and you know you can have thousands of people though riding in LA but somehow the National Guard shouldn't be brought in. I we we're in agreement. So you can try to force me to disagree with you but I'm in agreement. Anytime the cops are overwhelmed I think the National Guard should be brought in. Period. Full stop. So we're in agreement on that. What I'm trying to get to is Tucker, if you believe there's 50 million people, let's say the numbers 30 million. We we split the difference between the two, 35 million, whatever it is. My question for you, how many should be deported by ICE at $20,000 a person, which is the estimate that, you know, both sides seem to agree is what it's going to cost. Should we deport a million? Should we deport 10 million? And then how, Tucker Carlson, would you deport them?\n\nWell, I think the goal has to be full compliance with the law for everybody within our borders, citizen or foreign born, illegal, refugee, green card holder. If you're in the United States, you obey our laws. And if you don't, we make a good faith effort to enforce them despite how powerful the political block may be. 50 million. So, so of well, of by definition, or else why wouldn't I apply that same standard to my taxes, right? So, but how do you do it? Citizenship. Yeah. Let's get into that. Yeah. Right. So, well, that's a hostage situation. It's like we've got 50 million here already. We've lied about the number for 30 years now. Wow. It's 50 million or 35 million. We need them. Everyone gets a path to citizenship, you know, that's a kind of crime actually. But the first step, and the phrase has been devalued, but self-deportation, if you have a system where people come to the United States to make their own way and take advantage of the freedoms offered in the economy, uh, they're allowed to participate in the economy, then I think you could have a system where people really admire immigrants in the way that they did when I was growing up and that I I still do in some ways. I mean, some of my favorite people are immigrants and they all tell the same story. Came here with nothing, built this great life, but you make everybody cynical and you sort of destroy the idea of the virtue of immigration when you hand people stuff and give them preference when they arrive. And we don't talk enough about what that actually looks like. We spend a lot more than 20 grand a person right now in subsidies to people who aren't even allowed to be here. They pay into social security too, right? to the tune of 100 million years. Oh, okay. Right. No, no, that's just what was reported by our government. If we want to get conspiracy corner, that's I think those are fake. I think those are fake numbers. Look, does anybody really believe that 50 million illegals is a net benefit to the US economy? Are you serious? Have you been to our cities? No, of course not. It's not. I actually probably a large number of them are a net benefit because they're working in jobs that Americans don't want to take and we're at 4% unemployment. So, who's going to take all those jobs if they get deported? Chucker, aren't But weren't you just saying that we're on the cusp of a of a labor revolution where some you 20% of American jobs are going away in 2 years? It could be. Yeah. So that's the that's the nuance in this discussion is 5 years ago we might be dealing. It's like a brick wall we're about to hit at high speed. And I don't understand having accustomed an entire generation of tens of millions of immigrants to government handouts what the social fabric is going to look like when that stops. Yeah.\n\nCan I say something cuz I I Tucker is saying something really important which I agree with. What should immigration be in a highly developed nation like the United States and my perspective is you have to come and say well what is the goal? I think the goal should be to maintain supremacy. The United States is the most vibrant economy in the world. It's the most important military power in the world. It's the most technically advanced entity in the world. If we do not focus on maintaining our supremacy, I don't think any American wants to go through the process of going from first to not first. And if you look back in history at all of the other countries that have had to go through that transition, that is where revolutions and chaos happen. So we should avoid that. So where does immigration play a role? It needs to play a role first and foremost in technical, military, and economic supremacy. The problem, as Tucker says, is when you have five or six times the number of illegal immigrants as legal immigrants, all of a sudden the idea of using immigration as a cream skimming technique to reinforce the most capable people in the world to come here goes away because you can't have that conversation. We have people languishing for 10, 15, 20 years on visas, okay? Their kids age out. They all go back to India and other places. Why? Because we can't focus on that conversation, Jason, because we're focused on how do we give amnesty to folks whose initial action was breaking\n\n\nthe law. Absolutely correct. And this is where the whole immigration conversation devolves. We are missing the bigger picture, and you need to deal one second. You need to deal with the illegal immigration thing in an extremely foundational way where you can defend the decision. You started illegally, and you have to now go and conform to the law, which is where I'm trying to steer this discussion. Number one, we all agree on closing the border. It seems like there's a breaking consensus here. Tucker wants to eventually deport everybody. You want to do something in the middle like Trump. Sax, I'm not sure what your personal position is or if you want to give it. Do you feel we should try to have a path to deport as many of these 20, 30 million as possible, or do you believe we should have a path towards citizenship for them? What is your personal belief, or do you want to not get... Well, I remember when you asked that question to now Vice President J.D. Vance at allin summit, and he said that you basically address that problem the same way that you eat a sandwich, which is one bite at a time. So that makes sense to me. If there's 20 million illegals, you start with the top million who are violent criminals and gang members, and you deport those. And that is what ICE was doing. They were serving criminal warrants. And then after you successfully do that, then you see where you're at, and you can address the next bite of the sandwich. That makes sense to me. Now, look, I think that we're not really addressing a really core part of the issue here, which is for a couple of decades now, conservatives were demonized, and Tucker in particular, I think you were demonized for warning about the policies that have created the mess that everyone can see on TV right now. And that mess is we have a large unassimilated population of military-aged males who are basically rioting right now under a foreign flag as if they were foreign invaders. We basically have allowed a separatist movement into the United States. That's what it looks like to me. And I remember when Tucker was warning about the policies that might create this on his show for years, you know, virtually alone, probably alone on Fox News, you know, you were called a racist. This was great replacement theory, blah, blah, blah. How can everyone not look at what's happening on TV right now and say Tucker was right? You know, that was really dumb. And look, I say this as someone from a family. I'm one of the people that Ronald Reagan was talking about. You know, my family and I came over here. We're immigrants, but we came over here to assimilate. You know, we believe in the melting pot. Be careful. You might get canceled for bringing up the melting pot. The melting pot's good. I mean, I think that was the classic American model. Melting is totally good. You speak. I'm just saying you could cancel. That's what you're supposed to do. Like why do... why would anybody... I came here because I wanted to be American and everything that American meant. If I was bigger, I would have played football. You know, like there's all these things that I would have done to assimilate more and more. I believe in the culture of the United States. That's why people should come, right? So we came here, we assimilated, you know, high-skill immigrants, didn't have a lot, but had good education and willing to assimilate. That's very different than what you're seeing on TV right now. And again, if the people on TV just wanted to protest immigration policy in the way that you're talking about, I mean, you're describing it in this like very nice, gentle way, they would be peacefully protesting under an American flag, saying, \"We want to be here. We're willing to contribute.\" I think the issue was that's not what's happening. I... you can see that, right? I mean, they look like foreign invaders. I would say, by the way, this is like the dumbest PR that, you know, if this debate is really about immigration, this is like the dumbest way for them to present their side of the argument. Yeah. Because who wants to keep in this country a large unassimilated population that is proud to march, not just march, but actually protest and riot and burn and assault under the flag of another nation? I would say dollars to donation. Majority of the people who are doing the looting and rioting are not actually immigrants because they have the ability to be deported. The people who are doing that are the bad actors that we saw during BLN. The bad actors that we saw, you know, in LA when the Lakers win. I've lived here for a decade, and I am here right now. I can tell you it's contained. And those 80, 90% of those people are not the immigrants. The immigrants are hiding right now for fear of being deported. But let's sort of talk about the path. Well, where do you... where do you guys want to go with it here? I mean, uh, I can give you my opinion if you want. Well, Tucker, I mean, like I... I don't know. I mean, I don't want to speak for you, but I mean, I... I... I do think that like Tucker should feel vindicated on this issue for speaking about so many years. You feel vindicated?\nI mean, I never doubted it. I grew up... I was born in California in 1969, and I... my family got there in 1850. I have some sense of what the state was like, um, certainly through my childhood, and it was an... it was idyllic, and it's... it's... it's not, you know, the rich areas are great, is great, is still great, I think. I mean, there are great Mount Shasta is great, lots of great places in California, um, but fundamentally, the state is a slum, Latin American country, and immigration did that, and I say that as someone who is pretty pro-immigrant actually. My best friend's an immigrant. I mean, I... I've always admired, liked immigrants, um, I'm hardly anti-immigrant or anti-immigration, but the way we did it destroyed the state. Immigration is what made California into a slum, and there's kind of no way around that. And so, that's not an argument against all immigration. I... I'm not making that argument. I don't feel that way. But, uh, it's an argument against what we did in California. And rather than learn from that, we're doing it in every other state. And I don't know why. And I think, you know, if the other side had a reasonable argument, they would profer it. But instead, they call you names and try to turn you into some kind of thought criminal or whatever. I don't care, obviously. Um, but it's a... it's a sort of measure of how, um, little they have to say in response. They're not actually trying to make the country better. That's kind of the main thing. I have always thought immigrants are great because they did it make the country better, right? I mean, I... I think that's demonstrable. But the people pushing our current policies don't have that as a goal. This is a kind of punishment for something. And a lot of it's ethnic, actually. It's a... it's a kind of attack on the people who were born here. I don't know where that hostility comes from. You can feel it though. And I think it's foolish to deny it. That is a motive. They're trying to hurt the people who live here. And I again, I live in a place currently where I see that happening. Um, and it drives me totally bonkers. And the last thing I'll say is if you think the way we once did immigration was good, and a lot of immigrants are awesome people, and I do think that this is discrediting all immigration 100%, and it's turning people into pretty radical immigration restrictionists are like, look, I don't want any more immigrants. Yeah, you know, that's inevitable. Um, but it's sad to see it.\nBy the way, what you're saying is is the most true for immigrants. Legal immigrants look at illegal immigration even more negatively than native-born Americans, which makes sense, right? I mean, they waited in line and other people didn't. You would be really upset if somebody cut the line. Jason, what do you think? Obviously, there's a lot of emotion around this issue. I think numbers help, and I always look to see what is the consensus amongst the group here and amongst, you know, Americans. Everybody wants the border closed. Trump won on that. So, okay, we all agree the border should be closed. I think 80, 90% consensus in that 80, 90% of Americans think we should deport violent criminals. Okay, we got consensus there. So then what's left is what do we do with high-skilled recruiting? I like to use the word recruiting, and we had that discussion with President Trump here. He promised to put a green card on every degree. I agree with him on that. I think we should be recruiting at least a million or two million amazing people per year. One to two million amazing people. We should match that to what the needs of the country are. If we need energy, if we need doctors, we should match that. Where we probably disagree is I think the Democrats and the Republicans share equally in this issue that was created that Tucker pointed out. Yes, there are 40, 30, 50, who knows what the exact number is. That's part of the problem. Here's a chart we made. This just shows you under each of the last, you know, uh, 50, almost 50 years of presidents, how many people net uh, immigrated to the country. And as you can see, you know, it's been pretty consistent.\nYou know, around 3 million per, and uh, Clinton and Bush had a ton of immigration. Both uh, Bushes were paid for a lot of their donations came from corporates who wanted free migration. America created this. Hold on. Let me finish my thought. Outlier here, Jason, though. Oh, well, yeah. Biden is the huge outlier. We... We all agree on that. Biden let it go yolo. And I understand people have a lot of resentment for that, and rightfully so. And if you bring in 10 million people, you're going to let get a lot of bad guys. But you put this all together. My belief is that this is a country of immigrants and that this country does great when hardworking immigrants assimilate. I think we should take this raw firepower of these incredible immigrants who have been here for decades. If you've been here for 10 or 20 decades, pay a fine, pay some extra taxes, and we give these people a path to citizenship. And we recruit the top one to two million people. That's my belief. You do that before or after the people that have been waiting in line get a fair shake. I think I would start before or after. I think you have to do it before because we created this. And I... I know that that's not something that people want to take ownership of, but America created the situation. Bush created it. created Clinton America. Yes. The country that we live in, our government allowed millions of people here, and the Republicans did this specifically in order to get cheap labor. Let me... let me ask for what we did with these people. Let's just say that you're an international... Let's just say you're an international mathematics olympiad winner. You get recruited to come to the United States on a student visa. You crush it. Let's say you go to MIT and then you go and do a PhD at Caltech, and then you get recruited on an OPT visa by Google, and you're just crushing. Awesome. And... and you're saying that that person... Oh, no. Sorry. That's a more subtle question. That person we should recruit. As I said very clearly, recruit 1 to 2 million. They're currently waiting in line, Jason. Yes. So, let's just... So, I'm saying yes, let them in. And yes, a path to... who do you prioritize? You have one. You can do both at the same time. No, no, you don't. Can... of course you can. We could have one group recruiting a million to 2 million highly skilled labor, highly skilled individuals of the type you're describing, while having another group. We can do two things at the same time. Chimoth, absolutely you can. You're... you're giving a false question here. Then we take the person who's been here for 20 years as a dishwasher, as a nanny, who has been an amazing citizen, who has been paying into social security. Give them a path, a compassionate path. And we as America and Americans should take ownership of the fact that we allowed this, and the people who allowed it were Republicans and Democrats. We allowed these people to come in to work in our restaurants and fields, which is what Trump said today. Trump is in agreement with me. That's not what he said. He said something. He said he wants to not have those people leave. It's just amazing to me that on this podcast during the Biden years, you were echoing this party line that the videos of, you know, mass migration, caravans streaming across the border, going through the holes in the wall. You said those were videos cherrypicked by Fox News. You told the party line that there was no problem. Now all of a sudden, now all of a sudden you're saying it was a bipartisan problem. No, no, fact check. I said we are... we don't know because we don't have the the metrics, and we don't have a good system, which we all agree on. There's no good system. Anybody who went down to the border was saying that it was wide open, right? And as we got that data, I said this data on the ground shows we should shut the border. That's always suddenly became very empirical about the issue. I... I've always been empirical about it, and I've also been compassionate. This whole like both sides are to blame thing kind of ignores the fact that you had the Trump revolution in 2016. There is some truth to the idea that both parties neglected the problem. If you go back far enough, like, you know, Tucker will remember this when Bob Bartley was the editor of the Wall Street Journal op-ed page, they actually supported a constitutional amendment in favor of open borders. I mean, they really believed in this whole idea of pull free trade, open borders, free flow of capital and labor. Okay, but that was a long time ago. And you know, with the rise of Trump in 2015, 2016, it became a different party. Trump got elected on building a wall. Yeah. And what happened? The Democrats fought him tooth and nail. They tied him up in litigation. He was able to build hundreds of miles of wall, but there were uncompleted parts of it. And when Biden came into office, there were large pieces of the wall that were still on the ground just waiting to be erected. And Biden sold them off as scrap metal for two cents on the dollar. Do you remember this? And then Biden and the Democrats proceed in favor. Hold on a second.\nPlease don't frame it as I'm against that. Okay, just forget about you. Just you... you said Democrats and Republicans\n\n\nAre they blamed for this?\nNot in the last, not in the last eight years.\nNo.\nOh, yeah.\nNo.\nNo.\nBiden, Trump wanted a wall.\nYeah.\nBiden.\nYeah.\nOpened up the border, and Democrats supported him in that, and they thwarted every Republican attempt to close the border for three years.\nHold on a second.\nFor three years, they gaslit and pretended it wasn't a problem.\nThen, when it became undeniable, they claimed that Biden didn't have the executive authority, so they would need a new act of Congress.\nThat was also total nonsense.\nAs Trump said in the State of the Union, you didn't need a new law; you just need a new president.\nLook, if you want to go back 20 or 30 years, you can blame both parties.\nIf you want to talk about the last 8 years, there's only one party to blame: one party, the Democrats.\nAnd that is why you look at the polling right now.\nDemocrats, their party all-time low.\nIt is, let's get the exact number, -49.\n21% approve of Democrats, 70% disapprove because they know that Democrats cause this problem, and Democrats are the ones denying.\nThey're the ones basically making excuses for the disorder and the chaos right now.\nThe only Democrat, the only Democrat who's actually talking sense right now, is the one with a head injury, ironically, Fetterman.\nHe's a lone voice here.\nI want to pull up this quote.\nDon't make...\nDude, that's...\nNo, I mean, it's amazing.\nNo, I mean, it's, it's kind of sad.\nBut look, I'm agreeing with Fetterman.\nFetterman says, caveat that he hit his head.\nI don't know what it is about Democrats.\nI don't know what it is about Democrats.\nIt takes a head, it takes a head injury for them to talk sense.\nOkay.\nIt's like a Bullworth thing.\nAnyway, Fetterman said, \"My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement.\"\nHe's talking about January 6th.\nI unapologetically stand for free speech, peaceful demonstrations, immigration, but this is not that.\nThis is anarchy and true chaos.\nSo, kudos to Fetterman, but he's the only Democrat out there.\nHe's a lone voice condemning the violence.\nAnd Tucker's our guest.\nWe're going to give Tucker the last word on this topic before we go on to the next one.\nAnd you are 100% correct.\nBiden, 10 million net immigrants, and Trump, 3 million, which sounds like a lot, but is actually the lowest in like 10 administrations, the lowest since Reagan.\nTucker, you're our guest.\nWrap us up here.\nWhat should we think?\nI think that we should measure the health of a country, at least in part, by the condition of its cities, including the cleanliness of its cities.\nAnd by that measure, our country is collapsing.\nOur, our cities are a disaster, and the, the richest part of the richest cities are fine, and the rest of them are just absolutely awful.\nAnd so I think that has got to be just job one.\nIf you want to renew the United States, you have to make sure its population centers are clean, safe, orderly, but especially clean.\nThere's something really important, and I know that the left just instinctively discounts that, but cleanliness is next to godliness.\nAnd your city is a reflection of your self-respect, how you feel about your nation, your patriotism.\nAnd if you allow it to become like Paris or New York, covered in graffiti and filth and random people from other countries selling fruit on the street and begging and having sex in ATM vestibules and just like the whole Midtown Manhattan, Central Paris experience, like that's a sign your civilization is going under.\nI think it's really, really important, and I do think, you know, that decay is not entirely caused by mass immigration, but mass immigration has made it much worse, and I just know that from walking around, cuz I like to walk around cities.\nI think it's a national emergency, and the riots are just the most fluid expression of that.\nYou know, a burning car is something you can't ignore, but we do ignore the condition of 6th Avenue at 49th Street, like how can a self, or the condition of Penn Station, or, you know, of our airports, like how can we allow that?\nUm, so if I were in charge, I mean, I would make you go to Dubai or Doha or Moscow or some place that has a sense of itself.\nWhen we got soba in Tokyo, remember two years ago, and we were talking about this exact issue, it just, well, but it's true.\nI mean, Tokyo is the most radicalizing experience for an American.\nEveryone who goes there is like, I can't even deal with this.\nI'm so angry that we've put up with what we're putting up with.\nI had to talk it in.\nYou did.\nLet's not overthink it, I guess, is what I'm saying.\nIt's not even about the Constitution.\nIt's about litter.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nTucker gets the last word on that.\nAnd now David Sacks gets to take his incredible victory lap.\nEconomic data has been objectively pretty great the last two weeks.\nTariff revenue spiked $23 billion in May, 2x from February.\nSo there we go.\nWe see the impact of a little bit of extra income.\nInflation continues to come down, and uh, what are we at?\n2.4%.\nAcross the board, there's some pluses and minuses in there.\nWe'll get into it later.\nGDP.\nOkay, this is the leading GDP prediction model from the Atlanta Fed.\nCould be as high as 3.8%.\nAgain, this is a prediction for Q2.\nQ2 is obviously not over, but this would be a pretty big jump over Q1.\nDespite all this positive data, the deficit remains the sticky issue.\nSome of our friends might have some issue with this and been vocal about it.\nIn May, the US had $371 billion in revenue with $687 billion in spend.\nNot good.\nBig high burn rate, $316 billion deficit.\nWe paid $90 billion in May in interest on the debt, almost up to a hundred billion a month.\nAnd uh, there's a nice key chart, uh, which we all like.\nWe could double click on that if anybody finds something interesting in here.\nHere's your deficit tracker.\nWhat I'll highlight here for you is those first two lines, 2020 and 2021.\nYou got to kind of give a mulligan there for the COVID years, and uh, purple, 2025.\nWe are a bit ahead of the last couple of years.\nWe're 13, our spending now, and you know, obviously the debt service is a big part of this.\n13% above 2024, 20% above 2023, and 65% above 2022.\nThe balance sheet of the United States is really bad right now.\nSacks, I'm going to start with you.\nThis obviously has been an emotional issue, and uh, oh, apology.\nI just noticed, forgot to hit publish on last week's episode, but let's let that go.\nUh, it won't happen again.\nSacks, what are your thoughts here?\nWell, I mean, you'll recall that back in early April, Jim Kramer predicted we'd see a Black Monday in response to Trump's tariffs.\nAnd that's all the proof that we should have known that we were about to get a bunch of good economic news.\nUh, and it wasn't, it wasn't just Jim Kramer.\nI mean, Larry Summers was on our pod with that big debate that we did, and he was predicting doom.\nAnd what we're seeing now is good economic news is breaking out all over.\nSo Q2 GDP on track for 3.8% according to the Atlanta Fed.\nThe May jobs report was above expected, plus 139,000.\nCPI, you know, inflation down to 2.4%.\nSo growth is back.\nInflation is low.\nAnd what you saw over the last few months was the elites in both parties, I'll give you that, have, they were scaremongering on tariffs and predicting doom, and they've been proven to be out of touch with popular sentiment and reality.\nI mean, you don't want to spike the football too soon, but things look really good right now.\nYeah.\nAnd I mean, in fairness, when the Trump shock and awe with the tariffs, he came out pretty strongly, Zach, you will admit, and the market did tank massively for about 30 days.\nTucker, what's your take on the economy today?\nThis debt, does it concern you?\nAnd I'm wondering what, because there seems to be a little bit of a rift inside of the Republican party on the BBB, not Bill Back Better, but the Big, Beautiful Bill.\nWhat's Tucker Carlson's take?\nI'm curious, on out of control spending, the deficit, and this bill in relation to that.\nWell, I mean, I have the world's most predictable views.\nI believe in physics.\nSo, you know, an unpayable debt tanks your country at a certain point.\nThat was pre-existing.\nIt's accelerated as you noted.\nI, I don't know a single person who's got a any kind of plan to fix it.\nI think we're just going to ride it into whatever the point of oblivion is.\nBut I would just say on tariffs, you know, my, you've got the reverse Kramer.\nDavid was saying that's his measure of economic forecasting.\nFor me, it's the Wall Street Journal editorial page.\nWhatever they're for is poison, um, generally speaking, and anything that drives them insane is a virtue.\nAnd I just can't imagine a policy more perfectly designed to just make them like explode than uh, Trump's tariff announcement.\nAnd I, and I have to say, I mean, I've been kind of pretty conventional Republican my entire life.\nI remember when I decided the Iraq war was a bad idea.\nThat felt like an outlaw, you know, idea.\nWhat, what led you to...\nUh, well, I went to Iraq, um, in December of 2003 to see where a friend of mine had been killed, and um, so I was there right after the invasion, and I just immediately recognized this is not, we're, we're not a good colonial power because we won't admit that we are.\nWe won't admit that we have an empire, therefore we can't administer it in a rational way.\nUm, just the obvious stuff.\nBut anyway, the point is the last remaining kind of unexamined orthodoxy in my head was free trade.\nAnd I happened to be just by chance at the White House the day of that announcement.\nAnd I remember thinking, man, if this works, what a caper, you know?\nI mean, I don't know.\nWorst case scenario in your mind of, you know, this tariff negotiation.\nObviously, there have been multiple rounds of it.\nI'm not gonna use the term taco, but it does seem like we've shifted from shock and awe to maybe like kind of bore.\nIt's kind of boring, like, and, and that does seem to be Trump's approach, right?\nHe in negotiations, big bang and then fall back to a reasonable position.\nSo, I think we're in the reasonable position phase.\nWhat does success willing?\nI, I hope, I pray that's what we're seeing on Iran right now.\nUm, but you're absolutely right.\nI mean, that's sort of the nature of negotiations, of course.\nUm, and there is nothing in writing with China, so far as I know, and it'll be reassuring, I think, when there is.\nUm, but in general, we haven't seen what Jim Kramer and Larry Summers predicted, and that itself is amazing.\nIt's amazing, and it, it causes you, someone like me is sort of on the sidelines of the economic debate, but watching carefully, it does make you sort of wonder, like, what other absurd midcentury orthodoxies about economics have I internalized that just aren't true, right?\nCuz that was the biggest of all.\nTariffs are, you know, they caused the Great Depression.\nWe know that.\nAnd, and so what if like you can have a kind of mixed approach with some trade barriers that are tailored to your benefit and that sort of works in a longitudinal way?\nIf that's true, holy smokes.\nAnd it looks like it might be true.\nSo it's been true for the other side, right?\nThey have been doing that.\nSo if it's for China and South Korea and Australia, why wouldn't it be true for us?\nIt seems like we're the sucker at the poker table.\nWell, I think you're right.\nI guess what I'm, all I'm saying, I'm making a pretty pedestrian point, but I can't get past it, which is this is so far from what the Republican party stood for 10 years ago, which was neoconservative foreign policy, free trade, um, open borders, as, as you noted, maybe a little more than 10 years ago, but 15 years ago.\nUm, this is, this is the mirror image of it, and it just blows my mind.\nAnd it's, it's such a better version.\nIt's such a more reality-based, flexible, thoughtful, uh, version than we had before.\nAnd I'm just really, and most Republicans in the Senate are not even aware this is happening.\nThey are the most recalcitrant people in the world.\nAlso the dumbest.\nSo most of them, you know, don't accept any of this.\nBut just as an observer, I'm thrilled to see it.\nAll right, Chimath.\nUh, actually, can I get, can I, um...\nOh, yeah, sure.\nNo, no, no.\nI mean, I know you like to go right after Tucker.\nIt's very engaging.\nOh, no.\nYou got me thinking about these.\nUm, this is his dream.\nWhen you're on, he cannot in the group chat.\nHe's so excited.\nTucker, when you're coming on, it's 48 hours of Sax being like, \"When does, when is the pod coming?\nIs Tucker really coming?\"\nThat's how I feel about David Sacks.\nTrust me, if you, if you had a camera at my dinner table, you would hear something similar.\nOh, boy.\nHere we go.\nGo ahead, Sax.\nIt's uh, it's great to have someone to the right of me on the podcast for once.\nYou know, it's not an easy task.\nI, we invited Alex Jones and Steve Aman to have him respond.\nTucker got me thinking about these unexamined orthodoxies, and that is a good way of putting it.\nI mean, you know, cuz I studied economics in college, and you know, I learned that the Smoot-Hawley tariff caused the Great Depression.\nAnd it's like in hindsight, you're like, how can that even be true?\nLike a tariff is basically a tax rate on foreign goods.\nAnd you're saying that, you know, increasing taxes on foreign goods all of a sudden cause a great depression.\nIt doesn't make any sense when you actually like just think about it.\nNow, what caused Great Depression?\nWell, I would say when thousands of banks went under and there's no FDIC, and everyone just got wiped out by that, and it's a systemic risk.\nSo, like one bank failure leads to the next one.\nThat's so obviously what caused the Great Depression is nobody had any money left.\nThey all got wiped out when all the banks went under at the same time.\nRight.\nWell, and then what, how do we take a something that happened in the 20s and 30s and apply it to a much more dynamic world like today?\nIt doesn't make much sense.\n\n\nWell, I think what happened is we had all these post-war, meaning post-World War II, understandings that kind of got hardwired into the consciousness of our intellectuals. And if you think about the era right after World War II, the US was like the last great power standing. Um, it was us and the Soviet Union, but they kind of had a different system. They were not part of the, um, let's say, the free world. They're part of this communist block. So, with in terms of the, the quote unquote free world, we were the only country that was relatively undamaged, and we had this giant manufacturing base. And so, yeah, obviously that the fewer trade barriers existed across the world, the better it was for the United States because it was our goods and our factories that basically were able to sell all over the world. And so we proceeded to define a world order in which we just kicked down every single barrier to free trade because that's what benefited us. Now, I don't know that that means that that situation always benefits us in all times and all places. I mean, the big issue we have right now is that you've got a rising China, and they have become the scale producer in the world for all sorts of goods. They now have this giant industrial base that we seem to have exported to them. And again, it was, and we exported a lot of that because of this, um, free trade ideology that got so entrenched in our thinking that we just stopped thinking about under what circumstances this might not continue to be good for us. And so we've ended up becoming dependent on them for all sorts of goods that we now realize are highly strategic. And we're trying to figure out, well, how do we onshore these things because it seems really dangerous now for us to be singlethreaded on, you know, on potentially adversarial power for rare earth or, you know, rare earth magnets and chips and pharmaceuticals and all these things. But, you know, our intellectual class just never seems to revisit any of its assumptions. They just kind of have these dogmas. Chamath, building on Sacks's sort of cottification of truths, heuristics, and not getting questioned. How much of it is we just codify, hey, trade good, you know, open borders good, free trade good, and how much of it is just incentives, like, I mean, rich people paying off politicians to have more free trade independent of party seems to be what's happened over the last 10, 20 years. It just made more sense to put workers and to send jobs to the lowest cost place to increase profits for American companies, which, let's face it, although it may have hollowed out our manufacturing and created this weakness in the four or five areas you point out every week that we need to reinforce quite eloquently, the real issue is we did that because we wanted to make money. We wanted to have the most highly profitable companies, and we did succeed. But maybe we succeeded too much, and our companies benefited more than the middle class. You got Josh Holly out there saying, \"Hey, we should go to $15 minimum wage federally from this.\" The wrong, the wrong people won in the early in the early 2000s. I think that there was a war of ideas, and there was a group of people that advocated for this reckless form of free trade and this globalist view, like every country is going to meld into one mega monolith country organization that'll get governed out of New York by the United Nations and its sleeve organizations. And that worldview won. But it was the wrong worldview.\nAnd it didn't acknowledge that we have competing philosophies, competing priorities, competing ideals of what the future looks like. And I think that we need to go back and reset all of those things. If you just take where we are, if you can just put the Sanki diagram back up, there's a couple things that are really worth noting that people need to fundamentally understand. I said a couple weeks ago that I thought the GDP print was going to come in hot. I think everybody now is sort of where I am. So, let me give you the next thing. Let me just ask you though, why is it hot? Do you have a thesis on why GDP spikes so much or potentially did that's obviously a forecast.\nI don't know the puts and takes yet. And I think when we see the print, we have, I have a way of forecasting this stuff, which is a bunch of signals that my team and also many macro teams all around the world, the bond vigilantes to the hedge fund guys, they all feed it to me. And what I was noticing was that we were going to come in, I said in the low 3s. And I think, you know, if Atlanta Fed is right, I don't think they are, but I think it's going to be in the low to mid-3s. is going to be meaningfully greater than what people are expecting. So let me just give you my next prediction. My next prediction are two really important things. What this Sanki diagram looks at, which is a snapshot of the balance sheet and the health of the United States in May, misses in my opinion two very important things that have to change.\nThe first, and this is a positive for the Trump administration and the United States economy, is we are run rating 300 to 400 billion dollar above forecast in terms of our receipts, meaning the revenues that we will take in, and you get to that number by looking at the last three months of tariffs and forecasting forward assuming a reasonable balance here. So, back to Tucker's point. Yeah, we all thought that this was like a boogeyman that you weren't allowed to touch it, and that if you touched the stove, you were going to get burned.\nThe mathematical reality is that this is actually going to work out much better for us than we anticipated, and it's going to be somewhere in the range of 300 to 400 billion of extra revenue per year. That's a huge win.\nSo, why is that important?\nThat then sets up this next cataclysmic thing that we're going to see over the next 60 days, which is what does Jerome Powell do?\nIf Jerome Powell stays politicized, his incentive will be to keep interest rates where they are.\nIf Jerome Powell looks at the conditions on the ground, especially when you start to see inflation stay in the low twos and approach 2.0, the real thing that he's going to be under tremendous pressure to justify is why are you not cutting?\nAnd just to give you a sense of how important that is, if we cut by 100 basis points, that's another $300 billion. Now, in that case, that's not money that we get in, but it's money we don't have to spend.\nSo if you add these two things together, we are in the next 60 days going to have to reforecast the American balance sheet where this is, or we're actually going to be able to positively forecast an extra 600 billion. 300 billion of incremental revenue and 300 billion of savings.\nJason, if that happens, watch out. What does that mean? Watch out. It means that every single risk dollar is going to run to America. Every single one. Yum. Yum. Forget Japan. Forget Europe. There is no place to put your money except the United States. So, I think that we have to figure out how to get Jerome Powell on the side of America versus on the side of what could happen politically. Because I think that there's probably a version in his head that says, \"My gosh, if I do this, it helps Trump, and if I don't do it, it hurts Trump.\" Practically that is true. But the reality is the conditions on the ground justify cutting. Okay. So you're predicting this 300 billion two different ways in and out, 50 billion a month. It starts cutting this deficit pretty significantly. Your claim, I just want to be clear here, is that Powell is playing politics, not working towards the dual mandate, which is very clear, controlled unemployment at the 2.0 rate and full employment. Your belief is that he's playing politics. Yes. I, I believe that these decisions are political. I think that the Federal Reserve has veered away from actually controlling the money supply in the best long-term interests of the United States and more towards what benefits the short-term. And this ties back to how I started this. What is Powell's motivation? Somewhere in the 2000s, Jason, we transitioned away from having the strategic 20-year conversation about what's in the best interest of America. And instead, we started to have these uniolar globalist conversations. And the people that got into these centers of power, the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, the central banks around the world, they all worked towards an agenda that is now being undone. I'll give you an example of where this is now being undone. Just today, the World Bank undid a rule around being able to fund nuclear energy. And you would have thought, well, hold on a second. The World Bank steps in to backstop all these developing countries when they're in the middle of all this nonsense, right? And if you think about a country that's developing, what is the single biggest input to that country? Energy. And you think for the last 40 years of multi-trillion dollar bailouts, we never demanded abundant clean energy in the developing world. Of course not, because it was a political decision.\nOkay, Tucker, do you believe the Fed is playing politics here? It's kind of hard to believe if Powell was placed by Trump and Biden. He's there was consensus there, and his mandate is to get to 2.0 and full employment. He's kind of trending towards that. He's made a couple of cuts. The markets predict he is going to make a cut. Here's Polymarket for September showing 80% chance of a cut. Let's take a look if that's changed since the last time. Uh, so in September, no. Okay. Well, this has changed. Uh, 32. All right. So here's your Polymarket Fed decision in September. No change. 53% 25 bips, 43 50 bips, 3.8. So you put those two together, you're you're roughly at 47% chance of a cut, 53% chance of no cut. So 50/50 coin toss. Do you think the Fed is playing politics? Do I think the Fed chairman who who lives in who lives in Chevy Chase is a political actor? I mean, are you serious? What's his motivation then? What's his endgame? Why does he not want to cut rates or or why would he not want to put it? Well, of course. I mean, he lives in a world in which there is no one who doesn't want to stick it to Trump. I mean, I know the zip code that he lives in very, very well. Um, I know the club that he goes to. I know the world. No, no, I would. Of course not. And I'm not mad at him. I'm just saying I, I, I know the world well. And um, of course no, uh, no one in that world wants to be seen uh, helping Trump, and Trump has attacked him by the way in public. So I don't think that helps either. I think the structure of the Fed governance is very weird. I think um, I, I'm not exactly sure what the Fed is. I've asked this question to a lot of economists, including Larry Summers. Never really gotten a straight answer. Like how is it that um, this is beyond political control? I mean, I don't know if we're for democracy, shouldn't voters have some say in how this is administered? But they don't. I mean, there's no direct mechanism for voters to be heard um, in this, the single most important institution in the American economy. How does that, which is a crypto government organization? It's, you know, administering US dollars. I don't, I just don't understand it. I think it's very, the idea that you're going to depoliticize it by making its leadership immune from the control of elected officials strikes me as the kind of like midcentury dumbness that got us NATO and a lot of other bad institutions. I just don't get it. The exact opposation of the Fed be here, I've asked this two times. Can't seem to get an answer. What, what's the motivation of the Fed? Just is it to stick it to Trump? Jason, Jason, let me, well, let me give you another data point. Okay, now let's assume, let's just scenario play. Yes, please. What happens if Powell rips in a 100 basis point cut right now? I'll tell you. So one part, which is mathematical, is the interest on the debt goes down. We save 300 billion. But there's something else that happens, which is the Fed does control the front end of the curve. Meaning, how do people borrow money for small amounts of time from one day to about two years? If you make that cheaper, we know is it's a test as true as time, what happens is people borrow more money. That fuels more growth. That will end up in GDP. So, what actually happens if you cut rates 100 basis points is not just the 300, but you can get this reflexive positivity in the economy. What that allows you to do is even if that causes a little bit more inflation, you're actually growing yourself out of this whole thing. So then you ask yourself, well, hold on a second. If the numerical justification is there to lower rates and it has all of these other positive externalities for the United States economy, why don't I do it? The only answer is political.\nI, I wonder if, hold on. Let me just, let me, let me teach you. Um, okay. So, we're at 2.6% on uh, inflation. He wants to get it down to two. Feels like we're in striking distance. Maybe you could maybe give us a theory here, Sacks, of what would the political motivation be? I find it hard to believe that he's trying to sink Trump for some reason as opposed to maybe just being scared of inflation popping up above that 3x handle, which then triggers them to, you know, raise rates. So, what's what's your theory here? If you're pal, it's better to take the risk of being Paul Volcker than Arthur Burns. I mean, that's that's basically what it comes down to. For people who don't Well, because what happened is Arthur Burns let inflation slip the leash in the 1970s, and he's remembered as a horrible Fed chair. And then Paul Volcker came in and jacked up rates to like, I think, close to 20%. And caused a vicious recession in 1982. But by 1983, the economy had bounced back, and inflation basically was under control. And then the rate cutting cycle started. And that rate cutting cycle went for like 25 years. And then Reagan got reelected in 1984. So you, you know, you rather be a Volcker than than a Burns if you're a Fed chair. Now you raised the question, is pal political? Yeah, of course he is. If you go back to uh, was it 2021? So, the first summer of Biden's presidency, we got that shock 5.1% inflation print of in May of 2021, if my memory is correct. What did the Biden administration do? They sent Janet Yellen out to say it was transitory, and Pal got on\n\n\nI was on board with the whole transitory narrative.\nExactly.\nAnd as a result of that, he did not raise rates for six months.\nAnd worse than that, they continued QE.\nI think they bought like 180 billion of bonds in that time period, and that's what allowed inflation to get so out of control.\nNow, why is it that Powell did that?\nBecause he wanted to get reconfirmed, and yes, he was nominated by Trump originally, but Biden renominated him, and he basically wanted the reappointment by Biden, and he wanted to get confirmed.\nThen, the month after he got confirmed, all of a sudden, he shifted gears and started raising rates again once he was safely in Wisconsin's office.\nSo, he did the right thing in terms of raising rates in the face of inflation once he was free from those political incentives, but for six months, he was intensely political, and that cost the United States dearly, I think, dearly, dearly.\nSo now, if you're a Powell, you've got PTSD from that whole experience, and you're going to err on the side of not letting inflation come back.\nI think what with inflation down to 2.4%.\nI think it is time to cut rates, but he's fearful because again, his incentives are to be a Vulker, not a Burns.\nYeah.\nAnd uh, you want to read a good book?\nPaul Vulker is keeping at it.\nGreat uh book about has uh Reagan going to him and trying to get him to cut rates.\nSo, this is a reoccurring story, just on, but you know, if if he had done the right thing in the summer of 2021, we would never would have had that bubble at the end of 2021.\nYeah.\nRemember, and that that basically created a huge crash in 2022, and we could have avoided a good part of that if he had done the right thing.\nYou know, like the Fed chair, it's not a hard job most of the time.\nI mean, these guys sit in their ivory tower, and then once a quarter, they come out and do this, you know, and basically testify and say a bunch of, you know, things that no one can understand, but like once in a while, you got to get the decision right.\nAnd he totally screwed it up in that one time where he had to get it right.\nYep.\nAnd I would say this could be one of those moments too where I think he's being a little bit fearful.\nI think that there's a simpler explanation, quite honestly.\nLike if you look at Powell's history, he was he was nominated as a governor by Obama.\nThen Trump picked him out of the Fed to be chair, but then he was reappointed by Biden.\nIf you look at the vice chair of the Fed, Phil Jefferson, he was appointed by Biden.\nIf you look at Michelle Bowman, who's the vice chair for supervision, she was appointed by Trump.\nMichael Bar appointed by Biden.\nLisa Cook appointed by Biden.\nAdriana Kugler appointed by Biden.\nChris Waller appointed by Trump.\nSo I think the point is that there is a balance of power here.\nIf you look at political affiliations that tend to favor a democratic view of the political landscape, and let's be honest, what benefits the Democrats more, a thriving economy and a shrinking deficit going into the midterms or the exact opposite?\nThe reason I'm bringing this up, and I'm just harping on it, is he's a Republican who Democrats have opposed.\nSo I'm I'm just trying to reconcile this grand conspiracy that he wants to sing Trump.\nI don't think it's Republican.\nI think it's just a general decision.\nI think these guys move the dot plots, and you can see it in the movement.\nOkay.\nThey're going away from reading the actual data and moving in concert with the data to giving themselves a window to let the data play itself out beyond a reasonable point.\nAnd my point is the beyond the reasonable point is the key part because when you talk to the large sophisticated pools of money.\nYeah.\nMany of them are like, what is going on here?\nAll right.\nCurrently, the Big, Beautiful Bill is uh in the Senate, passed the house by a one-vote margin.\nTrump said he wants the Senate to pass the bill by Independence Day, July 4th.\nUh, Senate math.\nRepublicans have a 53 to 47 majority.\nAs you know, they can afford three nos on their side since Dems are united against the bill.\nWith 50 votes, JD Vance can break the tie, obviously.\nSo, it's easier if they can get to 51.\nSeven GOP senators are either no or maybe no.\nThree likely nos, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson, Rick Scott.\nFour maybe nos over the Medicaid cuts.\nUh, Josh Holly, Susan Collins, Marowski, Jim Justice.\nUh, none of those senators have committed either way.\nAnd Republicans are now falling into three camps on BBB.\nHard yes, soft yes, no until it's fixed.\nObviously, uh, some friends of ours were a little upset about the BBB, and uh, we had a pretty chaotic week the last week.\nIt looks like the reconciliation is in.\nYour take on the last week and the reactions to the BBB and obviously Elon and Trump's relationship.\nTucker Carlson, I hate the whole thing.\nThis is not how to legislate.\nI You shouldn't have a bill this big.\nIt's impossible to get your mind around it.\nNo one can read it.\nNo one understands it.\nIt favors professional staff over legislators.\nIt totally leaves the public out.\nIt'll be a decade before anyone understands what it means.\nUm, the lobbies love it.\nIt's just it's Washington at its ugliest.\nUm, not this specific bill, though.\nIt is an example of it, but just this is just not the way to do it.\nAnd it's not the way it has been done throughout American history.\nI mean, there's just no reason to aggregate it all together like this.\nIt becomes totally unmanageable and totally undemocratic.\nSo, you know, I mean, yeah.\nWell, it's insane.\nIt's totally insane.\nDo can I mean, can can you tell me what's in it?\nNo.\nI mean, you know, like all of us know like 11 things we've read on Twitter or whatever, but like the truth is even the professional staff that wrote it couldn't if you had dinner with them over 3 hours really give you a comprehensive sense of what's in it.\nAnd remember, when it passes, and I think it likely will, um, you know, it's it's the law.\nSo, and that's by design in order of course by design.\nOf course, it's by design.\nIt's just Well, I mean, look, it's, you know, it's just it's just overload.\nYou can't I mean every single part of this this is the economy of the city that I've lived in my whole life.\nEvery single part of this is there by design.\nIt's been managed.\nIt's been thought through.\nIt's been written artfully.\nAnd by artfully, I mean deceptively.\nSo you can't understand its purpose or its benefit.\nAnd literally it is years before the ramifications become clear.\nAnd again, this is why we have committees.\nYou know, a committee masters a subject and then theoretically produces legislation that bears on that subject with, you know, knowledge and depth and hopefully wisdom.\nUm, the Congress is not designed to pass legislation in this way, and we've evolved to this, and I guess I would um encourage the White House to try and blow that up.\nI think it'd be better for everybody if uh you know legislation was passed peacemeal as it always has been.\nUm I think part of the problem is the leadership in the Congress and nobody wants to say it is just embarrassing.\nIt's just totally embarrassing.\nAnd I would say the conference isn't united either.\nI mean this is part of the problem with Trump's agenda.\nUm, it's the beauty of Trump's agenda in my opinion, but it's, you know, it's so different from what your average 65-year-old Republican was raised believing.\nIt's so different from what Fox News is telling you.\nIt's the mirror image of what the Wall Street Journal editorial page is telling you that there just not that many members of the House or the Senate who are truly on board with Trump's message even now.\nAnd of course, they cowtow to the man, but when it really comes down to it, they hate his stated agenda.\nAnd state agenda.\nUnpack what do they hate most?\nWhat do they hate most?\nIt's not even a close call.\nThey hate his foreign policy views.\nThey hate his foreign policy views because look, out of 535 members of the House and Senate, I would say 510 have given up on improving the United States through their jobs.\nLike they they know they can't.\nIt's like intractable.\nThis is their view.\nIt's complex.\nIt's boring.\nIt's difficult.\nAnd it's super hard to solve.\nAnd the numbers in the House and Senate make it practically impossible to move the ball on whatever issue they care about or were elected on.\nAnd so they take all of that energy and they apply it to making the rest of the world better.\nFighting for democracy or you know the the the grander the description, the the less accountability there is.\nYou know, if we're just like fighting for Churchill against Hitler, like it's always a win because we don't know any of the details.\nIt's a simpler Yeah, it's a simpler cause for them to take on than looking at how do we balance what would you like to see Trump do, Tucker?\nWhat would Tucker Carlson advise if you were in the White House, which many people have requested that you do that?\nIf you were at the right hand of the father, what would you tell him to do?\nUnderstand the politician brain, which is reptilian by its nature.\nIt responds only to pain.\nPeriod.\nOnly to pain.\nSo, if you want a politician to do your bidding, it's a super simple conversation.\nDo what I ask or I will make sure you lose your job.\nAnd by the way, Trump has the power to do that, which is what Elon said on Twitter.\nJust put it out there.\nNo, but it's true.\nAnd I do think if there's, you know, a number of criticisms of any living person, but one I would level at Trump is he is he's nice.\nLike he likes to get along with people.\nHe actually doesn't like to fight in person.\nThat is true.\nHe likes to get along with people.\nNo one will believe that, but I've seen it a lot.\nAnd I think it's tough for him to say, it's easy for him to, you know, go after a reptile like Mitch McConnell like at a press conference.\nYou'll make fun of cocaine Mitch or whatever.\nBut to really go to McConnell and say, &quot;Yeah, listen, son.\nYou know, this is going to hurt in in the following six ways unless you obey, you little bitch.&quot;\nWhich is really what he ought to be saying.\nNo, I mean it.\nI absolutely mean it.\nAnd be saying that to all of these guys.\nTom Cotton, are you joking?\nHow does Tom Cotton have a say in anything?\nYou know, and oh, I'm, you know, you're that chairman of the Intel Committee.\nI'm so impressed.\nListen, Tom Cotton, you represent a state that likes me a lot more than you.\nSo, if I find you undermining me, yet again, and Tom Cotton spends an awful lot of time undermining Trump.\nLike, Tom Cotton hates Trump, actually, of course.\nUm, but if I find you doing that, I'm going to take your Senate seat away, and that's going to be really easy for me to do.\nAnd I really wish he would do that.\nIt would only take one cycle to clear out, you know, to really get some discipline like the French in Algeria, you know, for the encouragement of the other.\nThe first guy goes out of the helicopter and then the second guy is super talkative.\nIf you did that in the United States Senate, you would have a much more coherent um party, I think, like in about a cycle.\nA little more leadership, a little more stick than carrot.\nUh, who wants to go next?\nJam or Sax?\nA lot more stick.\nOkay, here we go.\nTucker says more stick.\nSachs, what you're feeling?\nAre we still talking about the Big, Beautiful Bill?\nWhat are we talking about?\nYeah.\nI mean, well, I mean, we're talking about it all.\nEverybody wants to hear, you know, about our takes on the kurfluffle between Elon and uh Trump, obviously, in relation to BBB.\nSo, let's just tackle it or you can pass on it.\nYeah, let's we got to put it out here.\nWe're 40 We're an hour into the episode.\nLet's just talk about it.\nLet me speak to BBB for a second.\nSo, so listen, if the question is whether I can defend a system that produces $2 trillion deficits every year, no, I I can't I can't even defend the Senate rules that require you to get 60 votes for some things and 50 votes for other things.\nI mean, it's all just seems kind of random when you're an outsider.\nBut those aren't the rules is they've got these crazy bird rules and once a year you get to do this reconciliation bill where it only takes 50 votes instead of 60 votes to pass something which means you can actually get something done without the Democrats which is a rare opportunity and you know you just have to basically come up with um a nexus to a budgetary issue and so that's what the BBB has done and as a result of of that conduit it.\nI guess you could say that it's a way for the president to ratify many of his most important campaign promises from the 2024 election.\nAnd so you've got the tax cut extension in here.\nYou've got full funding of of border security for four years.\nYou've got no tax on tips.\nYou've got drill baby drill.\nYou've got the missile defense shield.\nSo these are campaign promises that are important to the president.\nIt's kind of a once in a-lifetime opportunity to pass these things.\nI think that Republicans would be committing political suicide if they don't.\nI mean, the polling on this, I'll give you some numbers.\nSo, first of all, the bill itself is popular despite all the bashing of it.\nI think that popular with who?\nWell, this is a national poll by Signal, which actually has a bias in favor of Democrats by plus 2.1.\nSo, this with the public, it's who haven't read it.\nI know, believe it or not.\nSo, um, what does that even mean?\nThat support for a big beautiful bill plus six increased funding for border security plus 35 that'll probably be even more now that what's going on in LA work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP plus 38 so despite the Democrats carping on that point people really like the idea of of work requirements and then permanently extending the 2017 tax cuts support plus 19 so these are very popular planks of the president's agenda it's the only chance they're going to have to to pass this Look, you know, I I said this three weeks ago on the pod the last few episodes that I don't support the bill because it's perfect.\nI support it just pragmatically because it's better than the status quo.\nAnd my view is that we should take this now.\nWe should get this done and then come\n\n\nBack for more later.\nAnd there should be a big fight over the budget at some point in the future, but this is not the right time to do it.\nWe don't have the votes.\nWe're not organized.\nAnd it would compromise these other promises the president's made.\nAnd the time to really have that battle is at the beginning of the new fiscal year, which is October 1st.\nSo we at some point do need to have a big fight over the budget.\nThere does need to be resistance to the deficit.\nWe can't continue in this current state forever, but I don't think that's the hill to die on right now.\nChamath, your thoughts on BBB and the Kuruffle, if you want it.\nHere's what I'll say.\nI was sad at the end of last week.\nOne is my friend and the other is my president and it seemed like a really profound friendship and so I was bummed.\nHere's what I'll say this week though on a much more positive note.\nI saw Elon on Tuesday and I got to spend a couple hours with him at Tesla.\nHe let me audit a couple of meetings with him actually.\nIt's always fun.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOne was Dojo and then right after that was the Optimus team.\nOne thing I'll say is I've said this before but he attracts these incredible men and women to work for him.\nThey are inspiring.\nJust sitting in a meeting and hearing it what they're doing was amazing.\nAnd then second to see Elon in action at scale in that way is like watching a maestro paint a masterpiece.\nIt's really impressive.\nAnd then separately, I saw President Trump doing a couple of pressers and he was in his zone of excellence.\nSo, it seems like they're going to find some common ground here.\nThey are better together.\nAnd I'll just say Elon, amazing.\nTesla, incredible.\nAnd I would not be sleeping on this company is what I would say.\nJason, what do you think?\nSo, we're not the main characters in this story, obviously.\nAnd when I saw what happened last week, obviously this is one of my best friends for many decades.\nAnd given the popularity of this podcast, my decision was I don't want to insert myself into this, have my quotes or my feelings uh about Trump, about the bill get weaponized.\nAnd that's typically what happens when you have a friend who's the number one story in the world.\nUh and now not friends with Trump, but he is my president as well by default.\nWhat benefit does it have to me to then speak about it and then have everybody weaponize it?\nSo, I know this is hard for the audience to reconcile, but sometimes it's better for me to just step back.\nThat's why you don't see me commenting on Tesla or SpaceX publicly all the time because people weaponize what I say against my friend, and I just don't like that.\nAnd, you know, it it's happened in books.\nIt's happens in news stories.\nSo, when Elon is doing something and it's this intense, I like to just step back and maybe take a beat.\nThat was my decision.\nThat's why I didn't want to do a pod last week.\nEverybody else can speak for themselves.\nThat's where I'm at.\nHow do I feel about it?\nI think Trump uh is making a mistake with BBB.\nI think he should push back on it harder.\nI said that in a previous episode.\nAnd I think Elon's 100% correct about that.\nI also think if either of these parties can't control spending, there needs to be like the Nor what was it?\nThe Norquist um you guys would know more about this, but Norquist pledge, Tucker, where you you know, you agree to not increase taxes.\nI think we need something like that where a reasonable party says we should balance the budget.\nWe have to control the deficit.\nThere should be some pledge like that that we force our elected officials on both sides of the aisle to take.\nAnd I'm going to start pursuing that myself personally.\nYou can go to join thereresponsibleparty.com and I'm just going to start an email newsletter and just talk about it.\nI think there needs to be a pledge that these politicians take to balance the budget and cut the deficit over some reasonable amount of time.\nUh but I wish them both the best and I'm glad that the two of them have reconciled because that's good for the country.\nWe can't have these two giants at war.\nThe greatest innovator in our country and a president who's got, you know, an agenda which I agree with two-thirds of.\nI may not agree with how he's doing immigration on the margins, but I agree with everything else.\nSo, I'm just rooting for the both of them because it's so important that for America that they get along.\nGreat.\nSo, in summary, you're not centering yourself, but you have a website www.\nI have an opinion.\nIt accepts Apple.\nI'm not telling you to go to founderun university.\nIt's $1 a month, but if you subscribe for a year, it's $6.\nYeah, you actually threw in a plug.\nI have an issue.\nI'm throwing a plug in.\nThat was insane.\nI I don't care.\nListen, sign up the responsible party.com.\nI'm going to start my over my own your quiz pledge, but also join.\nIt's insane.\nYou're insane.\nI'd also like to plug Chamath's Substack.\nIt's $1,000 a year to get his reports and uh you can of course buy DavidSacks.com/ucker.\nWhat plugs do you have?\nI've never plugged.\nNo plugs from Tucker.\nTucker, you where what's in the merch store, Tucker?\nYou got to have something in the merch store.\nAlp, America's greatest nicotine pouch.\nThat's all I've got.\nOkay, here we go.\nPlugs central.\nUh, fantastic.\nAll right, breaking news here.\nForeign policy looks like a major escalation with Iran could be happening.\nMaybe on Wednesday, it was reported some US personnel were being evacuated out of the Middle East.\nPartial evacuation of the Iraqi embassy.\nOkay.\nOil prices move 4% on the news.\nLater reported that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran.\nUS thinks Iran could retaliate on spaces in Iraq which explains the evacuations.\nTrump was asked about the evacuation said the following quote they are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place.\nWe'll see what happens.\nThe classic Trump will see what happens.\nAnd then he added they can't have a nuclear weapon.\nVery simple.\nOkay.\nPolymarket odds are spiking on Israel.\nAction against Iran 50%.\nOh boy.\nUh Tucker, can the West allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon or is this more a WMD situation that we referenced at the start of the program?\nIf Tucker Carlson was in the White House, which many of your fans wish you were, what would your advice be here?\nIs it up to us?\nDo we have the power?\nNobody wants Iran to have a nuclear weapon.\nI don't think the Iranians want a nuclear weapon right now by judging by their actions, but it could we prevent it is the question.\nAnd if so, how exactly given that we just lost to Russia and the Houthis?\nUm I'm skeptical.\nUm but I'm amazed by how close we are to military action against Iran.\nIt's no defense of Iran.\nOf course, I'm not a Shiite for the record, but I think it comes with perils that people are not considering or willfully ignoring.\nAnd the main one is Iran is not Iraq or it's not Libya.\nIt's not isolated.\nIt's a it's a central player in bricks.\n90% of of Iran's oil exports go to China.\nIt just signed an defense agreement with Russia in January.\nSo it's not you know what I mean?\nIt has backup.\nIt has big allies that represent the majority of the world's population and the majority of the world's economy and land mass.\nSo the potential for this to become something much much bigger and unmanageable is is real.\nIt's there.\nTheir conventional weapons are fearsome and could do great damage to our allies to Israel and and to American assets in that area and also to energy production um in countries that we we rely on.\nSo I think the downsides are uh are really kind of overwhelming.\nI think um a protracted meaning anything over a day or two uh engagement with Iran would derail the Trump agenda and the presidency and I think it could really sink this administration and so I pray this this doesn't happen.\nI think by the way I think the timetable is distorted.\nThere is absolutely no reason to the president has said repeatedly we will do everything we can to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\nI think it's a completely reasonable goal.\nNobody wants that.\nI certainly don't want that and the Israelis don't want it and the Gulf States don't want it.\nNobody wants that.\nBut it doesn't mean that it has to happen on Friday actually and there are other forces exerting pressure on the administration to get this done quickly even before Steve Wickoff, God bless him, um meets with his counterparts in Oman in a few days from now.\nSo it's like why in the world would you preempt a scheduled negotiation with air strikes which the United States would US is driving is driving this and we're just you know it's it's a it's a combination of both and by the way Israel is a country with 9 million people in it.\nI mean it's it's the Israeli government.\nUm but there also elements of the US government.\nThe head of SenCom you know is in favor of this.\nThere are a number of Republican senators who are in favor of this who are lying.\nFor example, here's one, I think, interesting point, um, that's a statement of fact.\nThere's no American intelligence, this is a statement of fact, that suggests Iran is in the process of assembling a nuclear weapon or within months of doing so.\nThere's none.\nAnd yet Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the intel Senate Intel Committee, is out there saying, you know, we know that they're doing this.\nWell, actually, you don't know that.\nThat's not true.\nWhether he believes it or not, I can't, you know, I can't say, but that's that's a lie.\nOur intel does not say that.\nPeriod.\nSo why so they're lying because industrial uh military-industrial complex?\nYeah.\nI mean I think there a whole it's not it's not as simple as OB wants it.\nI mean I think this is a very complicated um coalition of aligned interests but whatever their motives I don't even need to know their motives.\nThis is not a timetable that we need to adhere to.\nIt's a completely artificial timetable.\nThe president has done his best to resolve this diplomatically.\nThat's clearly his stated preference.\nHe said it a million times.\nAnd he's being bumrushed into making a very uh snap decision that could have bigger consequences than we're thinking through.\nSo, I'm very concerned about it.\nWhat's your thoughts here?\nCan Iran have a nuclear weapon?\nAnd should the United States participate in if they do have um one imminently which is a big debate obviously should we be involved in uh stopping them or should we be doing negotiations soft power etc.\nI think this is where I'm glad that it's President Trump in the seat.\nI think he's shown a consistent desire to offramp all of these conflicts and if he and Witoff can hopefully hold the line with BB and everybody else, I think we're way way way better off.\nBut you see this like every time we're on the verge of victory, somebody in the military-industrial complex invents some, you know, escalation of something so that we can just go to war.\nIt's the the answer always seems to be let's go to war or let's support a war or let's enable a war.\nAnd the bull work to that has been the president.\nIf we go to war, Tucker's right, this totally screws everything up.\nI mean, you could see oil double double.\nWhat What happens to the economy of the world, of world GDP, of everything, of inflation if you have oil at 100 bucks a barrel, 112 bucks a barrel?\nIt's not good.\nSo, you have to wonder like why would people want this escalation?\nWho wants this escalation?\nAnd you see that it's deeply beneficial for America to avoid anything calamitous happening here.\nSo I hope we find an off-ramp and I hope that the president gets his way.\nOne thing people should know about Iran is that there is a massive demographic switch happening here.\nYou can see a chart.\nIs this from your paid newsletter site?\nUh this is Yeah, this is from chimoth.subsect.com.\n$1,000 a year, $700 a month.\nYou get to have lunch with him twice a year.\nIs this is this from choose your responsible party.org?\nWhat's it called?\nNo, this is from founderun university application coming in for around the world.\nUh here we go.\nTake a take your uh nicotine patch and come to founder university.\nIran 2020 uh if you look at the number of millennials, Gen Xers, uh this is not a boomer country and they're going to have a revolution when all those 30 year olds you see there, that big fat middle, 30 and 40 year olds who are on VPNs right now and reading and watching what's happening in the West.\nYou do not need to interfere with this country.\nYou just need to let those 30 year olds become 40 and 50 year olds and take over the country.\nWe need to negotiate heavily.\nThe idea of going in there and creating a war with Iran is exactly probably what those older people want.\nDemographics are destiny.\nUh and this there's an amazing actual Anthony Bourdain episode from Iran and it was he said it was his favorite episode.\nRest in peace Anthony Bourdain.\nBut the demographics here are just going to drive this change.\nYour ability as a moderator to cover so much ground.\nThank you.\nWow.\nCompliment.\nAll right.\nThis is a hard turn to make, Tucker, but this
