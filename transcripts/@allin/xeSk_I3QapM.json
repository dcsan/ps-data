  "cleanText": "What are your thoughts, Friedberg, on the kurfluffle, the Donny Brookke, the bruhaha between Elon and President Trump? There's a lot of people that are making accurate declarations that federal spending needs to be reduced, the deficit needs to be shrunk, we are in a debt death spiral, and they are absolutely correct. So, I don't think that Elon is off the reservation when he makes those comments and he's talked about this continuously and he dedicated months of his life to operating Doge and trying to bring to light some of the extraordinary operating inefficiencies in the federal government that should be addressed and I think, you know, we'll see what happens. Jury's still out. For those actions to get permanent, they I believe need to mandate them in a appropriations bill. And the White House has publicly declared that they are going to move forward with an appropriations bill to try and cement some of the Doge actions. So I'm hopeful, but I think Elon's right with respect to the spending. I will provide the voice I have heard publicly stated from the alternative view from the White House, which is this is not the bill to do that because it mostly focuses on these mandatory spending programs and they are addressing cost savings to some degree in these mandatory spending programs while keeping the tax rates where they are or reducing tax rates in some cases which the expectation is will stimulate GDP growth. So the White House view is also a view that you could look at and say economically I could see a path here that does make sense. You're reducing spending only on mandatory programs. You're going to come back with an appropriations bill to address discretionary spending. And then the final kind of action that the White House might take which we've heard about separately is empoundment that at the end of the fiscal year they may come back and say all the money that we saved by not spending it we can actually recover through empoundment. And the CBO has not accounted for tariff revenue. And just looking at the recent deal done with Vietnam, Vietnam's about $130 billion a year of imports to the United States. And they did a deal that they announced two days ago with a 20% tariff on Vietnam, which you know, if Vietnam's import volume does not increase, is about 26 billion a year of incremental revenue for the federal government. So there's an argument that Bessant and Lutnik and others are making that you guys have failed to recognize that we've got a few other things we have up our sleeve that we're going to do. We're going to do empoundment. We're going to do this appropriations bill. We've got more revenue coming in. Net net. We will get the deficit down to where we need to be. In fact, Scott Besson was on TV saying over and over, we're going to get the deficit below 3% of GDP, which is the key target here. But the immediate reaction to this bill, I think that Elon is having is the same that I've had and it is the same that Senator Johnson had and is the same that many others have had, which is what the f are we doing? We are in a fiscal emergency in this country and we're not addressing it. So, I think both points of view can be valid and both sides can have a good kind of argument for why the bill should be passed and why the bill shouldn't be passed. The White House has declared that this is the only way they're going to get some of the programs done that they believe they need to get done for national security like the ICE border stuff and these are things that they believe they need to get done but a lot of folks are looking at the numbers and saying this just isn't enough and you're now increasing the deficit by cutting taxes. One of the things the CBO does not do though is they don't have a strong model and there's a ton of economic debate on this point which is how do tax cuts stimulate GDP growth and job creation and income growth for people with jobs. The one argument is when you cut taxes, more dollars flow into the economy, more jobs are created, more businesses are created, the GDP grows, income for other people grows. The alternative argument is it's a tax cut for the rich. What are you doing? They're going to put that money in their pocket. It's only going to benefit themselves. So that's I think a key crux in the argument that you'll never get to a resolution on. The one side will use that one argument and the other side will use the other argument. So look, I mean with respect to Elon and Trump, I will say one thing very importantly. I don't think MAGA can exist successfully without the tech alignment. I don't think tech can exist without MAGA because of the government alignment and the importance of the government allowing these new technologies like AI to come to market and to proliferate. I don't think that these two can exist in isolation and in conflict with one another. Elon is the de facto king of tech. he is the person that is saying look if I'm in conflict with Trump tech is in conflict with Trump or that at least that is the perception on the MAGA side and I think that that is very risky for both sides to allow a conflict to kind of endure and I do think that both sides have heads that are going to be cooler that will prevail here and I do think that these two are going to recognize the importance of being codependent if you will in being able to progress their respective agendas. Chimath, your thoughts on the kurluffle seem to be winding down and maybe reaching some sort of endgame. It feels like we're in some sort of an endgame here. And if there is one, what is it? I mean, I think it's just important to recognize that on the one side you have the most powerful person in the world and on the other side you have the most important powerful entrepreneur and richest man in the world. And when you have people that are that accomplished, it's not as if you're going to get along 100% of the time. So I think a lot of the breathlessness around all of this stuff is overblown. I think the reality is that when push comes to shove, I think that they agree on more things than they probably disagree. And I think when everybody realizes that the alternative is essentially some insane form of socialism and redistribution, I think the alliance will hold and that they'll find some common ground. Jason, what do you think? Well, I think you're right. These two individuals are used to speaking their mind and they're both really good at social media and then there's no better media cycle than covering the two of them battling it out and trading barbs. But I think what Elon did this cycle was really interesting. He started a preference stack for Trump and that cascade, preference cascade, preference stack, however you want to phrase it, you know, I think played a large role, if not the role in getting Trump elected. People can debate that. I don't know that you can perfectly know what that $250 million and all that effort he put in, you know, what that did in terms of Trump's chances. Trump probably would have won anyway versus Kamla, but maybe not. Putting that aside, the platform Elon has refined during this political cycle is one that resonates and I think it's a really good idea for him to maybe if he's going to be involved in politics, pull that string and just crisply define it. And I was thinking about it over the last couple days and I think it hits into four basic groups. Balance budget and government efficiency. That's kind of one. fiscal responsibility, sustainable energy, which obviously he's been passionate about, and he's the leader in solar, batteries, EVs, and then manufacturing in the United States, which he also is the leader in, and pronatalism, and just, you know, the uh the population crisis. He really cares about those four issues. So what I think he should do is take that America pack and instead of making it like just pro MAGA, he should just clearly define what it is that he believes. Small set of issues and then he should go and back the people who are running to to be in Congress and senators and just say, \"Hey, here is what I would like you to be in favor of.\" And do what Norquist did with his no new taxes pledge. Do some sort of pledge like that. I don't know if it needs to be a new party, but just really crisply define what matters to him. If he's going to be involved in politics, then get people to agree on it. And if he wants to give them donations, as is his right, as is his pack's right, to raise money, he could represent, I think, a very world positive view. Sustainable energy, just incredible execution, and a really efficient government. He should technical excellence, technical excellence, excellence at large, and America. Just go for it. And and and it doesn't have to be personal against Trump. One of the big problems with Trump is he he has a bunch of sick offense around him and the more you kind of appease him and just blindly follow him, I think the closer you the perception is that's the closer you get to him. I don't know that that's true. I think he likes debating stuff. So, I think he should embrace the people who debate it with him and then those people should just crisply say here's what I stand for and I'm putting my money behind it. I hope we're in alignment, but I'm going to stay in my lane and I'm going to prioritize what matters to me. And Elon's priorities are exceptionally sharp and well- definfined, and he should pursue them. Yeah. Jury's out on where this ends up and the broader picture. You guys will get annoyed because I've talked about Ray Dalio so much, but I think he's done an amazing job in the last 5 years basically explaining everything we've seen from global conflict to the internal conflict, the rise of socialism in the US and the relationship to the debt and deficit cycle. He just posted on Twitter yesterday that he went to DC to discuss the budget deficit with senior people on both sides of the aisle. And he said, \"It's clear to me that we are unlikely to change the debt trajectory we're on and avoid the painful consequences.\" And he talked a lot about this concept of absolutist politics. And this is the same reaction I've had every time I've gone to DC and we've met with members of Congress. And if you guys remember from the beginning, I said Doge isn't going to be it. As much as Elon can identify and resolve to a better way of operating the federal government's agencies, you cannot change the spending without a change in statute from Congress. You have to get Congress to act. And every time I met with members of Congress, their incentive is to keep the money flowing to their districts. That's what they focus on. And every year their districts want more in different contexts, in different forms, through different programs. And that's what their job is. Their job is to go to DC to represent their state's interest or their local district's interests and say we need to make sure that we're taken care of as the money flows. And as a result, everything keeps getting bigger and bigger and spiraling away. At the end of the day, the way we economically save America, if we even have a shot without money printing, which a lot of people like Bology and Dalio and others are now indicating is what's going to happen is we're going to end up inflating away or printing away all of the debt that we've taken on is to get to a 333, which Bessent has highlighted is also his goal. 3% federal deficit to GDP, 3% GDP growth, and 3% inflation. And just to give you a sense of where those numbers sit today, the current estimate is 6% deficit to GDP, 2.4% inflation. So we've actually got a little bit of room to run on inflation. And GDP growth this year of 1.4%. So will the tax cuts in this bill increase GDP growth? Will AI increase GDP growth? The jury is out. Will the tariff revenue reduce the deficit more than the CPO is estimating? And the increased GDP growth reduce the deficit? The jury is still out. And what will happen with inflation? And if the Fed cuts rates, you're going to see inflation climb a little bit more. Maybe the tariffs effect on inflation will still come through. Some folks have said that hasn't hit yet, but it will come later this year. Will we exceed 3%. Inflation TBD. So the jury is still very much out on whether these actions that are being taken, which Bessant has declared is going to get us to that 333 number. But then a lot of folks who are looking at this with a cold stare with like no political influence with no political intention not representing a party not representing an administration like Ray Dalio are saying what the there is no way we're going to get there. Bology I think you know pointed out in his tweet his point is actually a very good point which is our debt is not just the federal debt but there's other debt that we're not even accounting for. consumer debt. I've said this in the past. There's there's actually corporate debt. Yeah. The business debt, consumer debt. There's also state and local debt. And then the one key number that we never talk about is the unaccounted for liabilities in public pension funds, which is on the order of trillions of dollars more. So when you add all of this up, someone's going to pay the bills on all that debt or we're going to have to inflate away that debt by printing money. And at some point, the trains left the station. A lot of people are saying, \"We're done. There's no way out of this. So, you know, the Elon Trump battle is like an interesting kind of side kurfuffle, but it's not really the big story here. The big story is the trains left the\n",
