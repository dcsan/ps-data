  "cleanText": "Little known New York State Assemblyman Zorhan Mamdani took the internet by storm this week. Shocked the world, beating out Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic nomination. Here's the poly market chart. Just crazy. One month ago, Cuomo was at 93%. Zorhan had a 6% chance. My lord, what a flip. A couple of things happened that led to this. Obviously, a bunch of viral moments. He's a great speaker. Reminds me of Vake in that regard. Really good. You know in debates and and speaking publicly started rising in the polls, got a ton of endorsements from millennials, Gen Z, AOC endorsed him as well, and now he is, Mamdani is the 75% favorite to beat Eric Adams, but looks like Eric Adams is going to get a shocking amount of support because people don't want a Democratic socialist who's got some really unique and colorful history of becoming the mayor of one of the greatest cities in the world, my hometown. He wants to have free buses. Doesn't sound like that big of a deal. He wants to freeze rent and triple the development affordable housing. City-owned government grocery stores. That sounds crazy. A $30 minimum wage. New York's at 1650, by the way. He wants to defund the police, replace the cops with social workers in high crime areas. A bunch of really wacky, interesting proposals. And you were, I think, on to this early, David Friedberg, in your predictions last year. You saw this coming again. If you listen to the number one podcast in the world, you're going to get this information a year earlier than everybody else. That's why we are the number one podcast in the world. Friedberg, maybe you talk a little bit about your prediction last year and where we are right now and your reaction to this. I don't know, perplexing, shocking. Is this perplexing, shocking, or obvious to you? For me, it feels like actually a little bit of a beginning of a wave that's going to continue to sweep over this country starting in cities. And I think that we're at the very early stages. I think we'll look back and I jokingly say that Kla Harris is going to look like a conservative candidate pretty soon. And I do think that this is a broad kind of reaction to the economic condition of the United States. And I've talked a lot of people don't quite recognize and see how important the debt and the deficit is with respect to how it's ultimately going to lead to socialism as it has every single time in history when you've had a free voting democracy, a representative democracy that becomes encumbered with too much debt. So Nick, if you'll pull up this chart, it'll just show you a microcosm of it and specifically how it played out in New York and how it will continue to play out in cities. This is the total amount of student loan debt. In the last 20 years, the student loan debt has ballooned from 500 billion to two trillion. Four million college graduates per year in the United States. About 40% of them have student loan debt that they leave. That means that in the last 20 years, 80 million people, young people have graduated from college. And they've accured $1.5 trillion of new debt. And based on the percentage and the distribution, that means the average debt for these individuals is sitting around $60,000. So you're a young person. Where do those young people go? Where do they live? And remember, there's about 32 million of them. They live in cities. They don't go back to rural towns. Most of that population sits in cities. It sits in New York, sits in Los Angeles, sits in Seattle, sits in San Francisco, sits in Portland, and sit in Chicago. And what we're seeing in those cities is a massive political shift. People call it left, but it's actually quite different than just being more traditionally left. It's really a revolution against the system that brought them to this moment because the promise that we gave in America, the American dream was if you will go to college, you will graduate, you will have income, you will have stability, you will be able to buy a home. And what we did is we increased the government's role in making that dream possible. And in doing so, we created effectively a system where we gave unrestricted access to capital which inflated the cost of education. People could go to school like Zoran and major in African studies at Bowden College. They could get a loan and graduate with $200,000, $300,000 of debt and then never get a job. The guy has not had a real job. And this is the truth for 32 million young Americans. They find themselves living in places where they cannot afford to pay their bills every month and they will never get out of the debt cycle that they were thrust into and believe that they were going to be able to graduate from and excel in the world and increase. They all have what is called negative capital. They have debt and they will never be able to get out of that cycle. So where do you turn in that moment? You don't go turn to corporations to solve your problems. You don't go turn to your friends and your siblings and your family. They're not going to bail you out. You turn to the voting booth and you hear a guy like Zoran show up and say there can be a better path forward. The better path forward is the government can and should do more to help. And in doing more to help, we will increase government. We will tax the rich. We will tax the corporations. We will take all of that capital and we will redistribute it in the form of services and checks and support for all of the people that find themselves unable to take care of themselves. And this becomes a tipping point when the majority of the voter base ends up in that situation where they're that deeply in need where they have negative capital. And that is the situation America finds itself in today. There is no easy answer and there is no easy solution out of this. But I can tell you one thing for sure that in historical perspective we have seen it time and time again across dozens of countries that have embraced socialism to get out of the debt cycle that ultimately absorbs and and swallows up the young. It swallows up every family. It swallows up every person in the working class with debt. They're swaddled with it. And they all try and get out of it by increasing government and embracing these socialist concepts. And it has never ever worked. More government is not the answer. Less government is. We can get into that. But if you look at the results, Zoran won 61 to 39 with college educated. Young people voted for him. Old people did not as much. White people voted for him because they went to college. Non-white people did not as much. At the end of the day, young college educated white people elected this guy and that is the beginning of a wave that will sweep over America. And I really do worry about where this takes us. So way to go dummies. Yeah. I mean the you're correct. He won amongst Asians why it's college educated. And to put a finer point on it, Friedberg, it really isn't just college. It's the cost of college. Increases in the cost of college degrees have outpaced the wage growth of entry-level salaries by 10x over the last 20 years. You could go 300,000, 400,000 not in debt, but that might be what you paid for those degrees in those major cities and you don't believe in capitalism anymore and you believe that you need to tax the rich. Just one warning for people in these states, in these cities. We saw this David Sacks in San Francisco. We saw the the the doom spiral. You and I worked on the Chesodine recall and now they have Dan Lori there and things are starting to slowly turn around a bit in Los Angeles. We saw this with Karen Bass. They didn't vote for Rick Caruso. He would have been an amazing mayor. They voted for incompetence. And these people are voting for incompetence and a plan that will not work because two-thirds of the tax base in New York is paid for by the top 10% who are leaving. People will leave. They will see that Austin and Miami are fantastic cities to live in at half the price, a third of the price, and you get a tax break, and you can always go back to New York and California and hang out for a month and get whatever values left in those cities that hasn't been destroyed by these socialists and the incompetent people running them. Sacks, what are your thoughts on what's happening in New York City specifically? Well, you're right that every generation seems to need to learn this lesson for themselves because they don't study history and they they don't see that socialism always fails wherever it's tried. San Francisco went through this. I mean, it was a doom spiral. Uh now, I think we've turned the corner. LA is in the midst of going through it and a large portion of LA just burned down because there's no water in the fire hydrants. Basically, all the public services have been looted and New York is about to learn this for themselves. So it just seems like every generation just has to learn this. There's no way to teach them. So I do think that that is one thing that's going on. I I do agree with Friedberg that a big underlying root cause here is the student debt. It's the fact that these kids have negative capital. They've got no skin in the game. They graduate from college with worthless degrees and massive amounts of debt. That debt was not used to make their education better. Universities have been using the spiraling tuitions to fund massive amounts of bureaucracy, you know, for DEI and woke and all sorts of stuff like that. And these kids have no prospect of getting out of debt or being able to buy a home. So, they just have no skin in the game. And so, this is part of why they're they're turning against capitalism. One thing we need to do, by the way, is we need to make the student debt dischargeable in bankruptcy is one of the it's the only kind of debt that you can't get out of through bankruptcy. And if we were to make that change, at least these kids would have a way out. They have no skin in the game. The universities have absolutely no incentive to keep prices down and create a competitive or economic incentive for making sure that their degrees work. The only group that possibly could would be true capital lenders, people like banks or underwriters that are saying, \"Here's a loan because I expect you to be able to pay it back.\" There's no underwriting in student loans today. There's no underwriting. The student loan program, the federal student loan program needs to go away because when it goes away, if it goes to zero, and people might say, \"Oh, that's awful. You're taking away education.\" What will happen is the capital markets will flood to fill that hole. Banks and lenders will show up and they will say, \"You know what? We'll underwrite the loans.\" But they'll underwrite it by saying good colleges get the get get loans and bad colleges don't. Good degrees get the loans, bad degrees don't. And people that are expected to pay back the loans will now get loans. And all of the rest of the money that's caused everyone to end up in this debt spiral will stop and we'll be able to kind of recover from it. It's ironic that a problem that is being caused by government is going to lead to socialism. It's going to lead to maximum government which will then create the next spiral of problems. But I agree with you. I think this is very sad.\n",
