  "cleanText": "Obviously, oil prices, Chamath, you had\ntalked about those in relation to this\naction. You said, \"Hey, if this goes\npoorly, we could be looking at a $100 a\nbarrel oil.\"\nQuite um interestingly, while it did\nspike a little bit up to $74, almost hit\nyour $100 Chamath, racing up from uh the\n$60 mark, you know, we come back down\nnow. And I think people are energy\nindependence here in the United States\nmakes us not immune to this, but we're\nsomewhat protected. And I think that's\nthe great thing about energy\nindependence.\nBut here we are. The markets have\ndigested this, priced it in, processed\nit in a way that I think maybe none of\nus thought it would. So maybe you could\nunpack your thinking now on the market's\nreaction to the war. The fear that I had\nwas that if there was um protracted\nconflict, what you effectively would see\nis a bunch of supply go offline. And if\nthat supply went offline and as long as\nthe demand stayed even roughly the same,\nyou would see prices go up. My thought\nwas that the price of oil could double.\nI think Goldman had it slightly under a\ndoubling. So that was definitely the the\nfear\nwhat folks had going into that weekend.\nBut coming out of it, this is where I\nthink you have to be very respectful of\nthe fact that the market is really the\nsum of many, many, many millions of\ninformed opinions. And I think what they\nsaw was that\nIran was not really in a position to do\nanything but capitulate and give up. M\nand I think that what they also saw\nwhether you agree with the Israeli\npolicy or not was that they had\nsystematically\ngone from where they are and marched\neastward essentially. They effectively\ndecapitated Hamas. They effectively\ndecapitated Hezbollah. They effectively\ndecapitated the Houthis.\nI think finally putting a nail in the\ncoffin of this Iran nuclear ambition\nprogram was not just important for them,\nbut it's critical for Saudi and the UAE.\nYou\n know, MBS had an incredibly powerful\nquote, which was, \"If Iran gets a\nnuclear weapon, we will have no choice\nbut to get our own.\" Right? So by taking\nall of that risk off the table, what\nyou're now talking about is an enormous\nsupply that could essentially service\nworld productivity needs unhindered\nbecause it's not just Iranian supply.\nYou're talking about Emirati supply and\nyou're talking about Qatari supply and\nyou're talking about Saudi supply. So, I\nthink what the market realized was,\nokay, now the Middle East is the closest\nit's ever been\nto fully monetizing the oil that they\nhave and to invest aggressively into\ntheir own people. The second thing is\nthat Steve Witco\nspoke about the fact that you should\nexpect the Abraham Accords to expand. So\nif you think about that one-two punch,\nnot necessarily from a geopolitical\nlens, but from an economic lens, the\nfirst punch is neutering the Iranians\nability to be chaos monkeys in the\nregion. But the second punch is the one\nthat then now creates normalization\nacross the region with Israel. It double\nand triples down the ability to monetize\noil and start to invest those returns in\nfuture projects that have a much better\nROI. All of that leads to cheaper energy\nand Iran becomes the odd person out here\nin this new, you know, federation of\npeople in the Middle East who want peace\nand normal relations. I think\n it's a\nphenomenal question, Jason, but I think\nthat's what the market sniffed out and I\nthink that's what the market is now\nsaying like that this is a chapter that\nwe can close and move on.\n This could be\na big paradigm shift and framework, the\nmajor part of this paradigm shift that\nwe're seeing here comes from an\ninvestment in energy in the United\nStates since the Iraq war, since the\nAfghanistan war. We now are energy\nindependent. We're a net exporter. We've\ninvested in solar. We've invested in\nwind. We are doing more drilling, nat\ngas. And this week, uh I think we saw\nsome new starts for nuclear as well. So\nthis time around when we look at our\nMiddle East policy, it is not informed\nby our need for that oil. Is that\ncorrect for your friedberg in your mind?\nWell, I think you have to look at it on\na global basis. Iran exports $60 billion\na year and about 55 billion of that goes\nto China.\n And that number is up from I\nbelieve sub 30% just a few years ago or\nsub 20%. So the relationship between\nIran and China and the importance of\nthat relationship to China's economy and\nproductivity I think cannot be\nunderstated. So independent of the\nUnited States on a global stage, the\nsituation with the supply of energy and\nthe partnership on energy with what is\neffectively the US's largest rival now\nis critical to take into account when\ndoing the calculus on how to resolve\nforward here. Which is also why and I\ndon't think that we have perfect\ninformation. I don't think the public\nhas been given perfect information about\nthe statesmanship that's gone on\n between\nthe United States and China or the\nconversations that gone on at a high\nlevel between the US and China or at a\nhigh level between the US and Russia\nregarding what is the right way to\ntransition the region. When I look at\nthe region and when you'd hear about\nother leaders in that region speaking\npublicly, the King of Jordan, MBS from\nSaudi, the Omanis from Bahrain, all of\nthe other leaders in that region, even\nthe Qataris who seem to kind of try to\nstraddle both sides here, they all seem\nto have a very strong imperative and\nincentive to modernize the Middle East,\nto bring those economies into the global\nstage, to bring them into kind of a\nmodern economy. Well, Jason, I know\nyou've talked about this and you visited\nand the rest of us obviously have\nrelationships there, but there's a\nstrong demand and a strong interest in\nthis region in modernizing. And that\nmodernization is going to benefit the\nworld because they will ultimately be\nnet exporters. They will ultimately net\nnet producers of things that everyone\nelse will buy and participate in. And\nthey will also be very big consumers.\nThey are already\n very big buyers of\nAmerican technology and American\nbusinesses and also big financiers of\nglobal capitalism. So in that context, I\ndon't think it's just about, hey, we got\nto go get the oil, or hey, we got to go\nget the energy. It's about how do you\nbalance China's need for energy, how do\nyou balance the Russian incentives, and\nhow do you help the rest of that region\nmodernize? And I think that's where\nthere's a very complex dance underway\nthat we have very little insight into\nthe details of those conversations. And\nI'm not going to just sit here and be\nlike very flippant about, oh, we should\ndo this or we should do that because\nthere's a lot at play. And I think that\nthat is in my opinion the net calculus,\nthe bigger picture calculus that's\nunderway. Yes.\n",
