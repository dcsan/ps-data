  "cleanText": "Freberg, your thoughts on states?\n\nYou know, we talked about state rights here in relation to abortion, guns, gun regulations, cannabis, many different, you know, debates over who should get to decide for the country. Where do you stand on this one? Should states have a voice in how AI is deployed in their, you know, borders, uh, within their borders, or should the Federal government take this? And if so, for how many years? Because that seemed to be a sticking point.\n\nLook, I I'm a big believer in the construct of our federated republic in the United States where states can operate with as much kind of discretion as they choose to with the laws that they pass and how they intend to govern. There are however things that affect more than the state. We have interstate commerce. We have international commerce. We have the open internet. And we have a lot of other systems at play here that extend beyond the boundaries of a state. And the way that AI tools and AI systems and AI services and AI related jobs are being deployed and activated, I do think it's critical that we treat AI regulation at a national level, at a Federal level. To date, there have been, I believe, 70 state laws or statutes passed thus far in the United States with, I think, over a thousand having been proposed to date, if the numbers are right. And having a patchwork of regulations on, for example, model development or telling software companies what software they can deploy would make it practically impossible for internet service providers like a Google or an OpenAI to service customers across state boundaries in a way that is actually going to meet the needs of the customer. This is a huge detriment to consumers and a huge detriment to the job market if we end up creating a patchwork of regulations on AI this early. One of the things that I would point out is that much of the early legislation, like for example, what we saw in California, if you read that legislation that did not get signed by Gavin Newsome in California, there was a definition on model parameters being a a boundary condition for whether or not something would go through a regulatory review process. That was such a naive assertion that early in the phase of AI technology development. And think about the implication was okay well everything is LLMs but there's other models like vision action models that are going to be used in robotics models that might be used in predicting and driving physical systems like in self-driving cars for example. So the way that the regulation gets written will often be done in a naive context in a limited fashion by regulators that don't fully understand the breadth of the technology that's coming our way. And I do think that it needs to be kind of leveled up and allowed to operate at a Federal level. So I think it is absolutely critical not just for technology companies, not just for the industry, but for the opportunity for job creation, for improving the economy, for driving GDP and productivity growth that we get something passed that forces AI regulation to be done at a Federal level. Even though I generally agree that states should be able to self-govern, this just has too much of a interstate and global interaction. That was the biggest disappointment for me in the negotiation that's gone on with this bill is that of all the things that I thought were going to be passed that I thought were maybe not ideal, getting this AI Federal preemption in that bill was probably the best thing, the top of the list for me in terms of critically important for the US economy.\n\nYeah, Chimat, your thoughts here? Obviously, abortion is like an interesting one to look at because that went to the states in furtherance of Freeberg's, you know, position here. You have just many different rules and regulations between Texas, Oklahoma, whatever it is. Everybody's got a different view. It's chaotic and we don't have a singular point of view on it. Therefore, women in one state have very different rules than in another state. So, where did you fall on this one? Federal legislation or is it just going to take more time to figure this out? I mean, that that's another I guess angle here.\n\nYeah. This is nothing like abortion. Okay. Abortion is an individual issue between a woman, her doctor, her partner, her god. And so a state being able to have rules and then allowing that woman to choose which state she can go to is quite reasonable because I think that it acknowledges that there's no one-size-fits-all. So that is clearly a state issue. But the reality is that AI is of national security importance. It is the tip of the spear of our ability to have technological supremacy. That is how we have economic supremacy. And so not governing it at the Federal level, I think, is a mistake. And it makes as much sense for states to legislate AI as it would make sense for states to have competitive armies. It doesn't make sense. There are certain things that are just so fundamentally primary to American supremacy and safety and security that it needs to be regulated at the Federal level and I think AI needs to be at the top of that list. So I was disappointed that we weren't able to see the forest from the trees here. Now I'm sensitive to part of the reasons why many of the states have very specific issues around child safety that they mentioned in Tennessee. There was a lot about copyright ownership related to musicians and their content. I get all of that. Those are legitimate things that need to get ironed out. But I think that it could have been done in a Federal framework. Not having it, I think the risk is that if you have 50 different sets of regulation, and it won't even just be 50, as Freebick said, it's going to be, you know, all kinds of pet organizations that pop up in all of these states. What happens? I think what it does is it slows down startups and smaller companies who won't have the economic heft to fight these regulations or to work with them or to figure it out and it'll advantage a handful of incumbents. And the problem with that is that our incumbents aren't yet mature and this industry is still developing. So I think this is um this is one of the unfortunate parts of what is otherwise a a pretty reasonable bill.\n\nWell, you uh can look at gambling, I guess, and cannabis legislation. These are things that Americans largely want to do, and they are fighting their way state by state. And at some point, we may have a Federal regulation about online gambling, right? Uh right now, it's a patchwork. Same thing with cannabis, psychedelics, all a patchwork of different states. Why do you lump together things that are about individual rights with AI, which I I don't think is I don't think is about that. People might look at the rights of rights holders, cars, these AI things are going to hit people on an individual level. So I I think when you bring this up this topic, there are people who feel this is an individual sovereignty issue, right? But you know, there are other issues of individual sovereignty like the ability to take drugs and there's still Federal mandates that come through the FDA. you know, you're not allowed to short circuit or circumvent that framework at a state-by-st state level.\n\nYeah, that actually is at the core of the cannabis debate is would they enforce the Federal laws on cannabis and they haven't, right? So, that was part of I'm talking about more as it relates to AI. Sure. You know, because AI means everything. I think that's what makes this issue very difficult. AI is going to affect everything, right? So probably the people who want to slow this down and have the states do it are saying let the states have their say on these granular issues. I'm not saying this is my position but I think that's what I'm reading into their position. Hey this is going to affect different states in different ways. Let them figure it out. Take some time and then we'll build towards a a framework nationally which I think is what happened with the internet in section 230 as well. Although I don't know the entire history of it. We did come up with an idea that hey the Federal government makes it common carrier to you know anybody can post anything on a website and then you know you can request to take it down. That was Federal legislation. Those things could have been held also on a individual basis and then what would have happened for the internet? You would have had to have AOL or Geo Cities have a different patchwork like you're saying in regulations.\n",
