  "cleanText": "All right, there's lots to discuss in the news. We'll shift from conspicuous consumption and talk about the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. It's two weeks later, obviously. A quick recap here, and then we'll get the besties' take on where we're at today, June 26, when we tape this. Friday, June 13th, Israel launched a surprise attack, took out a bunch of Iranian military officials, some folks who work on the nuclear program, and they traded missiles for about a week before everybody debated if this was going to be World War II. And on Saturday, June 21st, quite shockingly, the US jumped in and carried out Operation Midnight Hammer. I've had a couple weekends in Vegas that have been called Midnight Hammer. Oh yes, Midnight Hammer, also known Wow. There we go, folks. Over a dozen bunker buster bombs on two, maybe three, of Iran's key nuclear facilities, Fordo and Natans. These bombs weigh 15 tons each. They'll go deep underground. Israel doesn't have them. And that's the reason we're given of why we were pulled into this is because we're the only people in the world who could have taken these out. On Thursday morning, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dan Kaine, showed a video. If you haven't seen it, folks, this came out this morning. And here's the video. It's a video of what they call a massive ordinance penetrator. Yeah. It basically goes through the ground. I think in this case, it's going through a ventilation shaft, and it doesn't immediately go off. It basically burrows to its maximum depth and then goes off. This looks like a test to me. This is just demonstrating it. This is how it works. Yeah. And so, uh, here's the before and after photos you've probably seen. Kind of hard to understand what's going on here except for the discolorization. Obviously, we're going for things under ground. And then, shockingly, Iran did a, um, a, I don't know what you'd call this, a ceremonial response sacks where they send some missiles to one of our bases in Qatar. They gave us a ton of notice. None of them landed. And then, uh, both countries have been bombing each other a little bit after Trump said he negotiated a ceasefire, which made our president a little bit upset. Here's the clip of the president not dropping a MOAB, but dropping an F-bomb. Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, \"Okay, now you have 12 hours.\" You don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So, I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the they're doing. Do you understand that? Trump is not happy. He did the lean in. Did you notice the lean in there, DavidSacks, when he dropped the f-bomb? Well, in fairness, President Trump's not the first president to drop an F-bomb in frustration with Netanyahu. It was reported back in the 90s that Bill Clinton, when he had to deal with Netanyahu as being very obsinate and was basically rejecting all of Clinton's intreaties and plans, Clinton is reported to have said, \"Who's theing superpower here?\" You know, in frustration. So, this is not the first time that an American president has gotten frustrated with Netanyahu. But I think people reacted quite well to that on the whole because it showed that President Trump was willing to, well, first, first of all, he negotiated this ceasefire, which was amazing. Then what happens is that, you know, there was this deadline, and it's like in a fight where they ring the bell and the fighters keep slugging with each other. Yeah. It's like they both want to get a few extra hits in. Mhm. And that's licks. That's Yeah. They got some last licks in. But President Trump negotiated the ceasefire, which was extraordinary. And then he's willing to reprimand Israel for basically violating the ceasefire too, which you have to do if you want to enforce it. So I think that's basically what happened there. Now you, DavidSacks, I'm sure the audience wants to challenge you on this. You were, hey, Trump is a never get involved in forever wars. Obviously, it looks like this might not be a forever war, which would be fantastic if that turns out to be the case. And, um, you were saying, hey, the reason to vote for Trump is he won't get us into another war, and here we go. Uh, and obviously Tucker, Tulsi, there's a number of people who did not want to do this, and you were one of them. So, how do you reconcile all of this as somebody who did not want to see us do this? President Trump accomplished that. We're not in a forever war. We're not in a war with Iran. You look at Mark Levin today, he's apoplectic because he and people like him were advocating for a regime change war. And they felt like this was the perfect opportunity to drag the United States into such a war. And President Trump resisted that and instead negotiated a ceasefire. So it seems to me that he lived up to exactly his promises on this. Look, I think President Trump had to thread a very difficult needle here. If you look at polling, the vast majorities of the American population believe in two things. Number one, they don't want Iran getting a nuclear weapon by like 80 something percent. They also by 80 something percent don't want to get dragged into a new forever war in the Middle East, right? They don't want to be in a long protracted war with Iran. President Trump managed to accomplish both those objectives. He took out the Iranian nuclear sites in these highly precise targeted strikes, but he did not get dragged into a new Middle Eastern war. In fact, he negotiated a ceasefire and at least an end to the war right now between Israel and Iran. I think there's very few leaders who could have threaded this needle. Imagine if Kamala Harris were president, just do the counterfactual. Would she have had the situational awareness to realize that when the Iranians struck at our base in Qatar, that it was performative, that it was telegraphed, and that it was meant to basically be for domestic consumption and end the war? She might have escalated it. Certainly, you know, a lot of the neocons who were on social media were saying, \"This is our chance.\" Right? When when the Iranians engaged in that performative hit on on Qatar, they were saying, \"We got to escalate. We got to basically bomb all of Iran now and get into a big war. And Trump, he had the overall awareness of the situation to avoid that. And this goes back to his experience with Solommani back in the first Trump administration. The Iranians did the the same thing where they fired some missiles at American bases, but they were telegraphed. We were told in advance they were coming. They were easy to avoid. No Americans got harmed. And then Trump ended the conflict there. And I think that a lot of presidents might have gotten sucked in to a new Middle Eastern war. Chimath, let me pull you in here. Uh, obviously, little cognitive dissonance, folks didn't want to go to war, but we don't want WMDs in the hands of Iran. How do you reconcile all of this? Is the outcome make it okay, uh, in your mind, or would you rather have seen we not get involved in this? Can I uplevel this slightly? I think that this has been probably the most important week, and I would almost say most important few months in US politics in 30 or 40 years, and the reason is that it starts to converge a bunch of things together that I think are really worth putting on the table. So from my perspective, I think what President Trump has done is almost single-handedly bring back the United States as the global superpower. And I would put that in all caps. So what does it mean to be a superpower? I've said this several times, but just to be slightly redundant. In order to be a superpower, I think you need to have three things, but they work in a hierarchy. The first is that you need to have technical supremacy. And then from that technological supremacy, you need to establish and project economic supremacy and military supremacy. So if you look at the first one, you saw a tactical demonstration of technological supremacy with the B2 bombers. But taking a more general step back, if you look at the largest companies in the world, who are the ones that are actually driving the world forward, these are all American companies. I think these last few months you've seen America firing on all cylinders technologically, economically. At the same time, you now have the stock market back at all-time highs. You have interest rates incredibly starting to compress even in the absence of the Federal Reserve willing to act on data. So, you're projecting economic supremacy. And then these last few weeks, frankly, have been a pretty clear-cut case of military supremacy. And so I think what's pretty simple now is like the US is essentially telling the world our words carry weight again. We're going to shape the global order. Countries will now have to calibrate their actions around what the US is willing to tolerate and what it isn't willing to tolerate. And in the case of Iran, the president made those lines, I think, really crystal clear. He warned them a 100 times where the line was. And he was clear. You cannot build nuclear weapons. And when the line was crossed, and look, I think the the CNN's of the world want to debate that the line wasn't crossed. All I can tell you is I don't know because I don't have access to the intel. I believe what he and Tulsi Gabbard and JD Vance and Marco Rubio and Pete Hexith are saying is that they crossed the line, and then he showed that he will use decisive military force when that happens. But then here's what's crazy, and this is where I think you become a real superpower. It's what happens after once you cross the line. You notice that he doesn't try to humiliate or dominate Iran. He tells Iran that he wants them to stabilize themselves. He told them that he wants to see them trading oil with China. He wants to see them improving the lives of their people because he realizes that a stable Iran is a stable Middle East. So, I think it's really amazing. And then the the fact that he was able to bring Israel and Iran, who's been on the verge of some kind of conflict for decades, and broker a ceasefire, it's a really important moment, I think, in American history. I really do think that if you look at my little framework, it is the closest thing for us to being able to say that we are truly a clearcut singular hegeimon global superpower again. And that's really exciting. Well, he did he definitely did provide that golden bridge for Iran to to cross over to and maybe move into another phase. But friedberg, maybe you could steal me in the other side of this just for the discussion here. This could have gone another direction. We could be sitting here and there could be terrorist attacks or sleeper cells, you know, in the United States. It could turn out when we do the postmortem here that they weren't close to having a nuclear bomb and we did this and we got goated into it. So maybe obviously things have gone well to date, but things might not have. So maybe you could steal man the other side of this. What's the argument for not having done this? And, uh, what if things had gone another way? How bad could this be? Um, I don't know if this is over, and so well, that's my point. Yeah. I mean, we're kind of in the middle of a choose your own adventure book here, and I've got to imagine that the Israelis and Netanyahu, who's been pretty vocal about this regime that's been shouting for decades now, death to Israel, death to the USA, needs to change, is going to suddenly say, hey, let's take a beat and walk away from this, and we'll all kind of have peace in the Middle East. I think we've got to expect that there's another page to turn that's coming. And I don't know if you guys heard, I don't know if it's genuine or if it's authentic or not. Did you hear that audio of one of the kind of Mossad or IDF people calling an IRGC commander and telling him that he has 24 hours to leave Iran with his wife and child? Did you guys hear that? Yeah. No, I have not. I saw it. Yeah. I mean, I heard it. It's pretty incredible. And I've got to imagine that there's going to continue to be effort to destabilize whatever regime remains in Iran by Israel, Mossad, and this isn't going to be kind of a a quiet peaceful transition. There's going to continue to be more conflict. Whether these guys are going to be trading missiles back and forth tomorrow, I think, you know, we don't really know. But this isn't over. And I do think that the next set of actions is going to be critical. But what I was pretty surprised by, I did not like everyone was saying, \"Hey, we're on the brink of World War II.\" I mean, there was some serious statesmanship that must have gone on to keep China. And I have no idea. I've had no insight or conversations with anyone to give me any sort of proprietary access to knowledge about what's going on here. But I've got to imagine there were calls to China and Russia that kept them in the loop and kept them in play on how this all played out. Because China and Russia, the whole fear was this was going to create this magnet in the Middle East that everything was going to rush in and we're going to catalyze World War II, and it didn't happen. So, I do think that, you know, first of all, nothing that folks predicted actually happened, and no one predicted what did happen. So, I I'm not going to sit here and try, right? I mean, and I'm not going to sit here and try and predict what happened next. And I will say if I'm thinking about like, you know, game theory optimal poker play, I got to give credit to this president because it was completely unpredictable what was coming next. And I don't think that there was a really clear path on what he was going to do. Just like was what has happened repeatedly. Everyone always slams a table and says he's starting World War II. He's driving economic collapse. Everything's about to end. And then it turns out he kind of ducks and weaves and finds his way through.\n\n\nAnd everyone's like, \"Holy, I didn't expect that to happen.\nThat was very unpredictable what's going to happen next.\nSo, I am not going to sit here and try and estimate what's going to happen next.\nI can tell you I don't think the Israelis are going to sit by quietly and allow this Iranian regime to continue to go out and build up a military that's constantly shouting death to Israel, death to the USA.\nAnd I think that they've taken their first shot and I don't think it's their last.\nSo, we'll see how this all plays out.\nI really don't know.\nWell, I'm sure.\nI'm sure that's\n",
