  "cleanText": "We bought two used post office trucks on eBay. One was five on eBay.\nYou bought them on eBay?\nWe bought them on eBay. It was click, click, deliver it here. They were about a truck. Um, and one was $2,500, one was $5,000. We found someone in Astoria, Queens to retrofit them into ice cream trucks. You know, all the credit cards were maxed out, everything. You notice on day one, we probably had, you know, $500 in our bank accounts collectively. A week before Christmas, maybe gosh, probably only like 10 years ago. Um, there was no finance team, you know, I did the books and I said, \"Wait a minute, we're going to be negative, you know, $200,000 in a week.\" And I'm like, \"Shit, not a good moment.\"\nYeah. Not a good moment. I don't know how we got here, but that's not going to work, right?\nHow big is the business today?\nSo, in 2025, we started with 70 corporate-owned scoop shops. We will open 35 this year. So, we'll actually grow 50% on our scoop shop footprint this year. Um, wholesale is in 15,000 doors with over 50 SKUs. Um, we, I think by July, we'll hit about 2,000 total team members. Um, most of that are in the retail stores. Um, so growing rapidly. I'm Jeff Berman, your host. This week on the show, a conversation with the CEO and co-founder of Van Leeuwen Ice Cream, Ben Van Leeuwen. He's the mad scientist behind the company's wildest flavors. You may have seen their viral Kraft Mac and Cheese or Hidden Valley Ranch ice creams online and also its incredibly delicious approach to classics. The New York Times Wirecutter called its vanilla the very best on the market. Fair warning, this episode might make you drool.\nThis is Masters of Scale.\nBen, welcome to Masters of Scale.\nThank you.\nI, uh, I love your product. It is so much fun for me when I get to have a conversation with a founder, with an entrepreneur who, who, um, has started a company that I'm just, I, I just love. Uh, so the starting an ice cream company is not the obvious path for every entrepreneur. Take me back. Where, where did this come from?\nEntrepreneurial drive. I think it's in my blood. My dad has been a serial entrepreneur since\nC R I A L, not C E R E.\nYes. Yes. Yes. Exactly. Since he was in high school. Um, so yeah, I think it's part of my DNA. But Van Leeuwen Ice Cream actually came from my first summer job before college. That was the impetus. I drove a Good Humor ice cream truck where I grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. And I loved it. I loved the hospitality aspect, interacting with people. Um, the product itself was prepackaged strawberry shortcake bars, which actually Van Leeuwen makes a Van Leeuwen version of that now, which is really good. Um, I was always partial to the Good Humor Chocolate Clair bars. Those were those were my favorites.\nYeah, really good.\nUm, I did that for two summers. After the second summer of doing that, I decided I didn't want to go back to college. Um, I had saved up enough money from driving that truck to go backpacking throughout Europe and Southeast Asia.\nUm, but that was a very formative experience and the decision to do that kind of changed the course of my entire life because it wasn't a rational decision like especially having grown up in Greenwich, Connecticut, an environment where it's amazing, you know, ambitious, people are interesting and um, just want to do big things. Um, but that path there, at least the way I saw it, was you go to the best college you can, you get the best grades you can, and you hopefully get a job in finance, right? Um, or maybe law or maybe medicine. Um, I never had great grades, maybe 2.8, 2.9 GPA. Um, so when I decided to go travel, you know, it was sort of the opposite of that path. And I wanted friends to come along with me. I didn't want to go alone. Like I'm a really social person. I don't do well on my own. Um, but all of my friends, you know, all these guys are still like some of my best friends on earth were like, \"No, no, Ben, we can't do that. You know, this is it's going to look so bad on our resumes to take a year off college.\" And I was like, \"But I want to do it.\" So, I think the lesson there was like go with what attracts. I guarantee you if I didn't go on that trip, I wouldn't have started an ice cream company.\nWhy? Why not? Um, a, it was formative in like learning about food and learning about really good ingredients. But more than that, why is Van Leeuwen going to open its 100th store this year? Not because we're brilliant, not because we came up with an incredibly novel product, but Van Leeuwen's going to open their 100th store this year and we're going to be the almost biggest artisanal ice cream company in the US, the biggest consumer market on Earth, simply because we decided to do it.\nYeah. I mean, I think there's a lot to be said for it's not just making a decision. It's making a decision that flies in the face of everything you've been raised to do, you've seen around you, the definition of success around you. It sounds like you really just listened to what was inside of you. And even when you couldn't persuade a friend to join you, you were like, I'm doing it. I'm going\ntotally.\nSo, on that trip through Europe, through Southeast Asia, what did you learn about food and ingredients? And then what did you learn about yourself?\nWhat struck me the most about food, particularly like in, I remember going, you know, to the first grocery store I'd ever been to in Italy, and it wasn't a fancy grocery store. They don't really have fancy grocery stores there, yet every grocery store is almost as fancy as the fanciest store in America, 'cause I always say there's no foodies in Italy. It's just Italians, right?\nLike yes, you care about your olive oil and your cheese and the quality of your pasta and that without even realizing it, then I was like, it is so, it was so exciting to me that food, this thing you do three times a day, which is something I was excited about, is normal to be excited about in other places and to care about and to put a lot of time into and to, you know, value, you know, in a really high way, right? Because I value it a lot. I mean, my, my food experience is every day. It's like, you know, some of the most important parts of my day is eating and what am I going to eat? Um, so I learned a lot about that there.\nSo you, you, you came back to the States from your travels. At what point did you say we're really going to do this? I'm going to, I'm going to launch an ice cream.\nWell, I came back to the States for my travels. I went to college. I finished college. Um, I really looked up to my sister after college. She worked at Goldman Sachs. Then she worked at Newberger Berman, and she started her own private wealth management firm and I looked up to Jenny because she was really responsible and she made a good living and I said I want to do that and I didn't really think it through because I didn't have great grades. I'd done no internships. Um, so I said, \"Jenny, can you help me get a job like one of the ones you had?\" And she's like, \"No, you know, she's like, I, I can try, but it doesn't work that way.\"\nAnd after meeting her one day in the city, I saw Mr. Softy truck. And in that moment, um, I always say I didn't have an idea in that moment. I made a decision in that moment. So, so that's where the decision piece comes in. For some reason, I, I didn't say, \"Oh, I have an idea to start an ice cream company.\" I said, \"Oh, that's what I'm going to do.\" It was so clear and I was so excited. I saw this Mr. Softy truck. And by the way, I don't think this was a great idea. But I said, I'm gonna get an ice cream truck and I'm gonna learn how to make ice cream and I'm gonna find the best ingredients I can and I'm gonna sell that ice cream off this truck.\nAnd had you made ice cream before?\nNo history? So I mean, where do you even start then?\nLong before I had made ice cream, I started writing the business plan.\nHis brother Pete and his then romantic partner Laura O'Neal loved the idea too. They became Ben's co-founders.\nAnd then once we had more confidence that we could do it, I said, \"Okay, we better figure out how to make the ice cream.\"\nWhat year are we in?\n2007. I had Thomas Keller's Bouchon cookbook. Okay.\nUm, not a pastry book, but there was a recipe for crème anglaise, which you can turn into vanilla ice cream in there, right?\nAnd I made that and had a lot of cream and a lot of eggs. And what was really exciting about making that and tasting, we said, \"Whoa, this is, you know, the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had.\"\nHuh.\nAnd it was really easy to make. And all it has is cream, eggs, sugar, milk, a little bit of sea salt, and whole vanilla beans.\nUm, and you put it in the freezer and it stays good for months or years. So, we're like, \"Wo, you can make the best ice cream ever and it's completely preservable. You don't need to add any weird stuff.\"\nOkay. So, you, you, you've got a business plan. You've got a recipe for one ice cream.\nWhat's, what's the leap to actually starting a company, raising money, figuring out your supply chain, all of that? Like, how did you get from A to B there?\nFor some reason, we came up with a quarter million is the number.\nOkay.\nUm, you know, it would be enough to buy a brand new Chevrolet truck, pay a lot to turn it into an ice cream truck. Um, you know, probably have a $100,000 bucks on the balance sheet to get us through the first year or two if we weren't making money.\nAnd\nwe set out to try to raise money and everybody said no.\nWhat, what were they telling you when they were saying no? What were you hearing?\nIt's funny. I have such a, I, I have a way of not remembering anything that I don't love.\nI mean, I was, I, I was annoyed by and disappointed, but I wasn't discouraged. I was never discouraged just because\nyes, I believed in myself, but also it's like I was like, I'm hardwork. I have a good pallet.\nI know I'm going to be able to sell ice cream off a truck and make money. You know, I know I'll be able to pay everyone back. So, I just kept going, kept going. And I had this really beautiful business plan. It was 60 pages. And at this time, I lived in Greenpoint with Laura O'Neal, who at that time we were in a relationship.\nNow, we're just co-founders and best friends on earth. Um,\nI want to come back to that in a minute.\nSo, it was her and I, my brother Peter, and our friend, one of my best friends, Ben Colombo, all living in this apartment on Driggs Avenue. And um, McInness in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. So, I got $2,500 here, $5,000 here, 15 from a college professor, Christian Brahmer, um, 15,000 from one of Laura's best friends from Australia. My dad put in 25. So, we cobbled together only $60,000. So, we had tried to raise 250, we only raised 60. Um, and that was enough not to buy a new truck because just the new truck before you turned it into an ice cream truck would have been 70,000.\nSo, we bought a used post office truck. Actually, we bought two. We started with two. We because we were like, \"Wait, these used trucks are cheap. Let's just get two.\" We bought two used post office trucks on eBay. One was 5 on eBay.\nYou bought them one on eBay.\nWe bought them on eBay. It was click, click. Deliver it here. They arrive on a truck. Um, and one was $2,500, one was $5,000. We found someone in Astoria, Queens to retrofit them into ice cream trucks. You know, all the credit cards were maxed out, everything. You notice on day one, we probably had, you know, $500 in our bank accounts collectively.\nUm,\nit was a ton of work though. And and what I find really striking about what we were able to do with $60,000 18 years ago is\nI, I have so much more experience now. I know so much more about business. I am, you know, 50 times more sophisticated in every business department. Yet, I don't think\nI could do half of what I did then with 60,000 with even half a million dollars today.\nWhy is that? It's a weird phenomenon.\nYeah.\nI think when you're, you know, part of it is is age. When you're that young, you know, there's a different kind of energy. Part of it is an age, but it's just the hunger and the pressure to have to do it. But I mean, what we accomplish with that, like the website we built, the graphic design we did, the marketing, the product development. Um, I'm struck by how much we could do with so little.\nUm, but I think this phenomenon, you know, you see it in business. This is why the Unilevers, the Nestle's cannot do what we did, you know, cannot start it even with all the resources in the world. Like when you get big, your, your brain changes. You know, you're really good. You become good at running big organizations, but harder at starting something in a scrappy way.\nSo you've got 60 grand, you got two trucks, you got someone in Astoria, Queens who's who's making them work for ice cream. You got 500 bucks left. How do you get to market?\nDay one\nwe\nWell, getting to day one was hard. You needed a special permit to vend in New York City, a mobile vending permit.\nMhm. And are you manufacturing in a home kitchen at this point or\nyou're manufacturing in a cracker in upstate New York because we didn't have any money to buy these,\nyou know, hundreds of thousands of dollars\nrecipe testing? Had you like, like where were you in your product development?\nincredibly extensive and exhaustive recipe testing. So, we\n\n\nTested, for example, over 50 different chocolate recipes with 15 different kinds of chocolate, different levels of everyone. We narrowed it down to 10. So, I think we had 10 chocolates that we loved. We had 10 vanillas, we had five mint chips, we had seven gingers. Um, you know, so we had probably a hundred flavors and we invited 50 people over to our apartment and we had the greatest party ever.\n\nOh, it was awesome. And we had everybody fill out surveys. What do you like? What do you like? What do you like? Um, so we did really, really rigorous, you know, market testing, you know, for no money. And and that's sort of where I'm getting back. Like if Van Leeuwen were to attempt to do that now in a regular way, that study would cost $30,000 to $40,000.\n\nYou're waiting on the permit.\n\nWe're waiting on the permit. You're you've got a co-packing location up. Every week we're going to try to get the permit, but then the person doesn't show up. So, it's really discouraging and then finally after six weeks of doing this, it's late June, it's almost July, so like missed those great spring months. Um, and we knew about this because we had run the Good Humor Trucks. So, we knew, you know, you have four months of really, really good sales. Um, then finally, I think it was June 21st, we get our permit, and we are so excited. So, we get the permit on this first truck. Finally, we parked on the corner of Green and Prince and Soho. And by the time we opened the window, there was like a line of 15 people.\n\nUm, and why'd it work, right? Why'd it work right away? The truck looked really nice. It had this beautiful solid butcher block counter. Um, so it had a homeier feel than most food trucks. And we were serving 10 flavors of ice cream. So, Hudson Valley Red Currant, Sicilian Pistachio, a really good Michelle Kazelle chocolate, but it worked, I think, because of the distinctness of the truck. And then people were happy to have a product, I think, that was so clean label, not because the label read, but because I really still believe like the best ice cream is made with just milk, cream, sugar, eggs, and, you know, a little bit of salt, but nothing else. I like it better without the stabilizers.\n\nDid you come back to that location the very next day? Did that become the truck?\n\nIt became the location for I think our first three or four years. It was Green and Prince every day from 10:00 a.m. till 5:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m. And then Soho would kind of die cuz it was mostly retail driven. Um and then we would drive up to University and 12th Street, University and 12th or 11th, um in Greenwich Village and stay there till midnight.\n\nVan Leeuwen started as a family business. Ben's co-founders were his brother Pete and his then girlfriend Laura O'Neal. Ben and Laura got married the same week they started the company in 2008. They divorced a few years later, but they remain co-founders. She now describes him as a best friend and business soulmate. All right, so let's talk about Laura for a second. Um, uh, you went on to marry Laura.\n\nYes. Um, uh, we had Estair Pell on the show recently and, uh, she talks about how 65% of startups that fail fail because of co-founder relationships falling apart. Um, you and Laura ended up getting divorced, but you talk about her as your best friend. You've remained business partners. How I I think for anyone who's been divorced, for a lot of people divorced, this is hard to imagine. How have you managed to make this work?\n\nUm, I mean it wasn't hard at all. I mean it was effortless. Um, I mean we were very young when we got married. Laura's from Australia. Um, but we wanted to continue running the business together. We were really excited about it. Um, and we just continued being great friends and doing things together. Um, Laura and her partner Greg who are like my family have a four-year-old. Um, I'm super close with her. Um, so yeah, they're I mean we're best friends but also like family.\n\nWas there a concern when you guys were separating on the personal side that would affect the business side?\n\nZero concern. Yeah. I mean I do I do hear about the stories of founder strife and I have my like you know so many gripes around you know working with my brother. It's not always easy. With all that said, the three of us are so aligned in our work ethic and knowing that we're never going anywhere. Um, but not because it's easy, right? You know, there's days where I'm like, is is this worth it? Like, is it worth it trying to build, you know, 200 ice cream stores in the next two and a half years? Um, but with that said, we're completely similar in our um alignment on wanting to grow in our work ethic. And I I imagine that's what would make it hard. You know, if one founder said, you know, I'm going to take six months off and travel the world, which is awesome. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nSure.\n\nBut I think we're fortunate that there we're completely aligned. So there's never been a question of is this person working hard? Does this person want to grow it in this way? I mean, our the problems I have with, you know, co-founders being my brother and Laura are that because we're so close, there's no filter, right? Um, generally the fights, particularly with Peter and I are over I don't like the tone that you took in that email, you know, and it's like, you know, we're really not fighting over the big stuff.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Was it clear early on who would do what in this three-way partnership?\n\nNo. No.\n\nSo, how did you sort that out?\n\nUm, how did we sort that out?\n\nAgain, I don't remember the hard stuff. Um, we kind of all did everything early on. Um, as we grew, I've always been the I never said CEO. I always felt kind of silly saying CEO when we were like a little business with a few trucks. I started calling myself the CEO when I don't know when we hit like a few hundred employees. Before that, there were no titles. Just we're running the business. We're the founders. Um, as we've grown, the responsibilities are delineated. With that said, it's pretty fluid. I mean, we're growing at 30 to 40% a year. So, nothing stays the same. The challenges change every year.\n\nYeah. I mean, 30 to 40% a year off of a pretty good size base now. Um, how big is the business today? So in 2025, we started with 70 corporate-owned scoop shops. We'll open 35 this year. So we'll actually grow 50% on our scoop shop footprint this year. Um wholesale is in 15,000 doors with over 50 SKUs. Um we I think by July we'll hit about 2,000 total team members. Um most of that are in the retail stores. Um, so growing rapidly.\n\nHow did you guys grow off of those two trucks?\n\nBy the second summer, we had six trucks. So from year one to two, you know, we had gone from two trucks to six trucks. Um, and then in the third year, an opportunity to open a brick and mortar rose, which was not part of our plan.\n\nWhy not? Um, we thought we loved the truck model.\n\nYou know, you could get a truck going for $60,000. There was no rent. You could put it wherever you want. As I'm saying this, why would you ever do brick and mortar, right? Trucks sound so much better. You do brick and mortar because they do a lot more revenue and they're a lot easier to operate. And somehow we got this store open, which was one block from where we lived for like $22,000.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt was 96 ft. It was a very small store. But you didn't need much more than that cuz people can line up outside.\n\nExactly. And to us, wow, this is much bigger than a truck, right? Bigger than the 30 square ft.\n\nUm, within three hours, we said we're never building another truck.\n\nReally? Because\n\nthis was Greenpoint, Brooklyn 14, 15 years ago.\n\nOkay. Um, so not nearly as affluent or even residentially dense it is as it is now.\n\nUm, and that store in three hours had already done the revenue that you know our best truck location would do in an entire day.\n\nWhy? What was different about it?\n\nThere's just something different about brick and mortar. Like it I think it looms in the consciousness of the consumer in a bigger way.\n\nAnd so was that the moment where you said we're gonna we're gonna plow into brick and mortar? Was that\n\nwe wanted to plow as much as we could with no outside capital?\n\nOkay.\n\nUm we because you wanted to stay in control of the business or\n\nwe wanted to stay in control. We didn't want to sell equity. I think the other part is like we knew we weren't good enough yet to really scale.\n\nUm we're pretty good, right? Um but had we scaled then you know had in year three someone said here's five million bucks you know which would have been enough to open you know 10, 15 stores those stores would not be the way we want them to be now, right? You wanted to learn more and get better. I I I love this because you know so much of what we talk about with entrepreneurs is you know look you you you jump off a cliff and you build the plane on the way down, right? And and getting started it kind Sounds like that's a little bit of what you were doing. Like we're just going to figure it out.\n\nBut then you took a more measured approach to scale. It was okay. We've got this going. We've got some traction. We clearly have some product market fit, but we want to hone this and get much better at this before we we try to jump on a rocket ship or build a rocket ship. So what there it feels like there are a couple of possible inflection points here, right? One is growing brick and mortar. The other is going into wholesale. And for anyone who's ever looked at the frozen foods market, it's tough, right? I mean, especially ice cream, it's like it's heavy to ship. You you I mean, you're you're you got to keep it frozen. You can't you can't not do that. Um, talk us through how you all evolved. Where where where did you make a leap either on the brick-and-mortar side or on the wholesale side where you were starting to see that this could be a much bigger business?\n\nIt never feels like we took a leap actually.\n\nI mean, it feels like we're taking a leap this year going from 70 to 105 stores in, you know, a single year. Until this year, it was kind of slow and steady. Um, wholesale we did not plan on going into, but our first day in business in New York City, somebody from Whole Foods approached the truck and asked us if we did wholesale. And what we did early on and we still do it to this extent is, you know, we say yes to everything. You know, now it's we say yes to every meeting that might sound interesting. You never know what's going to come of it.\n\nUm, you know, a lot of them end up being a waste of time in hindsight, but, you know, if one out of 30 is the next big deal or the best location you're ever going to open, you should do them. Um, so we said yes to wholesale, but yeah, to what you just pointed out, wholesale is a much harder business. If we didn't have the brick and mortar, I don't know where we'd be cuz that has subsidized the wholesale business many many years. Um, I mean, just looking at my wholesale P&L today, which like will be not surprising to anyone with any literacy around selling frozen CPG products, you know, the margins are absolutely razor thin.\n\nWhy are they so thin? Just help how for folks who haven't been in this.\n\nFulfillment cost. Fulfillment means just moving the product around. um trade spend, which is not unique to ice cream, but ice cream's really competitive. Um, you know, and we're competing primarily not with our direct, you know, small artisanal competitors, even though I think counterintuitively those feel like our biggest competitors, but who has all of the market share? you know the Ben & Jerry's, the Hogands Talente, and they are of course as efficient as you can possibly be from a fulfillment standpoint, from a trade spend standpoint, and from a COG standpoint, right? They're manufacturing as efficiently as possible. Um, so that makes the CPG business, you know, really just a game of scale.\n\nYeah.\n\nRight.\n\nWas there a moment on the Van Leeuwen journey where you thought you might not make it? Never a moment where we thought we wouldn't make it just cuz I'm really optimistic and I knew we could. But plenty of tough moments, you know, where we were about to run out of money. The week before Christmas, maybe gosh, probably only like 10 years ago, um there was no finance team, you know, I did the books and I said, \"Wait a minute, we're going to be negative, you know, $200,000 in a week.\" And I'm like, \"Shit, not a good moment.\"\n\nYeah. Not a good moment. I don't know how we got here, but that's not going to work, right? Um, we did not have any bank relationships. There was no way to borrow money. Somehow through a little bit of Googling, you know, I found a a nice, you know, 34% hard money loan.\n\nWow.\n\nYou know, proved in 24 hours, you know, money was in the bank by Christmas and it saved the day. Um, but yeah, it was super stressful. But even then, because before that, maybe a month or two before that, we had turned down an offer to sell 15% of the business for $250,000. I was not like capital market savvy then, but I was still like, \"Yeah, I don't like that. That doesn't seem like a good idea.\" So, borrowing this money that I knew I could pay back in a year and a half that, you know, would cost me like, I don't know, 100 grand to pay back.\n\nYeah. You know that calculation I was so like this is a lot cheaper.\n\nYeah.\n\nThan having sold that equity. Yeah.\n\nThank God that's what you did.\n\nYeah. So we did that. Yeah. Right. So then\n\n\nYou all sort of famously have not spent heavily on marketing.\nUm, I, I think you didn't spend anything on marketing for years, right?\nUm, and one of the ways you all have built the brand is through some really creative collaborations.\nUm, where did those start and and and what are some of your favorite ones along the way?\nWe sort of fell into learning about how collaborations can help you build brand awareness.\nThe first big collaboration we ever did was Kraft Mac and Cheese.\nUm, it was right as the pandemic was ending and their marketing agency in New York City called us and I was talking to someone there and she said, \"Do you want to do this?\"\nAnd I actually said, \"Absolutely.\"\nI was like, \"This is going to be awesome.\nThis is a no-brainer.\nI, I thought like the juxiposition would be really cool um of this sort of classic American product with this small artisal ice cream also in a shocking way, right?\nIf it was a classic American dessert mass market, it's too obvious, right?\nAnd we're really strict with our um, we call them ingredient guard rails, but it was actually a clean label product, which I didn't know.\nM, um, I don't eat a lot of Kraft Mac and Cheese, but you know, colored with turmeric and anado.\nYou know, it's basically turmeric anado, salt, cultured milk powder, you know, cheese powder.\nUm, and it was really good.\nIt's a really, you know, kind of weird tasting flavor, but still tasty.\nAnd we launched that flavor on our website and within, you know, minutes the website had crashed and, you know, I think within 10 minutes the we didn't make that many initially.\nMaybe we made like 20,000 bites, they'd all sold instantly.\nIt was huge, you know, it got, I think, 12 billion media impressions, whatever that means.\nUm, does it help the brand?\nI actually don't know.\nDid you get a ton of inbound after that from other brands saying, \"We want to do a version of this with you?\"\nWe got a ton of inbound.\nUm, and we actually started partnering in a way with bigger brands um where they would pay us to do flavors.\nUm, and you know, it's kind of a win-win.\nUm, I mean, we're still super selective.\nThe ingredients had to make sense.\nUm, you know, what we learned from it, though, is I'm glad we did it.\nYou know, we'll continue to be open to crazy collaborations like that.\nBut it's not core to us.\nUm, you know, New York Times last year, wire cutter blind taste testing, which I was saying I'm against, called Van Leeuwen Vanilla the best vanilla ice cream in the country.\nUm, that made us really happy.\nI, I understand that the sort of gimmicky media-driven ideas aren't necessarily the ones that like you're excited about, want to do, but can I throw a couple brands at you and see what what what just off the top of your head?\nYeah, absolutely.\nUm, if if if Spirit Airlines came to you and said, \"We want to do a collab.\"\nWhat, what are you immediately pitching Spirit Airlines as as the flavor you want to do with them?\nOh my god.\nWhat am I immediately pitching to Spirit Airlines as the flavor I want to do with them?\nI mean, I would do something that would be sort of artisal and middle American.\nSo, like smoked hay ice cream.\nOh, yeah.\nCuz you get the yellow in there with the Spirit logo.\nYeah, exactly.\nOkay.\nUm, uh, different spirits.\nSpirit Halloween.\nThe obvious would be like a pumpkin ice cream colored with more turmeric and then a charcoal ice cream which we've done.\nSo this orange and black.\nUm, I guess the less the less obvious we would do like a butterfly pea flour ube, you know, really purple ice cream swirled with a um bitter dandelion green ice cream that we add more um chlorophyll to to make it bright green.\nSo you have like green and purple like good sort of Yeah.\nOkay, last one.\nLinkedIn.\nOh, LinkedIn.\nLinkedIn ice cream.\nSo something really boring.\nWhat's cardboard made of?\nYeah.\nI mean, sure, why not?\nYeah, that's it.\nOkay.\nI love it.\nIf we were sitting down a few years from now, what do you imagine the conversation we're having about where the business has gone between, let's say, 2025 and 2028, 29, 30?\nWhat's what's the growth trajectory you're hoping to achieve?\nUm, two, three years from now we, I, I anticipate we'll be at around 200 stores.\nUm, we hope there'll be a lot of international presence then too through.\nAre you international right now or not yet?\nNot yet.\nWe do have one location in Singapore.\nUm, that was our little franchise test.\nUm, and I mean what what excites me most just from a this is what I enjoy doing, this is fun standpoint, yeah, is innovation, you know.\nSo, I hope we'll have even more new flavors um that are really popular and more innovations even beyond flavors.\nSo, different kinds of product offerings in the scoop shops always that incorporate um ice cream, but we're opening, which I'm very excited for, the Van Leeuwen flavor lab.\nWhat's that?\nThe flavor lab is an innovation kitchen where our entire innovation team will work out of um and a tasting room and then in the front is an ice cream shop and everything's separated by these cool retractable glass walls.\nYou see through the entire space.\nSo all of the innovation now will happen at the point of sale where our guests come in.\nUm, not just for show, but what we realized was like getting the not only getting immediate feedback, you know, making a new flavor and saying, \"Let's put it out there and see what people think.\"\nBut there's something about making the products where you're serving the products that just, you know, for me like cultivates better ideas, more excitement, brings out people's passion more.\nSo, I think we'll be even more successful at innovating out of that space.\nBen, thank you for being on Masters of Scale.\nThanks for having me.\nAfter spending time with Ben Van Leeuwen, it's clear why the company has been such a success.\nTheir humble, hardworking mindset allows them to balance high-quality products with innovative brand growth and a slow and steady approach to scale.\nAlso, the ice cream is undeniably delicious.\nIf you haven't had the chocolate caramel cheesecake, you have no idea what you're missing.\nI'm Jeff Berman.\nThank you for listening.\n[Music]\n",
