  "cleanText": "Playing one hour a game, especially something as CATAN, makes you get to know that person much more than endless hours of just conversing.\nIt brings out the real nature normally.\nYeah, totally.\nYeah.\nThis week on Masters of Scale, I talk with Ben and Guido Teuber, their brothers who grew up playing the hit board game CATAN because 30 years ago, their father, Klaus Teuber, invented it.\nNow, the brothers run the business of CATAN with more than 45 million games sold worldwide.\nWe'll talk about why I think this game, where players pretend to develop an island by gathering resources, building roads, and forming trading alliances, is the best board game for entrepreneurs.\nThe publishing company was so overwhelmed because they got all of these orders.\nUh, they thought it was an April Fool's kind of uh joke too late in the year when they got these orders and then the retailer said, \"No, no, we mean it.\nWe we we want that order.\"\nWhat we then didn't anticipate was the global success uh that it is now 30 years later.\nI'm Reid Hoffman, your host.\nBen and Guido's father, Klaus, invented the board game, originally called Settlers of CATAN, when the boys were young.\nThey've spent a lifetime in the family business of scaling the game and its philosophy of succeeding through strategic collaboration.\nPlayers compete to cultivate an island, farming, mining, and expanding their territory.\nBut to do so, they need to trade strategically and build alliances.\nI think we could all use more practice with that in our lives and businesses.\nThis is Masters of Scale.\nSo, Ben Guido, welcome to Masters of Scale.\nI've been looking forward to this for a number of years.\nUm, as you both know, I am a huge fan of Settlers.\nUm, you know, probably first coming to your attention with the Wall Street Journal story, front page story about how much I like Settlers.\nUm, which I thought was rather amusing, but I was perfectly happy given how much, um, I like what you guys do.\nAnd so, um, you know, why don't we start with kind of what your earliest memories of the game were?\nWell, first of all, um, thanks so much for, uh, having us here.\nIt's an absolute pleasure.\nWe've been looking forward to this for a very long time.\nUh, my first memory with CATAN is, um, I think one of the first prototypes must have been '93 and it was handcrafted.\nYou know, the game was released in '95, so it was handcrafted uh by our dad and he hand painted it.\nI do remember wanting to collect these resources, not want to give them away, but they were so nice and yeah, a very, very vivid memory.\nYeah.\nAnd then for me, there's one picture that we have and it shows uh me with full hair, long full hair, unimaginable now, and it's in a ski hut in Austria and it's uh Benny, um, my dad, and we had a family around and it was uh we we the the prototype was on the table at a stage where I think it was nearly finished and that that is though something that's the most memorable before it was published.\nSo, one of the things I'm curious about is how did it play a role in your family dynamic?\nBecause, you know, at least my experience playing Settlers, and I don't know how universal this is, but one of the classic parts of of of negotiation is like, \"No, no, no, don't trade with Tom, you know, Tom's closer to winning or or Tom betrayed you on the last one or or you know, that kind of.\"\nAnd I I'm curious, you know, obviously because it's a family business, how did settlers play a role at like the the the at the the dining table or the l the living room table and and the evolution of the family dynamic?\nI wanted to win for sure.\nUh, you know, it's one of the values that you have when growing up with a board game uh inventor as a dad that you also start to lose learning very early, but back then I wanted to win and I was very ambitious and I I do know that it were tough, tough fights uh who will win and it's a running gag in the family where we have the saying, Benny always wins, and it's nearly true, Benny, you do win a lot, and it was always a a fun little rivalry, especially between you and and our dad.\nAnd I have to say, for me, bringing CATAN over to the United States in '97, it was quite a different cultural experience, the way people play CATAN in in Germany versus the United States.\nAnd I think it's uh people take the kid gloves off here in the United States more.\nCan you go into any more depth on what you found um in the kind of the the the cultural parallels and dissimilarities between the the the kind of the US gameplay and the and the German gameplay?\nIf you ask our dad, um, he would have answered something in the in the interviews like uh, you know, CATAN is it's a cooperative, almost cooperative game in the end.\nYou'll still have constructed something.\nIt's it's win-win.\nAnd it's like, you know, even if you don't lose, you still have eight victory points, beautiful settlements.\nAnd then in the comments, in the US comments, you could read, well, clearly he doesn't know what game he created.\nHe should come to the US and play with us because that's not how we play it here.\nAnd that was funny for us to uh because we really believe that.\nAnd um it seems there are different opinions.\nAnd if you go to the World Championships and you have the 60 national champions competing, um you'll you'll discover a lot of different play styles.\nSo, you know, I don't know how many people um uh you know, who are listening to this have actually played.\nI highly recommend it.\nIt's one of the reasons why I'm here talking to you guys.\nUm, but precy of what Settlers of CATAN is.\nYou have an island.\nIt's uninhabited.\nYou build settlements.\nYou build cities and and roads.\nAnd the more you build, the more resources you gather.\nYou trade those resources with your um opponents or fellow players, uh depending on where you come from and what's your cultural experience, if they're more like enemies or or uh you know, fellow players, and then um you'll build with the resources and the more you build, the more likely you're uh reaching 10 victory points first and win the game.\nSo part of the thing, the the way that I got, you know, kind of so hooked was that I thought it was the and still think it is the best game that mirrors a bunch of things that are more true about like entrepreneurship.\nAnd it's partially because you have partial knowledge of the common set.\nI mean, maybe you've been tracking exactly what resources are in the hands, but even then that can trade out with a robber, you know, grabbing one or other kinds of things.\nUm, you have collaboration, which is an essential thing in addition to competition.\nAnd then there were some really unique elements that I'd never seen before, like the tiles, you know, being randomly put out.\nYou never play on the same board twice.\nWe've been very lucky to have had such a great start in Germany, but in the United States, it was really a challenge to explain to people because you have to play.\nI mean, even if you're super excited about explaining it, you have these resources and you trade them and then once you've traded, then you can build stuff and then a lot of people would have fallen asleep by the time you've gotten to build stuff and but when you play it and explain it to someone and you see it in action and you immediately see the dopamine hit uh when when people started trading and all of a sudden it's so important to have the ore and you know why does no one want your sheep and and so it's it's really fun to experience experience and it's just one of those you just have to experience and you can't really explain it that recipe of our family in terms of personalities and how that plays out.\nHow may that inform the development may have informed the development of of CATAN?\nRight.\nOur family, it was interesting.\nWe have definitely uh different representation from the the sort of the the planners, the the combative ones, the diplomats, uh the the ones who sort of kind of our dad was often in the situation where he played the game, but then also uh checked out like how everyone reacted and and what sort of the the vibe was and he was thinking at the same time while he was moving the pieces, he was thinking about, well, could this be optimized.\nSo there was always like something in the back of his mind uh that this machine that was um playing and and where he he played the game and then also kind of developed or or tweaked it in his mind as we were playing and uh I yeah, I I won't say who did what, but for instance, uh it's also like sometimes it's you are different when you play a game uh versus how you are in life.\nSo uh in in my case, for instance, I see myself bit more of someone a bridge builder, someone who's a diplomat, and yet my mom has commented often that why are you so ruthless in this game?\nI don't even I don't even recognize who you are.\nIt's like who are you?\nShe she said that in one game.\nThat's true.\nWell and this is actually one of the things that I find, you know, kind of amusing because it's like for example, a common uh trait in games that I'm playing.\nSo like for example of Ben, you and I were playing a lot that with the people I play with, they say, oh, Ben wins all the time, don't trade with him, trade with me, right?\nLike there's a whole kind of psychological even the kind of the multi-game player side that goes to it, which is among the many things that I love about kind of where the game has more of an entrepreneurial texture or kind of a real world texture because it it it plays into all of those dynamics.\nI think um playing one hour a game, especially something as CATAN where you have the social skills also um makes you get to know that person much more than endless hours of just conversing because you can you know, represent anyone, but uh playing actually brings out I know this doesn't speak to your earlier example, but it brings out the real nature normally.\nYeah, totally.\nYeah.\nSo, when did each of you get formally involved in the family business and um and how did that, you know, how did that come about?\nAnd I guess Ben, we'll start with you.\nUm, so I um I studied psychology and then I studied management and I loved both worlds growing up and um I never really really intended to join the family business.\nIt was very open and since our dad was a little bit forced by his dad into his business, he was like, do you guys do whatever you want and you know, Guido was in the company already uh by then.\nUm, and I I felt like this would be wonderful to work with a family and I sometimes compare it to, you know, like an additional family member because it's it's you know, now 30 years, I'm 40.\nSo, um, it's it's it's such a long time in our lifespan and at some point it was just uh like um this is this is right now because it it contains my love for psychology and as well for management to to have this this company and kind of feels like a startup still uh somehow to us because we we make so many new things every time every year and um yeah, at some point I was just convinced that this is right and then I entered the family business and um actually haven't regretted one day.\nI love waking up going to work.\nYeah, for me it was a a similar experience in the sense that it kind of extended from childhood to uh the teenager years just being around games and the family uh into bringing the game with me uh to the United States.\nUh, it had been published in 1996 by Mayfair Games and then I immigrated to the United States.\nUh, first uh was here studying international relations and always wanted to do that something in that arena, um, diplomacy, and I had a chat with my dad and at that time he said, hey, um, kind of looks like CATAN is here to stay, there's different publishers in different countries and they're interested in the license and I really need someone who can coordinate and manage the um the the the sort of everything, the the business part of that.\nAnd so I was still in my in in graduate school, but I said like it something uh went off and I was like, \"Oh, this is actually this is diplomacy.\nThis is uh international relations kind of just with the uh publishers.\nI love the game.\"\nAnd it was a um connection to my dad, to the family.\nSo I said like, why don't we try it out?\nI I would love to do it.\nI always liken CATAN as a passport.\nIt was my personal passport.\nI could whenever have the game with me and I knew other people were playing it at conventions or in in board game cafes and so on.\nIt was really cool to connect to people that when you were immediately part of a community and at the same time it was also connection back a bridge to to Germany.\nSo um I also uh never regretted it and it it fulfills me.\nEvery morning I I wake up, I I just you know, have to pinch myself and say this is really sort of a continued uh dream.\nUm, I'm living and we're living and now Benny and I can stay connected uh that way.\nUm, and then it just like it does uh it's it's so great to have the the business that also then keeps us personally super close across the Atlantic Ocean.\nWhen did your dad first realize that this was going to be a success?\nSure.\nYeah.\nUh, I remember when it it just right out of the gate it was super successful in Germany and there were several reasons for it.\nWe we always figured, well, this game would be very successful among game enthusiasts.\nAnd the publishing company was so overwhelmed because they got all of these orders.\nUh, they thought it was an April Fool's kind of uh joke too late in the year when they got these orders.\nAnd then the retailers said, \"No, no, we mean it.\nWe we we want that order.\"\nAnd you know, now we're with like 45 million copies.\nWe we would never expected um anything like this to happen.\nUh, back then, of course, Reed, we per we sometimes personally hold you responsible.\nI don't think there's any interview when they ask us about, you know, like the success in the US where your name doesn't come up because basically you I think you introduced it in meetings and you said, you know, I play it with sea level job interviews because I want to get to know them and that is just so much the the soul of the game and and and what we talked about earlier.\nSo I guess it started from there and then kind of like went all across just the cultural um aspects that you like to to to sports people to actors um everywhere.\nSo yeah, that was that was quite um surprising for us how that developed.\nSo what are some of the biggest challenges um that the company has faced in scaling, you know, has been licensing, marketing, manufacturing?\nFor me, the most cutting and um scary one was piracy.\nUh, and and that was in 2017.\nSo, and we we had a\n\n\nMayfair Games was a great steward. They brought up the game. They brought it through the ranks as you said, like they were in colleges. Their marketing was basically from going from event to event, Gen Con and other game events, and just demoing one game at a time. That strategy went really well.\n\nThen in 2017, something strange happened on Amazon, seeing the ratings for CATAN plummet, where we usually were sort of miffed if we got a four-star rating. It was like, \"Oh, what did we do wrong?\" We really have the aspiration to have five-star ratings because we really want to offer a premium game to players. What's with these one stars? It turned out that piracy was the culprit, and there were massive waves of piracy originating mostly from China, then just coming in container loads. At some point, every fourth or fifth game was actually a pirated copy from China. So that was, and so it took us two years to sort it out. It was really, yeah, that was for me personally the biggest scare and something that set us back for a little bit. We've recovered from it, and it's sort of an forever problem, but it's something that's manageable.\n\nYeah, I think that was one of the biggest threads. One of the biggest challenges was maybe the organic growth. You know, as just mentioned in '95, we didn't expect this game to grow as much, and CATAN grew constantly. So it was the first time that we experienced something like that, and more countries came and wanted to publish CATAN. One of the reasons why we took away Settlers of CATAN is that there are declinations in different languages. So in some languages, I think in Czech, it needed to be called Katanu, and in French, they added an \"e\" so that the pronunciation is Katan. Otherwise, it would have been Kon. But they were like, \"Well, you know, we can do what we want.\" So like bringing all this back together has been a really big challenge. We have now 44 languages. It's a constant learning curve, but that challenge was really a remarkable one.\n\nWell, that reminds me, congrats on the 30th anniversary of the game and the new sixth edition.\n\nThere's a ton of expansions, right? So there's, you know, there's Seafarers, there's Cities & Knights, there's some branded ones, you know, like Star Trek. How much of it was a strategy? How much is what people coming to you? What have been the learnings of the kind of the breadth of how CATAN has expanded?\n\nI would say just in general, we're very selective, and we take great care to vet everything. So for CATAN, just in very general terms, we make sure that when we license something or even approach the idea, that it has to be a good fit, right? So for example, Game of Thrones and CATAN, on the face of it, that is not an obvious fit, right? But we found, actually, as a team, this small area and in the Venn diagram where you had an overlap, and then we looked at that, and then it was really intriguing. So there is really great care, and I would say it's always important to offer something, not just a reskin of something with a particular topic, but then to add something that's really unique. I think that segways well into more the design corner of the company, Benny, which is something that you have taken on. So, but I think in very general terms, it's really something where we excruciatingly carefully measure and vet and think and ponder whether it would be a right fit. If it's not, then we've said no to a lot of interested parties. Even on the face of it, if it seemed attractive or it's a great brand or IP, we did say no a lot. In some cases, it really feels sad, but then you did the right thing because it has to be an organic fit with CATAN.\n\nYeah. And I could show you, I'm not sure if it's dozens of boxes, but a lot of boxes of games who have not made it to the shelf because for multiple reasons, as Guido just said, maybe the fit for the brand wasn't right. You know, there's too much maybe like winning through war. You can't imagine how many expansion suggestions we have received. Why don't we introduce soldiers and nuclear weapons and, yeah, it's soldiers and tanks, and it's like, \"No, that's not the philosophy of CATAN.\" So that's one, like the brand fit.\n\nWhich expansion gets most used, and are there any lessons from that?\n\nMy personal favorite lately is CATAN Connect. It's a relaunch of 2015's CATAN Big Game. We've been making a world record with most people playing CATAN in the same time, the same game. So, we have had a thousand people on long benches, and there's one dice roll, and everybody plays the same turn. You have 30 seconds, and you're like screaming around, like, \"Who can trade?\" And it's very hectic. You're like screaming at your neighbors, friendly screaming, and you can be the winner of a game which is as big as a thousand people. So this year, we'll do another world record in the game fair of Essen in Germany. We want to have 1,200 people in a much bigger hall. I've been playing this game in the last weeks and months so much that I have to say it's my absolute favorite at the moment because that mode is so fun.\n\nYeah, I think that is really has the feeling of a party, and whether it's in a smaller circle with, let's say, 12 or 18 people, or you know, thousands, it's just always like it feels like a mixture of going to a sports event and a concert and playing a board game, kind of like in that kind of overlap in the Venn diagram. I have to say, so for me, the most exciting new variant or standalone game is New Energies, actually, and that was actually, Benny, you are, this is really, you can claim that that's your design, and that has been great.\n\nI went to The Verge in November. It was here in San Jose. Reid, and it kind of, you know, the environmental conventions, they are very focused on sort of, obviously, serious and important topics, but sometimes it's nice to have an icebreaker. So we had a little room where we basically introduced New Energies, and policy makers, people from logistics companies, people who were in the environmental field, they were super interested, and it was actually a lot of fun and also at the same time educational. We had some guest speakers, and it was really awesome to see a bridge of something where games can literally help to break the ice, and then you had, just, it was wonderful. We learned a lot from that experience, just about renewable energy. So maybe Ben, this is the right question for you because I did mean to ask. I mean, what was the inspiration? What has the response been to New Energy? The climate CATAN is obviously very, you know, kind of timely in terms of important issues in society. So what was the inspiration, and what have been the learnings so far?\n\nWe had a little scenario called the Oil Springs. It was sent in by a guy called Eric Aaduran. He was, you know, part of Worldwatch, like environmental society, and this is a free little scenario now, which we actually still offer for free download. But we can make a game of this because it's fascinating, and 2015 kind of feels like a different world somehow. But, you know, we started, and well, you know, we are not scientists. We know very little about it, and I didn't want to make a game where just based on assumptions that I got from reading the news and then maybe a little bit of scientific stuff. So I called up Eric Asadoran again, and I asked him if he could be my, you know, scientific advisor, and it slowly became really round, and therefore I really like that game particularly well, too.\n\nI have a copy. I've played it a few times. I've been meaning to play it more. I've been kind of busy starting some AI companies, but the what's been the response so far?\n\nI have to say, one of the most beautiful things that I saw was when I scrolled through my LinkedIn page, and then I saw Bill Gates playing it. I was like, \"Well, this is insane.\" But of course, we were thinking about, will there be critical voices as well? That was one of the reasons why we did ask Eric to make the scientific check, like, \"Does this make sense?\" And in the same time, from a game design perspective, it was really important to our dad and me that we didn't just make a dream world where the only way of winning will be green. But we wanted to depict it very realistic. So there is also a way of winning only by fossil power, but that only works if you're the only one, and the other players all play green, and they don't stop you. So that is all those dynamics are scenarios of our reality, really. I think that it is so realistic, and that people are, what game did you create there? Like, I won with 10 points by building all those fossil power plants. And I was like, \"Yeah, but like, how did the players react?\" That discussion almost always emerges after the game, right? Like, \"Well, did you play dirty, or why did you play focusing only on renewable energies?\" Then it's what's really fascinating is that speaking with a lot of policy makers at The Verge who were playing, and they were saying, \"Oh man, this game really shows that often it is sort of in that messy middle, right? Like, you want to play on a renewable strategy track, but it's so expensive initially.\" So the beautiful thing is I feel that it's educational without the wagging finger, and that people volunteer, and there's almost an eagerness, a motivation to discuss this topic after the game.\n\nWhat do you guys see as the road ahead, the journey of where CATAN is going, where the company is going? I think a friend of ours, and happens to be the head of CATAN Studio in the US, always said and keeps saying, \"We're just getting started.\" You know, it's been like one of those sayings now, which is still sad because even after 30 years, there are so many new things that we continue doing, like this world record thing, like it's a big event. At the end of June, we have a different one where the whole world plays CATAN in 35 different nations. So it starts, I think, in the US, then we go to Europe, then we go to Asia, and there will be a 24-hour live stream. So that is something new. It still feels very much like a startup. There are so many more ways of telling that story and so many more experiences we can create.\n\nYeah, Benny, beautifully said. I think something that resonated with me that you just said with the to be sort of like a startup and to have that ethos or that emotion and that feeling, I think that's that keeps it fresh, and whether it's among three or four players or an indefinite number of players in CATAN Connect, that is the, that is something that I am also very excited to continue building, just anything that Benny, as you said, also it has to be harvesting, trading, building, and then that's sort of the core loop, but it is a fantastic vehicle to build community. It's almost like hard to keep up and to explore all the fantastic opportunities that there are to express the brand.\n\nI'm going to remember to ask Bill Gates if he wants to play New Energy with me since I see him every so often. Go Ben, it's been a great pleasure. I look forward to playing CATAN with you at some point in person.\n\nThat would be an absolute pleasure anytime. Thank you for having us.\n\nThank you so much, Reid. It was wonderful. Yes, we'd love to play a game with you.\n\nIt was such a treat to talk with Ben and Guido about one of my favorite games. The way they're shepherding the brand first built by their father into the future is fascinating to watch. CATAN truly is one of the best ways to get you into the problem-solving mindset that entrepreneurship requires. I hope you find a board and some friends and get all the games lumber, ore, wheat, and brick you need to build something great while playing together.\n[Music]\n",
