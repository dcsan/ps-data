  "cleanText": "We're having a lot of conversations with leagues and teams and athletes. Um, I know this from my last role that there's a lot of stress and questions around how do people under 25 consume sports? Do they not like sports? Like that's if you look at the data at a very surface level, your interpretation would be kids don't like sports anymore. Because the when you go dive into the ratings for lively sports, you see a decline under the age of 25 has fallen off a cliff. I don't have a playbook, right? So, I'm very open with my team that like I've never done this before. I'm a first-time CEO and no, I haven't built a creator brand into a media powerhouse because it's never happened. We're the first company going through this. We think there's a lot of interest in actually experiencing the Does that mean I'm coming to a Dude Perfect theme park someday? Uh, I I describe the theme park as our north star. This week on *Masters of Scale*, Dude Perfect CEO Andrew Yaffe reveals how five friends shooting trickshot videos has turned into the very model of a modern major media empire.\n\nThis is *Masters of Scale*.\n\nAndrew, welcome to *Masters of Scale*.\n\nThanks so much for having me. I have been really looking forward to this conversation. Um, for the handful of folks in our audience who do not know what Dude Perfect is, what is Dude Perfect? Dude Perfect was originally five friends uh in their backyard at Texas A&M who started making funny videos uh usually something to do with sports and trick shots. Uh now 16 years later we're the largest sports count on YouTube. We have 61 million subscribers. It's not a small number. No, I uh it's funny. I before this I was at the NBA and we had uh about 20 million YouTube subscribers when I was there. By far the biggest of the American sports leagues, right? I would everywhere I would go I'd say I have the biggest sports account on YouTube. Uh and now I it turns out I was lying and much larger 3x bigger. Yeah. Um but but uh what the guys have built is really something much larger than that account. Um we now have close to 150 million followers across all our platforms. We um have products and really meaningful products business, consumer products, consumer products and uh and experiences business as well where people get to really come and um experience the brand. Uh we do a tour every summer. So uh we're about to go on tour later uh in we tip off our tour in July. And what size venues are you doing in this tour? NBA and NHL arenas, 20,000 seat venues. And over the course of this tour, we're going to sell close to a quart of a million tickets uh throughout the US at very very meaningful uh ticket prices, average ticket prices that rival an NBA or an NHL game. Uh and it's a really meaningful business driver for us, but it's also an amazing way for us to engage our fans and our audience. Um and it's, you know, the guys reflect on it. It's amazing that they started as five friends in their backyard as a YouTube channel and now, you know, they've taken this step and it's something so much bigger than that.\n\nYeah. And I think when most people think about YouTube creators, um uh there's like Mr. Beast and kind of everyone else. Um this is really like a a a new version of a big media company, right? With all the different elements of what you might find in a media company. We hope to think so. Uh you know, the guys raised uh a very meaningful amount of money. a reported hund00 million, nine figures uh of capital last year. Uh they brought me in to run the company. I've hired now an executive team and a leadership team and we've really started to staff the team up. I was employed 25. 6 months later, we're at uh over 40 and the goal is to get to close to 70 by the end of 2025. Uh we can do nearly everything that a big media company can do and we're vertically integrated. We've got our own production team, we've got our own editing team, we've got talent, we've got sales, we've got marketing, all inhouse. Whether it's studios, whether it's experiences, whether it's consumer products, whether it's TV, those are all things that little old us in uh Frisco, Texas were able to do. um and able to do it at scale. How do you become CEO of Dude Perfect? How does that how does that happen? Uh you know, so probably started about 10 years ago, I was the head of strategy for the NBA and one of the areas that I saw there was immense growth and immense opportunity was in the content around the game. Um, and so I took over as our head of content, uh, about 5 years ago and oversaw all of our social media, our app, uh, and streaming service programming and our documentaries, films business. And it really gave me insight into how the next generation in particular is consuming content and sports content specifically. Uh and subsequently, you know, saw I also saw that um Dude Perfect raised uh uh quite a bit of money and it piqu my interest and you know, I had actually met the guys at a YouTube brand cast. Uh we both which is the equivalent of upfronts where YouTube presents kind of its it's its advertiser pitch for the year ahead. So I uh I had spoken and they had spoken and Venus Williams had spoken. Um, so, uh, in the green room had gotten to chat with them and really understood that they had a vision to build something really big and meaningful this and were really serious about the business and just really interesting, great guys. Um, so that's where the connection came from. Before we get to you actually coming board as CEO, um, I want to just drill into the NBA for a minute because um, uh, I I led digital at the National Football League. Um, uh, I think popularly people think of the NFL as much bigger than the NBA in the US, but on the digital platforms or the the social first digital platforms certainly and globally, uh, the NBA is is a whole other deal when compared to the NFL. Could you just talk about sort of the mindset at the NBA and, um, what what you were doing there that built the NBA so much bigger than the NFL on these platforms? Yeah, and I can take very little credit for it, but uh you know I think the first thing was an insight that um reaching these international audiences and global audiences matters a lot and Commissioner uh many years ago decided to open the aperture a little bit on what uh rights were available to other creators, what we were going to post ourselves on social and really empowered us to be the first on every platform. We were the first sports league on YouTube, the first sports league on Instagram, the first sports league on Snap. Pick your pick your platform. And it's sort of a challengers mindset, right? It's an insurgent mindset. It is. And you know, I think the other thing is, you know, we recognize how popular basketball is globally and that this is an amazing way when games are on in the middle of the night uh in Europe to reach our audience there and to provide alternatives to the live game, which uh otherwise that audience might not have and they might gravitate toward soccer or another sport that isn't prime time. By the time I left, 80% of NBA consumption on YouTube happened outside the US. uh it it is it is a massive and hu and rapidly growing uh audience and then domestically I think what we saw was it's a totally different audience and there isn't a lot of evidence to suggest that social was cannibalizing in reality the trends were what the trends were and you were seeing you know Major League Baseball took a very different approach in the sort of middle of the last decade and uh didn't allow nearly as much content on social and you weren't seeing youth viewership increase for them. You were actually seeing youth viewership decrease at a faster rate than you were for the NBA. And so my sort of consistent argument was we're actually engaging that audience. And you know, we don't think they're substituting for the live game, but it's making them feel connected to our sport. And if you look at the average audience age of the NBA, which is a decade low younger than the NFL in the US, you know, it's hard to draw a direct line between those two things, but I have to think there's a a pretty strong connection that the availability of and that willingness to engage with, you know, the next generation of fan where they are, where they're naturally consuming content has a lot to do with that. So, you have these experiences and then you meet the Dude Perfect guys at Brandcast. Um, what what happens? Because you're you're kind of in one of the very best jobs in all of sport in America. Most people might say, \"I got it pretty good. I'm not even going to think about leaving this thing.\" Why? Why' you go to Dude Perfect? Um, I did I can confirm I did have it pretty good. Um,\n\nthere are not a lot of opportunities there. You know, I I was in a very fortunate position where there was a lot of interest in NBA content and so people would reach out about opportunities and usually they would be something big and really established or early stage and very risky just on a pure sort of first principles level. There are not a lot of opportunities that are really well established, 16 years of history, consistent growth that are really in day one of their business journey. And from the first conversation, it was very clear that the things required to make this successful are top-notch brand, top-notch talent, capital, and expertise. They had the first three and if I could provide the fourth, there's really a a lot of opportunity for us to build what Dude Perfect is and can be. Um, and so there were very, very few things I was going to leave my role for, but this was one where it had the global brand presence, the um, amazing track record of success, but just so much opportunity to as I saw how creators were going to grow, how YouTube is growing, and the untapped potential that um, we have that I I just think that the sky's is the limit for what we're going to be able to build. Yeah. I mean, agree the sky's is the limit. Want to talk about, you know, the the one real risk factor that I would see in making this jump is these guys have been at it a long time. Yep. They've been doing it their way, right? I'm going to come in here and, you know, I don't want to be the suit who's telling them what to do and how to do what they're doing. Um, how did you get comfortable that this was the right fit and that that risk was a risk worth taking? It is. You're spot on. Uh, and it was something I spent a lot of time thinking about and talking to the guys about. We spent days together sort of just talking through how would you think about this situation? What do you guys really want to like what are the real what are your real goals and aspirations to ensure that we're completely aligned in what we're we're trying to build. Um, and I came away from that incredibly convinced that these guys are committed. uh they're committed for the long term and they want to build a long-term company for the right reasons. Was there a point where you went down there and had sort of the the come to Jesus conversation, the let's let's ask the hard questions? Yeah, I went down. It was uh early in August. Uh if you know anything about Frisco, Texas, it was 108 and 100% humidity. Uh so I wanted to make the conditions as difficult as possible to ensure we were aligned. Um, but I really I sat down with them for uh one I went to a shoot day with them because it's easy to say you're going to behave a certain way or you treat your staff a certain way. I having been around this business for a long time. It's very different. People uh especially on 108 degree days we're shooting outside uh behave very differently when the lights are on. Um, and I wanted to see how they do they talk their talk or do they walk their talk when dealing with their production staff, when coming up with creative ideas. Um, so I spent three or four hours just observing, hanging out, watching how they uh shoot content, how they tweak ideas when something goes wrong, how they adjust on the fly, how they get other staff members involved. um and came away just floored at how um innovative their approach is in the sense that you know they take the best of the creative world but it's really professionalized and that we have a production a full-on production team and a dedicated art team and uh really full scale support. Um and so it's not the five of them and one person with a phone. This is like real production and they treat it in a really serious uh and professional way. Um, so I came away very impressed by that and afterwards sat down with them over a meal and I asked really hard questions. I questions you asked. What are the types of deals that you would and wouldn't do? Would you know is this something that would be over the line for you and tell me why? And you know if I'm here to grow the business, we might have to do things that a year ago we might not have wanted to do. Like how would we think through this? How would we assess that that problem? When you say you want to, you know, the brand is really important. What does that truly mean? Give me more words for what the brand is. Um 5 years from now, what do you guys want to be doing? Do you still want to be doing a tour? Do you you know, how much do you want to be in front of the camera? Do you want to be behind the camera? How involved in the business? Which pieces of the business? We probably spent three or four hours just talking through that. Um and they asked me a lot of questions. I asked them a lot of questions. We talked a lot about life more broadly because this is really, you know, I'm making a a bet on them as people as much as I am them as creators. Uh, and so I wanted them to really know me and who I am and what I stand for and who I wanted to know who they are and and what they stand for. And I can say now, you know, it's almost a a year since that uh sweaty day in in August and they've lived up to everything and I I hope to I hope I have as well. What's the question they asked that you had the hardest time answering? There was a lot of conversation around what type of business we want to build and the guys are very cleareyed and motivated that they want to build something sustainable and long-term. And so they asked me a lot of questions around if a great opportunity comes along in two or three years and we can multiply the business, how do you want to handle that? Um meaning someone wants to buy do perfect, something along those lines. Um Netflix, ESPN, someone says we just want to own the whole\n\n\nThing. And so, we, I think, spent a lot of time just really aligning on what we want to do here is build, you know, something that has content and products and experiences that our kids and grandkids can enjoy. And from our investors to me to them, I think there's total alignment that long-term is the focus. Uh, and they press me on that. I press them on that. And it's really important for me as a first-time CEO. I didn't want to take a role where I was going to come in and spend the first 18 months scrambling to raise funds or, you know, looking to gussy up the company to flip it. Like, that's not interesting to me as a leader. I want to build, and I wanted to build something that will be sustainable, that is a real company. We are, you know, significantly increasing our revenue year-over-year. We're highly profitable. We are a real company, and that's the type of business I wanted to lead. Uh, and I was really impressed, and I clearly, they were uh, happy with how I answered the questions. Um, but it was, you know, we, we uh, we went deep on truly what motivates us and how do we want to align for the long term.\n\nMore with Andrew Yaffe on how to build on the Disney playbook to develop the most intensely loyal fans, expand your brand, and maybe, just maybe, someday launch your own theme park.\n\nI call our main channel, YouTube, the beating heart of the business. That uh, that needs to stay healthy, that needs to stay growing, that is where people find us. Um, but from there, we really spend a lot of time thinking about how do we create businesses that reinforce each other, and that's ultimately what I think Walt, uh, for on a firstname basis, uh, would say, and what differentiated it is, you know, the the 2020's term is a flywheel, but like, that's really what he had, he had drawn, right? It's a virtuous cycle, everything feeds everything else, that a kid who visits Disney World is much more likely to watch a film or watch a TV show and certainly buy an article of clothing. And that's how we think about entering new businesses is not, hey, there's a pot of money over here. It's how do we do something that is truly authentic to our brand that's going to reinforce the love that that 12-year-old boy has for Dude Perfect as a brand. And so, we're not going to go chase, you know, dollars. We're going to say what are long-term sustainable businesses that we can invest in to grow the overall cycle of our business. And that, that's how we approach it.\n\nWhat are you learning from Disney about what they're doing digitally and what should Disney be learning from you?\n\nYou know, if you asked Walt uh, now what he would have wished for in 1957, I think he would have said, \"I'd love to know who is watching my stuff and who is visiting my parks and who is buying my stuff.\" It's way easier to build that at the beginning than it is at the end. Uh, and I think you've seen Disney invest a lot, and they've done a pretty good job in terms of all their data infrastructure and uh, you know, capturing data at the parks and the streaming service and the cruise lines and uh, content and try to integrate, you know, how, how are people who consume Disney Plus, how do we get them to visit the parks, and if someone loves, you know, Lilo and Stitch, get them to the Lelo and Stitch experience. Um, but it's really hard to do that on top of 50 years, 70 years of uh, analog infrastructure. Mhm. So, as we build new initiatives, we're in a very fortunate place that we're starting from scratch and can embed an understanding of who is their audience, what do they want, what experience are they having into the process. Um, and so that's something we're spending a lot of time and some of the capital we raised to to do, which is really understand who our audience is and and what they want. Um, so that's a big thing that we learn from, I think, some of the things they're doing now and some of the things they probably wish they would have done, you know, 50 years ago, uh, when it probably wasn't quite feasible.\n\nIf I were Rob Manfred, who I think is still the commissioner of Major League Baseball, um, uh, um, I think I'd be reaching out to you and being saying like, \"How do we work together so you can make baseball more popular?\" Are you fielding these kinds of calls? Are what do these conversations look like with the big established leagues and and the insurgent leagues that need to to speak differently to these audiences to generate more popularity?\n\nWe are, we're having a lot of conversations with leagues and teams and athletes. Um, I know this from my last role that there's a lot of stress and questions around how do people under 25 consume sports? Do they not like sports? Like, that's if you look at the data at a very surface level, your interpretation would be kids don't like sports anymore because the the when you go dive into the ratings for live sports, you're seeing it decline under the age of 25 has fallen off a cliff. They'd rather watch a favorite creator do commentary on the sport than watch the sport itself. Yes. Uh, and so we get a lot of interest from leagues, teams, athletes to help them reach that audience. So we've worked with um, Steph Curry. We uh, in in October, we worked with him at the beginning of his season. We worked with Caitlyn Clark. We're always happy to have the conversation and take the call and find something cool to do, but our bar is is pretty high, and we have to keep it that high because that's what our audience expects of us. So, we worked with Major League Baseball um, and Sony to help launch MLB The Show, their video game. And for that video, we wanted to put our flare on it. So, we built a a machine that uh could shoot a baseball. It could shoot a baseball a thousand miles an hour, uh, which actually broke the sound barrier. We didn't do that in the video because it was dangerous, but Tyler, uh, one of our guys tried to get a hit off a 200 mph fast ball. Uh, and he did, and it was an amazing relationship because um, MLB and Sony was so had so much fun with it that they ended up putting Paul's 200 mph fastball into the game. Uh, and I thought it was just an amazing example of really awesome partnerships that aren't like, you know, brand deals that where we're doing a, you know, an ad read. It's how do we mutually benefit our audiences and do something really fun that is uniquely us that nobody else would make sense to build a cannon that can fire a baseball a thousand miles an hour and seeing the audience reaction to that, incorporate it back into the game as IP. Um, and so that it's a really cool example of ways that uh, properties and in that case video game uh, wanted to work with us to help promote and reach reach a new audience.\n\nThe team is more than doubling, almost tripling in size when you came on to where you're going. How do you think about maintaining culture where the 22-year-old who you just hired, um, who has that wildly creative next level idea feels as empowered to share it and and and contribute as the person who's been there the, you know, one of the one of one of the guys?\n\nYeah. Um, it's a critical piece for us. I think it honestly starts primarily with recruiting. That is where uh, it is re, it is, it is really hard. We work on it every day, but it's hard to build culture. It is easier to recruit behaviors and recruit values. And so, we spent a lot of time in the interviewing and um, evaluation process looking at, hey, why do you want to come work here? And what is it that motivates you? And talk us through, you know, uh, we have our, like every corporation, a big corporate company, even though we're a small corporate company, came in and put our, you know, defined our values, and they spell out PERFECT. Uh, uh, what are they? Oh, no, no, no, one, the passion, excitement, resilience, faith and family, uh, excellence, competition, and trust. Wow. That's why use that's why you use a mnemonic is to remember it. That's strong. And fun is not the F. I was, I was going to guess that. No, we uh, we left that with excitement. And this is new. It's new. We're a small company that's never really had that corporate flare before. And so, we're learning as we go, um, and seeing what works for us, but it is something that we spend an inordinate amount of time talking about. Especially as our founders, you know, had a conversation with one of them about it this morning that for 16 years, he's interviewed every single person who joined the company. And that's not true anymore. Yeah. And I've interviewed every single person who's joined the company for the last 6 months. That's not going to be true over the next 18 months. And how do we scale the culture? This is when it gets hard. Um, and they've built an amazing culture, and uh, we want to make sure we maintain and evolve it to where it needs to continue to grow and what would make sense for a 70 or 100 person company that might not for a 25 person company. We don't have a playbook, right? So, I'm very open with my team that like, I've never done this before. I'm a first-time CEO, and no, I haven't built a creator brand into a media powerhouse because it's never happened. We're the first company going through this. So, just because I sit up here and say something doesn't mean I'm right. It definitely doesn't mean I'm right because we're all figuring this out together. I would hope that we've hired a team that has more experience than me in a lot of those areas. Otherwise, I've hired poorly. You tell me when I'm wrong. Like, that's I, I want that.\n\nUm, Andrew, when when I, I was at the NFL, like you at the NBA, it's just, it's such a privileged place to work because you can call almost anyone and they want to talk to you uh, just because of where you work. Um, uh, and so when I was at the NFL, um, I I sought out some anthropologists and ethnographers trying to understand fandom. And I'll never forget one of them, um, drew a set of concentric circles and said, \"At the center is your tribe. These are the people who at the NFL literally engage in tribal behavior. Face painting rituals, chanting rituals, indoctrination rituals, feeding rituals, right? I mean, truly. Um, and at the outer circle, the people who just barely see you as they're thumbing by on Instagram or TikTok, whatever it might be. Um, uh, and and the key is to super serve the the that core while you're identifying the funnels that move people most efficiently from those outer circles toward the inner circles. I'm curious when you look at the Dude Perfect um, uh, tribe and audience at the the outer circle level, um, how do you think is that how you think about it, and and what are you trying to to move people from those outer circles into your your most avid fan base?\n\nThat's a great question. I should have called you 10 years ago at the NBA. You would have saved me some work. Um, uh, as an aside, we did a a a similar, we did some some work at the NBA when I was trying to grow our or understand our international fan base when I was running strategy, and we did a focus group of um, teenagers in Mexico, and we asked them to bring their most treasured sports item, their most treasured sports product. And so, I was expecting soccer jerseys of their favorite team and the the, you know, soccer ball or baseball bat from their from, you know, their little league. Uh, four of the kids brought a Space Jam uh, uh, stuffy or doll or or piece of Space Jam memorabilia. And it was this eye-opening moment for me how influential other content is in driving fandom. Um, and it was the exact same question of how do you get people into that outer ring? And it was like, oh, Space Jam, these are, you know, these are Mexican teenagers who weren't alive when Space Jam came out. And yet that is their biggest cultural connection still to sports is an American movie starring Michael Jordan that was made in the mid 90s. Um, and it was it was this eye-opening moment of like, wow, people, we really just need to get people to connect with the sport broadly. That's how you get people into the outer ring. And you're never going to get someone to watch a Tuesday night, you know, regular season game if you don't start there. Um, for us, uh, I do think about it very similarly that and YouTube is an amazing tool for this sort of approach where we do a video with Steph Curry. You're going to reach a whole different audience, and we can see it in the data that the demographic is different, the geography is different, the their interests are different, and um, that is immensely powerful for us to get into the consideration set of, oh wow, these guys create cool stuff. We then have our hardcore fan base uh, who watches both on YouTube, our app comes to our shows, like that is the bottom of the funnel for us. Um, in particular, the shows, uh, and so we are trying to migrate people from social to YouTube, YouTube to to show, get them into sort of a higher uh, LTV area. Y, um, but we're also trying to grow top of the funnel, and that's where I think we do some of the splashier stuff. We're very mindful about balancing both those things and trying to keep the the top of the funnel vibrant.\n\nThe last thing I would say is, um, for a family business, it's it can be more challenging, and this was something I pressed on a lot when I when I started, which is our audience, by definition, ages out. Yep. That uh, you know, and one of the founders said to me, yeah, you know, we have 8 to 14, and then often the kids go on, and they are fans of Barcel or Overtime. And what's funny is now a lot of those people become parents, and they're back. Uh, and they have they have kids again, and they come to the shows, and they come up to the guys or to me and say, you know, I, I started following these guys when I was in college, and it's an amazing circle. We're very intentional about that, and I actually view it as an asset that um, we don't, we're not for mass. We're not going to undermine our brand or the trust that um, comes along with that just to get, you know, 25 to 34 year olds. We have a big, very, very sizable, especially on YouTube, um, audience that is, you know, in the 14 to 34, um, they're probably a little bit more casual. They're not necessarily coming to our show as frequently, but we're not going to become edgy. We're not going to become cool, you know, do the things that other brands do in that just to reach that audience. We don't think that's natural and authentic to us, which is ultimately what our audience loves about us.\n\nYeah. I want you to imagine we are back here five years from now.\n\n\nAnd,\nwhile the intraday intrae may have felt like a roller coaster, the trend line has been really strong, up and to the right.\nWhat's different about the Dude Perfect business that you're telling me about five years down the road?\nUm, five years from now, I think Dude Perfect will be associated with the brand rather than the founders.\nUm, you'll see other IP underneath the Dude Perfect umbrella.\nYou'll see other talent underneath the Dude Perfect umbrella.\nAnd you'll see, um, a number of other products and experiences that don't look like what we're creating today.\nUh, not a small thing to go beyond your original talent, the original dudes, the OGs.\nUm, uh, what does that look like?\nHow do you make decisions, and how do you avoid, um, misstepping with your audience?\nIs that bringing talent on and trying them out first?\nIs that curating them on the app and seeing what the response is?\nWhat, what does that look like?\nIt's a great question, and it's something we spend a lot of time debating.\nUm, I think the, the first answer is, we have a, one of the beauties of digital content is you can test a lot of things.\nSomeone who started as a social media intern and now runs our social media, uh, has become a sort of standin in a number of videos, and the audience loves, loves him.\nAnd to have a, you know, he's 21 or 22, uh, and have that, you know, juxtaposed against our, uh, older guys, uh, and have him be the Gen Z representative is just hilarious, especially given who our audience is.\nUm, and so we're testing a number of folks like that.\nI also think as we launch new verticals, uh, gaming, and we've talked about launching an outdoors channel, you'll see people who are native to those sort of endemic, uh, to those categories, and that's how we'll expand the content umbrella too, so that it's natural.\nAnd then there'll still always be people who are again of our values and our ethos, but, uh, are real experts and are representatives of us in those new areas.\nAnd we know that we're not going to bat a thousand.\nWe're not, we're not going to be perfect.\nUh, but we want to try it and assess, like, but we're getting regular feedback on what's working, and we have so many canvases, whether it's social media or other channels to test on, uh, that we can pretty rapidly get a sense of, you know, who, who might work out well for us.\nWe think there's a lot of interest in actually experiencing the brand.\nDoes that mean I'm coming to a Dude Perfect theme park someday?\nUh, I, I describe the theme park as our north star.\nUh, I think there are a lot of steps on the experiential journey to a theme park.\nUm, but it's, it's very possible.\nSo, uh, those are the sorts of things that I think five years from now, um, we will, uh, we will have delivered for our fans, which is, is very exciting.\nThank you for being with us.\nThank you for having me.\nDude Perfect is such an exceptional example of excelling in extremes.\nTheir ideas are goofy, but the production quality is anything but.\nIt is seriously good, and their work is wildly creative, and increasingly it's data driven.\n16 years in, and it feels like they're just getting started.\nAndrew Yaffe and the team at Dude Perfect are rewriting the rules of the game, and it's very much worth keeping a close eye on all that's coming next.\nI'm Jeff Berman.\nThank you for listening.\n",
