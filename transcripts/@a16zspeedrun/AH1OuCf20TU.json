  "cleanText": "Before Twitch was a billion-dollar empire, it was Justin.tv, a 24/7 live stream of one guy's life.\nNo script, no plan, just a prank-turned-startup built by founders who had just sold a calendar app on eBay.\nThey weren't trying to change the internet.\nThey were trying to survive a pivot from a thousand viewers watching a guy sleep to inventing a platform that reshaped online entertainment.\nAnd then came the phone call that pulled him straight into the heart of the AI apocalypse.\nHe built Twitch to change entertainment.\nNow he's trying to stop AI from ending it.\n\nWhen you think about your journey, right, you start off, it's 2005.\nYou're starting this company.\nIt was a calendaring app or Yeah.\nYep, calendars.\nAnd then and basically you sold that one on eBay, right?\nSo we started it because we saw Gmail and we were like somebody should make a calendar that's like like Gmail but like you know like a JavaScript calendar.\nUm, and it turned out that Google also had that idea.\nUm, we hadn't we I don't know.\nI'm not quite sure we didn't see that one coming to be honest.\nUh, so after Google released it and we realized we didn't have any ideas other than build Google Calendar, uh, we sold we sold it on eBay.\nAn unconventional exit.\nSo then a couple of years go by and you and the guys are trying to think about what to work on next and you land on Justin TV.\nYeah.\nSo the the idea started because we were we were having a discussion as one did for there's about a period about a decade in the you know Silicon Valley tech world where the perennial topic was like what should be done with Yahoo like because it was obviously like this big valuable business with no strategy and so like sort of like people talk about crypto now everyone would always be talking about like what what if you were CEO of Yahoo how would you try to save the company and so we had this conversation about that we're like our conversation version of this is much more interesting than everyone else and so we should like have a podcast or something, but then that seemed like too much work.\nSo, we thought instead we would like live stream ourselves all the time and people would just like want to tune in because we were so interesting.\nIs this really what we thought?\nIt's a the potentially the worst idea, but then Justin was like, I want to just took it one step further to like what if it was just my entire life on video also.\nAnd that was a step too far for me.\nLike which is why it was Justin TV, not Emmett TV because like I wasn't I wasn't uh bold enough or or stupid enough or whatever the combination is to like desire to put my entire life on camera 24/7.\nThat's But you were willing to spend your entire working life to grow, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWhich I mean it's almost like a prank for on your friend, right?\nYes, I will totally spend my time to like build a live live streaming reality TV show about your life where you have to be on camera 24/7.\nSo, so basically the company is now you're telling your parents, \"Hey, I'm going to go do another startup.\nWe're going to make a startup around uh filming Justin.\"\nYeah.\nYeah.\nHow did that go over?\nUm my parents have always had this weird trust that like I don't think they think my ideas are usually generally very good, but they've noticed that like things work out okay.\nSo like Yeah, totally.\nThat sounds good.\nlet us know if you need to move back home.\nAnd so, so then as this thing is, you know, Justin's casting and this is all kind of growing, but at some point you find there's a need to pivot.\nCan you talk about how you sort of found the pivot?\nYeah, so we launched and we it was very exciting for the first uh maybe couple weeks because we were the first people to do a live streaming TV show and so it was this, you know, we got a lot of news coverage.\nThis was on Good Morning America.\nIt was we were we were blowing up and then we had like just no retention and we fairly quickly realized like this was not no not no one we had about a thousand people after all that coverage who were like really into Justin weirdly into Justin watching him sleep into Justin which is like it turns out like it turns out if you put someone's life on the internet 24/7 and you get enough people to check it out some number of people like really attached to it.\nWhat we realized though was that like we just we couldn't produce the content.\nwe were not we weren't very entertaining and so we decided we would pivot to being a tech company and open up the platform for everyone else instead of trying to make entertainment which in retrospect again I'm surprised it didn't really make sense for us to ever try to make the entertainment ourselves but that was a good pivot so we we just we opened up as a platform YouTube but live basically so in terms of sort of talking to users and things like that I think I I think somewhere along the line I I picked up that you said you kind of have to be careful about which users you speak to in the beginning actually what What worked about this is that we were our user.\nLike the reason why Justin TV was successful was we were building something for Justin and using it.\nAnd a lot of our best ideas came as we were building product for ourselves to use to make the show.\nAnd then when we opened that up for other people to use it, like they liked it too because we were we had a good intuitive sense of what someone we had a really good test case for that and we built for that.\nAnd then from there, we kind of tried to like figure out what to do next.\nAnd we'd ask our users like, \"What do they want?\"\nAnd then we go try to build it.\nAnd that really just didn't work at all.\nThe features we built were just never never got used.\nSo So then with Twitch, you had this sort of uh you know, you had essentially a marketplace, right?\nLike you had to attract people to watch these the the casts.\nYeah.\nSo how did you manage the sort of do they have competing interests and wants?\nAnd with Twitch made the really clear decision that like we cared about streamers, not viewers, and that we only cared about viewers exactly to the degree that the streamers did.\nAnd that was important because early on there were only maybe 200 gaming streamers in the world who mattered.\nAnd so it was really it really worked to just focus on them.\nLater on we had to kind of become more balanced, but in the beginning we were very very focused.\nI did a series of sort of interviews maybe 40 50 streamers just talking to people on service offervice.\nWhat became really clear is that uh probably the biggest single take I had from that was people really wanted to make money.\nAnd as someone who' always had a job that like paid like a real salary, I was confused by this because they I was like, \"You're going to make I know how big your channel is.\nYou're going to make $6 a month.\nYou're not going to make like lot a lot of money here.\nIt's not like it's irrelevant.\"\nAnd they're like, \"That would be amazing.\nI would love to make $6 a month.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Ser, seriously?\"\nLike, \"Yeah, totally.\nThat would be great.\nCan I make you know, I'd make four if that's what it took.\"\nAnd I was just like, that was such a surprise.\nLike I I did not expect that answer.\nAnd I I checked it with people and they were like, yeah, they were really excited about making money, even small amounts of money.\nAnd I think that I had misunderstood what that meant to them because what it it turned out that what it meant was to them was like making money streaming meant it was real.\nThey weren't just like some person streaming.\nIf they were making money, they were a professional streamer.\nYou you raised uh money for Justin TV.\nYeah.\nAnd then it became Twitch.\nAnd when it became Twitch, how many employees were there?\nThere were about seven of us.\nSeven.\nWe we we up we gotten up to 24 and we had a realized that we were going to sail our company off the cliff.\nAnd so we had a pretty big layoff.\nAbout half the staff went down to about 12 people.\nThen we spun off three of them.\nI guess we had like nine left.\nSo this is some this is some pretty bold decision- making, right?\nsee you.\nThis was a a hard pivot.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt was it was we kind of had come actually a VC had come to our office um this guy Gideon and he uh he basically talked to us for like you know half an hour.\nI doubt he remembers the conversation and he was basically like you guys aren't growing and the internet not growing is dying so your business is totally [ __ ] Good luck.\nAnd then we left like not quite in those words but like basically that was bas effectively what he said and we kind of looked around and realized he was right that we were running our we were we didn't real like we had been we were in denial about the fact that our business was making some money kind of okay but like not really growing and that we were just we were headed for a cliff and we made some we realized we had to make some really big changes to the business or was not going to be successful.\nyou go you cut down to 79 people and you kind of grew it a little bit.\nI mean you had how many DAU or MAU did you have when you made that?\nJustin TV was at probably like 20 or 30 million MAU when we made the pivot and Twitch was 1% of that.\nNo, more than that.\n2% of that probably.\nSo let's say like you know uh 400,000 MAU.\nWow.\nUh it wasn't called Twitch yet.\nIt was just the Justin TV gaming section, but that's that's how much usage we had of the core use case we were going after.\nSo, it wasn't obvious.\nNo, I mean, it was obvious to me because it was the only content that I liked.\nLike, it wasn't it it wasn't obvious that it was a good business, but it was obvious it was the only business I was actually interested in running because I was tired of working on a product where I didn't actually like my own product.\nAnd I I didn't really enjoy most of the Justin TV content.\nI thought it was kind of boring, but I really liked the Starcraft 2 content.\nAnd so I finally was like a enthusiastic user of my own product.\nSo then so basically the co-founders are together but then you sort of split up at that point or we we spin off social cam.\nMichael goes with that.\nKyle runs Justin TV for me like for about a year while I'm getting Twitch going.\nHe like minds the store with a tiny team of people trying to squeeze as much money out of Justin TV as possible for about a year and then he leaves and starts his own thing which was Cruise.\nAnd then Justin uh stayed around for another I don't know maybe six months or something like that.\nand then uh also left to start his own uh company with his brother actually.\nSo not so not all co-founders make the whole journey.\nYeah.\nI mean we we were all we all made it about 5 years and then and then about 5 years in three of them left.\nUm and we were all much more successful as CEOs of our own things than we had been as CEOs of our individual things.\nSo you know so so 400,000 meu it's 2011 or 12 late 2010 is right when we started on it.\nmid 2011 is when we we when we finished the pivot.\nAnd then when did you sort of realize you had product market fit?\nOh, within within like two months of starting.\nSo like we started October 2010.\nI did around the interviews probably like by January or February it was obvious that we had something really big because we were growing at 30 40% a month.\nYou know like the product market fits a little bit like falling in love like if you have to ask you don't worry you're not it'll be clear.\nDon't worry, it's not it's not a subtle it's not subtle when it when it happens.\nIt's it's very obvious.\nSo you go you go from nine people to within a year we like basically we're within a year we were probably at like 20some basically for every year after that we doubled in size again.\nSo then there's sort of a slowdown that happens as you scale uh in in folks and audience and people employees.\nHow did you sort of manage through that to sort of maintain velocity or did you accept less velocity or the interesting thing is with software is actually you there's a whole set of work we were doing around scaling our video system and that was just for Twitch that probably consumed 70 to 80% of our engineering effort was just like making the product actually work at scale.\nIt maybe wasn't 70% of the engineers, but if you we took all of every every all the best engineers in the company, everyone we could get who was like the most talented engineers, we just put all of that resources into scale the video system because it turned out that like if the video didn't work, it didn't matter how good the rest of our product was.\nAnd the rest of our product was pretty good.\nLike once once you have product market fit, it turns out like usually what you want to focus on is like, oh, you have video, make the video lower latency, make it have fewer skips, make it have it higher quality.\nOh, you have, you know, chat.\nMake the chat product work consistently.\nLike make the moderation tools good.\nYou don't have to invent new things.\nYou you have found a thing that people want.\nNow you have to make all the you just want to make that thing as good as possible in terms of measuring individual output.\nSo if you think about where uh our audience is today, they're all, you know, you've worked at YC, so you kind of get a sense of where they are today.\nIf you could think about three things that you wish you could tell them about scaling and velocity as they, you know, in a couple weeks get their funding, right, and are off to the races, what would you tell them about scaling and hiring and Yeah, I think hiring early when you don't have product market fit, you want to be really cautious because every person you add is like momentum in the direction you're going.\nAnd if the direction you're going might not be right, you don't want too much moment.\nYou want you need some because you have to explore but you want don't want too much because what if you have to change and so you have to be very cautious about adding people and once you find product market fit that equation just like completely shifts when you know where you're going you want as much momentum as you can behind that and that's where you start hiring really rapidly and you have recruiting and you like really really build up energy behind the the direction you're going.\nyou'd rather add a small number of very self-directed the very best people you can find which\n\n\nReally, for you here, and I mean, for most early-stage things, is the the best people you can convince, which is probably not the very best people in the world. Like, if you want to be honest with yourself, like, you don't, you're not offering them the best deal. Startups can't pay them the most cash, and like, most startups fail. And so, like, you, we didn't hire you. The people you're looking for are not the people who have a track record and are proven incredible people. They're people you have to take a chance on because they're taking a chance on you. And so, you're looking for unconventional people where there's some amount of risk involved in hiring them. But some of the people we hired there, some of the best people I've worked with in my career, were people we took a lot of risk on. So when you take the risk and you're, you know, you're small, how much leeway do you afford an employee who maybe isn't obviously off, you know, like, really killing it in their first month or two? I think it really depends on the way in which they're struggling. Um, people who are struggling because they uh, they're producing, but they're producing the wrong stuff. Like, the things they make are like, they don't quite get what to do. Those people are usually, it's like velocity. Like, I don't care if they're pointed the right direction. It's like raw output. If they're putting out a high enough volume of stuff, I can teach them over time to like, make that volume of stuff more useful. But people who are kind of limp and like, not producing that much, just never get enough reps. And also, like, it's just much harder. It's much easier to redirect high-volume output than it is to increase the volume of output. So this is advice that is given out a lot in an accelerator. Um, but I, I think maybe we don't spend enough time talking about how to get the most out of your best people. Yeah. So maybe this would be a good opportunity for you to share some learnings there. I had this employee, Kevin. Um, Kevin Lynn was uh, got hired as our sort of COO type, doing HR and finance and marketing and BD. I sat down with Kevin because I'd never managed him before. I'd been the engine, you know, leading engineering and product, um, and not BD. Uh, I did something with him I'd never really tried before, where I was like, \"Look, Kevin, I don't really understand business development. I don't know what it is, but I know what I need your function to do. I need, I need deals that look like this. Here's two templates for deals, basically. I need as many deals as possible that look like one of these two deals. Can you do that?\" And he was like, \"Well, you want to go over my target list?\" I was like, \"No, I don't know. I don't want to know who you're talking to. I don't, I don't, I don't have, I don't understand what's going on. I don't honestly don't have time. I'm like worried about the video system. So, can you just like go solve this?\" And I got 10 times more out of him than we'd ever gotten out of him at the company from doing that because I uh, I told him what hill we needed to take and I let him figure out how to go do it. There's you requires a lot of trust to do that, and it requires really clearly articulating what you need because it's actually surprisingly hard. It's easy to give people very micro direction. It's hard to really define the goal in a way that they understand it and you understand it, and you're actually aligning where you're going, not just how you're going to get there. But that's like, that's the for getting the most out of your best people. That is always the key is like, you give them direction. You give them like, here's the company's vision. Here's what you own. And then you just like stop telling them what to do. So basically, proactively identify kind of who the athletes are or mathletes in our case, and then just give them something hard to run at. Yeah. And give, give them ownership. Give them, I mean, literal, like, equity ownership, usually, but also like, own part of the company, which is, it's just one of those things. It's like, it's like the, it's like most of this advice, when you say it out loud, it sounds sort of stupid, like, yeah, yeah, give people a thing, let them own it, don't [ __ ] with it, but like, you won't do this, just like, you, you'll fire the people too late. It's just an inevitability of management. It's very, very hard. One of the the through lines at in this program is CEO's job is to not run out of money. Yeah. Uh, what else do you see as the in the job? What else do you see is key to the role? The CEO's job uh, has a lot of aspects to it, but not run out of money is in fact priority one. If you run out of money, you die. So, so that is priority one. Priority two, though, is like uh, almost equally important, is to be the keeper of the vision and just be constantly rearticulating where we're going and why. Um, because that's the, that's a huge part of the job. And not just like where you're going, but getting people excited about, like, inspired about why that's a place that's worth going. And then you're also kind of like the auditor of last resort. There's a lot of making sure as a CEO, um, where you have to make sure that the, make sure this thing is going well, make sure that thing's going well. And then usually most CEOs have like something they're doing where like, there's something that they're just very talented at. And especially early, like, I did a lot of product design, and I just like, I'm good at product design, and I part of the company's success was I was a product manager. It was not a delegatable thing. I had to do that myself. And for some CEOs, that's sales. For some CEOs, that's like engineering. It's usually something that's deeply related to what the company needs to be great at in order to succeed. And I think the hardest part about being the CEO is that all of these things are true. Like, and the, the, the tricky part is not getting sucked into spending all your time making sure when you need to be inspiring or spending all your time trying to make sure you don't run out of money and like, missing the fact that you actually have a business to run and like, uh, I don't know, good luck. It's a hard job. Yeah, it is a hard job, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Any, any advice? How about valuation? What I'd say is one of the common questions we get right now is how do I determine what my valuation is? That's like, it's like a pricing question. Pricing is impossible because sometimes you want to, you raising the price makes you seem more unobtainable. Sometimes you want to lower the price because it's like, that's what gets the deal, gets momentum on the deal. I have never found any universe. It's all, it's all tactics as far as I can tell. The main thing is like, I guess, don't get hung up on the, your first round's valuation is not what makes or breaks your company. Raise the money. Get back to work. All right. Like, yeah, if I, most important thing is like, close the round. Yeah. That's like, that's the only really important thing. So, if you see an opportunity to go close the round, maybe just do that. Fundraising is notorious for being pleasant and easy and fun. So, like, you'll, I'm sure you'll have a great time. So, you, you scale uh, you, you really hyperscale Twitch. Yeah. And then you get to a point where Amazon reaches out, or did they reach out, or how did No, there's this incredible annoying process with like a series of companies, one after another, not starting with a company that isn't Amazon, thinking we're going to sell it and them backing out on the deal, and then thinking that they're going to sell it to someone else and them backing out on the deal. We got backed out on twice in like a six-month period. Uh, which is [ __ ] annoying. Um, and then Amazon actually consummating the deal. Um, which I think turned out to be a good deal for them. That was one of those deals where, like, in retrospect, it's, it was an easy win because when we sold it to Amazon, the share price was $330, and like, three years later, the share price is like $3,000. So, like, it, like, like, since you had to hold Amazon stock, there just wasn't any, there wasn't any way we're going to outperform that uh, independently. So, like, financially, it was just hard to see it as like uh, anything other than a win. I think like, when it comes down to for the business, though, I also like, really am glad we sold to Amazon because Amazon is a very, like, it's a good acquirer. The companies it acquires, it tends to like, actually support them and try to like, make them successful. I promised Emmett that I would ask him a question that nobody else has ever asked him in an interview, and so, and I'm sort of weighing, like, when do I drop this in, so I think it's going to be now. If cars were made out of candy, what kind of car would you drive? So, like, uh, if cars are made out of candy, right, I imagine that the reason they're made out of candy is because people get hungry a lot, and like, you want the most delicious car you can get. So, I think you, you probably want some, some kind of like Reese's Pieces style car because that's like the, the best candy. Is it a convertible or No, because you want more candy. Like, you're missing the whole roof of candy. It's, it's a terrible idea. All right, now we're going to get back to the regular questions. So, uh, so you, you basically, uh, with Twitch is probably one of the greatest, uh, successes of a community partnership in in building out a company. Can you talk about kind of how you cultivated that from the beginning? And yeah, we just, we were just, I made it really clear to the company that our number one value was like the streamers and the streamer success, and then we acted like it. If you believe that, that you care about them and their success and their happiness, and you act like it, they can tell and they'll respond. I actually think community stuff in some ways is like the easiest. It's the most, it's very straightforward. It's not easy. Okay. What's, what's hard is like, actually consistently caring about what other humans were there ever any kind of really hard calls that you had to make. Yeah. I think the the biggest one was like, how much of a rev share do we take? Like, what we had the opportunity, we basically could set whatever terms we wanted, right, because the people didn't really have any alternative, and I think we were quite generous with the revshare, and I think that in retrospect, that was really important because that was the, that was the thing that was drawing people, that was the most painful. We did a lot of other things that were good for them, but they were like, not so painful for us, but giving up significant revshare is like, really painful for us, but good for them, and it really did drive growth for us in a way that was very important. And then were there ever sort of the community demanding things that you thought were a bad idea, or maybe some, you know, parental group comes from the outside and they're demanding that you, you know, take content down. How did you manage that kind of stuff? Like, people are demanding stuff all the time, and you just kind of have to ignore them. Like, unless it gets to the point where like, they have a real threat, in which case you have to deal with it, but like, generally speaking, you just ignore them. I guess you guys started to grow so fast that maybe you just took on all partnerships, or were partnerships a big part of the success of Twitch in the sense of like, streamers, like, getting streamers? Absolutely. I mean, like, branded partnerships or things like that? I mean, from, from a sales perspective, like ads. Yeah. We, we sold a lot of advertising, but no, I wouldn't, I, the big, the big winning partnerships for us were with uh, esports teams who then went and onboarded, like, there were these esports team brands that would onboard dozens of major streamers at once as we'd do deals with them. Not really. Like, I would say that it was, it was very much our us making deals with customers primarily that really drove, that really drove growth. We did deals like Xbox and things like that where we got integration into Xbox, integration into Minecraft. None of that did anything for us. It was like all irrelevant. But at the time, did you imagine it was going to move the needle? Oh yeah. Yeah. We thought we had this very grandio idea that like, we're going to be integrated into all these platforms. It's going to be amazing. It's going to be this, you know, the way Netflix is integrated on every TV. It's totally not true. Like, worthless. So, so for our our startups in the audience, partnership opportunities, but mostly waste of time. Mostly waste of time. Okay. So, so what would the kind of razor be for evaluating the merits of one versus the other? The only partnerships when we did partnership stuff that worked, it was because we had a product that people liked so much that people were coming to us and like, demanding the partnership, demanding the the thing, and we didn't have to do very much work. If it's, if you're doing a lot of work and a lot of selling and a lot of, then it's probably, at least in my experience, probably a waste of time. I'm sure there's an exception to that though. Like these things are, there are no rules in business. It's the jungle and you're just like a Rambo. You sort of like time. Yeah. Yeah. You just got to go in there and like, do stuff. You grow Twitch from nothing to 200 million or so MAU. Yeah. Something like that. And then you sell it for a billion dollars. Yeah. Then you decide to Well, then I worked there for a while because I worked there for a couple years, and then the pandemic hit. Yeah. And that was exciting because Switch, like, doubled in size in like three months, which was like, at that scale, you don't double in size in three months. That was [ __ ] insane. It didn't happen since the very, very beginning. So that, that, that hooked me for another, for another like couple years, three years or so, like, but then I, then I left. Then you left. Then you decide that you're just going to go take this CEO job at OpenAI. Yeah, that was, that was like uh, I got a call at 10 a.m. on on Sunday morning, and I was a little hung over because I'd gone out the night before, and I was like, \"Excuse me, what?\" And I wasn't really following, I don't really follow tech news, so I actually didn't really know what was going on. So then you So then you're wonder So now that so now the the decks are cleared. You can do anything that you\n\n\nWant. You've earned it, and you're...\nYou've started a new company. Yeah. So, I've, uh, I started doing alignment research. Um, we started a little alignment research company, um, because I really believe that alignment is sort of the key to understanding AI and towards building more both more safe systems and more capable ones. Uh, most people think about alignment in terms of aligning an AI to a set of rules, like human values, or like the set of, like, you know, helpful, harmless, honest, or, uh, or to the aligning the AI to, like, do what the user tells it to do. They're not wrong, like that, that those are forms of alignment, but I think that they are fundamentally... God, I sound like a, like a critical theorist, like they're othering. They, like, they, they make the AI this other thing over there that's, that's a tool or a slave, and I think that that's very dangerous, especially as the AI gets more powerful. And I also think, just like when you manage employees, the best employees are not tools you control and slave to your will, but partners who you, you trust and you delegate to, and and who they give you feedback, and it's a, it's a mutual relationship that is actually the most powerful way to interact with another, with another being of any kind. All right, give us the oneliner. Uh, building reinforcement learning simulations to learn the fundamental nature of alignment. And that is the most exciting work I've ever done in my life. Like it, I can't imagine something that is more enlivening for me, and maybe from my point of view, more important for the world. It feels grandiose to to talk about it in some ways, because like I'm actually proposing to go try to solve alignment, which is like [ __ ] insane, because it's one of the hardest problems that everyone's, but like somebody's, if no one does it, we're all [ __ ]. So, so somebody, people better start trying at least. So that's, that's what we're doing. All right. Well, if you don't solve it, we're all [ __ ]. So I'm wishing you a lot of luck. No, there's at least four other people for for edit.\nThere's at least three or four other groups, you know, giving it a try.\nBig fan. Uh, I'm the co-founder of Atori, which is a kind of luxury timu. Luxury Timu, like, like, like luxury dollar store. Yeah. Like it's pretty, it's like incredible. Like, like you have, like the, the highest end cheap shed. Exactly. Hi, I'm Albert from Covered. So we're building the, uh, Robin Hood for personal banking and finance, starting with, uh, letting people bet against your bills. So, um, gambling, more more gambling. It's like the Vegas for everyone. Bring Vegas into your home, into your credit card. Yes. Into your Vegas in your wallet all the time. Yeah. Basically, the, the house always wins. Not, not even when you're buying groceries. Not always.\n",
