I fill the marketing and publishing role on the lovely podcast. Today we have airrestress strategy investing getting in here before Philip takes my spot.\n\nIt's kind of like F1. There's like racing lines, like you got to you got to establish.\n\nUh, fell black monizations are Mitch Katkov, friend of the founders. Let's move on. Jen is in a hurry. We got a lot. We You guys put in a lot. This is awesome. In fact, I didn't even get to do the whole summary, but here's a few things. Mishka has another Supercell rant, and he's begging Supercell to stop the PR so that he can stop talking about them. Please make it stop because Finland's going to kick you out. I just I can't.\n\nThey've already kicked him out. He's already kicked out. He's done. When are you ready in Finland?\n\nAll right. Okay. Xbox Game Pass profitability. Apple EU tears revisited. Oh my god, that's the most confus. I think I need a PhD. That's the most most confusing stuff of all time. Gen Z cuts back on game spending. Merge Games 2 is on fire. There's new news in Forex. Chris has some thoughts about what's going on there. But first, I want to talk about the heat wave that is happening in Europe. Why is it the one time I come over, it's record temperatures in Barcelona, I think I melted, you know, on my tour of Oldtown. What the hell is going on over there? Mishka, Phil doesn't know because he's freezing his ass in the north.\n\nYeah, it's it's pretty hot here in Spain.\n\nBarcelona vacation. Yeah, my wife and I took a little time off.\n\nYou did the whole Vicki Christina thing.\n\nYeah, we food, you know, old buildings.\n\nYeah, Barcelona is really hot at this time. So, if you are in a South European city, you are melting. Like where I'm at, it's a beach town, so it's doesn't matter.\n\nNope.\n\nYou've abandoned your North Europe people.\n\nIt's miserable and cold.\n\nDude, first of all, Kov, dude, have you ever heard of sunscreen? Dude, you look bright red right now. Throw some sunscreen on that bald head of yours, dude. It's crazy. We class Swedish, too. All right.\n\nYou should see my fit. They have these clips on Instagram. There's like a one day in somewhere, one week in somewhere, one month. I'm at the one month point. I had to change my clothes. I look like a drug dealer when I'm wearing my normal. If I'll be here for 3 months, I'll have probably one of those neck tattoos going on. Like, I need to get out of here soon. This place is dealing. Speaking of drug dealing, did you slip a Xanax into Crest's coffee last week? When I listened to the pod, he was the most chill I think I've ever heard. Crest, did you just like turn over this leaf of like I'm not going to yell in the podcast? What happened last week?\n\nI'm pulling it all back, man. I'm pulling it all back.\n\nAll right. It was like, you know, chill crass. I never Something I never thought I would hear on the podcast. Good job, though. I don't have anything to yell at you guys about. Well done, Vishka. You want to yell about something though?\n\nWell, not I don't want to yell about. I just want to chill a little bit then maybe later in the podcast to pick about few of the topics. We had Felicia Co from Play Adventures. She wrote about a cliff that saves a very interesting article. Go and check it out on the blog or on the newsletter. And then I had an interview with former head of Blizzard. They were working on World of Warcraft out of Boston, Seth Civac. He was also the founder of Proletariat. That was a studio that was acquired by Blizzard. Phil has some thoughts about that one, but that's going to be later in the episode. And then for the events, shilling the two parties that we have going on on the 19th, Heroic Gamescom Party with Heroic Labs. That's going to be super massive, fun, and great. Links in the newsletter. And then on the 20th, we're doing third year in a row our whiskey and water tasting event. So the link for that one is coming next week. But those who have signed up to our previous events will get the invite earlier.\n\nAll right. So, this is for Gamescom in August.\n\nAnd it's going to be really, really hot at Gamescom in August, I bet.\n\nYeah. Still debating if I'm going or not. Crest, have you decided? Are you still possible?\n\nOkay.\n\nI I was looking at hotels. The prices are absolutely insane. And then I had this one hotel. I was like, this is pretty cheap. It had bunk beds. So, Phil, what did it say to you?\n\nDo you know those little lower than last year.\n\nLike I just want those little beers again that they serve you. They're so cute. They're so cute.\n\nThe little glass.\n\nThe whole thing with your pork knuckles. Yeah. Got it.\n\nSo, we've been talking a lot about Xbox or like what what for like many months we could call the fall of Microsoft's Xbox Division saga. And there was an interesting post by Christopher Ding. And if you remember, he's the one who launched a podcast recently and he had been at Game Industry Biz beforehand. The podcast was really great. We had talked about it beforehand. I think he's had stellar interviews. Like his one with Tim Sweeney in particular was stellar. He was able to basically stealthily ask, I would say, very insightful questions without Tim kind of like, you know, raising to Defcon 5. And I think this next piece of information he's reporting on was really interesting, which is that he thinks that Game Pass has a positive P&L. And he's now including based on additional information he's got from sources, this idea that there is a an effect on first party sales because of it being on Game Pass, there might be lower first party sales. So even when you account for those lost first party sales, Game Pass is still profitable. And I think that people are taking so many of the wrong takeaways from this because that's not how platform economics work. You don't have these divisional P&Ls and oh [ __ ] yes, we're going there. There's a difference between accounting profit and economic profit. And so you also need to include things like the MTX discount that you might get being on these services. You remember Origin offered something like this. Like those are things that are also lost revenue. And not only that, there's also these free licensing rights which don't always show up on P&Ls. So now Call of Duty can be in Game Pass, which they might not have agreed to if it wasn't a first party studio at this point. And so there's a lot of that that's going on that may not land on a particular P&L. And so you really need to look at like the division over time. And that's where these things do not look good, which is that platform TAM has shrunk. Like that is the most indisputable fact that people need to get their heads around is that Microsoft is selling less hardware and that means less monthly active users and that means they're going to get squeezed in the supply chain which completely changes their position in the gaming market. And if you can't wrap your head around that, I don't think you can understand where Microsoft is right now. And I think that this tweet kind of confuses that and changes the focus from where it should be.\n\nI'm going to keep this really simple, right? You take revenue and you take costs and they're not profitable, right? Like that's why they're doing all these cuts. They're trying to get more profitable and Activision helped them get more profitable because they were a profitable enterprise beforehand. So now you're taking King's profitability and you're adding it right to them. Yep. But they are less profitable. Activision as a company is less profitable under Microsoft as they were by themselves clearly, right? Because now Call of Duty is not selling as well. They're just eating away the profits from the Xbox losses from the stupid game pass. So, I don't even know. I'm sure he's getting pressure from the powers that be to like start restating what he said before, but the fact of the matter is that this is a unprofitable venture and they should just stop [ __ ] Game Pass, right? And I don't know why people there's no reason to mince words about this. It's just [ __ ] to me.\n\nYeah, it sounds like he had internal people saying, \"No, no, no. According to my P&L, it's profitable. It's like, well, it's P&L Voodoo that's going on right now.\n\nYeah. Seriously, like this is why I had this other thing that this Arcane Studio guys came out. His name is Raphael Colantonio, right? He said that it sharply criticized XG Game Pass. It describes as unsubstantiated unsustainable model. It's been damaging the industry for a decade. He argues that Microsoft substantial financial backing masks the true cost and that the service pre pressures developers into deals that they may undermine other business models and that Game Pass could either dominate the market to the detriment of other models or eventually collapse leading to further studio closures which is happening right now. Right? It's like why is this being argued like why are we closing studios is because they're trying to save [ __ ] money. This model sucks balls. Okay, just stop it. It's just hugely bad for the industry. The PR [ __ ] that Microsoft says, you can't believe anything they say.\n\nSo, there you are. There's my crest back this week.\n\nThere you go. 10 minutes in and you're yelling.\n\nSo, I made a huge mistake last week. I was being a little bit lazy, but partly because it just came out. But the changes that Apple are making in response to the DMA are a little bit different than I thought. Right. Basically in essence to keep it as simple as possible they are basically reducing the fee from the 27% that they said before to basically 20%. Right? When you include all the different things that are added up right this does not change at all the 30% that they are going to get from from just using app store specifically right so the changes they are making are only to people that are going off the app store. I do think this is a concession from an Apple perspective in terms of getting to the 20% for offstore payments. Having said that, that is not at all going to impact, you know, the traditional transactions.\n\nSo, yeah, I had a question about this because I was listening last week and I've been reading all of this and man, this is like super confusing. Let me just review. Tier one is a basic app store features for a cheaper 5% commission on inapp purchases. And then tier two is a default tier that everyone gets put into. You have full access to the app store features and it's a 13% commission. And then on top of that was this a new fee called the core technology commission which is 5% commission on outside purchases made in apps distributed on the app store. And then in January of 2026 the core tech commission stays and the core tech fee goes away. the 50 cent or 50 euro cent.\n\nSo, we're also looking at an image that just had tier one and tier two kind of side by side. So, you could see what's included and not included. And by the way, if you're on tier one, I can't imagine anyone would actually do this because you don't get featuring, you're not in the search, you don't have app insights, there are no auto updates. It's like, who on earth would even choose to do that? Can you explain, Chris? So, where'd you get the 20%? Like, I'm It Did you look into it and see that this is I think you just said it only for the apps that allow for outside payments. Is that how you\n\nNo one's going to do tier one, so it's not even worth talking about. So, okay.\n\nThe way I read it is that the external purchase link is a 2% initial acquisition fee. Store services is 13% for the tier 2 and 5% core tech, which equals 20%. So, you're in tier 2 and then that is the fee that you get. Like, if you do the inapp payments, it's still 30% and then if you decide to allow for web shops, that's where you get hit with the 20%.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAll right. Go Apple.\n\nYeah, they're going to challenge it for sure. And and I I think ultimately they're going to capitulate and get to 20% like on everything on everything. But they're not even there yet. But that's my guess. And then Exola and Appch charge and others are going to be in much much tougher cell I think.\n\nWell, if anyone signs up for tier one, please let us know. I'm dying to know anyone who does that. All right, so Mishka, your rant on Supercell. I feel like it's a time warp. And every week I come back, I hear you talking about Supercell.\n\nThis week in games, we cover news. and and you know I really don't want to cover Supercell that much because kind of everything has been said about it but they keep coming in the news and I keep being seduced to cover it. So in the latest one they had Charmmy Kim she was from Space Ape I think she was leading the music game correct Star Nashville Star the\n\nYeah. Well, there's a there's a new version of that, but yeah. So, she was in\n\n\nThis quick interview on mobile gamer\nBiz, and the content of this interview\nwas that Charie is part of the Spark\nprogram, which is Supercell's program\nfor prototypes, and they are furthest in\ndevelopment. Her team has worked with\nthe Supercell AI lab on an NPC AI, but\ndidn't end up using it. And London has\n85 people with most of them coming from\nSpace Ape. That's really the content of\nthis whole long interview. There was\nnothing really. But if you start reading\nthis between the lines, well, Spark is\nin simplicity their prototyping program\nwith people who are not working at\nSupercell coming into this program to\nmake a prototype that will earn them a\njob essentially or they might be other\nway fit to a existing team and they\ncould potentially get a job. So it's\nlike a longer job interview through a\nhackathon essentially. You can also read\nit in a way that why would any company\nuse external people to develop their\nprototypes and then make them new games.\nWell, you can read it that Supercell\nactually is not able to make new games\nwith their existing people and they need\nthe influx of hungry talent that would\nbe able to make them new people. I mean\nthat could work the strategy but what\nworks for sure is acquiring companies\nwith successful titles and Supercell has\nnot done really that before but I'm sure\nthere will be a time in few years where\nthey will turn into this. The\ninteresting part about this article was\nalso the lack of portfolio management\nthere. Essentially, Spark Lab just makes\ncool prototypes that company might not\nhave any type of a genre expertise or\naudience expertise in. And essentially,\nit feels like Supercell has adopted the\nSpace Ape portfolio managementless model\nwhere they just make everything from a\nmobile to a puzzle game to a car game to\nan audio game. And\nthat didn't really work that well with\nfor Space Ape. And actually Supercell\nended up shutting down Space Ape and\nturning into Supercell London. And now\nthey're following the same portfolio\nstrategy essentially that Space Ape had.\nSo it's really weird. And also another\ntakeaway from this article could be that\nthis AI hype that the management is\nhaving is actually derailing some of\nthese young teams because when you read\nthis Tommy tells about how they\nessentially wasted time working with\nSupercell's AI lab because they were\nchasing this NPC AI idea and then they\nstopped working on it because it just\ncreated more problems because they were\nchasing this idea even before having a\ncore loop. And then you start asking\nyourself like how is this team the\nfurthest along in development where they\ndon't even have a core loop for their\ngame which is you know kind of feels\nlike one of the first things you design\nin a free-to-play game. By all accounts\nCharmmy Kim is a fantastic talent and\nthis is more a message for Supercell\ncomms team. In my humble opinion I\nthink it's not good to let interviews\nlike this slide. Doesn't give a very\ngood look for the company or the comms\nteam itself. Even a dummy like myself\ncan kind of read between the lines and\ncome to a conclusion that the company\ndoesn't really have a strategy how to\nmake new games. Seems like they're just\nthrowing spaghetti at the wall and then\nlabs everywhere. Like now there's an AI\nlab and now there's a Spark lab and like\nwe're just trying to come up new things.\nAnd by the way, we don't even have a\ncore loop. And I don't want to throw\nSupercell comms under the bus because I\nknow how the comms work. It can totally\nbe the case where the comms said, \"Hey,\nwe don't want to come out with this\narticle, but they got overruled.\" So\nthat could be also the case. So, not\nthrowing anybody under under the bus,\nbut I want to give Supercell a free\nadvice. So, stop doing PR. That's really\nthe advice here. You know, you had a\nreally good strategy before where you\ndid a lot and talked less and it worked\nlike magic. And it worked like magic for\na lot of other companies. There's Dream\nthat never says anything. They do 10.\nThey did a huge marketing push with the\nnew game. They had all the superstars.\nThere's nobody from Dream given\ninterviews about that. There's nobody\nfrom Moon Active talking about live ops\nand they're absolutely killing it with\nit. And they don't need to. And that's\nthe thing. Supercell doesn't need to do\nPR either. Like you don't have any\nchallenges of hiring new people cuz\nyou're you have a great work life\nbalance culture. You definitely overpay\nor pay really really well to people.\nYou're super profitable company. And\nmost importantly, you are a private\ncompany. Private company does not have\nto do any kind of communication. And I\nthink their annual blog post is\nabsolutely magical. Keep doing that. It\ngives this hope and good feeling to the\nwhole industry. Everybody reads it. It's\nfire. So focus on that and that's it.\nDon't even do stuff about your global\nlaunches. You don't need to take a\nvictory lap every time you release a\ngame. Do these monstrously good games\nand stop doing these interviews and\ntriggering me to analyze how without a\nstrategy you're functioning. So, it\nwould be much better that we could just\nmarvel at your games, marvel at their\nsuccess, wonder why they're down, wonder\nwhy they're up, and just do that one\nblog post a year. And I'll bet it work\nmuch better than these weirdass articles\non all the publications.\nOh my god, I love how you are now like\nyou're truly embracing marketing and\ncomms as your core functionality,\nMishka. Every time I come on the\npodcast, I'm like, wait, you're giving\nlike comm strategy. I love it. So I do\nnot disagree with you that it is our\nbelief that they should be quiet since\nyou personally and by the way us dissect\neverything that they do especially on\nthis podcast. It's my belief that they\nare laying the groundwork for the IPO.\nWe've talked about that since they're\nhiring the CFO. And I don't know, it\nfeels as though those are the\nbreadcrumbs that they're laying down for\nus. And the people that, you know, are\nthe intended target of these comms do\nnot dissect all of this press and they\ndon't really understand it in the way\nthat we do. They just want to be able to\ngo out to the market and say, \"Look at\nall this press we're getting. We're\neverywhere. We're doing these things.\"\nAnd I believe that that's their goal. I\ndon't think it's the right one, you\nknow, to your point because a lot of\nwhat they're talking about doesn't make\nsense to us as game industry insiders,\nbut to the market, they're like, \"Look\nat you. You're doing AI things. Look at\nyou. You have a London things, but\nMishka, stop taking the bait. Finland\nwill boot you out.\" I guess they did.\nUm, so, you know, just like what's going\non in our next story with Gen Z and\nZoomers, those kids are booting people\noff of spending. They do have another\ngame that guys, they actually launched.\nYou know, Moco,\nlike that is now available globally\nwithout an invite. We'll check in on\nthat next week. But like,\nwhoa, there's been no press tour. What's\nWhat's going on?\nGood that they didn't do a press tour on\nthat. Good. Let it grow. Let it grow and\ndon't talk about it. Work on it. Just\ngrow it.\nCan we have a mild agreement to not talk\nabout Supercell for at least a month\nunless there's something crazy?\nUnless they go public. Yeah.\nOkay. All right. So, something I do want\nto talk about is Gen Z. So, these are\nyoung adults that are aged like 18 to\n24. So, remember how we always talk\nabout the video game industry being\nrecession proof? Well, I think this is\nthe first time we're getting some data\nthat is showing signs that that might\nnot be true anymore, especially for the\nyoungest cohort. So, our friend Matt\nPiscatella from Circana and the Wall\nStreet Journal put out an article, and\nthis is just US data. The data is from\nonline and retail sales. I'm unclear if\nthis includes mobile or not. Circana\nsometimes does and sometimes doesn't.\nSo, we're looking at a couple of charts\nthat appeared in that Wall Street\nJournal article in some other places.\nThe first one basically says that young\nzoomers, if I say zoomers, that's Gen Z\nor these 18 to 24s are spending nearly\n25%\nless per week on video games than in\n2024 versus last year, making it the top\ncategory for spending pullback while all\nof the other generations only declined\n5%.\nDude, this is for four weeks ended\nApril, right? April is like the slowest\nmonth of the [ __ ] year for gaming.\nThis whole analysis, I'm really\ndisappointed in this guy because he's\nreally good, the Circana guy. But\nthrowing this [ __ ] out to Wall Street\nJournal is so [ __ ] stupid. Like this\nis the dumbest analysis. Like if\nliterally one game had released in\nApril, like anything almost, and we\nwould have had been a completely\ndifferent story. You know what I mean?\nLike\nOkay. Well, can we look at the second\nchart then? So that that is a little bit\nmore of a longer period of time. So the\nsecond chart we can see that the\npurchases by zoomers plummeted 13% kind\nof where we are in 2025 versus\nmillennials and those are a little bit\nolder. So it looks as though this\nspecific cohort, this youngest cohort\nhas been declining in spending. Does\nthat change your mind at all?\nNo. Yeah. I mean like the problem here\nis like what is this based on? Is this\nsurvey data? Is this credit card panel\ndata? Like the thing is they didn't link\nout to a PDF in the Wall Street Journal\nreport. Like I tried to track it down\nand I went to their blog so I don't\nreally know what I'm looking at here.\nIf GTA first of all this didn't include\nSwitch too, right, which came out last\nmonth. Right. Correct. Correct. If if\nGTA came out in May, this whole report\ncouldn't have been written if they\nincluded May, which they don't. Look, is\nspending patterns of this age group\nchanging? Yes, maybe. But don't like\ncall out video games as some kind of\nlike,\nyou know, canary in the cold mine of\nwhat's to come. It seems like this is\nlike the doom and gloom to an extreme.\nNot sorry. Historically, this guy's been\nreally good. So, I'm not quite sure as\nto why he's doing this kind of hit piece\nfor no reason.\nAll right. Well, let me see if we can\nreach out. I do think on that first\nslide there must be some sort of panel\nor conversation because they did break\ndown the categories that are in decline\nfor this audience. video games was at\nthe top pretty dramatically over the\nother categories that they talk about\nwhich was like accessories or\nentertainment or I do think that you\nknow in the podcast that I listen to and\nthis cohort is having the the hardest\ntime of any of the cohorts and I'll talk\na little bit about that\nyou were saying that you haven't seen it\nfor mobile so this was from a older\ndeconstructor fund blog post cuz this is\ndata AI nowadays sensor tower but this\nbasically shows United States and consu\nconsumer spend growth versus the\ndisposable income growth index. It\nactually shows that as the disposable\nincome goes down postco, we can see that\nthe spend growth declines in games and\nat the same time there's a graph on the\nright that shows that despite disposable\nincome going down, app spending goes up.\nI don't want to get political. I just\nthink that this is a very bad bad bad\nanalysis. Not a reasonable time frame.\nIf you had looked at the full year and\nsaid that this age demo was down\nyear-over-year in a market that's\nbasically flat, then let's talk. But if\nyou're taking April,\nApril, April is like literally the worst\npossible month you could take. Like that\nis the slowest month in the entire year.\nLike April is like one 20th of December,\nright? Probably less. It's a ridiculous\nridiculous ridiculous analysis. So I\nthink he should re check himself.\nAll right. So, you know, I was trying to\ncheck this as well. So, New Zoo as of\nJune 24, so just a couple weeks ago,\nreleased their forecasting for 2025.\nThey're projecting 25 to be up 3.4%\ndriven primarily by console because of\nSwitch 2. Console will be up 5.5%. PC\nwill be up 2.5%. Mobile will be up 2.9%.\nand for the entire game industry, you\nknow, Nuzu is like, okay, well, there's\nstill kind of growth there, you know, in\na sense, North America to be down a\nlittle bit. So, this is from Shrog's\nlatest kind of presentation that he did\nfor us at Off the Record where I don't\nknow if this broke out games or not. I\ndidn't have all the data to like break\nout games in North America, but he has\nNorth America down. So, you know, just\ntrying to think about where he was\ncoming from. Do we think it is\nreasonable to assume that these zoomers,\nthese Gen Z folks are going to other\nsolutions other than premium games? Are\nthey playing more free-to-play on mobile\nand console? Are they going to UGC\nplatforms like Roblox and UEFn which we\nknow Roblox is hitting continues to hit\nkind of record DAU numbers where they\nget gift cards and maybe you know those\ngift cards aren't accounted for or are\nthey turning to your favorite topic\nwhich is Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation\nPlus?\nI was digging around and saw a Reddit\npost and a lot of the zoomers were\nsaying you know I love Game Pass. I use\nit all the time and even though we just\ntalked about it not being the most\nprofitable thing or profitable at all as\nyou always say crest it is you know not\ngreat for Microsoft but it's great for\nconsumers and players. So you know\nwhether you agree or not if it's\ntrending that way are those possible\nreasons why it could be trending that\nway. Again, if we start talking like\nactual real time periods, like\nyear-over-year type stuff, I think it's\nfar better of a comparison. But when\nyou're just pulling out months out of\nyour a-hole, like it doesn't make sense.\nSo, I'm not even going to justify this\nwith any type of analysis because it\ndoesn't make sense. The market is\ngetting concentrated amongst a very\nsmall group of titles and a small group\nof publishers and that's happening for\nconsole and PC and that this is the\nsituation we are in the market. So\nthat's about it, you know, and GTA comes\nout next year and then all metrics look\nbetter, right? You know, hardware sales\nare better, software sales are better,\nyou know, and then everyone's talking\nabout, oh my god, we're back. We're\nback. But, you know, GTA coming out of\nthis year was just not good.\nYeah. There was a hole in the bucket\nbecause everyone was moving out their\nproducts because they didn't want to be\nanywhere near the end of March,\nright? And that may have actually also\ncontributed to the fact that nothing was\nin April. April is the one that bothers\nme the most. It's like April is like\njust a seasonally shitty month like\n\n\nJust fundamentally.\nI mean, besides, you know, June, July, August are not so great either except for Madden and, you know, sports stuff.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nMishka, you want to talk about investment stuff?\nYes.\nPhil had something to say about my interview with former head of Blizzard Boston.\nMishka, I'm I'm exhausted talking about culture.\nI I am I am exhausted.\nThat being said, this is one of your best podcasts in my opinion, and I really encourage people to go out and listen to it.\nTo give you a teaser, like one of the things you guys are willing to talk about is the idea that like low morale doesn't mean poor performance or doesn't mean not hitting the company's goals.\nAnd so like you spend a moment and ponder like whether or not low morale even matters.\nAnd so I thought those were moments that like kept coming up in the podcast, which I thought was awesome, but I also couldn't help but think that there's a difference between what people actually want to talk about when they talk about culture is not culture.\nAnd I think Kim Nordstrom's definition and up down up, which I know everyone read, was that culture is patterns of behavior over time.\nBut I don't think people want to talk about that.\nI think what they want to talk about is institutional policy, right?\nThey want to talk about rules that they can create which ultimately shape a behavior.\nAnd when I kind of look at like revealed preference rather than stated preference, founders spend very little time thinking about organizational design.\nLike they aren't out there thinking about like who should report to who, how should I set up my titling system or not have a titling system.\nLike very little time is spent doing that beyond like I would argue a couple of self-help books.\nAnd I do think like the reason that Netflix is like no rules rules one is because it actually told it like it is, which is that like we play to win and we hire and fire and operate like it.\nAnd ultimately like people understand over time that ultimately action and incentives drive institutional behavior and they just let it rip.\nI think anything less than that is not a sufficient institutional policy.\nBut that's what we should talk about is like policy, not not really cult culture is an outcome of policy or at least it's it's one of the things that we think you're the most important factor and you heard it in the podcast, right?\nLike that's something that he felt that he had misunderstood, which is that you can influence it.\nHe's like, no, you absolutely can.\nI'm equally tired cuz like the success of a company I think it's like a three-legged stool.\nYou got the culture naturally meaning like how people work, but then there's really important part which is capital and then equally important part which is timing.\nAnd every time there's a successful founder or CEO, they just focus on the culture because that's the one where they had the most effect on and then you kind of forget like, oh yeah, yeah, and then we raised, you know, a couple of billion dollars and yeah, it was a perfect timing.\nMarket was going 20% year-over-year and so forth.\nBut I'm really curious to hear what you think about this next investment fell, which is Distinct Possibility Studio raising $30 million funding from Bedcraft for a launch of Reaper Actual, an openw world AAA shooter with web 3 elements.\nIs this Godzilla's off the grid, but instead of a battle royale, you're going open world?\nI don't think Off the Grid got enough credit to be honest with you because I think what it did prove is now that they have EGS, which oh boy, if EGS is the thing you're holding up, you're in deep [ __ ] But at least they have EGS now, which is a mainstream distribution platform for these type of games.\nI still think without Steam, everyone has bowed to Steam and Web 3 will bow eventually, too.\nSo, I think this is really in Gab's hands right now.\nGab Gab game over at at Valve I think really holds the future, but there's been nothing interesting in this space.\nLike we've basically stopped covering it and I think that's for sufficient reason.\nThey haven't given us, you know, something to cover like off the grid.\nYou know, if we want to look at an update, I think it's probably doing fine.\nIs it, you know, a crazy big success?\nNo.\nThey had this weird subscription thing, you know.\nLet's see how much capital they're going to burn by continuing to operate this thing.\nWhy are you doing this?\nI have no idea.\nYeah.\nAnd and it's $30 million in this economy.\nIt's just wasting money.\nWait, they just raised this recently.\nYeah.\n$30 million in a AAA shooter.\nNot to just build, but also\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\nThey've raised 30.5 million to date.\nThis is led by John Smmedley who was really uh big MMO figure early on and also helped set up some internal studios at Amazon Games.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nIt's not no one.\nThere's a track record here.\nLike I think that's the most important thing.\nHis team rather than business model.\nBusiness model can always change.\nMhm.\nAll right.\nWell, on the other news, Kotaku has been acquired by a Swissbased conglomerate for a cash sum that is undisclosed.\nSo, I guess good for them.\nAnd Google has launched an indie game fund initiative targeting Latam region.\nThe where they give between 150 to 200K to indie game studios based in Latin America.\nIt's pretty admirable that Google is doing funding.\nLike we talk about how challenging it is that VC and PE are kind of drying up and the money they're handing out.\nSo, it's always great when somebody's bringing money into the gaming industry.\nI just wonder what are the incentives for Google to write checks and actually these checks are so tiny.\nSo, I'm trying to understand like just how does this make sense?\nBut I guess I I don't know.\nMaybe they're working on some kind of a PC platform or something.\nYeah, they do have their their PC platform initiative.\nYou know, you can build on Android on mobile and it automatically goes to PC.\nIt's also specifically to the Latam region.\nSo, that's kind of interesting.\nStay ahead of the competition with Sensor Tower, the trusted source for mobile marketing intelligence.\nWhether you're tracking trends,

got?\nSo, there was a news article that came out from Mobile Gamer Viz, although this was reported more broadly that Blizzard is ending service for Warcraft Rumble.\nAnd no, you do not need to check the date.\nThis is 2025 that they are just shutting this down.\nThis game has only done 50 million life to date.\nAnd you know, I don't I don't want to call an object failure.\nI actually thought it proved quite a bit in terms of Blizzard's design prowess, but ultimately this design was 5 years out of date going after Clash Royale in a PvE format, even if it had a clever, you know, hook.\nAnd I think this is just symptomatic of developers really struggling to understand mobile and just the different mindset that you need to have if you're trying to do mobile.\nI think the recent news we've seen about Blizzard potentially like shopping some of their IP to South Korea is a really strong play.\nWhen you look at results like this, it seems like the strategy actually works from where they are.\nBut I can't even think of another HD developer that's done.\nWell, can you guys?\nYou remember Smite did the Clash Royale version as well?\nSmite is the game, but that's the the mobile the third person MOA in Steam.\nYeah, they did like a Clash Royale version as well.\nI remember at one point everybody was doing.\nBut the weirdest part about this is Blizzard came in so late that we even forgot about all the developers that failed and then Blizzard comes in.\nPhil, just to like minor correction, moving forward, we'll continue supporting Rumble with updates focused on regular and systemic in-game events and bug fixes, but no new content.\nSo, technically, it's still alive, just no new content.\nAnd the thing I just want to make sure we don't leave without mentioning is that there were 100 people on this game.\n100 people were on this game.\nI mean, this is a 100 people that could have been on Overwatch or like been on a growing product or on that survival game which they canled, which is still a genre that's doing well.\nAnd and 100 people in the US, not 100 people in like, you know, no offense, Romania or something.\nYeah, they're in Irvine.\nYeah.\nAnd Irvine, the cheap Irvine.\nOkay, let's move on to merge two.\nThere was a piece of news in mobile gamer biz again where one of the trail mix GMs Felicity Gracie Hurst gets on to talk about a lot of love and pies which is a game that has done really well in the merge 2 space has been one piece of news and it was interesting on why she's doing this PR push or what's up at trailmix and then we got a separate piece of news from Tristan Clark who is a co-founder at Trailmix reporting on LinkedIn that this is going to be his last week at Trailmix.\nSo, there's there's two things going on here.\nThere's the merge genre news and there's how Trail mix fits into it.\nJen, what's going on in merge?\nYeah, so I took a look.\nI used to love this genre as a human.\nI have since pivoted to your favorite all-in hole and the royal kingdom and royal matches.\nHad no time left in my life to continue to play Merch 2.\nUh, it's on fire.\nSo, I looked at Sensor Tower US year-to- date data.\nSo, that's what we're going to look at here.\nIt is the number two top revenue subgenre in puzzle.\nIt's number two right after the royal matches of the world.\nAnd more importantly, it's the number seven top revenue subgenre overall of all subg genres, right behind squad RPG, one of our favorites.\nAgain, this is just US year to date.\nLove and Pies is a top seven game in Merch 2.\nGossip Harbor's number one hundred million dollars year-to- date in the US alone.\nSuper super impressive.\nCrest, it's not mice nuts anymore, right?\nNot mice nuts.\nThat is next one is just basically showing that the genre during the last 12 months has doubled in terms of inapp purchases, which is a quite a growth.\nAnd you know, we're talking about declining market and this and that, but look at merge 2 just growing.\nAnd then I put in few of the top games as well as Love and Pie to just see how well this trailer mix title has fared as the genre has doubled.\nSo Gossip Harbor is essentially the game that is driving the growth on the genre as a whole.\nAnd of course there's plenty of new games that came in.\nTravel Town, Seaside Escape, Merge Mansion have been kind of holding steady, but Love and Pies has actually, you know, it's tiny compared those four largest one.\nLove and Pies has actually lost about 30% of its monthly revenue since the beginning of the year.\nSo, it's not fairing too well for Trailmix.\nAnd looking at Merge Mansion, which is another Supercell owned SLbacked company in the same genre, Metacor, right?\nMetacor.\nYeah, they've been they've been holding steady.\nThey used to be the number one.\nI think they took the position from Zingga and now they're at number four.\nAnd so everybody else is kind of keeping steady.\nSeaside grew a little bit, but it's really the Gossip Harbor that is absolutely just crushing.\nYeah, they're crushing it.\nAnd then Travel Town, uh, which was taken over by a Chinese company, Travel Town.\nYeah, that's Israeli.\nOh, Israeli.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nWhat's going on in Puzzle is really interesting is that especially in the last year or so, it's really broken into all of these different subg genres where you can really get into what's working and what's not working within each of these.\nLove and Pies is basically the original for Merge 2.\nThey're the OGs.\nThat's what everyone copied and I think they've just had a difficult time keeping up with what everyone else is doing and how they've really added in all the monetization.\nThey've taken a lot of social casino monetization components, meta collections to to really drive the category.\nSo, oh, let's go back to shooters cuz you know it's not a podcast with us if we don't talk about shooters.\nSo, uh life service shooter game comes to a premature end and this is Steel Hunters from Wargaming.\nIt's a mech game that we actually covered to quite a detail on this TWIG episode a few episodes ago.\nWe talked about Steel Hunters versus War Robots and Chris Sides was actually a guest host on the podcast and he came pretty hard at Steel Hunters talking of their gunplay and how they used the UE5 templates if I'm correct what he was mentioning and it felt very generic.\nIt looked different, but the play was not that interesting.\nAnd he was right.\nSo, it looks like Steel Hunters didn't make it.\nAnd Wargaming still continues with tanks and a little bit of ships.\nI don't remember if they have\nWe We need to talk about this next week, but I think the biggest story in all of this is Mecha Break, baby.\nLike Mecha Mecca is on [ __ ] Steam.\nIt broke over 100,000 CCUs.\nIt is a Japanese free-to-play Mecca game and you have a deep deep layer of customization.\nIt goes full full eastern and I think this thing Oh my god, I'm so excited to play this\n\n\nI haven't, I'm not deep enough in to provide a review.\nLet's talk about it next week.\nMy aspirations for the Gundam franchise are held in this video game.\nOh wow, it looks really cool.\nWow.\nIt's a shooter like action, but you're like flying.\nWait till we get to the home menus and look at progression is what I say.\nMecha Break.\nOh yeah.\nLook at all the character customization.\nAnd let me tell you, this is uh different, different cultural norms.\nYeah, they look really enhanced.\nReally enhanced.\nYeah.\nAnime uh pushed to the limits.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nWell, in the hope of being somewhat positive about what's actually working in the game industry right now, I came up with a topic to talk about is like basically the top seven games outside of puzzle that have done well in the west for the last two years, mind you, are the following: Pokemon, TCG Pocket, Dark War Survival, Top Heroes, Kingshot, Archer 2, Capibar Go, and Lassie Survival.\nAnd I know we've talked about kind of like the essences of these, but I just want to reiterate because I keep getting people saying kind of the same thing is that everyone seems to be wanting to build games that delight themselves, right?\nVersus games that actually do well in the marketplace.\nSo, um, I came across some article that was written, I've never met this or heard about this person, Ailen Yaziki.\nDoes anybody know her?\nIt was actually a really, really well-written piece on two particular games, a century games.\nWhite Out Survival and then Kingshot.\nAnd I've been playing Kingshot like a [ __ ] crack addict.\nPart of the reason I wanted to talk about this, I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on this game for me.\nAnd the whole point of all these games is the same thing I've been talking about since [ __ ] we were in Turkey like three years ago, right, when IDFA happened.\nIs that all these games have the same recipe.\nFirst of all, they're all made in China, right?\nSecond, they are casual gameplay with deep monetization design, right?\nFull stop, right?\nAnd they are deep.\nAnd when I say deep, I mean deep.\nLike they have so many different elements of engagement on these games, spending syncs and you know upgrade all these different mechanics and and systems that are geared towards building up your power level for your games.\nAnd so she wrote this piece about these two particular games and it's basically saying how the 4X genre is kind of evolving with like you know these hybrid casual mechanics which reduce complexity in terms of the funnel but then it makes it again a much more deeper game when you get into it right by doing that it's much easier to acquire users and and less expensive in in the hope to get the whales.\nAnd the whole concept here is that the fact is that the majority of the of the money is being generated by a very, very, very, very small percentage of the people and so you need to capture them in some ways with deep monetization design.\nThat is what's critical to this business.\nRight?\nSo she kind of writes about this on on how the forex genre is evolving.\nUm, all I really wanted to say is that mass market gameplay helps bring people to the game, but the demonetization is what actually makes money for the game and justifies all the UA spend.\nAnd so again, stop focusing on Warcraft Rumble and games that delight.\nIt's just all about figuring out ways of monetizing them.\nAnd even these games like Grow Garden is egregious.\nAbsolutely.\nPeople have no idea.\nPeople have no idea.\nIt is like the absolute worst in terms of extraction of all possible.\nLike the most casual game.\n[ __ ] gross.\nAbsolutely gross.\nThat's what it takes to make games successful nowadays.\nThat's what it takes.\nBut that game is going to be here today, gone tomorrow.\nBut these games are actually sticking around and growing and continue to attract user.\nSo, I just wanted to say this is what's working in the marketplace right now and scaling outside of puzzle, right?\nPuzzle is kind of a different ballgame, but from a core type gameplay and game mechanics.\nI did a little webinar on the grow garden.\nI looked into that one cuz I worked on Farmville and it's basically Farmville for kids with Phil's love of monetization, rarity, scarcity.\nI mean the whole thing mutations stealing stealing stealing the live ops people don't understand there's a real live ops strategy in grow a garden there is not only that there are chained offers remember these are very young developers like implementing the best of monization practices and there is no place where there is not a tentacle that monization will go in Roblox games and it's out of New Zealand right there's two teams like there's the original developer yeah there's a 16-year-old kid and then someone else bought I think a share And so they co-develop it and there's there's some headcount on the project now.\nIt's it's not just a small team anymore.\nYeah.\nOne of the guys from the new company that took it over, he's a basically a Roblox influencer himself.\nAnd so once they took it over and I think they have like 49% of the game and he started to talk about it, it blew up.\nAnd then every Saturday morning and I think it's 7:00 a.m. Pacific time, you can just watch the CCU spike with the update.\nSo every week they've got brand new live ops, brand new events, brand new things to buy.\nAnd the way that they do it is just, you know, like Phil, it's the deepest monetization that you would see in some of the hardcore games just added to this silly farming game.\nIt would make the original Farmville developers from Zingga blush.\nOh, yeah.\nYou know, in terms of the monetization design.\nI mean, it is unfucking believable, right?\nIt is sickening.\nAbsolutely sickening.\nBut again, it's going to be gone in a few months.\nI think like we're not even going to be talking about this in a few weeks.\nSo, it's not a sustainable model, but it's certainly I think you're still missing the headline, Eric, which is Roblox's ability to grow hits like this.\nThat's the real story here, which I think is interesting because they took something from nothing to something based on organics basically alone.\nYeah.\nThis is just like Zinga and Canvas on Facebook.\nThis is exactly the same thing.\nYou extract as much money as possible from the consumer and move the [ __ ] on.\nYou know, that's why Zingga was like a destined to fail is because they just extracted as much money from the users and then moved them on to the next game which monetized less.\nThey pulled the means of distribution right from under their [ __ ] noses, you know?\nAnd so I don't think Roblox is going to do that.\nBut the next like sickening game is going to come out and they're going to move on to that, you know, like that's the way this business is going to work.\nI paint it in a better way.\nLike I think at Zingga they called it like the Death Star.\nLike they're building the Death Star and you just kind of like point it and launch it.\nLike that was always Farmville is like they cross-promote things and like Aldderon like explosion.\nI think the real story is that Roblox like it sounds like they finally have their death star which is the platform like just point this thing and you know they can scale any game on the platform.\nI mean that's that's incredible.\nThis is the most played game in the [ __ ] world.\nEven if the arpoo is really low, which it is, that is not insignificant.\nYou're not giving enough credit to the influencers that draw people in to make this a thing.\nNo, influencers are at the other end of the funnel.\nInfluencers cannot make something that's not popular popular.\nLike they are just as much writing the demand wave as anyone else.\nLike most popular games are the top stream games.\nCS GO, Dota, League of Legends.\nDude, when Farmville was coming out in Canvas, people were saying the same exact thing, right?\nThis is the most people that have played a game in the history of man.\nAnd that matters, right?\nLike that mattered for Candy Crush.\nThat matters for Farmville.\nLike they rode that for a long time.\nThat wasn't insignificant.\nthat mattered for Fortnite.\nOf course, it matters.\nAnd Fargo, by the way, is still around.\nI know it's crazy, but the difference is they maintain these audiences for the successes like Fortnite and Candy Crush.\nYeah.\nThese audiences are going away, right?\nYeah.\nAnd I think that's fair.\nYou know, let's look at how this one holds up.\nLet's also look at other platform titles like Adopt Me.\nLike there are games with like stable live service.\nYeah.\nI'm not condemning Roblox.\nI'm just condemning, you know, the the hit driven like games like this.\nLike it's amazing, but it's not sustainable, right?\nI don't know.\nUh that a lot of the games in the top Roblox charts have been there for a while.\nYes, it's going the hype is going to die down because squirrel because you know these kids have an attention span of 6 to 8 weeks and it's summer.\nThey're likely going to stay addicted all summer and then maybe it'll drop down when school goes back in.\nIt's not going to maintain this level, but it might not go out of the top 10 or 20 unless they stop supporting with live ops or if something else comes in to take its place.\nYou know what's interesting here is it's finally the farming genre.\nI know it's crazy to think that farming and kids is like the next genre, but you know, if I'm a Roblox developer, I'm going to go mine all of the other games for 60-year-old women, which is the irony here is like that was the audience for Farmville was like 60-year-old women in Iowa who love that game for a very different reason.\nThey took all of the like Pokemon trading card mechanics and put it into a farming theme.\nAnd so I think you're going to see a lot of that if I had to guess is go find a different theme and then just, you know, layer in all of Phil's favorite monetization mechanics.\nAll right.\nYeah, I think that's everything.\nAll right,
