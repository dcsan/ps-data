  "cleanText": "On even worse news.\nSo, this rumor has been around for a while since GDC, so I've been holding on to it, but it's been confirmed by multiple sources at this stage.\nIs that the company, The Believer, a Los Angeles-based company, and if you could remember this, it was founded by former Riot Games execs Michael Chow and Steven Snow, and it was an Andreessen/ Lightspeed joint.\nWhat possibly could go wrong?\n$55 million of serious aid funding like in March of 2023.\nAgain, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, our friend Morates, Andrezen, Bitcraft, Riot, OneUp, Cleveland, and Michael Eisner's Turnante company, where the [ __ ] that is.\nAll right, so they have been confirmed.\nBeliever has shut down last Friday.\nBeliever is [ __ ] crazy.\nReally?\nIs this the last AAA domino to fall?\nWhat's left?\nProbably monsters.\nOh, no.\nThis is this is the the revenge of the fat.\nWe're just getting started, dude.\nWe're just getting started.\n2021 was disastrous investments in all kinds of companies that made no sense, and it's going to be $55 million.\nSo, basically, my understanding, and people are going to be mad, I know, but they had $55 million in funding, blew that in two years, right?\nIn less than two years.\nAnd generally speaking, it seemed like they had absolutely no oversight in terms of spend from their venture investors at all.\nAnd at the end of the day, when they came out to GDC, they had nothing to show for it, right?\nI don't even think they even had a vertical slice.\nI think they had more concept type stuff.\nSo, they went to back for more funding at GDC and they couldn't get it right.\nSo, I I wish the best for the 80 souls out there that 80 plus souls that are part of this company.\n80, something like that.\nThey break.\nThey were given like million dollars.\nI whatever I I heard all kinds of stuff.\nI Nothing is confirmed, but I Anyway, we can use all this great talent in the big publishers.\nSo, let's hopefully they come back and do their thing somewhere else.\nThere we go.\nThat's So, we're going to talk about this in VCs and PES talk today because like the oversight is part of the things that private equity would do and definitely not something that that venture capital seems to do.\nBut Chris, what do you think is the next one?\nIs Gardens the next one?\nI I really don't want Gardens.\nI really like those guys.\nI'm not saying like that's a bad team or anything.\nThey're great and absolutely but like giving this trail is like but yeah, they had a lot more to show and they were further along and I think they were far more prudent with their investments and their salaries.\nThey were actually acting like a startup company versus my understanding with what happened with Believer.\nSo and theory Craft is another one, right?\nTheory craft is did the gold belly belly up or well I mean this next story is the same story really right build a rocket boy oh so talk to me about build a rocket boy.\nBuild A Rocket Boy.\nAll right so Build A Rocket Boy was founded by ex GTA Lie Benzes right and they are building a game called Minds Eyee which is a huge GTA style game and a more futuristic like more techy type thing right cyberpunk.\nSo anyway, they he had some issues with Rockstar and he left and it is unclear exactly how much money, but the one round that they did confirm was $110 million series D.\nSeries D, mind you.\nSo there's still A, B, and C.\nAnd so it could be I would imagine it's somewhere in the 300 million range at least.\nMaybe seven years in the running.\nSeven years.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBut they were acquired like an acquire I think by PlayFusion to further invest in this game right and so I don't know man they pushed this thing out right it clearly wasn't ready and it's been an absolute train wreck like this Mind's Eye game and the reason I found out about it which is even more crazy I am still in touch with what's going on but I still didn't know about this game coming out but my son was watching this YouTube guy who's really funny by the way and he went on for an hour and showcasing all the bugs and all like the crazy [ __ ] that happens in this game that it's completely not ready for prime time.\nSo, I think their ambition got a little bit ahead of their capability to some degree, but they had 300 people evidently in Edinburgh, Budapest, and Mia.\nSo, this game has been labeled the worst rated game in 2025.\nIt has a Metacritic score of 37 out of 100, a user score of 2.5 out of 10.\nOh, very solid.\nYeah.\nSo, technical issues, outdated gameplay, described as dystopian future that plays like it's from 2012, disjointed narrative, nothing was really good about this game at all.\nIt was an absolute disaster.\nI mean, it was absolutely massive, too.\nAnd so, like, it must have cost a fortune to build.\nAnd they did a Beyonce drop on it, right?\nIsn't this the one where I don't know if someone's going to talk about this where the two people left?\nYeah.\nSo, like cuz Chris went through the timelines and your timeline and then December 2024, but the real timeline actually continued to June 2025.\nThe game released in June 2025, but also there was a couple of other releases.\nAnd those releases were the chief legal officer and chief financial officer left the company.\nAnd here's this, the CFO changed the name and URL of his LinkedIn account.\nLike I have no info about this, but this of course doesn't indicate anything very good.\nAnd with so much money raised and such a powerful set of investors that they have, they have like Red Bird and like these billiondollar New York funds that have put in money into them, this can turn really ugly really quick as they start looking for who is to be at fault.\nAnd now you don't have your second and first line defense, which is your chief legal officer and your chief financial officer.\nSo, I hope it's just a bad game.\nLet's let's just leave it at that.\nAll right.\nSo, we're covering a lot here.\nI wonder if someone is keeping track of all of these, you know, bigname founders who get a [ __ ] ton of startup money.\nIs there a scorecard?\nBecause what feels like is going on is that your chance of being Crest's kid getting into the NBA is higher than your chance of being an ex bigname company winning at a startup.\nIs that the new bet?\nYeah, that's a little unfair, but yes.\nNo, in a good way.\nLike I actually think I can make it.\nI'm just joking.\nI'm just teasing.\nUm, can you give me a little bit more color, Eric, on like how would you do venture capital in AAA if at all?\nSee, here's the thing, though.\nWhen I look at this on paper, though, it's a large amount of fixed capital for a series of revenue to be delivered later on.\nLike, that feels like a VC style problem is to take on those losses for year after year after year.\nThat feels like akin to the VC model.\nNo, that's actually the opposite of the VC model.\nThe VC model is you invest and you build it over time and you continue to invest as you scale over time.\nYeah, that's the problem with AAA.\nThat's why it works for mobile to some degree because you you revenue coming out.\nYou build revenue, you spend money on UA, you raise more money and then you and you scale and then you sell or go IPO, right?\nMhm.\nBut with AAA, it's like you just build for five, six, seven years like a money pit.\nIt releases, you get revenue for a few months and then you're done.\nYou know, that's fair.\nThey can't show any traction.\nLike at least when you're taking on losses with Uber, you can show, you know, increase in riders or drivers, but they have nothing to show.\nThey have no real validation of demand, right?\nAnd once the game is out, you have to start that all over again.\nIt's like five or six years.\nIt's just not a VC model, right?\nAnd so, so we're starting to see these new publishing things start to come up like Kepler is coming.\nWhatever this thing joint is with Owen Mahoney and Bing and stuff like that, like another there like you know, I've been consulting foris which is like a similar idea.\nIt's like these are the ones that should be placing multiple bets across different types of products and different types of teams in order to build another publishing organization, right, to compete to some degree, right, with some of the bigger publishers and see some of these double A, single A, and then potentially AAA games come to market.\nThat's the appropriate model for gaming, AAA gaming in general, right?\nNot the VC model.\nBut but the publishing model is still the same though, right?\nLike you're putting aside capital with no return in the short run over and over again every single month except with the publisher model.\nYou have milestones.\nSo there are deliverables to measure traction but it's still not validating demand, right?\nBut a publisher model are people that are actually publishers like that know games.\nLike the venture capitalists don't know games, right?\nThese people that are investing in games know [ __ ] all about games, you know?\nLike I want to double click on what Crest said because that's the point like with these big funding rounds.\nA lot of these investors are generalist investors and they are the ones who are pouring these tens of millions because they're gigantic funds and that's what we're seeing also as a problem.\nThere are funds that are run by people who actually are in gaming but they are not billion dollar funds.\nI mean some of them are kind of right now but they are the problem.\nThey being thrown like $110 million round D on a company that hasn't shipped a game in seven years.\nYou have to not know anything about gaming to do that.\nIt's ridiculous for me to like second guess what was happening in 2021 when money was so cheap and there was just so much of it and people were trying to just get into the gaming space because it was hot hot hot.\nBut at the end of the day, the right longer term model I think is more of a publishing model for gaming where you can make multiple bets and have like a pipeline of products and people that are managing the [ __ ] process which I think is the problem that happened with Believer is that they had no oversight, right?\nThey were hiring engineers for like a million, $2 million salary.\nSomething ridiculous like I was hearing.\nIt's like that's not the way you build a startup, right?\nThat's not a startup.\nWhat about something else that doesn't seem to be tracking?\nWell, yeah.\nSo, yeah, Bungie basically announced an indefinite delay for Marathon.\nSo, it was supposedly coming out September 23rd, but as you recall, the feedback from the alpha test was very, very negative.\nSo they are basically kind of reassessing the strategy and changing parts of the game.\nI think this is like kind of bad news, good news.\nLike it's really bad news that the game is delayed indefinitely clearly, right?\nBut the good news is that Sony's not getting rid of it, right?\nThey're not canceling it or shutting down Bungie, which is was another option for Sony in theory.\nSo they're going to give it some time to like make it better and see if they can pull it off.\nI think it's actually kind of good.\nYeah.\nNet net, you know, to me.\nYeah.\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint.\n[ __ ] dad joke.\nOh my god.\nHe was waiting for it.\nGod damn it.\nI want to talk about remedy.\nSo they launched today.\nI think today or yesterday they launched their version of Hell Divers, which is FBC Fire Break.\nIt's not really looking as a fire break.\nIt has like 60% positive.\nSo looking, you know, all righty.\nThis game particularly, I'm not sure how long has been in development.\nI listened to the podcast with the CEO.\nI know that they have been developing this sort of a multiplayer shooter.\nIt was first to be a free-to-play and then it changed to probably what this is for at least 7 years.\nIt was called the project Vanguard.\nAt one point it was being developed out of Finland, then it got developed out of Sweden.\nI don't know where this game comes from, but if it seems like a pivoted to this.\nIn the podcast, the CEO said they spend about $30 million on development costs plus marketing of this game.\nThis is the first self-published game from Remedy, which is interesting.\nHe said that they need to sell, was it 10 million to break even?\nI think he said they need to sell two million to break even or something like that.\nSo, it's not that crazy.\nThe game costs between $30 to $40 if I'm correct.\nIt has two different SKs.\nIt was released though at the same time on Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, which kind of indicates that they knew that the potential for this game is quite limited.\nSo, Remedy is the last public gaming company on Finnish stock exchanged.\nIt was interesting.\nI listened to the podcast with the CEO and interestingly enough because the reporter seemed to have read the hard truths about the Finnish game industry, my doof blog post that got that got very viral here in Finland and me deported.\nAnd so, the question that she was asking was pretty much from what I wrote, which was very interesting.\nAnd to summarize it, the remedy CEO kind of to be honest blamed the competition for limited the success they've had, saying that well the competition and he always talked about the west coast that the salaries on the west coast are so high and the budgets are so big and that's the competition and just the the situation in the market.\nBut the reality is looking at remedy it is a fantastic studio.\nI think it's they've been live for 25 years.\nGames like Maxpane, Alan Wake, Control, really really good at at making these double A games.\nWhen they IPOed, it seems like they raised capital to the owners because they didn't build out their publishing function.\nAnd I think that is kind of influencing them still.\nYou know, their product strategy is very focused on very much a niche singleplayer horror games like apart from Resident Evil, what's what's in this category?\nAnd they they kind of left out some of the games that they were doing before.\nLike I remember when I was a kid, I played Death Rally, which was one of their game, Max Pain.\nThey sold that to Rockstars.\nAll the IP rights.\nI think they are making a game now with Rockstar on that one.\nAnd their budgets, even though they're quite small, like when we're talking about $30 million a game, they're still too big to\n\n\nCover their returns because after the release of the last one, which was Alan Wake 2, it got insane Metacritics.\nThey had to, I think, take a loan to kind of stay afloat.\nAnd when you look at their financial returns, they made $51 million euros last year in revenue, and the EBIT was minus 4 million.\nDidn't Epic publish that?\nYeah.\nAnd so, because they didn't build out their own publishing function, their games are published by all kinds of different companies, and they kind of don't own their fate.\nEven though last year it lost like four million or so, that revenue was up actually 50%.\nSo, that was a good year.\nAnd even on a good year, it wasn't actually that strong.\nSo, Remedy is kind of perfect example of what's going on in the Finnish game industry.\nThe market has changed considerably.\nNevertheless, the game studios kind of retracted and are doubling down on what worked before.\nSo, just focus on the game, focus on the gameplay, focus on the experience, just craft a good product.\nAnd when you put in all your focus on the product and kind of leave everything else to others like publishing, like marketing, you end up building these really, really goodlooking games, but your faith is in the hands of somebody else.\nIt's in the hands of the publisher, right?\nIt feels like they've made products that either misses the market or is just not competitive in the market.\nAnd now they are, as the CEO said, going more towards what works in the market by building a multiplayer game in the setting that they have developed, but at the same time this game doesn't have live ops, and you know, the first kind of reviews coming in are not exactly Hell Divers, so I don't know.\nIt's going to be interesting to follow, but it's kind of sad that they didn't build this.\nThis is a disaster.\nI was looking at this.\nI'm trying to be nice.\nThis is an utter disaster, like when you look at the Steam numbers, which you shared and we have on the screen right now.\nThere is only about 2,000 peak CCU on Steam.\nAnd you're telling me this was released for free on PlayStation Plus and Game Pass, which sometimes I'm a fan of.\nYou want to get initial distribution, especially in a live service game.\nBut if you're telling me you're getting what, maybe 30 million from PlayStation Plus, that's just a random guess.\nAnd like let's say 15 million downloads off of Game Pass, I know that's extremely generous as well.\nYou're telling me like they're getting no uplift in PC from that massive console distribution?\nThis is over.\nLike this is self-published.\nIt's Dunzos.\nThat updates your priors, I think, on the Game Pass and PS+ distribution, too.\nBe the game of the year for Finnish Game Awards in 2020.\nFive.\nOh god, they should kick you out.\nIn fact, we'll find out soon if they did.\nBut they do build amazing games and amazing single player games, and it kind of bums me out that they are in this horror genre.\nSo I feel like if they would control their own publishing, they would be bigger.\nI don't know where that IPO money went.\nI don't know what they did with it because they've let others publish their game for eight years after the IPO.\n[Music]\n",
