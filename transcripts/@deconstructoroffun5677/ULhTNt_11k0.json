  "cleanText": "This is the kickoff of MAU Vegas 2025.\nI'm Jen Donahoe.\nI host Deconstructor of Fun.\nUh, we are a game industry podcast, and I'm also a reform big company game industry marketer.\nUh, Monopoly GO!, that's the reason we're here today, is the mobile game that has broken records and rules.\nAnd I'm thrilled to speak with Scopely CMO Ben Webley.\nUh, we're going to go behind the scenes and unpack a lot of what made the go-to-market so amazing.\nSo before we jump in, let me just set a little bit of the game board, uh, with a little background on Monopoly GO!.\nSo Monopoly GO! launched back in April of 2023, and it broke a ton of records.\nIt was the number one game launch of that year.\nIt reached a billion in revenue just seven months later.\nIt was one of the fastest mobile games to ever reach this milestone.\nFast forward, and Monopoly GO! is still crushing it.\nThey just announced passing five billion in revenue in just two years.\nOne of the things that I learned from Monopoly that I've been really impressed with is that, uh, they have such global awareness, and you know what's really interesting is most people think that Monopoly is from their own country.\nSo how did you think about leveraging this kind of insight that is really unique for an IP, which is everyone thinks that the IP is from their country?\nYeah.\nSo, I've got quite an interesting story, actually, and it's embarrassing one for me, but here we go.\nAnd I was in a meeting with Hasbro and a bunch of Hasbro executives, and, uh, they were talking about playing Monopoly growing up.\nAnd I, I was really confused, and I asked them, I was like, \"You guys played Monopoly growing up?\"\nAnd they're like, \"Well, yeah.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Oh, that's weird.\"\nAnd they were like, \"Why is that weird?\"\nI was like, \"Well, it's a British game.\nI just didn't think that would be that popular in America.\"\nAnd, um, so obviously after being laughed at for a while, uh, one, one of the executives actually said to me, well, to be honest, he said, \"What's really interesting with this brand is that people actually think it's their own game in their own country.\nHe said, \"In France, they think it's French, and in UK, they think it's British, and and that's what's so great about this brand.\nEveryone thinks it's their, their local game.\"\nYou know, I, I, I think I hear a lot of people talk about Monopoly as global IP.\nAnd I, I just, it didn't resonate with me, and I, I thought that wasn't the right way for us to think about it.\nSo instead, what I asked the team to think about, and and for myself as well, is I was like, \"I think we need, this isn't a global IP.\nThat's the wrong way to think about this.\nIt's everybody's local IP.\"\nYou know, we work with a lot of IP at Scopely, and it's really important when you work with IP to be very respectful to the IP, to be very authentic to the IP, and, uh, and I wanted to do that with Monopoly.\nUm, so instead of just localizing the creative, we went to the level of truly culturalizing the creative.\nSo, I wanted to make sure that the creatives themselves were truly culturalized because I wanted to give everybody their game and bring that nostalgia and make it feel like the monopoly they they knew and love.\nSo, um, it was a lot more work.\nI won't lie.\nWe created thousands and thousands of creators because we were trying to do that in as many countries as possible.\nUh, but I think it paid off, and I think it was so important.\nUm, and we wanted to win in every country.\nWe did.\nWe, um, we got to number one over 100 countries, which we're very proud of.\nWe had, um, a strategy we called, uh, \"leave no country behind\" because we just didn't want to, to sort of leave countries out.\nWe wanted every country to get their version of monopoly, and and we, we, we were playing a win, and we wanted to win in every country.\nWe also have a philosophy, um, at Scopely, and that's we try and break our own ideas, and I think this is important both for product and for marketing.\nAnd what we mean by breaking our own ideas is, I think, as humans, like human nature is, when we come up with a good idea, we seek out the information and the data that supports that idea, right?\nAnd and I think we'll do it, and I think it's very natural to do.\nAnd one of the things we try and do, um, be it, and and I'll walk through this example with the app app icon in a minute, but is we try and challenge our ideas, not by not just looking for other information, but actually looking for information that basically makes our idea wrong, that that breaks it, right?\nIn the way we look at it is, if you try and break your ideas enough and they just don't break, then they are good ideas.\nIf they break easily, it's not a good idea, and you should really rethink about that.\nHere's an example of app icon testing.\nNow this is doing a disservice to the number of app icons we actually tested.\nWe created a lot.\nSo the first thing we did is we put out a bunch of different icons, right?\nAnd you can see in the first test, again, there were a lot more than this.\nThese are just some samples of things that we thought are going to resonate.\nNow, I care about every little tiny part of the funnel.\nSo app icon, it's important to me.\nThe number one thing.\nYeah, it's important.\nThis is important as a creative.\nYeah, as a description.\nEvery part of the funnel can be optimized.\nSo we should optimize every part of the funnel.\nSo with the app icons, you know, we asked the team, okay, let's go and test a bunch of stuff.\nWe did, um, player insights testing as well as ASO testing.\nBut if you see the, uh, the green box around the top left icon in test one, that's actually the one you see today.\nSo that was the the winning creative.\nBut after we did the first test, rather than stopping there, but also rather than saying, \"Oh, that's probably the best icon.\nLet's just check.\"\nInstead, we said, \"No, no, no.\nWe don't like it.\nWe want to find a better icon.\"\nLike, \"Let's break that icon.\nLet's make, let's find, there's got to be something better.\nLet's go and find something better.\"\nAnd the difference, I think, in doing that is your mindset's different, right?\nIf you're trying to just say it's probably the best one.\nLet's do some other tests.\nYou're not really trying to break it, right?\nYou're not really putting the effort in.\nSo, we really tried to find something better.\nIn fact, I didn't tell my team I liked the icon.\nI actually told them I didn't like it, and I wanted a different one.\nAnd, um, so I was like, \"Let's go find something else.\nThat's not good enough.\nLet's find something else.\"\nBut the whole point is we just kept trying to break it.\nTrying to break, trying to break it.\nWell, one of the things that's interesting, and I was having this conversation with someone recently, is notice that it's red, and, um, so in my prior world, I made a lot of toys.\nUm, you know, power all these different toy brands, and what I always found is that red packaging tended to do the best because it's a hot color, whereas blue and some of the lighter colors are cool colors, and so you feel more calm.\nRed is more attention getting.\nRed or yellow are hot colors, and so, and pro tip is always make sure that you are testing cool versus hot and understand, you know, red does kind of, that's why red and yellow tend to be the most popular, uh, ASO backgrounds.\nUh, free, free tip for everyone, uh, going into that.\nCool.\nAll right.\nSo, you broke it, and then, um, you know, let's talk a little bit about like how people actually break each other playing this.\nI don't know how many of you like fought with your family every holiday playing Monopoly.\nBut it is a timeless game that has two kind of core aspects or key aspects to the core fantasy.\nSo, one is you're making alliances, and then you're breaking them.\nThe game features actually leverage this incredibly well.\nBut how did you take that core fantasy of like alliances and breaking alliances and really look at that from a community and a, a social perspective to really think about the verality from a marketing perspective?\nYeah.\nI, I mean, if again, if you've played Monopoly GO!, you realize this game's a lot more fun and rewarding playing with others, right?\nAnd that's by design.\nThis game is really designed to play with others.\nOne, that's very true to Monopoly, right?\nIt is a game where you're, you're playing, you're playing with people you love, but you're also attacking them and taking all their money, right?\nSo, we want to capture a lot of that in in the game.\nA big part of this game is the the sticker trading.\nSo, there's, you know, you're attacking each other.\nYou're doing co-op events together.\nThe meta around this game trading is very, very popular.\nIt gives a sort of larger purpose to why you're doing the core loop every day.\nWe made a very conscious decision in the product to not build the trading into the product, which sounds counterintuitive because it'd be nice and easy if you and I can trade and click the button, right?\nBe very easy.\nBut one, one of the things is we really care about building hyperengaged communities at Scopely, and you know, we believe a lot of the biggest and best games have that, they have huge communities around them that live and exist outside the product.\nUm, so we wanted to kind of meet communities where they are and develop communities outside the product, and we wanted trading to be a way communities engage with each other and not just a transaction.\nSo instead, what we did is we pushed the trading to Facebook.\nWe have about just over 9 million people in our core group today.\nUm, and we figured if we push on to Facebook there, they can meet people, they can interact, they can trade.\nUm, and and and it's more of a community platform.\nThen we thought about, well, how can we leverage though this really engaged big population of people to help sort of, you know, drive awareness and and promotion.\nSo, one of the things we did is I was like, we need to get them to Tik Tok.\nSo, we had this place now where we could talk to our really engaged community members.\nWe did more things like that where we're moving people onto Tik Tok, onto Insta, where we could then get things going where again, those channels themselves are going to show the game to new people, and that's what I wanted.\nSo again, like these, these whole community groups, they're not only great for building community around the product, they can actually be leveraged and used in a way that helps us drive more reality and organic growth for the product as well.\nSo back in November, you actually launched a brand campaign, uh, it's called \"Friendship Pays,\" and so this had Will Ferrell as Mr. Monopoly.\nIt also had Chris Pratt, Kiki Palmer, and then the best hair guy of all time, Jason Mamoa.\nSo, in this campaign, you know, everyone knows that friendship is is a part of this, even though it's also about, you know, breaking alliances.\nSo, there's often this tension that happens between performance marketing and brand marketing.\nI know all of you feel it.\nUm, so, but you were crushing it in your way.\nAbsolutely winning.\nHow did you think about and conceptualizing?\nOkay, now we want to do a brand campaign.\nYeah.\nSo we actually see this, we don't really think of brand campaigns.\nWe think more around how do we extend what we're already doing, and we think of it more 360.\nSo, um, I mean, first of all, you know, we didn't do this campaign for about 18 months after launch.\nI'm a big believer for launch, community, creative, and UA do so much heavy lifting.\nSo think 360, everything, influencers, TV, connected TV, UA, it all worked together and was all part of the campaign.\nWe actually saw this as this is going to be like this thing that's going to last over a year, and we're going to build creative in a way that benefits UA, it benefits, uh, a social and Tik Tok, and we actually recorded, and by the way, Jason, wonderful guy, has great hair.\nUm, but they were a lot of fun.\nSo we were trying to get things even with them authentically to record, you know, some things they were doing where they're talking to the camera and they're messing around, cuz we're like, that's not good for TV, that's fantastic for Tik Tok.\nThank you for sharing the secrets and and thank you to the marketing team behind this.\nUm, you know, they often don't get all the credit.\nThe game team gets a lot of the credit.\nSo, I'm glad that we had a chance to hear a little bit more of of the story.\nAwesome.\nCool.\nThanks for having me.\n",
