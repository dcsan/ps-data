  "cleanText": "Thank you, Sam Aune. Welcome to the podcast. Hello, Mishka. Good to be here.\n\nSo, Sam, you are a gaming insights analyst at Sensor Tower, the author of the *State of Mobile Gaming* report. My favorite report this year. Welcome! Specifically because of that.\n\nNo. And you're here to get a promotion, right?\n\nThat's correct. Yeah, that's the only reason.\n\nWell, I hope it works out.\n\nSo, um, no, but really, I wanted to have you on the podcast and dive deeper into the report.  I think a lot of people have downloaded it, but not maybe all of them have truly analyzed it, because there's a lot of insights. And what I like about the way you bring the insights forward is you're very positive about the market. You filter; you look at the things that are growing rather than being the pessimist like myself, who's like, \"Oh my god, when are we going to see the next big hit? Why isn't the market growing as fast as it used to?\" So kudos to you for staying positive.\n\nThank you. Yeah, it's easier, I think, to stay positive in my position whenever I'm always looking at the Sensor Tower platform, and I'm able to see what the top 10 are. Oh, this game is doing well. This game is growing. Uh, whenever you're constantly looking at these positive things, it's easier to stay an optimist. Uh, I don't discount anyone who's a little bit more negative than me, but yeah, I like to stay positive in general. I would say we'd need a specific Sam Aune filter on Sensor Tower that kind of brings the positive. So when you're feeling a little bit down, you just use the SAM filter and be like, \"Oh, actually things are growing. It's not as gloomy.\"\n\nExactly. Yeah. Don't look over there in that dark space. Just look over here. This is where you want to see.\n\nExactly.\n\nWell, let's start looking at the bunch of questions that I have. So, one of the things is the basic one: has gaming plateaued? Uh, because the downloads have plateaued since 2020, and I can actually show the graph. So, if you're listening to this on Spotify, uh, probably easier to look at the graphs, but if or just check it out on YouTube, but the first graph that I have here is *Mobile Gaming Plateau and What's Next*. So can you talk a little bit about this and it's like, are we plateaued? Are we growing? What's the current phase?\n\nYeah, it does seem like we're plateaued a bit for sure on the download side. Uh, it's been, as you noted, uh, kind of going down since 2020. However, I think it's important to note that 2020 was not a normal year. Of course, we had a huge growth, and then uh, it's kind of natural to kind of revert to the mean from there, I would say. Uh, and if you kind of take a longer-term, uh, zoom-out approach, uh, I think maybe it's arguable for sure that uh, we're seeing more of a long-term kind of stable growth, uh, in ter—at least in terms of in-app purchase revenue, which is what—if we look at the bottom parts of the screen—uh, we've been seeing a little bit of growth in this past year, which is nice to not have a—uh—not have a little bit of a decrease year-over-year, unfortunate in the previous years, which is…\n\nAnd how do these trends look like when you start removing certain very mature markets like China, Japan, Korea, which are really big markets on their own? Like what does the graph look like?\n\nYeah, absolutely. Uh, so unfortunately, in the past four quarters, we do still see a decline in downloads—about 5%—if we discount those three markets for the past four quarters over the previous four quarters. Uh, but again, if you if you zoom out and you remove these more mature markets, I think it becomes a little bit more pronounced that yeah, maybe we're seeing a little bit more long-term kind of healthy curve.\n\nOkay. And what's the uh what's the comparison of downloads? Uh, when you look at iOS versus Google downloads and revenue, is it still so that Google drives most of the downloads and iOS drives most of the revenue?\n\nThat's absolutely how it looks. Yeah, there's a couple other key differences. I would say iOS leans a bit more Western, while Google Play leans more towards Eastern and Emerging Markets. Uh, iOS is a bit more expensive, competitive compared to Google Play, but with a more valuable audience. Uh, and behaviorally, I think iOS players tend to engage more with things like in-app purchase monetization, long-term progression mechanics, while Google Play players are more likely to engage with ad-monetized content. So something like the Hybrid Casual Games that we've seen a resurgence of lately uh tend to see a lot of success on Google Play.\n\nAnd what's the trend line there? Is it changing? Is it stable in terms of the revenue percentage iOS versus Google as well as download percentage iOS versus Google?\n\nYeah. Uh, so we do see most of the downloads decline on Android, actually. Uh, iOS devices are also down in the past four quarters over the previous four quarters. So sorry, I'm actually bringing some a little bit fresher data. Good, including the last quarter. Um, but yeah, the iOS down—devices are down 1% for downloads, but actually iPhones are up 2% in downloads uh for the past four quarters over the previous four. So that's that's some slightly good news, hopefully, uh for people out there.\n\nInteresting. And on a high level, have you thought about—like is there something you can see from the insights of developers and publishers rethinking User Acquisition, rethinking monetization strategies because we are looking at a very mature market?\n\nYeah, absolutely. Uh, in terms of how developers are rethinking User Acquisition and monetization strategies here, uh, Mobile Gaming has always been competitive, but I think it's more important than ever to stand out.  The smaller edges become more important. Getting creative, uh, I think becomes more of a necessity than a risk. If you're just copying other games, it's…\n\n\nLess of a winning strategy, I would say. Innovation is becoming more key. There's always a market for good games. There always will be, I would say.  But more specifically, I have to preface with the idea that I'm not a super expert in User Acquisition. I've never worked on a User Acquisition team, but this is just kind of what I've seen in working here and talking with people. Maybe doubling down on creative testing and iteration to find those winning creatives is still more important than ever. There's a lot of interesting creative trends that I saw throughout the year. I think one overarching trend that I saw was a focus on existing audiences. So things like IPs—IP collaborations or the innate IPs to your game—using things like celebrities or influencers, celebrities in particular. I thought I saw an interesting trend of games using kind of smaller celebrities, where it's a celebrity that your audience might recognize from a certain show that's really popular with them, but is not Jake Paul.  That might be more the influencer side of things. You got the idea. Like being more targeted and cost-effective. I think trying to lower those CPIs is definitely a priority for User Acquisition teams at the moment.  Because the way I understand it, the CPI trend has been pointing upwards, and so it feels like a lot of the innovation is going on the marketing side. And the other part where we're seeing innovation is, of course, live ops. Let me show the live ops curve you have here. So what we're seeing is that the time in games has actually increased. It's 8% more year-over-year that people are spending playing games, logging more sessions than ever before. Can you talk a little bit about what are the genres that are clear winners in terms of game developers? We know that great gameplay is what players love, but integrating metagame features like challenges, progression, and rewards is crucial for retention and Monetization. However, coding them is a tedious and time-consuming process. That's why top studios have turned to Hero.

So some of the genres in terms of which genres are seeing the most growth in time spent—strategy is definitely up there with games like, as I mentioned earlier, Last for Survival, White Out—they're both survival games—and, of course, Brawl Stars had a massive year in 2024 as well. Also, I think shooters interestingly saw a lot of interesting growth. It's a little bit surprising, but actually, people are spending a lot of time playing shooters. Also, simulation games and puzzle games saw a lot of growth this year as well in terms of time spent. And are there certain genres that have been losing engagement? Yeah. Unfortunately, I think sports is one that's been kind of down. I think this is what Sensor Tower data calls a product model more than a genre, but hyper-casual—I think people are gravitating more towards polished experiences in terms of engagement. And in genre, actually, geolocation saw some decline this year as well. So games like Pokémon Go and others—basically, the whole genre is one game.  Yeah. Basically, it is a pretty concentrated subject for sure. And when you're looking at the growth of different genres and the decline, are you seeing geographical differences here, like what is happening perhaps in the US compared to Korea and Japan? Yeah, I didn't dive in deep enough to look at the genres for each region, but yeah, we actually do see a decent amount of growth in a lot of these key regions. US—3% time spent increase, 6% sessions increase. Japan—7% time spent increase, 8% increase. Korea—it's more flat. But another interesting market to look at was India; it's one of the biggest growing places—11% time spent increase and 13% in sessions increase. So this is 2024 over 2023. Is there—do you feel that there's some kind of a max level of engagement? Because I feel like we're spending a lot of time on phones, and when you hear these numbers like 6% year-over-year, 8%, they are relatively small, but at the same time, like how much more time can we spend on devices? Oh yeah, there's got to be a limit for sure. But at the same time, I just anecdotally feel like there's—you know, people are spending a lot of time on things like entertainment and productivity. So there's always a fight for people's time, and while there's a limit for sure, I think that there's—you know, we can always try to take bigger pieces of the pie from other people as well.\n\nDamn. Okay. Well, that's interesting. Well, there's something else that I wanted to talk about. One of the things that I've been seeing on the rise is, of course, the rise of Hybrid Casual. And opening up this slide here that you had in the presentation is the rise of Hybrid Casual. What can you talk about this because we have been talking about Hybrid Casual since I think 2019, and now we're also talking about the death of hyper-casual, and now kind of everything is finally happening. It took us only like 5 years of saying this, and we're seeing almost like 40% growth of in-app purchase in Hybrid Casual games, and they feel like the future-proof model in a post-IDFA world because they combine the Monetization of both apps and ads, high marketability, and very wide appeal. So what can you talk about the Hybrid Casual's rising power? Yeah. You know, I wouldn't go so far as…\n\n\nTo say it's the real future-proof model. The market is always dynamic. Uh, and I think it still has ground to cover to really prove its place in the market. But it's pretty undeniable that I think the product model has seen a lot of growth in the past year and the past years. Um, one thing I would say though is, you know, like you mentioned, it's bringing a lot of lessons from other product models. Uh, so I would say that a lot of product models are—they're kind of like genres—are becoming a bit more fluid. I would say that people are taking lessons from other places and applying them in their games. You know, just like puzzle games introduced metagames and narratives. This year, those Forex games are taking lessons from casual games, and Hybrid Casual Games took lessons from, you know, all sorts of different other places. So, I think product models will continue to evolve and change over time. Hybrid casual is the newest evolution. Um, and maybe it'll face challenges, but I fully expect developers to iterate and adapt and overcome those challenges.\n\nWhen you're doing this taxonomy, um, it feels like Hybrid Casual Games are just becoming casual games. Like they might start with a little bit of a modest look and feel to them in terms of production values, uh, and maybe not so many robust meta mechanics, but after a while, like when you look at games like Magic Sword or others, it's like when—when is there a difference between a casual puzzle game and a Hybrid Casual Game? Like, how do you look at those?\n\nSure. Uh, so the way we define Hybrid Casual Games, uh, we say that they blend the kind of easy-to-understand active gameplay mechanics inherited from hyper-casual games. Uh, they add in simplified long-term meta features and retention strategies associated with midcore games. Uh, but maybe the easiest way to tell them apart is that they use a combination of, like, the in-app purchase revenue and ad revenue. So we typically would say maybe 50% of each. Uh, so whenever you're seeing a decent amount of ads, you know, rewarded ads, interstitials, whatever, that's probably going to be a Hybrid Casual Game as opposed to a casual game. And another way that we look at it is Hybrid Casual Games tend to have more generic assets. Uh, whereas casual games can definitely become more polished and a lot more—more work put into—more custom work put into what they put into the game.\n\nFor sure. Yeah. It's just interesting to see how this evolves because we are seeing, you know, top Hybrid Casual publishers—WooDoo, the Hom—you know, you name it—over the world finding hits that are making well above $100 million a year already in revenue, in purchase revenue. And so they are doubling down on those games and probably increasing production values to some extent, adding more metagame features, probably even skewing the revenue to getting, you know, 70% coming from the in-app purchase because the longer the player is in the game, the more important it is to make that game player monetize through in-app purchase because essentially the ads become useless. There you've already shown too many ads that there's no point showing ads for this one. This doesn't bring any revenue. So, I'm just always wondering when—when do we get to a point where Hybrid Casual is just the new casual?\n\nYeah, it's—it's definitely not a hard line, I would say. You know, 70%—which one is it—is a good question actually. And there are—I think there are games that actually have fully transitioned from being Hybrid Casual. They—they, you know, got the huge player base they were looking for that are really engaged and it just made more sense to just go full casual or full midcore actually in some cases. Uh, so I think it's interesting to have the hybrid. I think it's important to show the growth of Hybrid Casual Games. Uh, but also, yeah, I would definitely acknowledge the fact that these games don't necessarily stay Hybrid Casual their entire lives. And we actually—whenever we're looking at a taxonomy, we commonly look at games and say, \"Hey, is this actually still Hybrid Casual?\" And try to—try to stay abreast of those trends.\n\nOh, that's interesting. So you're transitioning off certain games off of the Hybrid Casual. So it kind of—that's you cut the most successful ones away. So the market size of Hybrid Casual almost stays the same because once they reach escape velocity, they just move to a puzzle or RPG category.\n\nYeah, we look at our definition of Hybrid Casual. If the game no longer fits that definition, then yeah, it makes sense to move it to a different definition that fits.\n\nBeautiful. And in the data, are you kind of like skewing towards the other direction? We're talking about the CPIs. We're talking about celebrity campaigns. We're talking about Jake Paul, or I was talking about Jake Paul. But um—um, I don't know why. Uh, but do you see—I was kind of combining these two. So do you see anything with people being anti-ads? Because in the latest Dream—you know, $50 million ad campaign—they had all these celebrities basically repeating the same USP, which is no ads. Yeah. Is that visible somewhere in the data that people hate ads?\n\nYeah. Yeah. This is something that I'd actually like to dive into a little bit more because there's—there's so much data in Sensor Tower; it's not easy to really dive in and see it all immediately. Um, we have a lot of really good ad data as well to look at for this. Uh, what I was immediately able to find was—looking at downloads for games with ad monetization are actually down past four quarters over the previous four quarters. Uh, although hyper-casual downloads are actually—you know, we're talking about—it's—it's kind of declining. Uh, downloads are actually up 2%, which is interesting to see. It's a goddamn cockroach to die. We'll be here after—after the apocalypse for sure. No, this is something that I've—I've noticed for—throughout the year. We're looking at, you know, new creatives that are able to get share a voice in all the different channels is that no ads, it…\n\n\nIt's a really common trend. You see this in a lot of different creatives, not just, you know, Dream Games, of course, is a huge example, but a lot of other creatives have been using this. So, there's definitely a large audience of people out there who just cannot stand ads and do not want to see them. At the same time, you know, Hybrid Casual Games have been seeing all this growth. There are a ton of games that do have ads. So, it's just a matter of, I think, segmenting your audience appropriately and saying, you know, \"these people hate ads. We can target them.\" And, you know, if you have a game that does have ads, you have to try to find the people that are okay with that.\n\nMhm. Interesting. Okay. And just as usual with data, it is some kind of a dichotomy where you have two things happening at the same time. So that's totally understandable.\n\nUm, well, switching gears and talking about Emerging Markets. So this is something that has been coming up a lot and, of course, it was in your Sensor Tower report. As we're looking for growth when looking at a market as a whole, quite often we're referencing growth pockets, and two of those growth pockets have been Latin America and the Middle East. We're referencing the numbers of fast in-app purchase growth in both, but when you put the actual dollar amount and make them visible, you actually understand that despite rapid growth—like in this case, the Middle East was growing almost 20% year-over-year, Latin America almost 15% year-over-year—nevertheless, the size of that market, so in the case of the Middle East, we're talking about a little bit over a billion, when North America is 28 billion and Europe is 12 billion. So, it is still tiny. You could dominate that market, and it's actually better to just be good in Western Europe.\n\nYeah, that's definitely a fair take. If you look at total sizes as you mentioned, it's not as big for sure. But I do think they're still worth paying attention to at some point if this growth continues year over year. These are very big populations. There's a lot of smartphone penetration in these places. There's a big focus, especially in the Middle East, on gaming. So if this continues to happen, then, you know, one day we're going to wake up and it's not going to be so tiny. So I definitely think it's worth paying attention to, and even now there can be opportunities. You can definitely find row-as-positive campaigns when executed effectively. So there's real potential for growth if approached strategically.\n\nYeah, and is there a significant difference like when we're talking about the size of the market? Where does it come from? Are those markets smaller? Let's say, in the case of the Middle East, is the ARPU still really high and comparable to the more advanced markets like North America and Europe, or is it population, or is it spending, or is it both?\n\nUh, yeah, ARPU is definitely not going to be as close to something like North America or the tier-one Asia regions for sure. But I think that also means that, you know, CPI is going to be low. There's going to be some less competition, and some of the top publishers out there have actually made major titles work in the region. I think PUBG is pretty big in the Middle East. Game of Sultans, and there are some APAC devs that really moved into Latin America, like Free Fire is in Brazil.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Who have been able to actually reach pretty significant scale while being, at the same time, sort of, you know, kings of the third world countries, yeah, or I think we're referencing them as the Global South or something; they keep changing the name, but not the three key markets, which are North America, Europe, and Asia, basically.\n\nYeah, absolutely. It's true. If you want to reach the biggest scales, those are the big three markets; they're just unavoidable for sure. But we do like to point out that there are opportunities in these smaller Emerging Markets, and they're worth paying attention to.\n\nYeah. And as you said, getting in there because it's cheaper, CPIs are lower, and then you can grow together with the market rather than fighting for the scraps in the existing market.\n\nFor sure. Yeah. I think that when it comes to almost anything in games, building up that proficiency over time, that knowledge of the market—you know, Scopely was working on IP games for years and they were making IP games with Hasbro for years before they created Monopoly Go. Another example that comes to mind is Love and Deep Space, which was created by Paper Games. They created these games for Asian women for years, and then they came out with this one that now is, I think, over like half of their revenue. It's a huge hit for them. So building up this proficiency and this specialization over time—if you think that these Emerging Markets are interesting and you know maybe they're going to be huge in the future, getting in now might be a good idea.\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by AppsFlyer.

Well, let's talk about the other Game Genres, like which ones are succeeding. So, sure. I'm just going to show—I think this one is correct. So, this one is the United States, and it is, I believe, this is revenue. So, Strategy, Puzzle, and Casino are bringing in the cash. What are we seeing in terms of the evolution of the market in the Western United States?\n\n\nStates are being sort of a representative. 60% of the Western market, yes, tier-one market. What have we been seeing in terms of how the revenue is being divided in purchase revenue amongst top genres on mobile? Yeah. Uh, so, as you mentioned, the casino puzzle is definitely still on top. So, you know, casino—we're seeing games like Monopoly Go, Coin Master, are doing—coin looters are really big for sure. Uh, puzzle, you know, the ever-present Royal Match and Candy Crush and all those different puzzle games are doing amazing. There actually, for growth though, um, I think strategy is seeing some of the most growth, even in the United States. So the games that I keep mentioning—Last Shelter: Survival, Brawl Stars, Whiteout Survival—and then the biggest launch of the year last year, Pokémon TCG Pocket. We've categorized those all under strategy, and it contributed to pretty significant growth in strategy in the US and globally last year. Um, yeah, car battlers, build and battle mobile. So basically Supercell, and then yeah, Car Battlers is Niantic, and then, of course, the Chinese Forex games for sure. Yeah. And then Century Games for Whiteout Survival. Uh, for puzzle, we did see the biggest growers: Match Factory, Royal Match, Gossip Harbor. So yeah, the merge games are still doing really well. Royal Match is still really doing really well. And some of these more hybrid casual games, like Match Factory. It's interesting. We're seeing a lot of the casual publishers actually branching out into hybrid casual and seeing a lot of success there as well.\n\nAnd what happened to RPGs? Like I felt like just a few years ago everybody was playing RPGs. Like you had Marvel, you got Star Wars, you got AFK Arena, Shadow Legends; it was AFK Journeys and so forth. It was like the genre to be in, and it feels like they have been declining, right? It does. Yeah. It's definitely something that we have seen a decline in. RPGs, as well as tabletop and sports, were three genres in the US that have been seeing decline in the past year. Uh, as for what's behind that, uh, I don't have any specific Sensor Tower data to back this up. Um, but I feel like a lot of other genres have been taking what made RPGs successful and applying it in their genres and making it, uh, you know, all the strategy games I just mentioned; a lot of them have these like gotcha kind of elements that really allowed RPGs to monetize so well. Uh, and they do a lot of things that RPGs haven't done yet. Uh, they're able to capture a younger audience by having more bite-sized engagement. You can just play these—you know, Pokémon TCG Pocket; you can log in for five minutes twice a day, and that's good enough for sure. And they have all the thrill of a gotcha game while, you know, they have the unique advantage of their nostalgia for all the Millennials, of course. Um, but this is something that a lot of the RPGs—they want to monopolize all your time. I feel like they want to—they have so much to do in these games. Uh, so yeah, I feel like a lot of players are getting fatigued whenever they see an RPG and they think, \"Oh, this is going to take up all my time. Why should I give them all my time?\"\n\nAnd you mentioned the subgenres like the Forex strategies and match swaps are dominating on the revenue side, but, you know, how niche should the developers think about going when they look at all the subgenres? There's plenty, and of course, the Sensor Tower tool is amazing in seeing all the smallest subgenres and how they're evolving. But what's your suggestion? Like, how niche should a developer look when choosing a genre? Is it better to look at something that is smaller and kind of perhaps insignificant for many? Or is it better to look at something that is large, like strategy, like slots, like match swap, and try to take a small piece out of that? Yeah. Yeah. It's always kind of a fine balance, right? Trying to understand your audience size and get that innovative gameplay that'll get a really niche audience—super engaged—and will spend a lot of time and money in your game. Uh, you know, the problem is, of course, the more niche you go, the smaller the audience. Uh, but I think in this post-IDFA world, it's kind of difficult to find niche audiences. Uh, there are ways you can get creative, but uh, what I would say is I think it's—you can try to target a niche, try to target this audience with high LTVs, but make sure that your audience is broad enough for you to find them and get them in the game. Uh, so you know, all these games that I constantly talk about—yeah, Last Shelter: Survival; it's a 4X strategy game, which is traditionally—it's hard to get people involved in these games because there's so much going on in them. You know, there's 10 different systems and progressions and all these things to keep track of, but they get people in the game with these more arcade-style ads. Uh, they have a really slick, 2-year-like task system that lets people know exactly what they're supposed to do when. So being able to take these steps—you know, things like IP—to get people into the game and get that reach uh can allow people to find that balance between niche and audience size.\n\nAnd is it so that—I mean, on the other hand, when you think about it, the more competitive a genre you choose, the larger genre you choose, the hotter—the bigger the LTVs will be. So the more you have to actually focus on monetization and live ops and innovating on your marketability to bring down the CPI. So it's kind of like—it's tough. In order to enter a big market that is growing, like match, like strategy, you have to have quite the operational model to even take a small piece. And at the same time, if you don't do that, then you're relegated to a niche genre where yes, the…\n\n\nEntry might be easier. Um, you might be able to establish a certain type of position, but even being a notable player in that niche genre is still a very small—not always very small. It's still a limited amount of revenue. Yeah. It's a challenge for sure. I think these high LTV players, they're harder to find. They're more expensive to acquire. They're going to have high standards; they want to commit all their time and money. So developing games for them is going to be expensive as well. Uh, so yeah, it's definitely true. I think targeting and keeping these players is a high-roller's game, and spending money is no guarantee that you're going to get them either. It's definitely a challenge, and I don't have any easy answers for that, for sure.\n\nAnd I think it just plays out with the whole—I mean, you were helping us to get the data for the annual predictions, and part of them is something that I like to look at: the new games being launched since 2012 every year. And again, we're just hitting new record lows. The amount of new games is lower than it was in 2012, which is when Sensor Tower started pulling the data and basically we got the first free-to-play games in. So, it feels like there's less and less games coming out because it's just so challenging to establish a foothold in a mature market. So, you just can't launch that many games.\n\nYeah. There are so many amazing games out there, and if you want to stand out and take a place, you have to be really high quality as well. It's difficult; it's a risk as well, right? Even if you create something that you think is great, the market might disagree. Yeah, it could be a better product, but actually, I don't know. It's kind of hard to say because if somebody has been on the market for years, they just have such an extensive amount of content and such an audience base that nobody will leave to play your game that might be, you know, better production value or more interesting theme, but essentially the same experience. Like you're launching a new shooter. Okay, what do you have? Okay, it's like the same game but significantly less content. And I kind of have to start from the beginning, and I don't have my social graph here, so that everything plays together, and so we end up in a place where we have older and older games, but then again these games have almost an infinite amount of content because of the live-op investments that the companies have been doing.\n\nFor sure. I think—I don't know—I go in and open Candy Crush, and it looks a little bit dated to me, but it's still doing amazing. These players clearly love this game, and they love this experience, and they just keep going back, right? Yeah. Switching costs are really high, and so because of that you have to be innovative both on marketing and absolutely design.\n\nFascinating. Well, another thing that is growing when looking at the market is, of course, the Gen Z audience. So we had Tobias from Google, and he talked about the Gen Z audience, and he talked about that this year, actually, the Gen Z audience will be the largest spending audience on mobile. Um, can you talk a little bit about designing for Gen Z because you had this interesting graph in your report?\n\nFor sure. Yeah, it's—whenever we're talking about Gen Z, I think it's good to take some lessons from even outside of gaming, maybe from TikTok, that app you guys might have heard of. One thing I think people have learned from TikTok, of course, is that making things snackable—making just the small time investment for players—is going to make it more palatable for Gen Z, for sure. So, make it snackable, something that will continually capture their attention, something new and interesting. Another thing that I think that Gen Z players enjoy is social elements. So, making it social with things like PvP, co-op, guilds, being able to message each other and help each other. If all your players are, or if all your friends are playing this game with you, I think you're much more likely to retain in Gen Z, or actually any generation, honestly. The last thing that really comes to mind is kind of a modern style, hitting a tone that resonates with Gen Z. They're, for better or worse, not looking to play Solitaire on their Windows 98. They have younger tastes in terms of art, music, dialogue, tone, and hitting those tastes is a good way to attract these players.\n\nWhat's the typical Gen Z taste? Because it feels like all the companies, when you say Gen Z, they're like, \"Okay, so you want a purple-haired girl with a cyber tone.\" Like, is that what we're going for?\n\nUh, yeah. I mean, there's some of that for sure. I don't know. I'm a little bit hesitant to try to put on my opinion. I'm actually in the generation above Gen Z, so I'm afraid of showing my knowledge on Gen Z. But yeah. Okay. I don't know much about specifics, but just in general. Yeah. Trying to target them is in this way.\n\nI'm just curious because like I get immediately like, \"This is not for me,\" but then I get so many of these games that look exactly the same. It's like, okay, now she has pink hair. Now she has like a '80s vibe, but then again with a little bit of a cyber punk and everything just looks so generic. It's almost like they ask AI, \"Can you make this character Gen Z?\" It's like, \"Say no more. Have shaven head, purple hair on the side, web stores.\" You've seen what good looks like, but have you seen great? App charge is the direct-to-consumer platform backed by\n\n\nThe likes of Supercell and built by monetization pros from Moonactive, Platika, Huge Games, and others. People who know the difference. App Charge powers over half a billion dollars in transactions a year for top studios, optimizing every detail. Deeply personalized web store offers, custom-made design, industry-leading monetization features, in-game payments SDK, and more. 70% of top-grossing games already have a web store, but the ones scaling fastest are doing it with App Charge. Learn more at appcharge.com.\n\nLittle gun here, big shoes. It's like, come on.\n\nI'm like, do they even like this? Okay. Well, that's interesting. Another targeting that you had in the presentation was for gender targeting.\n\nHere. So, here I have it. And then gender target development. Yes or no? This is interesting. So, you have gender breakdown by genre and you have age breakdown by genre.\n\nYeah. Uh, so we're looking at this. Sorry, I need to make this a little bit bigger on my screen.\n\nYeah, no worries. We're seeing, in the United States, no surprise, puzzle lifestyle games; lots of women playing those games. On the other side of the board, sports and strategy games are a lot more male-dominated. Interestingly, some of the top strategy games that grew in the past year are a little bit more well-balanced than this chart would suggest. So, it's whether you should target a single gender or not. The sad answer is that it's complicated and it depends because there are definitely games out there that are really focused on a single gender. Brawl Stars, for the past quarter in the US, is about 88% men. So Brawl Stars is all about getting men in their game and boys.\n\nLast War is like 77% males. On the other side, Love and Deep Space, the interactive story game for women, is 84% women. But then there are also games that are a little bit more well-balanced. Royal Match is 64% women, which is balanced, but there's a decent amount of men playing this game, too. White Out Survival is 54% men and 46% women. So, that much in a 4X game.\n\nYeah, it really surprised me as well, especially compared to Last War. I didn't have a chance to dig into this more deeply, but I think it's really interesting that even in the same genre, you can find games that are able to target both genders or a single gender.\n\nThis is interesting because when you say genre targeting and gender targeting development, I'm thinking about games like the Space Ape game, Chrome Valley Customs. The hypothesis was clear: we're going to make a puzzle game—everybody loves puzzles—mostly 60/40, and then we're going to make it for dudes because it's going to be all about fixing cars. I believe Hutch made a similar type of game, Forza, a puzzle game with cars, something like that, I think with Forza IP. And both, I believe, tanked.\n\nYeah. And so I had this, and again it's just like because you see the market as a whole. I see individual games. I'm like, I don't know if that's the best way to go, but you're saying like, no, actually it is. There have been cases like White Out Survival where you're making a 4X game and half of the audience could be women.\n\nIt's apparently it happens. It's definitely a welcome surprise for me, too. Those two games that you mentioned specifically, I don't know; maybe it didn't work out for them. Chrome Valley Customs did pretty well for a while, but it's maybe a little bit less promising at the moment. Another game I did look at that's kind of similar is Century Games' Truckstar.\n\nYes, true, true. Century Games is a 4X developer. Yes. They actually made this Truckstar game, another male-focused puzzle game, and I think it's still doing quite well, maybe about 2 million per month since October 2024, something like that. For a puzzle game, that's kind of… that's puzzle.\n\nIt's better than the other two. Yeah. And for the other two, if some game is doing okay and then it kind of goes down after that, it's basically that they were trying to figure it out with CPIs and the ROAS, and they were kind of overspending, and at some point they're like, \"Guys, we can't do this anymore,\" and the whole game kind of deflates immediately.\n\nYeah. That story tracks, huh? Yeah. But they were good games. Couldn't care less about fixing cars, I'll be honest. Sounds like, again, like maybe as much as Gen Z would care about a purple-haired girl, and this is how much I, as a male, care about fixing cars.\n\nYeah. I don't know about you, but might be a fantasy for somebody else. It's not one that particularly targets me, but I guess a lot of people like fixing cars.\n\nFixing cars. I just love fixing trucks so much. Yeah. I want to do it all day. I'm a man. I need to fix trucks.\n\nHere's another interesting graph that you had: quality over quantity in new launches. This is kind of going through the number of new releases. And what you have here is not only the decreasing amount, though the decrease has significantly slowed down since 2020, but we're also seeing what genres have been coming out. So 2020, 2021 seemed to be the year of…\n\n\nPuzzle. Uh, 2024 again, more puzzle games. Uh, but what can you talk about the type of genres that are coming out and how companies are thinking about new game launches?\n\nUh, sorry, I don't recall having to prepare for this question. No worries. Uh, let me, uh, yeah, we'll just remove this. But I can ask you about this. So, the new game launches are decreasing, but there's success of titles like Pokémon TCG Pocket that shows that fresh hits are still possible.\n\nSure. Uh, so my question is more like what is the time a successful game these days spends in soft launch compared to what it was just a few years ago? So, has the time in soft launch decreased or increased? Uh, from what I saw after pulling it, it looks like it's been increasing actually. Uh, I think developers are really trying to make sure that their games are ready to go for the most part, at least on average. Uh, maybe not every developer, but Supercell probably releasing just out of pocket all the time.\n\nYeah. But uh, on average, looking across the market, I think successful games that have been seeing a decent per-month revenue rate have been trying to spend more time in soft launch, trying to hit those KPIs and make sure that they're ready for the market. Um, the average that I've managed to pull for these more successful games was actually 200 days, which is higher than I expected. Um, I think it might be skewed by some outliers there. Uh, yeah, it's definitely been getting longer over time, from what I can see.\n\nAnd what about IPs? Is there more IP that you're seeing already with new games coming in, or is the IP trend more around scaling games when they are already live?\n\nNo, there's definitely been a lot of IP games being launched. I think I took a look at, for games launched in the past four quarters, 20% of the top 10 had an IP, 19% of the top 100, and only 5% of the top 10,000. So, I guess that's also a factor of, you know, if you're not one of these big bets, you're probably going to have a harder time having an innate IP in your game. Uh, but I think that there's a lot of, yeah, there are a lot of games that are seeing IPs in their launches. There are also IP collabs that have been really popular as well. I think, out of these top 10 launches, 30% of them—three of them—had IP collabs with them already. Uh, which is really interesting to see as well.\n\nSo, you said 90% of the games in the top 100 have an IP. Sorry. 19. I was like, \"Yeah, because 90…\" I think that's the Korean market where it was 90%. I remember something like that—like 90% of all the new games being downloaded have an IP, and that was already several years ago, and it felt like, you know, our markets are, even though we think we're very advanced, but really it is the probably the Korean and the Japanese markets that are the most advanced in terms of Mobile Gaming. China as well. So, it feels like we're trailing towards that direction where it's IP or bust.\n\nYeah. Yeah, it could be. You definitely saw a lot of IP games launching in the east. Uh, there was a Solo Leveling game. I think there's a Jiu-Jitsu Kaisen. A lot of these like anime kind of games. I think a lot of success over there. Um, you know, loves anime. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to be too generalizing, but I think that's definitely fair to say. Um, to see, you know, even games that have traditionally not been super, or maybe even try to build their own IP. So, like Honkai: Star Rail has a collab with Fate/Stay Night, which is really interesting to see considering that Fate is one of their biggest competitors on mobile with Fate/Grand Order. Uh, yeah, it's, uh, yeah, definitely I think it's interesting to see we're trending in that direction with the Pokémon releases this year and all the IP collabs.\n\nWell, last graph that I have here is about market concentration. And this is again a really interesting one. This is something that I like to look at with all the graphs whenever analyzing the markets—not only the growth or decline of downloads and revenue, but I really like to see what's the level of concentration because I feel like if the top two titles are taking 70% or more of the overall revenue, it's kind of almost impossible to break through. It couldn't happen, but it's just like it means that the audience is already being taken.\n\nYeah. Yeah, it's definitely tough to break in there. That's a trend that I've seen over time—for the most part, if there's a single, you know, or a couple of games taking up a large percentage of these genres or subgenres. Uh, a lot of times it's going to actually increase over time. So, I actually dove in a little bit deeper. These, we're looking at genres right here. I started looking at some subgenres specifically. So, Roblox is a subgenre. Sandbox, for all time, their in-app purchase concentration is 80%. For the past four quarters, it's 89%. So, it's actually increased over time. Uh, other sandboxes haven't really been able to compete on that front. Although, to be fair, Minecraft is still seeing a ton of engagement. It's just maybe the product model there that doesn't drive as much in that purchase model as the model play. Uh, for other subgenres, you know, Clash of Clans, uh, for the past four quarters, 81% market concentration, all-time 70%. People have tried to come in and dethrone them for over a decade now, and it's just not happening, right? Um, but there are some interesting counter examples. Not many, but some. I think the biggest one that comes to mind is Monopoly Go.\n\n\nSensor Tower, we—true, true. That's a good example, right?  Yeah. Coin Master in 2022 had 83% of the market.  Uh, and then in the past four quarters, Monopoly Go has 58%. So, they're able to come in and take a lot of that market share. Interestingly though, Coin Master is doing just fine. It seems that Monopoly Go more expanded the subgenre than took share away from the others.\n\nThat's a very interesting analysis, actually. So, when looking at a highly concentrated market, it's not the strategy to come in and try to take audience from the existing players who have already cemented their position, but it's more of a question: Can you expand this market? Is this still a very profitable niche that could be twice as big if we just come in and bring in more accessibility, more relevance to it by having perhaps the right type of IP? That's an interesting take. Yeah. I think that's a really interesting insight that you can see across all the other examples as well.  Is there a data point that could show you that this is a market that can be expanded in terms of audience?  Whether a market can be expanded or not. Yeah. Like, how does Scopely—let's give them the benefit of the doubt because they're a smart organization—and they looked at Coin Master (Moon Active) just printing money and they're like, \"We've got to get in; we've got to get a piece of this one,\" and they figured, \"If we bring in the world's most famous tabletop game and we marry it with the exact same mechanics\"—not saying that they copied it, but definitely got inspired by them—and now they've expanded the market because they brought in a lot of new players.  Yeah. It's tough to say that there's a data point that can point to that. You know, all historical data doesn't include any innovation, anything new you're going to do isn't included in that, right? So it's hard to say that Coin Master was very different from all these other close-to-monopolies that I've mentioned just now.  And I'm not going to recommend anyone go after Clash of Clans or Roblox. Many have tried with IPs. Absolutely. It's tough to say there's a specific data point in there. I think it might become more qualitative than that—of like, where is the innovation? What's the new take? Where is the audience going? What's going to hook them? What's the new take that's going to drive the market expansion?\n\nWell, let me know if you find that data point. Don't let anybody else know. I'll just keep using it in our consulting.
