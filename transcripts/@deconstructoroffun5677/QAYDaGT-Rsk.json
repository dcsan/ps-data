  "cleanText": "[Music]\nSaad Hameed, CEO and founder of Game District. I'm so glad to have you on the podcast. Finally.\nThank you so much, Michail. I am honored to come on this podcast. This is one of the podcasts we have been listening to for a very long time, and there were founders coming from around the world. We just thought, okay, this is amazing. I can't tell you how good I'm feeling right now. I wanted to tell you the story about Game District in Pakistan because I podcast during the last couple of years is about the ecosystem around the world and telling the stories about the founders and also telling the right stories about the ecosystem.\nSo, I'm really excited.\nI'm honored. We've met in Abu Dhabi, and I know a little bit about Lahore. Sorry, Lahore, you're in Lahore. I know a little about Game District, and can you just tell more people about Game District because you have like 15 studios, right?\nI think I wanted to tell a really small and easy story for Game District. One of the funny things is that when we developed Game District, our idea was to develop districts, so different districts. At that time, I didn't know about the story of Supercell, so it's kind of like Supercell and Game District have the same kind of metaphor. These districts are cells, where teams are actually doing their games independently, and they have full authority of developing games and everything. But the difference is Finland has a really developed culture and mindset of developing games. On the other side, Pakistan has this hit-and-trial method to grow. That's why, other than that, the full anatomy of autonomously growing strategy of Supercell to developing games, we have some controls. These controls are only because the founders or the teams don't make mistakes. This is the philosophy why we have it because it's a bootstrap company. We have never raised any capital. So we need to wash over feeds, like what's going here and what's going there. Our strategy is simple. During this period, we have really top teams, which we call the scale team, which are right now in the phase of scaling. Then we have a team which is still learning how to scale. There are a couple of problems, either on the scaling side, on the execution side, or on the innovation side. Then on the third tier, most of our teams are actually a part of an incubation process where they understand how the Game District game industry works, what are the key KPIs of Game District, and everything, and how this layer actually works. So you get into the incubation, get into the mid-zone, and then you go into the scaling teams, and then the world is yours. That's the strategy Game District has been doing.\nThe funnier and very interesting part is whenever I'm just meeting with all the founders and everything, everyone has a similar kind of story, but in their own colors. You talk with either in Europe with Boom Bits and everything, and they say, okay, we have the same story. You study about Supercell, they have a similar story, but in different colors. I think it's very beautiful that how all the founders think about the same in the mobile industry. We are doing the same. The why was very different at Game when we started Game District, and now we are actually at par where we are developing the vision and the big statement about Game District, how we wanted to carry on this mission for the next decade. So that's about Game District. Other than that, in terms of numbers, we have around 3 plus billion downloads all over. We still have 22 million daily active users, around 250 million plus monthly active users. So that's a little bit about Game District and how we are operating.\nHow many people do you have working for games?\nWe have 400 plus people right now working.\nWe also have an office in a small office in China and also a really nice office in Istanbul. So we are really connected with around the world. We know what is the beauty of each ecosystem and how we can take things from them. One of my very favorite things, I wanted to mention, is one of the quotes from Shaquille O'Neal. Someone asked Shaquille O'Neal, what is the best thing about you? He said, I'm the best thief. He said, what do you mean? He said, I'm the best thief. When I see someone and I see that he's better than me, I steal from him, put it in my mind, and just play with that. He said, in my career, I see Michael Jordan, I see Muhammad Ali, I see Magic Johnson, I just steal everything from them. So I think for us also, it's very similar. When we see Turks, they're amazing. When we see Chinese, they are crazy good. So we just take everything from them, putting it into the Pakistani mindset, and want to build the best of the best.\nI love it. Imitation is the best form of flattery, as they say. Yeah, 100%.\nAnd so, talking about your company and Pakistan, you're the biggest game developer in Pakistan in publishing.\nWe are now the biggest. I hope there would be a lot of others. But the whole ecosystem is magical. The thing is, there's a lot of other companies, a lot of companies, and they are all on the way of what Game District has done.\nToday's podcast is brought to you by Absfly, inviting you to dive into their new first-of-its-kind report, the state of creative optimization 2025 edition. It's not about how to make creatives. It's about understanding what makes users actually stop scrolling and what emotional and psychological triggers drive performance. Based on over a million creative variations and nearly $2.5 billion dollars in ad spend, the insights in the report will help you develop a winning creative strategy. Check out the link in the podcast description below or go to appslar.com and search the state of creative optimization. That's appslar.com.\nAnd there are many ways to go here. Like, one, when you were talking about these, well, your studio is going basically from incubation to mid-zone or production into scaling and having these almost like gates and a little bit more control than a typical cell structure. Of course, cell structure works when your company has billions in the bank. You can afford to make years of mistakes, and that won't even hurt you in any way. But when you're bootstrapped and you're coming out of nowhere and just getting to that scale, you can't take too many losses because then it will be too bad.\nBut it's an interesting point of Pakistan because not too many know about Pakistan's ecosystem, but those who know know it's up and coming. Pakistan and Vietnam are the ecosystems that people are talking about are rising. People have played games that come out of Pakistan a lot, not knowing, like Hexosord, for example, my favorite puzzle game for the last two and a half years.\nSo can you talk about what's driving the rise of gaming studios in Pakistan right now?\nI'll tell you a little story which I always like to talk about. There are always two sides of an ecosystem to grow. One is the divine, and one is the cerebral success this ecosystem creates. When it comes to the divine success, Pakistan got it before anyone else in the industry when it comes to mobile games. Back in 2010, a Pakistani studio made a game called Tapfish. It was huge. It was the era of Angry Birds. But the thing is, the Finnish ecosystem used Angry Birds and developed the whole industry. It's phenomenal. On the other side, the Pakistani, the unfortunate thing for Pakistan, this divine success was never able to create a whole big industry. The thing is, this game sells by Dena. The studio is acquired by Dena, and then the founders actually flew out of Pakistan, and then the industry is barren and at the back foot. If you see after Flappy Birds or all the industry grew up, that's the first thing about Pakistan. But at the same time, what happened was it was the first ignition of taking things forward in the mobile industry, and the small studios stood up, and they were starting to work at a really big IT workforce in Pakistan.\nPakistan mostly, Pakistani studios started as a games-as-a-service-based model. They just started working for the other companies of the world, and then they understood the ASOS and developing everything, and then getting in there, but there were no solid studios actually started.\nThere were a couple of studios, I would say, Mindstorm is one of them, then Ozie Technologies, and some other studios who actually worked in 2014 and 15. Janiah teams also doing really good at that time. But that was the first part of the game development studios. I always say that the first era of mobile game developers always make less money than the second or the third era because there was no monetization, no great ad networks, and everything during the 2014 and 15 period. At that time, we, with my co-founder, I have a company, and we used to do services and little games for ourselves. In 2015, I got a chance to work very closely with a Y Combinator's founders and understand the Y Combinator's whole philosophy, how they bring these things and build it to billions of dollars. I thought it would be really interesting if we create this Y Combinator model, which eventually became the district model, and then I got to know it's a cell model also, and give the teams the right choices to make the games and just give them the right support when it comes to the top and just tell them to do what they are best in. That's the model I've just brought on board with one of my best friends or my class fellow from class 4th, Ahmed, and we started Game District in 2016, late, probably 17 early, and then we thought, okay, let's do it. The only thing that we hired these team leads, or we just bring them from our team and give them the authority to develop their games and just give them the right nurturing to develop it, what to do, what not to do, and the vibe was amazing. We were a small team, sat late at night, and ate food together and everything. The Game District's first phase of Game District is all live on the wipe side. I was listening to your podcast with the Turkish founders, where the Gram game founders have made 30 prototypes in two weeks. We were the same. We were crushing it. The rate was crazy. We were just doing a lot of prototypes and developing in one week, launching it on Friday, then you get back on, see the results on Monday, and it was a crazy time. Over the period of time, slowly and slowly, we are moving hit and trial, hit and trial, a lot of mistakes, a lot of understanding. We started to develop and able to understand the whole blueprint of how the mobile game industry works.\nWhy are we unique? I would say there has never been a gaming company or a proper gaming studio working in Pakistan before. For example, if you take the example of Vietnam, Vietnam used to have Ubisoft and all of these studios in there from 15 years. India has Zynga from the last 15 years. Turkey does have some studios also. Pakistan is one of the very crazy ecosystems where there was never a proper gaming company, an international gaming company, has been established. Our model was hit and trial. We just hit and trial, hit and trial, and take things forward. I think the right way of doing in the gaming vocabulary, we're doing everything, testing, testing, and testing, and learning through testing also. So that's about the Pakistani gaming ecosystem. We have companies like Mindstorm who deliver this ha puzzle for Line Studios. They work very close with Line Studio, and then Overgame Supermarket, which is one of the top leading games publishing from Pakistan. Other than that, we do have a really nice IP. It's called Scary Teacher, one of the very famous IP characters on YouTube and everything is also developed in Pakistan also.\nMhm. So, just like any ecosystem, there has to be some kind of a first ignition or a spark that's the spark of success. Somebody does something, and others are like, hey, I could be doing that. So the first founder set up the successful game, sell it, leave it, kind of like don't leave anything to grow upon, but their example of finding success is the most important thing, not even them investing back to that. That would have been great, but just that they showed that you can find success relatively fast in this thing called mobile gaming gave a spark to others. Then you talked about the talent that Pakistan has. So just before the recording, because we're kind of like talking about, in Europe, there's nothing about Pakistan. It's not an area that we would\n\n\nI have a lot of news, and we only have news whenever Pakistan is tied to India. Then, usually, there is a comparison of India and Pakistan. Pakistan is so much smaller than India. We were just talking about it, but so much smaller is like 300 million people, which is more than three times larger than Turkey. So it is a very big country in all the means. It is known for IT talent, and that, of course, gives you the workforce. Especially if you're finding success in gaming, then the best of the workforce turns towards gaming because not only is there success, but it's also much more fun to develop games than B2B SaaS or whatever cloud computing for big companies.\n\nI think I agree with you. So Pakistan has been given the stigma that we are a small country, but in reality, we are a really big country. The thing is, every founder or friends coming from anywhere in the world, once they come to Pakistan, they have become ambassadors of Pakistan, I would say that. Because the thing is, we are different, but we are very unique in our own way. So that's one of the things. But other than that, you're very right that we have great universities. We still think that a lot more things can be done in Pakistan, but we still have really good universities, and we have been producing really good IT talent and one of the best IT talent with very good English speaking skills and everything. It's very unique in the world. Then, all of these Gen Zs in the world right now, for them, working in a SaaS-based product or enterprise software is not fun, where a gaming company and developing games and running the character you have just developed or something is more fun. So I think it's a great advantage for anyone in Pakistan. The only difference we feel right now is the difference between the institutes or academia and the industry. Any person who graduated, he is probably a great computer engineer or something, but he's lacking the grit of a game developer or something. That's why three years back, we started a program called Pixel. The Pixel program is one of the very unique programs at Game District, where we, after the graduation, give them a chance to build their skills according to the industry standards. So they got to know about the retentions and what the right execution of a game would be and everything. This is the program we have been really passionate about, and every year we are doing from 50 to 100 guys getting in there, and they just polish their skills. So it's not only related to game development, it's related to game design and related to video editing because creatives are going to be the big thing. We are just doing all the roundups and doing this from the last three years, and it's been really phenomenal for us.\n\nWeb stores. You've seen what good looks like, but have you seen great? Appcharge is the direct-to-consumer platform backed by the likes of Supercell and built by monetization pros from Moon Active, Platika, Huge Games, and others. People who know the difference. Appcharge powers over half a billion dollars in transaction a year for top studios, optimizing every detail. Deeply personalized web store offers, custom-made design, industry-leading monetization features, in-game payments SDK, and more. 70% of top-grossing games already have a web store, but the one scaling fastest, they're doing it with Appcharge. Learn more at appcharge.com.\n\nHuh. How about, because you said in the beginning there were not a lot of gaming companies? Now there are more gaming companies, and then, of course, the way you're building your company is pretty perfect to spawn more game companies because of that autonomy approach. What's the situation with publishers and Venture Capital? Because I know that there's tons of publishers. Google always invites me every year to do an event in Lahore, but it's always in July when I can't come. I know a lot of publishers have been asking if I would come with them, like hybrid casual publishers, so they definitely are investing into the region and investing into the games, investing into the talent. But how about Venture Capital? Is that still there?\n\nI think I need to tell two or three things here, which I wanted to tell with this podcast to all my Pakistani founders also. Pakistan has been very unfortunate when it comes to the wishes of the world. They are looking at Pakistan as a growing market, and that's because they think that other SaaS companies or fintech companies would be really interested to do VC. We see are working on that side. Even the VCs who are working in Pakistan, I have talked to them a lot of times. They don't think gaming as a business because it's an entertainment business. It's a hit-and-trial method. Again, not all of your shots would be moonshots, and that's why they are a little reluctant. But at the same time, I would say that any gaming VCs would come here, there would be a big queue of developers who would be looking forward for even the smaller chat tax to build something really, really fancy out of Pakistan. That's the one thing.\n\nThe second thing where I think a lot of work can be done is the credit facilities for the UA. A lot of game developers have been working in Pakistan. They are always chasing the cash. So they don't have the right amount of money to spend on their games, and then the problems start happening. There are two or three ways why they are failing. The first thing is they are not amazing when it comes to the UA and monetization, but they're great in terms of making games. So there's a huge opportunity when there is a game which scaled. The western studios see that, and they see it's a great potential for them to improve the monetization and improve the UA, and they can just take it to the moon, and then they buy the games from them for really good things. That is one of the missing parts in the whole ecosystem: the right monetization, the right UA, and the right kind of economy for the games. If everything is fixed, we have a huge problem with the credit facilities in Pakistan. So any company who can provide credits to the UA, it would be amazing, and this ecosystem could ignite 10x. That would be a problem from which I think from the Pakistani perspective could be solved by the international VCs or companies, and the ecosystem can grow 10-20x easy in the next couple of years.\n\nIf I understood this correctly, the issue is not the talent. You have plenty. It's not the issues of previous success because there's some massive heads being launched, even though they've been published by others. And that's where it gets into. So the issue is more on the capital side. So there's no gaming VCs investing into Pakistan, which is wild because there's gaming VCs in India, which is right next to you, and in Turkey, and in Israel, and in every other place, and they still don't come where you are, despite the growing potential and not just the potential, but the evidence of growth. And then, because of that, there's not too many new companies being launched because there's not that early funding that they would need to go from a seed stage to actually shipping their products. Then, when it comes to scaling, even when these smaller studios are able to ship a game that shows a lot of promise, they don't have access to the capital to scale it. There are two types of access to scale capital. You can get a VC to scale, which is, to be honest, not the most efficient way of scaling because you're giving away equity for money to scale what you already have, rather than scale your company. The other part is what we have right now is, of course, UA scaling. So there's plenty of different companies there, whether we're talking about Medicica or PVX partners or some other ones that I'm just blanking on. Has UA financing been part of this in any way?\n\nWe have not been any, we don't have a need of UA financing till now. But as I said, UA financing is one part. So most of the companies will need UA financing. But you just mentioned Meta, and I was mentioning that there are a couple of companies who are helping the whole ecosystem like crazy. Google has been instrumental about the whole ecosystem, the way they have discovered this ecosystem, started building this in a very unique way, helping the founders to grow, telling them they are not lesser than any other founders. So that's been amazing. Then, I think Applovin has been instrumental also. They've just been working really closely with the top studios and telling them the world is yours. You can grow as much as you want. That's the Applovin thing. Then a lot of other companies we worked with, like Finnish companies and companies from around the world. We have been working with Metrica. You just mentioned their name, and they have been instrumental. So the biggest problem for us is monetization. How to understand the numbers, which we have never been able to use because the founders are always gritting on the side of developing great products, executing the best way, and there's a huge margin around the game, which you wanted to unlock, but you wanted to unlock in an easier way. So there would be a couple of companies where you go, and they say, \"Okay, do this, do that,\" and the founders get out of that motivation, and they say, \"Okay, I don't want that extra 15-20%.\" But where we have been working with Metrica, they had really simple integrations, a very hands-on team. They have been instrumental. The guys came to Pakistan. Also, one of the co-founders, Justin, came to Pakistan.\n\nOh yeah, they have been helping us a lot, a lot of good. Then they have also been moving towards, because I've been talking with them, and they're listening all the time. I told them Pakistan is one of the fastest-growing gaming markets where all the Europeans are looking for growth. Pakistan is the fastest growing, and the thing is, I told them, build these UA facilities, and there would be a humongous Pakistani studios coming to you, and the numbers would be maximized because the games are there, the numbers are there, it's just right mediation, right monetization and UA, and then the US spending facilities. If these three things can be fixed, it would be a humongously huge train for the Pakistani gaming ecosystem.\n\nThat's crazy. Yeah, because you've gotten to this point without essentially any external capital.\n\nNo, we, we, I think there is, there is no company in Pakistan who is in mobile games, and they have raised any capital. I don't know them. I don't know any.\n\nAnd how are you approaching? So you talked about monetization and UI. How are you approaching monetization and publishing in Pakistan? Are the games made for low ARPU markets, which is, you know, the global south, or are the games made already to cater basically the tier one western markets and so forth, like high ARPU audiences?\n\nSo Misha, I would say that right now, this is a transition period of the whole ecosystem. So for us, we always thought this tier two, tier three makes a lot of sense, and the reason is the amount of capital we need. We need a faster ROI. That's a very simple equation: you need, you put money today, $1 today, and you wanted to get 1.50 or 1.20 by the end of 10 days or 15 days. That's the only way you can manage your cash flow. But the thing is, with this dynamic changes in the mobile game industry, because after two, three months, everything has changed, we got to know that if we wanted to build really world-class products, and we wanted to retain them for a very longer period of time, we wanted to spend, we wanted to spend at the par where we have a little longer break, human window, we can get the right games and build them, and then at the time, we will be making money from those games from the next couple of years. So this is a transition period of the whole gaming ecosystem in Pakistan and especially for Game District also. For that reason, we need to learn a lot of things. We need to get our monetizations fixed down, using our tools and our brain on each player and able to understand how one player can give a lot of benefit to you and doing a lot of testing. So for this reason, as I told, we got some hires also, X Triple Dot and X guys who just know what the monetization is or what the UA is actually. So we admire a couple of companies, and Triple Dot is one of them, how they take the users and everything. So I was just, like, almost sometime, I talk with my co-founder, I said, \"We do, you know, the fun part is, we almost have the same kind of monthly active users as Triple Dot.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nBut in terms of revenue, we are not even the size of 10% of.\n\n\nA triple dot is. So that's like, you know, what the real, uh, like, you know, what the real, uh, meaning of, like, you know, right, monetization, right? Understanding of your user, and then, like, you know, the scale is yours, like, you know, the ground, like, in the field, is yours. So, we, we, we, we got to know where we are working, where we, we, where we need to work, and we are doing that right now. So, that's, that, that's a process right now.\n\nGot it. So, so the next stage is unlocking UA with capital, but also unlocking UA with higher LTVs, which again means that you have to not only become better at app monetization, so whatever mediation platforms you're using and so forth, but also adding live ops as a part of your, your tool set. So, currently, there, there hasn't been much focus on live ops, right, with the type of games you're making.\n\nYou've heard of Heroic Labs by now, and we keep talking about them because you need every edge to be successful in today's market. Heroic Labs Gamestack is built like a brick house. You got the Nakama, their backend game server, Hero, their game development framework, Sattorii, their live op service, and last but not least, Heroic Cloud to provide massive scalability. Heroic Labs is a battle-tested partner, and their tech enables you to be flexible, creative, and scale for success. Focus on your game, avoid tech risks, grow your product with scalable live ops, and save a big chunk of cheese, all with Heroic Labs.\n\n[Music]\n\nWe, we, we have been working on live ops. Um, um, but to be, to be honest, uh, Misha, like, you know, last year we acquired Gleam Games from Turkey. Mhm. So it's like, you know, one of the studios we really adore at Game District, and the, and the CEO of Gleam Games, now the chief strategy officer at Game District, and the reason why we, why we have this game on boarded with us is the reason we wanted to know that how good Turkish teams are doing the live ops and doing all the things. So again, like, you know, I don't want you to take hit and trial method and wanted to learn it in the next one or two years by over self over ideology, simple that, you know, if we are doing something good, let's build the best brains who just know they have been done, like, you know, a couple of times, and they don't know this part of the world, which we have been doing, and then, like, you know, the two brains comes in, and then, like, you know, the knowledge team would be like, you know, it's a two-way steam from Turkey and Pakistan, and something new will be happening. So, that's like, in the, the, the way we have been thinking, and we acquired Gleam Games, and I think it would be, um, it was instrumental for us, like, you know, when it's come to, like, you know, understanding the data, how, like, you know, the raw data can be really benefit for you, uh, the live ops of the games and everything. So, we have been working on this with, like, you know, uh, and, like, you know, he has been instrumental till now.\n\nThat's, that's really good. Okay. So, and, and how about the other competition that you're facing now in Pakistan? Like, I assume that you're competing for talent and for, uh, games with Voodoo and, and probably Omar and, and all these, like, um, European triple dot. So, basically, these European-based, uh, publishers, right?\n\nUm, I, I, I still think Pakistan has a huge margin to play with any of the European studio. This is my philosophy. I said, like, you know, uh, the thing is what we, what we do in terms of talent. Um, it's okay, like, you know, you can, you can, you can hire talent from Pakistan, but we are producing new talent. So, they would be always, like, you know, new talent, and the top talent, we always, like, you know, wanted to retain, um, retain, like, you know, at any cost. So, that's like, you know, one of the things, but the second thing is that, you know, the biggest problem what I've seen with the western studios is they're, like, you know, breaking one window, and they're, like, you know, for example, uh, any company makes need to make 20% more money, uh, to, to compete with the Pakistani ecosystem. So, for example, if a company is making $1 or 10 cents, like, you know, they would be not profitable. They need to, like, you know, make $1.50 to be competitive with a Pakistan ecosystem. And where we have the cost advantages, we have to only make $1 and maybe 15 cents, and we will be profitable. That's like, you know, the competitive advantage we have being in Pakistan. And then, then we wanted to leverage it with the right, like, you know, placement of the things, we can leverage it for the next, like, you know, couple of years. So, that's like, you know, over mindset that, you know, with this mindset, the leveraging mindset of, of the competitive cost, we can play a longer game with any of the ecosystems, and that's why, like, you know, we are not getting, like, you know, uh, we, we don't see anyone as our competitor, competitors, but we see that, you know, we can help them, uh, in a different ways to, like, you know, get their profitability or growth maximized. So, like, you know, if triple dots, Voodoo, or Hom wanted to grow, they wanted to think as Pakistan very differently or Vietnam very differently. So, that's my philosophy on that.\n\nAnd have any of these outside Pakistan companies set up operations in Pakistan, or are they treating the market more like an outsourc, outsourcing for higher market, or a place where you can buy an a game? I think, I think, I think Line Studio was the only who has, uh, who has, like, you know, something going on in Pakistan, then, then we say, like, you know, I think it's, it's all about, like, you know, the Adam's mind, who's, like, you know, much clever than the whole industry, that he able to understand it before anyone else can do that. So, I think that, like, you know, now the more studios will come here and able to understand that, you know, this Pakistani, uh, like, you know, competitive advantage.\n\nInteresting. Um, when, when we're thinking about, like, the bottlenecks for growth for Pakistan, correct me if I'm, I'm most likely wrong, but the way I'm trying to understand ecosystem is I put in, like, five meters or bottlenecks for growth. One is timing, which is, you know, something you can't really hit as market, technology, whatever it is. The, the second one is talent. So, how, you know, the seniority of talent, the, the pipeline of talent. The third one is funding. So, access to capital. The fourth one is infrastructure. This means, like, platforms, regulations, uh, payment systems, you name it. And the fi, final one is cultural challenges, which is expectations, appetite for risk, and so forth. So, when I, for example, go through Helsinki, I would say, hey, like, you know, timing wise, in terms of gaming, bit challenge with the type of games that we're making. No hybrid casual here. Know hyper casual only. Midcore, to be honest, at this point, which is like the most difficult, or even PC, that's a, that's a tough one, but talent, we got plenty of talent, funding, we got plenty of funding, infrastructure, we got plenty of infrastructure, cultural challenges are huge in Finland, and again, that I'm seeing, which is appetite for risk is low, appetite for success is, if it comes, it comes, if it doesn't, it doesn't, it's all fine, you know, rather than, like, the, the cutthroat appetite rights of, of the, uh, Tel Aviv or Istanbul, or probably Lahore. So, can you talk to these elements or other elements, like timing, talent, funding, infrastructure, culture? Um, what, what do you think is the bottleneck, and what do you think is a great driver for Pakistan?\n\nI think, I think timing wise, we, we are okay. I would not say, like, you know, in terms of, like, you know, timing wise, we are late to the party or something. We, we still have a lot of, like, you know, things to, like, you know, do in terms of timing, and we can, like, you know, improve it with over competitive ads on the cost. So, that would be the first thing when it's come to the timing. The second thing is talent. We have great, great, like, you know, young audience, like, you know, who's, like, you know, coming and who just, like, you know, living the life, going to the colleges and everything, and we are just, like, you know, trying to get them into a right place, which, which can be, like, you know, game industry or the IT services and everything, because, like, you know, Pakistan is an economic, uh, struggling country, economically struggling country, and the IT services is the most booming industry in Pakistan, so that's why, like, you know, all of the young guys and, like, you know, girls, like, you know, coming into the industry, and they wanted to learn, either they wanted to do the services business, or they wanted to be in the product side of the world. So, that is one thing. I think talent would not be really problem, but the biggest problem would be, it's like, you know, the top experienced talent. So, Pakistan don't, don't have, like, you know, experienced talent, and that's why I think one of the best thing would be that, you know, the consultants, uh, and the, like, you know, right people who just know the industry from, like, you know, 20 years, 15 years, or 10 years, they know that, you know, what is the right way for them, for, for example, like, you know, how Game District solve it out. So, Game District has a position, then they can, like, you know, get the right consultants, right people, or actually, um, u, like, you know, acquiring the studios, by acquiring the studio, it's not like, you know, we wanted to acquire the game games, we can make, we wanted to acquire the mindset to, like, you know, developing into a longer period of time, and where we wanted to be the next Talib, or, like, you know, the next, like, you know, Istanbul of the world, so that's the, that's the, that's the thing, then we, we, we have been, like, you know, uh, like, you know, we don't have really good BIS to understand the marketing and everything. We just, like, you know, catching up with everyone, seeing it from the world, and as I told, like, you know, whatever we like, and we thought, like, you know, it could be beneficial for Game Listic, we, we try to snatch it, if we, we, we, we have been very smart, like, you know, in terms of, like, you know, these areas, we, we have been, like, really good, and we anything, like, you know, from a founder or, or, or any, like, you know, guy, I like it, I wanted to be, like, you know, tell them that, you know, I wanted to snatch it from you, and then, like, know, we talk, and we have been, like, you know, so, so good in terms of, like, you know, people loves us, this gaming, whole gaming ecosystem is beautiful, to be honest, like, you know, people are, are happy to help you, people are listening to your story, and then they know that, you know, it's same kind of founders, which is, like, you know, a couple of years, like, you know, younger than they, they are, and they are happy to help all the time, and this is, this is one, one of the, one of the things when it's come to, like, you know, the way we are looking forward to the future, and the last thing you, you ask, I've just, like, you know,\n\nyeah, funding, infrastructure, culture, funding, the, the one of the, one of the infrastructure problems, I still think, like, you know, we, we have been, we have been working with government a lot, and government has been very, very understanding, and they have been, like, you know, doing it, like, you know, with, with all the challenge they have, they have been very supportive, they have been always very supportive. It's, um, they're just trying to do, uh, like, you know, uh, they're trying to help us in, in, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of, like, you know, the facilities and everything, they, they want to develop. There are, like, you know, a couple of infrastructure problem on the, uh, dollar account side, they, which, which government has been working with us. Uh, and the third thing is the UF financing. I think UF financing is something which, which could be instrumental, and the thing is, the lower the interest, the maximize the profit would be. So, that is one of the things, like, you know, how this industry can be actually revolutionized in Pakistan, because the people, I, I've, I've met, like, you know, a lot of guys, they have the games, uh, they have, like, you know, the things they have, they wanted to risk at all, but the only thing is, they don't know the way to, like, you know, take it forward, um, so they, there is no, like, you know, VCs, there's no banks, like, you know, support in the credit lines, there is no, um, only, like, you know, the credit line supports, or, or, or, or, or, or, like, you know, US sports, we are thinking from, from this, uh, like, you know, big companies, like, uh, like, which, which, which, which, which they think that, you know, are, are very, um, very crazy when it's come to the interest rates. So, that's why, like, you know, people don't want you to take that risk, because the interest rates are so high that they don't want it to go on that way, and that's, that's the only reason I would say that, you know, people are not taking the risk, otherwise, they are, they are right people, they're taking very, very high when it's come to the taking risk as, as high, probably I would say, uh, the, um, Israeli and Turkish ecosystem, or the Vietnam.\n\nYeah, can you talk a little bit how about Pakistanis as, um, as entrepreneurs and, and, you know, early stage, uh, employees, like, like, how do you work essentially in Pakistan, because I'm asking this because, like, uh, you know, on LinkedIn, we have this, these, not only LinkedIn, but that's, that's one of the media, we have this clash between, uh, VCs talking about hard work, like, 20-minute VC, Harry Stemings talking about, like, 996 in China, and, and basically raising awareness that if you want to be the 0.00001, 0001% of the companies, the 10 billion dollar companies, you got to work like a maniac. There's no days off. And he's saying in the US, seven days a week, it, you live your company. And then there's a huge backlash with, uh, with, you know, with the, the European way of working, like, people work life balance is like a holy thing here, and like, we have pretty much socialist states everywhere, and so that sets a totally different type of expectation, and that's a giant culture clash between the entrepreneurial class and the, uh, the, the work, the work, you know, uh, not the normal workforce. So, I'm, I'm, and then I go to Turkey, and everybody pretty much normally works between 10:00 AM to 11:00 PM. That's not a crazy day. That's not a crunch day. This is the just delay the, you know, the day in a Turkish startup is, is like that. And they are happy that they don't work seven days a week anymore. Now they've cut into six, or maybe sometimes they go lazy and only work five days a week. So, so just curious, how do, how Pakistanis work?\n\nAttention app and game developers.

company needs it, they will, they will work for seven days.\nIf the company needs six days, they will do six days.\nIf the company needs to work on eight days also, they can do the eight days thing also.\nBut the only, the only thing is, the only thing is that, you know, at Game District, what we have think, what we have been thinking that, you know, let's not, like, you know, uh, go the Western way, but the leverage should be on the employee side to have, like, you know, little family time, little good time, because, like, you know, that's the, that's the way they can, like, you know, produce really good, uh, like, you know, uh, things.\nAnd I would say, I would say this, 996 in China and everything, we, we have seen it.\nUh, we have a small team in China, they incredibly fast, but the only thing in Pakistan is that, you know, we are really early to understand all these cultures and everything.\nSo, for example, like, you know, all this Gen Z's and everything, they have been reading and, like, you know, talking about the cultures and everything, but in terms, the culture has very tightly, like, you know, knitted with the work quality and what where you want it to go.\nSo, for example, if you talk about the Finnish ecosystem with the Roios and the Supercells of the world, they probably can say that, you know, they have achieved something out of that industry because, like, you know, great companies, $10 billion plus, like, you know, uh, values, but you can't, like, you know, give the same culture to Pakistan, which has not been even arrived to the red carpet.\nSo for that, the grit has to be there, the, like, you know, the mindset has to be the startup mindset and the decisions, like, you know, how you wanted to take the energy and the nourishing, how, how, where your, where you take your country, uh, to the podium.\nSo that's, like, you know, one of the fundamentals I would say, like, you know, um, teams needs to understand, because the thing is, we, we have not arrived, we have just, like, you know, shown our cards to the, like, you know, god, and they just, like, you know, make us enter into the podium, but now from here to, like, you know, go forward, it's a, it's a long, long, like, you know, uh, way to, like, you know, look good and everything.\nSo I think all of that work we need to have to do.\nIt's not only about the employees, but I would say, like, you know, the founders and the co-founders and, like, you know, the top management into the gaming companies in Pakistan needs to work crazy, needs to understand, needs to, needs to talk to the more developers and more, more, uh, more founders around the world.\nThat's, like, you know, one of the things I would say, I, I wanted to encourage, uh, to, to my teams at Game District, anywhere that, you know, the more we need to, like, you know, understand, um, the ecosystem and how they actually working, and actually, we, your, your podcast is, like, you know, one of the, like, you know, spot-on things to understand the cultures and how, like, you know, these different ecosystems are working, so you can evaluate yourself that what you are asking for.\nSo that's, like, you know, one of the things, even, like, you know, not for Pakistan, but I think if your, like, you know, podcast go into the Finland and a founder sees that, you know, how the other, like, you know, ecosystems are working and they have been competing, they have to compete with them, so it would be, it would be a different mindset shift for them also.\nSo if you wanted to be, like, you know, compete with China, the nine and six, how, how you can, like, you know, compete with them, they are, like, you know, great talent in doing nine and six, it's, it's, it's going to be very, very massive and challenging for, for the, for the rest of the world.\nYeah, I mean, and you can see that, you can see the proof in the pudding because they are taking over the game industry as a whole, no matter whether you're talking about double AAA mobile, they're just, they're just everywhere.\nThey're just everywhere.\nThey're everywhere.\nAnd, and just, just beating the competition.\nAnd, and yes, I mean, I worked at Chinese companies.\nI know, I, I've seen people sleep at the workplace.\nIt's, uh, it's, it's pretty brutal the amount of hours they put in.\nIt's also, they, they don't talk about things like how, um, the workforce turnover, for example, is pretty big.\nWhen you run 996, you lose about 50% of your workforce in a year.\nYeah.\nAnd sure, it works when you have over a billion in population and you live in cities with tens of millions, but I don't think it's, it's possible.\nAnd it's, and this is just me saying, like, yeah, there's no one way.\nThere's a way for, for your ecosystem, but there's also a way, there's a way to succeed.\nThere's a way to find a way for your ecosystem.\nAnd there's also a way to fail.\nAnd that is by, by copying somebody else without understanding what their, what their, you know, unique elements are and why they are able to do it.\nSo, yeah, 100%.\nInteresting.\nUm, if you would compare Pakistan to other competitive geo, uh, geo area or countries, like, for example, uh, Turkey, you mentioned, let's say, Finland, India, Vietnam, which is another one that is rising, like, what's the country's superpower in, in this one?\nLike, what, you know, how does it stand out?\nSo one of the superpower we have, I think we have the highest growth rate in the world right now in terms of population.\nI'm, I'm just, like, you know, saying it from, like, you know, I'm just saying it, like, you know, from the Finnish perspective, where the growth rates are minus and Pakistan is, like, you know, surplus.\nYeah.\nWe have a great, great, like, you know, youth population, which is, like, you know, very, very hungry, very hungry.\nI think we have, like, you know, 60% of our population, which is, like, you know, in 20, 20 and 30 years of, like, you know, so that's, like, you know, one of the superpowers we have, if we, like, you know, give them the right direction and it can, like, you know, ignite everything.\nWe're very hungry guys who wanted to, like, you know, do it, like, you know, for, for themselves, they wanted to, like, you know, challenge the world that, you know, even the, even Pakistan can, like, you know, produce really, really great things.\nSo that's, like, you know, one of the, one of the superpowers we, the people, the people, we as, as all united together, we think that, you know, that's the biggest superpower we have.\nAnd the thing is, one, one another thing is the, uh, power of learn, so the smartness of doing things and the power of learning, so that is the second thing I would say.\nSo with this, like, you know, top talent of, like, you know, young population, and then, like, you know, they're, they are not, like, you know, the young population who don't want to do something, they are hungry, like, anything, and at the top, um, the, the way they learn things and the, and the way that they, the, the things that they do, do very smartly, is something very, very unique in the world.\nSo that's, like, you know, I would say how we can, like, you know, portray Pakistan, it's a young audience, smart learners, and great in doing things very smartly.\nHm.\nUm, and how about, how about the type of, uh, the type of games that you focus on in, in Pakistan versus the other ones?\nLike, we know Turkey is hybrid casual and puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, or, you know, um, and then if you look at Finland, this is more like midcore mobile type of an area.\nA little bit of a PCA.\nUm, Vietnam, hybrid casual, but still not too many publishers.\nThere's publishing for others and kind of incubating their own powerhouses for publishing.\nSo where does, uh, where does Pakistan stand in terms of genres?\nI think we, we have been, like, you know, really big success with the simulation category before and now also.\nSo Pakistan, whole Pakistani ecosystem, if you, if you see back, like, you know, in five, six years back, the biggest, like, you know, simulation success was coming from Pakistan.\nSo either, like, you know, car parking or, like, you know, driving simulators and everything, it's coming from Pakistan.\nAnd now, like, you know, the, like, you know, I would say, like, you know, very, very refined version of that kind of simulator is comes from also, like, you know, Game District.\nPakistan was super, uh, market simulator, which is, like, you know, a simulator of the supermarket.\nI think that's, like, you know, one of the very core genre of, like, you know, Pakistan ecosystem where we have been, like, you know, working very well.\nThen, like, you know, we have really good, like, you know, simulation, like, you know, hyper casual games coming from Pakistan also.\nAnd now the whole industry is actually, actually transforming, everyone is looking for their, like, you know, piece of pie.\nFor example, we are also, like, you know, trying to, like, you know, crack the puzzle genre with the right kind of mindset, because, like, you know, puzzle genre is not only developing games with the right numbers, but understanding the right monetization and how you taking your game into the longer cohorts of, like, you know, profitable.\nSo, for example, Turkey, in Turkey, there's a lot of VCs who, like, you know, spending millions of dollars, it's very easier to, like, you know, go into the longer cohorts and tell them, like, you know, we are getting successful in day 360 or probably, like, you know, much more than that, it's, it makes a lot of sense.\nBut in Pakistan, when you have, like, you know, bootstrap, like, you know, way of, uh, like, you know, uh, developing or building the products, you need to find out that, you know, in the hybrid casual genre, you need to also redefine the hybrid casual that, you know, these are the games who make their ROAS positive in 45 or 90 days.\nSo that's, that's the only way your, your cash mechanics actually works, otherwise, like, you know, you can't go for the longer cohorts until unless there would be, like, big VCs or, or, or other, like, you know, big, uh, big, uh, like, you know, UA financing companies come to Pakistan, then, then the Pakistan mindset would be changed.\nSo based on the mindset and based on the things we have, this is the mindset we have.\nIt's about, like, you know, all the hybrid games which make them self-profitable in day 45 or day 60.\nThat's the, that's the one way of looking what Pakistan is focusing right now.\nH, got it.\nUm, let, let's, I wanted to kind of pivot back to, you know, we, we kind of circle around and it's always gets back to capital as well as certain tech infrastructures that you have to build around live ops or whether it's UA financing.\nSo going back to the capital, talking about venture capital, uh, or global investors, talking about publishers, what should they know about the ecosystem?\nLike, if they, if they're not the Lion Studios of Applian or now Triple Dot, who are already active in the area, like, what's, what's sort of a misunderstood about Pakistan?\nI think there, there is no misunderstanding.\nIt's just, like, you know, they are missing out.\nIt's, it's just, like, you know, So one of my really, really good friends, uh, like, you know, it's Caesar from Tik Tok, which has been on your, like, you know, podcast, and because, like, you know, he saw the Turkish industry really closely, and then, like, you know, one of my friends who's, like, you know, also a Finnish, really, really a great guy, like, you know, who, who transformed, like, you know, Pakistani gaming industry from the Google's point of view, um, Kari.\nSo I always, like, you know, asked them couple of questions.\nI, I asked them, like, you know, from, I asked one question from Caesar, and I asked him, like, you know, you see the Pakistan, like, you know, large customer at Tik Tok, how far we are from Turkey?\nHe said, like, you know, you are three years behind Turkey.\nThat's how far.\nAnd then, like, you know, I asked Kari, I asked him the same question, Kari, you have all the datas and everything, how far we are from Vietnam?\nHe said, like, you know, Saad, one, maximum two years.\nSo the thing is, for the VCs and everyone who's listening to the, it's the time to invest in Pakistan.\nMaybe, like, you know, after three years, you come, the valuations and everything would be really different, but this is the time to understand that, you know, all these big guys from the gaming industry who actually see the gaming industry when it's come to the numbers and everything, and they say, like, you know, we are three years behind the Turkish ecosystem.\nSo it's something very, very well.\nIt's, it's something, uh, it's, it's a, it's a statement that, you know, Pakistani ecosystem done really well for themsel by all bootstrapping, by all, like, you know, doing by hustle and everything.\nSo it's time to, like, you know, take up on this ecosystem and take it to the world.\nSo let me ask you this.\nWhat would it take for Pakistan to hit that breakout phase that Turkey has experienced?\nI think the right way of, like, you know, using the right people into the system.\nUh, I think Turkey and, like, you know, all these companies has been very fortunate that they have very experienced people, and I think Pakistan is getting there.\nUh, like, you know, finding the right guys, uh, and, like, you know, getting their, uh, point of view into the games and understanding how product works, uh, what it takes to have a, like, you know, super hit product or a normal product, and what it takes to, like, you know, scale the product and what is the right, like, you know, layer of, like, you know, doing, uh, doing things better.\nSo, so, for example, like, you know, we have, we have been listening and we have been able to understand, okay, this is how games work, and when you grasp it more, you feel like you, you are, you are at still, like, you know, zero or, or, or one, there's, like, you know, a lot of things you need to learn and, like, you know, apply on your games, and then, like, you know, everything would be double it down from month to month.\nSo that's the whole new philosophy I would say, like, you know, we have in front of us, if we have the right infrastructure in terms of, like, you know, capital and the right people on place on the games, the games are already there, we just to, like, you know, put these people on the, on, on, on the podiums and tell them, like, you know, do their work, I think we will be growing double it down every month to month, so that would be, that would be, that would be my philosophy that, you know, if we have the right people and the capital, the growth would be unlimited in from Pakistan.\nI would say to unlock capital, you need exits.\nSo that, that's really what, what drove the other trading system as well.\nYou know, I was, I was talking with one of the guys in Griffin during the move also, and I told him, like, you know, why you're not coming to Pakistan?\nHe said, Saad, you know, how this, uh, Turkish ecosystem, like, you know, started everything.\nI said, tell me.\nSo he said, like, you know, after the peak acquisition, the peak founder give, like, you know, 50,000 check of, like, you know, 10 companies, and all the VCs, like, you know, give a lot of money to those, like, you know, companies who these, like, you know, guys actually give the checks.\nSo we're still, like, you know, looking for one big exit from Pakistan, hopefully really soon.\nSo I think it would be, it would be maybe, like, you know, biggest ignite, or maybe, like, you know, it would, it would make sure that, you know, Pakistan is on the, on the podium to, like,\n\n\nYou know, serve to the world of mobile games.\n\nYeah. Well, Saad, you've been at the forefront, you know, waving the Pakistan flag for game development. Maybe you'll have to also do the exit for the country.\n\nI need to think about that.\n\nMaybe we need to have a little more chat about that after the podcast.\n\nOkay. Nine, nine years in running. So, um, I mean, this is really, really great, and so happy we were able to do this first podcast because we're going to do more, but on site, hopefully next time, hopefully in Lahore. Uh, if not, then maybe in Abu Dhabi midway.\n\n100% 100% man. And, and kind of like my takeaway from this conversation is like Pakistan is really in the, uh, the earlier, the scrappy builder phase.\n\nYes.\n\nUm, you got hungry talent. Uh, you got a lot of focus, you got, you know, systemic challenges to overcome, but the techroot culture, it's, it's in the grassroot. It's really resilient, and it's still forging that identity that is that is now forming up, and as you said, between two to three years from hitting that Istanbul stride. So, you know, or as we said, one exit away from becoming the, uh, the focus of the Venture Capital.\n\n100%. We, we are, I'm really, really happy to have this conversation, and I think, uh, this conversation will ignite a lot of things for Pakistan. I know that you know, uh, your deep roots connections. So, I know that you know who are who are the people who are listening to your podcast podcast, and I'm really happy that you know, we had this conversation. It's a long due conversation for the Pakistan ecosystem, and I'm really thankful to you that you know who actually talked to me and, uh, bring us on the on your podcast, and I think I think it'd be it would be massive to like, you know, chat with you more again in Pakistan. I hope like, you know, Google do it before July, and you will be like, you know, you'll be here and talking with developers, and then like know you see it by yourself.\n\nWe'll do an event this year. Let's do an event in Pakistan. It's after this podcast. I think it's easy to get a nice group come together and and fly off to person, and we we can't like, you know, wait to like, you know, host you in our office and like in a lot of other places.\n\nPerfect. Well, it was always a pleasure to talk to you. Um, I know I'll see you later this year. So, uh, until we meet again, and for folks wanting to connect with Saad, there's a link in description below on his LinkedIn profile. Just DM the nicest person in Pakistan. I don't know too many Pakistani, but I can say you're the nicest person I've ever met in Pakistan.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you so much, Visha. It's been so nice and love talking to you, man. Love talking.\n\nAmazing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody for listening and catch you next time.\n\nYou did it. You made it to the end of the episode.
