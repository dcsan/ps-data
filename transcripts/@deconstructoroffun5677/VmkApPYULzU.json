  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSophie, you're a pro at podcasting.\nSo, you know, when you said you had a hard stop, I could talk non-stop, but then let's start recording.\nSo, let me do a nice intro.\nCan I do a nice intro for you?\nYes.\nAll right.\nSophie Vo, you've been a studio founder, a podcast host, a startup operator, and a co-worker of mine.\nAnd now you run Orin Retreats, which is not a typical business.\nYes.\nIt's not a business tied to gaming either and not even a scalable business, but by your own words, which you posted on LinkedIn, you said it's the most successful and aligned work you've ever done.\nSo I want to start here.\nWhat version of success were you chasing before?\nAnd what does success mean to you today?\nH, I miss you Mishka, asking the hard question from the beginning.\nI hope we'll get a little softer, but uh, I'm, I miss also the good, how you call it, like baring uh decision.\nYes.\nSo success before, um, was when I think of success, I was thinking of my parents actually.\nI think of my dad and what he call, he, I was reading when I was a teenager success story from in a magazine called Capital, capital in French, so basically big businesses.\nSo what does that look like?\nMaking billions, big, big numbers, uh, being at the top of a pyramid, right?\nSo the CEOs somewhere, because the CEOs are celebrated in those magazines and having an exist, because uh, even like, I would say the past five years, it was like the celebration where everyone is uploading each other and exiting the company.\nSo that's the ultimate goal, and then you reach super rich, and then all your problems are gone, right?\nYeah, 100%, 100%.\nSo that was very ingrained program definition of success, and I, I've tried the first stages of that road in different uh flavors, right?\nSo either being part of a company to just witness what the life of a CEO is in that kind of organization, when I was close to the CEOs, when I did the part more entrepreneurial part of a venture, and then when I was, it was last year, yeah, I was fundraising at GDC, if you remember, for a studio in Vietnam, three lifetimes ago.\nI remember the uh, the fit you all three of you wore, the uh, the very like classical Vietnamese slash like maybe Chinese vibe to me, but it was like Vietnamese vibes of a silk robe, right?\nYeah.\nYeah, we can talk about that if we, if, if we need to.\nI'm not going to put you on a spot on that one.\nI mean, I have nothing, I have nothing to hide, especially not in the conversation with you.\nBut I went through the journey of fundraising and asking myself more and more in the process, okay, my job as a co, and we spent some time together.\nSo I, I know all the ugly truth of the road, and I appreciated a lot how unfiltered you shared everything with me, and I asked myself, is this how I really want to spend my time and life?\nSo that was a real question when I was at GDC, super tired, going on a road show of investors meeting, sending emails, preparing emails and all the CRM and talking to see who've done the fundraising after they were preparing the next fundraising, so it never ends, you know.\nSo it's like 80% of your job uh, mostly, and the things that I love, which are building product, being creative, working closely with people, creative people, driven, creating something together in a very intense way, I would be steps away from this, and we had that conversation as well.\nSo it was an honest look into what I really like, and then the dream of what I thought I wanted, and that's there was a dissonance, and back to the question of what is success for me today.\nI spent time also with a coach to examine that, because at some point I felt really stuck, and it's like, what am I doing?\nI have three ventures at the same time, I have a podcast.\nI, I feel really overwhelmed, and I can't choose what is, where is the path I want to go to, and I just reexamine questions of my life, and back to what I said, for me, ownership of time.\nSo the moment I feel stressed is then I'm pulled to be somewhere, I'm pulled to go to a meeting, to an event, to do things that deplete me, those emails, those meetings, and so on.\nI, I really don't, I hate it.\nI'll say it frankly, I, I hate that part, and I understand it's necessary, but I asked myself, is it something that I need to do?\nOwnership of my time was important, and um, working where my zone, I consider my zone of genius, is where I energize myself and where I believe I have impact, and it's maybe not externally seen as impacting millions directly, but it's more impacting individual people who are multipliers, and so that's when I realized maybe I, I should spend more time there and explore and and forget about that question of success and and status and all that thing, those things, um, and independence, you know, financial independence\nwas important, because it's not maybe something talked so much in in your podcast, but I have to bring it up maybe as an entrepreneur, because that's what's in the mix.\nI was looking into my family plan and life, and I, I want to be a mother.\nSo I, I wanted to plan for this, and then I was just looking at the craziness I was doing on a road show at JDC and what's next, and I just didn't see this kind of life matching.\nSo I was, I need to prioritize.\nSo what kind of life do I want?\nBut I could be available as a mother raising a child, be doing what I love, still be an entrepreneur, but in my terms.\nSo I had to define basically my own structure, my own ways of working.\nThat's why even when you talk about Orin as unusual business, this is kind of a result of it for something that works for me.\nSo you kind of realized that the version of success you were chasing wasn't the actual what you wanted was when you got into basically the uh, the gaming startup and and fundraising part.\nYes.\nYes.\nI like for that that venture, Kilan.\nSo the role of a CEO, and I, I saw this is going to be a road of 10 years if I really want to make it work.\nIt's a commitment.\nIt's not I'm going to try and be like a toe in the venture.\nIt's I need to commit.\nI needed to also be in Vietnam.\nSo it was big decisions and also the co-founders alignment was not there.\nSo it was like, okay, that's, that's what, that's not worth, you know, the sacrifice.\nI tried also with an AI coaching startup.\nRight after it, I built Olivia, which was more aligned with what I wanted to explore out of gaming with someone I knew.\nI worked with Marco, my former colleague when I was building the studio at Voodoo.\nAnd it was going really well.\nWe had interest of investors because we were in a bootstrap road, AI.\nThe fear I had at that moment is I'm scared to get an investment because then I need to commit.\nAnd so when I realized I had that that moment, I was something is off.\nWhy am I afraid to receive investment?\nSo, so that, that, that was an interesting thing.\nSo do you think like venture-backed model is fundamentally broken for most founders or like what's the, what's the impetus there?\nLike why are you afraid of an investment?\nYeah.\nSo I, I have to comment also on the many private conversation I've had with founders from VC back companies, VC back companies, and what they shared in very confidential rooms that I would pro, probably not share to investors or other peers, because they're, you know, that it's not always safe to share, but I share, but\nit's safe, but not smart.\nYes.\nYeah.\nI mean, you, I, I, I don't know if you can share, of course not, maybe publicly, but what I got as pattern is a lot of founders came very naively on what was the journey they, it's like even a shock for me, it's although you can do a bit of research and understand what what you're getting yourself into, but it was for some reason the myth and belief, I can run the company the way I want, fully, like no, that's not, I know that's not true.\nI can get out when I want.\nNo, you can choose who you work with.\nNo, because when you are tied to co-founders, and usually I also hear the stories of co-founders where I hear the story from one co-founder side, like how, how do I get out of this?\nYou can't.\nSo there's, there's a, there's a mismatch in the expectation of founders who maybe there was less due diligence.\nI don't know, in the wave of 2020, capital was there, and it's like a career ladder.\nI think what I see is like people who are employees doing well in some places, and my next career later stage is to build a company, but they're not necessarily entrepreneur, and we talked about that a bit offline before the recording.\nSo they didn't really integrate, internalize what it means to really build a business, and especially on the VC route, where the ultimate goal is to multiply the return in a very uh, you know, big way.\nIt's not like 2, 3x, it's like 10x minimum and even beyond.\nSo you are going on that route, and the question is on which part of the journey will you be, and on which part of the journey will you not be, then don't think about that, how do you feel about scaling your company to thousand people if you need to, you know, suddenly, um, all those questions, and so when they start to go there, they hate their job.\nSo that's, that's where I see the mismatches.\nIt's like a bad dating, you know, a bad dating that happened.\nWeb.\nOf course, you've seen what good looks like, but have you seen great?\nAppch charge is the direct to consumer platform backed by the likes of

changing industry, we've stayed the course.\nBootstrap, profitable, and proudly independent, our founding engineers still lead the way, driving innovation and stability developers trust.\nJust like Unity and Unreal transform game engines, Heroic Labs is doing the same for back-end game tech.\nOur open-source platform, Lama, has nearly 10 million downloads and powers thousands of games worldwide.\nHeroic Labs proven for 10 years, built for the next 10 and beyond.\n\n[Music]\n\nI, I would say you've talked to a bunch of people who went, who got VC funding and who got into the VC game without understanding what venture capital even is.\nAnd it happened during the boom of gaming, especially 2020 to up to 2022, where everybody got funded, even I got funded.\nSo it was uh, it was very easy to get funding, and that meant that a lot of people got funding who should never have been funded in the first place.\nAnd what people don't understand about venture capital, it's called in Finnish, it's called risk capital, which is much better understood, and that means that you accept a incredibly high level of risk, and that's why you expect a very high level of return as well, and for a venture capital, the way they are responsible for their LPs, limited partners, which means their investors.\nSo people and entities and companies who put money into that fund are the clients of a venture capital, not the startups.\nThe startups are the input into that fund.\nAnd it's perfectly normal that majority of those startups will amount to nothing.\nAnd what venture capitalists are looking for is just like startups.\nThey're looking to raise more and more capital.\nAnd in order for them to raise capital, they need to show progress.\nAnd the way they show progress is they show markups.\nNot even always exits, exits would be nice, but usually you show markup.\nMeaning that a startup raises 1 million and then in the next round at 5 million valuation, and then the next round they raise 5 million at let's say 25 million valuation.\nAnd so the the size of the investment of that capital has increased by a lot in that case, like depends on what the post money valuation is, but we're talking about like, you know, 5 to 10 to 12x already without the exit.\nAnd those are the numbers as they amount throughout your portfolio is you're able to show the in the the LPS that hey, investments are going well, even though we haven't returned money yet, but we're now looking at being, you know, 4.2 over the the size of investment.\nSo it looks like they're going to be a positive thing, and that leads to the cycle, like once you start understanding is, of course, they need you to scale faster so that you can raise more capital.\nSo for them, you diluting yourself is the goal, like you taking more capital and growing even faster is the goal of a venture capital, and and many company, so many people who took money from VC don't understand that venture capital is not about creating good business, it's about creating hyperscaling business, that's it.\nPrivate equity, that is about, you know, creating a well, not not really, in theory, it's about creating a very profitable and good business, but venture capitalist don't, don't care if you're profitable.\nIf you're, you know, 10 people studio making, you know, two to three million Ebida every year, but running a small company, that that's a fail for them.\nSo, that's an important part.\nAnd then the second one you mentioned about the the co-founder misalignment.\nThis is the number one reason why startups fail.\nLike I, you know, I've been open about our journey as well.\nWe lost two co-founders from initial, like between four to five all the time just due to that misalignment.\nAnd I think it's based on, it's based on often times when people get together and they have a startup idea and it's so energizing, it's so exciting.\nYou're dreaming together and you're starting it for the loop.\nLike imagine we, we're going to exit at some, we're going to build this awesome thing, then we're going to sell it.\nWe're going to be rich.\nWe're going to be happy.\nWe're going to be independent.\nAll these things.\nBut the thing is that's the start.\nThat's the dating.\nThat's the dream.\nAnd if you get together with the goal of these things, independent, the loot, you know, the the yeah, those those two are the biggest thing.\nThen when the hard time hit and you haven't gone through the hard times with the people together, that group breaks.\nAnd that happens to most of these studios.\nAnd that's also part of my investment thesis.\nLike I always want to know how long have you been together?\nIf you just built this dream team to make this one thing happen, I'm out.\nI get it.\nYou're all superstars.\nIt's going to be a [ __ ] show.\nChances are you'll die in the middle of it.\nJust eat each other alive.\nYou could survive, but I'm just not interested in that.\nI've seen\n\n\nIt. I'm not going to, I'm going to do that. So, so, um, and then the final part is because people raising funds don't understand these simple principles of what is a good founding team, what is the goal of a venture capital, or, um, it's or, you know, the goal is not to build uh a good business, but a hyperscaling business. They miss the point of actually evaluating what kind of venture capitalists they take, and so they take whatever has a good name, let's say a big fund, uh, with a with a sexy accelerator program. There's a certain demand. The bigger the fund, the bigger the return they expect, and so the whole thing of like, I can exit at any point, yes, you can, if your fund is small, if it's, you know, a few tens of millions, it will be good for them, but if your if the fund that has invested to you is in hundreds of millions, you exiting so early is a waste of their time. Like, literally, the signing of all these papers and doing two board meetings meant they wasted time, and it will make them look bad for their investors. So no, rather you die than they get 2 million back, you know, and so it's it's it's really about not understanding the venture capital model. That's really why I've done so many episodes with different VCs, really allowing them to explain how their model works, and I still see the same thing where where founders like, oh, I just want to build this cool studio and cool little game. It's like, yeah, so you're not a VC business. It's not scalable. I talk to all the time, and I tell them that sounds like a good business. I'm not investing because that is not a scalable business.\nYeah.\nAnd there's nothing bad. Good and scalable, two different things.\nYes. So, I wanted to comment on that point, the scalable and the money part. There's a confusion, maybe I don't know, for some reason, if you don't build a scalable business, it's a failure. I think founders should really ask themselves, like, just own what they build, you know, so not all the businesses are meant to scale, and if they're not, this is definitely not a case for VC. And the attitude I see because I'm more on the side of bootstrapping, when you start, you don't even know what you're doing at the beginning, so why should that risk be taken by anyone external? So for me, it's more discipline. I feel responsible when I I start to receive money from others, and then you are forced to do something because you receive that money and you receive commitment, but when it's your own mess, then you know you can close it, do it again, and change. That's why I think in the mentality of, I see that's why founders who are employees turning to founders and haven't embraced yet the entrepreneurial mindset, that's the transition I see sometimes missing because it's like, well, I had a salary and I want to continue to have a salary, so I'm going to build a company with some money coming in, and instead of me as a founder holding the risk of what I'm building. So I believe in it. I put myself first in the line, and I until I really believe and I can stand by it, and then I will raise money. I'll do it. But what I see the attitude, so I'm happy we have this conversation to more create awareness. It's the automatic thinking. I'm starting a company. I'm going to raise money, and it's like, why? Who, you know, why can you, do you put your, did you put your own money? No. It's like, well, if you don't put your own money, why would somebody else put their money into your business? So it's just like the mindset of it, for me, it's is broken as well, how you start a company.\nYeah, I think you're absolutely right. Um, I, you know, in those type of cases where I discuss, I like when a company has bootstrapped because that means that they believe in what they're doing, and they have bootstrapped, not tried to raise, couldn't raise, and hence they were bootstrapping, that's a different thing, and they just call it a bootstrap, you know, like somebody's a consultant because they're unemployed, not because they want to be an independent consultant. Yeah. So, so when when you do the uh the bootstrapping, what I like about that is is that you're trying to find the product market fit before taking external money. So, you believe a lot in yourself, and you have the full ownership, and you're not selling a big portion of your company before it finds its value because you actually believe that this is going to be valuable. So, I'm not going to sell on discount. And also the the part about bootstrapping that is key is that it gives you speed because you're not getting money anywhere, and now you're doing this thing. There's no salary coming in. How long are you going to stay in this phase? 3 months? Four? Are you going to stay 5 months in this phase? How about six? And no, it's like these people are just hitting off, like, in a month they have a prototype ready and running. It's like, yeah, because it's your own money that you're spending by bootstrapping, and you want to get all the numbers in. Uh, you're going to do all the smart things as fast as possible. And the most important thing about bootstrapping rather than running to a VC right away is you, if you start off with with pre-seed funding from a VC. So pre-seed is meaning like the first check in, usually given as soon as you get the team together and and ready to sign papers. Now you're going to give a pretty sizable portion away from your company, could be 20% for 500k easily. That's a That's like a one of those like a dragon's den numbers where you're like, &quot;Oh my god, this is so bad.&quot;\nI saw 20% for 100k.\nYeah. Yeah.\nSo, so obnoxious amount of because the VCs are taking such a major risk.\nThe thing is is that once you now you get into the VC business, which as we discussed is all about markups. It's all about getting the next round of funding. In about two rounds after you get that big portion out, you are going to be unfundable pretty much if you haven't already found a product market fit because venture capitalists are going to own over 50% of your company. That's fine. Eventually, they will, if you're getting into that hundreds of millions of billions of scale. Yes, you will end up owning like 7% of your company, but that 7% is going to be worth 700 million. That's fine. But but if you are still looking to get that little extra investment for you to go to soft launch, and venture capitalists own 48% of your company, and with the next round they're going to be owning 62, they're just not going to pay for it. Like, like you become unfundable by taking money to earn money. So I've seen also those mistakes. I've I've tried to help startups who who reach out, and you know, we work with them, and and then when you see their cap table, it's like, guys, uh, game over, like the way your cap table, so meaning the ownerships, is looking at this point where you don't have a scalable product, means you cannot raise, and then there's going to be different things where we start clearing out the cap tables, removing the early angels and so forth, so forth, uh, that's a different type of a problem to fix, but yeah, taking bootstrapping is the smartest way to start.\nIt's a good test if it's for you.\nThat's what also I'm advising.\nTalk to me about your Olivia. Oliv, was it Olivia, the coach, the AI coach company. So you bootstrapped that. What happened? Because that sounded like when you were doing the Vietnam gaming startup, you know, I I of course had the the calls with your founders, and I told everybody in my own blunt way that I think you guys are crazy. You shouldn't be doing this, and you're taking advantage of Sophie. Like I was I was going all in. Uh, and they're like, &quot;This guy is an asshole.&quot; It's like, &quot;No, I'm just right.&quot;\nBut but with Olivia, I thought that that would go really well. Like it was not for the uh the Vietnamese gaming startup, but I was very much for, I thought that was a perfect fit. What happened with that?\nIt was a fit in terms of market. I was doing my research and applying all the product and uh we had an angle with Marco coming with our gaming background to apply really the the coaching interaction in a playful way. It was more a personal choice, right? So for me it was, am I the one to ride that that ride because when I wanted to bootstrap, I understood also very quickly, I can't afford to be slow in that market. I'm working with AI. So it's it's a race, you part of whether you want it or not. And that means you need to be fast in the market and and take the share of the market, the community build, and all of that. And so we needed a bit of capital to begin with. It's it's not like just the two of us doing in the garage development. We created the product, but community building. So when I had a possibility to have just a few hundred k already investment, I was, I don't know, there was something really weird that happened because I had investors coming to me, like, booking a lunch in Berlin, sitting like, keep us posted in the loop. He's like, wow, that's a very different dynamic from the Vietnam venture.\nYeah. Um, and so we sat down with my co-founder because also my co-founder was in a transition, and we we we asked ourself the hard question. Do we see ourself doing this for the next 10 years? Because if we start to take money, that's that's the commitment. I mean, I wish that it would be earlier. They okay, maybe we can have this out in five years, you know, who knows, but it could be 10 years. You never know.\nIt's two or 10, that's what it is.\nYes.\nAnywhere in between is really bad.\nYeah.\nAnd two, it's it's it's a hyper race, right? And then I saw, so his heart was not full into it. My heart was not full into it. And so, so we we we needed to have a hard look. And so sometimes that's the that's the re hard truth for co-founders. Your heart is not full into it, but you went for it anyway. And I can tell you it's still there a few years after it's, and then it's like, and when they want to exit, they can't because they don't have the options. So it was more a personal question for me. Do I want to get in the race? That means fundraising and all those crazy things and then spending my time, you know, when I thought already mobile games was on steroid because I remember as a product leader, tabs opens at the same times, watching the market inside, playing, I don't know, it was crazy when I stopped, I was on a hangover to realize, my god, that was insane as a rhythm, the amount of input, and AI is just hyper steroid. So I like, do I need this more in my life? Because you follow all the companies that are creating AI companion therapist, I see just one new every month, you know, so\nevery day.\nYeah, so yeah, if if you look deeper, yeah, so I was looking and is this the race I want to be in, and maybe there's something to say with age and phase of life, it's like, it's I I don't want this in my life right now. Maybe in my early 20s, I would have totally, like, I can move to the Bay and do and all those things. It's just like, I I don't want to do this. I really don't want to do this.\nYou would have been good in the Bay Area, and you'd be walking around and on stage doing keynotes. We wanted power. Yeah. It's kind of like doing all those\nI I did it in Berlin, and it had it had a good, so yes, I was I was on that path, but uh, it it's a very personal dialogue in the end, although we want to, you know, there are some many business you can create today in this world, and they are not not all the business have to be created by you, you just need to find the one that you know you're meant to create or you want to create.\nYeah, it's it it's interesting because like with an age of AI, I feel like distribution is much more important than even before because building is easier. So it's all about distribution and and um\nyeah, it's so\nand you kind of had it. So that that's what that's why I was like, do this, this is you, cuz you you have the distribution, so just you know, do it.\nI wanted to share my insights for everyone who think of doing games to app because it's it's not like a golden road, and then you know, it's easy. So distribution remains still a challenge, and I was going deeper into the B2C route or the B2B. So B2B, when you go B2B, it's a sales game. So then I knew, okay, that means I need to build a sales team and have people just bashing, bashing, creating relationship with whoever is the company client, finding your ICP, which is not my expertise. So I I knew, okay, I would need to develop the network there, and B2C is what I know from gaming, and then B2C, you have the same challenges with the CPI, the cost, the marketing, and in that case, for whoever is thinking going that way, I found a route that is a workar around to paid marketing, which is SEO, building on community engagement and where people can find you through the movement you create, and again, that was also another question for me, do I want to go in that race of content marketing? Because that's what it is about, where you create that platform, that blog, and all those channels and Instagram and LinkedIn, and I don't to to just create, start to create the mass. Um, so it's not a shortcut. It's not an easy road. Like you said, execution is I think pretty pretty straightforward.\nBut maybe this is a VC case, right? Where you deploy quickly to just create a lot of attention, attention, and something at last, why I chose not to go, it's an interesting one because it was not like I don't want to run that business, but it was more I get a lot of insights through the private conversation with Olivia, so I had 100 beta testers who were starting to use the product, engage on a regular basis, and what they were sharing there was really interesting, so it was not so much about help fix that problem, but it was a feeling of loneliness, uh, needing connection, what they wanted behind a coach was more to be seen, you know, to feel, have self-esteem, self-worth again, and I asked myself, do I believe AI should do that, can do that, and where is my, you know, personal physes, and that's when what led to create Orin actually, when I knew I don't want to actually contribute more to the AI to replace human connection, and I asked myself from a business point of view, what is it that I could create that actually bridge the gap of the lack of human connection. So I did an experiment, and I say, what does that look like for me to run a non-digital business, like go completely the opposite way, just for fun, you know, non-digital, non-scalable, to to go really\n\n\nIn the depth instead of the volume because AI, this is what is going to provide. You have your one-minute quick fix conversation anywhere, anytime, everything you can fix within a minute, but when it comes to depth and high quality, this is where the gap will be more creative. So I started to identify a gap where nobody was doing so much in that space, and I thought I will use technology to facilitate human connection, and where do I fit technology in that instead of being at the center to replace them. And so this part of being not scalable by design, that was important for you because of your learnings from Olivia, just seeing how lonely people are, how much they value that human connection, and instead of kind of following the truth, which is everything has to be hyperscale, which is the truth of a VC, you start following the truth of what would make a good business, and good business, and good business in a means like it's a valuable business, but it's also a business that you find longevity into the type of business that you can be working with for decades from now on, and that was where you began the idea for Orin, right?\n\nYes, so I saw, I looked at it really from a business point of view. There's a gap in the market for what people need because right now you can get quantity, but when you get quality, how do I make friends? A simple, dumb question. You can't go out there and, I don't know, get a technology app to find to make a friend, and I have worked enough with people in real life, real interaction to know at least from a system point of view how friendships are created by being together, by bonding together, going through hard times together, being real together, and it's human to human, you know. So, question, for example, you can talk to an AI and solve your problems, but it's not the same value, and I get those insights from Olivia when a human reciprocates to you and say, \"I see you, I understand you,\" and the AI tells you, \"I understand you,\" you know, that is, uh, you know, a machine. And even when we had in Olivia coaching appointments, that was actually quite an interesting anecdote.\n\nShowing up to the coaching appointment set by Olivia in the calendar because they know it's an AI, exactly.\n\nYeah, it's like, and then, and they will share them, but if it was a human coach, I would show up because I feel bad. I feel guilty. I let somebody stand there, and I realized we, I think we, it's very powerful, the human-human motivation because we know it's real. Did I give you this feedback because I think I remember giving this feedback to somebody who was in a, like, I think it was a, it was in the training space, like fitness space, and people were talking about these fitness AIs. I'm like, I have like me, you, nobody has any respect for an AI fitness trainer. Like, anybody can do a program. It could be better, a program that your, you know, regular juice head or juice head did this. I don't know what's the female version of a yoga head or whatever, but, but the thing is, like, I have a respect towards that trainer. I follow their social media. I know them as a person or know their personality, and through that, I respect them, and I follow what they've done, and they ask me to send, you know, progress through numbers, through photos, and so forth. So, so there's that, uh, uh, that accountability that is not with AI. And that's why I don't believe in any of these AI tools having longevity because again, no accountability to a computer. You could just, as you said, just not come to a meeting, not do those things, versus it's Sophie, and Sophie has set up a call at 10:00 a.m. this morning. You set that call up, and what? You're going to just bail, not do it? Like, you better have a good reason.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And there will be human consequences, right? So you have to deal with that. So I think that was a moment of insight that I was like exactly asking myself that question. If that's really the mission I'm on to, is that through AI? And I, AI, I use AI to amplify my work, but not this way. So I believe there's a gap still in human, and there's some physicisting physics in the space of AI, and where is the, you know, work value going? I believe there will be more creation around communities, network because that's the gap that people will feel like they can answer all their problems with a computer and software, most of them these days, if you have internet, you know, not even money, because if you have internet and mobile phone, but then making friends, this is going to be a tough one.\n\nIs brought to you by AppsFlyer.

Take away the phones.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's it. Put them together and take away the tool, and suddenly they are playing together. Done.\n\nI remember at some point you mentioned in your post that you were feeling depleted and uninspired. Was that between Orin Retreats and Olivia or?\n\nYeah. So not when I was by myself, but I had some moments of when I decided to build Rise and play. So it was five years ago. You know, you also started way, way back ago, the constructor of fun, where I felt my energy was not used properly in an organization, right? So you put a lot of, you think that this is your own bucket, the only bucket, and you put all the energy, and sometimes the company didn't have the environment, the space, or even the will to create the outlet I needed. So that's what I meant by uninspired, and so I remember I was at Voodoo at that time. I wanted to have a voice on leadership, and there was a lot of negotiation, what you can say, what you can't say, you know, those things, and I said, you know what, I'm going to create my own platform where I have my voice. So that was the moment where I I found a way to re-energize myself. But I had some moments in organization being limited and and being, you know, shrinking. That's what I meant by depleted. And I know this is the story also of the women I company who are in corporate, and and they just at the end of sometimes their life because it's like nothing is inspiring. They're also, you know, that reality. We work for women in teams where most of the time it's just us, and not to say that we don't, it's not about, okay, men's are problems and so on. I want to be very clear about that. But you know, sometimes when you with your buddies, it's like, you know, fish in the pond is energizing. We don't have that kind of energy refill sometimes being not with other women, for example, other people like us, and so being like the few ones in an organization doing the work that maybe is not the work you want to do creatively is the part that is depleting.\n\nHm. I have two daughters, and especially my my eldest one, she's now in school, been a couple of years, and she's with among other girls, and she hangs out mostly with boys nowadays because girls are nasty. Like the way you do psychological warfare is much worse than the boys. Boys would just fight and it'll be over, but girls to each other, and that seems to start early. Is is that only me? Personal view, and I talked to my wife, she's like, that was exactly me as well. I I had mainly boyfriends, like boys as friends, just because it was hard to get along with women. Is is this anecdotal?\n\nNo, it's not anecdotal. And I I'm glad you bring it up because there's much more complexity behind this. It starts early in school to even for women to start to be distrusting of other women from excluding, excluding women from, like, from that high school. Yeah. School experience. They are eight and they're doing this.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Uh, but also I I read a lot about that and talk also to other leader psychologists in the space to understand even in the work I do with women in leadership. There's a lot of insecurity, right, when we are young, and it it just translates in different ways. So of course, in a group of women, when it's women, it's girls here in the case of the school, it can be very nasty, like you said, because there's there's a lot of insecurity when you are young girl, uh, maybe with boys, I was also hanging out more with boys when I was younger, uh, because it was just you, what you see is what you get, right? There, there's not much going on, there's no depth, there's no depth, so you know, it was it was safe in that. Okay. Uh, so I understand it, and and then what it creates in adult, this is more where the problem is. Then you have women not helping so much each other, being kind of distrusting because there's still that school trauma, and we believe that this is how we still operate today. And of course, all of us go on the journey, we become more mature. For me, it has never been about gender, but it's more about self-aware, you know, a bit more conscious. So when women are together in a space and they are self-aware, it's a very different experience than just women together just because they are women. And that's not what I promote and actually want to encourage because it's not enough just being together and claim that we are women. For me, it's more how do we help each other when we create a power network? We talked about that. But we as humans, we just start to gather around us people who are like us. This is just very human. But for women, sometimes we are looking to get that help with in men's spaces, and we find it very difficult to get that seat at the table because it's not always possible in the sense that we are not the first one who comes to mind when you know you create an event, you think about your friends, and you think about the buddies in your life. So for women, sometime the conversation I have when it's about being part of a network, we are enough also when we come together and we can help each other create network opportunities, advising each other on the thing we both experience as well in the same way. So that's more my position around, you know, the women, and we can talk a lot about childhood and all, but it's very sociotone how you know that plays out, and it's goes really deep into how cultural, you know, how we raised, how our mothers are raised, how the parents are raising daughters, boys, so I'm not going to spend too much time there, but what I want to say, it's we playing high school just kind of dynamic when we in a business environment and as adults, and that's what needs to be updated.\n\nJust looking at my do my daughter, and I've been like, it's gone to a point where I had to go to school and and talk to, you know, like, the the adults, and like, dealing, it's it's pretty bad, like, and already at that level, like, yeah, I'm not saying that there's not like boys are somehow better, no, boys fight, and that's a physical violence, but now I've seen what this sort of uh psychological violence is equally bad, it's, it's like a long torment that they can outlast for like years that they can just do this. It's rather than punch you once in the face. So, it's like, what do you want to take? None of them are are good. But yeah, so, so it's good to hear because you're clearly trying to avoid that sort of a female click, but I, it's totally understandable that that you're bringing women together because like, it's you are a woman, so it's a, it's um, it makes sense.\n\nYeah. It's a network, you know, it's just a network where we share more intimate spaces, and we had that conversation in the past, and you know, you have also your own clubs and circles, and they just happen very organically. Um, and where the disappointment is, at least I can say for women growing in power, is when they want to belong to those clubs, but you, you know that deep down you never fully belong because it's it's not how it started. So you always are welcome, but it's different to be at the center of a group and be a guest, you know. So that's what I realized when I created those groups of women coming together. They are leaders. They are high achievers. They have a lot in common. Everyone is is on at the center of a group, equal, and not like here as a guest, you know, on on the table. And I know it's hard for you maybe to understand that in those words, but maybe I invite you in some spaces with women, and you know how it feels like, some events we had in Barcelona when men showed up. Although the topic was women in gaming, we never said it's just for women only. But the men who came, they they felt a little funny because they're, you know, they have to squeeze in some groups where women are chatting and so on, and it's uncomfortable, and some came and say, \"I understand how you feel now.\"\n\nYeah, I I guess that, yeah, makes sense. I'm always like, like, I'm happy to join. I wouldn't be uncomfortable at all. I'm like, \"Well, this is great.\" But uh, but I'm always like, weary about like, men who try to get to women in gaming events. I'm like, \"What are you doing?\" Like, it's their event. Like, why are you like, it's fine if you're invited, but like, why are you pushing yourself to to a group that clearly is not, you know, designed for you? It's like, I'm I'm like, I get, I get spider sense, like, what's going on with that guy?\n\nIt's an interesting one because there are different views about it where I think it's a welcome space where men could come to learn more. You know, it's it's it's open in that sense. But yeah, it could have different intention as well where you're just here to hang out for the wrong reasons. Yeah, there there are many where the mainly one I'm thinking about.\n\n\nLike, why would you try to virtue signal by going to Women and Games group? Like, this is clearly not like it's for them; it's for women. It literally says in the title, \"This is their get-together.\" Like, find your own, dude. Like, stop and then posting it on LinkedIn or other, like, using it as a, not like going there and learning and... But if you come out and saying, like, \"Oh, I was there and like, I'm such a good person,\" it's like, \"No, you're not. You just made it all about yourself and not, not about, like, you went there and learned something and... and just shut up and just keep it to yourself. Don't, don't use it.\" That's it's, you know, it's like donating and talking about how much you donated and where do you know donated. That's it's... it's not, it's not a charity even when we come together as women. I know, but it's like, it's like making something about you that is not about you, and that always is like the wary thing. And then there's other reasons why men would go to all-women events that we should not touch about here. So that's why I'm, I'm, I'm not inviting to you, or I don't want to come off as as wrong. I can come in, do my stand-up and and leave. And I can see that, you know, as a father of two daughters, uh, it is a way of thinking about it to be protective of that. Yeah. Yeah. Be cautious about men. That's my point. Keep them away from your events.\n\n[Music]\n\nSo, so, I mean, you work with fast-paced game teams. You run now these intimate retreats. What has the running of these, and I've seen them on Instagram, like, what has running of those in retreats taught to you about human motivation and what you wish that the game teams would understand from from those learnings?\n\nSo, in my coaching, especially, uh, business leadership, people come with a surface problem, business problem. \"My team is not working. My product is not working. The market sucks,\" you know, all the external reasons. At the very root, always is you. And nobody likes to hear that, but it's you. You hired that team, you chose that market direction, you chose to get that money, you know. So that's what we work on at at retreat is just to go get to the bottom of it straight because I, the retreat for me and Orin Retreats came together more as I got deeper in the work because I, I was repeating myself. It's like, \"Okay, here we are. We go to maybe a question of self-love, confidence, self-knowledge.\" And so the retreats, and it's not just the retreats that I organize, it's what I call the mastermind, so it's a group power group that comes together for six months, and they talk to each other almost every week. I have, we have a WhatsApp, and I can tell you there's a lot going on on many things, business, life, money, or whatever is helping each other this morning. Trump and Musk, uh, uh, kind of a drama. Love it. I love it. It's a... It's a... It's like an ongoing show. Sometimes it feels like it's not real. Yeah. Yeah. It's like you're living in a in a Netflix show. It's like if somebody would write this, it would... No. Like, this is not this is [ __ ]. Like, who would believe this? Yeah. So we, we cover anywhere all the topics on on business and life for six months. And the retreat is where we go really deep to take a step back, which is you wrote also about, or I think I saw it on your Instagram as a joke, but where back founders go on retreats, coaching, therapy, and all those things. Then you have a bootstrap founders, like, just hustling and with whatever. But especially when you have a bigger business, you always the heads down on in the trenches, and sometimes you completely miss the point of what's happening about you, about your leadership team, and where the market. So that allow supposed to take a step back, and that's what we also cover together. But usually it's not the tactical thing. It's more, \"How am I these days?\" And some people are burnt out, and they, they don't even realize they are and completely um, sucked by the company, and they are not even, they're more like a ghost running or being in the company than leading. So that's the work we do. We go deep, and especially with women, there are so many layers of it, which is how you lead, you know, so finding your way of leading, because maybe this is not something, of course, not something you might know, but it's like, \"Do I have to shout to lead? Do I have to assert and, you know, put my fist on the table?\" And it's like, \"How can I...\" It's a real question, you know, to exist as one in environment that is very masculine by by nature. Is it... when I say mascul... the more men in leadership. So that's a fact. And then business is has been run for a very long time with more men. So it has a certain way of leading and archetype and representation, you know, because those are those are like from movies. Like, if you'd go to, let's say, the most masculine organization, which would be the military. Yes. If a military officer asserts their dominance or power, they talk slowly, or they don't talk at all. And on the contrary, they lower their tone of voice, and and they create this silence around them where people like, \"Oh [ __ ], things are serious because people are not talking.\" And so this sort of approach of like a fist on a table and scream, like, like you're watching some sergeant going nuts. Like, that's not true dominance. Like these, you know, these majors and major lieutenants and generals, they're, they're serious people that that actually command the silence in the room. I'm happy you bring it up because in the end, it's about leadership, right? Mhm. But that the leadership you describe, I've seen it rarely, honestly, in business. So it's very unconscious. It's, it's very ego unchecked, toxic. I'm not talking about gender here, but that's the questions that come up in all my coaching, whether it's through the retreats, you know, how you get to that place where you can be confident in silence because you know you know... Yeah. Others... I like, I like that example, but it's not the leadership I see. I have to tell you, in most companies... Well, I get it. Like, I had the same problems and and have now in my own coaching, or I don't do coaching, I do advisory, let's be clear, I'm not a coach. I work with CEOs. Be a coach. No, I don't want to be a coach, but in my advisories and and I often am in the events with them, and what I always tell is like, \"Speak last, let everybody else let's go along, and then at some point, people will kind of turn to you.\" That's when they know who's the leader. Like, who's the last one? If you assert and jump in into every conversation, then you're part of this group that is shouting. Just take your time, listen, take notes, and speak last, and that will create that sort of a dynamic in the room that that it's encouraged to argue, which is good, and you should encourage them, but in the end, you are the one who's making decision. Good wisdom. And I also have a wiser... I also had a quote for you because you were saying like about ownership and something. I had a quote here from the Roosevelt, which who was president of the US, I don't remember which one, but in the in the early 1900s, he said that if you could kick the person in the pants responsible for most of your trouble, you wouldn't sit for a month. So, that's uh, that's that's part of the uh, the ownership stuff being mentioned. Um, I got a couple of questions. I know we're running out of time. I have so many that I wrote for you. This one, this is what you mentioned in your LinkedIn post. So, how did investing in coaching help you shift your mindset? Because you mentioned that you were stuck before in something, and then that that working with a coach unlocked. Can you talk more about that? Yeah. Um, it's a funny one because as I was coaching, um, so I know very well also how people receiving. I thought, you know, coaching is for the weak ones, you know, until now. But I mean, but you, we all have um, you know, that that somewhere, like, \"I don't need help. I'm okay.\" So I was in that space where I'm doing coaching, and I like, \"What, what is my support network right now? I don't have any.\" So I need to invest. It's like, so it was a very humble moment where, \"What am I doing? I, I need help.\" So that was first the point. I want to really set my life in the next 10 years in the right way, and instead of like spinning a company every six months. And when I found a coach in Berlin, it's funny, I, I hired him, this is actually quite funny, to uh, craft my marketing message for Olivia, and that's how I started, like, \"Help me with my marketing.\" And as a good coach, he started to ask me the hard question, and like, \"Why do you want to do this? What is Olivia? Okay, let's take a step back. What is it really that you want to do?\" So I, I started to share, \"I don't know if I want to do this company. I'm afraid to get in this month.\" \"Okay, that's interesting. Let's examine that.\" And yes, asked me a very powerful question. We went for a walk. So that's also inspired a lot my coaching. Not like being on a call and very brainy, but being a bit more free, do the walking talk in nature. And he said, \"Okay, you're trying to raise.\" I wanted to build Olivia to exit the company so I would have millions so I could build the business I wanted loot. And I was, he was looking at me. He's like, \"Okay, interesting.\" And then I was talking about that. I was like, \"This is absurd. The odds of it happening are very low and making my life very hard.\" And he's like, \"What is that business that you want to create once you exit?\" \"What do you see?\" Like, I imagine doing retreats. I think I love, I like to work very much with women in leadership on the podcast Rise and Play. This is already where I've spent time. This is where I'm energized. And I started to describe, \"Tell me more.\" I described, describe the whole business plan basically. And it's like, \"Okay, and what stop you from starting now this?\" And I did not have any answer except the fact that uh, I think I'm just scared to do what I really want to do. So I, it was, it was so weird to put yourself over blockers to not do the thing you actually want to do, making my life difficult, and I realized I'm just finding excuses to not do what I really want to do, maybe a non-scalable business, starting from this point. And I, I'll share at last, I think that can scale actually the business that I'm building, doing something where I'm really with the people instead of going all digital. So it required a lot of deprogramming and reprogramming, but that was the powerful question on going deeper. Why do I want to exit a company? And I lost my... I thought I, I was about to share something with you. Yeah. What did I say? Uh, something about... So you, you mentioned that hiring the coach, and he helped you to understand that what you want to do, you can do it right now. You don't have to go through the hell to get there, possibly, but you should start doing it from that point on. And yeah. Yeah. I lost, I lost one anecdote that I wanted to share related to that. But yeah, that's when when I started with um... smart... with the coaching. So, basically, coach helped you see what's already in front of you. But it's, it's normal, just like a therapist helps you to understand what is already there, and it seems obvious just because it's because it is obvious, but you're unable to see it, and then that's why you need external point of view. I wanted to ask you two, two other questions before I run out of time. One, like, there essentially they're the same. What is the worst advice you've been given and what's the best advice? Either or. Just start from from either during this time, uh, this, this time of of searching, you know, of searching what you want to do and what you need to be doing, like what, 'cause you know, you've been going through multiple startups and and trying to find out, trying to please the values that were said to you by the society, your parents, and what you thought was the right until you found that you're doing something that you believe in and that becomes the successful part. So in between this searching phase, which was intensive, what year, year and a half, best and worst advices? So the worst, I'll start with the worst. I like to start with negative. So people who work with me know that that's how I'm wired. You like to end with a positive. Yes. That's also another way of looking at it. It was actually from other women building companies. So interestingly, so I, I spent quite a lot of time in the women, female founders, female VC. And that's what I meant by unconscious. They were just on the train of, \"Let's let's create our own ego and status. Let's be female founders, exit, and so on.\" And so they were giving advice to push me, \"You can build this, and you can scale this and be...\" And it was just replaying kind of the same playbook and unconscious patterns you see, you know, whatever gender. So I felt that was just not sitting right with me, although the confusion is here. You listen to another woman, she's probably having good advice for you, you know, because we relate to each other as women in power. But that was not very helpful for me. And I understood, okay, I need to find my own voice. On best advice, I don't have a particular... it was from different conversation with entrepreneurs. I mean, some also that I had with you. I have to say, I was just following their path and just like, \"Don't care,\" you know. So what was very inspiring for me is like, from the moment you accept yourself and you're okay with yourself and you know you everything is okay, you know, so that that was very inspiring to just care less about what others think and just, yes, I mean, that's the journey and do the thing that you want to do, you're you're good to do, because it's not just what you want, but you're really good at doing, owning it, and having a voice out there, and that's the path I've been happier on, and I've been more vocal about taking position on certain things. So I think that's the best advice, to just challenge the way businesses are built and not be stuck in just one version of it, meeting interesting different people building different things. H, that's good. Well, thank you, Sophie Vo. Yeah, I wanted to share ahead about the last... Yeah, I, I speak in French now about the... Don't, don't... I'm really bad in French. The, the scalable part. I didn't want to build a...\n\n\nScalable business.\nSo as I build retreats, I saw I'm limited by myself because as I build retreat, I build those cords.\nIt's just limited by me.\nBut what started to emerge is the Women graduating through the program or in started to build businesses together.\nAnd there are businesses that create networks of Women.\nAnd so what the conversation we started to have is how can they bring Orin Retreats as a brand, a philosophy, to their own geography in Asia, in the US, and creating their version of retreats power network with their own flavor.\nSo I don't know if it's exactly the model of franchise and ambassador, but I'm creating a movement that is scaling through the graduates.\nThat's awesome.\nAnd that happened earlier than I thought.\nSo I see a path forward where I could scale this, but one step at a time, where right now I'm perfecting the core product.\nSounds like you're building a religion.\nThose are what do you call them?\nApostles or like what's the what's a you sit at a big dinner table with with 12 pupils.\nJust be aware that nobody betrays you.\nA religion has uh one one uh big uh I call it guru.\nI'm here to decentralize.\nMaybe it's closer to Buddhism in that sense.\nThis is more philosophy.\nJesus had also other people decentralize his his words.\nYeah.\nWell, anyways, your retreats look fun.\nDefinitely not my cup of tea.\nI like the ones with gyms and high-intensity workouts.\nYou're more of a breathing and and inner work, which I could use, but uh but I'm too toxic masculine to to do it.\nI mean, Sophie, I love how you reframed success through your journey.\nUh, just in a in a year, year and a half of intensive try and fail, you found what success means to you.\nAnd it's not a vanity metric.\nIt's not a pitch deck.\nIt's not a headline.\nUh, it's something that is very personal for you.\nIt's something very sustainable and something very deeply human as as you put in in in your post.\nSo, appreciate you always coming on the pod.\nYou're still uh actually on the the most listened deconstructive fun podcast ever.\nReally?\nYes, you are.\nWow.\nI'll take I'll take that metric.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, that's a one vanity metric you could you can walk with.\nBut thanks for for coming on and um really love to follow your journey as always.\nYeah.\nMishka, I I I was looking forward to our conversation today because I, you know, I appreciated a lot of our sparring talks and I appreciate also, you know, the space you create.\nI I also function this way where again like you get what you see and I like to work this way.\nWe talk about deep straight to the topics.\nYeah.\nI just wanted to say again thank you and I hope we do this again and swap the seats in some way.\nMaybe you come on the podcast this time because I want to ask about your journey.\nThis is usually how we've done things.\nI come and you come.\nI don't have a journey.\nI just do things.\nYeah.\nAnd I by the way I try so many things and fail on so many things all the time.\nSo it's it's also not linear.\nYou know we just launched a product yesterday and uh let's see how that goes.\nAn AI tool.\nSo wow.\nLet's see how it goes.\nAnyways, I may ask more about that in the future than if it works it works.\nIf it doesn't, there's going to be five new products we're going to launch.\nExactly.\nSo, without further ado, follow Rise and Play, follow Sophie Vo.\nIf you're a Woman, go on Orin Retreats.\nIf you're a man, don't go to Women and Games events unless you're invited.\nSo, Sophie, thank you for for coming on the podcast.\nYeah.\nThank you, Mishka.\nByebye, everybody.\nHave a great day.\nYou did it.\nYou made it to the end of the episode.\nAs a fan of the show, it would help us out if you'd subscribe and leave us a review on the podcast service of your choice.\nThose stars and likes, while a small action on your part, mean a lot to us and help to grow the show.\nMore importantly, are you a member of the Deconstructor of Fund Slack group?\nIf you have 5 years or more of games industry experience, go to deconstructorofund.com/slack and apply to join.\nJoin the games industry best professional community filled with peers always willing to lend a hand or subscribe to our newsletter to get all the latest insights from the deconstructor of fun content creators.\nThanks for listening.\n[Music]\n",
