  "cleanText": "But um, it's an interesting point of Pakistan because, like, not too many know about Pakistan's ecosystem, but those who know, know it's on the top. So, can you, or not top, but it's up and coming, like Pakistan and Vietnam are like the one ecosystems that people are talking about, are rising. People have played games that come out of Pakistan a lot, not knowing, like Hexosord, for example, uh, my favorite uh puzzle game for the last, what, two and a half years. So, can you talk about, like, what's driving the rise of gaming studios in Pakistan right now?\n\nI think, I think there, there's always two sides of an ecosystem to grow. One, it's the divine, and once the cerebral success this ecosystem creates. So, when it's um, come to the, like, you know, divine success, Pakistan got it before anyone else in the in in in the industry when it's come to the mobile games. So, back in 2010, a Pakistani studio made a game called Tapfish. It was huge. It was the, you know, area of, like, you know, the era of, like, you know, um, Angry Birds. But the thing is, like, you know, hang, like, you know, Finnish ecosystem use, like, you know, Angry Birds and develop the whole industry is phenomenal. In the other side, the Pakistani uh, like, you know, uh, unfortunate thing for Pakistan, this divine success were never able to create a whole big industry. So, the thing is, this game sells by Dena. Uh, so the studio is acquired by Dena, and then, like, you know, the founders actually, like, you know, flew, like, you know, flew out of Pakistan, and then, like, you know, the industry is, like, you know, all barren and, like, you know, at the back foot. So, if, if you see, like, you know, after the Flappy Birds or row, or, or, like, you know, all the industry, like, you know, grew up. So, that's, like, you know, the first thing about the Pakistan, but at the same time, what happened was, like, you know, it was some, it was the first ignition of, like, you know, taking things forward in the mobile industry, and the small studios uh stood up, and they were start working um at a, at a really big IT workforce in Pakistan. Pakistan mostly, like, you know, Pakistani studio started as a games as a service-based model. So, they just started, like, you know, working for the other companies of the world. So, that's, that's about the Pakistani gaming ecosystem. And then, like, you know, we have um companies like Mindstrom who deliver uh, like, you know, uh, this uh, ha puzzle for, like, you know, um, for, for uh, for, like, Pakistan has been the stigma that, you know, we are a small country, but in in in real, we are a really big country. Uh, and the thing is, like, you know, every, every founder or, like, you know, friends, like, you know, coming from, from anywhere in the world, once they come to Pakistan, they have been very, they, they have been, like, you know, become ambassador of, like, you know, Pakistan, I would say that, because the thing is, we are different, but we are very unique in our own way. So, that's, that's one of the things, but other than that, you're very right that, you know, uh, the great, like, you know, um, uh, universities we have, we, we still, like, you know, think that, you know, there's a lot more things can be done in Pakistan, but uh, we still have, like, you know, really good universities, and we have been producing really good IT talent and one of the best IT talent with very good English-speaking skills and everything, it's, it's very unique in the world. And then, like, you know, all of these Gen Z's, like, you know, in the world right now, for them, like, you know, working in a, like, you know, SAS-based product or, like, you know, enterprise software, it's not fun, where the gaming gaming company and developing games and, like, you know, running the character you have just developed or something, it's more fun. So, I think it's a, it's a great advantage for any anyone in Pakistan, and uh, the the only difference what, what we feel is right now is the difference between the uh, the institutes or academia and the industry. So, any any person who graduated, he do, he, he's probably a great, like, you know, computer engineer or something, but he's lacking the game u, like, you know, the the grit of a game developer or something. So, that's why uh, three years back, we have started a program called Pixel. So, Pixel program is one of, like, you know, one of the very unique programs at Game District, where we, like, you know, after the graduation, we give them, like, you know, a chance to build their skills uh, skills according to the uh, like, you know, industry standards. So, they got to know about the retentions and what what the right execution of a game would be and everything. So, this, this, this is the program we have been really passionate about, and every year we are doing, like, you know, from 50 to 100, like, you know, guys, like, you know, getting in there, and they just, like, you know, polish their skill. So, it's not only related to game uh, development, it's related to, like, you know, game design and related to, like, you know, uh, video editing, because, like, you know, now creatives are, it's going to be the big thing. So, we are just, like, you know, doing all the roundups and and and doing this, like, you know, from last three years, and it's been really phenomenal for us.\n\nHuh. Uh, how about, because you said, like, in the beginning, there were not a lot of gaming companies, now there are more gaming companies, and of course, the way you're building your company is pretty perfect to spawn more game companies because of that autonomy approach, and then the problems start happening. There's two or three ways, like, you know, why they are failing. Uh, the first thing is, they are not amazing when it's come to the UA and monetization, but they're great in terms of, like, you know, making games. So, there's a huge opportunity when there is a games which which, like, you know, scaled the western studios sees that, and they see it's a great potential for them to improve the monetization and improve the UA, and they can, like, you know, just, like, you know, take it to the moon. So, can you talk to these elements or other elements, like timing, talent, funding, infrastructure, culture, um, what, what do you think is the bottleneck, and what is you think is a great driver for Pakistan? I think, I think timing-wise, we, we are okay. I would not say, like, you know, in terms of, like, you know, timing-wise, we are late to the party or something. We, we still have a lot of, like, you know, things to, like, you know, do in terms of timing, and we can, like, you know, improve it with over competitive ads on the cost. So, that would be the first thing when it's come to the timing. The second thing is talent. We have great, great, like, you know, young audience, like, you know, who's, like, you know, coming and who just, like, you know, living the life, going to the colleges and everything, and we are just, like, you know, trying to get them into a right place, which, which can be, like, you know, game industry or the IT services and everything, because, like, you know, Pakistan is an economic struggling country, economically struggling country, and the IT services is the most booming industry in Pakistan. So, that's why, like, you know, all of the young guys and, like, you know, girls, like, you know, coming to the industry, and they wanted to learn, either they wanted to do the services business or they wanted to be in the product side of the world. So, that is one thing. I think talent would not be really problem, but the biggest problem would be, it's, like, you know, the top experienced talent.\n",
