  "cleanText": "[Music]\nThe big news of the week was that Jason Shrier wrote an article basically suggesting that Microsoft plans another major cut at the Xbox division of Microsoft that's supposedly going to happen next week.\nAnd so it just got me motivated to actually finally write the article that I've been trying to write for a while and publish it.\nAnd actually, unfortunately, Joseph Kim like beat me to it.\nBut anyway, nonetheless, as I've said a million times on this podcast, and I've been talking about this way too much, is that Microsoft's whole strategy has been a train wreck from the get-go, right?\nAnd so, what I wanted to articulate in this article is why they have failed succinctly.\nAnd I wish I write more on LinkedIn because it actually got has like 30,000 views already in like less than 24 hours.\nAll right.\nSo why is Microsoft failing is most important and what they can do in order to improve it.\nRight?\nOne, Game Pass is missing the mark.\nThey are less than 40 million subs and it's nowhere near their 100 million people target.\nAnd the whole point of a subscription is to scale it so that you can justify like giving away content, right?\nSo this is not happening.\nTheir hardware share is absolutely cratered.\nLike they are just not competitive anymore.\nThey're less than 30% of the console market versus Sony.\nAnd then if you add Nintendo in there, devastating loss for them.\nBut software is the biggest red flag because software is where they make all their money.\nLike this is a razor razor blade business.\nAnd all the margin that they get from third party software that's cratering, right?\nSo they are less than 14% share against Sony and even worse against Nintendo.\nCloud gaming feature on the box, right?\nThat is not expanding the market.\nIt is not removing friction at all.\nWell, that is a complete loss leader for them.\nThat is a product that that doesn't even make sense.\nAnd then the cross-platform promise is broken as well.\nLike all the PR about bringing to mobile that is not working, right?\nPeople are not playing Xbox on a iPhone, right?\nThat's not happening.\nThat will never happen.\nThere's a stupid idea that was all PR to get this deal done.\nIt had nothing to do with like the reality of what consumers want, right?\nAnd then finally, AI is actually bad for Xbox, right?\nBecause AI is what Microsoft is focused on.\nThey don't give a about Xbox, right?\nIt is not part of their core strategy, as I've said a million times, and it doesn't make sense to have this as part of it.\nThe only push back I keep getting on this is that the player data that they gain from Xbox could help them build out their LLMs, which may be true, but they're not doing that now, as far as I can tell.\nAnd also, it's a privacy nightmare for them.\nSo, what my solution is, spin out Xbox now, right?\nDo it now before we have a death of a thousand cuts of this that you guys are doing.\nLayoff after layoff after layoff, destroying the Halo teams, cutting all these other teams like this.\nIt's got to stop.\nAnd if you do this now, you might might save like the business holistically.\nHaving said that, there are a lot of challenges again with this.\nSo, become an independent company to keep compete head-to-head with Sony.\nSunset Game Pass.\nGet rid of Game Pass alto together and just create a normal sub for like catalog and other Maybe some exclusives over time or timed exclusives, but none of this like day and date like release exclusive thing.\nThat's not going to work.\nAnd then bring back exclusives, right?\nEverything will be exclusive to Xbox.\nObviously, they can't do that with Call of Duty because it's contractual and they have all these legal issues, but make a very specific experience on Xbox that differentiates it from other platforms for Call of Duty.\nKill the Series S.\nThe Series S was a dumb idea from the get-go.\nThat is like kept them in the dark ages of game development for since the launch.\nAlmost half of their units have been Series S, which are not a capable device.\nAnd then then license it to third parties, right?\nAnd then go public, right?\nThis would be a huge publicly traded company.\nThis would be Activision 2.0 with hardware, right?\nA pure play gaming company, right?\nAnd giving them the flexibility to do crazy things like Joseph suggested of buying Epic, which will never happen because it will never sell.\nBut nonetheless, that gives them the much more flexibility to do what they need to do as a standalone gaming entity.\nThe alternative, keep it at Microsoft, right?\nIt avoids like the short-term pain of a major reorg and lots of like changes and big strategy pivot, but it also guarantees like this quiet decline of the destruction of teams and franchises and it trades disruption for complacency and that path leads straight to death by a thousand cuts.\nThat is the end of my article.\nSo, yes.\nYes.\nWell, so one thing I wanted to ask you that we you didn't talk about was kind of the AMD and the new console announcement.\nSo, basically, I think the last week they came out and said, you know, they're basically continuing the partnership with AMD.\nSo, nothing new here.\nNvidia stopped making console chips for the PS3, I think, was the last time they really did it.\nAnd AMD has been the leader since then.\nSo, let me read Sarah Bond's quote from the announcement.\nThis is all about building you a gaming platform that's always with you so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want.\nDelivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device.\nBond said at the AMD partnership, that's why we are working closely with the Windows team to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming.\nI think they're actually doubling down on staying at Microsoft, going more vertically integrated and not listening to you whatsoever, which is\nNo, no.\nActually, this this doesn't necessarily not align with what I'm saying.\nOkay.\nI think they can execute on this strategy as a standalone operator much better than they can under the Microsoft umbrella.\nRight.\nThe AMD partnership is actually good, but the AMD partnership has been going on since the PS3 days.\nLike the only time Nvidia was yeah a factor was back then.\nSo the subscription is the problem.\nThey need a hardware strategy and this is actually a decent hardware strategy.\nThey partner with AMD to bring the capability to different multiple devices.\nBut then also the integration with Windows is the other thing that's really interesting as well.\nBut I am not objecting to the PC strategy at all.\nLike I think the PC strategy makes sense.\nLike bring Xbox to PC, right?\nWindows 11, all that stuff.\nThey don't need the subscription.\nThe subscriptions are what's killing them right now, right, in terms of profitability.\nSo,\nso I think they are making the right moves.\nThis is the right strategy and even like creating third parties like licensing the tech for handheld devices with the ROG ally.\nYeah.\nRight.\nLike that makes sense too, right?\nIt's small potatoes, but that could make sense in terms of bringing the pricing down from the hardware perspective potentially over time, but that's what they need to be focused on, not like subscription cloud, all this other crap that they've been doing.\nIt's been an absolute like train wreck, right?\nOkay.\nAll right.\nSo, this is an Xbox strategy.\nCrest is approving subscription cloud.\nYes.\nAnd on mobile like and mobile.\nYeah.\nApple and Google.\nYeah.\nNo, that's not happening.\nGot it.\nOkay.\nThis is a stupid idea to spin off.\nThere's no value there.\nYour hardware business is negative margins.\nYou're a giant publisher with really no cohesive core with mobile king just sits around like this is just waiting to be diced and sliced and sold at different places.\nThey're not stronger together than they are separately.\nThat instantly is what happens if there's even a sniffle of this actually being done.\nThere's no way they're going to be held together as a public health company.\nYou know that too.\nThis is why I keep pressing you on what does the P&L look like?\nIt looks like dog\nIt doesn't have to be public.\nIt could be private equity.\nSure, it can be private, but it's not going to be as one entity because that entity sucks under one P&L.\nIt's going to be sold and diced up for its most profitable parts.\nThis is the thing is when I write this article, I am saying what they should do, not what they will do and not what's easy, right?\nLike it's much easier to stay within Microsoft and just die a slow death as they, you know, destroy all value and all teams within the company, right?\nWhich is basically what's happening right now as we speak, like real time, right?\nAnd they have enough money, Microsoft clearly has enough money to keep this thing going for basically forever, right?\nIn order to actually help the gaming business and create more of a dynamic market and to really innovate on the gaming side, they need to be standalone.\nAnd you're right, it's messy, dude.\nAnd it ain't easy and it ain't going to happen, right?\nProbably.\nBut I just want it to happen so that we have a legitimate competitor against Sony and Nintendo and and just basically try to bring it back to the competitor that it used to be before they up that Xbox 360 generation.\nXbox One generation, sorry.\nNintendo and Sony are not even like competitors.\nLike they're kind of like it's normal to have both of the devices, right?\nWhich one?\nSwitch and PlayStation.\nLike they're not substitutes.\nNo.\nCorrect.\nYeah.\nI agree with you.\nActually, Philip, I don't I can't say I disagree with you, dude.\nBut but the fact like having new leadership and I suggest like someone like Frank Chi or Owen Mahoney would be that type of person that maybe could lead this as a publicly traded company.\nThey could actually I think make the changes needed, but it's going to be messy.\nReally messy to your point.\nRight.\nLike All right.\n[Music]\n",
