  "cleanText": "You can't see stress. And I do think stress really messes you up a lot. And sometimes there are, like, I, I do think, um, the Okay, so one, I'll, I'll share something. I'll share two things personal.\n\nSo, you're in Spain. You're now a family man. Is that right? What's going on, Mishka?\n\nI've been a family man for, for like eight years. But like on, on my part, that's, that's a really good question you asked me. Like, just before we started recording, like, are you slowing down? That, that seems the case. How would I put it? Like, I think it's really important to have this phase because my kids are going to be this age for only a very short period of time. Yeah. Um, they, I, I, I want to thank, think, think they need me. Let's put it that way. And for the audience, their mother, can you tell us how old your kids are?\n\nMy, I have two daughters. One is four and the other one is eight. So, they're optimally four and a half years away, just like in the Sapiens book.\n\nYou're like those ages are magical.\n\nYeah. You, you want to...\n\nYeah. And, and now, like, they're all about, you know, being with daddy and so forth. So this is, this is my phase where I'm working less. Before I had kids, I worked six days in a week on the regular, and that was my cheat code. It's like, I just work one day more than anybody else. And that was essentially how Deconstructor of Fun was built.\n\nAll right, so maybe we could tee this up for the audience out there. So we are back, the OG podcasters, myself, Joseph Kim, Mishka Katkoff from Deconstructor of Fun. Today I think we're gonna do like, I think the last time we recorded something together, we did what we call three by three. So just bringing up three topics on my side, three topics on your side. I think we're going to go two by two this time.\n\nIshka and I think we're going to just play it by ear. Right. All right. I, I, I love doing a podcast with you first and foremost because I know you for probably a decade. Uh, right, getting old. I made, I made, I met you in San Francisco in 2016. Almost a decade. Okay. Uh, and, um, and secondly, because you're really good at podcasting. I mean, you run your own podcast. You're the OG of YouTube podcast.\n\nI don't know if I'm that good, but appreciate the compliment. I'll take it.\n\nYou are. Uh, just the, uh, the amount of reps you've done. You, you, that's, that's insane. And then thirdly is because you are not working in a corporation and you are very authentic. You can say what you feel, and that makes, I think, into a good conversation, maybe because I'm in, as you say, the, the slower phase of life and trying to figure out this, this work and life balance. So I've written some of the stuff I was thinking about you and the things that I want to understand that, that would help me to understand what I want to do, how much effort I want to put in. So, uh, without further ado, I wrote this. Okay.\n\nModern hustle culture rewards relentless output. More hours, more goals, more growth. But what starts as ambition often morphs into avoidance. For many high performers, work becomes a place to hide from discomfort. Broken relationships, unsatisfying identities, or fear of stillness. Now again, I'm not writing about you. I'm writing about in general. So the question for you, Joseph, or Joe, is you spent many months in Bangalore. You're right now in Bangalore away from home, really pouring yourself into LILA Games. Do you ever feel like work becomes a way to escape other parts of life, even unintentionally?\n\nProbably, like, unintentionally, that's there. Since I've been here for about a month now, and in this last month, I've had one call with my wife, two calls with my daughter, and that's about it. So, uh, to the point about I'm not intentionally avoiding my family, but there are, I, I would say that when you are locked in on work and then there's like so much stress and problems and there, there's been some [ __ ] going down, just to be real, then, you know, it, it, yeah, the, the family stuff, it, it's almost like out of my mind, and I do think that's a problem. I don't think that that's healthy. But I also, I also think, like, different people are going to view their objectives in life in different ways, right? So, um, for me, I, I actually, I don't know, I, I have this belief in suffering as, as somebody who, um, who, you know, like, I, I read Victor Frankl's Man Search for Meaning once every five years or so, and, um, kind of like the belief that I, I don't think you live a full life without suffering. So there, there's like that suffering aspect, but then also, I, I, I think everyone, everyone in life searches for something. I, I think that any, and I don't know, I may, maybe I can just speak, and, you know, at, at the risk of being a little bit chauvinistic, but I believe all men have kind of this hole in them, and they try to fill it with different things, with purpose in some cases, with, I don't know, whatever, um, you know, with whether it's girlfriends or with alcoholism or something, but it For me, in my experience, there's, there's different objectives and goals that people will have trying to fill that hole. For me, I'm trying to fill it with with an objective, and I've at least told myself that trying to build this company will create something meaningful and valuable. At least that's what I've told myself. Mhm. And maybe that is, um, how I rationalize not spending more time with my family. But I would say I, I, I feel the cost of it for sure. It's not like, you know, I'm not unaware that there is a cost for all the time I spend at work and for doing what I'm doing. And I will say, you know, I, I do question it. You know, when you're, you know, when you're awake at night and you're trying to sleep and you think, \"What the [ __ ] am I doing?\" Like, I'm, I'm human, too, right? I think about it. And I don't know. I mean, I, I haven't met anyone who can grind as much as I do, but I'm not sure if that's a, I'm not sure if that's a good thing.\n\nSo, so have you ever thought about what's the difference between suffering and sacrifice? Do you feel like one leads to another?\n\nUh, I think they're related, but I don't think they're the same thing, right? So, like, um, sacrifice would mean that there, there's like a tradeoff that, like, for me, in, in this case, I'm giving up time with my family. Um, you know, like, I used to, like, when my kids were young, I spent a lot of time teaching them stuff like math and things like that. So, they got really advanced, and then I haven't spent time with them, like, at all on helping them develop. So, you know, my daughter, I, I've spent almost no time with her. I started to, but then I stopped. So the sacrifice there would be that I've traded, you know, what, what I feel, which is like trying to develop my kids and things like that for work. Suffering is just kind of like the pain you feel from going through hard times. And I actually, and for me, I view suffering in a, in, in a better way because I, I, I do think that when you suffer, when there are these problems and challenges and when there's this conflict and tension, that generally, in my opinion, good things happen. Like by working through those problems, you're able to come up with solutions, you're able to have a deeper understanding of different kinds of problems and things like that. So I would say for me, suffering is, you know, I mean, in the extreme, obviously suffering sucks and it's bad, but the general point of having some suffering in your life for growth and development, I think is good. Sacrifice can be sucky.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But sacrifice is, is intentional because sometimes people take the suffering because they think like, let, I'm not putting words in your mouth or or any meaning, but you would say, hey, I'm doing this sacrifice of being months at a time in Bangalore, right? It's away from my family, it's away from the things that I love and I want to be doing, but it's a sacrifice because if I do this right, then I will make it right with my family because the company will be successful and that will have many, you know, financial benefits and so forth that will then unlock these things. So it's sort of a like a, not, it's a sacrifice, even though neither is guaranteed, but do you kind of get into a position where you feel where, where sometimes you would feel that in order to be good at something or, you know, have a positive result, you have to suffer? Like, is, is that the sort of a mental model?\n\nYou know, I actually like the suffering and sacrifice involved with what I'm doing. Now, I don't, I haven't really, like, considered, well, this is going to pay off financially later, so that's what's going to make it up to my family. I haven't even thought about that at all. I, I thought more about the thing that's on my mind is, can I create something valuable and important? And I, the story that I've told myself is that the sacrifice I'm making is because I am working on something valuable and important. And the moment that, um, if, if I were to feel that wasn't happening, then I would feel really shitty. And sometimes I do feel really shitty.\n\nWeb stores, you've seen what good looks like, but have you seen great?

I, I think I like, I, I think it's important to ask you these type of questions because people probably only see the other side of you making the sacrifice of you suffering, but and, and you pushing through it and kind of motivating yourself to put that effort, but they don't see or hear or think because they don't see or hear you self-doubting, uh, you wondering whether this suffering makes sense. They don't kind of maybe understand that that still happens. You just don't talk about it. And, and I think that's an important side of it. And kind of related to that, like, you talked about your kids. You have three beautiful kids and a beautiful wife and a nice, beautiful house in, uh, in the Bay Area. Um, haven't met your kids. Haven't met your wife. Beautiful couple. What do you wish your kids would learn from seeing you suffer for your vision?\n\nWell, I do like, I would love for my kids to pick a problem and go through because I actually do think suffering is good. So having, like, some level of suffering, not too much, but to, to pick a problem and do something where they're creating something valuable, doing, doing something important in, in life, whatever problem that they choose, right? So, uh, that, and I would say a lot of the conversations I have with my kids now is trying to figure out what they're interested in and encouraging them to, like, find something that they feel, you know, some kind of affinity, affinity to so that they can start because whatever it is, you know, if it's like, oh, I want to, I think microplastics are a bad thing. I want to try to solve that problem. Then, you know, we, I can try and help them move into a direction where they can try and work on that problem. That's kind of how I view my relationship with my kids right now. But, you know, it's, it's a little different. And I think I have two older boys, 15 and 13. Um, honestly, like, they're kind of at an age where, you know, I don't think they think their dad's cool. I don't, I haven't even talked to them at all since I've been here. Um, it's only my daughter that misses me and she'll, you'll, she'll send me texts and things like that. So, that's super nice.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So, you know, I, I, I think I, I think it's always the case. Daughters are the best until they become teenagers, and then I think it flips, right? But for right now, she's still...\n\nThey, they say boys are difficult for the first 12 years and daughters are difficult for after the first 12 years, right? I don't know. That's, that's kind of where I'm at now. thing.\n\nAnd so if your, if your one of your sons or your daughter would come in and say, \"Dad, you know, I want to move to another country, preferably third world country, grind for five years on a startup.\" Would you encourage them to do that?\n\nI, I think that I would encourage them to travel. I mean, that's something that for me has opened my eyes to a lot of things. I, I think getting, uh, I, I think a lot of people in the US, once they travel, their perspective on life changes a lot, especially when you travel to a country where there's a lot of, you know, um, disparities in terms of income and where people are not living the best life, and then it's like, oh, like San Francisco.\n\nYeah. Yes. I'll just have them go to San Francisco.\n\nYeah. Um, but yeah, I, I, so I, I, I think I would have them travel for perspective, but I, what I would probably say is if they wanted to go to a third world country for five years, I'd probably just tell them go there for three to six months first and then, and, and then, you know, see what happens. Um, but I also think, like, sometimes us as westerners have these, have these kind of preconceived notions about\n\n\nPeople and things, and that may not be true. Like even me, right? I, I had this, I came to India with this kind of, like, I don't know, this, this perspective that I felt like there, there are, and I don't know, maybe it's, uh, maybe... I don't know what people think about this, but I'm just going to, I'm just going to tell, I'm, I'm just going to say what I think, and people can, people can judge me how they want.\n\nWhen you came in. Yeah. They do that without saying.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So, you know, judge me negatively if you want, but like, I kind of came to India with this notion that there were, there were going to be all these, you know, poor people who were limited in terms of opportunity, and but they were really good people, and if you just gave them the opportunity, that, um, that's all they were missing. And so, like, this, um, I don't know, maybe the savior complex or whatever, uh, coming into India for the first couple years, and we, I tried to, like, give a lot of people opportunities, trust, and things of that nature. But then I think, you know, what I didn't realize is that when you're the, the kind of people that have worked out better here are actually not the really, really poor people who don't have a full education, who don't have opportunities. It's the people who have, who are more educated and who have had, um, strong parenting.\n\nAnd I think if you're poor and you don't have a lot of opportunities, and you're, you were raised to be very transactional, um, you're probably going to, you know, that's how you're thinking. I, I'm not saying it's their fault.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut that's just the reality of life, right? If you're just trying to survive day to day, and you see an opportunity, or you see something, and you know, you can, you can steal, or you can lie, or you can do whatever. Um, I, I just think that the notion I had that, you know, all these poor people are really good-hearted, they just lack opportunity, and, um, and I, I guess I have realized that's not necessarily true. Yeah, it's quite typical for people to see themselves in others and seeing, like, well, if I were in that position of being underprivileged, not having opportunities, and if somebody would come to me to give that opportunity, then I would succeed in that. But you're not that other person. And, and, and that's not to say that there aren't some people like that, but you really got to go through the funnel, right, to find those people.\n\nOf course.\n\nYeah. Of course. Interesting. And would there be anything that you would advise your kids to do differently than you did, other than spending maybe more limited time? You said, like, three to six months first, rather than just headfirst for half a decade.\n\nAdvice if going to another country or just...\n\nYeah. Like, what would you want them to do differently than you did? Like, your kids, kid comes for an advice, and you know, he or she says...\n\nI, I think, like, ultimately, I think it's, it's easiest, well, I mean, there should be pain and suffering, but I think it's better to have a community or a team of really strong, dedicated, you know, kind of like the Alexander Wang notion of gives a [ __ ] kind of people to work together on a hard problem. And it's a lot harder to get a team together that is fully aligned, committed, all that kind of stuff. That takes a long time, and there's going to be a lot of suffering and sacrifice to get to the point where you have a capable team. So, um, I think you could, it, I think it's more efficient in life, and you'll achieve a lot more in life if you can get a team together that is aligned and capable, and, um, and so you're spending more of your time on a challenging problem, rather than spending a lot of your time trying to get the right team and capabilities and skills together.\n\nUh, I think I have wasted a lot of time on the team and skill-building part, and not enough time on challenge, the, you know, the challenges associated with the problem we're trying to solve.\n\nYeah, that, that's very typical for any startup because you're essentially building a team out of, out of nothing, and in your case, your founding team hadn't worked together. Uh, that was my case as well. So that, that creates the longer period of storming and forming.\n\nYeah. And then, and then we picked a very challenging genre relative to the resources we have. Right. So it's like, um...\n\nYeah. I often talk about you go to war with the army. That was the, um, I forget the, um, the, the general's name. Uh, but you go, you go to war with the army you have, not the army you want or you wish you had. Right. So, uh, yeah, that's definitely not tunu.\n\nUm, and, and, yeah, that's a, that's a, that's a very, you know, I, I feel you 100%.\n\nUm, so, like, just, just so this isn't all about me, I, it'd be good to...\n\nI think it's fun when it's all about you. I'm a, I'm a podcaster. I'm used to this. I will just ask you questions for two hours. You'll be like, \"That was a great conversation.\"\n\nLet's get to you. But you know, I, I think, like, some of the topics that I have picked aren't so much about life and things like that, but maybe I'll just, I'll just shift it, and, um, maybe I can ask you some questions. So, you know, you started a company, you, you sold it, you're now in family mode, and so maybe one of the questions I can ask you is, based upon your experience, um, and you were doing a startup, and I, I assumed you were more in hardcore mode at that time relative to now.\n\nYeah. But I, I think I would be interested in, um, what were, like, the biggest lessons from that experience, and if you're going to do it again in the future, what would you change?\n\nYeah. Well, let's start with the, uh, main experiences. So, I came into it very, uh, list, like, with a, how would I put it? I thought it would be much easier than it was. I think everybody does. Every first-time founder would. And I'm basing this on my experience at LILA Games, where we both worked, not at the same time, but consecutively. And what happened at Fun Plus, which is again, I've said this multiple times, but it's the best job I ever had. I, I think the CEO is phenomenal, and, um, the team over there is, is really good. But my experience was such a positive one because 80% of the team actually came from Zinga, uh, where I used to work before. And yes, there was that storming and forming phase as we were building a new team because even though the majority of the people came from the same company, from, not, not the same game team, but they were, like, from the same division, so in, in the same space. Nevertheless, um, that, that storming and forming phase was, was quite rapid, like, a couple of, maybe one, one or two key changes in the core team, and that was it. And then we were flying. And I realized now, just having a conversation with you, is like, that happens with everything, but at Zinga, it just happened while we were there. We were storming and forming for two years, and then we kind of kicked it off again, having had those experiences, knowing how we like to work, how we don't like to work, and, and essentially having that culture without anything being written. Our culture was essentially anti-Zinga. Not anti-Zinga per se as the company, but anti the way we were working as a corporation, kind of slow, everything is written, multiple reviews, rather than whiteboards, conversations, and just, you know, ship fast. So, nothing against Zinga is phenomenal, but just, uh, the way we're working was not suitable for that. So, anyways, um, and because the formation of the studio was so quick, because we worked so incredibly efficiently, uh, because the hiring was easy, like, first tapping into my, uh, contacts, uh, we're able to scale to, uh, to a nice place. You know, it's not quite Bangalore, like, the amount of talent you have in, in San Francisco is, at least used to be a little bit deeper than, than, uh, than what you might have there. And then also, at the same time, like, a year in, Fun Plus released a number one grossing game that further kind of expanded the demand, like, it started with first people thinking that we're working for a money laundering operation to, like, you know, have forming a line outside of our studio, just wanting to, you know, come in for that play test. We, we invited them a few months ago because now we're, you know, banking. Um, so having that experience, that, that really, really positive experience kind of led me to assume that I could do it again just as easily. And that was not the case. You know, in our case, we also put in a lot of stupid, you know, variables that, that didn't need to have there. So, having a founding team that hadn't worked together for, for a longer period of time, everybody had worked with each other, but not everybody had worked together. And so that was an issue, starting two locations at the same time. Uh, being fully remote, not, not fully remote, but kind of like forced to be remote because of, co, unable to travel constantly. There were, like, now you can't travel, now you can't travel, now you can't travel. So, between two different countries, Germany and Finland, that was really challenging, and then, uh, the background of people was different. We had people coming in from AAA and people coming from mobile. So, there was a huge clashes over that. Um, and, you know, it clashes in terms of, like, how do you make games because two very, very different ways of, of, of building. And, and, and, you know, that, that, that storming phase and, and everything, like, what I've learned from that is how important it is to invest into good teams, and what actually a good team looks like. I don't think that many investors, even though they talk about good teams, really understand what a good team is, and that is why they don't do any diligence on that, like, zero. They don't, they, they run for FOMO, they run for CVS, uh, they say words like, oh, very charismatic leader, or I just didn't, you know, it's just so gut-based, and they, it's not even gut-based, the gut is based on somebody else's opinion. So, um, with all due respect towards venture capitalists, um, but you don't invest into schemes, you invest into FO model.\n\nUm, so, so having that understanding has been fundamental now that I'm doing a little bit more angel investing, and, you know, having over 20 companies that I've invested into. Um, really understanding what the team is, and being able to say no based on my conviction of, like, these people haven't worked together. This is too big of a risk. I don't believe this will work out, and being proven right over and over and over again by just having this experience from my past. You know, these superstar teams that kick off, and everybody's happy, and they tell, I'm an idiot because I didn't invest to, you know, talking to them, people who leave that company, like, six to eight months later, just like, oh, it's a chaos because X, Y, and Z. I'm like, yeah, I know. And it will be like that for two hours, and they either die or they grow from that. But anyway, so understanding what a good core team is, founding team, sorry, founding team has been, has been my biggest learning because it's different than in a company. In a company, you hire some people, they work or they don't, you change them around. It's more like managing a sports team. But if you have a founding team, you can't just, you know, kick out a founder. That's a big decision. And you know, we've just had an article about the two-year cliff and the the importance of not having debt equity, etc., etc. Like, it's a, it's like, once you have your founding team, those people essentially are there from this point on to at least four to five years, and then there might be some changes, but these are like your franchise players. And if your franchise players are all from different, they don't know how to play together, they, they're seeing the the future in a little bit different way, your company is going to be [ __ ] for, you know, a good amount of time, and then you figure out or die.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, and that that has been my biggest learning is, like, what is actually a good founding team? It's not, you know, it's not, it's not necessarily the pedigree. It's more about the time together. So, I learned to value a lot of teams that have spent time together, whether, you know, like, the Israeli teams that have been in the military together. Um, teams that have, you know, are, are friends from school, teams that have brothers to, like, I know that they're not going to most likely separate. They've, they've gone through a lot of hard times. So, they have stormed, and now they formed, and now they trust each other, and now they can be those bedrocks that will, you know, um, that, that know how to work together, and you can build around that. So that has been probably the, uh, the biggest learning. Was there another question there? I guess so, if you were to do it differently now...\n\nIs, is the, is the co-founder relationship the main thing that you would try to validate, or is there something else as well that you think about?\n\nYeah. So, so that experience has left, uh, the, the co-founder experience has left a lot of, um, what do you call it, PTSD, and I'm sure every founder, most of the founders you talk to will have that. And so, even, like, after this, there have been, you know, ideas and and projects that that would have wanted me to, um, to be a part of and set up a found, you know, co-founders and so forth, and the way I review this is insane. I, I'm just not jumping in to be a co-founder with anybody, like, like, it's a, we have to really be aligned on the business aspect before we can work. So, what I do now is there's a lot of, like, written documentations that we answer the same questions, and then discuss how much we see difference in, in these things. I don't rush it at all. I'm taking time. If it breaks, then that's good. I'm actually happy that that they don't go through. So, co-founding aspect has been, has been pretty, the kind of thing that I take super, super seriously, just like any business contract. Um, and, and, um, yeah, that, that's the one, like, I'm not, like, I don't get seduced by, by co-founding anything with anybody unless I really know th, those people. I, I respect them, and we go through that process of alignment, um, before that. And where are you at now with respect to, because, like, it seems like you've, you've kind of gone into family mode. You want to spend time with your kids while they're young.\n\nAre you open then to looking at stuff? What would it take for you to, besides a co-founder relationship? Are, are you looking at any specific things now, or you just going to kind of take it easy and just wait for something to come, or how are you thinking about it?\n\nYeah. So, I work with a lot of companies, to be honest. Uh, so, Deconstructor of Fun is, yes, it's a media, and, you know, I have, I have a team of\n\n\nHow many are like seven people?\nSo there, there are, you know, uh, people involved.\nI'm not doing this alone.\nUm, and not just only on the podcasting side.\nI spend most of my time working with various clients.\nSo usually these are mid to large companies, um, gaming, gaming tech, um, government as well.\nSo, so there's, there's, um, you know, I, I, I work a lot with different clients, and, um, most of these contracts that I do are fractional.\nSo I get to be a part of the company, um, for a longer period of time, taking usually some kind of a head position, whether that's one day a week up to four days a week.\nUm, so I am quite active.\nI haven't joined any of these companies full-time.\nUm, mainly because I, I think the fractional role gives me a nice visibility of what working with within the company is.\nIt's almost like a, like a longer trial run.\nYou get to solve a lot of problems.\nYou get to become, you know, very close to the team, to the founders, etc.\nUh, but, but also it's kind of like, because I don't have to commit to a one job, I don't need per se a job.\nI have several.\nUm, I'm incredibly picky.\nNow, will I eventually join one of these companies?\nYeah, 100%.\nBut this time, the way I'm thinking is, is like, it really has to be something where I can use Deconstructor of Fun platform to support it, rather than having Deconstructor of Fun on the side.\nUh, I've learned to really enjoy having this platform.\nI enjoy writing.\nI know you do enjoy writing as well.\nI love doing podcasts.\nLike most, my most of my stuff's AI.\nSo, you, well, okay, I understand that, but you still go through it.\nYou edit.\nIt is your thoughts.\nYou just make it faster with AI prompt.\nYour newsletter is prompted with AI.\nYeah.\nYou [ __ ]\nOh my god.\nOkay.\nWell, I, I, I mean, I use plenty of AI, but I don't, you know, I don't per se prompt.\nI, I might prompt based on my notes to kind of get the first draft in, and then I, I think it's gotten to a point where it's quite good.\nSo, I, I actually read it.\nI'm like, \"Oh, oh, this is cool.\"\nYeah, I'm reading my own newsletter as a new reader.\nI, I, I definitely use, use AI, but not for that.\nLike, I don't, I don't per se prompt it.\nLike, I could, but I feel like I would be cheating myself.\nAnd not, not that, cuz you know, we have plenty of content because we have plenty of content, um, creators, but for me, writing is a big of a learning experience.\nSo I really do want to take my time and think about it and then, uh, write these things.\nBut yeah, like, you know, I might use, I might make all my notes, which is few pages, then prompt it, then do a lot of editing, then let it sit, then come back to it, then change some aspects of it, and so forth.\nSo there's, there's, yeah, I guess the way that I kind of do it is like, I have the transcript that's, you know, auto AI pulled out, and then that goes in, and then the AI will write the from the podcast.\nYeah.\nAnd then, and then I, and then I just read it, and I'm like, \"Oh, cool.\nCool.\"\nI mean, yeah.\nSo, like the things that are more the essay stuff, I will write those.\nThe AI won't write those, but, but like for the, for the, um, for the podcast, Yeah.\nI'm, I'm, I'm reading it for the first time, and you know, I'm, I'm learning stuff, like, \"Oh, yeah.\"\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, so, so that's, I think that those are my, my kind of key learnings is just being, uh, very selective, understanding what is the type of life you want to be living at this phase.\nUm, not jumping to anything head first, which has been my first 30 years, almost 25 years, and then, you know, just taking my time.\nI, I think that's, uh, that, that's been, that's been the, uh, the clear learning.\nNow, what I'm doing, what I don't like about what I'm doing right now is that I have too many clients.\nThat's, uh, that's a problem.\nSo, uh, I think, you know, well, yesterday I just saying no to one.\nIt's like, it's hard to say no to, uh, to, to clients because this is very sort of up and down.\nLike, there might be a month where there's no clients.\nYou're like, \"Where did the clients go?\"\nAnd then there might be the next three months where you just don't have time to eat, cuz there's just too much work at the same time.\nSo, maybe like, like that's, that's been my, my issue, and that's really, uh, I think that's a pricing question.\nJust raise the prices unless until there's less clients and, um, and focus on the ones that, that you work with.\nThat actually came from a client, that idea.\nSo, uh, so, so yeah, so that's, that's been my focus, but my focus has been in the search of focus and not doing too much, which I'm very, uh, prone to do.\nOkay.\nWe're talking about work.\nWe're talking about suffering to kids and so forth.\nAnd, um, and the thing is, like, founders and high performers, if you will, often blur the line between themselves and their work.\nAnd especially this was true to me, and I think it will be true to you, is that when you're having a good day at your startup, um, you feel great.\nAnd when you don't have, when something is going wrong, it kind of affects you.\nLike the work, the, the way your company is going is how you're feeling.\nY.\nAnd so I'm curious, is like, sometimes with these cases, like when the startup fails, you just don't lose a company.\nYou essentially lose yourself because you're so tied to it.\nAnd in a way, you could say that the most dangerous job is the one that defines you.\nSo the question for you that I have is, like, like if LILA Games becomes this billion-dollar success, what will that mean to you?\nNot professionally, but personally.\nGame devs, we know that great gameplay is what players love.\nBut integrating metagame features like challenges, progression, rewards is crucial for

like, you know, I mean, I work all the time.\nI rarely watch any movies.\nI play a game or two.\nI, I don't really spend much money at all.\nSo, like, it for me, like, having a big success for this company would mainly just be an ego thing, but, but also a proxy, proxy for we've done something important or valuable.\nSo, I think if we're able to make a company that, you know, uh, that creates a lot of products that people love, then I would be proud of that.\nI'm, I'm already proud of some of the things that we've done here, where we have, I mean, it, it takes a lot of iterations, but we have some people here who have dramatically improved.\nI'm, I'm proud of that.\nI think the, the financial success of LILA Games, if it makes, you know, like the money part, I won't be able to spend that money just because I, I just don't spend money that much.\nYeah.\nUh, but it would be a pride thing for sure.\nI mean, I'm not, I, I like to think that I'm humble, but, um, I do think if, if something like that, if we had that kind of outcome, I don't think it would really change my lifestyle, but I think, I think I would probably, it, it would be an ego thing more than anything else, which, you know, is, is maybe good or bad.\nI, I don't know.\nBut, um, of course I would love that, and it would be good for my ego.\nI'm not sure.\nBut what do you mean an ego thing?\nLike, what, what do you, what, just like, haha, I have a, you know, I made a billion-dollar company.\nSo, so the game maker's email comes the next time, and it says, \"I told you so,\" or like, never got, like that, yeah, that's more of a, yeah, I mean, I'm just being honest, that's it'd be an ego thing, wouldn't really change my lifestyle much, um, but, you know, of course, but then it'd also hopefully be like validation and proxy for having created some value in the world.\nSo, you know, I, I think that would, that would be, that would be it, really.\nH, interesting.\nUm, it's, um, yeah, I, I, you know, I've talked to some founders who had good exits, and, um, I, I rarely talk about this, but I remember talking to, to one of my friends, and, and he's, he asked me kind of like, \"Did anything change for you?\"\nLike, \"No.\"\nAnd then he was like, \"Yes, right, nothing, like nothing changes.\"\nAnd I think that, I think we put in so much sort of a hope and dreams into those situations that, you know, it keeps us going, like, once that happens, like, then everything is going to change, and everything is going to be this and that, whatever we hope for, but in reality, I, I don't think much changes, actually.\nLike, we're, we're just being ourselves, and kind of like, regarding that, I wanted to, I don't know, I will say personal, say, just, just being real, there, there are some friends I have where, you know, a financial outcome has changed them a lot.\nIn, like, in what sense?\nUh, one, I would say, in some cases, they think they're the expert on everything.\nUm, you check, check their social media, it's like, \"Hawaii, Vegas, Hawaii, Vegas, Hawaii, Vegas.\"\nIt's just like, you know, there's, there's one guy who just disappeared.\nHe's just gone.\nYeah.\nLike, what happened?\nHe's just gone.\nOh, he's, he's sleeping in Egyptian cotton.\nYou know how hard it is to, you know, rise up from that and grind?\nI'm, I'm not sure if the typical scenario, if you have a major commercial outcome, would be nothing changes.\nI, I'm sure it is, like, maybe, maybe for some people it would be that.\nUm, well, let's say, well, let's say it's not a major, like, it's not like 100 mil or more, but it's more like, you know, in a single digit million.\nYeah, the, the dude that disappeared, a Bitcoin guy, so, yeah.\nYeah, I know, I know, like, that's a, I, I, yeah, of course, I know a couple of those.\nI was mainly talking about maybe like a single digit where it's like, you know, Yeah.\nI think with that, I mean, single digit, it's not private jet money.\nYeah.\nRight.\nYeah.\nI don't know.\nYeah.\nAnd I guess it just depends on the person and depends on, um, yeah, probably the scale of it would might, might, might change the situation.\nH, do you, do you think, um, that success, that ego boost of, of success of, of, you know, let's say LILA Games is that billion-dollar company, do you think that will fill, I don't know, of the same hole you kind of talked about, like, not being at home and, and not talking to your kids?\nUm, would, would that help to fill that hole or that sacrifice?\nI don't think a commercial outcome would do it, because I think that if I feel, and you know, I kind of talked about this before, but one of the reasons why I even started this company was based upon the Clayton Christensen essay, \"How Will You Measure Your Life?\"\nAnd so I would still view it as, okay, you know, end of my, I imagine myself on my deathbed, looking back, what would I, you know, would I feel proud of the life that I lived and accomplishments that I've had?\nUm, so if I had a commercial outcome, but I didn't do anything with it, I'd still feel like I need to do something.\nSo then I probably try to deploy that cash in some way to do something.\nI, I think you would still work as hard as ever.\nI'd probably still work hard.\nI, but it would depend, like, right now, like, coming off of the last, I mean, I'm, I'm almost coming up on five years of this.\nSo, I would say, uh, you know, if I had a commercial outcome, like, right now, I'd probably take a break and then kind of recommit.\nBut, you know, at, I, I can't, I, I can't go seven days for, you know, there, there's only, I mean, everyone has their own specific break points, but yeah, I mean, I probably take a little bit of a break before coming back in.\nIt, it's, um, I have this weird thing.\nI'm probably never told about this to anybody.\nSo, uh, we have, um, in our house, we have this sort of like a lofty thing.\nSo, it's a, you know, it's a loft.\nAnd when we bought the house, it had this like full-on, like a gaming setup on the loft.\nSo, it's almost like a, it's almost like a living gaming room.\nThe guy had built it, and it's like above the living room.\nSo, it's really cool.\nAnd I was like, \"Damn.\"\nAnd I was in a startup mode.\nI'm like, \"Damn it.\nLike, we're going to buy this house, and when we finally exit the company, I will, I will, you know, spend time here just playing games and just, you know, just enjoying, because I don't have time to play a console.\"\nAnd I [ __ ] you not, I never played a console there even after.\nLike, never.\nAnd it's, it's kind of crazy.\nWe're selling the house right now.\nSo, that's, that's also some of the things where I'm thinking about, like, nothing changed.\nI even got a console for free with a ton of games, and I never played it in that place, which is the one of the reasons why I bought the entire house.\nI see.\nIt's, it's like the work never ends.\nLike, you are what you are, and you know, just worked as hard as ever and and took no breaks.\nWell, let, let me ask you a question then, related to this.\nUm, since we're going deep in philosophical, I was going to talk about a lot of tactical company problems, but okay.\nUm, so let's, so let, let me ask you that same question.\nIf you were like, imagine you're on your deathbed, Mishka, and you're looking back on your life, what would you say you're most proud of?\nOr what do you think you could do from now to make you feel that you\n\n\nAre you proud of your life?\nYeah, this is nothing new. I actually do this almost, uh, more, more, sorry, uh, I almost do this on a daily basis. I have this um, really meme that I found.\nOkay.\nYeah, I know. Well, uh, you were in a grind mode. I had this meme that I, that I, that I saw on Instagram. Uh, there was a tombstone and on the tombstone it read, \"He worked really hard.\"\nAnd the, the whole idea, I think the way I read it is like, that's, you know, like you want to leave a little bit more than people saying that you work like a, like a man, and um, and I kind of judge my days based on that. Now, like yesterday was not a good day for me. I worked really, really hard almost the whole day, took a little break to watch our eldest one, uh, sorry, the younger one, and then again I worked till midnight and felt like that was a shitty day because I didn't have the control of my own life or my own schedule. I was, I was doing with others, and even when I was present with my kids, I wasn't present, and so I deem that as a bad day, even though in terms of, you know, works, it was a productive day. So, um, sorry. What was the question? Like, I kind of, kind of drift away.\nYeah. I, I guess I was asking if you were to imagine yourself on your deathbed. Yeah. Yeah. And so, and so, okay. So that's, that's where I'm going. Thank you for reminding. And so, kind of portraying that a little bit more. Uh, something that I worked with a therapist with also that I used is, um, I think it's important to have the bucket list thing, the things that you want to do. And for me, like when I was doing that, they were quite simple, and a lot of them had to do with stuff you're doing with friends, with the places you want to visit. You know, there are achievements that you want to do, and I've definitely been doing a good progress against those, but I have done a poor progress in terms of spending time with, uh, with, with friends, especially with, with the busy life. And, and so for me, it's like, it's almost like the ending has to be the same way as I view a perfect day, and a perfect day for me, I think we talked with Brett Novak about this, like we have a exact same perfect day, like we want to work a little bit, even though it's a weekend or whatnot.\nPerfect day for me is wake up early when nobody is out, and I can make my big pot of coffee, and I can do some work, usually writing for me, whether I'm writing stuff for client, whether I'm writing, um, something for Deconstructor of Fun, some of my thoughts, kind of spend three, four hours on really focused work, then I like to spend time with my family, I like to spend time, uh, working out, and, uh, and I like to spend again more time with, with the family, kind of, you know, finishing up, uh, the day, watching a movie, like we watch Minecraft movie. First time watching a movie as a, as four of us in like four years because, you know, our oldest is, is old enough now.\nBut that is sort of a perfect day for me, and the way I would extrapolate it to my whole life, I wanted to be balanced, and I know that people talk about work-life balance, like you need to achieve balance in every day, and I know that that is not the way it works. There are days when you need to work a lot more, where you don't have balance, like, like yesterday, and then there are days when you kind of figure out that balance, where you're spending the whole day with the family, and then you're going with your, your other friends and doing, you know, activities, and now that's, that's a different type of thing. And so, in, in my deathbed, I wish I could have a more balanced experience, where I worked enough, achieved enough of those things left, you know, the industry better than, than when I came to it. And I think what we both are doing is helpful for that. We're sharing a lot of information, a lot of insights. And, you know, I, I at least have been gotten over a decade, people coming to me and saying, \"Thank you, because of DoF, I got the job or got this or got that.\" So that's a positive thing, but I also want to want to be loved by my friends and by my family, and I don't want to sacrifice that for more admiration from people who I don't know, who I've never met, who might say a nice thing once in, in a comment section or, or, um, or at an event, like that is not nearly as important.\nAnd so now where I'm at is, in order to have a meeting with me, like, like, dude, the way I'm viewing things is like, this is away from my time with my four-year-old. So is this meeting really that important? So that, that's how I've cleared really a lot of my evenings and everything. And I know that this is just a phase, and the next phase will come when they're a little bit older and their dad is not cool anymore. And then I'm going to be again super focused on achieving career goals and, and marriage goals and, and, and so forth. So I've, I've sacrificed a lot, and, uh, that sacrifice has not been mine alone, and my wife has had to take a lot of it as well. So, you know, the same kind of crazy [ __ ] that you've probably done is like, working on holidays, waking up early, doing things, and kind of putting stress on others because of your work.\nAnd I want to, and I've been, I've been able to pay that back actually quite a lot. I've worked from home, which I don't enjoy, uh, for two years already, just giving my wife ability to go to her office every day. That has helped her a lot. Um, you know, spending more time with kids, taking in practices and so forth. So I've been able to rebalance, and I want that to be my goal, where I was able to, when you would do the audit on my life, there's a, there's a balance. There were phases where I worked too much. There are phases where I worked too little, but spent too much time with.\nSo you want, you want to have a good family life, but also create some value for other people, and but you want, you want to kind of do both, basically.\nYeah. I, I don't want to be the type of guy who whose kids don't know him. I don't want to be the type of guy who doesn't have friends, just colleagues. Uh, I don't want to be the guy who doesn't have a wife. Uh, I don't want to be a guy who's a loser at work, but has everything else either. Uh, and that is a hard balance, and I'm not saying you can achieve that on, on a daily basis, and I'm, I'm saying that you can't actually, and, uh, and that's why I consider life in phases, and I think it's good to understand that this is the type of phase, and I try to repeat that to myself. I'm not saying that I get this, but I try to repeat to myself like, \"Hey, man, like, don't to take too much on because you're in a different phase.\" And I fail at that often times, where I have too much work, and then that causes, you know, the PTSD to flare up with my wife and others, like, you're constantly working, and then I have to sit her down like, \"No, I'm not. Look at my calendar.\" Like, I've, I've gotten away from that. But, but that's, that's really the point.\nAnd, and kind of going through, through the, uh, through my stupid bucket list, like I have [ __ ] there that, that are very achievable, and it's like, well, why don't you just do it? And it's like, well, it's like, it's like, you know,\nAll right, so can I add one nuance here and let me get your take on this? So I actually have, so okay, so compared to you, I'm a little bit different because like, for me, I, I'm, I'm viewing, I'm viewing life more from the perspective of like, my high score. Okay, if you imagine life as a game, and you know, we're probably in a simulation, I think, right? But like, oh, and, and so for me, the score is what value did I create? And right now, I, I honestly don't think I've got a very high score. So, I want to get that up. Well, I, a number of reasons, but, um, but I, I guess the, the, the other nuance I wanted to add here is like, when I think about, like, even if I wanted, I, I think the pressure that I'm also feeling right now when it comes to, when we think about work, work, and balance is that I believe, and you, you may disagree with me on this, but if AI, we can't have a conversation without talking about AI, but if super intelligence is for real, and who knows, a lot of people think it is, then is this the last chance for us to work hard? And two, if AI is for real, the other thing I think is that within the next two years, there's going to be a massive distribution between the halves and have nots. It's going to be parallel distribution. And that if you don't grind now over the next two years, you're going to either be a winner with AI or you're going to be a loser without AI. What do you think of that perspective?\nI think it's, uh, like you remember when blue collar workers were losing their jobs and [ __ ] in cities were like, \"Oh, just learn to code,\" you know, and they were like, \"No big deal, this is how the economy changed,\" like, \"Maybe we just don't need this type of job,\" like, \"Yeah, there's robots and automation and stuff like that,\" and we didn't make a big deal out of that, we just let people suffer, and now that white collars are losing their job because of AI and blue collars are not, then suddenly this is the end of the world as we know it. It's like, um, meanwhile, the blue collar is like, \"Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool, like I can, you know, do, do my travel plans.\"\nSo I think, you know, I think we are going through a, through a major change in, in how white collar employees do their work, people like ourselves. Uh, I've seen mainly positive impact from AI in my line of work. I'm sure you as well. Anything from podcast editing to, to writing to, you know, consulting work has been made much simpler.\nYeah.\nAllowing us to be more productive and, uh, generate more revenue. So it has been quite productive. Um, but you know, I view it as, as any kind of, I don't believe in this, like, now is the two years where you need to grind. Grind for what? Like, where, what do you, if you don't know what the future is, how can you get ahead of things? And so, yeah, I'm teaching my, my kids to, to do manual labor. That's what I'm like, \"Oh, my girl is not too, my eldest is not too great in math.\" Like, she's now in taekwondo camp, and she's phenomenal in sports. I'm like, \"Yes, this is something that AI will not be able to do. It's gymnastics AI.\" I'm like, \"You like doing hair, girl?\" Oh my god.\nCuz if you, um, you know, it's, um, sounds like a safe profession. If it was a boy, I would teach. Oh, talking about plumbing.\nNo, I'm seriously considering, like, maybe trying to, like, own a cafe or restaurant or something because, like, yeah, cuz I, you won't compete against. Seems like blue color work is, is the way to go. Um, again, not, not thinking about too much future, but, but it, it, it has made it easier. Even like, even with kids, even I'm not that stressed that she's not the best in academia. I'm, I'm super happy that she's really great in, in, in arts and craft and sports. Like, that's, that's amazing. You like working with your hands, you have a bright future ahead of you. And that would be different, uh, maybe a decade ago, like, we need to hire a tutor for math. I'm like, \"No, we don't. That's useless.\"\nYeah. I, yeah. It's hard to say. I, I do think one of the things now is that there's just so much uncertainty, right? Like,\nYeah. And that's why, if Elon's successful with Optimus, there's not going to be any blue collar work either, right?\nYeah. Yeah. You know, we, and, and so I'm, what is this? Is this stoicism where you, where you can, where you think and worry about the things you can impact, and you just don't think about things you have no impact over? I think it's the same thing here. I think I wish I would be watching less news as well because I, you know, I somehow is like super entertained by, especially geopolitics, and then I'm thinking about, like, \"Oh, I wonder if this country has a future now because of XYZ.\" I'm like, \"Why do you even think about that? Just [ __ ] let it go. Don't watch news. Don't read [ __ ] about AI, how it's, you know, we're all in simulation or it's going to take our jobs or it's going to do this.\" It's like, you're just creating these, you know, these worries that you have no impact over. So, I'm, I'd like to be more of a reactive than proactive and, and getting ahead of something I don't even know.\nOkay. Yeah. I, I think what I've been doing is just learning as much as I can and studying and being very active with tools, and then we're, we're building a bunch of stuff with AI now. But, yeah, of course, I mean, we are as well, like, we've, we launched one AI product, and we're kind of like, it was okay, but then we're pivoting to another thing, um, with, with within DoF, like, we're, we're actually doing stuff around AI. So it, so it's not, again, it, it, I don't think it's being proactive. It's more being reactive on what's there in the market and building against that. But at the same time, like, you know, how was it Meta Conference speaking and, and Google as well? They're, they're all labeling me as like anti-AI just because I'm not foaming out of mouth. They're talking about how everybody needs to work with AI right now. For them, it makes sense. Their whole business is, is about now selling AI products, and they can't, for the, for the life of God, tell them what benefits is there right now for the companies other than incremental. So they're using fearmongering to force companies to adopt AI to figure out what is the best case to use the products that they're selling. That's essentially it, and it's working. Uh, so good on them. Um, I'm, I'm being very reactive, really looking at what, what's there, trying different things, um, and not trying to get ahead of something I don't know.\nAs they say in the army, never be the first or the last. It's key. Still works in business.\nAll right.\nYeah. So, I got one question for you.\nSure.\nFinal one.\nOkay.\nSo, you've been very, you've written or had AI write. I think the, the personal essay stuff I write, but I'm actually going to take that out of my newsletter.\n\n\nI'm just going to go more podcast stuff on the Game Makers.\nWell, I'm going to start a different newsletter and then uh just keep my personal stuff separate.\nOkay.\nSo, either of you have written and spoken quite openly about the founder journey, um about the hard times.\nYou have videos that are, you know, quite raw.\nSo what are the something personal you haven't shared about, you know, how lonely it has been or how difficult the role of a startup CEO has been?\nWhat have I not shared?\nUm, something personal.\nI will say like you can't see stress, and I do think stress really messes you up a lot, and sometimes there are like I I do think um the okay, so one, I'll share something, I'll share two things personal.\nWhy not?\nSo, one, do you remember when Silicon Valley Bank went down?\nMhm.\nSo, we had all of our stress, we had all of our money in Silicon Valley Bank, everything.\nAnd when it went down, I remember I called my wife and I told her, uh, we lost all our money.\nOh, like your family money, not\nNo, no, no, no.\nOur our company money.\nSo, I called her from India and I'm like, hey, you know, we had all our money in Silicon Valley Bank and I said, uh, she was just finally and I told her, I'm I'm so glad and I'm I'm ready to come home now.\nAnd yeah, I was really happy.\nI can imagine it somebody somebody put the quit button for you.\nAnd and then I think that then after that the the day that um cuz cuz for me it was like you know well the investors have entrusted with this money.\nI have to see this through.\nBut when I thought Silicon Valley Bank went down it's like okay, I can just close this down.\nYou lost you lost and it wasn't your fault.\nAnd I was I was happy.\nI know.\nUm so that's one.\nThe second thing is as I was mentioning about stress, I mean it it does have a lot of physical impacts.\nI remember it was like uh I will say there are a lot of things that you just can't I don't know it it I do think stress has a way of impacting you in like really weird ways.\nUm so there was like this week uh like it this was like probably uh towards the end of last year and I was in India and I remember like for two weeks and you know I mean I I don't want to sound like a I don't want to sound like a like a like a wuss, but like but like for like two to five minutes every day I would just cry.\nI don't know what what was going on, but it was like so much stress or something was going on.\nYeah, it was me up.\nSo like and I was like, what is going on?\nBut I'd just be walking and then I just start crying for a few minutes and I was like, what?\nAnd then it'd stop.\nSo I do think like I I feel like you know there there there are to to the point on suffering it can when it does lead to stress it can have you know a dramatic impact I think on your health, on your emotions, things like that.\nUm yeah, emotions especially.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nMental health is huge.\nYeah.\nSo, I mean, I I would say, you know, I mean, this year I feel a lot I mean, I trust me, I've got I got problems up the ass still, but it's because of the coffee anyways you've been doing, but I I do feel a lot better and I I I have reduced my level of stress.\nI'm not sure if I've reduced fully.\nYou know, we still have a lot of problems and things like that.\nUm, but you know, uh, stress is a is a big deal.\nYeah.\nI I I don't know if I told anybody this either.\nI remember this was at Gamescom.\nIt was a startup mode and I had panic attack several nights.\nI didn't know it was a panic attack.\nSo, what was happening is I would wake up in the middle of the night and it was insane chest pain.\nLike a chest muscle pain, okay?\nAnd it wasn't like a heart but chest muscle.\nIt I couldn't sleep cuz it was just like killing me.\nAnd I would stretch in the middle of a night and I was like what the is going like did I do bench press vlog or something.\nI was like I don't like I don't know.\nLike I would wake up several nights in the middle of the night with insane chest pain and I was googling the and it was under panic attack and I was going through some crazy stress and and it was just causing those kind of things like I had panic attacks because of stress.\nI never would have.\nAnd and so kind of like both of our experiences, I'm pretty vocal on LinkedIn to that are encouraging others to be founders and entrepreneurs.\nLike shut the up.\nLike this is not a rosy road.\nIt's so crazy to even, you know, oh, just go for it.\nYou could do it.\nAnybody shut the up.\nLike you're you're putting people on such an insane roller coaster of\nUh for what?\nAnd it's also equally bad when women kind of some women on on on on LinkedIn are just like, you know, blaming that they don't get to take part in this horrific show known as startup culture where 99% of companies fail.\nYou lose your health, you lose your wealth, you lose everything, you lose your relationships.\nIt's like, we want to be a part of that, too.\nShe's like, no you don't.\nAnd you're the smart one.\nThat's why there's no women.\nLike there's so little amount of women in this because they are smart.\nMen are stupid.\nThat's what they do.\nMen climb on a mountain that has nothing on top and you may very well die by doing it.\nAnd they're like, \"That sounds like a thing I need to be doing right now.\"\nLike that's, you know, don't mean to be misogynist.\nLike I talk about this with my Family and you know, she's like so happy to be an executive at a tech company rather do this\nAnd when people tell her like, \"Hey, you should, you know, do out founders.\"\nShe's like, \"Shut the up.\nI know exactly what it is.\nI'm super happy where I'm at.\nLike, I don't need that nonsense.\nSo, does that mean you're not going to go back in or\nSo, or or will you or or I I thought you were going to kind of orient towards investment.\nIs that\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI am, you know, um I am doing that.\nUm it's it's been taking a little bit longer than than expected and the market has definitely shifted, but that's that's definitely has been one of the the focus area that I'm building towards.\nUm, I'm I I am going to be in company building 100%.\nI'm that type of a stupid that I need to do this again, you know, and it's it's ludicrous and I don't recommend it to anybody.\nI'm like a rabbi, you know, where somebody trying to, you know, convert, I'm like, are you nuts?\nGet the out of here.\nLike, this is the worst religion you can find.\nSo, so the same the same thing.\nAnd then if you try over and over and over again, I'm like, \"Okay, it seems like you have something here.\nLet's let's work with this.\"\nAnd this way I'm probably going through this, you know, the next phase as well.\nIt's like I'm looking at bunch of bunch of uh options, working on some of them, seeing where it leads, but I'm not in the phase where I believe you have to suffer to succeed.\nI'm I've been watching a lot of these like sports documentaries.\nThe quarterbacks has been phenomenal.\nBy the way, I don't know anything about American football, but quarterbacks has been amazing on Netflix.\nAnd what you can see with with the people and actually they did a study on tennis players and they found out that the the top 25 compared to the top 100 eat the same, train the same, equal effort, everything is the same, but the uh the way they approach the game is different.\nthe top 25 when they fail, they're like, \"God damn it.\nAll right, let me see what's gonna happen in the the next match or in the next ball.\"\nAnd the ones who are not in 25 kind of get broken down by the success and they're so, you know, holding the the bat hard and kind of need to succeed and super aggressive and and really focused and and I think that sort of approach where you let it come naturally is really important.\nThat's what I wanted to happen in my in my next endeavor as well.\nThe same as it happened in in Fun Plus where it felt natural.\nIt felt that everything was clicking and felt that we could do anything.\nThere was very little interpersonal and it was all about solving the problems that exist in the product.\nUm that's that's the way I want to I want to work so with very like-minded people um focusing on you know on profitable growth over venture-backed insanity.\nAll right.\nWell, I guess with that, Mishka, this is not the direction I thought this conversation was gonna go, but it never it's all good.\nAll good.\nAnd uh you know I I definitely wish you good luck on um sounds like what even ahead of the opportunity and the things that you're finding is probably finding as you mentioned before the right co-founding team and having that chemistry together.\nUh if anyone's listening to this and wants to, you know, hook up with Mishka to\nI already, I'll be honest, I don't have time.\nLike you can hook up, you can email me.\nI work with already with with several companies.\nUm and if I don't know you, I'm not going to start a company with you, just to be clear.\nSo there's there's no chance in hell of that happening.\nSo it's it's it's working with the ones that I have.\nAnd um and you never know.\nI might join a company that has already passed the the early stages and the scaling um just because I I was able to deliver them a lot of value.\nI believe in what they're doing and um yeah that could that could happen.\nSo that's why I am fractional.\nIt allows me to work with a bunch of different teams and and uh help them and as well help myself to find my path.\nBut for you, I wish also all the best.\nWhether that is success of this game, failure of this game and success of the next one because your back is against the wall or whether is even if it's the ending as you said, you were happy when you lost your money for a while because that allowed you to walk away.\nUm, I know exactly how you feel and there's not nothing to be ashamed of.\nIt is insanely difficult path and I wish that at the end of the path on your deathbed as you always like to be very very\nI've never the deathbed sounds so crazy but at the end you'd be happy with what you achieved as a professional but also as a father and I think you are incorrect when you say that you haven't given enough back.\nI think you have I think you continue to do.\nYour newsletter is very good.\nYou share very insightful information.\nYou employ a lot of people.\nUm what's there not that you're not giving back.\nSo I think uh I think you should reconsider what you've done.\nI appreciate that.\nI'm still trying, still fighting.\nAnd uh yeah, until the next time.\nUh we'll do uh another I don't know how many this was.\n2 by 2, 3x3.\nWe'll do something.\nIt was just a podcast.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nJust\nExactly.\nThat you you sent me the AI prompted question.\nI said, \"Joe, we're not doing this.\nWe are not doing this.\nWe're having a podcast.\"\nAwesome.\nAll right.\nAll right, Joe.\nHave a great time in good old Bangalore.\nNever coming there.\nI don't know.\nMaybe I might, but um we'll see you one day.\nYeah.\nI'm just not into, you know, stomach flu and my pants.\nSo All right, no offense, mind the advance.\nAll right, have a have a a good one.\nAll right, byebye.\nYou did it.\nYou made it to
