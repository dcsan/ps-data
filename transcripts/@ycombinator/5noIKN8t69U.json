  "cleanText": "Since we recorded this Lightcone episode with Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Meta has agreed to invest over $14 billion in Scale, valuing the company at $29 billion. Alex has also announced he will lead Meta's new AI super intelligence lab. Our conversation you're about to hear covers the history leading up to this investment. From Scale's early days at YC to its integral role in the training of foundational models. Let's get to it. The AI industry really continues to suffer from a lack of uh very hard evals and very hard tests that show really like the frontier of model capabilities. The biggest thing is you just have to really really really care. When you interview people or when you interact with people, you can tell people who are just sort of like phone it in versus people who sort of like hang on to their work. It's like the so incredibly monumental and forceful and important to them that they do great work. Very exciting time to see the how the frontier of human knowledge expands.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome to another episode of the Light Cone. Today we have a real treat. It's Alexandr Wang of Scale AI. Jared, you worked with uh Alexander way back in the beginning actually. Uh what was that like? What year was it? Put us in the spot. Yeah, Alex. I mean, most of what we want to talk about today is like what Scale is doing now because like the the current stuff is like so so awesome and so interesting since Scale got started at YC. I thought it just seemed appropriate to start all the way at the start. And um you it's funny uh Diane and I were at MIT last month talking to college students and like of all the founders, the one that they like most look up to and like want to emulate is actually you. Like everybody wants to be the next Alexandr Wang. Everybody knows the story of how you like dropped out of MIT and and ended up starting Scale, but they don't know the real story. And so I thought it'd be cool to go back to the beginning and just talk about the real story of how you ended up dropping out of MIT and starting Scale. So before I went to MIT, I worked at um Quora for a year. And so this is 2015 to 2016 or no sorry 2014 to 2015 was when I worked as a software engineer and this was already at a point in the market where ML engineers as they were called or like machine learning engineers uh made more than software engineers. So that was already like the market state at that point. I went to these summer camps um that were that were organized by um by rationalists the rationality community in San Francisco. So um and they were for precocious teams but they were organized by um uh many people who have become pivotal in the AI industry. So one of the organizers is this guy Paul Cristiano who um used to uh who's the inventor of RHF actually and now he run or he's a research director at the U.S. AI safety institute. He was at opening for a long time. Um Greg Brockman came and gave a speech at one point. Eleazar Yudkowski came and gave a speech at one point and actually I was very like when I was I don't know must have been uh 16 I was exposed to this concept that like potentially the most important thing to work on in my lifetime was AI and AI safety. So something I was exposed to very early very early on. So then when I went to MIT I was started MIT when I was 18. I like studied AI quite deeply. That was most of what I did in the sort of day job. and then um uh kind of got antsy applied to YC and then the idea was kind of like okay how could initially was like okay where can you apply um sort of like AI to things and this was um in the era of chat bots which is like crazy to think about actually um that there was like this like mini chatbot bubble boom yeah yeah yeah 100% in uh in 2016 um which is uh which was I guess spurred by magic right? Or or some of these apps and and uh Facebook had a big vision around chat bots. And anyway, there's this little mini chatbot boom. So, the initial thing that we wanted to work on uh and um was was chat bots for doctors, right?\nWhich is like a funny idea because do you guys know anything about doctors?\nYeah. No, not at all. um like basically no I it was just sort of like oh doctors are a thing that sound expensive and so and I think it was like I think it's like indicative of like I mean I don't know you guys see this all the time but I feel like most of the times young founders like first 10 ideas are like always first of all they're very mimemetic so they're probably like there's a lot of like the same ideas over there's like a dating app there's like some something for like you know social life you know there's the same ideas um and then I think that like I think young people have a very poor sense sense of alpha like what are what are the things that they're actually like going to be uniquely positioned to do and I think you know most young people don't have a sense of self so it's you know it's not clear so when we were in YC we were roommates with uh with um with another YC uh company and we were sort of like um we were sort of observing this like this like chatbot boom ahead of you know that was happening at the time um and but it was very clear that like um chat bots if you wanted to build them, and this is funny to say in retrospect, required lots of data um and required lots of like human elbow grease um to be able to get them to work effectively. And so like just like kind of off the cuff at one point was like, oh, like what if you just did that? What if you just did the data and the the like language data and the the human data so to speak for the chatbot companies? We were also very lost, by the way. I think you probably remember we we were we were quite lost mid batch. um uh and like many YC companies I think and so then we um switched to this like concept I think the you know the initial idea was like API for um for human tasks or something along those lines and uh and one night I was just like trolling around for domains scaleappi.com was available and then we just bought it we launched it I think a week later we product hunt yeah I remember the the product hunt page is still live I was reading it last night and I remembered the tagline line. It was an API for human labor. Like that that that that's my recollection of sort of like the like distilled insight that you had was like what if there is an a what if you could call a human with like an API? Yeah. And that was I mean I think it was like 3 days for us to put up the landing page. It launched on product hunt. I think this idea captured some amount of imagination of the like of the startup community at the time because it was sort of like this weird form of futurism where you have like humans delegated like APIs delegate to humans in this in this interesting way. It's like an inversion of the Yes. Yeah. Humans doing work for the machines instead of the other way around. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny because the the initial phase, you know, we sort of we just worked with all these engineers who reached out to us from um from that product hunt which was a real grab of use cases, but then that was enough for us to raise money at the time and like you know uh and to get going and then a few months after that uh we it became clear that like self-driving cars was actually the first major application that we needed to focus on. And so there were many uh very big decisions I would say in the first like year or so of the company. One thing that was curious is at that point there were other solutions that were already the game in town like mechanical turk from Amazon was sort of the thing that people were using but you ended up capturing this whole other set of people that didn't know about it and you had a way better API and you kind of won. Yeah. It was not clear at that point because you probably were compared a lot with mechanical turd. Yeah. So, Mechanical Turk was definitely the sort of like um the concept in most people's mind at the time. I mean, it was just it was kind of one of these things where I think a lot of people had heard about it, but anyone who had used it knew it was just awful.\nAnd so, it's like whenever you're in a space and that's kind of the like that's like the thing. It's like people mention a thing, but it sucks, that's usually like a pretty good sign. Um, and so that was that was enough to give us like early confidence. But then I think the thing that like really I would say the the um the thing that was as actually fundamental to the success of the the company was actually focusing on this like on this like seemingly very narrow problem of of self-driving cars. I think that um you know I remember very early on when it was maybe like six months after we were out of YC basically um there was another YC company Cruz that that had reached out to us on our website and sort of like in the blink of an eye they became our largest customer and they found you just from your launch or yeah just yeah I think maybe even Google like I it's not even totally obvious but just yeah vaguely from our launch and vaguely it was actually an YC founder that uh was working at Cruise that reached out to us so maybe some YC mumbo jumbo.\nWe're a ketti. Yeah. Uh, who knows? The world works in mysterious ways, but and so they grew very very large. So then early on we made this decision and I remember we we we um went to our lead investor at the time and you know we had this conversation. It's like hey actually we think we should probably just focus on this self-driving thing. You know it was actually a very interesting conversation because the reaction was like oh that's just like obviously way too small a market. um then like you you know you're never going to build like a gigantic business that way. Um and we were like we think it's probably a much bigger market than than you think it is because there's like you know all these self-driving companies are getting crazy amounts of funding and the automotive companies are doing huge programs in self-driving and it clearly is the future. Like it feels like something that that um that should exist and so we're like if we focus on it we think we can build like build the business much more quickly. And it's funny looking back because both things are true. It is both true that it enabled us to build the business to be to get to scale pretty very quickly and it is also true that that was not a big enough market to sustain a gigantic business. The story of Scale in many ways is like this progression of like how do you continue you know AI is this incredibly dynamic space. Um, lots of things are constantly changing and um, a lot of I think what um, what we pride ourselves on at the company is how we've been able to um, continue building on and and um, contributing to this very fastmoving industry. When did you uh, become much more aware of the scaling laws because you know uh, one of the interesting facts that sort of emerged is that uh, you're a little bit the Jensen Huang of data. I think that in self-driving\num scaling laws were not really a thing. Um because and the fundamental the the biggest reason actually was that like one of the biggest problems in self-driving is that your whole algorithm needs to run on the car and so you're very constrained by the amount of compute you have access to and is available to you. So like a lot of the engineers and a lot of the companies working on self-driving never really thought about scaling laws. They were just all thinking about like, okay, how do you keep grinding these algorithms to be better and better better that are like small enough to fit onto these um onto these cars? But then we started working with OpenAI in 2019. This was like GPD2 era. Um and I would say like GPT1\nGPT was sort of like this curiosity. GPD2. Um, I remember OpenAI like they would have a booth at these like large AI conferences and they would like, you know, their demo would be to allow researchers to like talk to GPD2 and it was like\nmildly like it was it wasn't like particularly impressive, but it was like kind of cool. is like kind of this thing and then um I think by GPG3\nuh it was sort of this like that's when the scaling loss clearly um you know felt very real and that was I mean I think GPD3 was 2020 um so which is actually like long before before the world caught on to what was happening did did you know as early as 2020 did did you have a strong inkling that this was really going to be like the next big chapter of Scale or not until chat GPT took off was was 35 or was it four? I think that like um in 2020 I think it was clear that scaling laws were going to be a big thing, but it was still not totally obvious. you I remember this like interaction, you know, I I got early access to GPD3 and then it was like in the playground and then I I was like playing with it with a friend of mine and uh I I told the friend of mine, \"Oh, you can like talk to this model.\" And during the conversation, um uh my friend got like visibly frustrated and angry at the AI, but in a way that wasn't just like, \"Oh, this is a dumb like toy.\" It was like it was in a way that was like somewhat personal. And that's when I was I realized like whoa, this is like somehow qualitatively different from anything that had existed before. I feel like it was passing the touring test at that point. Kind of. It was like semblances. Yeah, semblance. It was like sort of like the the the glimpses of it potentially passing the touring test, right? But I think the thing that really\num caused the recognition of I would say generative AI, which is still even the term in some ways, it was really Dolly I think that that um that convinced um that convinced everyone. But I think I think my my personal um journey was like GBD3\nlike was like highly interesting and then and so it was like one of many bets at the company and then in 2022\nover the course of Dolly and and then um and then later chatbt and you know um GP4 etc. and we worked with open eye on instruct GBT which is kind of the precursor to chat GBT. it became very obvious that that was like the at the farm moment for the for the company and for frankly the world. That's when we saw it as well with the big shift in companies because it was that 3.5 moment release end of uh 2022 and we started seeing a bunch of companies and smart people changing directions and pivoting their companies in 2023 and that was that moment this dynamic that you referenced which is kind of the you know scales the NVIDIA for data kind of thing. Um I think that became quite obvious. Um I would say GPD4 really\n\n\nWow, this is like scaling laws are very real.\nThe need for data will basically, you know, grow to consume, you know, all available information and knowledge that humans have.\nAnd so, um, it was like, \"Wow, this is this is like this like astronomically large opportunity.\"\nYeah, for the first time, it seemed like it was something that you could uh get to not hallucinate basically ever.\nYou could actually have a zero uh hallucination experience in limited domains, which is where we're still sort of in that regime even at this point.\nYou know, the classic view is that if it's hallucinating, you're not giving it the correct data in the prompt or context, or uh you're trying to do too much in one step.\nYeah.\nI mean, I think like the reasoning paradigm is is is has a lot of lags, and it's actually been interesting this last era of the of model improvement because um uh the gains are not really coming from pre-training, um which is so so we're like moving on to a new scaling curve of of reasoning and reinforcement learning, but it's it's like shockingly effective.\nUm, and I think that, you know, it's the the analogies between like AI and and Moore's law are pretty clear, which is like, you know, you'll get on different like technical curves, but like if you zoom way out, it'll just be feel like this like smooth improvement of models.\nOne of the things that uh has been popping up with some of the like really big well-known rappers is they're getting access to full parameter finetunes of the base models, especially the frontier base closed source models.\nIs that like a big part of your business or you know something that people are sort of coming to you for, just like these verticalized full parameter fine-tuned like data sets?\nYeah, I think this is going to be a like blueprint for the future, right?\nSo right now, I mean, like the total number of large-scale parameter fine-tuned or reinforcement fine-tuned models is like still pretty small, but if you kind of think about it like that, like one version of the future is that every firm's core IP is actually their specialized model or their own fine-tuned model, and just in the same way that like, you know, today you would generally think that the co the the uh IP of most tech companies is their codebase, um in the future you would generally think that their their specialized IP might be the model that powers all of their all their internal um workflows.\nAnd what are the special things they can add on top?\nWell, they can add on um data and environments that are somehow specific, very, very specific to the day-to-day problems or information or challenges or business problems that they see um on a day-to-day level.\nAnd that's the kind of like really gritty real-world information that, you know, nobody else will have because nobody else is like doing the same the exact same business motion as them.\nThere's a lot of weird tension in that though.\nUm, I remember uh friends of ours from one of the top model companies came by and they were like, \"Hey, do you think YC and YC companies would give us their evals so we could train against it?\"\nAnd we were like, \"No, dude, what are you talking about?\nWhy, why would they do that?\"\nBecause that's like their moat.\nAnd then I guess now that based on this conversation, it's actually, I mean, evals are pretty important as a part of RL cycles.\nAnd then even the evals are not really uh the valuable part.\nThe valuable part is actually the like properly fine-tuned model for your data set and your set of, you know, sort of problems.\nYeah, it's like these Lego blocks, right?\nIf you have the data and you have the environments and then you have the you have, you know, a base model, you like, you know, can stack those on top of each other, get get a fine-tuned model, and obviously the evals are important.\nThis is some of the tension, and this is basically, you know, in a nutshell, the sort of like um does AGI become a Borg that just sort of like swallows the whole economy in like, you know, has one firm, or do you still have a specialized economy?\nMy belief, generally speaking, is that you you still do have a specialized economy, like the like these models are platforms, but the like like alpha in the modern world will be determined by, you know, to what degree you're able to sort of like encapsulate your business problems into data sets or environments that are then conducive towards building like, you know, differentiated models or differentiated AI capabilities.\nYeah, that's why asking for evals was so crazy to me because it's like, \"Okay, you get the evals, the base model is way better,\" and then not, you know, now all your competitors have exactly uh the same thing that used to be your advantage.\nI think we will undergo a process in AI where we learn what the bright lines are, right?\nI mean, I think that like it's like very obvious and intuitive to tech companies that they should not give away their codebase and they should not give away their database.\nLike they should not give away their data, they should not give away their codebase.\nThe analogies of that in a, you know, highly AI-fueled economy, I think, will identify over time, but are yeah, the evals, your data, your environments, etc.\nI think you have a very uh techno-optimistic view of what the future is going to be with how jobs are going to be shaped.\nCan you talk more about that?\nBecause I think you hinted at it before.\nIt's going to be more specialized.\nIt's not that all these jobs are going to go away, right?\nFirst off, it's undeniably true that we're we're uh at the beginning of an era of like a new a new way of working, like like, you know, this there's this term that people have used a long time, which is like the future of work.\nWell, uh we are like entering the future of work or the certainly the next era, and so work fundamentally will change, but I do think um humans own the future, and we we are we are like uh we have a lot of agency actually and a lot of a lot of choice in how this sort of like reformatting of of work or how the reformatting of sort of like workflows ends up playing out.\nYou know, I think you kind of see this play out in uh in coding right now.\nAnd I think coding in some ways is is really the sort of like um case study for other fields and and other, you know, other areas of work where sort of the the initial phase is this sort of like assistant style thing where um you know, you're kind of doing your work and then the models are kind of like assisting you a little bit here and there, and then you go to a, you know, the sort of like cursor agent mode kind of thing where you're you're like um synchronously asking the the models to like carry out these workflows and you're sort of like you're you're managing like one agent kind of or you're sort of like you're kind of like pair programming with a single agent, and then and then now with like codecs or other systems, like it's it's very clear the paradigm is like, \"Oh, you have this like you have this like swarm of agents that you're going to deploy on like all these various tasks, and you're just going to like sort of like, you know, dep like um give all these tasks, and you'll have this sort of like um this this cohort of of agents that are sort of like, you know, doing this work that you you think is appropriate.\"\nAnd that last job um uh has a has a semantic meaning in the in the current workforce.\nIt's a manager.\nYou know, you're basically managing this sort of like this set of agents to do um actual work.\nAnd so and and I think that like AGI or, you know, AGI or doomers or whatnot, like they take this view that like, \"Oh, even this job of like managing the agents will just be done by the agents.\nSo like humans will be taken out of the of the process entirely.\"\nBut our belief, my personal belief, is that, you know, this is um management is very complicated.\nUm, management is also like more about like what's the vision that you have and what's the sort of like what's the like end result you're aiming towards, and those will be fundamentally, I think, like, you know, we have a human demand and human desired-driven economy.\nSo those will be driven by humans.\nAnd so I think the terminal state of the economy is just is large-scale humans manage agents in a nutshell.\nI have a funny story where um a founder friend of mine is trying to promote uh one of his, you know, junior employees, but they're really, really smart, and they're working on the agent infrastructure, and then he was like, \"Hey, do you want to like, you know, I'm looking for someone who could step into management.\nYou've never managed people before, or do you, you know, if we hired some people uh under you, like how would you feel about that?\"\nAnd uh this, you know, uh mid-20-something really smart, you know, sort of do, he's just like, he's an engineer, and he's like, \"Why would I do that?\nLike, just give me like more compute.\nLike, you know, the model, like, look at what just happened to the model literally like last month, and you know, I didn't have to do anything, it just started doing things that it couldn't do a month ago.\nWhy would I want to manage people?\nLike, just give me like, I will just manage more agents, and it's fine.\"\nOkay.\nSo, what are the unique things that that um that humans will do over time?\nI mean, I think this like this like element of vision um is very important.\nThis element of like kind of like debugging or sort of like um fixing when things go wrong.\nLike most of a manager's job, speaking as a manager, is is just like putting out fires, dealing with problems, dealing with like like issues that come up.\nLike I think intuitively, you know, I the idealistic manager job seems like this very cushy job because you're like, \"Oh yeah, all the other people do all the work, and I'm just sort of like I just vaguely supervise,\" and then the reality is obviously like highly chaotic.\nI think people often jump to this like, you know, extreme reality where it's like, \"Oh yeah, these like, you know, you're just going to manage the agents, and you're going to sort of like live this like, you know, kind of Victorian life where all your problems are solved.\"\nBut but no, I think it's still going to be pretty complicated, like getting agents to like coordinate well with one another and like coordinating the workflows and and and debugging the issues that come up.\nLike these are still complicated issues, and you know, having seen what happened in self-driving, which was more or less that like, you know, it's easy to get to 90%, very, very hard to get to 99%, I think that like something similar will happen as with large-scale agent deployments, and that like, you know, final 10% of accuracy will be like, you know, will require a lot of work.\nYeah.\nEven for uh self-driving cars right now, there's the remote assist for all these super edge cases.\nSo there's still a human at the end managing the car.\nYeah.\nAnd the ratio, by the way, I mean, um the companies don't publish them, but I think the ratio is something like five cars to to one teley operator, um or or maybe even less than, maybe three cars per teley operator.\nSo um the ratio is like, you know, much lower than people think.\nI think that like humans are much more involved even in self-driving cars than I think most people appreciate.\nI mean, which if you put it in that perspective, I think it's still very optimistic.\nIt's just the output of getting rides instead of doing in today's world, if you're a Uber driver, you just do one car.\nIn this world, you can do five cars, right?\nWell, you have to believe for this like for an optimistic version of the future where, you know, unemployment is still low, etc.\nYou just have to believe that humans are like almost insatiable in their desire and their demand.\nUm, and that like, you know, prices will go down, things will become, you know, uh the the economy will become more efficient, and we'll just like want more.\nAnd I think this has been a pretty reliable trend for like the history of humanity is that like, you know, um we have somewhat insatiable demand.\nUm, and so I have I have like conviction that like, you know, the economy can kind of get as efficient as it needs or as it like can get like hyper hyperefficient, and then human demand will just like continue to sort of like fill the bucket.\nYeah.\nIn the 20th century, uh you know, when you said computer, maybe early 20th century, people didn't think of like a computer as it is today.\nThey thought of a human being that would sit in front of a punch card tabulator, and that was like what a computer was doing.\nI mean, title.\nIt was literally that was a real person's job.\nAnd then of course, now today it's like, \"Where are all the computers?\"\nWell, they're actually real computers now.\nI don't know.\nIt's that was the Apollo mission.\nIt was a bunch of uh people just crunching numbers with the trajectories of uh of the Apollo, and that was it because the uh computer that went on the uh rocket is actually was a microcontroller with I think only like single-digit hertz.\nIt was like very tiny amount of computations.\nIt was just humans doing it.\nTotally.\nAnd and even this like, I mean, I think the concept of being a programmer is somewhat is like highly esoteric um in the sense that like, \"Oh, you're like writing the instructions for these like machines to just like, you know, just continue do repetitively,\" and in some ways it's like the leverage boost that all humans will get is like similar to the leverage boost that like programmers have had historically for a long time.\nI think a like a lot of people in Silicon Valley say this, like the the the closest thing to alchemy in our world pre-AI, let's say, is programming because you sort of like you can do something that uh creates like like an infinite there's these infinite replicas of whatever you build, and they can sort of like run an infinite number of times, and um and I think the entire human workforce will soon see that kind that large of a leverage boost, which is extremely exciting because I think that like programmers are are are um have like benefited over the past few decades from this like unique perch where they they have like, you know, one 10x or 100x engineer can like can build something like absolutely incredible and like very, very valuable and like very um uh shockingly productive, and all of a sudden I think like like humans in all trades, I think, will like gain this like level of leverage.\nAlex, I'm curious to return to a point that you made earlier about like how Scale AI has kept reinventing itself.\nIf you had to like describe the arc of Scale AI, like what's what's what's the story and what were the turning points?\nOur initial business was all around um, you know, producing data um, you know, generating data for various AI applications and primarily self-driving car companies, right?\nFor for the early years, it was really like you're saying, you're really focused on on that.\nYeah, for the first like three years, fully focused on that.\nOne of the properties of focusing on that business of building that business is over time, you know, we had this like obligation to really like get ahead of most of\n\n\nThe waves of AI, if that makes sense, because, you know, for AI to be successful in any vertical area, it needed data. So, like, our demand for our products would precede a lot of times the actual sort of like evolution of AI into those industries. So, you know, as an example, we started working with OpenAI on language models in 2019. Um, we started working with the DoD on government AI applications, um, and defense AI applications in 2020. This is like long before, I think, the, you know, recent sort of like drone-fueled, um, you know, AI, uh, AI craze in the in the Department of Defense. We started working with enterprises long before, um, there was sort of like this, uh, you know, the recent sort of like larger waves around, uh, enterprise AI implementation. So, um, almost, uh, uh, sort of systemically or or intrinsically, we've had to, uh, basically build ahead of the waves of AI. I think this is actually quite similar to Nvidia. You know, whenever like Jensen gives his annual presentations about, you know, Nvidia and its two trends outlook, like he always is so ahead of the trends. Um, and that's because he has to get there on the trend before the trend can even happen. That's I think been one, um, one way in which our businesses continue to adapt because AI is like this, you know, it's this, this like, it's the fastest moving industry, I think, ever, um, in the history of the world. And so, you know, that each, each turn, um, each evolution, uh, has been, has moved incredibly quickly.\n\nThe other thing that that happened late 2021, early 2022, um, we started working on, um, applications, and so we started building out, uh, AI-based applications, and now, much more so, uh, agentic workflows and agentic applications, um, for enterprises and government customers. And this was an interesting evolution of our business because, because historically, like our core business is highly operational. You know, we build this like data foundry. We have all these processes to produce data. Um, it's a very operational process that involves like lots of humans and human experts to be able to produce data with quality control systems in place. That highly operational business, um, and the success of that business is what created the momentum for us to, you know, sort of dream about building an applications business. When we went into it, uh, I had studied other businesses that had basically successfully, um, added on very different businesses, and what are sort of like the unique traits or or why do some of those work? And one of them that is probably the most interesting, um, I think, is like the most singular in modern, uh, modern business history is, um, Amazon building AWS. You know, if in 2000, you had written a short story that said that, like, you know, this large online retailer would build this like large-scale cloud computing rent to server business, like it would seem like nonsensical. I remember when they launched AWS in 2006, Amazon stock went down because all the analysts thought it was such a terrible idea. It had never been done before. It just like, it doesn't seem related at all to their core business. Um, it has, it's like this like weird thing, but the sort of like wisdom of that was, I think, twofold. I think, like, first, um, and, uh, from talking to people who are like there at the out, you know, the sort of like the genesis moment of this business, like one thing, probably the most important thing, was that they had conviction that that the, the sort of like underlying business model of AWS would basically be this like, this like infinitely large and growing market, like that market would, would literally grow forever. There would be like this like exponential of the amount of compute that needed built up, needed to be built up in the world, and, um, if you did that, there was like sufficient cost of, you know, cost advantages from economies of scale. I think like startups, you know, you kind of like, um, uh, you kind of have to like switch modes at a certain point where, like, early on, you're trying to go for very, very narrow markets, like almost the narrowest markets you can, and then you're just trying to like gain momentum, and then sort of like slowly grow out from those hyper-narrow markets, and then, um, at some point, you, if you like have ambitions to be a hundred billion dollar company or more, then you have to sort of like switch gears and say, where are the infinite markets, um, and how do you build towards those infinite markets? And so, um, this was sort of like, uh, the moment where we realized that, and, and the simple realization was that every business and every organization was just going to have to reformat their entire businesses, um, with AI-driven technology, um, and now, obviously, like agent-driven technology, and that would just be like, over time, that would swallow the entire economy. And so it was like another one of these, like, okay, that's an infinite business to build out AI applications and AI deployments for large enterprises and governments.\n\nI think a lot of people don't realize that you guys are in the middle of this transformation. They still think of Scale AI as the data labeling company, but like, if you fast forward 10 years, do you think most of Scale will actually be the agent business?\n\nYeah, it's it's growing much faster at this point. And I think it, it, it's an infinite market. So the crappy thing about most markets is that they have like a pretty shallow S-curve. Um, but then, you know, you look at hyperscalers or like, you know, these like mega-cap tech companies, and they just have like these like ridiculously large markets. So you really want to get into these, these, these like, um, infinite markets. So our strategy so far has been to focus on building use cases for, you know, focus on a small number of customers and, um, and be quite selective. So we work with, you know, the number one pharma company in the world, the number one telco in the world, the number one, uh, bank, the number one, um, healthcare provider, um, and we work a lot with the U.S. government, you know, the Department of Defense and and other government agencies, and, um, the whole thing is like, how do we take a very focused approach towards building, um, stuff that resemble, you know, real differentiated AI capabilities? And all this, I think, sounds somewhat trite, but, but, um, we have this multi-million business in building all these applications. By my account, I think it's, it's one of the largest AI application businesses, um, in the industry. Certainly what our investors tell us, and it's fueled by our differentiation in the data business because our belief fundamentally is that, um, kind of what we talked about before, the, the end state for every enterprise or every organization is, um, some form of specialization, um, imbued to them by their own data. Our day jobs historically have been producing highly differentiated data for, you know, these like large-scale model builders in the world, and then we can apply that wisdom and that capability and those operational capabilities towards enterprises and their unique problem sets, and, um, and give them specialized applications. Honestly, like it kind of sounds like Palantir here at the like most zoomed out level if you sort of like squint, and that you're a technology provider. We're like a technology provider to like the most, you know, some of the largest organizations in the world, um, with a focus on data. Yeah. Um, and I think the key difference is like, you know, Palantir, um, has built a real focus around these data ontologies and, um, and really solving this like messy like data integration problem for enterprises. Um, and then our whole viewpoint is like, what is the like most strategic data that will enable differentiation for your AI strategy, and how do we like generate or harness that data from within your enterprise towards developing that? I guess you will end up being pretty big competitors in another 5, 10 years, but for now, like, it's basically so greenfield, honestly. I mean, I think it's an infinitely large market. The other, so you might not ever meet, actually, which is interesting.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I, I think in practice now, we actually, like, frankly, we work, we're more partnered with Palantir than than competitive with them. Yeah. Um, and, uh, well, that's because the problems at these giant organizations are actually so massive and intractable that they'd throw up their hands. It's like, they have no shot at ever hiring people who could possibly solve the problem. Uh, but a company like Scale or a company like Palantir can actually hire kind of the same kind of people who would apply to YC, actually. It's kind of like there's this. Yeah. I don't know, the, the through line in my head right now is realizing, like, you know, there's plenty of capital, and then the limiting agent is actually really great technical, smart people who, uh, are optimistic and actually work really hard. There's like not enough of those people. That's true for the world. And by the way, I think one of the cool things about, um, agents, as we were talking about before, is that like, all of a sudden, those people get near infinite leverage. So, um, I think we're going to, I think that bottleneck gets exploded now, hopefully, um, due to, due to AI.\n\nAgain, I, I think, you know, just like how in cloud, AWS is the largest by far, but there's so many other cloud providers that actually are all at like, like it's not a winner take all kind of business per se, and it doesn't have to be.\n\nYeah. Exactly. And, and, and I think that, um, it's just too big of a market to even be close to winner takes all. Like, I just, there's no single organization that could have the organi, um, operational breadth to be able to, to swallow the whole market.\n\nTalking about, uh, operations, you clearly are living in the future, which is super cool. I'm sure you're running Scale AI with all these agents and tools already to make it very efficient. Could you share some of the things that you're doing internally as a company and agents you're adopting so you can do more with less people?\n\nYou know, we saw this early because, uh, when, when the model developers were starting to develop agents and starting to develop using reinforcement learning, like actual, you know, like reasoning models where the, the models could actually like really do end-to-end workflows, we were, uh, responsible for producing a lot of the data sets that enabled, um, the agents to get there, and then we saw just like how effective that, that training process is. I think that like the efficacy of reinforcement learning for, um, for agent deployments is like, is pretty insane. So then once we realize that, we realize like, okay, if you can actually, like, you know, turn, um, existing human-driven workflows into environments and and data for reinforcement learning, um, then you have this ability to convert these like human workflows into human workflows, um, especially ones where you're like, okay, with some level of fault, faultiness and and okay with a certain level of reliability, you can convert those into, um, into agentic workflows. So there's all sorts of like, you know, agent workflows that that happen in our hiring processes and happen, um, in our quality control processes and happen to sort of just like automate away certain like data analyses, um, and data processes, as well as like various like sales reporting, like it's sort of like embedded at, you know, every major org of the company. Um, and the whole thing is like, um, it's just like mindset, like, can you identify these like very repetitive human workflows and basically like undergo this process where you convert that into data sets that enable you to build automation tools?\n\nWhat do these data sets actually look like? I mean, for browser use, is it an environment, and then, you know, here's a video of a human being going through this process of like filling out this form and decide like yes, no on this, uh, drop down or something? I mean, you know, what's a concrete example just for the audience?\n\nOne of the processes that we go through is like, you know, you, you, um, you'll take a sort of like full packet of a from a candidate, and you'll like want to distill that into like, you know, a brief of some sort that sort of like gives all the salient details about that candidate for like decision by a sort of like broader committee. Um, and these kinds of cases, you know, broadly speaking, like deep research plus kind of things are like the lowest hanging fruit. It's just sort of like, can you take these processes that like more or less look like, you know, you have to like click around a bunch of places and pull a bunch of pieces of information and then blend them together and then p produce some analysis on top of that? Like that process, that fundamental like information-driven sort of like analysis process is the easiest thing to to drive via workloads, and the kinds of data you need are just like, you know, um, uh, you, we call them kind of environments, but usually it's just like, what is the task, what is the the full, um, sort of like data set that's necessary to conduct that task, and, um, what is like the rubric for how how you conduct that effectively?\n\nDo you need RL and fine-tuning when like prompt engineering and metaprompting seems so good?\n\nI think that, yeah, I mean, I think I think prompting, I mean, as the models get better, prompting will get better, but like prompting gets you to a certain level, and then reinforcement learning gets you beyond that level. And, um, actually, this is a good point. I, I think that like, probably most of the time in our in our business, it's mostly prompting that just is like works really well. I mean, that's the weird thing is like, oh, shoot, you don't have to crack open the models, and then frankly, like the next models are going to be so good, and then the evals are mainly about picking which model or, you know, at what point do you switch to the next one. I do think startups need basically like a strategy for how they like will, um, walk up the complexity curve, so to speak. Like you need to like, you, you know, whatever product or business you build, like needs to like really, um, benefit from like the ability to like race up this complexity curve, which is the broad broader curve of capability of the models.\n\nI mean, you, you actually created this, uh, leaderboard that has a lot of these super hard tasks that are trying to go into this next curve of, uh, reasoning. Can you tell us about it?\n\nOne of the things that we built, um, in partnership with the Center for Safety is Humanity's Last Exam. It was a funny name. I think unfortunately, there will be yet another exam beyond it. But, you know, the idea was how, like, let's effectively work with, you know, the the the smartest scientists in the field, and, you know, um, you know, we worked with many very brilliant professors, but also very many like individual researchers who are like quite brilliant, um, and we just collated and aggregated this data set of what the smartest researchers in the world would say the hardest scientific problems they've worked on recently are. They solved them or they sort of like came to the right, you know, they were able to solve the problems, but they're sort of like the hardest problems that they're aware of and know of.\n\nI was curious how you came up with these problems.\n\nSo, each of the professors contributed new problems. So, these are not, these are problems that have never appeared in any textbook or any exam ever. They just like came out of their brains and they like typed up like a new problem like from scratch. Am I understanding this right?\n\nYeah. Yeah. And the the general guidance was like, you know, what has come up recently in your research that you think is like a, is a particularly hard problem, right? The problems are stupidly hard, incidentally. They're like insane. I don't know if you guys have looked at these problems. They're totally crazy.\n\n\nYeah, it's totally crazy. And by the way, like they cannot be searched on the internet. It's like you need to have a lot of expertise and actually think about them for quite a long time. They require a lot of reason. I'm recently, like, uh, right now, so we have a time limit where the models um can only think for, I think, it's 15 minutes or 30 minutes, and one of the most recent requests from one of the labs was, like, can you please increase that time limit to, like, a day so that the model has, like, up to a day to think about the um, to think about the problems? Um, but yeah, no, they're deviously hard problems unless you have expertise in the specific problem, you probably don't have a chance of getting it right. Um, but even this evaluation, like, I think when we first launched it, um, you know, and this was just earlier this year, uh, the the best models were scoring, like, 7%, 8% on it. Now the best models score north of 20%. It's moved really, really quickly, and I think, you know, I think, uh, do you think we're going to get a benchmark saturation for this one as well? I think eventually, yeah, it'll be saturated, and then we have to move on to new evaluations. I mean, I think the, like, uh, the the saving grace for the naming was that it is the last exam. The new eval will be sort of like real-world tasks, real-world activities, which are sort of like fundamentally fuzzier and more complicated. Have you solved any of the problems yourself, Alexandr? I know I know you were a competitive math person for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. The I mean the math problems require a lot of, they're like very deep in the fields. I think uh, I was I managed to get a handful, but like most of them are like hopeless. Um, yeah, I looked at the ones that the models can solve.\n\nSo that was that was one of the evals, and we we've produced a number of other evaluations, but um, but yeah, I think that, like, the the in the AI industry really, I think, um, continues to suffer from a lack of uh, very hard evals and very hard tests that show really, like, the frontier of of um, model capabilities. And these eval, when you get when you build an eval that sort of like becomes popular in the industry, it has this like deeper effect, which is that that's all of a sudden the like northstar and the yardstick that that researchers are trying to um, optimize for. And so it's it's actually this like very gratifying activity. You know, we built Humanity's Last Exam. Um, you know, most of the, like, all the model providers, um, you know, will always report their their their results. There's like tons of researchers who are really motivated by by doing a good job. I mean, it's it's uh, and and the models are going to get, you know, deviously good at, like, you know, frontier research problems. I guess Sam's starting to talk about, you know, that sort of stage four innovators of AGI is coming, and you know, that's the prognostication for the next year. Do you think that's, you know, correct, the next 12 to 24 months is like really the moment that literally new scientific breakthrough um is coming from the operation of reasoning and these models? I mean, I think it's super plausible, you know, in fields like biology, and this is probably one of the ones that comes up the most, but there's like there's probably intuitions that the models have about biology that humans don't even have um because it's just, you know, they have this like different form of intelligence, right? And so, you'd expect there to be some areas and some fields where the models um have have some fundamental deep advantage versus humans. And so, I think it's like very realistic to expect in those fields. Biology I think is sort of like the clearest one for me. Kind of already happened for chemistry. Last year the Nobel Prize went to uh the Google team, Dez and John Jumper with Alpha Fold. Yeah, exactly. That was like a huge jump. Before that there was like this competition where um they were trying to get more protein fold structures that were going to get solved, and it was like abysmal, and Alphafold destroyed it. It's a strange time to be a scientist, but an exciting time for science. There's this um uh short story. It talks about this future where, like, you know, there's uh effectively AIs that are like that are conducting all the frontier of R&D research, and um and scientists, you know, what scientists do is they just sort of like look at the discoveries that the AIs make and sort of like try to understand them. Yeah. I mean I think that like very exciting time to to see the how the frontier of human knowledge expands, and then I mean I think that'll be great because in areas like um in biology will fuel breakthroughs in medicine and healthcare and and all these other and all these other things, and then the majority of the economy will will chug along, you know, giving humans what they want. China open sourcing or Deepseek open sourcing their models is like another very interesting question, like how does that play out? And um, and there's this awkward sort of thing that, you know, the best open source models in the world now come out of China. I mean, that's sort of this like awkward reality uh to contend with. And what do you think we can do to just make sure that it's the American models that are ahead, or you know, is that written in the stars, or you know, something tells me that's not the simplest explanation for me about why the Chinese models are so good is is espionage. I I think that there's um there's a lot of secrets in how these frontier models are trained. Um, and when I say secrets, they, you know, it sounds more interesting than they are, but there's just a lot of task and knowledge. There's a lot of, like, you know, tricks and small um and intuitions about where to set the hyperparameters and like, you know, ways to make these models um work and to get the model training to work. The Chinese labs have been have been able to move so quickly and accelerate and make such fast progress. Um, whereas some even like very talented U.S. labs, like, have made progress less quickly. And I just purely think it's because, you know, a lot of the the secrets about how to train these models, um, you know, those secrets leave the frontier labs and make their way back to these Chinese labs. Um, I I think the the only way to model the future is that China has pretty advanced models. Um, you know, the solace right now is they're not the best models. Um, they're sort of like a half step behind, let's say. Um, but, uh, but it's tough to model what'll happen when it's sort of truly neck and neck. We're very behind on energy production, which is just pure regulation, like that could be fixed in two seconds, but, you know, hasn't been yet. That's a huge problem. I mean, if you look at, you know, not that the past will be a predictor of the future. If you look at what U.S. total grid production looks like, it's like looks flat as a pig. And if you look at um, you know, Chinese uh aggregate uh, you know, grid production, it's like, you know, it's doubled over the past decade. It's just like it's just this like straight up. I saw that, and it's astonishing. It's I mean, that's just a policy failure. China just, you know, the vast majority of that is coal, and coal's growing in China, and um, in the United States, uh, actually renewables have grown a lot, but renewables trade off against the uh, the sort of fossil fuels. So we've sort of like done a done a transition of our of our um, energy grid, whereas they're just continuing to compound. Let's say we have this issue on power production, but we're we're advantage in chips. I think like net net, we will come out ahead on compute. Um, if you look at data, I mean, this goes towards a lot of the questions you've been you've been asking about, but like, I mean, I think China is like fundamentally very well positioned on data. Um, it's weird to say because obviously, like, you know, we help all the American companies with data in China, they can ignore copyright or other privacy rules, and and they can sort of um, you know, build these large models without abandon. And then and then the second issue is that um, there's actually large-scale government programs in China for data labeling. Um, there are uh, you know, seven data labeling centers um, like in various cities that have been started up by the government itself. There's large-scale subsidies for um, for AI companies to use data labeling, a voucher system. In fact, there's like college programs because, you know, one of the interesting things is in China, like employment is such a large national priority that they, like, you know, when they have a strategic area like AI, they'll like figure out, okay, what are all the jobs, and they'll like create these like funnels to um, to to create those jobs. And then we're seeing this in robotics data, too, where, like, there's the already in China, there are like large-scale factories full of robots that just go and collect data. Um, and uh, and strangely enough, like, even a lot of U.S. companies today actually rely on data from China in training these like robotics foundation models. Long story short, I think China likely has a data an advantage on data, and then the algorithms, um, you know, the U.S. is is on net much more innovative, but if espionage continues to be a reality, then like, you know, you're basically even on algorithms. So, um, so it's hard to model, but I think that probably like, you know, it's like 60, 40, 70, 30 that the United States, like, has like an undeniable continued advantage, but there's like a lot of worlds where China just like catches up or potentially even overtakes. I mean, the the scary thing for me is, you know, watching Optimus or YC has uh some robotics companies like Weave Robotics, and you know, we look at those things, the software can be as good or better than anything coming out of China, but when it comes to the hardware, it's like bomb cost over here, 20,000, 30,000 bucks, like you can't, you know, we can't even make like high-precision screws over here, and then over there, the same m, the same robot, the embodied robot could be made for like, I don't know, 2, 3,000, $4,000, right? It's like you just walk down a street in Shenzhen, and like they they got it, you know, and so how do you compete against that at sort of that at a state level? The degree to which China is incredible manufacturing, I mean, that's a that's a very big problem. Um, and it relates to defense and national security. It's a fundamental issue uh, because on some level defense and national security will boil down to which countries have more things that like can deter conflict or can can go into a, you know, can can shoot other things down. Yeah. I don't think it's going to be fighter jets and aircraft carriers anymore. I mean, it's probably going to be, you know, this micro war of it's like hyper micro. It's drones and embodied robots, and I mean, Yeah. Exactly. Drones, embodied robots. Cyber warfare. The um, Cold War era um, uh, philosophy of, like, you know, you build like bigger and bigger bombs. Um, it's like the exact opposite of that. It's actually like it's like the fragmentation and uh, and and move towards sort of like, you know, smaller, more nimble, attractable resources. Um, is the is the that that's like one of the big picture trends I would say. Um, and then the other big picture trend is just what we believe, which is uh, the move towards uh, agentic warfare or agentic defense, which is basically, you know, if you if you actually mapped out the what warfare looks like today or like what like the um, you know, the actual process of a conflict, um, you know, if you look at Russia, Ukraine or other conflict other conflict areas, like the decision-making processes are driven are remarkably manual and human driven. And it's just like all these all these like very critical battle time decisions are made, like, with very limited information, unfortunately, um, uh, in these like very manual workflows. And so it's very clear that that um, if you used AI agents, you would have perfect information, and you would have uh, immediate decision-m, and so that, you know, it's we're going to see this like huge shift towards um, agent-driven uh, warfare and agent-driven um, conflict, and it has the potential of turning these conflicts into these like almost incomprehensibly fastm moving uh, kinds of scenarios. And that's something that you guys are actively working on, right? Can you is there anything that you can talk about? I assume some of it is classified, but yeah. Yeah. So, one of the things we're doing is we we're building this uh, this system called Thunder Forge um, with uh, the Indopacific Command um, out in out in Hawaii. It's responsible for the sort of Indopacific region, and it is the flagship DoD program for um, using AI for military planning and and operations. So, we're basically doing exactly what I said. We are we take the h, the existing human workflow, the military works in a what's called a doctrinal way, or they're sort of like governed by the doctrine of this like, you know, very established military planning process, and you just convert that into, you know, a series of agents that work together um, and and conduct, you know, the exact same task, but it's just like all agent driven, and then all of a sudden you you turn these like um, very critical decision-making cycles from, you know, 72 hours to 10 minutes. And it kind of like changes it from um, you know, you know, when you play chess, if you play chess versus a human, they have to spend all this time thinking, um, you know, you you know, it's sort of this like slow game, and if you play chess against a computer, it's just like these immediate moves back, and it's like this sort of like unrelenting form of of warfare. I mean, some of it is like the being able to see the chain of thought immediately was is the most powerful thing. Yeah. Like, cuz is you know, I don't want the answer. I want to see how you got there. And then actually seeing the reasoning itself was so powerful. I mean, that's actually why the um, launch of that first Deepseek was way more interesting because uh, I think 01 had come out, but they hid the uh, the reasoning, and it's like, no, the reasoning is actually a really important part of it, and the only reason why they hid it was they didn't want other people to steal it, which they did anyway. I think that that's that's another like um, interesting thing about this space, which is that um, you know, so far you could really model as like there's like advanced capabilities um, and you can try to keep those secret, and you can try to keep those closed, but they open over time, kind of no matter what you do. Well, I mean, clearly, Alexandr, you've done a lot of incredible things and transformed your company multiple times, and you have all these deep matter expertise in many areas. You're clearly hardcore. Is there advice for the audience to be more like you? You know, I think that the the the biggest thing is um, you just have to really, really, really care. Um, and I think it's like a a folly of\n\n\nYouth in some ways that, um, that when you're young, like almost everything feels like, you know, so astronomically important that you just like, you try immensely hard and you care about every detail.\nYou know, everything, uh, matters just way more to you.\nAnd I think, um, and I think that that trait is really, really important, and, um, you know, it's like just in varying degrees for different people.\nSo I wrote this post many years ago called \"Hire people who give a [ __ ]\" and it really is pretty simple.\nYou notice, I noticed, you know, when you interview people or when you interact with people, you can tell people who are just sort of like phone it in versus people who sort of like, they like hang on to their work as like, you know, it's like it's like so incredibly monumental and forceful and important to them that they they do great work, and it sort of like eats at them when they don't do great work, and when they do great work, they're sort of so satisfied with themselves.\nAnd so there's sort of this like, um, the magnitude of of care.\nAnd one of the greatest indicators of like a just like how much I enjoyed working with people or like frankly how successful they were at Scale AI was really just this like what is what you know, to what degree of their what degree their soul is invested in into, um, uh, into the work that they do.\nAnd so I think that that, you know, if you were to pick one thing that that probably is the sort of like unifier in some way.\nIt's like, you know, um, I care a lot, uh, I care a lot about every decision we make at the company.\nUm, you know, I still review every hire at the company.\nYou know, I, I, we have this process why where I approve or reject literally every single hire at the company.\nUm, uh, and and so I care immensely, and then this and then like I work with all these people who care immensely, and then that enables us to really sort of like we, um, we feel much more deeply what happens in the business, and as a result we sort of like, uh, you know, we'll change course more quickly, we'll learn more quickly, um, we will, we'll take our work more seriously, we'll adapt more quickly, and I think that that's been quite important to the to the success that we've had.\nAlex, you were telling me a story recently that stuck with me about how like quite recently even, even when Scale AI was a very large company, you were personally hand reviewing all like the data that was being sent to partner companies and being like basically like the final quality control, like you know, like you know that data point is not good enough.\nYeah, exactly.\nI think a lot of founders would probably, um, would probably, uh, you know, agree with this, but, um, what your customers feel and when your customers are happy and sad, like it really like gets to you, and so when you have when you have unhappy customers, it's like it's like personally very painful thing.\nBroadly speaking, you know, we have this value at our company, um, quality is fractal, um, and and I do believe that like high standards sort of like, um, they trickle down within an organization, and, um, you know, it's very rare that you see an organization where like where like standards, um, increase as you get lower and lower down in the organization.\nYou know, most of the time when people realize their manager or their management manager or their like director or whomever don't really care, then they sort of like, you know, that that removes the sort of like the like deep desire to to need to care.\nUm, and so it's like incredibly important that that high standards, um, and and this sort of like this deep, um, uh, sort of care for quality is like this is this like, um, deeply embedded sort of, um, tenant of the entire organization.\nFounder mode, man.\nFounder mode, man.\nWe got to have you back.\nThank you so much for spending time with us.\nWith that, sorry we're out of time, but we'll see you next time.\n[Music]\nHeat.\nHey, heat.\nHey, heat.\n[Music]\n",
