  "cleanText": "I think the like dystopian view of AI or AI as like taking all our jobs and all of that is like not correct.\nAnd I think the Future of Work is more human, is more interactive, is more multimodal.\nOnce the making of things gets easier, the bottleneck goes back to to to like how many ideas you can have.\nI wouldn't put learning to code as the top thing.\nI would put learn to make things.\nLearn to make things with code.\nLearn to make things with video.\nLearn to make like anything with AI.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome back to The Breakdown.\nI'm Dave.\nThis is Tom.\nAnd today we're joined by Amjad Masad.\nAmjad is founder and CEO of Replit, which was a YC 2018 company.\nUh welcome to the show.\nThank you.\nSo today, uh we want to talk about kind of your beginnings in helping people learn to code, what you're doing now in replacing a lot of that work, and then where we see the future going in terms of how people make things.\nSo, Replit started um I guess in 2016, you were in YC in 2018.\nYou started out as a tool to make it really easy for people learning to program to set up development environments purely on the web.\nUm but now you're really taking off in AI assisted programming.\nTell us tell us the latest.\nYeah.\nSo, um the mission has always been to make programming more accessible.\nUh then we sort of uh you know after YC we sort of updated it to be a little more ambitious.\nWe started talking about a billion software developers and it just sounded absurd at the time and this is all Pre-LLM, right?\nYeah.\nPre-LLM.\nThere was a moment of time, I don't know if you remember that, but like 20 in the like 2015 AI hype.\nThere was like a bit of a NLP natural language hype as well.\nThere's a bunch of AI companies that ended up being just like humans behind the scene.\nThey all went broke, but um there was like a a glimpse of potentially doing NLP on code.\nSo, we had an idea that, you know, it's it's probably coming.\nI I even had it in my in my seed deck that like at some point like we'll collect enough data to like train models.\nIt wasn't until like GPT-2 in 2020 that I felt like it was was going to be possible.\nSo we you know we had we had built all these um primitives like the development environment, the sort of hosting environment, all the other stuff around it.\nUh and I felt like if if we just like added um like AI Agents, like it will be able to orchestrate all the stuff and it'll be it'll be really great.\nAgents were like every time we tried them.\nUh I think the first time we tried it like 2021 didn't work, 22 it didn't work, and then 2024 like early early in the in the year we just felt like it's getting close.\nEven GPT-4.0 could like be coherent for like um 2 minutes.\nSomehow just ended up doing a big bet.\nThe company was not doing super well.\nYeah.\nWas I was about to ask, was there like a bet the company moment where it's like we were teaching people to code, now we're no longer doing that, now we're going to enable everyone to build apps?\nYeah, yeah, yeah, we had grown the company quite a bit um and we were burning way too much money uh and we decided to do a layoff and so we we um cut like perhaps 50 people and then like another like 15, 20 people left and so we were like less than half of the company and so I just put everything on on Replit Agents.\nI just felt like this is the thing, it has to work.\nIt felt like it was close.\nYeah.\nI don't know.\nI was just like burn the boat boats kind of moments.\nIt's just like we got to do this.\nI mean, it's I felt like this was the this was the the thing that would make the company work.\nAnd honestly, like if Claude 3.5 hadn't come out mid us building agent, we would have probably failed.\nYeah.\nBecause um like I said, like GPT-4.0 would like stay coherent for 2, 3 minutes.\nClaude 3.5 was the first one that like could work for like you know five to 10 minutes and actually actually work and the code generations.\nAnd that's sort of the approach that I think is most successful for startups kind of building on the very edge of what is possible, you know, you start out on a mission, it's the techn is not quite there yet, you start building and you sort of you you skate where the puck is going, you know, it sort of catches up with you.\nYeah, and you you want to keep keep doing that.\nTotally.\nYeah, I remember you came to speak at YC like 6 months ago and right after you had launched this and at the time you said we're very far from fully automated software development.\nDo you still feel that way?\nNo, not at all.\nI mean, I I feel like I've, you know, every time I make a sort of some kind of prediction, it feels like bold and like, you know, but I've been I've been consistently wrong and like uh the way things are moving uh is a lot faster.\nJust the level of autonomy.\nUh like I said, like maybe 3.5 was like 5 to 10 minutes.\nLike 3.7 perhaps can get up to like four, five minutes to an hour.\nThe uh 4.0 No, in the in the system card and Opus, they said they made it work for seven hours.\nWow.\n7 hours.\nThat's incredible.\nThat's always been the limiting factor for making agents is like, can they stay coherent?\nCan is the context length actually useful to reason over.\nIf an LLM can work for for seven hours, that's basically like a human worker.\nYeah.\nAnd presumably they're working at much faster speed than a human would do.\nSo they're kind of completing perhaps a week's work in those seven hours.\nThe only thing that I think is is missing and a big limiting factor for actually automating a lot of work is computer use.\nComputer use kind of sucks.\nYou know, I'm sure you've you've tried it.\nAnd this is the difference between Replit Agent really uh giving it one prompt going all all the way in an app versus having to kind of babysit it a little bit and like test with it.\nAnd we had a company in the last batch called Browser Use that's um that's working browser automation.\nBrowser Use is great.\nAnd another one called Pig which is doing the same for kind of Windows desktops.\nAnd uh I think advice I would give founders today is um taking either Browser Use or Windows automation with Pig and trying to apply that into enterprise, into vertical into a vertical industry.\nThe moment this technology worked, those two companies are just going to totally and I think I think we're like weeks or perhaps single digit months away from it working really, really well and so now is the time to get started using those technologies.\nAbsolutely 100%.\nAnd this is this is what we're focused on.\nSo you know Replit Agent v1 to v2 was a huge jump in autonomy.\nUh v3 is the most autonomous thing.\nSo we're already working on it and um the interesting thing for us is the underlying technology and how it would enable autonomy.\nThere are like a few important things.\nOne is uh uh you know being transactional.\nThe ability to roll back is is very important.\nSo you you would want you'd want it to be safe for agents in the same way that gits made it safe for human programmers to kind of experiment and create branches, whatever you want the same thing for for agents like if an agent kind of messes up a DB migration it should be able to roll back and also it should be able to like sample uh across different different paths.\nUh I think this is very very important for autonomy.\nIf you look at uh like for example when when uh Anthropic publishes their Swedbench score, they publish one with that sampling and one with sampling and it goes from 70% to 80%.\nAnd so this is the idea that you sort of you spawn multiple agents, each one will take a a shot at it and then you figure out which one works and and choose that that branch effectively.\nWe built a infrastructure that is um uh fully transactional and moves in lock step meaning the file system is a snap snapshot fail based file system, the DB is a snapshot based uh u DB and so a as you're we're making commits uh to the entire system including the virtual machine as you're going uh and so what we can do is also we can we can fork it and branch it out.\nSo if if we had computer use that's working well, you can you can just like right now what they do with the sampling is they do they have some kind of judge that does ranking which you know it's not a true verifier, a true verifier is a is a is a test, right?\nAnd a computer use test.\nSo you you can sample out and really pick the best branch that's actually working.\nThat's incredible.\nAnd and repeat that on and on and reliability gets really, really high.\nSo fast forward six or 12 months, you're not spawning one agent, you're spawning is Is it five or 10 or a million?\nLike how\nI think this is where it's going to get interesting, which is you'd want to give the user the ability to set compute budgets.\nI I think we're starting to see that with um with the O style models of like here's here's how much budget.\nBut but look, I mean, if if you give us $1,000, we'll spend them if you know.\nSo, uh\nthat's really cool.\nI've not thought of that before.\nUm but the idea of like spawning multiple branches then just picking the best one and being able to do that in parallel.\nI just the human brain doesn't naturally work like that.\nWe think sequentially.\nWe can't.\nIt reminds me of this legend.\nI don't know if this is actually true, but at Apple when Steve was running it, he would intentionally have teams doing basically the same things and then see which one did the best job.\nIt's like I've heard OpenAI does that now.\nInteresting.\nUh I I've heard that like the Codeex project like had multiple different different teams.\nSo in the literature, you'll see that uh small small models sampled uh will beat larger models.\nSo Sonnet sampled is probably better than than Opus companies.\nUh haven't tried that where instead of hiring one senior engineer, you hire like 10 junior engineers and like give them the same task and then it's just very expensive with humans but with LM it's relatively cheap, you can just do that, do a hundred of them and just pick the best one every time.\nSo how are people using Replit Agent like and and who are the people using it?\nYou know it goes back to sort of our early vision that if you make programming easy uh then uh then more and more people would want to would want to do it.\nActually this is one of the first thing uh that that PG and I sort of connected on um before we got into YC actually PG um found us on HackerNews and so we started this email relationship um and so he he told me there's like a super linear relationship with how easy programming is versus how many people would want to do it.\nThe optimizing function of Replit has always been like just keep lowering the the barrier to entry and and that's how you grow users and you grow uh customers.\nRight now.\nUm, basically people from kind of every walk of life, we've seen users, product managers tend to be tend to be a very a great um use case and users for us and we've had customers uh product managers uh who uh are able to make significant impact on the business without talking to engineers at all, like you know running AB tests or optimizations or or things like that.\nI mean it's empowering.\nI mean it gets us to think about the really the seams between these roles like you know product manager, designer, engineer.\nWe actually just created a new new product group and and and typically you know product uh you know head of product is have has a bunch of like product managers reporting to them but we're actually having uh this this group have has designers, engineers and and PMs and the the idea is they're all using AI all the time to to prototype in some cases go all the way to production.\nThere isn't this sort of waterfall model where you know there's a lot of inefficiency, you know like communication problems between these different teams, they can move incredibly fast and I think that that starts to change how tech companies work.\nMy experience of this was when whenever I was working in a startup, the list of ideas and the backlog would always would be infinitely long basically and the bottleneck was always engineering time and now I'm doing my own personal projects, I write my to-do list or my idea list and then I get to work and my the ideas just get done and suddenly the bottleneck is like my ability to have ideas and it's just such a weird experience looking at a to-do list.\nIt's just empty being like what do I do next?\nI've heard from a team that has like a really large uh Replit deployment in their company that their founders using Replit and that's stressing the engineers out because oh I did this in a weekend like can't you do it in a\nwhat do you guys show for yourself and so are these previously technical people or non techchnical people they're building the first version, are they deploying that production or are they giving to engineers and say hey build this like what what do you see typically?\nWe advise to like work with with engineering, but that doesn't always happen.\nI think It's um understandable that a lot of PMs and designers want to go straight to users.\nWhat we're seeing is they go to like beta users and test users and I think this works really well, but in some cases they just like put it in production.\nUh and so right now we're having discussions with all these companies, especially the engineering leaders are unhappy about this like who's on call for these services, you who's responsible for the bug, who's responsible for it.\nThere's a lot of questions that are coming up.\nThe obvious answer to all these questions is like agents are responsible.\nSo what's the limiting factor today?\nI buy code a thing and I'm like yoloing it into production.\nLike what are what do the engineers typically object like?\nWhat what's going wrong?\nSecurity is is is a big one.\nLike um LLMs are fallible like like humans are.\nThey tend to write some uh there's some components that they do terribly at like for example off uh like they all kind of suck at it.\nAll use like you know old methods of of assaulting and hashing and so that's been that's been a big sticking point and we've seen a lot of examples out there right now of some catastrophes.\nLuckily it hasn't been like there hasn't been a major catastrophe.\nI think it's coming, but uh there's been uh like solo founders who would leak um you know API keys or would make it really easy to get around the login security protections and there are a lot of tools out there that are like really not trying to take responsibility for that and saying, \"Oh, it's it's the user's problem, the user's fault.\"\nFor us, we think that as a platform that is marketing uh for the non-developer, you actually have a responsibility.\nWe're trying to take away uh some of the things that we think LMS should not do today.\nUh so O for example, we have a built-in O.\nSo if\n\n\nYou go to wrap and just say add O, it will pull in an O component that we built from scratch. It has capture on it. It has all the security, you know, bells and whistles, so you don't have to worry about all of that.\n\nWe integrated with your database. You have a user management portal on your site as much as possible, building in these components that are tricky. I think payments is the other one. I don't think you'd want the LLMs to kind of do the payments.\n\nAnd they're not that different, right? Like the sort of checkout. You know, you might have a one-time checkout, you might have subscription, pay as you go, but there are not unlimited versions of payments. There's like two or three or four.\n\nAnd this is the analogy: today, humans don't write their own version of payments or their own version of O. They use providers that have built these components already. So, seems like we're seeing the same thing play out, and that's the best way to do it.\n\nYeah, 100%. And then the other thing we added, uh, we partnered with is a great security company called Samrip. And so right now, uh, when you go to deploy a Replit app, we run a security scan. We run a code security scan, and we give you like a report of warnings and errors and things like that, and the agents can try to fix them for you.\n\nOkay. And so security is one of the big kind of bottlenecks to fully deploying to production. I can imagine there must be other things that are coming down the line, like sort of scalability, you know, looking for like N+1 database queries, uh, performance bottlenecks. What do you have in your mind, like a clear set of blockers that need to be overcome before this is truly like one click to deploy?\n\nYeah, I, I mean, the big, the biggest one is just going to be humans, like social, like, you know, there's just going to be mistrust, and I think it's just going to have, has, has to play out. So, you know, leaving that aside, like enterprises have to adapt to all of that stuff, having some way to also scan for scalability, like figuring out, you know, uh, like doing fuzzing or whatever it is, or having some kind of adversarial agent that's, you know, trying to break your app. I think, um, you know, that's one big thing. I think integrating with a company's ecosystem. So, one thing we're adding is the ability to bring in your design system.\n\nThat's cool.\n\nSo, in addition to kind of us providing these components, if you go to any company, they have a lot of these components built out. As Replit is getting deployed into these large companies, how can we hook into their internal systems?\n\nThis makes me think about the kind of spectrum of these different coding tools. Um, on one end of the spectrum, you have kind of what I would call the power tools, the Cursors, the Wind Surfs that let developers use this as a way to amplify their efforts. And on the full other end of the spectrum, you have more of the like consumer-facing, hey, if you want to make an app, like you can now make an app. And it sounds like you guys are kind of in the middle. Um, you're helping companies get stuff done, but you're doing it for people who don't look like the traditional developer. How do you see this world playing out? Are there going to be like N different tools, or will we converge to one place on that spectrum?\n\nAGI is convergence, obviously, but, but leaving that aside, it's really hard to plan for that world. I think that the battle for how to incrementally make product engineers more productive is just, it's an obvious one. The market there is obvious. There's a lot of companies going after it. Both the application companies like Cursor, the underlying model companies are trying to go there. I mean, um, you know, Claude code is competing with Cursor. Cursor uses a cloud. I think it's a bit of a bloodbath there, but it's the market is obvious, and the market is really large. I would guess that there's going to be more of a consolidation there.\n\nMaybe it's not, you know, one, but it's probably two or three, uh, at best. I think the sort of the market we're in is a lot larger. Uh, so the addressable humans is a lot more. You know, we're talking about a billion, but it could be more. Like, really, any knowledge worker should be able to like solve problems with software. My conception of Replit right now is the what we want it to be is a universal problem solver. It'll solve problems in your personal lives or, you know, solve problems in, uh, in your work and, and all of that. And so I think that that market is, uh, will probably be like a little more diverse, and I think companies will kind of figure out where, um, where they slot in, trying to solve, uh, autonomous programming with the focus on the non-engineer.\n\nUh, we want you to not worry about security, not worry about systems, not worry about any of that. We want you to really come in with your ideas to Replit and be an agents manager. And we're trying to do it in a way that is like as human as possible and kind of fits into the workflow. One big difference between engineers and sort of non-engineers, be it executives or product managers, you're not on your desk like eight hours a day. Mobile is a big part of that. We have like a really great mobile app. And we're thinking about this way of like ambient building. Maybe you start an app on your, uh, in your desktop. You go away with your phone. You're in a boring meeting. You get a notification from the agent saying, \"I'm done with this. Do you want something else?\" You got texted. And so we're trying to kind of build that thing.\n\nYeah. A question I had, um, related to that point is about the user interface. So, for something like Cursor or Wind Surf, it's pretty obvious. The primary UI element is like the code. You see code, you have a little chat window, but primarily it's about diffs. It's about kind of changes to code. And for a tool like Replit, the primary interface is like the graphical user interface. You know, it's the, it's the buttons and the wizzywig, like you see what you're building.\n\nExactly. And that's great for building user interfaces, but when you're trying to build more complicated sort of logical flows, I found it a little bit difficult because I couldn't, there's no way I couldn't see the code. I can't visualize what's going on behind the scenes. And it's sort of, it's almost a black box. Fast forwarding here, if you're trying to build more complex internal workflows, how do they, how does a product manager or an operations manager at a big company visualize that workflow and the kind of logical branching that happens?\n\nYeah. So, if you look back in the history of computing, there was always this vision of visual programming. It never worked, uh, very well because ultimately it's about Turing completeness, like these systems are not universal computing devices. And now we go to codegen. Obviously, codegen is Turing complete. Um, but you're interfacing with it primarily via natural language. Natural language is fuzzy. It's really hard to know whether it's doing the right thing. I think the synthesis of these two things is probably coming where you are interfacing with natural language, but you can, instead of like just staring at code, uh, there's maybe an interface or like a different view on top of code. You can imagine being able to do, you know, small talk.\n\nYeah. So, small talk is this, uh, it's the first object-oriented, um, uh, programming, um, system, and, you know, Alan Kay would say it's like, it is actually OP, where everything comes after it is not. Um, but the interesting thing about it, in small talk, you can actually, the way you interact with code is not via files, but via objects, via like logical objects. And so there's some kind of prior arc there, and I think the world we're headed in where there's some kind of abstraction over code that allows people to like understand it.\n\nYeah, I think that's really interesting. I, there's some, there's like an open space there, whether it's like pseudo code is like looks like English, but it's a little bit more structured, or it's a visual drag and drop. I don't know. It's\n\nYeah, I think back to building products with a team of engineers, designers, and other folks. The interactions that I would have as the like product lead with those teams was verbal. It would be written, like abstracted ideas. We would draw stuff on the whiteboard together. We'd make system diagrams. We'd look at the results of the app, and we would test it and point out, like, \"Oh, this thing is broken. That's too slow.\" And it feels to me like that sort of interface, which is very multimodal and very flexible, is probably the best end result. Like, I think we will get to something like that where the author of products will be doing that, but the teams they're talking to are not other humans, they're agents doing these things. Has, has there been an attempt in, in sort of PM land to have a little more formalism around communication or\n\nYes. And I would not say it's been good. The main thing is just like the PRD, right? The product spec, right? And it's just become, in my opinion, uh, oftentimes a performative work artifact that you create just so that you can have a thing to get your promotion, right? If you're at a big company. Uh, but they're not actually that useful. To me, the most useful interactions are just these like whiteboard conversations, right? What do we want it to do here? Oh, we got to think about that. Oh, we didn't consider this. Okay, let's rethink this whole thing. Like those sorts of conversations.\n\nAI can play a role in that as well. So, I, um, you know, this startup, Granola, uh, that allows you to kind of record meetings, and they released this like team version that like all the meetings, uh, gets transcribed and and go there, and they have a mobile app right now where like you can put on the table and like it's trying. So, I, I was thinking maybe we should go Granola maximalism, where, look, you shouldn't fight the trend in which companies are becoming increasingly oral as opposed to like written, um, and because like, you know, people are talking on Slack, people are in meetings, people like are communicating via prompts with agents, uh, but you, you would want a set of AI tools that is actually like creating that, that, that record and in background that's like searchable and organizable and and all of that.\n\nYeah. I wonder when we'll have our first AI in like oral meetings. You know, you're jamming with your designer, and you, the AI, like chips in and says, \"Well, how about this idea?\"\n\nYeah. And, and this is where I think the like dystopian view of AI or AI as like taking all our jobs and all that is like not correct. And I think the future of work is more human, is more interactive, is more multimodal, is more fun, in my opinion.\n\nYC's next batch is now taking applications. Got a startup in you? Apply at ycombinator.com/apply. It's never too early, and filling out the app will level up your idea. Okay, back to the video. All right, so, so last time we chatted, uh, you had launched Replit agent, and things were growing really crazy. I imagine that has continued. Any, anything you can share there? Maybe soon we'll, we'll share some numbers, but, uh, since Replit agent launch, we're growing 45% compound monthly, uh, average.\n\nThese are like metrics that we tell YC companies during the batch when they have a base of like no users to try to achieve, and you're doing this at a larger scale.\n\nYes. But, you know, it put a lot of strain, strain on the company, and our systems were still relatively, relatively small. I, I feel like it can get to your head, and you can start optimizing for the wrong thing. It's very easy in AI to increase ARR while users are not happy because they're spending a lot more and like not getting the results, and in some cases, maybe shouldn't grow that that fast because like you'd want users to get a better experience for less, less money. And so it's one thing that we try not to obsess. We actually don't have ARR goals at Replit. We have like more product goals, retention goals, just like other methods.\n\nYeah, because the sort of bad pattern with some AI companies, you grow topline revenue very, very quickly, the churn is like approaching 100%, and eventually that just catches up.\n\nAnd the gross margins are horrible, too. And so it's like,\n\nyou know, the more growth you have, the worse the company's doing financially. And so,\n\nso how do investors see this space? You, you must have talked with a bunch. Can they tell the difference?\n\nIt's all kind of a blur for them because investors, when they, I mean, I'm just going to generalize here, but when they start looking at the space, they'll use everything for three minutes, and everything for three minutes looks the same. So, I, I think, I think it will, it will start to clarify, and these products will start to, uh, I suppose, to converge, diverge more with the different focuses in the areas we're talking about. I think over the next year, it'll be like a little more clearer, but I think a lot of them are, are just like, you know, super, when we talk to them, they're super confused. They don't understand these systems. They don't understand where they're going.\n\nI think that's a great segue into, um, the, the sort of technology underlying some of these tools. I'd love to dig in a little bit deeper. We've, we've seen some announcements from Cursor and Wind Surf about how they're kind of layering, whether it's, um, Claude or Gemini or, um, the OpenAI models with then their own layers on top, the fast apply APIs, stuff like that, fast apply models, I guess. Can you give us an overview of how it works at Replit?\n\nYeah, a lot of it is you're patching problems with the underlying frontier models. Yeah.\n\nSo, the reason fast supply was important because none of the models, uh, were doing very well at diffs. Can you explain what, what supply is?\n\nWhen you're trying to like edit a file as an LLM, the best thing to do is to like, uh, create a, create a diff. Uh, but these models are actually not very good at creating diffs. They're actually not very good at countering the lines in the source code. So, they get confused about a lot of these things. So, for a while, a lot of companies were just like rewriting the entire, entire file.\n\nAnd so, diff for, for nontechnical users is sort of like remove these three lines and inject these other three lines instead, like find and replace almost.\n\nThat's right. That's right. And so you needed some way to, um, make the model generate some something of a diff, but it's actually not good enough to merge it. And so you need another model to actually do the merge. So, instead of rewriting, like it's a thousand-line file, just like output the entire thousand lines,\n\nit's very slow. It's very expensive. So,\n\n\nYou prompt the model to be as lazy as possible.\nBut in that case, it's really hard to apply. Okay, so you need another model that's like doing the application. Okay, you can train a model or you can use Gemini Flash or some of these smaller models. And so in some cases you need to train a model or fine-tune a model to do a better job at it. In other cases, you just also patch a bunch of other models to do it. It's engineering. It's engineering as opposed to like research, I would say.\nAnd I noticed, um, you guys don't expose the underlying model to the user with other tools like Cursor and Wind Surf. There's a drop down. It's like, I want to, you know, let's see what Gemini thinks of this problem. You don't do that. Why is that?\nA big part of our research efforts is in eval, and I think this is like an underrated part of like, you know, co-AI coding. So we spend a ton of time evaling new models, writing evals, generating evals, just data crunching, trying to figure out what the users are getting or are feeling. We built a lot of systems to try to understand, um, how these systems are performing. The moment a new frontier model lands, we are evaluating almost immediately. Jim and I, for example, like, uh, you know, a couple months ago, were making the rounds, really great model, really awesome at like oneshotting, in some cases better than Claude, agentic work wasn't at like a tool calling at, you know, some of the things like that, but users just see the hype and they're like, oh, like, yeah, give me Gemini. That's how much notice do you have? Do they like drop it on you and you like scrambling, or do you have like days or weeks before that to try to, you know, test it out?\nWell, we have good partnerships with these companies. We have a great partnership with Google. We have a great partnership with, uh, with Anthropic, even with OpenAI. We have a close relationship. So, a lot of them give us, give us a heads up, give us some early checkpoints, and we, we try, we, we kind of play with all of them. And in the case of Anthropic, we're always like the first day kind of launching because we end up building. A lot of times we're sort of anticipating where they're going.\nYeah.\nBecause you kind of like, you can tell, like 3.5, 3.7, there, there's some direction, you can tell like where 4.0 is going to land. So you start architecting the systems, but you know, ultimately a lot of our engineering efforts still infrastructure, like the the distributed network file system, that snapshot based network file system, like it took us two years to build. Like there's nothing off the shelf to do that. A lot of the security stuff is really, really difficult. Like Replit is one of the few places in the world where you can get like a virtual machine in the cloud, um, you know, by just like creating an account, and that's like a, it's really hard to kind of run this and protect against this. You have crypto miners, you have all sorts of stuff like that.\nAnd Replit also uses, um, uh, Nix OS under the hood. NixOS is a like fully declarative, also transactional, uh, operating system generator, as it were. Uh, we have like this multi-terabyte, uh, hard drive in all the different regions that we have compute, um, that that that cached all the packages in the in the world, and that gets attached to every container. And, and again, all of that, I mean, I keep coming back to this idea of transactionality, like you would want the system to be fully functional. You would want it to be, um, you would want it to be safe in order to like experiment with something, go back, do the sampling with with agents. So really a lot of the, a lot of the work is just like the engineering of this infrastructure, and it's like not as a parent, not as sexy as sort of like, we're trained this model, here's the, um, but but I think this is where you can build like a, uh, a bit of a lead.\nYeah. I, when VCs talk about moats, uh, the thing that I translate it to in my head is what is the compounding advantage that you might be able to achieve.\nRight. It's not really a defensive mode. It's more just I'm ahead, and by being ahead in some vector, it allows me to continue to move faster. That's right.\nAnd it sounds like this is a great example of that.\nTrue modes are often not obvious until like decades, perhaps many decades into into the company. Like you wouldn't know what like Netflix's mode. Uh, but obviously they have one. Like Disney tried to like compete with them, and everyone was like, you know, down on on on Netflix, but turned out they have a mode that is this, uh, content production system that they that they built.\nSo, Amjad, you started with the mission of like making it easier for people to learn to code. You've accomplished a lot of that. Now you're pushing the envelope of what it even means to code. I've got young kids. I want them to be productive creators in the world. What should I tell them to do? Should they learn to code? What does that even mean?\nLook, I think if you want to go the like professional software developer route, I think getting a computer science degree and like learning fundamentals makes sense. But if you want to be a creator, if you want to be a generalist in this world, I don't think it's necessary anymore to learn to code in the more like traditional ways of learning to code. I think you pick it up by osmosis, almost like, like go, go, go to Replit and you know, and start using it, and at some point you're going, going to run into some issue where you're going to have to look at code or you're going to have to look at logs, just by being resourceful, having to Google around and all that. You'll start picking it up.\nAnd by the way, this is how our generation kind of learned how to code, right? When you were talking, I'm like, that's what I did.\nYeah. And somehow, uh, it just became very industrial and very formal over the years, like the way we made web apps is like you just like start a notepad with a, you know, HTML file, and now you have to like learn like webpack or whatever, you know, it's like so, um, I think the future of work is not really clear what is, you know, we can sort of like have some like, you know, idea of like where where the world is headed, and so with with my children, I want them to have like as broad, uh, based knowledge as possible. Uh, I want them to be as generalist as possible. I want them to be as generative as possible, like being able to like create a lot of ideas, because once the making of things gets easier, the bottleneck goes back to to to like how many ideas you can have.\nUm, and so I, I, I wouldn't put learning to code as the top thing. I would put learn to make things. Learn to make things with code. Learn to make things with video. Learn to make like anything with AI.\nAnd so what do you think happens with SaaS generally if we're very soon able to say create me a version of Google Calendar or clone DocuSign? What happens to SaaS? Do you think?\nWe have stories today of, um, a lot of people replacing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of SaaS, um, with Replit.\nThe other day I heard a story from someone who, um, you know, they got quoted $150,000 for a piece of software. He went and made it in Replit, sold it to his employer for $32,000, cost him $400. Companies that have a platform developer community around it and and plug-in ecosystem and things like that, I think those are safe.\nYou're not going to be able to vibe code Salesforce. I think the the vertical SaaS is is in trouble, and I think it's my guess it's already probably showing in some of the metrics.\nOkay, last question. What advice would you give to, um, founders starting out right now?\nYou know, the best advice is what we, what you, what you actually pointed out earlier, is work on the edge of what's possible.\nUh, because, uh, one evolution of of AI or models will make your business valuable, and suddenly you're first on market. I find it rare to see founders that are actually like sitting down trying to actually predict the future, and and and maybe that's something that was, you know, ill advised in the past, but I think right now trying to actually figure out where things are headed is very, very important, uh, skill to have. So like, make some prediction, uh, figure out like how to create like a crappy product that would get better immediately as you switch switch the model. I mean, Computer use is a is is a great example.\nOh, it's been an absolute pleasure. Thank you so much for coming on.\nPleasure. Thank you.\nSee you next time. Thanks.\n[Music]\n",
