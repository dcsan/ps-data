  "cleanText": "YC's next batch is now taking applications. Got a startup in you? Apply at https://ycombinator.com/apply. It's never too early, and filling out the app will level up your idea. Now, on to the video.\n\nYou have to innovate. You have to move faster than everybody else. And it's like running a marathon but at an extremely high velocity, right? The only mode you have is speed. I read all the Twitter comments every time. Google IO last year was AI overview and Perplexity is dead. This year was AI mode and Perplexity is dead, and I read all of that too, and it's it's always fun. I love it, actually.\n\n[Music]\n\nAravind Srinivas, I see you every, I don't know, two or three months, and you give me an update on the latest on Perplexity. Why don't you just tell these folks where you're at? How are things going? Do people use Perplexity? Do you guys use Perplexity?\n\nWell, whether you believe it or not, like I have infra issues every day. So there are a lot of people using it, and um, this usage is actually growing to the extent that we don't actually know how to deal with it. We have to rebuild the infra to scale the next 10x. So definitely a lot of people in the world using it. Thanks to all of you as well.\n\nWhat is next for us? The browser. That's the big bet we're making as far as the future of the company goes.\n\nEveryone here is like, why should I use Perplexity when there's search and other AI apps? Of course, ChatGPT has a bigger distribution than us. Every other AI app is trying to put search as a layer in it. All of them support citations. A lot of them support some of the verticals we put work into. Yes, like we're always going to continue to remain better than others in that category, but I think the browser and agents are truly the next bet that we want to make. We think about it as an assistant rather than a complete autonomous agent, but one omni box where you can navigate, you can ask formational queries, and you can give agentic tasks, and your AI with you on your new tab page, on your site, as an assistant on any web page you are, makes the browser feel like more like a cognitive operating system rather than just yet another browser. And we hope to make it like a cloud where you launch several tasks in parallel that are running asynchronously. Okay. And pulling all your personal contacts, your email, your calendar, your Amazon, your, you know, all all sorts of social media accounts that you have, and you go and do research on real estate, the markets, and these are all like just processes running on your browser. That's never been possible before. And Chrome was exciting when each tab was its own process. You think about each query or each prompt could be that, and that will be our new browser comet. So, we're putting all our energy into that.\n\nThis was going to be the hard question I saved for the end, but since you queued it up, I'll do it right now. Um, I think if Sam Altman were still on the stage today, he would say, \"Oh, yeah, that's what we're doing.\" Um, and I think Sundar at Google probably would say that's the direction we're headed as well. So, it feels like there are a bunch of players now, many of them very well-funded, going in generally the same direction. How do you see the world? Like, do you think that there's going to, it's going to play out where there's actually like a bunch of different use cases and you can own a very important one that others won't want to own, or are we in for like a major competitive battle?\n\nLook, if something is really worth doing, it's it's only natural that people with a lot of funding will go and do it. Um, people said Perplexity is a great product. Now everyone is trying to do something that can answer any question with sources. Cursor was a great product. Now, OpenAI is trying to buy Cursor's competitor, Anthropic, launch codeex, uh, like Clot Code. Google has its own like rival tool. So, it's only natural that when there's a lot of money to be made in a certain sector, people are going to try to copy it. And there's only a limited amount of things you can be world class at, whether it's being building great models or building one or two really good products. So, you're obviously not going to win on everything. For us, this is the only thing we care about: accuracy at the level of answers, accuracy at the level of tasks, orchestrating all these different tools. The browser is much harder to copy than like, uh, yet another chat tool. That said, I'm I'm fully working with the assumption that, uh, OpenAI will also build its own browser. Anthropic will also try to build its own browser. Google already has one called Chrome. So, it's completely reasonable to expect them to do it. And the only mode you have is speed. You have to innovate. You have to move faster than everybody else. And it's like running a marathon but at an extremely high velocity, right?\n\nYes. Yeah. I I really agree with your statement that like you can only focus on one thing and be world class at one thing. And just to give you guys like a little glimpse into it, we were backstage before this talk, and he was showing me some of the new stuff that they're working on, and there was like a bug, right? And he stopped everything he was doing to like figure out what was wrong with this bug. Why was it not doing the right thing? And if you think about like what would the CEO of a large company do in that situation? Probably they would like hand it off to somebody else on their team. So that's like a good piece of evidence that you actually mean what you say.\n\nYeah. I I I love I love triaging and fixing bugs. I know it sounds trivial. Like, is that the best use of the time of a CEO? There are a lot of people who would think otherwise. Recently people are like, uh, oh, like, like there, I hope this behavior is rubbing off on others. Like I've noticed even Sundar is doing bug support on X right now. So I'm happy that like, you know, that that's setting a good example.\n\nGreat. Okay, let's go back to the beginning. Like most of the folks in the audience here are either students or recent grads or grad students. Um, and I think hearing your story of like how you started Perplexity, uh, would be really interesting to them because it's probably exactly the world that they're in now.\n\nYeah.\n\nTell us how you got started. We started the company without actually having a clear idea of what to build, which is the opposite of what YC advises, which is start from a project and turn it into a company. I really think at this point in time when AI is improving so fast, you don't have to rigidly stick to any one idea when you're getting started, but the most important thing is you don't change the idea every week, like that you shouldn't do either. So start with something like brainstorm, think about it, and then try to immediately build it and get it in the hands of people. Uh, one tool that we were building was natural language SQL, which we actually thought about it as a search tool searching over relational databases. I allowed Twitter search, but it never like, like the original version of Facebook graph search. I allowed that when I was much younger. So I wanted to like rebuild that but using language models. Um, and I love Twitter as a platform. So, it was there's no good way to search over Twitter. There still is no good way to search over Twitter. But at least at the time, we organized the entire Twitter's data in the form of like relational tables and just converted every user's query into a SQL query and ran it as against the database, and it was really, really good, and um, that's what got us started. But at some point, we figured it's better to like scale this across the web, and we cannot make every website in the form of tables, and neither is it actually easy to answer all sorts of questions. So we bet on the fact that language models can do all the reasoning and parsing and like structuring later, but the more important thing is to start with something more unstructured, and that ended up becoming Perplexity.\n\nGot it. Um, and maybe one step before you actually left to go start the company, like how did you find your co-founders? How did you decide that machine learning and AI was like the area you wanted to focus on?\n\nCuz that was the only thing I was good at. I was not good at anything else.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo, what's the point in starting a company? I cannot start a delivery company or a social media company. Like, I'm not I'm not the right fit, right? Uh, the only thing I knew was AI and machine learning. In fact, it's funny. I we started an AI company, uh, but we're not made fun of, like, not even training our own models, like, mo, but only the foundation models are stuff we don't train. We train so many different models, but uh, that's the extent to which you need to have the intellectual humility to know like what you're good at, what is actually doable for you within with the resources that you have access to. And the co-founders are like people I like, like I knew from grad school, so we had been talking and discussing ideas for a long time, and um, I think grad school is a great way to like, uh, you know, like, like identify your co-founders. You don't talk to them with the you know, with the long-term calculation of like, oh, this could be my co-founder of my future company. You talk to them because they're interesting people. And I think that's essentially the value of the Y Combinator network. So even if your first startup year fails, you get access to a lot of amazing people, and maybe they could be your future co-founders. So that that's essentially what grad school was for me.\n\nYeah, that's awesome. Um, okay. So, you launched this first version of Perplexity, which is largely to like do Twitter search effectively. Um, at what point did it like start to work and you maybe internally felt like, oh, we should keep working on this. This is going to be something to explore.\n\nYeah. So, whoever we gave early access to, they were all very excited about it. They kept using it repeatedly. I think there's a phenomenon in products where there's an initial wow factor. Yep. And then mostly either drops completely, that that means you never had real retention, or it it definitely drops, but there's sustained usage. So when we saw that for the relational database searches like Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, we knew that we have like there was something magical about combining large language models in search. But then what we did is like we dreamt bigger and said what if we just give answers and cite the relevant sources. We launched that as a Discord bot, and that was also continually being used. It was not like a one-day usage and people started ignoring it. So that's when we decided we had the courage to launch it. We launched it seven days after the ChatGPT launch, especially at a time when ChatGPT did not have web right web search. So that was a good moment. And I think like many of the successful AI products that people speak about today, Cursor included, all were like 2022 launches or like, like early 2023 or late 2022 launches. So they're all like old people, you know, in the in the in the in this AI time scale.\n\nYes.\n\nFor me, the aha moment was like the New Year's Eve, there was like close to 700,000 queries. And I was like, okay, this has the crappiest name for a consumer product. It's called Perplexity. Very hard. Nobody even knows how to share it. And then it was so slow. Took seven seconds to answer for a query at the time. And um, it was making a lot of mistakes, hallucinations, and like a no-name company, no-name founder, very one or two million dollars in seed funding. Despite that, people were caring enough to sharing screenshots and like and and a New Year's Eve, and you could be, you know, watching Netflix, right? So, uh, that's when I knew there was something real here, and I started like optimizing for like, you know, committing to this this vision.\n\nOkay. And at that point, like on that New Year's Eve, did you in your head think I'm building a thing that could really compete with Google and like take over a market as big as what Google offers, or was it just a toy for you?\n\nThe first time the thought occurred to me was when um, Google wrote a blog post. Sundar wrote a blog post about Bard. Like that was around the time when we were raising series A funding, and everybody said, \"Okay, Bard is going to do whatever you're doing.\" And it's like, why do I have to build Bard? Like, why not just do it on Google, right, where you you have all the distribution in the world? So why do you have to build a separate product? Like, just just update your core main, the best possible asset to do this exactly. And I kept thinking it was pretty obvious you cannot like, if if if people can get answers to best hotels to stay in San Francisco with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge or like Bay Bridge, or like where can I stay in New York, like next to the Central Park with good amenities, or like which flight is the best thing for me to take to fly from SF to London. If you get direct answers to these questions with booking links right there, how are you going to mint money from booking and Expedia and Kayak and like, like, you know, or like same same thing for shopping. How are you going to take money from um, Amazon and like Walmart for the same ad where they're all bidding against each other? It's not in their incentive to give you good answers at all. So that's when I realized that they have to build a separate product, but they can never capitalize on their core distribution. And 2024, 2023 especially, and a large part of 2024 too, Google had like maybe the fourth or fifth best models at any moment. So as a startup outside Google, you had access to AI that was better than what Google internally had, which was unprecedented, right? Until then, if you had to compete with Google and you had to build something that needed a lot of AI in it, good luck, right? Like, cuz you never have an AI outside Google that's even equal, leave alone being better. But now it's a completely reversal of the situation thanks to OpenAI or Anthropic or open source models. So that plus innovator dilemma plus the fact that we could make a lot of mistakes and it's fine. Whereas for Google, one mistake tanks their stock. Like you remember the live demo of Bard where it failed and the stock went down 6%.\n\nYep.\n\nSo we knew that there was a lot of advantages for us.\n\nYeah. And I heard you talk about this recently, but you know, Google specifically has been trying to build Perplexity-like experiences, and you know, you, AI mode.\n\nYeah. They just like change the name of it each Google IO and then not really true. I'm not I'm\n\n\nNot, I'm not like saying something wrong.\nYes.\nRight.\nSo, it's like I, I look, it might sound a little, um, cocky to say that, but it's true.\nUm, the same feature is being launched year after year after year with a different name, with a different VP, with a different group of people, but it's the same thing, except maybe it's getting better, but it's never getting launched to everybody.\nOne of the things I, I've come to admire about you is you really have a focus on the user experience, and, and you told me how you kind of learned that from Larry Page.\nYeah.\nBy reading the book about, uh, Google.\nUm, why do you think Google has lost that ability?\nWell, it's a much bigger business, right?\nAnd it's not founder anymore.\nUh, it's hard to take risks.\nUm, I think they have great people.\nNobody, like, no one in this audience would think Google has incompetent people.\nI think they're like really great engineers.\nIt's largely the incentive structure.\nIt's hard to, like, you know, take a hit on your own stock and do the thing that's long-term correct.\nSo, you know, honestly, I'm happy that that sort of dilemma exists because otherwise, where is the opening for startups, right?\nAnd, and then if startups can succeed, then it's going to be monopolies getting bigger and bigger, and that's not great for the world.\nI actually am very happy that we are able to win, and they're also like able to, like, ship new products, and people are like, first time comparing, right?\nEarlier, for access to information, you would never even bother to compare an alternative to Google.\nIt's true.\nLike, that was like considered a waste of time, a joke.\nNow, at least you're like, oh, I first go ask this app, like, I, I'll ask Google, or I'll ask Chad GPT, or I'll ask Perplexity, or ask Gemini, and then maybe you don't even ask Google anymore.\nYou just ask the AI apps, and there are a bunch of AI assistants, and the phone makers will start offering all of them as alternatives.\nIt's not going to be like a locked-in default search option.\nSo, I'm really happy that they're competing in a world where a monopoly hopefully doesn't exist, and that creates a more fair ground for everybody.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYou were also telling me backstage about, um, you know, you are facing this increased competition from a variety of folks, but if you look at your numbers, you haven't really seen effect.\nYou know, I read all the Twitter comments every time the Google IO, exactly the same set of comments repeated this year.\nUh, Google IO last year was AI overview, and Perplexity is dead.\nThis year was AI mode, and Perplexity is dead, and I read all of that too, and it's, it's always fun.\nI love it, actually, um, because like, like, they know that they're all thinking, like, I don't, I don't even expect these things, or the people in the company are like thinking Google wouldn't build this or something like that, but it's the reality is, like, nobody actually gets exposed to those features, but competition is real.\nOkay, let's assume, let's, let's accept that OpenAI is extremely well-funded, doesn't have all these innovative DMA problems, wants to actually ship search on ChatGPT.\nChatGPT is the most successful consumer AI product out there.\nAnd so, competing against it is very difficult, which is why I, I really want to, like, um, push the company more on the browser side, and I think Comet, the browser, will be an abstraction layer above chatbots.\nI, you could even imagine, like, I, you know, if you permit Comet, all your ChatGPT chats can, you know, be fed into that AI, and like, you don't even have to worry about memory or personalization or, like, you know, any of these things, and it'll do a thing, a lot of new things that a chatbot cannot do, like accessing other tabs, accessing your browsing history, going and completing forms for you, like paying your credit cards, buying stuff for you, um, and being your scout, you know, going and doing all the research for to that sort of thing, like periodic recurring tasks.\nI think that's the magic that the browser enables for you.\nAnd putting it into, like, mobile, like, like building mobile versions of this browser is going to be very hard, like, just engineering-wise, it's going to take many months.\nSo, I'm not really worried about, like, someone else trying to copy this.\nIt's going to take time for anybody.\nSwitching to a different browser is like a pretty big decision for a user.\nWhat, what do you think will be the very short-term things that your browser will do so much better than what I can get today in Chrome that will make me want to switch?\nThe perfect blend of AI, navigation, and agents is, is, is what we're going to offer.\nAnd, um, might sound like a boring answer, but no one's done that.\nAnd there are, like, hundreds of millions, probably close to a billion people using AI these days.\nSo, the market's already pretty big.\nWhat's like a specific example of how I would do that, you know, if I had access to it tomorrow?\nYou can schedule your meetings.\nUh, you can reply to some of your emails that you don't even want to read.\nYou can, like, for example, let's say you're hosting a Y Combinator event, and you say, I only want to accept Stanford dropouts, and it can go through the entire list of people who applied and just filter based on who's, you know, took, scrape their LinkedIn URLs, filter based on whether they were Stanford and whether they dropped out or not, and then accepted, like that level of multi-step reasoning is something you can uniquely do.\nBy the way, I'm not saying that's a good filter.\nUh, I wouldn't get in otherwise.\nAnd so, hopefully, you don't, you're more open.\nYeah.\nWe look for deep mind researchers also.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nDon't worry.\nUm, okay, cool.\nLet's talk a little bit about how you run the company now, right?\nI don't know if you wanted to say how many employees you have.\nYeah, we have about 200.\nOkay, so the company's getting bigger.\nUm, you now have access to code writing AI tools.\nUm, are you guys just like full in on that stuff?\nAre you vibe coding everything?\nHow, what, what's it look like?\nI mean, you, you don't want to wipe code everything, right?\nLike, like, like we frequently run into infra issues, and you don't want a wipe coder right there fixing it on live things on production, like I do want, like, people well trained in regular software engineering, infrastructure, distributed systems, like, you don't want to, like, replace these skills.\nBut yeah, front-end design, that's where we are seeing tremendous adoption, like, cursor is being used by everybody.\nUh, we made it mandatory to use at least one AI coding tool, and internally at Perplexity, it happens to be cursor and like a mix, mix of cursor and GitHub Copilot, but yeah, we definitely made it compulsory, and so the way machine learning people are do using it, AI people are like, sometimes they read a paper, and they can just upload a screenshot of the pseudo code and, uh, ask cursor to, like, just edit the files to implement this new algorithm, and then it's able to, like, uh, write it on unit tests, and then, uh, run an experiment pretty quickly that, uh, is reducing the experimentation time from, like, 3, 4 days to, like, literally 1 hour, or, like, there are people who don't know design, and so sometimes I'm, I just give them feedback where I take a screenshot of my iOS app, and I say, this button needs to move here with an arrow, and they upload my screenshot to cursor, and then ask it to, like, write, write a change to the Swift UI file.\nSo, that level of change is incredible.\nLike, like the speed at which you can fix bugs and ship to production is, is crazy.\nThe more bugs there are, as long as you can fix them fast.\nYeah, bugs are always ahead of, like, how fast people can write code, though.\nBut just, just to be clear, I'm a big fan of all these tools, but it is also introducing new bugs, and many people don't know how to fix them, and they don't even know how the bug got introduced, and they have to go find it again.\nSo, it's not perfect, and I actually like the more newer tools, like, clawed code seems to be far smarter than, like, what cursor is able to do.\nSo, I'm actually like, like, really positive that this is the right future, but there are, there are issues right now.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUm, in talking to a lot of the folks here, one of the major questions that I've heard is, um, as these coding tools get better and better and better, what is the, like, actual enduring value of a company like yours if, if increasingly it's easy to replicate what you have done using these tools?\nWhat's your take on that general type of question?\nI mean, brand definitely has a big value, right?\nLike, there are cursor competitors, Perplexity competitors, like, OpenAI will have, like, their own cursor.\nOpenAI has Perplexity within ChatGPT.\nThat did not kill any of these companies.\nSo, there is a certain brand value that once you acquire at the scale of, like, several millions of users, paying users, you don't actually die that fast.\nYou earn the right to survive and keep building.\nUh, so brand is important.\nUh, narrative is very important to the brand, like, you have to communicate to people why do you even need to exist.\nFor us, it's the focus on accuracy.\nOkay, let there exist 100 chatbots, but we are the most focused on getting as many answers right as possible.\nWe focus on speed, time to first token on app or web, like, we're still the fastest despite doing search.\nUh, we focus a lot on, like, how we present the answer.\nSo, there are some things you are obsessed about because you care about it, and that becomes your narrative and your brand identity.\nAnd if you manage to get a reasonable amount of distribution, not saying 100 million users, but tens of millions, then you earn the right to keep playing the game no matter what other people ship.\nUntil then, it's definitely a challenge.\nYou have to worry about it.\nEven now, we worry about it, and the only solution is to move fast and keep shipping.\nBe beyond brand, like, do you think about any network effect types of things emerging with Perplexity?\nI mean, brand has network effects, right?\nLike, people, people tell each other about the brand, but no AI product has within app network effect, like, like, it's not like WhatsApp, where if you build a WhatsApp rival, Meta has a definitely, like, a questionable brand, right?\nLike, people don't necessarily trust Meta's products, they think, like, these are ad products.\nDespite that, nobody's able to switch off WhatsApp that easily because all your contacts, your groups, everything is there.\nAI doesn't quite have that yet.\nUh, mainly because you can easily export your ChatGPT history, upload it somewhere else, or, uh, things like that.\nI think the browser will definitely be one play to, like, you know, figure this out because as your browsing history and, like, which again, you can still export, but not the same as just getting a dump, a CSV dump, uh, and your passwords, your wallet, your agent remembers you, there's a lot of tasks that are running on the browser that you rely on your day-to-day life and work, that's one way to, like, keep, get the product a lot more sticky and, like, create more network effects, especially if multiple people rely on the same set of tasks, you're sharing it with them.\nThat's one way to get all this into, like, the next level.\nIt also sounds like a lot of the stuff that you aspire to solve for users requires integrations or partnerships or something with a bunch of other companies in the world.\nYeah.\nAnd if you can get those to be good, then there is somewhat of a network effect in the sense that your product will be good, and some competitor would have to build the same integration or same deal with, with these providers.\nWhat does that look like, do you think, in the future?\nLike, does Perplexity do deals with all the airlines in the world and all the hotels and all the e-commerce providers?\nSo, we, we already work with self-book, uh, they power all the hotel bookings natively done on Perplexity.\nWe work with Trip Advisor to surface all the reviews of hotels and different, you know, places.\nWe have, like, collaborations for the maps.\nWe work with Yelp.\nUh, we also, like, you know, for shopping, we have a lot of merchants who are directly selling on us, uh, and then we work with firmly to, like, support the bookings, like, like native purchases.\nSo, there's already a lot of partnerships.\nShopify is one of our partners.\nOn finance, we work with FMP.\nSports, we work with, like, uh, stats perform.\nSo, there's a lot of data providers already working with us to on these verticals, and we just think it's going to expand further as agents start to do things.\nDifferent people are okay with, like, becoming MCP servers.\nSome people are not.\nSome people just want to, like, like, preserve their websites.\nThe browser agent will be generic enough that it'll respect whatever the third party wants because at the end of the day, the agent is the one that's being permitted by the user to act on their behalf.\nAnd, um, if there is no MCP server, it's still fine.\nYou can just use these tabs as if the user would have done it.\nAnd, uh, that's the key advantage of the browser that you do not have if you commit entirely to just the MCP vision.\nIf you commit entirely to MCP vision, you require these third party MCP servers to work reliably.\nUh, the data that they send you, uh, on with the MCP protocol has to be perfect.\nYour chatbot has to, like, like, you know, deal with all these issues that exist.\nOn the other hand, if you just ground up design it as the way a human would use that website, you have full control over, like, how to, how to do it, you don't have to rely on someone else doing the engineering well on their end.\nUm, let's talk next about business model.\nYour main competitor, Google, their business model, as you've talked about, is selling ads.\nUm, and you think that prevents them from being really good at what you're doing.\nSo, what, what will your business model be, and how will you get it to be on the order of magnitude of, of Google's?\nI don't know if you'll ever get order of magnitude profits as Google.\nUh, just to be clear, and I don't think that's needed.\nNo one in the history, even Google themselves, never has had another business that had the margins that Google has.\nSo, it's completely reasonable to get something far, far better than any public company out there right now, and, and way be still way below Google.\nNumber two, I think the subscription revenue is like really encouraging.\nWe never expected to get this far, and then we think, like, we can grow at least, you know, a few billions a year in just subs, which is a great business.\nUsage-based pricing, where people are paying an agent for completing a task, or people have recurring tasks, and they pay based on, you know, every single use of the task, and they normalize this system based on, like, how much it would take to hire a person to do that for them, uh, is going to be a thing.\nI don't exactly know how it's going to play out, what are the margins going to be on that.\nPotentially, it's going to be way better than, um, subscriptions in terms of volume of people who would pay for it, but it might be lower margins because it's usage-based.\nSo, you're still going to be spending on all those queries.\nSomeone\n\n\nMight be paying a subscription to like one of these AI apps and might not have used it for an entire month.\nAnd so that's good margins on that user, right?\nSo I don't actually have a clear sense of how this is all going to like evolve.\nBut all I know is subscriptions and usage-based pricing are going to be a thing.\nTransactions, you know, uh, if people start buying more through AIs, uh, taking a cut out of the transactions is good.\nIt's going to be CPAs have historically been way lower margins than CPCs, which is why Google never became a transaction platform, which is why I said like you're going to make a lot of money here.\nYou may never make as much money as Google.\nYeah.\nGoogle's business model is potentially the best business model ever.\nEver.\nSo, yeah, it's fair to not.\nMaybe it was so good that you needed AI to kill it basically.\nAll right, let's we're going to do some audience Q&A in a little bit, but um before we get there, I kind of wanted to understand your advice for the folks in this room, right?\nLike if you were in their position back whatever it was four years ago, what would you advise they do?\nI would say uh work incredibly hard.\nThere is no substitute for it.\nDon't think like you're very smart like like strategizing the right way to build a company despite all like what big model labs are doing.\nYou should assume that if you have a big hit, if your company is something that can make revenue on the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars or potentially billions of dollars, you should always assume that a model company will copy it.\nMainly because they are really looking for revenue.\nThey raise like tens of billions or close to 50 billion and they need to justify all that capex spend and they need to keep searching for new ways to make money.\nSo they will copy anything that's good.\nI think you got to live with that fear.\nYou have to embrace it and realize that like your mode comes from moving fast and building your own identity around what you're doing because users at the end care.\nLike when you're trying to get like a specific person for your house help, you are searching for that specific person, and you're not like going for a general agency that handles all of it.\nSo, um, I think there's like like real benefit from embracing that fear and like sleeping with that fear and waking up every day and like feeling excited about what you're going to build because that's the only thing that'll keep you going.\nWell, you guys are the perfect example of how it's possible to go up against somebody as big as Google.\nThat's great.\nAll right, let's do some Q&A.\nWe'll start on the left side here.\nGo for it.\nUh, hi, my name is Sammy and I just want to personally thank you for helping me get a 100 in my theory of knowledge course.\nUh, would not have been able to do it without you.\nNo shame.\nUm, quick question for you.\nUh, you know, with your recent partnership with Nvidia to ship AI models across Europe, um, there's been talks about Perplexity being installed on um, all Samsung phones or pre-installed.\nUm, and that could lift your valuation towards 14 billion uh, according to sources like Bloomberg.\nUm, it's a heavy responsibility being the default search engine for you know the mainstream population.\nWhat do you think are the most important factors at Perplexity to prevent hallucinations or incorrect uh data from you know being given to the masses?\nThank you so much.\nThank you.\nUh, hallucinations is something we we really care about.\nWe we're building benchmarks internally uh to keep up to date with that.\nThe only way there is to keep building a better search index.\nUh, keep capturing better snippets of all the web pages and then like these models like like you know are getting fast enough that you can have them reason multistep for every query without incurring too much cost and so that's another way to reduce hallucinations.\nI I want to ask you about like the innovator's dilemma.\nSo, if you were in Sundar's shoes or in um in like the Google co-founder's shoes, like what would you do and how would you kind of come up with maybe changing their business model even if it's a worse model?\nSo, if you were running Google competing against yourself, what would you do?\nI I think I don't envy that job at all.\nUm, I I nobody in the world wants that job.\nIt's it's it's a very difficult job.\nWould you sacrifice the business model in order to get like a new get the next product or would you ship it as a separate product?\nLike if you're Google, would you just build a separate thing that is the Perplexity competitor and and sacrifice the distribution advantage that you have in the short run?\nYeah, I I don't like genuinely I don't know.\nI think uh I can say all what I want but they have more data on like what their users are doing and um there are a lot of people in the world who hate AI by the way so I think just throwing AI down people's throats on such a you know massive distribution area is not easy what I would do I would I definitely don't know and I I don't want to be in that position also by the way if if if ads are part of every AI answer you're going to hate it too um and and so um it's good that there there's alternatives like us.\nAll right.\nHey Aravind, my name is Akshad.\nUh, so in a recent interview with Nikil Kamat, he asked you for an internship at Perplexity.\nSo I was just wondering how that um arrangement is going.\nHe he came he came to the office.\nHe spent a couple of days.\nI mean he hasn't posted about it.\nSo I'll let him post about it.\nBut I we did spend time with him.\nUh, it was not a proper internship but we did speak to him for a while.\nI want to start by saying thank you very much for your very candid answers.\nI really appreciated that.\nSo um a lot of startups they find some like cool application of foundation models and then they'll like build something off of that but then if it does gain traction then the foundation models will consolidate that into their own infrastructure.\nAnd Perplexity sort of has that issue too with like a lot of LMS adding search like TAGBT, Gemini, companies like Coher.\nSo I was just wondering like how would you approach something like that?\nWould you try to pivot just get better at what you do or I think I would say uh pick something you want to like be known for?\nUh yes there are other people integrating search but we still want to be the fastest and most accurate and obviously I cannot just say that and and then stop like we need to figure out a new strategy too and and build new products that don't exist yet.\nUh so our browser will be that bet for us and browser and search are not two distinctive products.\nThey're actually like the browser is a natural graduation step from search just like how Google graduated from Google search to Chrome and Chrome is the main reason they got billions of daily queries from hundreds of millions.\nSo when Google IPOed they had no browser and they had like maybe a 100 million queries now you know like it's like 10 billion or something.\nSo the browser is an important part of that and then so that's why we we are making a massive bet on that and agents can only be built with a browser.\nI'm very like convinced about that vision that if you want to have a mobile agent that you can actually build and implement without being restricted by whatever OS rules that Apple or Google sets in terms of not being able to call third party apps.\nExpecting every mobile app to have MCP servers and then like connecting all their data to your thing is not going to be that straightforward.\nLike nobody wants to be disintermediated by an AI that quickly.\nSo the browser will be a great way to build all these things.\nThank you.\nSo as a lot of us here have done um we've tried we've failed at our startups um you know some of us have been more successful than others some like me have failed when you're in that moment failing over and over again.\nWhat do you tell yourself as CEO or as an entrepreneur to to win to teach yourself to win?\nWhat what do I tell myself when I feel like I might fail?\nYeah.\nOr when you're in that very specific moment of failing where you feel like everything's crashing down on you or this feature isn't working or this bug has popped up, how do you get through that and what do you think your biggest motivational factor is in that realm?\nOr maybe like at the beginning before it started to take off, what gave you the hope to keep working on it versus just go back to OpenAI and get your job?\nI just watched uh the Elon Musk videos on YouTube.\nNo, I'm serious.\n[Applause]\nI I can tell you which video.\nThere's a video where there's like a third failure in a row and like what do you think?\nAnd he's like I don't ever give up.\nI would have to be dead or incapacitated.\nSo you'd say you're also never going to give up?\nYeah, I I hope to I hope to like stay that way.\nIt's not easy.\nUh I think he's done it for way longer and that's why you all like respect him.\nBut that's you know there are examples of great entrepreneurs who have done this despite all the odds stacked against them.\nSo what do you have to lose?\nJust keep going.\nThank you.\nYeah.\n[Applause]\nUh yeah my question is about uh kind of the sustainability of perpetuity not in terms of the business model but just in terms of the web in general.\nUm, you know, a lot of studies have come out recently showing that AI search engines like Perplexity drive a lot less traffic to websites.\nSo, I'm curious, what do you think like the web will look like in 5 to 10 years when a lot of these websites, you know, they're not getting as much traffic and so they have to kind of cease their operations and like the web will just be a lot quieter of a place for content creation.\nHow do you think Perplexity fits into that?\nAnd what do you think the web will look like in that era?\nI think that there are going to be uh, you know, the web is already pretty long tail uh, and there's a massive power loss.\nSo I I feel like the parallel is going to get even more skewed.\nThat is very obvious.\nThere are going to be certain brands that are wellnown and they're going to preserve direct organic visits, but those who are trying to game the SEO system and trying to get traffic, I think they're definitely going to have a harder time.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nHi Rean, good afternoon.\nUh firstly, where do you place the line between summarization and plagiarism in report generation?\nAnd how do you avoid IP violations in your product?\nAnd secondly, how do you deal with political bias?\nBias and political sorry, political bias and personal interest in news articles and other human written sources.\nYeah, I think there are cases where you actually have objective truth, right?\nLike what was the score in the NBA game?\nWhat is the live weather right now in San Francisco where you don't want to you don't want to be wrong ever on those queries and and people know what is true but you even there you're trusting right like you're trusting some data provider who's tracking the live game the TV that's showing you the number or Apple or Google's like acute weather all these things so at some point it all relies on trust and trust is built over time based on being being accurate reliably and so trying to surface the right data from the right people who have earned the right to like like be surface in AI is is how we think about it for accuracy.\nNow there are things that don't have one clear accurate answer.\nI think there the best thing we can do is offer all the perspectives and not really take a clear opinion on like what is right and wrong when there's no clear uh answer to that question.\nDo you measure how accurate you are at that job by user feedback in some way?\nWe don't actually measure it today.\nWe we should an eval set uh should be built for that like like questions where there is no one objective answer.\nThe problem with building an automated eval for for that type of thing is what what what is the right answer?\nIt's subjective, right?\nLike like if if there are questions about the origins of co and there's so many different opinions of that relying a lot on Wikipedia as a source and and you know can say maybe for a human raider you're like okay saying all the things Wikipedia said it's a good answer but maybe what you want is to say stuff that is not there in Wikipedia and that relies on like having a much better human evaluators like pool much smarter people who who are supposed to rate these things and they're not like available for like you scale AI style evaluations.\nRight.\nRight.\nOkay.\nI think we have time for one final question.\nYou get it?\nAwesome.\nHi, my name is Angela.\nThank you so much for talking to us.\nI have a question about your go to market strategy.\nYou had a great campaign for students.\nThat's how I and assume many college students learn about you guys.\nBut then also you had a collaboration with Koshi which is a little bit different audience.\nSo I'm just trying to understand how do you decide which audience you're trying to get?\nI think like what one one perspective here is trying to get into distributions of users that you don't typically have access to on your traditional marketing channels.\nYou know, there are a lot of people who don't use Twitter or LinkedIn and and and and they're all like they all exist in the world.\nWe just are living in a bubble here.\nU and and there are some other businesses that have good access to them.\nUh like you know traditional businesses like like you could imagine the the kind of people who use Costco regularly may not even be using AI on a regular basis and so if that's the kind of people you're going for then it makes sense to change your strategy to reach them but also remember that uh it's good to grow with adjacencies like you do want to have some overlapping sets of people who would be the word of mouth carriers as they help you expand to more you know non-over overlappinging circles.\nSo I think that that's how I think about it.\nLike there should be some overlap, but your distribution should keep evolving over time.\nThank you.\nAll right, Aravind, thanks for joining us.\nThank you everybody.\n",
