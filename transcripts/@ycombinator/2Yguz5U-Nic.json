  "cleanText": "This is something of a nice change.\nI've given a lot of scientific talks and no one claps and cheers when I come on.\nNot normally, even when I come on.\nIt's really exciting.\nIt's really wonderful to be here.\nI guess I should start off assuming that not everyone in this cavernous hall knows who I am.\nWho am I?\nI'm someone who has done some work in AI for science who really believes that we can use the AI systems, these technologies, these ideas to change the world in a very specific way, to make science go faster, to enable new discoveries.\nI think it's really, really wonderful.\nWe have the opportunity to take these tools, these ideas and aim them toward the question of how can we build the right AI systems so that sick people can become healthy and go home from the hospital.\nAnd it's been kind of a really wonderful and winding journey for me to end up here.\nI was originally trained as a physicist.\nI thought I was going to be a laws of the universe physicist.\nIf I was very, very lucky, I could do something that would end up one sentence in a textbook.\nAnd I did physics and I went to actually do a PhD in physics.\nAnd then kind of what I was working on didn't really grab me.\nI just, it didn't feel like what I wanted to do.\nSo I dropped out.\nI didn't start a startup.\nThat would have been very on point for this event, but I, uh, dropped out and I ended up working at a company that was doing computational biology.\nHow do we get computers to say something smart about biology?\nAnd I loved it.\nI loved it not just because it was fun, but it was something that would let me do what I thought I was good at: write code, manipulate equations, think hard thoughts about the nature of the world and use it toward this very applied purpose that at the end we want to enable, we want to make medicines or we want to enable others to make medicines.\nThen I really kind of became a biologist and a machine learner.\nActually a machine learner because I left that job and I went back to grad school in biophysics and chemistry and, uh, I no longer had access to this incredible computer hardware that I had when I was working at my previous job, and in fact, they had custom ASICs for simulating how proteins, this part of your body that I'll talk about, move.\nAnd since I didn't have that anymore, but I still wanted to work on the same problems, well, I didn't want to just do the same thing with less compute.\nAnd so I started to learn and I was getting very interested in statistics, in machine learning.\nWe didn't call it AI back then.\nIn fact, we didn't even call it machine learning.\nThat was a bit disreputable.\nI said, I'm working in statistical physics.\nBut you know, how are we going to develop algorithms?\nHow are we going to learn from data and do that instead of very large compute?\nAnd I guess it turns out in terms of AI, in addition to very large compute, to answer new problems.\nAnd after this, I joined Google DeepMind and really joining a company that wanted to say, how are we going to take these powerful technologies and all kind of these ideas, and we, they were becoming very, very readily apparent how powerful these technologies were with applications, uh, to especially games, but also to things like data centers and others.\nHow are we going to take these technologies and use them to advance science and really push forward scientific frontier?\nAnd how can we do this in an industrial setting with an incredibly fast pace, working with some really smart people, working with great computer resources, and with all that, you darn well better make some progress.\nAnd it's been really, really fun, and the fact that I'm on this stage indicates that we made some progress.\nAnd I think it really, the guiding principle for me has been that when we do this work, that ultimately we are building tools that will enable scientists to make discoveries.\nAnd what I think is really heartening about the work we've done and the part that really I think still just resonates with me at my core is there about, I think, 35,000 citations of AlphaFold.\nBut within that is there are tens of thousands of examples of people using our tools to do science that I couldn't do on my own, but are using it to make discoveries, be it vaccines, be it drug development, be it how the body works.\nAnd I think that's really, really exciting.\nAnd the part I want to talk to you about today and the story I want to tell you is a bit about the problem, a bit about how we did it.\nAnd I think especially the role of research and machine learning research and the fact that it isn't just off-the-shelf machine learning, and then I want to tell you a little bit about what happens when you make something great and how people use it and what it does for the world.\nSo, I'll start with the world's shortest biology lesson.\nThe cell is complex.\nUm, for people who have only studied biology in high school or in college, you might have this idea that the cell is a couple parts that have labels attached to them, and it's kind of simple, but really it looks much more like what you see on the screen.\nIt's dense.\nIt's complex.\nUh, in terms of crowding, it's like the swimming pool on the 4th of July, and it's in full of enormous complexity.\nHumans have about 20,000 different types of proteins.\nThose are some of the blobs you see on the screen.\nThey come together to do practically every function in your cell.\nYou can see that, uh, kind of green tail is the psyllium of, uh, an ecoli.\nThat's how it moves around.\nAnd you can see in fact how it moves around.\nAnd you can see that thing that looks like it turns, and in fact it turns and drives this motor.\nAll of this is made of proteins.\nWhen people say that DNA is the instruction manual for life, well, this is what it's telling you how to do.\nIt's telling you how to build these tiny machines.\nAnd biology has evolved an incredible mechanism to build the machines it needs, literal nano machines, and build them out of atoms.\nAnd so your DNA gives you instructions that say build a protein.\nNow you might say your DNA is aligned and I am very much not one-dimensional, what happens in between?\nAnd the answer is, after you make this protein and assemble it one piece at a time, it will fold up spontaneously into a shape like you've opened your IKEA bookshelf and instead of having to do the hard work, it simply builds itself and you get this quite complex structure.\nYou can see quite typical protein, a kynise for those of you who are biologists in the audience over there.\nAnd you can see this very complex arrangement of atoms, and that arrangement is functional, and and the majority, not everyone, of the proteins, uh, in your body undergo this transformation, and that is what functions, and that is incredibly small.\nSo light itself is a few hundred nanometers in size, and that's a few nanometers in size.\nSo it's smaller than you can see in a microscope.\nAnd for a long time, scientists have wanted to understand this structure because they use it to predict how changes in that protein might affect disease.\nHow does that work?\nHow does biology work?\nOften if you make a drug, it is to interrupt the function of a certain protein like this one.\nNow scientists have, through an incredible amount of cleverness, figured out the structure of lots of proteins, and it remains to this day exceptionally difficult.\nRight?\nYou shouldn't imagine this as, I want to determine the structure of a protein.\nSo I shall open the lab protocol for protein structure determination.\nI shall follow the steps.\nIt consists of cleverness of ideas of finding many ways.\nIn this case, I'm describing one type of protein structure prediction in or protein structure, sorry, determination, experimental measurement, where you convince that big ugly molecule I just showed you to form a regular crystal, kind of like table salt.\nNo one has an easy recipe for this.\nSo, they try many things.\nThey have ideas, and it's exceptionally difficult and filled with failure like many things in science.\nAnd you're really looking at kind of one way to get an idea of how difficult this is.\nJust one kind of ordinary paper that we were using.\nI flipped to the back and it said, you know, in their protocol, after more than a year, crystals began to form.\nRight?\nSo, not only did they do all these hard experiments, but they had to wait about a year to find out if it worked.\nAnd probably that year wasn't spent waiting.\nIt was trying a thousand other things that didn't work as well.\nOnce you do that, you can take this to a, uh, synretron, a modest thing.\nYou can see the cars rigging the outside of this instrument so that you can shine incredibly bright X-rays on it and get what is called a defraction pattern, and you can solve that, and you can deposit it in what's called the PDB or the protein datab bank.\nAnd one of the things that enabled the work we did is that scientists 50 years ago had the foresight to say these are important, these are hard.\nWe should collect them all in one place.\nSo there's a data set that represents ex essentially all the academic output of protein structures in the community and available to everyone.\nSo our work was on very public data.\nAbout 200,000 protein structures are known.\nThey pretty regularly increase at about 12,000 a year.\nBut this is much, much smaller than the need.\nGetting the kind of input information, the DNA that tells you about a protein is much, much, much, much easier.\nSo billions of protein sequences are being discovered.\nAbout 3,000 times faster are we learning about protein sequence than protein structure.\nOkay, that's all scientific content, but I should talk to you about the little thing we did which has this kind of schematic diagram.\nWe wanted to build an AI system.\nIn fact, we didn't even care if it was an AI system.\nThat's one of the nice things about, uh, working in AI for science is you don't care how you solve it.\nIf it ended up being a computer program, if it ended up being anything else, we want to find some way to get from the left where each of those letters represents a specific building block of the protein considered an order.\nWe want to put something in the middle in the AlphaFold, and we want to end up with something on the right.\nAnd you'll see, uh, two structures there if you look closely, where the blue is our prediction and the green is the experimental structure that took someone a year or two of effort.\nIf you want to put an economic value on it on the order of $100,000, and you can see we were able to do this, and I want to tell you how.\nAnd there were really three components to doing this or to do any machine learning problem, and you can say you have data, and you have compute, and you have research.\nAnd I feel like we tell too many stories about the first two and not enough about the third.\nIn data, we had 200,000 protein structures.\nEveryone has the same data.\nIn terms of compute, this isn't LLM scale.\nIt's the final model itself was 128 TPU v3 cores, roughly equivalent to a GPU per core for two weeks.\nThis is again within the scope of, say, academic resources, but it's worth saying, really, most of your compute when you think about how much compute you need, don't get distracted by the number for the final model.\nThe real cost of compute is the cost of ideas that didn't work, all the things you had to do to get there, and then finally research, and I would say this is all but about two people that worked on this.\nIt's a small group of people that end up doing this.\nSo really, when you look at these machine learning breakthroughs, they're probably fewer people than you imagine, and really this is where our work was differentiated.\nWe came up with a new set of ideas on how do we bring machine learning to this problem, and I can say earlier systems largely based on convolutional neural networks did okay.\nThey certainly made progress.\nIf you replace that with a transformer, you're honestly about the same.\nIf you take the ideas of a transformer and much experimentation and many more ideas, then that's when you start to get real change.\nAnd in almost all the AI systems you can see today, a tremendous amount of research and ideas and what I would call midscale ideas are involved.\nIt isn't just about the headlines where people will say transformers, you know, scaling, test time inference.\nThese are all important, but they're one of many ingredients in a really powerful system, and in fact, we can measure how much our research was worth.\nSo someone, AlphaFold 2 is the system that is quite famous, the one that, uh, was quite a large improvement.\nAlphaFold 1 was the best in the world, but someone did, uh, the Alcesi lab did a very, uh, careful experiment where they took AlphaFold 2, the architecture, and they trained it on 1% of the available data, and they could show that AlphaFold 2 trained on 1% of the data was as accurate or more accurate as AlphaFold 1, which was the state-of-the-art system previously.\nSo there's a very clean thing that says that the third, uh, the third of these ingredients, research, was worth a hundredfold of the first of these ingredients, data.\nAnd I think this is generally really, really important that one of the big, as you're all thinking, as you're all in startups or thinking about startups, think about the amount to which ideas, research, discoveries amplify data, amplify compute, they work together with it.\nWe wouldn't want to use less data than we have, we wouldn't want to use less compute than we have available, but ideas are a core component when you're doing machine learning research, and they really helped to transform the world.\nYC's Next Batch is now taking applications.\nGot a startup in you?\nApply at ycombinator.com/apply.\nIt's never too early.\nAnd filling out the app will level up your idea.\nOkay, back to the video.\nWe can even go back and we can do ablations and we can say what parts matter.\nAnd don't focus too much on the details.\nWe pulled this from our paper.\nYou can see here this is the difference compared to the baseline.\nAnd you take either of those and you can see that each of the ideas that you might remove from our final system, kind of discreet, identifiable ideas, some of which were incredibly popular research areas within the field, like this work came out and a part of it was equivariant, and people said equivariance, that is the answer.\nAlphaFold is an equivariant system, and it's great, we must do more research on equivariance to get even more great systems.\nWell, I was very confused by this because the sixth, uh, row there, no IPA invariant point attention, that removes all the equivariance in AlphaFold and it hurts a bit, but only a bit.\nAlphaFold itself on this GDT scale that you can see on the left graph.\nAlphaFold 2 was about 30 GDT better than AlphaFold.\n\n\nOne and\nequivariance explains two or three of\nthis. It isn't about one idea. It's\nabout many midscale ideas that add up to\na transformative system. And it's very\nvery important when you're building\nthese systems to think about what we\nwould call in this context biological\nrelevance. We would have ideas that were\nbetter. We kind of got our system\ngrinding 1% at a time. But what really\nmattered was when we crossed the\naccuracy that it mattered to an\nexperimental biologist who didn't care\nabout machine learning. And you have to\nget there through a lot of work and a\nlot of effort. And when you do, it is\nincredibly transformative. And we can\nmeasure against this axis where the\ndark blue axis the other systems\navailable at the time. And this was\nassessed. Protein structure prediction\nis in some ways far ahead of LLMs or\nthe general machine learning space and\nhaving blind assessment. Since 1994,\nevery two years, everyone interested in\npredicting the structure of proteins\ngets together and predicts the structure\nof a hundred proteins whose answer isn't\nknown to anyone except the research\ngroup that just solved it, right?\nUnpublished. And so, you really do know\nwhat works. And we had about a third of\nthe error of any other group on this\nassessment. But it matters because once\nyou are working on problems in which you\ndon't know the answer, you get to really\nmeasure how good things are. And you can\nreally find that a lot of systems don't\nlive up to what people believe over the\ncourse of their research. And because\neven if you have a benchmark, we all\noverfit to our ideas to the benchmark,\nright? Unless you have held out. And in\nfact, the problems you have in the real\nworld are almost always harder than the\nproblems you train on, right? Because\nyou have to learn from much data and you\napply it to very important singular\nproblems. So it is very very important\nthat you measure well both as you're\ndeveloping and when people are trying to\ndecide whether they should use your\nsystem. External benchmarks are\nabsolutely critical to figuring out what\nworks and that's what really helps drive\nthe world forward. So just some\nwonderful examples of this is typical\nperformance for us. These are blind\npredictions. You can see they're pretty\ndarn good. Also important we made it\navailable and we thought it was and we\ndid a lot of assessment but we decided\nthat it was very important to make it\navailable in two ways. One is that we\nopen source the code and we actually\nopen sourced the code about a week\nbefore we released a database of\npredictions starting originally at\n300,000 predictions and later going to\n200 million essentially every protein um\nfrom an organism whose genome has been\nsequenced. And this made an enormous\ndifference. And one of the most\ninteresting kind of sociological things\nis this huge difference between when we\nreleased a piece of code that\nspecialists could use and we got some\ninformation and then when we made it\navailable to the world in this database\nform. It was really interesting kind of\nyou know you release something and every\nday you check Twitter to find out or\ncheck X to find out what's going on. And\nwhat we would really see is even after\nthat CASP assessment, I would say that\nthe structure predictors were convinced\nthis obviously was this enormous advance\nsolved the problem. But general\nbiologists, the people we wanted to use,\nthe people who didn't care about\nstructure prediction, they cared about\nproteins to do their experiments, they\nweren't as sure. They said, \"Well, maybe\nCASP was easy. I don't know.\" And then\nthis database came out and people got\ncurious and they clicked in and the\namount to which the proof was social was\nextraordinary that people would look and\nsay how did DeepMind get access to my\nunpublished structure. You know, this\nmoment at which they really believed it\nthat everyone had a protein either had\na protein that they hadn't solved or had\na friend who had a protein that was\nunpublished and they could compare and\nthat's what really made the difference.\nAnd having this database, this\naccessibility, this ease led everyone to\ntry it and figure out how it worked.\nWord of mouth is really how this trust\nis built. And you can kind of see some\nof these testimonials, right? I wrestled\nfor three to four months trying to do\nthis scientific task. You know, this\nmorning I got an AlphaFold prediction\nand now it's much better. I want my time\nback, right? You know, you really\nappreciate AlphaFold when you run it on\na protein that for a year refused to get\nexpressed and purified. Meaning they for\na year they couldn't even get the\nmaterial to start experiments. These are\nreally important. When you build the\nright tool, when you solve the right\nproblem, it matters and it changes the\nlives of people who are doing things not\nthat you would do but building on top of\nyour work. And I think it's just\nextraordinary to see these and the\nnumber of people I talked to. The time\nthat I really knew this tool mattered.\nIn fact, there was a special issue of\nScience on the nuclear pore complex a\nfew months after the tool came out. And\nthe special issue was all about this\nparticular very large kind of several\nhundred protein system. And three out of\nthe four papers in Science about this\nmade extensive use of AlphaFold. I\nthink I counted over a hundred mentions\nof the word AlphaFold in Science and we\nhad nothing to do with it. We didn't\nknow it was happening. We weren't\ncollaborating. It was just people doing\nnew science on top of the tools we had\nbuilt and that is the greatest feeling\nin the world. And in fact, users do the\ndarnest things. They will use tools in\nways you didn't know were possible. The\ntweet on the left from Yoshaka Morowaki\ncame out two days after our code was\navailable. We had predicted the\nstructure of individual proteins, but we\nconsider we were working on building a\nsystem that would predict how proteins\ncame together. But this researcher said,\n\"Well, I have AlphaFold. Why don't\nI just put two proteins together and\nI'll put something in between?\" You\ncould think of this as prompt\nengineering but for proteins. And\nsuddenly they find out this is the best\nprotein interaction prediction in the\nworld, right? That when you train on\nthese a really really powerful system,\nit will have additional in some sense\nemergent skills as long as they're\naligned. People started to find all\nsorts of problems that AlphaFold would\nwork on that we hadn't anticipated. It\nwas so interesting to see the field of\nscience in real time reacting to the\nexistence of these tools, finding their\nlimitations, finding their possibilities\nand this continues and people do all\nsorts of exciting work be it in protein\ndesign be it in others on top of either\nthe ideas and often the systems we have\nbuilt. One application that really I\nthought was really important is that\npeople have started to learn how to use\nit to engineer big proteins or to use it\nin part of and I want to tell this story\nfor two reasons. One is I think it's a\nreally cool application but the second\nis how it really changes the work of\nscience and often people will say\nscience is all about experiments and\nvalidation. So it's great that you have\nall these AlphaFold predictions. Now\nall we have to do is solve all the\nproteins the classic way so that we can\ntell whether your predictions are right\nor wrong. And they're right about one\nthing. Science is about experiments.\nScience is about doing these\nexperiments.\nBut they're wrong about another thing.\nUm science is about making hypotheses\nand testing them not about the structure\nof a particular protein. In this case,\nthe question was they took this protein\non the left called the contractile\ninject injection system, but that's a\nmouthful. They like to call it the\nmolecular syringe. And what it does is\nit attaches to a cell and injects a\nprotein into it. And the scientists at\nthe Jang Lab at MIT were saying,\nwell, can we use this protein\nto do targeted drug delivery? Can we use\nit to get gene editors like cast 9 into\nthe cell? They tried over a hundred\nmethods to figure out how to take this\nprotein, which they didn't have a\nstructure of. This is just kind of a\nrendition after the fact, and say, how\ncan we change what it recognizes? I\nthink it's originally involved in plant\ndefense or something like that, and they\ndidn't know how to do it. And they ran\nan AlphaFold prediction. You can see\nthe one on the left. I wouldn't even say\nit's a great AlphaFold prediction, but\nalmost immediately they looked at that\nand said, \"Wait a minute. those legs at\nthe bottom are how it must recognize and\nattach to cells. Why don't we just\nreplace those with a designed protein?\nAnd so almost immediately as soon as\nthey got the AlphaFold prediction, they\nre-engineered to add this design protein\nthat you see in red to target a new\ntype of cell. And they take this system\nand then they show in fact that they can\nchoose cells within a mouse and they can\ninject proteins in this case fluorescent\nproteins. So there you'll see the color\nand they can target the cells they want\nwithin a mouse brain. And so they are\nusing this to develop a new type of\nsystem\nof targeted drug discovery. And we see\nmany more examples. We see some in which\nscientists are using this tool to try\nthousands and thousands of interactions\nto figure out which ones are likely to\nbe the case. In fact, discovered a new\ncomponent of how eggs and sperm come\ntogether in fertilization. Many many of\nthese discoveries that are built on top\nof this. And I like to think that our\nwork made the whole field of what's\ncalled structural biology, biology that\ndeals with structures, you know, five or\n10% faster. But the amount to which that\nmatters for the world is enormous and we\nwill have more of these discoveries. And\nI think ultimately structure prediction\nand larger AI for science should be\nthought of as an incredible capability\nto be an amplifier for the work of\nexperimentalists that we start from\nthese scattered observations, these\nnatural data. This is our equivalent of\nall the words on the internet. And then\nwe train a general model that\nunderstands the rules underneath it and\ncan fill in the rest of the picture. And\nI think that we will continue to see\nthis pattern and it will get more\ngeneral that we will find the right\nfoundational data sources in order to do\nthis. And I think the other thing that\nhas really been a property is that you\nstart where you have data but then you\nfind what problems it can be applied to.\nAnd so we find enormous advance,\nenormous capability to understand\ninteractions in the cell or others that\nare downstream of extracting the\nscientific content of these predictions\nand then the rules they use can be\nadapted to new purposes. And I think\nthis is really where we see the\nfoundational model aspect of AlphaFold\nor other narrow systems. And in fact, I\nthink we will start to see this on more\ngeneral systems, be them LLMs or others,\nthat we will find more and more\nscientific knowledge within them and\nwe'll use them for important important\npurposes. And I think this is really\nwhere this is going. And I think the\nmost exciting question in AI for science\nis how general will it be. Will we find\na couple of narrow places where we have\ntransformative impact or will we have\nvery very broad systems? And I expect it\nwill ultimately be the latter as we\nfigure it out. Thank you.\n",
