  "cleanText": "Hey everyone.\nIn this video, I want to talk about starting a small business and what you need to set up online to get started.\nSo, I know a lot of you are starting small businesses, whether it's some kind of software consulting business or a web design business, maybe you're selling themes.\nThere's a bunch of businesses you can start.\nAnd actually, myself, I run an education business.\nSo, at ByteGrad Sp. z o.o., we do online courses.\nIt's mostly a one-time purchase and people get access to a series of videos.\nBut actually, I wanted to do some more one-on-one consulting.\nSo actually I've been exploring some kind of coaching business where I could do tutoring one-on-one with somebody wanting to become a more senior developer, maybe do code reviews and things like that.\nSo actually in this video I want to go through the steps here to create a really good digital presence for a small business like that.\nSo I will just use my example throughout the video.\nSo what what are we going to need?\nWell, obviously we're going to need a domain name and also a website.\nThis is where I start whenever I have a new business idea.\nA decent, ideally some kind of catchy domain name.\nAnd then of course we want to have a beautiful website as well.\nThis is where users, people are still going.\nWebsites are not going away for a long time.\nPeople want to learn about your business.\nThey want to learn the details and a website allows us to do some other things as well like some kind of booking calendar or appointment functionality.\nSo I could display some kind of calendar on my website and then people themselves can schedule themselves an appointment and all without contacting me.\nRight?\nSo this is another benefit of having a website at least if you're doing a service type of business.\nNow if you're selling a product, you want to have some kind of e-commerce store functionality.\nAnd of course, we want to have online payments as well.\nEven if you do the service in person, I would say online payments are still important because it's just a lot of hassle to deal with physical money.\nSo the ability for people to pay online is just very convenient.\nEmail is critical.\nIt's basically the only marketing channel that you have that allows you to communicate with your customers directly without the distractions that some kind of social media platform has.\nRight?\nSo over time, you really want to build up like an email list and have that ability to contact your customers directly.\nBut of course, we do want to have some kind of presence on social media as well.\nThis is simply where people are these days.\nAnd you want to be where your customers or ideal customers are.\nSo typically, it's going to be some social media platform.\nSo, if they're on Instagram, for example, you may want to create some Instagram posts.\nNow, to do all of this, previously, you had to glue together a bunch of different tools, and it was very cumbersome, actually.\nBut I'm going to use GoDaddy in this video.\nThey are also today's sponsor.\nI had a great time using them.\nThey provide all of these things in their platform, so I don't have to go anywhere else.\nThey're using a lot of AI, so it's actually really, really easy.\nAnd you may actually know them from Domain Names.\nThis is really how they became very well known for their Domain Names.\nAnd they are really good at that.\nBut these days they have so much more.\nAnd so they have websites, email, all sorts of marketing tools.\nThey have way more than just Domain Names.\nI view it as an all-in-one platform.\nSo, so in this video, I want to walk you through it and really help you get set up with your digital presence.\nIf you want to follow along, you can find a link in the description.\nAll right.\nBut let's say I want to have the domain bitegrad coaching.com.\nI will search for it here.\nAnd I'm in luck.\nIt is actually available.\nNow, if you don't know which one to pick, they do have a free Domain Name generator as well.\nSo, here I can say I want to have some kind of developer coaching front end full stack backend, right?\nSomething like that.\nLet me actually see what it comes up with.\nAll right.\nSo, here we get a couple of suggestions.\nI actually like it.\nThe my developer coach, really good one actually.\nAI developer.\nYes, the dev coach.\nAlso like that one.\nSo actually pretty good set of options here.\nSo if you don't know which domain you want, make sure to check out their name generator.\nHowever, in this case, I will go with this one.\nI I I basically just want the .com, but they also have a bundle here.\nSo if you do want to have these other ones as well, you can use those.\nAll right.\nSo I'm going to go with bitegrad coaching.\nAll right.\nSo it comes with free domain privacy.\nThat's really nice.\nUm they actually offer an even more comprehensive protection option here, which they do recommend.\nSo there are some additional protections in place.\nNow in the beginning we're not going to have our website completely finished yet.\nSo we may want to have something like coming soon and they allow us to do that here.\nAll right.\nSo here we also have the ability to add a custom email.\nTypically we do want to have a professional-look email.\nSo we don't want to have something like bitegradcoaching@gmail.com which looks kind of cheap and not so professional.\nSo we do want to have you my name Wesley bygradcoaching.com.\nFor example, I will go with this option here.\nIt also allows you to do things like support ad.\nSo you can use different emails for your business and the emails will land in the appropriate inbox.\nOkay, so I will go with this.\nAll right.\nSo I can register the domain name here for 3 years and there's a discount.\nUh but can it be even longer actually if you want.\nWe have protection.\nWe have the Microsoft essentials option.\nAnd the domain comes with GoDaddy Arrow.\nThis is a bit of a new offering they have which is basically their AI experience.\nSo you will have that coming soon website.\nIt will be generated with the help of AI logo of course.\nWe don't have to design it ourselves.\nWe can do a lot of that here with AI.\nSo it helps us get started even faster.\nSo you just pick the options you want.\nAnd I will just go ahead and pay here.\nAll right.\nAnd now my domain is mine.\nSo let's actually continue here and see what we get.\nAll right.\nSo here with GoDaddy Arrow, we can immediately set up like a coming soon page.\nWe can say this is going to be for bitegrad developer coaching something like that and it's going to be some kind of career coach.\nSo it correctly inferred that already from the information I gave could be also consulting something like that I will leave.\nAll right so it looks good.\nLet's actually publish.\nAll right so there we go.\nSo now if I go to my domain let's actually see bitegradcoaching.com.\nIf I press enter here I have my domain right here including a contact us form as well.\nIt's a very nice and quick way to get a coming soon page.\nAll right.\nSo then here we are in the GoDaddy dashboard and here we now want to build out the complete digital presence.\nRight.\nSo now we have a domain name.\nWe have an initial website but of course we want a more professional website.\nRight now we are going to offer a service.\nSo I would want to have some kind of appointment scheduler on the website.\nUm we're not going to sell physical products but I will show you that they offer that as well.\nOnline payment.\nSo they I want to have them pay before we meet.\nFor example and email and social media options as well.\nSo on the left side here we basically see those options that we want.\nSo here we have an option for domain where you can manage your domain settings like DNS renewal and then here for the website we have the settings for our website.\nNow we want a full site.\nSo let's actually go there.\nSo it will actually help us set up a website here as well.\nSo actually with GoDaddy Arrow here we're also setting up the full website.\nSo we can pick the style that we want.\nBold and this is what we will get and actually looks good to me.\nBut maybe you have some different style that you prefer.\nI like bold.\nLet's continue here.\nAll right.\nSo then we can pick the actual subscription here for for GoDaddy here.\nSo we can get access to all of those features as well.\nRight.\nSo we just paid for the domain, but we do have to pay for that complete set of features as well, which I think is fair.\nIt's still a very good price quality ratio.\nSo, we want to have that website.\nWe want to have our email.\nWe want to have these marketing tools.\nBut in my case, I also want to have book and accept payments for appointment.\nSo, I'm going to go with this plan here.\nBut there's an even more powerful option.\nSo, in case you do want to have unlimited products on online store, in that case, consider picking the commerce plan.\nI will go with premium for now.\nActually, you can pick between monthly and yearly.\nSo, if you find a plan that you like, go ahead and pick that.\nI will pick a plan here as well.\nWhen you pick a plan, they give you the option here to add this trusted site badge as well.\nSo, this is a very popular badge.\nYou may have seen it around and I think it does give people a little bit more confidence that your website is safe and so yeah, I think it helps with getting a few extra customers.\nSo, I would I would like to add the trusted site.\nYes.\nAll right.\nHere we go.\nI just went through the check.\nLet's continue here.\nAll right.\nSo, now we are going here inside the website builder.\nSo, we can add our contact info.\nAnd here we are in the website builder.\nNow I went ahead and deleted some of these images here.\nYou get some stock images out of the box.\nI think it can look good in some cases, but I would prefer to only have like real authentic images instead of stock photos.\nUh I think the stock photos may look a little bit fake actually.\nSo I prefer to remove them.\nThey make it very easy to add images here, replace them with the ones that you have.\nBut I like the template still even without the images.\nSo I like the copy here as well.\nSo, of course, the text that you write, the the copy is going to be very important in in how you present yourself and the type of style that you're going for, the type of customers that you want.\nWe could manually write everything, but of course, there is AI these days.\nSo, actually, we do get a couple of options here.\nAnd we can also change the style here.\nSo, here we have something that I think can be removed.\nIt's more like an indicator of what we could do.\nSo, I will actually just remove the section.\nSo, page consists of sections and we get a layout here.\nIf you don't like that, you can each section here, you can click on this bricks icon here and you can pick a different design if you prefer that.\nYou can also change the colors, although we can also change the overall theme right here.\nWe can try a new look if we want.\nWe can set the font or change the buttons here as well, the sections here, the layout, the colors.\nUh you can fine-tune that to your liking, but I think it it looks fine.\nI think what's more important for now is that we have the following, right?\nSo now we have domain and website, but I also want to allow people to book appointments on my website.\nNow with this template that I picked, it has an appointments widget here out of the box as well.\nSo that's really nice.\nHowever, you can see that it's offering some services that are not exactly what I want to offer.\nSo there's resume review, a mock interview session is actually also a really good one to offer.\nCareer strategy consultation.\nSo actually it did a good job at guessing what I would offer.\nHowever, I would like to change that myself manually.\nThere is a different section in the GoDaddy dashboard for that.\nSo, let me actually go to appointments here.\nSo, we were looking at the website section here, but there is a dedicated section here for appointments and also calendar services.\nSo, it does warn me here about my website.\nSo, I made some changes.\nSo, whenever you made some changes and you're happy with them, I can go ahead and publish them.\nI will save and publish.\nAll right.\nSo, let's go to our website.\nAnd now we have our updated website.\nOf course, it would be nice to maybe add an image here and there, but this is a good start.\nNow, here we want to have those appointments.\nSo, what we want to do here is if I refresh here, the warning shouldn't be gone.\nSo, here, if I go back to what we just had, we can set up our services.\nAnd we just want to add it manually for now.\nAll right.\nSo, then here we can set up a service that we offer.\nAnd you may actually offer different types of services.\nYou would create those as separate services.\nNow, in my case, I would perhaps have a code review service.\nSo, I would go through their code and maybe we would do it together during a 1-hour session, let's say.\nSo, I could set it up here as an appointment.\nSo, one-on-one training or online consultation.\nHowever, maybe you have a specific one-time event or repeating events.\nSo, if you have something that is on a regular basis, subscription basis, you can go for that.\nBut for me, it should be like a one-off appointment they could make.\nSo, I would call that perhaps code review.\nAnd let's say it takes about an hour.\nI can put it in a category if I want.\nAll right.\nSo here I quickly want to have a description as well.\nI can use AI here.\nSo it should be professional description and let's see our code review.\nYeah, looks good to me.\nSo I will just insert this.\nWe want to show on the website.\nAll right.\nSo then the pricing.\nSo I would do this perhaps for $100 an hour.\nAnd I actually want to require full payment up front.\nWe can have online payments.\nThis is the easiest.\nIf you have an offline service, you may accept payments offline, but even then you may actually want to have them pay upfront or have a deposit.\nOkay.\nLocation is going to be online and or virtual virtual.\nAnd I I'm just going to be the only person, the business owner.\nNow, it's going to be a meeting.\nSo, actually they GoDaddy has an integration here with Zoom.\nSo, if you already have a Zoom account, you can connect it here.\nAnd it's really nice because as the user books the appointment, they can get the Zoom URL as well.\nSo that's very\n\n\nNice.\nHowever, I may use a different service, or I may have some other way.\nUh, I will just uh have a placeholder here for now.\nOkay.\nSo, require customers to book in advance.\nYeah.\nSo here, how much in advance should they book?\nI don't necessarily want to specify that buffer time.\nSo if you want to have a rest, let's say after a session, so that you are automatically uh blocked off, right?\nRescheduling.\nSo really rich set of options we have here.\nI'm going to save, and we can add another if we want, if we have another service.\nBut let's just assume that we're going to have one service here.\nAll right.\nSo then here, if you go through the sections here in the dashboard, they show you the actions at the top.\nActually, I really like that, cuz it's very clear what the most important action is that you should take.\nSo here they suggest that we set up online payments.\nLet's actually quickly take a look.\nSo we can uh have there's go payments.\nWe can work with PayPal here and other options here as well.\nRight.\nSo, we can set up payments here and also some tax options, taxes.\nYeah, there's no way around them.\nSo, if you're selling something, you you don't, you shouldn't forget about uh sales tax.\nSo, depending on where you live and where your customer lives, there are some regulations around this.\nMake sure to consult a tax professional.\nThere are some options here for that as well.\nSo, I have a service set up now for the code review.\nNow, if I go back to the website here, if I scroll down, you can see there's an appointment option here for code reviews.\nSo somebody could come here and think, yes, I want this code review.\nI'm going to book here.\nAnd now they can pick their own desired date and time.\nSo that's really nice.\nLet's just say this one.\nAnd then in the afternoon.\nSo they see these options here.\nAnd then they can actually book, right?\nSo and by the way, we have the trusted site uh badge here.\nSo everything looks safe.\nSo they're going to book.\nThey can go ahead and pay here.\nNow, let me actually just try this.\n$100 is a bit much to try.\nSo if I quickly reduce the price here, I can quickly try.\nUh, let's say a dollar, although actually I can also create a coupon for myself, so we can have a 100% coupon.\nSo let's say a percentage, the the discount will be 100%, and make sure you don't show it to anyone else, cuz they may be able to book for free, YouTube test, right?\nOr make sure the coupon ends uh, you know, in the near term or limits the users, right?\nBut we can create coupons, of course, if you have maybe some kind of holiday season and you want to have some sales uh type of option, we can create coupons for that.\nAll right, let me actually create this.\nAll right, so now I have this coupon code.\nNow I can use that when I book here.\nLet's actually add it.\nYouTube test.\nAnd now it's free, right?\nSo now I don't have to pay anything.\nAll right, I will continue to payments here.\nBut of course, there shouldn't be anything.\nWe can just confirm the booking actually.\nAll right, so there we go.\nThe order has been placed.\nSo now our customers can book appointments with us.\nNow, how does it look on our side?\nWell, now if we go here, we can see our own calendar.\nSo, if I go there, we can see that we have one customer here for this date and this time.\nYeah, if I click on that, I can see the details here.\nSo, really nice actually.\nI can go to my own calendar.\nI can see it in a day format here as well or in month format.\nSo, very nice overview here.\nSo, you can see how easy that was to set up here.\nSuper easy way to add appointments.\nSo if you want to build some kind of coaching or consulting or that type of service, make sure to check out GoDaddy.\nNow there are some other options here as well because maybe we don't want to have uh literally, you know, 9 to 5 every day, we can actually update our own availability here as well.\nSo if you don't want to work on the weekends, let's say, we can just say no, you cannot book on those days.\nThe appointments can start every x uh minutes.\nWe can also block off sometimes.\nSo, if we're not going to be available, let's say on some particular date, we can just block it.\nBy the way, GoDaddy also has an app.\nSo, if you want to see this on the go and you want to have your brand as well with GoDaddy Studio, although I am also notified over email, of course.\nSo, here I'm notified by GoDaddy here.\nHey, somebody ordered a code review.\nOkay, you can see it has been paid in full already.\nIt's a really easy way to add these features that we want.\nAnd yeah, I don't know any faster way to get started with some kind of service business.\nSo, if you're doing a service business, make sure to check out GoDaddy.\nNow, what if you're selling a physical product?\nWell, they have the commerce option here as well.\nSo, you can set up your product.\nWith this option, you can set up your whole inventory here.\nYou can connect to other marketplaces.\nYou can use certain marketing tools.\nAnd so, I would have to upgrade here slightly cuz I'm on the premium plan, but it's almost the same price.\nAnd a lot of these things will pay for themselves, by the way.\nSo, for example, the abandoned cart recovery.\nSo, if you have people coming to your website, they add a product to the cart, but they don't pay.\nMaybe they get distracted by something else.\nUh, with abandoned cart recovery, um, you can perhaps send them an email like, \"Hey, you forgot to check out.\nYou forgot these items in your cart.\"\nRight?\nAnd if you get a small percentage of people to actually pay, you will quickly gain back the subscription price you pay here.\nSo, I think it's worth it.\nIf you sell offline, you may also want to have their uh, card reader.\nSo yeah, really powerful option here for physical products as well.\nI would refer you to the website to see the latest pricing.\nSo for email, we want to have something like info at our domain.com, right?\nThis looks professional.\nI don't want to have something like coaching, right?\nSomething like this, right?\nThat looks spammy.\nSo here under email, we can easily set up email as well.\nIt has an integration here with Microsoft email.\nSo if we do that, you can pick your domain.\nSo here it's the byte coaching domain.\nSo we can actually set up multiple emails.\nSo for example, maybe you want to have sales at your domain or uh departments or but let's say we just want to have an individual one.\nSo actually it would maybe be a personal one wesley@bbitgratcoaching.com.\nOkay.\nAnd we can add it to the website here as well.\nI will change it to be like the professional one.\nAnd it allows me to set up Microsoft 365 here.\nI can do all of that here in the dashboard as well.\nRight.\nSo that email would be for example where people could reach me, but maybe we also want to be able to reach people ourselves.\nSo there's also a marketing side to email and also social media.\nActually, ideally we also have a solution for our digital presence that has some digital marketing type of tools in there as well.\nSo actually if we go here under marketing here, we actually have a couple of tools.\nIf we go to the overview here, they will give us the best marketing action that they recommend at that point.\nSo what I like is that they actually automatically are able to generate social media posts.\nYou don't have to create these whole social media posts from scratch yourself.\nMajor relief, right?\nSo they come up with some of the copy for the social media post.\nAnd if you want to change this, you just have to change the settings here.\nSo I want to have something educational in a playful tone and it should be about new code review service launched.\nAll right.\nSo it will generate some copy and I can add images if I want.\nSo this is a nice overview of the activity.\nNow if we go to the individual items here as well.\nSo we have a social link here as well.\nYou can connect your social media profiles here as well.\nSo you can for example directly post from here, get some analytics.\nSo if you have an Instagram account or Facebook or these other ones, you can connect them.\nIn fact, if you don't have an account yet, you can also check if the handle that you want or the basically the name is still available.\nSo that's also an option here.\nYou get some insights here.\nNow, for the actual content, you typically have some kind of content calendar, and it's a lot of work to build all of that yourself.\nSo, here they actually do give you a marketing calendar with a lot of ideas for posts.\nSo, it will help you plan out your content in advance, right?\nSo, here with a monthly overview here, there is a bunch of marketing activities that are suggested here.\nAnd these posts are built for us.\nSo, if I click on that one, you can see it has generated another post here.\nAnd I can schedule it to be posted at some point on a particular platform, right?\nSo I could connect my Instagram account, let's say, and I could schedule it.\nWe can also set up some SEO features here as well.\nSo we can go to the SEO tab here.\nSo SEO basically means making sure our website shows up properly in the search engine results.\nSo let's so Google for example, their AI feature arrow actually helps us out here as well.\nSo they recommend some of the keywords that maybe we want to create content about, maybe blog articles.\nSo we can try ranking for those uh keywords in the search results.\nYou can see they already start adding the keywords to our content.\nThey help with setting up alt text for images and things like meta title and description as well.\nSo basically your technical SEO is taken care of to a large degree here as well.\nI just literally clicked the button and it's going to help us improve the SEO.\nRight?\nSo that's what we can do here as well.\nWe already saw calendar.\nAll right.\nSo here we have email marketing.\nUh, they recommend some action plan.\nSo whenever you go to new tab here, they typically have like the most important actions that you probably want to do here at the top.\nSo here they would recommend starting off with the first email.\nAll right.\nSo here they have already scaffolded actually a pretty decent email here.\nRight?\nLooks nice.\nWe can change the tone.\nMaybe it should be more like something else.\nRight?\nWe can just say what we want it to be about and let AI do the hard work of actually generating the copy.\nAll right.\nAnd there we go.\nSo we can generate the copy here.\nUh, we can add recipients.\nSo who do we want to send it to?\nUh, how do we want to track whether people opened it?\nFor example, uh, we can give some information about ourselves.\nSo when they open up the email, like what what email do they see from who it is from and when do you want to schedule this?\nThat's also nice.\nSo basically an email marketing tool already built into the platform.\nI think that's really powerful.\nYou don't have to glue together a separate tool.\nAll of these tools that we just discussed, they're all available here in the GoDaddy platform.\nNow my website right now does not have a blog.\nSo, if you have a type of business that would benefit a lot from these search engine rankings, I do recommend having some kind of blog where you publish some post.\nIt depends a little bit on how you plan to get customers from a business like this.\nI would probably lean more towards social media.\nSo, I would try to, you know, gain some awareness on social media, but there are many businesses that rely more on that search engine traffic.\nUh, we would first want to add a blog section to the site.\nActually, let me do that.\nOkay.\nSo, I will pick this uh design here.\nIt will automatically insert it here at the bottom.\nLooks nice to me.\nI will just uh publish.\nYes, save and publish.\nAll right, now that is live.\nLet's check it out.\nLet's scroll down all the way here.\nWe have our blog right here.\nNow, let's actually add some post.\nSo, here now if I go to blog, I can create a new post.\nAnd here we go.\nSo, here we have the post editor view.\nSo, I could say something like 10 tips to go to senior level developer faster.\nTip one, let a senior developer review your code.\nRight.\nAnd uh I can add images and I can publish here.\nNow I can go here and it will automatically create the appropriate uh slug as well.\nSo basically the title converted to a URL friendly uh format here.\nIt actually gets its own page on the site including sharing buttons here.\nIf I refresh, you can see we now have a nice list here on the homepage as well.\nRight?\nSo that whole website structure and all the managing of that content, you don't need a separate CMS for that.\nIt's all built in to the GoDaddy platform here.\nOkay, so that's really powerful, I think.\nSo, that is one of the things I like most about GoDaddy.\nIt's a very rich all-in-one platform.\nThey even have the studio app here, which which is like a graphic design type of uh app.\nI can basically build out my like brand kit.\nI can create logos.\nI can create hero banner images.\nBasically, I get a whole designer app here as well.\nSo, really, really powerful.\nAnd actually, for preparing the video, I already had another idea.\nAnd you can see it was already able to generate some logos for me actually.\nSo I actually like them actually.\nThey came out pretty nice.\nIt's a really powerful platform.\nI would say check out GoDaddy.\nWe get all of this in one platform.\nAnd if you don't want to spend days or weeks setting up your your digital presence, you don't have to.\nAs you just in a few minutes, you basically have most of this.\nYou can get started with your business.\nAnd as you go, you can build it out and become more sophisticated.\nBut if you just want to quickly get started, I would say check out the link in the description and sign up and uh go through the platform.\nSo, I'm really excited to see the businesses that you are thinking about.\nIn any case, I hope that this helps you out getting started with them.\nI want to thank GoDaddy for sponsoring the video.\nI want to thank you for watching.\nHave a nice day and I hope to see you in the next one.\nBye.\n",
