  "cleanText": "Hey everyone, in this video I'll walk you through Next.js very fast. If you want more in-depth videos about Next.js, check out the rest of my YouTube channel, but this one is meant as a very fast overview of Next.js. So let's say we want to build a Next.js website, a blog website. So I open up my code editor here. I opened a folder here, but you can see it's currently still empty. Where do we start? Well, I can start here by opening up my terminal. And here we can write `npx create-next-app` and we want to use the latest version. And if you just write it like this, it's going to create a new folder in here. But I don't want that. I just wanted to put all the files directly in here. So I'm going to put a period here. If I press enter here, it's going to ask us some questions. I typically just go with all the default options here. So I'm just going to press enter. All right. So after a few seconds, that is finished. And now I have a very standard Next.js sort of a boilerplate. So let me quickly give you a walk through here. So at the top we have node modules. Then we have public. This is basically your static assets like images or videos perhaps. And then we have the source folder. So this is typically where you will spend most of your time as a developer. This is where you have the actual source code of your app. And then we have typically a bunch of configuration files here for the tools that we use in our project. So for example, it's a TypeScript project. So there are some settings for that. So we're using the Next.js app router, not the pages router. And in here we have some special files. So we have a page file directly in the root of this app folder here, which means this component here is going to be used for the homepage. I'm going to say `npm run dev`. You can see it's using something called turbo pack and it speeds up local development a lot actually. And here we go. This is our next application. I typically start off by actually removing all of this because we want to have our own homepage. Now there is also some default styling here. So in globals.css, but I like to remove this as well and also start from a clean slate. However, we do want to use Tailwind CSS. So, I will still leave this. Then there is a FAF icon. This will be used as the FAF icon. And then we have a layout file here as well. This is the root layout. Here we can specify for example the title. This is what you will see in the tab here as well. So if I change it to my blog, we see my blog. We can have a description here. This may show up in Google search results. Here there is something related to the font. And here we see the actual component. So this looks a bit strange with children here, but basically our pages are going to be in here. So all pages will have the HTML and body surrounding it. So let me actually change the homepage here to something like this. Now we have this and we want to have other pages as well. So how do we do that? Well, we create folder and then we need to use page.tsx again. So this is like a special file name that we need to use here. We can just export another React component. I can call posts page or just page. I can type in /posts and we see this. So let's actually create a header here, but I want to have the same header on each page. So we want to add it to the layout. We want to link to other pages that we have. So there is a link component from Next.js. I can go to /ost and I can go back again. Let's also add a footer here. I will do it in the layout as well because I want it to be the same footer for all pages. So now if I go back here, you can see we have a footer. If I now switch pages, you can see it's only the content in the middle that changes, but the content at the top and at the bottom, the header and footer, they stay the same because it's basically the page that will be swapped out here. It would look a bit cleaner if we would put this in its own React component. And I also added an Image here for the logo. There is a dedicated Image component in Next.js which also comes with some optimizations. And we actually get an issue here in Next.js. If you're linking to a external Image like this where it's hosted on Cloudinary in this case I need to allow it explicitly by going to my next config folder file here. Now if I go back the error is gone. All right. So now this looks a bit cleaner and I style it a little bit better as well. So now we have the following. So if I switch between pages that's where the content of that page will go. But so if we now take a look at the folder structure we have the app folder where you have special files you deal with routing. Technically, we could create our components in here, but I like to separate it out into its own components folder. And typically, I also have a library folder, for example, for utilities and so on. So, let's actually try fetching some data. So, I can go to that posts page. So, all of these components are server components by default in Next.js. And one of the things we can do in there, we can fetch data directly like this. Fetch data from some dummy JSON API. And I can parse it as JSON. And I can log it. Let's actually see what we get. If I want to see the console, I have to open up the terminal because this runs on the server side. So if I open it up now, you can see it has already fetched some data here, some dummy post. So now we can map over that here in the UL. So here you can see now I have all of these posts here. I'm getting data from some third party API. However, I can also get data from my own database. So let me actually set up a database here. So I set up a database and I'm using Prisma as my OM to connect to that. I have other videos on that. Prisma offers the studio option so I can see what's in my database. So I added these two posts. Now I want to use that in my Next.js application. You can see I already did that. In a similar way, you can just use async8 use my OM get the posts and just map over it here. And if we take a look here, we have a link actually for them because this is just their title. If I click on them, I want to see their content. And typically you have a separate page for that. We have slashposts, but now we want something after that. So it should be a folder inside there and here I'm using square brackets because it's going to be a dynamic value in the URL and then in there we will still have page.tsx. Okay. So this page needs to render the individual post content and so it needs to know what is actually in the URL. So in this case there is an ID of one in the URL and in a page component we can hook into that. So we get params as a prop here and then I can grab it from my database and then I can output its content. So if I do that you can see we have the title of that post and then also the content. So these are all server components and that's why I can fetch data like this. This runs only on the server. That's why I can directly interact with my database here. So when would you need a client component? Well if you need to hook into browser events for example. So in that case if we want to add an upvote button here I could add it here. So I could try to add some button here and then here we want to hook into the click event. So on click we want to do something. You cannot do this in a server component. There is no click event in a server component. And I could mark this entire component here as a client component. I can do that with `use client`. If I do that indeed you can see the error disappears. But now everything else on the page is affected by that. So typically what you want to do is you want to refactor that specific part into its own component. And here I can have my upload button component. And I can just mark this specific piece that actually needs it to be a client component. And then in here, well, I can do on click on change hook into all of these events. And I can also use React hooks like use state. You cannot use React hooks in server components either. Right? So here I can just add that component to the page without affecting the rest of the page. This is now working as you would expect. So typically we do want to keep things on the server if it's possible. There are many benefits to that. Fetch data like this. We can keep large dependencies on the server doing some heavy computation. It can be done on the server and then the render result of this that is then sent to the user's browser. So that's why we still see server components. Well, we at least we see the output the render result of a server component here in my browser, but the actual computation to make that happen can be done on the server side, right? But with a client component, it runs in the browser. So the logic, the JavaScript code for that needs to be shipped to the client and that's okay. In this case, it's not a huge problem. So, this is one Next.js app and you have to think both about the client side as well as the server side. So, in the client side, we have client components and on the server side, we have server components, but we have some other things on the server side as well like server actions. So, we've already seen how to get data into the app, how to fetch data, but what about the other corrupt operations like creating, updating, deleting? Well, that is what server actions are for actually your so-called mutations. So the traditional get request is basically going to be done mostly in server components. And then to update data, you can you can use so-called server actions. So let's say we want to be able to create posts as well. So on the posts page, we want to have a form. So previously you would have to do something like onsubmit. However, these days we can use the action attribute and then here I can specify a function that will run on the server side. I can mark that as `userver` and then I can try doing something like this. This looks very strange if you've not seen server actions before. And typically I like to put these functions in their own file as well cuz they are quite like important entities in our code. I will create an actions folder here and in there we'll just have one file. So I can create a function called create post and here I will receive the form data. So I do need to specify the name of this function in place here. So I will just specify a name create post. I need to import it. And now when I fill out the form here, if I say third. Now if I click on create post, it will be sent here as the form data. So here I can grab the title and the content and actually insert it in my database. All without manually setting up some kind of API endpoint like you would have done in the past. If I refresh here, you can see we have a new post in the database. If I refresh, you can see indeed we have our third post here. Now, it's a bit annoying to refresh. In fact, we want this page to be updated when we add a post. We can do refunded path fifth post number five. Now, if I submit this, I didn't even refresh, but you can see I now also get this fifth post here. Here we are creating a post, but you can imagine it would be very similar for editing a post or deleting a post. There are so-called route handlers. So we can still create API endpoint on our server. It's very similar as creating an actual page. So in this case it would be / API. So I create folder API and it would be titles and then not a page but it's going to be a route.ts. So when somebody makes a request to our server with that route get all the titles and we will return that as JSON data. So now if I go to that route you can see we have our JSON data here with all of the post titles. In practice, this is commonly used for web hooks. Maybe somebody made a payment and you're using Stripe. Stripe will notify you with a so-called web hook. So, you can see between the client side and server side, there is this request response cycle. But what if you want to do something when there is an incoming request to the server side before you do any of this, you want to have some other logic first. Well, in that case, we may want to have something called middleware. So, I can create a middleware.ts file in the root of the source folder. And here I can export a function that will get that incoming request. And we may want to do something here like redirect the user or internationalization or some people use it for authentication or maybe logging. In this case, I'm only going to log something to the console. And then we are allowing the request to continue. I can specify on which route that should run. So let's say on /ost. So now if I refresh here, you can see we see middleware is running for slposts. Now when we want to go to production, we want to optimize the app as much as possible. There is a build script here as well. So it's going to check the types and then it's also going to generate static pages. So for SEO, it's good if we can already create HTML out of these pages. So now my app is built. If I want to see how it looks like in production, I can use the other script called start. So in that case, it will be `npm run start`. Okay. So now I have these pages. It should actually feel faster. Now about SEO and static rendering. So for example this page here slashpost we can already generate HTML for this page during this build and we can see that slashposts is indeed a static page. It has been pre-rendered and the same is true for the homepage. But then we also have this individual post page that with the ID in that case when somebody goes here this HTML of this page is not ready to go. It needs to be computed on demand which is going to take a little bit longer. the user will have to wait a little bit before that's finished and also it has to be done for every new user coming as well. So it's very inefficient in this case we can specify to nextjs hey for these particular params please generate a page out of it with generate static params. This is more of an advanced feature. So so now we have a nextjs application and now we want to make it available to the rest of the world on the internet. So we need to deploy next\n\n\nJS, we need to host it somewhere so other people can access it as well.\nSo let me actually show you how to self-host Next.js with Coolify on a VPS.\nI'm going to use Hostinger for that.\nThey are also today's sponsor and one of the reasons I like them is that they already offer a Coolify VPS template out of the box.\nSo, I think that's a major plus for Hostinger.\nIf I scroll down a little bit here to the plans, I'm going to use the KVM2 plan.\nI had a good I had a great time using this actually so far.\nThese are the resources that we get with that.\nIf you anticipate that you're going to need more of that, you may want to go for a bigger plan here.\nHowever, I will just go with the KVM2 plan.\nYou can find a link in the description, by the way, if you want to sign up.\nIf I choose this plan right now, when you pay for this, make sure to use my coupon code, which is all uppercase byte grad to get a discount.\nAnd so you can get a great price here for your VPS.\nThen if we scroll down a little bit here, you can pick a location, but here we can pick the operating system.\nSo here is where I'm going to use Coolify because they make self-hosting actually so much easier.\nAnd I will pay.\nAll right.\nSo after payment, there is a setup wizard here.\nSo let me walk you through it.\nHere you need to set up a password here that you may need to use to access the VPS.\nAlthough we don't need to use it with just Coolify, but it's still good to remember this.\nSo, make sure you pick one that you remember.\nI will finish the setup here.\nAll right.\nSo, then it's going to set up my VPS.\nSo, I will get back to you when it's finished.\nAll right.\nSo, now my VPS is finished.\nWe can go to manage VPS here.\nAnd here is the Hostinger dashboard.\nSo, we can manage all sorts of settings about our VPS.\nBut since we picked the Coolify template, we can actually just go to that panel right here.\nAnd so here we can set up our Coolify account.\nSo here in Coolify, it's organized in so-called projects.\nWe can have a private repo on GitHub here for our Next.js app and then link that here with Coolify.\nSo let's actually make sure that we push our app to GitHub first.\nSince we're not going to use a database in this example, I will remove my database here.\nAll right.\nSo I will just call this my blog.\nI'm going to make it private and I will create the repo here.\nSo I will first stage all of the changes.\nJust paste all of this in one go.\nMy app is here on GitHub.\nOkay.\nSo now I can combine that here with fully.\nSo I can do private repo here.\nWe're going to add a GitHub app.\nSo we need to register here.\nBut we do have to create a GitHub app here.\nOkay.\nAnd I need to install the repos.\nI will pick the my blog.\nOkay.\nInstall.\nAll right.\nSo then we have the GitHub app.\nUh let me actually just save here.\nNow I can go back to projects here my project and now we can actually add a resource.\nIt's going to be a private repo.\nWe can pick the GitHub app that is relevant for that.\nSo let's create the application here and we click on deploy.\nSo we just have to wait a couple of seconds and at some point it will be finished.\nSo actually if we go to the configuration of that deployment a domain has been created for us as well.\nIf I go there, you can see that we now have our Next.js application running on the VPS all managed here with Coolify.\nCoolify is running on our VPS here hosted by Hostinger.\nIf you have a domain, we can also set that up.\nSo actually Hostinger also offers domains.\nI have a domain here.\nI can add an A record.\nSo I can see that right here.\nI can specify like this and update the record.\nNow I can go here to Coolify.\nI can go back to my configuration here.\nAnd here under domains, I can now use that one with https.\nSo it's going to be viterrcourses.com.\nI'll press enter here.\nBut it does need to redeploy as you can see.\nRight.\nSo here, if I want to redeploy the app, it's just one button click.\nBoom.\nAll right.\nSo when that is finished, I can copy that.\nI can go to my actual domain that I want to use.\nAnd here we go.\nHere is my application.\nAnd it's using HTTPS.\nSo now I have a very smooth deployment process here for self-hosting.\nThis was this was much more difficult before but yeah thanks to uh Coolify and also of course Hostinger with their Coolifi template this is actually a very smooth experience.\nSo I would say check out Hostinger with the Coolifi template.\nI will link it down below.\nSo I hope you have a better idea now of Nex.js.\nThis was a very quick video a lot of other videos if you want more in-depth content.\nIn any case thanks to Hostinger for sponsoring the video and thank you for watching.\nI hope to see you in the next one.\nBye.\n",
