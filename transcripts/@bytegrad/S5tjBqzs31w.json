  "cleanText": "Let's talk about some of these terms that you hear all the time, but you may not completely understand them. So these are CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR, PPR. This is actually a bit of a new one. It's coming along very nicely in Next.js. Let's actually try to understand what they all mean, how it is practically used because they are actually pretty core features in a Next.js application. So let's actually start from the left here. All right. So to understand this, you do need to understand a little bit about how a Next.js app is structured. So we have a client side as well as a server side, and on the client side we have React client components, and on the server side we have React server components. These days we also have server actions, basically your traditional post, put, and delete requests. If you want to update data, that's why you have server actions, but we can still create API endpoints as well with these so-called route handlers. So if you want to have an API endpoint on your server, we can use that, for example, for web hooks. All right. So let's talk about these terms. So let's start from the left there. So CSR is client side rendering. And what do people mean when they say that? Well, it typically means that the app is rendered in the client side. So this is traditionally how you would learn React and how you would build React applications. React would run only in the client side, only in the browser. Now what does that mean? Well, let's say I have some blog. So, here I have a homepage. I have a /post page. And here I have the individual post page. So, title and some content here. So, technically it is possible to compute all of the markup for this on the client. That is actually traditionally if you were using React to build this blog app, everything would be rendered as it's called client side. For example, if I want to add an upvote button here, I could have an upvote component for that and it could have some state, right? Keeping track of how many times an article was upvoted. And here we have a button, some markup here. And then here we are rendering that count into the markup. So with client side rendering, this is rendered in the user's browser, right? So with rendering I mean the statements inside the component function body are run to compute a final output here of the markup. Right? So initially the result of that render would be something like this. And this is just one component, but in a React app that would be the case for all the components. All the components would be would run only in the user's browser. And actually if you're just learning React, that is probably still how you learn it. Okay. So this is like the traditional way of rendering, you could say. And then came along Next.js. And with Next.js these days, we actually suddenly have a lot of server side functionality. So actually a lot of components in your app will not run in the browser. They will actually only run on the server side. So here we have server side rendering. So here you can imagine a React component. It's being rendered on the server side. So if we take a look at an example of a server component in this app, for example, this list of post, this is also React component, and if this is rendered, meaning all the statements inside the React component function body are run only on the server side. So this does not run in the browser. So we get the output of that computation on the server side, right? This does not run in the user's browser, and actually that has some advantages. So for example, I can fetch data directly inside the function body here. I don't I don't need some use effect. I can just do it directly here. I can use my OM Prisma here because it's all in a server environment. In the user's browser, we are typically not using Prisma, right? So we can do this on the server side thanks to this being a server component that runs only on the server. In a next application, very often most of the components are actually server components. If we take a look at a page component, for example, this is also a React component. We just call it home and it's sitting in a file called page, but still a React component, and by default actually these are server components. So they run only on the server, right? So actually a lot of components by default are server components. So a lot of things by default are rendered on the server, and the output of that render is sent to the client, right? So we that's why we can still see it, and that's why I can still see a list of posts here. If I go here, the output of that of that render is still sent to me as the user here. So I can still see it. So in an XJS app, like I just said, essentially the components are server components by default. So then how does it work with like an upvote button? An upote button needs to hook into the click event, right? So when the user clicks a button like we just saw, this component here, when I click the button, I want to increase that upvote count, right? So here I need to hook into an event in the browser. These events do not run on the server. There's no click event on the server. Also, these React hooks cannot be used on the server side. We can only use them here in the browser. So, how does that fit in the Next.js app? We can still use components like this in a next.js app, of course. We just have to make sure those are client component. And I can do that by adding use client at the top. If I now add it to the page, if I go to an individual blog post, you can see you can see this works. And so what happens is that the page component here is a server component. In there we have other things that may be server components, but you can still have like little islands of interactivity that are client components. So those components run in the browser and those server components run only on the server, right? And typically there are some advantages of keeping things on the server side. So it makes sense that that's the default, and typically we only want to convert it into a client component if it's actually necessary. So if you actually need to hook into browser events like a click event or a change event or you want to use React hooks like use state or use effect, but in many applications, especially if it's more like a static application like this a blog website where it's typically not super interactive, people are just reading essentially, so there are not really many browser events like clicks, it's just reading, in that case, you will have a lot of server components and and relatively few client component, however in a highly interactive application like a dashboard where the user is analyzing izing a bunch of analytics and clicking filters. In that case, you have a lot of browser events and you want to hook into like those click events. So, you have a lot of client components. In fact, a big chunk of the app is going to be running client side. So, if you want a Next.js app can still have a lot of client side rendering very much like a traditional React app like we had in the years past, right? You just have to make sure it has used client or you can also use a so-called dynamic import. So, there are ways to make sure that a component runs in the client. All right. So how I just explained it, server side rendering and client side rendering, I basically focused it around a specific component, but very often people are not really talking about an individual component. People are talking about a whole page. So this is the slashposts page. This is the posts page. So this posts page basically just lists the titles of the posts. So here I have the relevant page component for that. It's just a React component and I have a div here. I have an H1 and I have a list here coming from that React component that we just looked that we just took a look at. Right? So that's this component here. It doesn't really matter if I structure it like this with with this u with this list in a separate component or if I would just literally put everything here inside this page component. It doesn't really matter. Let me just move it here just to prove that. Right. So now I moved everything over from that dedicated component actually just onto the page and we get the exact same result. So it doesn't it doesn't matter how you structure that. I can actually delete that component now. We don't need it anymore and it would work the exact same. This does not make a difference. It's basically just how we want to structure it as Developers. This is still a server component. This is still running only on the server side. So the next term here that you will hear a lot is SSG. So SSG is static site generation. When somebody goes to this posts page, right? If I go there, right? I press enter here, I go to this page. Now what happens here is there is some incoming request from the users browser to our Next.js server side, right? For the /posts page, what's going to happen is so this page needs to be rendered. And as we just discussed, this is a React server component by default. The computation for rendering that page happens on the server side and then it's returned to the user, right? So eventually we get the result of this page. Okay. Now we can add an optimization here so that if somebody goes to this page, we don't have to compute it on demand, right? On the we can actually already during a build compute this, basically render this component during the build once and then it will give us a result, and so then when somebody goes to that page, we already have the result waiting for them. The result is already ready to go. So no matter how many people come here, we do not have to render this over and over again. We just have to render it once and then when somebody goes here, we just serve that one result over and over again. That would be much more efficient, much faster, and it makes sense to do that because the posts in my database here, they have not changed, right? In a short amount of time, they're going to be the same for let's say a long time, so if I just rendered this page and it shows me seven posts, if 1 second later somebody goes to this page as well, I do not have to render it all over again, it's too it's too wasteful, right? Because the number of posts isn't going to change in 1 second. So it makes sense that we just compute it once and then just serve it over and over again. And actually that is the default. So if I run a build here of my app, I can check that with npm run build. There is another way to check that by the way with this new widget here in the corner. It will tell you if a route, it should tell you if a route is static, right? So static means rendered once and then served over and over. This is what we would want. If we can if we can do that, that would be great. The alternative is dynamic, right? So this page, this post page is static, meaning it will be pre-rendered during the build time. Okay. The alternative is dynamically rendered. So in that case when somebody goes here, it will be it will be rendered on demand. So on the fly. So all of the statements inside this body would run again and a new a new result has to be computed. And then if one second later somebody else comes to this page, we we also we have to do that all over again. And then then if if half a second later somebody else comes, we also have to compute the entire result again. So this is dynamic rendering, right? This is way more resource intensive and it will take longer from a user's perspective. So if we can, we want to have our route to be statically rendered. So then during a build, let me actually show you that if I run a build now, we can already compute the result of this, right? So what we could get is just one HTML file. That's how you can think of it. We get one HTML file for that slashposts page and we can just serve that over and over again. So here if you run a build in Next.js, it will actually give you some useful output here at the bottom. It will give you an overview here for each route that you have and it will tell you if it's if that if that's static or dynamic. So you can see the homepage, well, it's static. So basically the HTML of the homepage is now already computed. If somebody goes to the homepage, we can just quickly serve the HTML page. We do not have to render it at that point. We already have it. We've already done that. Same for SLP post, right? I can already run this computation here right now. Already get the HTML. Now, if somebody comes here, we already have it ready to go. Can be served super fast. We don't have to render anything. Next person comes along 1 second later, we sent the exact same file over. It's already finished. It's already ready to go. Right? So, that is SSG, static site generation. We want our pages to be static if it's possible. So it makes sense that that actually that is the default. So by default the pages that you create will be statically generated during a build. However, you can see that we also have another one that is actually not static. This is a dynamic one. So meaning as there is an incoming request the server side, right? So this this page here, this is a server component. Let's actually go there. That's the posts for the the page for the individual post. As there is an incoming request for a in an individual blog post, this component has to be rendered at that point, at at that point, right? On the fly, on demand, during runtime, Next.js has not created the HTML of this page during the build. So if I go to this first blog post, refresh here, when I go here, refresh or I just press enter to get the result here, it has to run all of the statements inside here and compute the final output here and send it back to me, and then 1 second later somebody else comes and has to do that all over again, even though of course in that 1 second nothing has changed about that blog post, the title and content are just the same. So we have to do a lot of new computation every time somebody goes here, right? Which is not really efficient because well, it's not necessary. This blog post is still going to be the same 1 second later. Why has Next.js not kept this static? Why was this dynamic in that build output we just saw? Well, that is because here we are doing something special. So here we are actually hooking into params here. And based on the params, right? So basically based on the ID here in the URL, that's what we're getting here. We're going to get the blog post from our database. So if I go to the other one second, there is number two in the params, right? So we get an id of two here. So we grab the params, we grab the id, and based on that, we can get the relevant post from the database. So now this params could be anything, right? Could be\n\n\nTwo could be, uh, you know, some random number could be another random number could be literally an infinite amount of combinations. So, Next.js is, of course, not able to generate this as a static page because it doesn't know what the params are going to be, right? This params could literally be anything. This depends on runtime information. So, as there is an incoming request, so if I go here now, now there is an actual two in the param, right? So now I know it's going to be two, and now I can generate the post now, and now I can generate the page. So, by default, actually, a page is statically rendered, which is what we want if we can do it, unless you are using some kind of feature that depends on the runtime information, right? So, it cannot generate it statically if it depends on something on some information that it will only receive as the user is making a request, right? So, in this case, we have basically something in the URL that we need to know in order to render this. We need to know which particular ID the user wants to see, right? So, we have params here. There's also search params. So, if you use this, you will also turn your page into a dynamic, dynamically rendered page, right? So, this is when you have something like, uh, question mark, question mark, uh, page is one, right? So, if you add something like this, and then you are hooking into that with the search params prop here in the page component, it's also going to be dynamically rendered, and the same is true if you use cookies or headers, right? So, if you are going to render something here or do something here depending on the cookies that the user has or the headers of the incoming request, well, yeah, cookies, I don't know during the build what the cookies are that the user can have, right? So, Next.js cannot compute this during build time because it doesn't know yet what the cookies or headers are going to be that the user may have, that many different users may have. So, this also depends on runtime information. So, if Next.js detects during the build that you are using these functions, it will also not statically generate this. It will actually turn it into a dynamically rendered page as well. This is mostly relevant, by the way, if you use authentication. If you use authentication, very often the user will have some kind of, let's say, JSON web token in their cookies. So, you're going to check if the user has a valid access token, a valid access, uh, JSON web token in their cookies. So, you may be using the cookies function for that. And if you're using a third-party authentication solution, in that case, the third party is going to use cookies for you under the hood when you use one of their solutions, right? And that they kind of, and they have to do that because they have to read the incoming cookies to check if the user has a valid access token, let's say. So, you do want to be a little bit careful with where you do the authentication check. This may actually be an argument for doing the authentication check in middleware. If you do it in middleware, the page can perhaps stay statically rendered, right? So, as I'm making the request during runtime here, Next.js knows how to render this page. But during the build time, yeah, it, it doesn't know yet what the people are going to have, what, what the people are going to, well, IDs are going to be in the URL. So, that's why this page has become dynamic. And actually, sometimes people will say that that page is server-side rendered, meaning it's basically being rendered on demand. But actually, I find it a bit confusing. I think it's better to refer to SSG. So, a static page or a dynamic page. So, a static page is already rendered during the build. A dynamic page is going to be computed on demand, right? On the fly during runtime. This is less efficient because it has to be rendered as I'm going here, right? So, I have to wait a little bit longer because the page has to render at that point as I'm going here. So, is there maybe some way to also use SSG for a page like this? So, yes, actually. So, here in Next.js, I can export a function called generateStaticParams. Remember, the reason that Next.js cannot make this static during the build is because this params could literally be anything, right? It could be any number here. What if it knew the actual numbers it could be? In that case, it can just generate those pages, right? So, if we, if we tell it, well, it could be number one and number two and number three, let's say there are three numbers, well, then it can generate three pages, right? One for each. So, that is what we can do here. So, here actually, if I wanted to do it for all my posts in my database, I can get all the posts, and what do I need to return from here? Well, I just, I just need to return that number and the ID in that case. So, in that case, I'm giving it all the IDs that it could be, and so it can generate a static page for, for each ID. So, now if I run this build again, npm run build, you can see here generating static pages. Now there are actually more. And now if we take a look, you can see that now we have something else going on here. You can see that here we have SSG pre-rendered as static HTML using generateStaticParams with the pages that we specified here with the param. Um, now we also have SSG for route that has a more, well, dynamic parameter in there. Actually, we can still have SSG. We can still have that pre-rendering, that SSG for those pages as well with using this function. Now, by the way, we just saw that make the individual blog post, uh, statically rendered, which means during the build, it's run on the server side, and then the result of that will be served over and over again, right? It's cached. That's optimal. That's what we want if we can do it. Now on the individual blog post, we saw that we have this upload button, which is actually a client component. So, how is it possible that, um, that actually works perfectly fine because a client component runs in the browser, right? And the static generation happens on the server side. So, how is that, how is that possible? Well, so how, so how's it possible that we have a client component on that page, and how's, how does that work? Well, actually, a client component also runs on the server side. This is a little bit confusing. So, a client component during that static generation actually is computed on the server side as well, right? We have to because it's part of this page. So, if we want a whole page, if you want to create, let's say, the HTML out of the whole page, yeah, of course, we also need to render a client component on there. So, a client component is still run on the server side as well initially once, right? And after that, it's run on the client side. So, this is a little bit confusing, but a client component basically runs in two, both on the client side as well as server side, but only once on the server during that, uh, static generation. A server component only runs on the server side. So, it never runs in the client side, right? It's only computed on the server side, right? So, that's a little bit confusing, but it makes sense when you think about it. All right? So, a little bit complex. Hope you're still with me. All right. I'm going to show you something really cool. So, make sure you watch all the way to the end. But before I continue, I quickly want to show you ImageKit. They are also today's sponsor. So, I know a lot of you are building apps and websites, and you will need to upload images and videos at some point, and you want to deliver those media assets in an optimized manner as well, and you also want to be able to manage those assets easily as well. So, that's what you can use ImageKit for. I've actually enjoyed working with them in the past as well. They have a very easy platform to upload my assets and manipulate them, deliver them in an optimized manner. So, what I can do, for example, is here in the dashboard or also programmatically through their API, I can upload the asset. So, if I have an image on my website, for example, I can add that here. I can actually upload it from different sources, not only my own computer, also these other sources where you already may have your asset. You may actually also want to get them from external storage. So, if you already have something there, you can just connect that. No problem. But let's say I actually upload an image here. So, this is the image I want to upload here. If I upload this one, uh, super fast, and now it's uploaded. So, then here it's going to be placed in my media library. So, here I can manage all of my assets. I can, uh, click on that, and I can tag them, for example, or I can add metadata. I can do other things here. Basically, manage all of these assets, and actually, now it also allows me to remove the backgrounds here with a button in the dashboard as well. Very neat. But of course, at some point, we actually want to display it in our website or web app. And so, I need some kind of URL. I can copy that from here. And now I can add that to my website. Let's say, right? So, here I have my image, and this has actually automatically been optimized for me. So, if I check out the network tab and I load the page here, what are we actually loading here? I actually uploaded a PNG image. But now you can see the content type is actually webp, which is an optimized format. So, I like seeing that. And you can see it's also been placed on a CDN for me. This image is now being delivered in an optimized manner, and I don't even have to do much. I can actually decide here in the settings if I want to change that. So, here under settings, images, I can decide how it should be optimized. So, because I toggled this on, it will actually use WEBP, for example. It may actually optimize the image quality even further. The default quality is 80, but we can change that if we want. And we have a lot of other options here as well, including signed URLs for some additional security. Now, this has an image, but of course, it works very similarly for videos. So, with videos, it's even more important because these can be huge files. So, that you optimize them is even more important. So, here you can specify the video codec. So, this option, it will actually pick the for me. So, that's really nice as well. The video quality can be changed as well, right? So, a lot of options here in the dashboard. But what I actually also want to show you is that we can transform this image further. Your users will go to your website and web apps on different devices with different internet speed. If we only have one, uh, big image essentially, that's not going to be optimal because on a mobile phone, I don't need to load such a big image. I can load a smaller image. So, we can optimize it even further by creating essentially derivative versions of this image or video if you have video. And actually, it's super easy to do because you just change the URL. Actually, as of recording, they just add as AI transformations here, particularly removing the background. So, this has now been made cheaper by ImageKit. We can remove the background, but we can also change the actual size of the image, actual dimensions. Very important for different devices. So, we do that by just changing the URL. So, I can add something here like TR for transform, and I can say the width if the user is on mobile phone. Let's say on that device, I'm going to load this image with this URL. And so, if I press enter here, you can see ImageKit has created a new image essentially with that particular width. And we can do the same for height if we want. I can also say that no, the height should be, uh, 400, let's say. Of course, I can combine them as well and have multiple transformations in the same URL. So, we can resize images. We can, we can also crop them. So, if you want to remove something, we can also crop to a face. For example, if you want to crop, if you want to remove the things outside the face, let's say, there's object-aware cropping. So, it's pretty sophisticated. We can add overlays as well. So, if you want to add something to an image, maybe a watermark, let's say. But, of course, these days we live in the age of AI. So, ImageKit also has these AI transformations. It's not only background removal, also generative fill. So, if you want to add something to an image, upscale it, or even generate an image via text prompt is possible as well. There are effects as well. So, blur, uh, flip, etc. And a lot of those transformations are possible for videos as well. We can create video thumbnails, we can trim the videos, and I actually also did a video with ImageKit on on adaptive bit rate streaming. So, if you want to see how to set all of this up from scratch step by step, make sure to check out the other videos I did with ImageKit. They have a good guide here on how to optimize the images as well, by the way. So, check out the documentation here for how to optimize images and videos, and they'll show you exactly what to do. Squeeze out as much as you can. And overall, I had a great time working with ImageKit. I think it's a great product. So, I would say check them out. You can find a link in the description. In any case, I want to thank ImageKit for sponsoring the video. And now, let's get back to the video. All right. So, what about this ISR? It has to do with SSG, actually. So, as I just explained, if we have this posts page, we can already create the HTML out of this, you could say during the build, right? So, if I'm going here to this page, we don't have to compute it on demand, right? So, if I'm a user and I go to this page, we already have the HTML for this page ready to go. And then a second later, somebody else comes, we have, we already have the HTML ready to go. We do not commute, we do not, we don't have to compute anything during runtime. It's already static, which is optimal. This is what we want, actually. Now, what happens if the posts actually do change, right? So, if I go here and there are seven posts, my editor just published a new post. So, now 10 seconds later, somebody else comes here as well. In that case, if we only show seven posts, well, now it's outdated, right? So, now we need, we need a way to update it, basically. So, this is where we get into the realm of ISR, right? Incremental static regeneration.\nIf I, uh, just publish a new post, let me actually add a form here to the page and do that, right? So, currently we have seven posts. If I go look in my database, we indeed have seven posts, right? So, if we now run a build, it's going to generate static HTML out of this. And so, there's going to be seven posts displayed on here. So, whenever somebody would go here now, they would see seven posts. What happens if I\n\n\nAdd a new post here, the eighth one? I could manually add one here. I can actually also do it in here with a so-called server action. So, let me actually just do it here. Eight. This is post number eight. Okay. So, I'm going to click on create post. And you can see the data here is gone. Um, but if I refresh here in my database, you can see I now have eight posts in my database. Okay. But remember the HTML of this page is still the same. So, if somebody would go here, they would still get only seven posts. So now this page is out of date. We need to basically give some kind of signal to uh Next.js to re-trigger that generation of that static page, right? That's why it's called incremental static regeneration, right? So this page basically needs to be regenerated. So we can signal to Next.js that it needs to uh regenerate that. So there is the revalidate function, revalidate path in this case from next cache, but there is also revalidate tag. So I can tell Next.js, hey, this /ost page is basically out of date. We need to revalidate it. So here I'm using it in a so-called server action. This create post is a so-called server action. And this is basically how we can update data in Next.js very conveniently. We don't have to set up a separate API end point. It's all handled for us under the hood. The data of the form will be sent to our server side. Here we can grab the title and content and create the post in our database. However, at that point, Next.js does not know yet that that posts page needs to be regenerated. It needs to get fresh data. So, actually in the same request response cycle, we can immediately also give Next.js a signal. Hey, this /ost page is basically out of date. It needs to get fresh data. So it will actually regenerate that post page in the same uh cycle. So now actually you can see I'm already seeing the eighth post here. But actually the cool thing is if I do it now ninth post number nine. If I press create post here you can see it also updates my UI in the same request response cycle. So it gets added to the database and then also it returns the updated page and the updated page will then also be cached again. So this is actually one of my favorite features about Next.js. I think it's very powerful and it it doesn't require us to run another build of the whole app, right? So, it's incremental. We just regenerate the part that has changed.\n\nAll right. So, then we arrive here with PPR, which is actually a new one. And I'm actually really excited about this one because uh we can take the optimization that we just discussed even further. So, this stands for partial pre-rendering. If we go back to what we just discussed with SSG, what I can do on a page is I can generate it during the build, right? So here if we have the posts page, I can uh during I can do a Next.js build and during the build, it will already create the HTML or the render output. It can be put on a CDN, let's say, and then every time somebody goes here, it's already ready to go. Nothing has to be rendered on demand. It's already rendered once during the build. It's a static page, right? This is optimal. This is the default. This is what we want if it's possible. Now remember, if you use something that depends on runtime information, you're going to opt out of that static rendering for that page. So, as we saw before, if you use um something from search params, so let's say or cookies or headers. Yeah. So, during the build, we don't know yet what the cookies are going to be or we don't know that we don't or we don't know yet what the what the params are going to be. So, or what the search params are going to be. So if you use a feature like that, Next.js will automatically turn it into a dynamically rendered route and that will actually be for the whole page. So if you only have one little island essentially that is using that, you're going to affect the whole page with that. Right? So here for example, let's say the user goes to the first page. I want to perhaps store that in their cookies. Let's say that they went to the first page. So then later when they come back, I can show them the the posts that they viewed, right? So in this case I can have a component like this and this component is going to look at the incoming cookies of the user and we're going to check for the information in there a recently viewed post right it would be something like this and in this case if I include this on the page so now I have included this here on the page if I now run a build npm run build before this was actually a statically rendered page right we can already run it once and now if we run a build you can see that /post is not static any is not static anymore. It's actually now a dynamic route. It's server rendered on demand. So now whenever somebody goes here all of this has to be rendered again and again over and over again. If we may actually have a lot of computationheavy things going on on the page and we have to run that over and over again simply because one little piece here is using something that is dependent on runtime information. Can we fix this? Well, actually, yes, we can thanks to partial pre-rendering actually. So, as of recording, I do need to enable this in my app. So, it's still experimental as of recording. But if I do this now, I can mark I can tell Next.js, hey, everything should be static except for this little piece here. So, I do need to uh create a soal I do need to create like a boundary around this, right? So, here I can use suspense actually. Okay, so basically with suspense now I'm telling Next.js, hey this part is dynamic but everything here can stay static. You can already generate this once during the build. Everything here except for this little part here. This part is dynamic, right? So we can already create like a static shell and then for the actual dynamic part we can confine that better and isolate that better from the rest of the page. So if I go back now, so actually as we're recording I do need to use the canary build for Next.js. Now if I go back here, you can see this still works. And now if I run a build, what we want is that as much as possible is static and only this piece which depends on runtime information is dynamic. So now if I run this build here, all right, generating static pages, I actually do see the same output as before. I think it's just because it's very experimental and it's on the canary version. So I think it just doesn't there's just no visual output indicator for that yet. But the idea here is that this can become static and this can stay dynamic. So this is basically uh optimal, right? So in documentation they have some nice graphics here as well. So you can see on one page you can have a lot of static things like a navbar right or product information. This doesn't change that often. We can just generate this once during the build. But some things really depend on the user right so what they have in their cart perhaps right this is something that we don't know during the build. Same with recommended products. This may also depend on the user. We don't know yet during the build what it's going to be. So, right, so we can mix that in an optimal manner with partial pre-rendering. So, I think that's pretty exciting to uh to see. So, hopefully now you have a better idea of all of these terms, right? So, as you can see, Next.js has a really powerful framework and it's exciting to see that it keeps getting better and better. So, thanks to ImageKit for sponsoring the video and thank you for watching. Hopefully, you find it helpful. Have a nice day and I hope to see you the next one. Bye.\n",
