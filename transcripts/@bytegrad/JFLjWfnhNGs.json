  "cleanText": "Hey everyone, let's talk a little bit about automating our tasks as developers by using the new GitHub MCP server. So, you may have seen it around or maybe not, but I've been playing around with it and I'm actually pretty impressed. There are some things that I can do now with my AI agent, which is much easier than how I did it before and manually clicking in the UI myself. Now, an AI agent can do certain things on behalf of me. And this can actually simplify some parts of your daily workflow. I will show you how to set it up. But before we get there, let's actually just quickly see what we can do. Some of the things that we can do here. So I have installed the MCP server. I've set it up and I will show you that as well. But let me first show you what I can do now. So I will need some kind of AI agent that can do things on behalf of me. So you need some kind of application that also supports MCP. So I've been using GitHub Copilot, actually, but there are other ones as well. Anthropic has one. Now here in GitHub Copilot, I picked the agent mode. So, actually here with GitHub Copilot, I can click on here and I can see the MCP servers that my agent can reach out to. If I scroll down a little bit, we have the—we actually have one that I showed you in another video. This is the MCP server that I created myself. Check out that other video if you want to see how to create an MCP server in your Next.js application. But this is the one that I installed from GitHub.\n\nNow, an MCP server will contribute certain tools. These are the tools that the agent can invoke. So, for example, if I tell the agent to create a new issue, it may decide to invoke this tool, which is exactly this—right, open a new issue—and it can do other things as well, like open a new pull request, create a new repo, and it may actually do multiple in the same request; actually, it's pretty common. You can also get details about your commit, details about the issues, the comments. Also, it can decide to get more information about you, right? So, if you say something like \"get all the issues assigned to me,\" so it needs to know perhaps a little bit about who you are. There's actually a dedicated tool for that: \"Get me.\" There are many other tools here. Well, I believe there are more than 50, actually. So, it's pretty comprehensive and it actually seems to work really well. These are the tools that my agent can invoke on behalf of me. So, I could say something like, \"Could you list the open GitHub issues?\" And I can even say \"by priority,\" let's say. So I want to see the open GitHub issues. I'm starting my day. I want to know what I need to work on. And it's in agent mode here. And I'm using the Claude sonet 4 model. It's considered a very good model as of recording. And let's just see what happens. I'm going to press Enter here. And let's see what it's going to do. So here you can see it starts to type. And here you can see it's invoking a tool. So this is how it shows in the Copilot interface here. And it has actually invoked another tool here. So now it has called two tools and another one, a third one. Okay. So it actually may invoke these tools multiple times, and you can see now it's actually a different tool. This was \"list issues,\" and this is the tool \"get issue detail.\" Well, it had about six different tool invocations here and ultimately now it can come up with a result. It has automatically ranked these in terms of priority. So, high priority, we have some issues here for the—for my React and Next.js course. Make sure you check it out as well, by the way—amazing course. These are not big issues. No worries. Um, we have some other issues here as well. And then we have medium priority. So these are some smaller issues and lower priority as well. So pretty nice summary by repository. That's also very nice. And with some recommendations, but it was able to generate this response because it was able to retrieve this information from my GitHub account, right? So if we scroll up a little bit to see what it exactly did. So it actually invoked this \"list notifications\" tool, and you can give that tool an input. So it actually just gave this one, and it—what it got back from that GitHub MCP server was this output, right? So then my agent could use that output to continue finishing the request here. So it was basically just checking my notifications, and from the notifications it's going to get the open issue. So it says, \"I can see several repositories with issues. So let me check the issues for each repo systematically.\" It ran \"list issues,\" pass this as the input. So basically it's going to ask for a specific repository to give the specific issues in the open state. So the LLM came up with this as the input, right? So in LLM, the agents—the Claude—for in this case decided that it—that this needs to be the input to call the tool, and what it got back from the GitHub MCP server is this, which is going to be a list of open issues for this repo, right? So then it called the same tool but now with different inputs. So now also for the other courses, right? So now you can see it had some other repos as well to also get the issues, and then it had a different tool to get issue details. So of a particular issue, you can also get the particular details for this repo. \"Give me the details about issue with number 14.\" And so then the LLM got back this response from the GitHub MCP server, right? So then ultimately it has retrieved all the information and it can synthesize this output here. That's basically how it works in a nutshell. There are many other things we can do. For example, I can say, \"Summarize changes in the to-do app repo,\" right? Maybe I want to see the changes that were made in that repo. And I can use one of these other models as well, right? So if I try GPT 4.1, what they're basically doing is tool calling. So they need to be able to identify when to call a tool with which inputs and how to deal with the output. Uh, but let's try it out with GPT 4.1.\n\n\nSo, summarize changes in the to-do app repo. You can see it has already invoked the tool here, and it basically ran the list commits tool. So, basically, it's going to retrieve a list of commits for this particular repo. It got back a list of commits, and I get a nice output here that shows me the changes that were made to the repo.\n\nOkay, really nice. I can also try to do something like, \"Can you close all issues older than 30 days in the to-do app repo?\" So this is more like a write action. Previously, we were doing some reading of data. So, first, it's going to get the issues, and now it will try to edit an issue. Okay. So now it will actually ask me—well, it depends on the application you're using, but here in GitHub Copilot, it will ask me for permission. So I do have to confirm that I want to allow edit issue, and then it wants to do it for another issue as well. I will allow this, and you can see now it has closed these issues, right? So it can also do these sort of write operations as well. I don't have to manually approve each tool usage. I can also allow them to be automatically approved. But I'm still a little bit careful with this because, yeah, all of this is very new. I don't want to have something destructive without my permission right now. But I think over time a lot of these things can be done automatically.\n\nSo, if you want to know what you can do, I would say just look at the tools that the agents can invoke; it will give you some pretty good ideas. So one other thing could be, for example, \"Can you create a new repo called GitHub MCP and commit the first commit readme hello world?\" Right, just something silly here, just to try it out. Let me actually just see—let's actually see what happens and if this is possible. All right, so now it wants to run a tool called create repository. Yeah, so here, for example, I can actually also allow in this session, allow in this workspace, or always allow. Let's actually just allow it in this session so I don't have to confirm every little thing. Now this is a tool. So this is creating a file. So I will also allow that. Okay. Okay. So actually, it will give me the URL here. If we check that out, I have a new repo here on GitHub created by an AI agent on my behalf. And I think this is where it's going. I think you, as a user or developer, you will be sitting inside your agent environment telling the agent what you want to do, and the agent will do things on your behalf.\n\nNow, if you want to see some other things you can do here, I would say check out the tools here; it will give you some good ideas. So maybe you're noticing something that fits well inside of your own workflow. But I think this is pretty cool, and yeah, it's actually really promising and exciting to see where this goes.\n\nNow I'm going to show you something really cool. So make sure you watch the entire video. But before I continue, I quickly want to show you something else that's also really cool. We live in the age of AI. Everything is changing, including ordering pizza. So how about we order some pizza here? And yes, I could do it manually here and pick all the toppings and the size, manually check out here, fill out my information here, and finally place an order. I could do all of this manually, but it's a lot of work. Since I'm already automating my work with my AI agent, how about I also automate ordering pizza with my AI agent? So I can use Stagehand for this by Browserbase. They are also today's sponsor. So I can start the script, and it's going to order the pizza for me. So it will actually open up a Chrome instance which I'm not controlling. So this is all done for me by the Stagehand script. So you can see it has actually selected the pepperoni topping. It has clicked on to go to the checkout button, and I will scroll down here manually myself just to see what it will do. So let's see—it will fill out the information. Now I'm not typing this myself; it's autonomously doing this for me, and it has clicked on place order, and now my pizza is ordered. It's confirmed, and I didn't even have to do it. It will automatically close out of here as well.\n\nSo what you just saw was possible thanks to Stagehand. Actually, Stagehand—if you've ever done something with Playwright or Puppeteer, it basically powers that with some AI features. So the script that was responsible for this will just go to that website. In this case, it was a local app, but can be a public website as well. You still have the go-to like you're used to from Playwright. But then we have some other methods, some other things we can do on this page like observe and act. And these allow us to describe in natural language what we want to do. So in this case, just observe: wait until that pizza initial page is loaded. We want to act—basically do something: select the medium size. Previously, if you wanted to do something like this, you had to look up the CSS selector and sort of fiddle around with the HTML structure. But now you can just specify it in natural language, and then the LLM will look up the medium size regardless of the HTML structure. Then I also want to add pepperoni topping. These are my favorite settings. So this is just what I can hardcode, but you can also imagine that a script pops up a modal for me, maybe asks me what I want to eat today. And then it can also click on the button like we saw, check to see if the checkout page is loaded. So we have act and observe. We also have extract on the order page. So before we have actually confirmed it, we just quickly want to check if the price, for example, is above a threshold. So we would—we do want to get some actual data here. So we can build in some safeguards essentially. So we can also just ask it to extract some data in JSON format. We can specify a schema here with ZOD, and it will give us the items and the subtotal that are—that is currently in the cart. So before we've confirmed, we are going to check if the pizza is too expensive, right? I don't want to spend more than $25 for…\n\n\nSure, for a pizza, right? So, if that is the case, I'm going to close out of here and exit the process. This is just to build in some safeguard, essentially. Other than that, we will continue. Right? So then, on that other page with the form, we can fill out the information here. And ultimately, of course, we want to click on the \"Place Order\" button. We're going to check if the confirmation page is visible and also extract the final order information. So, we will also log that here, but it can also take a screenshot. In this case, I'm just putting the confirmation image here in my file system. You can see it was ordered, and I can quickly see that everything went all right. And so, you can see how powerful this is to also automate certain workflows. It makes controlling a browser much easier, and I would say even a lot of fun. So, it's a project by Browserbase. We can run that script locally on our own computer, but we can also run it here with Browserbase. And if you've ever tried to deploy something like Puppeteer or Playwright, that is a lot of work; it's a lot of hassle. So, I'm actually really excited to see Browserbase stepping into this space. So, I would say check them out. You can find a link in the description.\n\nAnd now, let's actually continue automating our work with the GitHub MCP. All right. Now, how do you actually set this up? If we scroll down a little bit, you will see in the README here that there is a guide you can follow. Now, it seems you can do it in multiple ways. The way that I got it to run was to actually use Docker. So, you do need to have Docker installed. If you're not familiar with Docker, I don't think that's a big problem because you don't need to do much here, but you do need Docker Desktop, for example. So, I installed that, and it will give you an application that will look something like this. Okay. So, if you have that, once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running, right? So, this application needs to be running. So, on my Mac here, it's in my toolbar; I can see it's running. So, with Docker, you have so-called images. That's what we need to download; that will be the actual MCP server. Okay. So now, we need to download that image. If you scroll up a little bit, you will see under \"Packages\" here for this repo the MCP server image that we need to download. We see the versions of the image that we can download. I tried doing the latest one, but I wasn't able to make it work. So, I'm just going to use the one that was tagged with \"latest.\" So, if I scroll down a little bit here, you will see that here there is one that's actually tagged with \"latest.\" That also seems to be the popular one. So, you need to open up a terminal. I'm using the Terminal app here, but it should work with Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt as well. I can also go inside my code editor here and open up the terminal here; it's the same. So, this image is sitting on the GitHub Container Registry, as it's called. So, we need to log into there so we can actually pull that image onto our computer. So, I can do something like `docker login github.com/container-registry` and I was already logged in, but in case you're not logged in, it will first ask you for the username. So, in my case, that's just my GitHub account username. So, it will be `bytegrad`, and then it will ask you for a password. So, this can be a personal access token here on GitHub. So, if you go to your GitHub account settings and then scroll down to developer settings, and then here on the left side you have personal access tokens. Now, I was able to make it work with tokens classic. And here, I can create a personal access token. So, basically, I can, so I or a tool on my behalf, can programmatically interact with my account. So, you want to be very careful with this. Don't show it to anyone else unless you know what you're doing. So, you can generate a new token here. I was able to make it work with the classic option here. And you can give it a name. I used the shortest expiration date and the scopes. So, think about what you want to allow to happen on your account. Probably you want to be a little bit careful with write operations, especially delete operations, right? So, I would probably be inclined to only approve read operations, so maybe you just want to allow read operations just to try it out. So you can check the scopes, and then you can generate the token. Okay, so it will give you a token; that's what you need to pass as the password to log in. You will also need it later in a second for the MCP server. Actually, once you're able to log in, now we can actually pull that image onto our computer. So now, we can run `docker pull`. Actually, we can copy this, but I will. Right. So now, I can paste this here. Now, we're not going to pull this one, so I can remove this one with this. I was able to make it work with just \"latest\" here, so I'll press Enter here, and if it's the first time, it's going to download; it may take a second, a couple of seconds, but for me, it was already downloaded, so it's not going to do it again. So, once you have that in your Docker Desktop, you will see some image here. So that's for the Docker setup. Now, you need to make it work with your AI agent. So, I was using Visual Studio Code, and that, and they have a button here. So, if you click on that, it will open this up in Visual Studio Code. We get some options here. I can click on \"Install Server.\" So, if you do that, it will set things up in your settings.json for you, and it will also prompt you for the personal access token. So, you can give the same token again. And here, you can see it's blurred out, so it's not—so you want to be very careful with that. Don't show it to anyone else. Right? So, once you have that, at least in Visual Studio Code, you can try to open up this; you can set it in agent mode, and then you can open up this tools menu here, and you should be able to see this MCP.\n\n\nThe server in this list will show you the tools associated with that. When you see that, it should be installed properly. So then you can try something like, \"Give me all open GitHub issues,\" and the model should identify that it's able to call a tool for that and use those tools. That's how it's supposed to work. So, it's really cool to see this MCP server standard developing. I'm really excited to see where it goes.  Hope this is helpful for you. I want to thank BrowserBase for sponsoring the video. Check them out. You can find a link in the description. And I want to thank you for watching. Hope to see you in the next one.\n",
