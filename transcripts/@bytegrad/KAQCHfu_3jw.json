  "cleanText": "So you want to learn Next.js. This is the video to get started. I will go through it pretty quickly because it's just meant as a high-level overview. I have many other Next.js videos on my channel if you want to go more in depth. So let's just quickly get into it. So let me quickly show you how a Next.js app is structured. And then I will also show you a realistic example. So we have one Next.js app. This entire thing is one Next.js app. There is both a client side which runs in the browser as well as a server side which runs on some server. And this may be new to you because maybe previously you were learning React and traditionally React was only running in the browser. So there was only a client side. But of course for a real application you often also need server side capabilities. For example, if you need to make some API call to open AI, right? For an AI feature, you need some secret key, for example, secret API key. You cannot do that on the client side. You're going to leak your API key. So you would then still need some kind of server app and actually for many other things as well. So actually in my view one of the reasons why Next.js became popular is because it simplifies creating a full stack application by unifying both the client side and server side in one app. And this also allows for some optimizations. So a react server component only runs on the server. So if there is something heavy that needs to be computed, it can already be done on the server. We don't have to ship all of that code to the user's browser. So there's many optimizations we can do. We still have many client components as well. So these are React components that run in the browser. Typically used for like a button when you need to hook into some browser event like a click event or a change event or a submit event. Those events happen in the browser. They do not happen in a server. Right? So in that case if your component needs to hook into those well they need to be client components and so their code will be shipped to the client to the browser. Also, if you want to use React hooks like use state and use effect, those also only work in client components. So, this is still an important part, but a lot of the things that we will talk about will actually be serverside features. So, React server components allow us to run components only on the server. Their result will be sent to the browser. So, we can still see them. We can also fetch data in server components. It actually has many advantages. A server component is a good place to fetch data to get data into your app. So if we get data in a server component, how about submitting data? Well, traditionally you would have to create some kind of API endpoint and we can still do that actually. So Next.js allows us to create API endpoints. So you can do a fetch post call let's say to an API endpoint. However, it is actually much more ergonomic to use a server action in many cases. This is basically just a function that runs only on the server, but we can trigger it from the browser and Next.js under the hood will wire everything up and make sure that the data will go from the user's browser to our server side. So, it's basically just a function and it's much more ergonomic for us as developers to do it that way than setting up a whole API endpoint. I will show you that as well in a second. Now, sometimes we still need to create an API endpoint ourselves. The server actions, they have some limitations. So, if we want, we can still do this as well. A lot of these concepts may be new to you, so don't worry if you're a little bit confused. That's totally normal. But, let's actually take a look at an example. So let's say we want to build some kind of blog website or application. We just have one homepage and we just have a very simple header here on top. We have a footer here on the bottom and we have some content here in the middle. That's the homepage. Now I can also go to /posts. This is another page. But notice that both the header as well as the footer, they stay the exact same. We do not have to rerender them. They can stay the exact same. We only have to change the part that is sandwiched in between there which is going to be for in this case the post. So we have a heading and then we have two posts. We are fetching this from a database. If I click on the first one, we only have to change this part in the middle again for the content of that post. You can see the URL now contains the ID of that post. So what we need to render here, what we need to display to the user is the post that corresponds to that URL. So we need to retrieve the ID from the URL, find the right post in the database and display that here. This showcases the fundamentals of a Next.js application. But let's actually see how that would work. So let me actually open up my code editor. I actually already opened a folder here. So now I want to build that application. Where do I start? How do I start building it? Well, I can open up my terminal and I can write MPX create next app. And I just want to use the latest one. Now, if you just write it like this, it will actually create a new folder inside here, but I just created this folder. So, actually, I wanted to put all of the files in this folder that I just opened up. I can do it by just adding a period here. And it will walk you through a set of wizards. I will just go with all of the defaults here. So, yes, TypeScript, yes, eslint, tailwind, yes, I do want to use source directory, yes, we want to use the app router. So, Turopac is a more recent addition here. This is meant as sort of an innovation over Webpack or other bundlers. It's supposed to be much faster. So I will go with that as well. And we want to leave this as the default as well. So this is to prevent that dot dot slash dot dot/ in your file import path. So I will press enter here. And it will create all of these files essentially and then also install the dependency. So we will get a note modules folder in a second as well. Okay. So now it's finished. Let's actually just see what we get here. So there's a bunch of files here. It may be a little bit overwhelming if it's the first time that you see this. What do we actually see here? So a JavaScript project is often structured like this. So basically you have a bunch of configuration files. So for example we have some file for how TypeScript should behave and we have some file here for Next.js itself actually and we have some post CSS file. This is used by Tailwind. Basically just telling those tools how they should behave. And then here we have the note modules folder. This is going to be packages that our project depends on. This project is just a starter basically just a sort of a starter template to get a complete fullstack app quickly without manually setting everything up. So things like tailwind and typescript are already set up so we don't have to manually do it ourselves. A JavaScript project often has a package.json file. This basically is a description of of our project and what it depends on. So you can see here under dependencies this project depends on the react package, the React DOM package and the next package. And during development we also need these packages. So basically we use eslint during development for example. So those packages all have to be installed and those packages in turn may also have other packages. So you have a tree of dependencies and that's what we get here. So you see a lot of things here that are installed for this project. You will not see these names all in here because they may be subd dependencies. Basically there's a tree. Now the whole tree is basically described in package lock.json. So this is necessary. Okay. So if other people on your team want to get the exact same version that you have, it can be done with this. So then we also have a public folder here. So this is meant for let's say your logo or other assets that you may use in your app. And then here we have the source directory. So this is where you will be spending most of your time as a developer. This is the actual source code of the app, you could say. So that's why I like using the source folder cuz it separates that out from all the configuration and other things in the app. Now actually in the source and it's actually a little bit tricky how it displays here perhaps we have another folder here the app folder so actually what we see here these files are all in the app folder this is the app router nextjs and these files they have a special name so these names they actually give them some special behavior so for example here we have a page ttsx file and it's sitting directly as a child of app so this means actually that this page is for simply your domain slash so this is like the homepage. So if I actually run this app, how do I know how to run it? Well, if that's also described in package.json. Here we have some script. This is the development script. You can see I'm using Turboac here. So this should make it faster than just using like a Webpack or other bundlers. The reason it needs to be bundled as it's called in the first place is because for example we are using TypeScript TSX. This the browser does not understand TypeScript. The browser only understands HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, it's nice for us as developers to use TypeScript because they help us develop the app. It basically forces us to be a little bit more strict with our code. So, it's basically a developer tool. However, to run it in a browser, we need to compile that from TypeScript into JavaScript, right? And also, we are using Tillwind here. So, if I open up the homepage, there's a bunch of class names here, and the browser does not understand this grid row blah blah blah class name. This doesn't mean anything. So it's actually Tailwind that will take this class and generate normal CSS out of this. Also here we are using an image component from Next.js. This is sitting in some other file. So we can sort of combine multiple files into one and then give that to the browser. That's basically bundling a bunch of steps required just to make it ready for the browser and do some other things. Now at some point we will also want to go to production as it's called. Basically allow other people on the internet interact with our app. we can create a so-called production build. In that case, we're going to optimize it as much as possible. Remove all the white space to make the files as small as possible. Basically, a bunch of optimizations. And then if you want to run the production build, we can use this start script here. Okay. Now, in this case, we just we are in development mode. So, I'm just going to run this here during development. So, I need to run this script. So, I can open up my terminal here. Let me clear this out. I can say mpm rundev. And it will run that script. Next dev turbo pack. Okay. So now you can see this is the this is the output that you get and I can hold command click on this. Okay. Let me actually go there here. All right. So here what you see here this is the homepage right. This is just forward slash or well without forward slashes. It's the same. How does it know what's display here? Well well that is that page.tsx in the root of the app folder. That's what we see here. Right. So all of this stuff here it's a lot of boiler plate here. That's what we see here. So if I change something here get started by editing. If I just add a bunch of exclamation marks, if I command S, save the file, you can see now I have these exclamation marks here. Okay. Now, of course, we don't want to have this. So, one of the first things I often do is just remove all of the boiler plate here. So, we can get started with building what we actually want to build. I will also remove this. And now the homepage will be completely empty. So, now you can see it's it's gone, but it's still dark here. So, my computer is actually in dark mode. That's why it has a black background. is if your computer is in light mode, it will show a light background here. How is that possible? Well, if we go to globals.css, there are also some default CSS styles here. So, you can see our app is using Tailwind, but then it also has added a bunch of other things here for styling. I often also start by just removing everything here. So, one of the So, one of those things is this media query for the color scheme. So, you can see my computer is set in a dark preference mode. So in that case it will actually change the colors of the So actually I want to remove this and just start from a clean slate. So now if I do this you can see it's completely empty but I still want to keep the Tailwind CSS import here. So if we want to build this simple app where do we start? Well let's actually start off with routing. So on the homepage we should see this and then if I go to /posts I want to see this. Right? Very simple but it will actually teach a lot about how Next.js is structured. So on the homepage I basically want to have this markup right so I just copy this right so just a bunch of markup we're using till CSS and we can learn all about that but I want to focus on the Next.js fundamentals here so it's just a bunch of markup right so just like you used to but this is not the same as what we have in the preview because here we also have a header and a footer and I don't have that here so should I now add that here on the homepage should I add a header here let's say right I could do that right so here I could add a header let's say I could style it differently The problem is if you do it this way then if we want to have the same header on other pages as well like the posts page we would then have to duplicate this for those pages as well. Right? So that's not what we want to do. The header and footer should be part of you could say the core layout of the entire website. We also have a layout file here. So if we go here this is another file that we need to know about. What we see here is actually the HTML and body tag. So the way this works is Next.js will pass in the page that we are on as children here. It looks a bit strange but you can imagine that if we are on the homepage this whatever we have here right this is the homepage it will be like this right that's how you can think of it and if we are on the on a\n\n\nDifferent page, the posts page.\nThe post page will be in here, so every page is sandwiched in between this body and HTML tag.\nSo, if we want to have something on every page, I can actually also just add it here, right?\nSo, if I add it here, it will be on every page, and the same for the footer.\nSo now, if I go to the homepage, we can see there is this gibberish.\nI will change this in a second, and on the bottom as well.\nAnd now, if we go to some other page, well, the other page will be in here.\nSo there will still be a header and footer as well.\nSo let's actually create a new page now.\nHow do we do that?\nSo these pages are all based on the folder structure actually.\nSo I need to create a new folder for posts, and then if I want to have a page for that route, so /posts, in there I have to create another page.tsx file.\nSo here I can have another page component, and the mark and the markup on this page will be a little bit different, but very similar.\nIt will just be an empty list for now.\nSo now if I go to /posts, if I go here, you can see I have posts here, but we still have the header and footer uh here as well.\nEven though I'm not adding it to each individual page, it's because that posts page is going to be this this children here, and therefore it will still be sandwiched in between header and footer.\nNow, let me actually improve this.\nOf course, we would typically create a React component out of a header, for example.\nNow, let me actually close these pages.\nSo, how do I create a component here?\nWell, technically, I could do it in here in the app folder, and some people do that, and there's nothing wrong with that.\nIt's just a matter of preference.\nBut what I like to do is I like to keep the app folder for routing purposes, and then if I want something like components, I create its own folder for that outside the app router.\nSo still in source, I can do right click on source, and here I will have component, right?\nAnd then here, for example, I can have a header component, header.tsx.\nSo, and also let's say a footer.tsx as well.\nSo let me just quickly add these.\nSo here I now have a header component.\nI'm just hard coding some logo.\nBut of course, in a header, we also have a we typically also have some links.\nAnd if I click on a link, we actually do want to navigate.\nSo Next.js has a link component that I can import like this.\nWe have to specify the href.\nIt will actually just be an anchor tag on the page.\nSo very similar to what you're used to.\nSo why not just use an anchor tag?\nWell, if you do an anchor tag like this, you will actually get a whole new HTML file when you go to that page.\nBasically, a hard navigation.\nHowever, in a React application like this, we don't want to have a whole new HTML file.\nWe only want to essentially swap out this part here for the new page.\nUh let me actually show you that.\nSo if I now use that header component, I can import it like this.\nOkay.\nSo now if I go back here, we have a header component here.\nAnd here we use those links.\nIf I click on home here, it's only the part in the middle that gets changed.\nSo basically, React or Next.js is rendering some different content here depending on the navigation we make.\nWe're not loading a whole new HTML file from the server.\nSo this is typically a better experience because we don't need to change everything on the page.\nWe don't need to change the header or footer, only the part in the middle.\nLet me also quickly add the footer here.\nOkay.\nSo I just added a simple footer here.\nLet me close out of here and let me replace this gibberish with a nice clean component.\nSo now every page is sandwiched between these components.\nSo now we have this footer here, and you can see when I navigate, it's only the part in the middle that gets changed.\nAnd let's see, it's not sitting at the bottom.\nSo sticky footer problem.\nSome problems never go away.\nOkay.\nSo what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to also restrict the width of the page actually.\nSo if we look at the example, you can see I have maximized, I have basically restricted the width here a little bit and gave it a different background color.\nI think it looks a bit better.\nSo I'm going to create a div here, and I'll put everything inside that div.\nThat div will have a maximum width, as you can see here.\nI'm going to center that div, and I'm also going to add some flex styling here so we can push that footer to the bottom of the page.\nI also added this background color.\nSo now if we go back, you can see we have a pretty decent looking with the footer at the bottom, and if I navigate, it's only the part in the middle that gets changed.\nAbout the folder structure, you can see now in the source folder I have two folders, one called app, right?\nWe're in the app router in Next.js, not the pages router.\nIn the app router, we use the folder structure here with page.tsx tsx to create pages.\nSo the name of the folder will be in the URL.\nSo /post will give us this because I have a folder called post and it has this page.tsx in there.\nSo that will be rendered for that URL.\nThe homepage is in here because it's just the root of the app folder.\nYou can see in the header I'm actually just using a some text for the logo.\nThis is often an image.\nSo instead of just hard coding logo, I may also want to use an image.\nYou can use the plain HTML image tag.\nHowever, Next.js also allows you to use the a dedicated component for this, the image component.\nThis comes with some optimizations out of the box.\nSo, typically you specify the width and height.\nThis may help with content layout shift.\nYou may also want to prioritize it.\nAnd we need to link to the actual image file.\nSo, the image file, I could add that here to that public folder that we discussed before.\nHowever, often it's also going to be some uh full URL somewhere on the internet.\nSo I may actually use clonary, for example, as my as a place where I upload images, and so you may have a URL like this, basically some other website.\nNow here I get an error, and that's because when you do it like this, you do need to allow that uh domain basically.\nSo out of safety reasons, we have to go to our next config uh file, and here we need to explicitly allow that we want to allow images from this domain to be loaded.\nRight?\nSo if I do something like this, now the error is gone and I have my image here.\nTypically if people click on the logo, they expect to go to the homepage.\nSo I can actually also wrap this in a link.\nLet's see if I click on this, I go to the home page.\nAll right.\nSo now we have a homepage and this posts page.\nBut of course, we don't have any posts yet here.\nIt's just an empty list.\nThere is no data actually that we are fetching from somewhere.\nSo let's talk about data fetching in the latest Next.js.\nSo let's actually go to that page.\nSo here we have post, and you can see it's an empty list.\nSo how do we get the data in here?\nWell, previously in a React component, you would do something like a use effect, right?\nSo something like this.\nAnd here you would fetch your data, and then once you have the data, you would put it in uh maybe some use state, some state.\nSo the traditionally it would look something like this.\nAnd if we go back to our diagram here, this still works by the way, but it would be a client component.\nMeaning this can only run on the client in the browser.\nSo this may actually be slower because before we can fetch our data, all of the code for that page has to be loaded and then the client component get can can start getting the data.\nIn XJS, we have a server component.\nAll of the components that you see here that we've used so far are actually server component.\nSo you could say that by default all components are server component.\nAnd one of the things you can do in a server component is you can mark it as async and you can fetch data directly in here without react hook.\nSo I can say something like const uh response, and then I can use some uh dummy data from uh a third party just as just to show you how this would work.\nSo this may look very strange to you that we can do something like this.\nI now have my data, and now here we can populate this list with the actual post.\nRight?\nSo this may actually look very strange to you if you're not used to seeing React components on the server server component, but this is something we can do, and this is I would say like the idiomatic way of fetching data in a Next.js application.\nNo react hooks, fetch directly in the component function body like this to get the data.\nSo now if I go to my posts page, what will happen?\nWell, let's actually see here, you can see I have a bunch of posts now.\nRight.\nSo if I load this page, what happens when when somebody loads this page?\nWell, this page component is rendered as it's called, meaning all of the statements inside here will run.\nAnd what are we doing in there?\nWe are just fetching data.\nAnd here and here we are and here we are returning something.\nNow the render result of this.\nSo ultimately when the final result here has been computed, the result of this is sent to the client to the browser.\nThat's why we can still see this.\nThis is a server component, but we can still see it here.\nA server component just means that it runs only on the server side.\nThe result of that run, the render result is still sent to the client.\nSo we can still see it here, right?\nSo this code only runs on the server side, but the render result of this is still sent to the browser.\nSo that's why we still see it here.\nNow here I'm just fetching data from some third party website, but typically we would have our own database.\nSo how would that look like?\nGo back to our diagram here.\nSo here basically from a server component getting data from some third party web server, right?\nWe would get the data and we would compute the output.\nThe output would then still be sent to the client.\nOkay.\nNow, typically, of course, we have our own database.\nSo, we're not going to get data from a random third party, but at least very often, we just have our own database.\nWe will have some database data basically where we store our data.\nIn this case, our post.\nAnd this is where we want to get the data from from our server side.\nSo, just to draw this here.\nSo, from our server side, we basically want to get our data.\nAnd typically and very often you would use some kind of OM like Prisma or Drizzle to make that a bit easier.\nSo let me actually set it up so we can actually get data with Prisma from our own database.\nAll right, so I just changed the code a little bit.\nSo now I'm actually fetching data again, but now I'm using a so-called OM to get data from my own database.\nI set up a quick SQLite database and I'm using Prisma here to interact with that.\nI have a whole video on using Prisma.\nAnd you don't need to understand that for now, just to understand conceptually how we're getting data into our app.\nBut basically I'm going to reach out to my own database.\nI'm going to get the post here, and we can do it directly here in a React component.\nIt looks super strange maybe for you because traditionally you would use use effect, but you could not use something like Prisma to interact with your own database because you were doing that all from the client side, and typically you do not interact with your own database directly from the client side.\nThis looks strange because previously you were essentially only using so-called client components.\nWe'll talk about those a little bit more in a second.\nBut now we actually are using a lot of server components.\nIn fact, all of the components that we've seen so far are server components.\nAnd so you can fetch data from our own database, right?\nWe can from our own Next.js server side from our own database.\nWe're getting the data into our Next.js app and we will compute some result.\nAnd the result of this will then be sent to the client so we can still see it.\nSo now if I go to my app here and I refresh, well, it actually is still empty because the database is empty.\nSo let's actually add some posts to our database.\nPrisma actually has a nice feature.\nI can use MPX Prisma Studio to to inspect what is in my database.\nYou can see there is one model here, but there are no posts in here.\nLet's actually add one just to see.\nSo we'll just add first the content first post.\nSo now I will save this.\nLet's actually add one more second.\nCool.\nSo now I'm going to save this.\nThis is my database.\nSo now this data is in my database.\nNow if I refresh here, you can see we have some actual data in our app here retrieved from our own database directly from a server component.\nSo pretty cool.\nAnd this has many benefits.\nThis is in many ways better than fetching on the client side.\nIf that is not immediately obvious to you, by the way, that's actually completely fine.\nIt actually takes some time to really appreciate these subtle differences and to also understand what the actual benefits are.\nSo in my view, it comes a bit later in your learning journey before you fully understand why this is a big benefit in some cases, but just knowing that it's possible and just to see this, I think help.\nYou can also see here in the list that we have an LI, and then we want to have a link because if I click on that, I want to see the actual content of the post.\nSo we're linking to the ID of that post.\nSo what what we want the URL to be is slashposts and then slash the ID of that post, and then what we actually display as text on the page is going to be the title, right?\nFirst or second.\nWhen I click on the first one now, you can see the URL changes to post/1.\nHowever, we don't have anything for that URL yet.\nWe don't have a page.tsx for that particular URL yet.\nSo we get a bit of a strange result here also with the color.\nSo let's actually fix that now.\nSo in this case, we want to have a page as actually see by the way, I changed the folder structure a little bit.\nSo now we have the app router for all the routing related logic.\nI have my components folder for my component.\nNow I also added this lib folder.\nThis is what I typically use for the database setup or maybe my types or utility functions.\nBut now we want to have a routing related issue solved.\nSo that is for the URL.\nSo when we go to slashposts and then another slash.\nSo slash one for example or two.\nWe also want to have a page.\nSo we actually need to create a separate one since it's going to be a slash after posts.\nIt actually needs to be\n\n\nA new folder inside post.\nAnd this is a so-called dynamic route because it could be one, or it could be two, or it could be 500, right?\nWe can have thousands of blog posts, and they can all have different IDs.\nIt's not just going to be one hardcoded name for that.\nIt's going to be dynamic.\nSo we have these square brackets, and this is going to be the ID of the post.\nSo I'm calling that dynamic value in the URL an ID.\nOkay.\nAnd then in there, we will have another page.tsx segment of the route.\nSo on that page, I would like to have the post title here and then the content of the post in here.\nSo right now, you can see the weird result is gone, but we still have an empty page here essentially.\nSo of course, when somebody lands on this page, maybe they just landed directly, maybe they got a link from somebody else and just pasting it and pressing enter here, right?\nSo it doesn't matter how they get here, we need to be able to see what the user, which post the user wants to see, so we can only do that by looking at the URL.\nSo we need to get the ID of the post that the user wants to see from the URL.\nSo how do you do that?\nHow can we get that from here so that we know the ID of the post and then we can get the actual post details from our database?\nSo we need to get the ID, and these page components are also a little bit special in Next.js.\nSo we can get them by using the params prop here.\nSo we can get the params, and then from there, we can get the ID.\nNow these params, since it's also a bit recent, but this is now async.\nSo meaning I have to do async await here.\nSo it looks a bit strange, but I can do await params, and then what do I want from there?\nI want to get the ID.\nOkay, so this looks a bit strange, but params is just how we can get the dynamic value in the URL.\nHow do I know it's dot ID?\nWhy is it not something else?\nWe gave this a name of ID in the square brackets here.\nSo then when you want to retrieve it, that's also the name you have to use here.\nOkay, so then I have the ID of the post the user wants to see.\nThen I can retrieve that post from my database.\nSo we can see the content and so on.\nSo I'm going to use Prisma again.\nAnd now it's a different method, find unique, where the ID of the post is whatever we got from the URL.\nThat's going to be a string, by the way.\nSo we do need to, I'm going to cast it to a number, and then here we will get the actual post detail.\nSo what I want to have is here the title and here the content.\nSo if we do this, and now you can see when I go to the URL of posts/1, I will get that link that is indeed the right one.\nIf I now go to, well, let's go to slashposts.\nNow if I click on the second one, we will go to slash2, and again we get a new post here with the right data.\nSo this is a very common structure where you have some dynamic value, and you need to get that from the URL.\nSo you can use the page component.\nWe have special props here.\nYou can get it like this.\nLooks a bit strange perhaps, but this is in a nutshell how that's done.\nNow let's actually work on the types here.\nSo this params is actually a promise, and we will get an ID with a string.\nLooks very strange.\nSo if you're confused about this, don't worry.\nIt always looks a bit strange here with the types.\nWe have another type issue here because technically the post can also be undefined, right?\nSo if the user types in some gibberish here, this is an ID that does not exist.\nSo in this case, we would get an ID that doesn't exist.\nIt may not be a post.\nSo we may have, we may want to have some guard here.\nAnd in this case, if there is nothing here, and in this case, what I'm doing is I'm using the not found function here.\nThis is also a bit of a special Next.js.\nThis is also a special Next.js feature because if you do this, it will actually render not what we have here in the standard page.\nBut you can create a separate file.\nWe can say not-found.tsx and we can say, we can say not found, and we can just say this is not found.\nThis will be rendered if that's the case.\nSo now if I make this just an ID that doesn't that we don't have, you can see we get not found here.\nSo this is another special file in Next.js, and there are some other special ones as well: loading.tsx.\nWe also have an error file.\nSo, there's a bunch of files that you may want to use, although this one is not as common as page.tsx.\nTypically, you will always have a layout file and a bunch of page.tsx files.\nAnd the other ones, I would say, are more optional.\nSo, what we just did is essentially getting data into our app.\nVery common in an app.\nWe want to get data, right?\nSo, you could say your get requests are typically going to be done in a server component like this.\nAnd I'm using Prisma here, but can be some other ORM.\nYou may be doing some plain fetch call to some other servers, but you're getting data into the app typically like this on a server component.\nThe page typically it can also be done in some other component you have.\nSo we get the data here and then we render it, and then this will be computed, and the result of that will still be sent to the client.\nSo we still see it in the browser.\nNow what if we actually want to submit data?\nAlso a very common feature in many apps.\nWe want to actually add some data to our database or edit some data or delete some data.\nSo these are your traditional post, put, delete requests, you could say, and traditionally you would create some kind of API endpoint that is actually also a little bit different here in Next.js.\nSo I would say the idiomatic way, basically the standard way of doing these would be with so-called server actions.\nSo just to give an example of those as well, let's say I have a form to create a post.\nSo we want to add to the posts in our database.\nSo here on the /osts page, I added a form for a title.\nLet's say I want to have a third post.\nHere is the third post.\nOkay.\nNow when I click here, I want to add a third post.\nI want to add a third post to our database.\nSo let's actually take a look here on the posts page.\nHere we have that list.\nAnd then below here, I added this form.\nSo the form will have an input text area and a button here, right?\nVery standard so far.\nNow traditionally what you would do is when the user clicks on this button, there is a submit event.\nSo you could hook into that submit event.\nYou could do something like onsubmit, and you would have some function here, and you would just do something like fetch to your own API.\nYou would do something like API posts, and then you would send along the data in the body, right?\nThis is very traditional, and technically you can still do that, but it's much, this is a lot of work.\nYou have to create a separate API endpoint.\nThen you need to make sure you get the URL right.\nYou have to sort of configure all of that stuff yourself.\nWell, Next.js now, and this is also much easier because instead of doing this, we can remove all of this.\nWe can create a so-called server action.\nBasically, just a function.\nTechnically, I could create that here in this file here.\nAlthough I think it's a bit cleaner to put them in their own files because they're quite important.\nI think it's a bit cleaner to separate them out into their own file.\nSo, if we take a look here, I can actually also have a folder here for actions, and I will just have one file actions.ts.\nSo these are going to be functions that run only on the server.\nWe do need to mark them with use server here at the top.\nAnd it's just going to be a function.\nSo we can say export this function for creating a post.\nIt will need to get the data here, of course.\nSo here I can create a function called create post, and it will get the form data, and we're going to grab the title and content from there.\nAnd we're going to insert that into our database here.\nAnd this function will run only on the server side.\nAnd we can actually use that here.\nSo here for form, we can now specify the action attribute, and I can specify the name of that function.\nSo Next.js will know, oh, when this form is submitted, this is the function that needs to be invoked, and we need to pass the form data to this function.\nNow if I try to submit this, right?\nSo now if I click on create post, we actually get an issue, and that is because I'm trying to get the data from the form like this format get title.\nNow that works with a name attribute.\nSo I do need to specify the name here for each input.\nAnd this content is, and this text area is going to be for the content.\nSo let's try this again.\nThird post.\nThird post here.\nNow if I click on create post, you can see the data of the form here actually is removed.\nBut now if I inspect my database, if I refresh here, you can see I have a third post here.\nAnd I didn't even have to set up a whole API endpoint and making sure everything is wired properly because I was using a server action, which means all of that is done for me behind the scenes by Next.js.\nSo now I have this third post here in my database.\nUm, so now if I refresh the /ost page, you can see I have another post here.\nIf I try to add another one, fourth post number four here.\nIf I click on create post, and I refresh this here in my database, I can see there is another one here.\nAnd if I refresh my app itself, we can also see that one right here.\nSo you can see this is much easier than what we had before where you had to do onsubmit or something like that.\nCreate a whole API endpoint.\nNow it's basically just a function here, and that is all done for you behind the scenes.\nNow how's that possible?\nBecause here I'm in my browser, right?\nHow is it possible that the data from this form goes to the server side?\nWell, let's actually inspect the network tab to see what is going on when I press create post there.\nSo here, if I do it again, fifth post number five.\nIf I click on create post here, you can see there is still a network call.\nSo there is still my browser making a fetch call.\nWell, actually /ost request method.\nAnd if we take a look at the payload, you can see the data of the form is in there.\nSo what happens here is that Next.js will automatically take the data from the form and submit it to this function on my server side here automatically for me.\nI don't have to worry about the underlying details of how that is done.\nSo basically the network boundary is abstracted away for me, which simplifies things a lot.\nNow one of my favorite features about the server actions is, well, what we had to do now is every time when I added something here, I have to refresh the page, right?\nSo if I do this, if I create post, and now it's submitted, but I don't see it here yet.\nI have to manually refresh here or go to this page again to see the post.\nIt would be nice that it would automatically show that for me, and we can do that actually.\nSo there is a function called revalidate path here in Next.js, and we can basically tell Next.js, hey, after we have inserted this post into our database, revalidate this slash post, which me, which will actually trigger a rerender for that particular route.\nSo now if I do seventh post number seven, if I now create post here, you can see I didn't even refresh, but it will automatically update this page as well after it has added it to a database.\nIf I click on any of them, by the way, we can see the title and the content here.\nBut this is one of my favorite features, and it makes server actions very powerful.\nAnd here we are just creating a form, but you can imagine it would be very similar for editing a post or deleting a post.\nBasically your traditional mutations, post, put, delete, you may want to use a server action for that in Next.js.\nSaves you a lot of hassle with spinning up API endpoints.\nNow, if we don't have API endpoints anymore, then what are these route handlers for?\nBecause we can still create API endpoints if we want.\nBut if we are already using server actions for this, why do we even need?\nWell, the server actions, they have some limitations sometimes.\nSo, in some circumstances, you still may want to have an API endpoint.\nBut a very common use case for them is so-called web hooks.\nIf you have, for example, payments in your app, and somebody has made a payment, maybe they have subscribed to you, and you're using Stripe, let's say for that, Stripe is going to notify you that, hey, somebody paid, and they're going to send a request to your server side, right?\nTypically, you don't use server actions for that.\nYou use an API endpoint for that.\nSlash API, web hooks, stripe, perhaps something like this.\nStripe will notify you, hey somebody paid.\nAnd so we can then process that, update some of their data in their database so that so that the user can get access to something, for example.\nSo basically that request from some other service on the internet to our server side to notify us of something of some event, those are typically called web hooks, and I would say these route handlers are the way to go for those.\nBut there are some other use cases as well.\nTo create an API endpoint like that, there is another special file called router.ts.\nSo if I want to have API web hooks stripe, I go into my app, I would create a new folder.\nUh, I can do web hooks, and then in there another folder called stripe, and then in there I have this special file called route.ts.\nAnd then here I can have, well, a web hook is typically a post method.\nSo I would export some post function here that would take in the incoming request.\nAnd you can see this would be a quick example here.\nI'm not sure if this is 100% correct, but you would process this tribe web hook in here.\nOkay.\nSo I would expose an API endpoint like this.\nAll right.\nSo actually we talked a lot about the server side features here, but we haven't talked much about client versus server components.\nSo the way to think of those in my view is basically a server component only runs on the server.\nA client component runs in the browser.\nAnd what is the benefit of that of running in the browser?\nWell, it means if there is, let's say, a click event, then we can hook into that event.\nSo maybe for each of these posts, we want to add an up vote button.\nNow if the user clicks on this button, we may want to do something like\n\n\nlog something to the console or\nshow an alert or do an animation or\ndo some other things.\nBasically, we want to do something when there is a click on this button, which means a click event.\nThe click event only happens in the browser.\nThere is no click event on the server side.\nSo if we want to hook into that click event, what you would do, well, you would do something like on click, right?\nClick event is very common, maybe even the most common one in a form input or something else you often have on change.\nThere are many other events actually that you may want to hook into, typically when it's very interactive.\nIn our example here, this is a simple blog app.\nSo you have a lot of consuming content when we're just reading text basically.\nIt's not super interactive.\nHowever, there are some apps that are very interactive where the user is clicking a lot and doing a lot of things.\nSo in that case, you want to hook into a lot of events.\nRight.\nNow here we have one simple event on click.\nWhen that happens, we want to run a function.\nLet's say we only want to do something very simple.\nWe want to do a log, right?\nConsole log up clicked.\nMaybe also alert, right?\nJust a simple example.\nBut when I save here now, you will see that we run into an error because this is still a server component.\nSo this button in a server component, this page here, and hooking into those events only works in the browser.\nSo at this point we have to convert it into a so-called client component.\nNow you can do that with use client.\nSo I can add use client here to the top.\nAnd technically now if I go here, you can see now the error is actually gone.\nBut we have some other issues now because now we still have this async await like what we have here.\nYou cannot fetch data like this in a client component.\nRight?\nSo this only works like this in a server component.\nAnd also a lot of these other things on the page.\nWe may have many other things here are also affected by this even though they have nothing to do with this upvote stuff.\nRight?\nSo this H1 and a paragraph, this text here, this can stay on the server side.\nIf we have other things here, maybe other components that fetch data that have nothing to do with the upfot, that can stay on the server side.\nThe only thing that really needs to run in the browser is this button logic.\nSo typically you want to be very precise with what needs to run in the browser.\nSo in this case, yeah, the button needs to run in the browser, but we don't have to make the whole page a client component.\nSo I can remove it here.\nEverything here can stay on the server except for this button here.\nSo what we could do, what you typically want to do in this case is just create a separate component for this, right?\nSo we can say upload button and I'm just going to copy all of that logic that we just had to this particular component.\nAnd this is the component I'm going to turn into a client component.\nOkay?\nThen I can copy that and I can remove all of this, replace it with this component.\nOkay.\nSo now all of this on the page can stay on the server.\nThis can all stay a server component and we just have one little island of interactivity you could say where we do need to hook into an event in the browser, the click event in this case.\nAnd that's what we have marked as a client component.\nSo this will run in the browser.\nRight?\nSo now if I click on this button, we see the alert here and also here in the browser.\nRight?\nSo what you're going to get is a lot of content, a lot of computation done on the server side and then you may have some places on your page that need to be interactive, meaning the user can click on things and typically you want to put those uh things in their own components and just mark those as client components.\nSo in a client you can hook into events.\nYou can also use React hooks like use state and use effect.\nYou cannot use them on server.\nYou cannot use those in server component.\nSo in an app that is very interactive like a dashboard app where the user is clicking and changing a bunch of things, those are typically going to have a lot of client component.\nHowever on a website like a blog website, you're going to have a lot of things on the server side because we don't have to hook into a lot of events or React hooks.\nSo typically if you can, you do want to keep things on the server side.\nRight.\nSo the server components, they do have some uh benefit and typically only when you really need to, you want to make them a client component, but by default it is essentially all server components.\nSo that is basically how a full stack Next.js application including a database is structured.\nNow there's one important thing that we haven't discussed yet, which is authentication.\nNow in many apps you will also need some kind of authentication because you will have some data or some page that only logged in users should be able to access.\nLet's say or you have some paid feature and only paying subscribers should be able to access it.\nSo here we get into the realm of authentication, basically restricting access depending on the user's authentication status.\nSo in our application, maybe we only want to allow logged in users to be able to access the post.\nEveryone should be able to view the homepage.\nYou could say that's a public route.\nBut then the posts themselves, we only want to allow logged in users to view them.\nSo both the /posts page as well as the individual post page should be protected, meaning only logged in users should be able to access them.\nAll right.\nNow what does that mean technically when a user is logged in?\nWhat does that practically look like?\nWell that means that when a user wants to see a certain page and a page as we saw is going to be typically a uh a server component page server component.\nSo when the user is going to attempt to access those pa one of those pages, we're going to check if that user has a valid JSON web token JWT as it's called.\nBasically some information that the user will have in their browser and then if they want to access a restricted resource, they're going to have to show that information.\nIn our case, a J a JSON web token.\nNow we could implement authentication ourselves.\nUnfortunately, it's very errorprone and it's very timeconuming to set everything up ourselves.\nIt's not only about username and password.\nThere are many other things to think about.\nSocial login like login with Google and these things, but also having a nice dashboard so you can manage your users roles and permissions.\nThere are so many aspects and yes, technically you could build it yourself, but personally I would not do that.\nI would go with a third-party solution.\nThese are companies that have already developed a lot of these features and you can use them.\nSo, I'm actually a brand ambassador for Kinde.\nIt's a paid sponsorship.\nThey are also sponsoring this video and I had a great time using them so far.\nThis is what I would personally use.\nI would not personally try to build it myself.\nNow, regardless of the solution that you will be using, all of the concepts that we will discuss about authentication will be very similar.\nIt's always about some data that we want to protect and the user gets access to it if they can show some valid JSON web token.\nFor example, there are other mechanisms as well like session IDs.\nIn that case, I have to show a valid session ID.\nBut just to show you how it works with Kinde here.\nYou can find a link in the description by the way if you want to follow along.\nBut with Kinde, I get so many things out of the box.\nI get a nice dashboard where I can see all of my users.\nI can see them here.\nI can manage.\nI can manage them from here.\nSuspend them, delete them, view their profiles.\nI can work with organizations.\nSo you may have multiple people, multiple users that belong to the same organization.\nI get a login page out of the box.\nI can even design that myself and so much more.\nBut let's actually just see how you would set something like this up.\nSo here we need to add an application.\nI can say this is my blog.\nWhat kind of app are we building?\nWell, Next.js is actually more like a backend framework because we have so many backend features as we saw.\nAnd then here we can pick Next.js and save here.\nAll right.\nSo here we have the setup guide.\nWe will go with existing codebase.\nWe already have an app.\nSo we will set these callback URLs.\nYou can just click on set because Kinde needs to know where to send the user back to after they have authenticated for example or logged out.\nOkay, I'm going to install this.\nLet's see.\nRight.\nSo, just run this.\nSo, with environment variables here, I have amp file because I'm using Prisma.\nAnd with Prisma, this is the default file they use.\nBut you will often also see something called .local\nor some other file.\nBasically, this is where we can put some secrets that our app needs to use, like an API key, for example, um or just something that depends on the environment.\nSo, development piece of data that's different in production.\nBut typically, you do want to make sure that these files are going to stay on your computer.\nYou do not accidentally want to push these to GitHub, for example, because they may contain secrets.\nSo, here in Git ignore, you do want to make sure that you have included, right?\nSo, you can see it's grayed out here as well.\nSo I'm going to add those environment variables here to my EMV.\nDon't show them to other people.\nAnd then we need to set up an API endpoint.\nWe need to set up an AP.\nOkay.\nSo I can actually also just do this here.\nSo new file and just paste that entire path like this.\nOkay.\nAnd have and then it works like this.\nCan copy this and paste that in here.\nSo that should be it.\nLet's see.\nYeah.\nSo now we can add login buttons and register button.\nAll right.\nSo let's actually add these to the page.\nSo in this case, let's add it on the homepage.\nlet's say.\nSo we'll go to the homepage and here I will import these buttons and I will just add them right here.\nOkay.\nSo now we will have login and register capability.\nSo now we have this.\nSo if I click on this now let's see what we get.\nAll right.\nSo here we can see we now have a register page u managed by Kinde.\nWe can design this in Kinde in in many ways.\nUm but I like the default actually so I'll keep it.\nNow it's asking me for first name and so on.\nSo here we can actually also decide how a user should be able to register or log in.\nSo let's actually go let's actually go to Kinde here under authentication we can decide how user should be able to log in.\nSo you can see email and code phone or username or social connections.\nLet's actually use GitHub here and let's actually save.\nSo now if I try to log in or register I can also click on continue with GitHub or create a new one here and then continue with GitHub.\nAll right.\nSo then after logging in with GitHub my account is created and I'm actually logged in.\nWhat does that mean when I'm actually logged in?\nWell, now if I go to application here under cookies, I have an access token and you can see this is a so-called JSON web token JWT.\nSo, if a user can show that they have a valid access token, we can grant them access to protected pages or data for example.\nAnd if it's not valid or they don't have one, they're not going to get access.\nThat's basically how it works, right?\nSo, stored in a so-called cookie.\nCookies are automatically sent with every request.\nSo every request that the user's browser makes to our server side is going to have this cookie.\nSo in there we can check if it's a VAT access token.\nThat's basically authentication.\nNow by default Kinde redirects me to /dashboard\nand that's actually something we can change here in the environment variable.\nSo here you can see post login redirect URL.\nActually we do not want /dashboard.\nIt should be /ost.\nLet's actually go back here.\nSo I'm logged in already.\nNow if I go to posts I can see the posts.\nNow of course everyone can still see them.\nWe haven't protected this page yet.\nSo how So now we set it up but how do we actually protect the page?\nLet's actually add a logout button here.\nSo we can actually unauthenticate ourselves as well and we can check how it works.\nLet's actually add it in the header.\nSo here in the header I'm importing this logout link from Kinde and I'm adding it here and I'm using /ash components here for the uh package.\nAnd let's actually make this a little bit smaller.\nOkay.\nSo remember being logged in is basically just it basically just means you have a valid access token in your cookies.\nIf I log out, let's see what happens.\nYou can see when I log out, those are gone now, right?\nSo now I don't have a valid access token here.\nSo I'm not logged in.\nThat's basically what it means.\nSo but now I can still access /ost.\nAnd we want this to be protected.\nSo now let's take a look at how we can protect it.\nSo here is the posts page.\nAnd what are we doing?\nWe're we're reaching out to our database and taking the post out of there.\nBut we only want to do that if the user is actually logged in.\nSo actually before there we want to have a so-called authentication check.\nBasically, we're going to check if that user has a valid access token.\nSo, I'm going to uh use get kind server session.\nWe can use this anywhere on the server side, not only in server components, also in server actions API route and it will allow us to check if that user has a valid access token in the cookies, right?\nSo, it will do that automatically for us and it will let us know if the user is authenticated or not.\nIf that's not the case, we will redirect them to the login page.\nSo it actually has to be the API endpoint that we set up so that Kinde can internally uh wire it up.\nNow with redirect in Next.js it's very tricky but it will actually throw something.\nSo we so basically it should not continue there but if you just if you want to be sure you can add return here.\nSo then if the user is authenticated we will continue and actually fetch the post from the database right but otherwise the user will be redirected to the login page.\nSo now if I'm on the homepage and I try to go to the post page let's see what happens.\nSo you can see I'm here now and indeed I'm being redirected here.\nSo now I have to authenticate myself first before I can see the posts page.\nLet's actually log in here with GitHub and let's see if that still works.\nAll right.\nAnd now you can see I'm logged in and I can view the posts.\nRight?\nIf I log out and I try to go to posts again, I'm redirected to the login page again.\nOkay.\nSo this is a\n\n\nVery simple example.\nOf course, we not only want to check the posts plural page, but also the individual post page, right?\nSo here, before we actually get the data from the database, um, we have another authentication check here as well.\nSo now if I'm logged out, let's actually log out.\nNow if I try to go even manually, let's say to posts with an ID of two, I should be redirected.\nYeah.\nSo now I'm that, so now that is also protected and I have to log in in order to see it.\nUm, when I log in and now try to go to post two, you can see everything still works.\nSo you can see now as the user makes requests to certain pages, we have an authentication check here, right?\nSo there's communication between server and client, right?\nSo now if the user makes a request to the server side, sometimes there will need to be some kind of authentication check, and the way that we've done it now is to do it directly in the server component, so on the page component itself.\nHowever, there is also something called middleware in Next.js.\nSo the way to think about middleware is that we can run something before we do other things on our server.\nSo there's basically like an in-between step, middleware, where so basically if the user is making a request to our server side, it can be a server component or actually a server action as well, or route handlers, we can have some code running before that.\nSo for example, here in the root of the source, I can also create a middleware.ts file, and here I can export a function that will take that incoming request.\nSo we'll get an incoming request here, and before we do other things on our server, here is also where we could check if the user has that valid token here before we do anything else, before we allow it to uh continue.\nAnd so if it's not valid, we can already return out of here and say, yeah, it's you're not logged in and redirect to the login page.\nSo this may be a preferable place to do the authentication check.\nKinde has documentation on this, by the way, um, very clear.\nSo if I just copy their example here, just to see how they uh recommend it, so here you get the incoming request and we can wrap it with this function from Kinde.\nSo it will check if the user has a valid token.\nNow with middleware, we can also decide on which requests it should run, because we may we may want we may want it to run for all requests to the server side, or maybe we can skip it for some path.\nFor example, if the user should always be able to view our logo, right?\nWe do not necessarily want to check for authentication if there is a request for the logo.\nSo there is a matcher that we can specify, and this is the matcher that Kinde uh suggests on their documentation.\nYou may want to double check for your specific use case what the right matcher should be.\nThis is just an example, but this is another place where you could do the authentication check.\nThis is basically how people learn the first time how to do authentication in Next.js.\nTypically, you either do it in middleware or you do it in the page server component.\nNow, personally, there is an even better way.\nIt's with a so-called data access layer.\nIt's a more advanced technique.\nSo, it's outside the scope of this video, but I would argue that the data access layer is the best practice for authentication.\nI would recommend that you look up my other videos on that.\nI did another video with Kinde on a data access layer as well.\nSo I would recommend that you check out that video for a more sophisticated approach.\nAnd now in Kinde here, I can also specify when those tokens should expire, right?\nIf we want to add additional information on that token, we can specify roles and permissions.\nSo I can add a role here.\nMaybe I have some kind of admin user in my app or an editor or right.\nSo on a blog page, we may have an editor role and an editor can create posts, let's say, right?\nSo we can we can work with roles and permissions actually very easy with Kinde.\nI did another video with roles and permissions, check that out.\nSo here we have permissions.\nSo that is basically a modern fullstack Next.js application including authentication with Kinde.\nFor sponsoring the video, check them out.\nYou can find a link in the description.\nI had a great time using them, and yeah, I hope this helps you with understanding modern Next.js.\nThere's a lot to learn, so don't worry.\nDon't worry if you're a little bit confused.\nI have many other videos.\nCheck them out as well.\nAnd then I wish you good luck with your Next.js journey.\nThank you for watching the video and I hope to see you in the next one.\n",
