  "cleanText": "Hey everyone. If you've been building some apps lately, then you probably know that billing is actually still a major pain point. At least for me when I'm building web applications. I would say the biggest pain point I have right now is actually payments or billing. A lot of the other things have been made much easier for me like authentication has been made easier. Next.js itself as a web framework has made a lot of things easier. But I would say when it comes time to restrict access based on some subscription status for the user and I have to build out that whole payment system myself, I still it's still quite a lot of work. So actually in this video I want to introduce you to Kinde's new billing feature. They are also today's sponsor. But with the new Kinde billing feature, this simplifies things so much. So I'm actually really excited to see Kinde going into this direction. So now with Kinde we not only get authentication, we get more broader I would say access management because that is basically also what billing is right? So we want to grant access for example in an application like this where they go to the dashboard this should be gated not only based on their authentication status whether they're logged in, we also want to gate access depending on the subscription plan that they are on. So in this video I want to show you how easy it is to accomplish that with Kinde. Now so when you log into Kinde's dashboard now, you can see the new billing feature here in the list in the navigation here. So with Kinde you get a clean dashboard here where you can manage your users or if you have some kind of B2B application or B2B SaaS, you will have the organizations. We can manage the design of our authentication page. There is releases here right? So feature flags and also workflows and now we also have billing here. So we can set up plans and pricing tables and the user can actually pay and we can grant them access if they are paying subscribers. Really exciting actually because this actually significantly speeds up building out your applications. Let me just show you how it works. So we have some kind of application. We have a public homepage, let's say and this is a Next.js application. So we may have a very simple homepage and we just have one link to the dashboard, right? So in the dashboard is then where we usually have the functionality where the user wants to go, right? So this is you can imagine some kind of SaaS. This is where the actual value of the application is and so right now and so I have a page for that here, dashboard and this is currently still a public page, right? Everybody can just go there, right? So I'm not logged in, I'm not a paying subscriber, I can just go here. So the first step would be to actually restrict this based on the user's authentication status, right? And this is what we've been using Kinde for. Kinde has simplified this a lot as well, right? So here in the Kinde dashboard, I can set up my application here to add authentication. This is my calculator app. I will pick back end here. And here they have an SDK for Next.js. I will save that. We already have an existing app. And if I scroll down here, I just have to set these callback URLs. Boom. Boom. Now we can just copy this and install Kinde. Right. I'm just going to paste this right here. This will install the Kinde Next.js package. Now we can add the Kinde environment variables. I will add that to env.local. You can see after the user has logged in, we are going to redirect them to slash dashboard. Last thing we have to do is add an API endpoint in our application as well. So Kinde can wire everything up internally here. I can just do new file here. Paste that file path and it will create this route handler. Then I can just copy it from here and just paste it right here. This is all I need to do to add authentication to my Next.js application. Way way easier than what we had to do before. I personally would not recommend doing authentication yourself from scratch. I would not do that anymore. There's it's not just username and password. There's so much else and Kinde actually has a great solution. So so I would not do this for myself from scratch anymore. Okay. So then here in the dashboard on this page before we're going to return this to the user. Well, we only want logged in users to access this dashboard page. So we're going to have an authentication check here. You can also do the authentication check in middleware in Next.js. And actually as a best practice I think a dedicated data access layer as it's called I would would be even better but just to demonstrate this we could do it here and we get this function from Kinde. We can use this anywhere on the server side in server components like this one or server actions or route handlers and we can just check if the user is authenticated before we continue and if they're not, we're going to redirect them to the login page. So now if I try going to the dashboard page, you will see what happens. It's not being returned to me. I'm actually being redirected here to Kinde authentication page. Now let's actually add some sign in as well as sign up buttons to the app as well. So here now I can also just click here to sign in or sign up, right? So in this case I would like to sign up. So I'm going to sign up for an account here and here we get the authentication page and we can customize this as well by the way. So here I can go to authentication and I can decide how a user should be able to authenticate. It can be with email and code. Uh in this case, let's go with uh GitHub here. You can imagine building out all of this yourself. There's so much work. And with here, it's just literally just checking some checkbox. So, let's actually save this. And now when I go back to the authentication page, I also have an option for GitHub here. Okay. So, I'm going to use my GitHub account here. All right. And then I am actually being redirected to the dashboard. So, now I am logged in, which basically means I have a valid access token now. So, which is actually stored in my cookies. So if I go to cookies here, you can see I have an access token here, a JSON web token. This is what allows me as a user to access this page right now, right? So these tokens are coming from Kinde. That's all taken care of for us. All right. So now we are restricting access to this dashboard here by checking if they are logged in, basically if they have a valid access token. But let's say that's not enough. We actually only want to grant them access here to the functionality. Let's say we're building a calculator. Maybe we have some special calculator that they want to use and we only want to allow them to use it if they are actually paying subscribers. So now I would have to build out my payment solution. A lot of work, a lot of hassle. So now I can use Kinde for billing here. You'll see how easy it is. There are three things we have to do. First, we have to decide on the plans that we're going to have. So you can imagine a Plus Plan and then a Pro Plan for all the features. Each plan will have a price. We're going to set up those details in the Kinde dashboard. And then step two is to actually give the user some kind of UI interface so they can actually pay. Kinde makes this easy as well, right? So an actual payment page with a pricing table where they can view the plans and the prices. And after they paid, step three is when we have to fulfill the order, right? So we actually have to grant them access. Kinde under the hood will use Stripe. So we do need a Stripe account and we need to link that here in Kinde. So here in the Kinde dashboard if you go to settings here, here you will also see an option for billing and you can connect your Stripe account there. All right. So let's start with step one here in the dashboard. We can go to billing and here we can set up the plans. Now I've already been using the billing feature so I already have some data here but typically you would start here with a new group. So for the calculator app we may have two plans, let's say a Plus Plan and a Pro Plan and we need to group them together. So we're going to group them in a plan group. We're just going to say calculator group. All right. So then here we have to pick do we have users basically individuals or do we have organizations? So if you have some kind of B2B SaaS application where companies are your customers, you would have organizations. However, in let's say a calculator app, it's going to be individuals. It's going to be a B2C application. All right. So we have some colors here as well for the design. But let's actually save this. All right. So then I have a group here. Okay. So now we need to add those two plans. I'm going to add the plan here. This is the first plan. It will belong to this calculator group. Let's give it a name. Calculator Plus Plan. Calculator Plus Plan. I'll just keep it a bit easy here. This is what you can use in your code. Calculator Plus Plan. Okay. Right. So then here for the Plus Plan, we can decide the pricing and the features they should have access to. So let's actually scroll down a little bit and see what are the options that we can add here. So first you have the fixed charges. So this is a charge that is going to apply if they're on the plan. So a charge is also something that we have to give a name and and uh basically treat as a separate entity here. So the charge could be uh we can just call it Plus Plan charge. We can also give it a name which they may see on the invoice. We can say something like calculator app Plus Plan and the price. So let's say this is $9 per month. Let's say I'm going to save here. So now you can see the Plus Plan has a pricing of $9 per month. All right. So then here we can specify the features that the user gets when they are on that plan. So I'm going to add a feature here. Now a feature can be unmetered. So basically unlimited or they can be metered. And especially if you're building an AI app these days, you may for example uh have something that should be priced on the amount of tokens that they use for example, right? So in that case you would perhaps want to use the metered option here. In our case, we're just going to allow them access to some calculator and it's going to be unlimited access. So, I'm just going to say unmetered. So, the feature that they will get access to on the Plus Plan is let's say calculator adding and subtracting, right? So, they can add numbers and they can subtract numbers, right? Super simple example of course to add and subtract numbers. Okay? And key. Okay. We can say adding subtracting and the type. Okay. Okay, I will save that right here. That is the one feature basically that they will get access to. Okay, so I'm I can save it as a draft if I want or I can already go ahead and publish this. I will actually publish this so they can actually view it in a second. But before we do that, we actually want to add another plan. So I can go back here. You can see we now have one plan, the Calculator Plus Plan. But we also have a we also want to have a Pro Plan. So we can go here and we can say Calculator Pro Plan. Okay. Calculator Pro Plan. Calculator Pro Plan. So, let's go ahead. All right. So, here we have the Pro Plan. This is like the most premium offering that we will have. And this is going to be uh calculator Pro Plan. And this is going to be let's say $19, right? So, we want to have this be $19. A little bit more expensive because if we save here, what are the features that they're going to get access to? Well, they will also get access to that adding and subtracting feature. So, we can already add that one. I will add it right here. So now they also get access to adding and subtracting but they get an additional feature which is uh multiplication and division. So they can also multiply and divide numbers also in metered multiplication and division. Multiply divide. So now this Pro Plan has two. So now this Pro Plan has an additional feature here. Okay. I'm going to save it and I will also go ahead and publish this. Okay. So now we have two plans and I will go ahead and make this group. So these plans I'm going to make this the default. So when a user comes to our app, this is going to be the default set of options they will get. Okay. So these are basically the plans. Now we can go and head here to the pricing table, right? So our users will sign up and they will pick from this pricing table. We can generate based on that group that we just created. And this was the calculator group that we just created, right? So here we have our pricing table. We can edit it right here. And this is what we want to make. Well, let's actually make it live and uh so the user can actually pay in a second. So these are the plans that are part of the pricing table. Now we can change the content. Let me actually save here first. Let's actually add the content here or change the content if we want. So this is the content that the user will actually see. So this is going to be for the Plus Plan. What the user will see may should just be like Plus Plan. Uh we can give it a description. The what the button should display. The features. So we can actually say that the feature here that we want to list will be add and subtract numbers. Add and subtract numbers. We can add a highlight label if we want for basic work. Maybe I will save that. And now for the Pro Plan uh we can say for the features it's going to be adding and subtracting, multiplying and dividing or for serious workloads. Okay. So I will save that. And if I go back to details here under plans, we can also mark this to be highlighted actually. So we can also move. So let's actually highlight this as well. Okay, it's going to be highlighted. So now we have all of this set up. Now when a user signs up, they will actually see a pricing page. Let's actually remove the user I just created. So I can sign up again and we can see what a user will see. And then I will sign out here to remove the access token. So now if I go here to to dashboard, you can see that it's not going to render anything. It's actually just going to redirect me to the login page here. So, first we do have to authenticate. That's fine. I will create an account here with my GitHub account actually again. And now before redirecting me to the dashboard, it's showing me this pricing table. So here you can see the Plus Plan and the Pro Plan. Okay. So I did I did accidentally change the name here, but you\n\nCan customize this in many different ways. This one gives me one more feature. So yeah, let's actually say I do want to go with the Pro Plan. I will click on choose plan. Let's see what we get. All right. Right. So then here I get a pricing page and I can pay here with my credit card. So I will just go ahead and actually do that. So now if I actually go to my Stripe dashboard, I can actually see that there is a subscription here and you can see Kinde is synchronizing a bunch of data with Stripe here. So you can still see the data here in the Stripe dashboard as well. And you can see here that there is one new subscriber here and they have bought the calculator Pro and they are subscribed for $19 per month. Right? So this is now a paying subscriber. But now fulfillment, how can we actually check that to make sure before we allow access? Because right now we are actually only checking if the user is logged in. But we also need to have some well authorization check or plan check, right? So how would you do that here? How would you actually fulfill? Well, we can fulfill the order of the user in different ways actually. So when a user signs up, Kinde will actually also send us a webhook and our app can then for example assign a role to the user. For example, a Pro user. Kinde makes it very easy to deal with roles and permission. So here under roles and permissions I could perhaps create a Plus membership role or a Pro membership role and then when the user pays, we're just going to assign them the appropriate role. When they want to get access, we can check for that role. That's one way we can go here. But Kinde actually also offers an account API. So we can also just ask Kinde, hey, is this user on a particular plan? Right? So here if I go to the Kinde dashboard, we can see our users right here. So here we have that one user. We can actually view more information about them here. And one of those things is actually their billing status here as well. So you can see here there is a user and they are on the Pro Plan, right? So, so I can see that here in the dashboard, but I can also make an API call from my app to Kinde to ask about this user. So, here for example, um once I'm logged in, we can also just get the access token and I can make an API call to Kinde and I can ask about that user. So, I do need to use the access token from the user and we will get some response and in the payload there will actually be information about the plans that they are on. Let's actually log what we get here from Kinde. So Kinde will actually give us plans and entitlements, basically the features. So if I actually refresh here what we get here is the following. So we get a bunch of data here and among them the entitlement. Uh here you can see there is the Pro Plan but here we get also plans. So this user is on the calculator Pro Plan right? So you do need to use that key in the app. So in this case we would check for that and otherwise we can check for the Plus Plan or other plans we may have. Okay. So then we know the plan that the user is on. If they are not on any plan, right? If that is possible, we actually right it's actually safer to assume that this is undefined. So after this, if there is no plan, we're actually also going to redirect them, right? And only after that do we know that the user is on some plan and can we give them access to well the functionality that that they are paying for. So, for example, we may have a component for the Pro Plan, which is the one that we want to render when the user is on the Pro Plan. If they're on the Plus Plan, we're going to render the Plus version of the calculator. And so now here, I'm on the Pro Plan. So, what I see here is the calculator for that Pro, the Pro Plan. And what I can do here is I can multiply numbers, right? So, here, calculate, I get a result here. And I can see I have the Pro features unlocked. So, I now have full access to the calculator plan. Now what if I want to change my plan? There is also an option here to manage subscription. Let me actually click on that and see what we get. We will actually get a page here also from Kinde where the user can self-serve their information here. So they have some profile information here but also for the plan that they are on. They can also change their plan. So let's say uh $19. It's a bit much. Let's actually downgrade here to a Plus Plan. So I'm going to So now I'm on the Plus Plan. Here I can also see my payment details like my credit card. And now if I go back to the app, if I go to dashboard now I'm on the Plus Plan, right? And the Plus Plan only gives me adding and subtracting, right? And you can see here I have Pro features available. I'm making some promotion here. So so the user may want to uh upgrade, right? So we have manage subscription here as well. So how do you get that self-serve portal? Well, Kinde makes that super easy actually. It's just this portal link component, right? So you can just import that from uh Kinde here. It's one of the components that they have and that will redirect them to that URL for that self-serve portal where they can manage information about their profile. Now what the user is able to do here you can also specify in the Kinde dashboard actually. So here under settings if I go to uh self-serve portal here I can specify some settings. So here, user self-management, can I I allow users to change their profile information as well as their billing information. Okay, if you have a B2B application, there's also an option here for organizations, right? And if I do want to change my plan again, I want to upgrade to Pro Plan, I can choose that plan again. If I go to the Stripe dashboard, you can see I have one subscription here in my app and they are now on the $9 on the $9 plan because I just downgraded. So there you go. We now have authentication in a minute or two and now we also have billing in just a matter of minutes as well. I think it's really amazing. So, make sure you check out Kinde. You can find a link in the description and yeah, great job. I think it's an amazing feature. I'm really excited to see Kinde taking this direction. Well done to the Kinde team. I hope that you enjoyed it as well. Hopefully, it helps you out with building your apps. But I think this is going to be the future of software development. you can focus on the features that really make your app differentiated from the other apps in the marketplace.
