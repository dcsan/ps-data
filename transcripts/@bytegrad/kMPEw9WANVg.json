  "cleanText": "Well, it's pretty crazy seeing you talk. I know it's a bit surreal, right? But I'm glad we can have a conversation like this. It feels pretty natural. What do you think about the whole video call thing? Is it something you're used to or is it still a bit weird for you? It's actually really weird to see this. I can imagine it's not every day you get to see someone react to what you're saying in real time like this. You seem pretty calm and engaged, by the way. That smile on your face is reassuring. It makes the conversation feel more natural. Thanks. I appreciate it. Thanks for the call and see you in the next tutoring session.\n\nHey everyone, in this video I want to show you what is probably the most impressive AI tool that I have come across so far and it has to do with videos and voice. If you wanted to create videos, previously you had to record a video yourself and it's a lot of work. But with the solution that I'm going to show you in a second, I can just write a script and the service I'm going to use will generate the video for me with a person in the video. So it will look like a realistic person actually talking the script. And then we're going to take it a step further and actually talk live with an AI tutor. So it will be a video with somebody in there with an AI avatar basically in there. It looks very realistic. I'm actually generally surprised how good this is. So the service I'm using here is called Tavus. They are also today's sponsor and they recently released their Fenix 3 model and this has really crossed the uncanny valley in my personal opinion. Before I explain more about Tavus, let me just show you this. So let's say we have a script here. Maybe I want to create a tutorial video about some topic or maybe I want to help somebody get on boarded on the team, right? So you have a new person on the team. They need to be onboarded. So you need to explain how things work in the company. I want to have a video for that instead of recording it myself. So much work. I'm going to click on generate tutorial video. We just have to wait like 2 minutes or something like that. You can see it's already generating now and I'll get back to you when it's finished. All right. And after a couple minutes, we actually have a video here. And do you recognize this person? This is actually me. I trained, I cloned myself actually. And then I can use that. It's called a replica. I can use that to generate video. So I put in this script. Let's see how it did. Welcome to the team. Here's a quick tour of how we build, ship, and support code so you can start contributing with confidence from day one. In this video, you'll meet the people and tools that keep our engineering flow smooth from daily stand-ups and our git workflow to automated tests. By the way, look at how good the lip sync is. I have not seen any other kind of AI avatar that has lip sync at this quality. So, if you look at the text, it actually matches up almost perfectly. CI/CD pipelines and the Slack channels where questions get answered fast. By the end, you'll know exactly where to find docs, who to ping. So, I've already generated a few videos, so I'm already used to it. But it was really crazy to see myself actually saying things that I just typed here. So, really amazing. Yeah, just really good, high quality. And yeah, I can now generate videos by just writing text essentially. So if I want to create tutorial videos here, maybe about computer science or explainer videos for other context, I don't have to record it myself. I just write the text and Tavus will generate the video for me. You don't have to clone yourself. By the way, Tavus offers some standard replicas, basically AI avatars in their library as well. So if you just quickly want to get started and just try it out, you can use those. But you can also upload your own video and then actually clone that and create a replica out of yourself. So you can see both the video as well as the voice and the lip sync. It's all really good. But it gets even better. Now let's say I actually want to have a live conversation. So let me actually refresh here. I want to have a conversation with this person. So let's actually try it out. I can connect here. It will actually open up a room here. And let's say I want to be tutored, right? So you can have some kind of tutoring application. And you can see me talking right now. And I'm going to join the chat room here. And there's going to be a tutor joining me. So, let's actually see what happens. All right. So, hey, how you doing?\n\nI'm doing great. Thanks for asking. How about you? I'm doing well. Can you explain to me big O notation?\n\nBig O notation is like a way to measure how long an algorithm takes to run. It's a way to talk about how fast or slow it is. Want me to break it down? Yes. Maybe give an example of big O notation. Why? Why? Why is this relevant?\n\nSo big on notation is relevant because it helps us. By the way, please wait wait wait wait wait. Can you give one quick practical example in web development like when you're dealing with a huge database of users and you need to find a specific user if your algorithm is Owen, it's going to take a long time if you have millions of users. But if it's wait one minute, right? So by the way, you can see as I'm interrupting the speaker, the replica actually stops talking. Could you explain to me how hash tables work under the hood?\n\nSo, hash tables, they're like a data structure that lets you store and look up key value pairs super fast. Basically, when you put a key in, it uses a hash function to generate an index and then it stores the value that in there. Thanks. Very good. Glad I can you Thanks. I'm glad we\n\nGo ahead. What? What?\n\nSo, is there something specific you'd like to talk about or ask, or are you just enjoying the conversation?\n\nWell, it's pretty crazy seeing you talk. I know it's a bit surreal, right? But I'm glad we can have a conversation like this. It feels pretty natural. What do you think about the whole video call thing? Is it something you're used to or is it still a bit weird for you? It's actually really weird to see this. I can imagine it's not every day you get to see someone react to what you're saying in real time like this. You seem pretty calm and engaged. By the way, that smile on your face is reassuring. It makes the conversation feel more natural. Thanks. I appreciate it. Thanks for the call and see you in the next tutoring session.\n\nYou're welcome. It was a pleasure chatting with you and helping you understand big on notation and hashts. I'll catch you in the next session. Have a great day and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions before then. All right. Thanks. Bye. So, you can see how good that was. Really feels like you're talking to a real human and actually it's just crazy to see this. You can see the facial expressions really good. Lip sync is really good. When you interrupt the replica, it actually will stop. It will actually stop talking almost immediately. So, it has a very fast response essentially to what you are doing. And that makes it feel very realistic. So, yeah, well done to the Tavus team. So, some of the applications you may be building with this are for example, well, any kind of tutoring type of app. Imagine a language learning app and you want to allow your user to to talk like this to practice or learn a language. Or maybe you have some kind of marketing app. You want to generate a personalized video for a new user. Or you just want to create explainer type of videos for let's say onboarding or maybe some kind of teley health teley health application. There's so many things that we can build with this. So, I'm just amazed at at what we can do these days with AI. So, let me actually show you how we can set it up and how you can build applications with generating videos, maybe some kind of live call functionality. And you'll see it's actually very easy. This is not we don't need to do a lot of engineering to get this. Actually, I was actually surprised as well at how easy it was to set everything up. All right, so here I'm in the dashboard and for these videos, it's all about these replicas. So, they have a lot of stock replicas. So, if you just quickly want to try it out, make sure to check out the link in the description and just use one of the stock replicas. You can generate videos very fast and have a conversation like this very fast as well. But a lot of you are going to be interested in actually cloning, actually creating your own replica. So, what you can do here is you can go to create replica and basically you need to upload a video or a few videos and from there Tavus can generate that replica for you. So, they have some tips here so you can just it's recorded. I have I just had to record myself for around 2 minutes or so and you have to give your consent of course once you've uploaded that video and they'll walk you through it here and then within a few hours actually it was pretty fast the replica will be ready for you. So I just recorded myself in this room and from there they were able to generate the replica and they will have some standard video here. So then you have the replica and you can use the ID. So I can copy the ID and you can add the ID number here to your environment variables in case building an app. All right. So then you have either a stock replica or your own one. So now let's say you actually want to generate a video. So here there is an option for video generation. And here you can pick a replica that you want to use in the video. So in this case of course I have my own replica but you can pick one of the stock options as well. And here I can write my text and I can generate a video from the dashboard here in Tavus if I want. If you quickly want to try it out, I would recommend using the link in the description using one of the stock replicas and then here you can use it with AI just a random script and you can just check how good it is. It's just going to generate, going to take a few minutes and I'll get back to you once this one is finished. All right. And after a couple minutes it's finished and then you can check out the video like this. You start up drowning in data. Our analytics platform turns big data into big insights from predictive modeling to real. So there you go. Let me actually stop it. By the way, you can also delete the videos if you want. So if it if you don't like it, you can just delete it. But of course, we want to be able to generate it programmatically in our app, let's say, not just manually in the dashboard. So how do you create a feature like that here? Let's actually take a look at the code I have for this. The user will have some kind of text area to actually input the script, right? So I just have a text area here and we are keeping track of that here. And ultimately when the user submits the form, we are going to send that to our back end. Right? So here I'm just making a simple fetch call to my back end here an API an API endpoint actually. All right. So then here this API endpoint will get that incoming request with the script. So we get the body like this and then we're actually going to make an API call to Tavus and we and we will pass along the actual script but also the ID of the replica that we want to use in the video. Right? And the actual fetch call happens here. This is you I'm using the v2 API endpoint here from Tavus. So it's going to be slash video this complete path here. And I have an API key from Tavus as well. You can find that in the dashboard as well. So if I do that, if I just say hello world, that's what that's what happens basically when I just press the button here. So it's just going to fire off that API call to Tavus with the script and Tavus will eventually cue that and start generating. Now you can see the status here gets updated and that's because we just pull Tavus for these update. Right? So here I have another API endpoint. So Tavus will give us an ID and so we can keep asking Tavus, hey are you ready yet? Are you ready yet? So every every few seconds I'm making another API call to Tavus with the video ID asking it for status update. Eventually it will be complete but in the meantime it's going to show generating but eventually when it's finished it will actually have multiple URLs. So there may be a stream URL, a download URL. So depending on how you want to consume the video, they have options for that. They have a hosted page as well by the way. So let's actually wait for this one to finish. All right. So after a few minutes it will actually be finished and my server will then send that back to the front end and we will set the video URL actually starting from using the download URL actually and then I can just use a simple video tag here on the page to actually display the video. Okay, I'm adding controls here and auto play as well. And that's the result and the result that we get is this. So actually very easy and great result. All right, now what about the tutoring session here? So now we actually want to have a live conversation. Let me actually refresh here. So in this case, I recommend that you also take a look at the persona library because just because we have a replica, they do not have like a personality yet. We can set up a personality for them. So here in create persona, I can pick the replica. So that's me. And then I can specify a role. So this could be CS tutor, right? Or if you have a language learning app, it would be a language tutor, let's say. So then you can specify a system prompt for them. So this would be this would basically be their personality. We can tell them hey your role is to be well a good CS tutor and you want to be very helpful and have be patient. If a user doesn't understand something and so really craft a personality for them and if you have some context there some basically some knowledge that they need to know about we can add that here as well as the conversational content. Okay. So the LLM that they are using here. We can even specify that. So Tavus has some default options here which\n\n\nI'm just using, I didn't change anything here.\nSo, the default option in my view is actually already good for they have their raven model here, percepting how basically you are talking to them.\nSo, for example, the replica can pick up on your uh facial expressions as well.\nI had some good results with that as well.\nSo, speech to text and also text to speech here.\nI just left the default options and I had great results.\nSo, they also have a persona library here with some default options.\nSo, you don't have to craft it completely from scratch.\nYou can also just take a look at the examples.\nOkay.\nSo, then to start an actual video session with that replica, when I click on this button, I'm also making a fetch call to the server side.\nThat is this API endpoint here.\nAnd in here, we're just making an API call to Tavus.\nAgain, here we need to specify which replica we want to have a conversation with, right?\nSo, I put it in my environment variable, but you will have to store this somewhere.\nYou may have conversational context.\nSo, maybe in a language learning app, you the user was already chatting before in text, maybe you want to attach that so that it knows the previous context, for example.\nUm, we have some properties here.\nSo, we can enable recording, enable closed cap.\nSo, I'm actually using this utility function.\nSo, it's going to be uh the Tavus API uh this path and using my API key again.\nThen, then it's going to be as easy as just clicking the button here.\nIt will just fire off an API call.\nAnd here I am.\nSo, this is my, this is what you see here.\nSo, it just fired off that API call to Tavus.\nNow, on the front end to actually display that, I am actually just using an iframe here.\nSo, Tavus will give you a conversation URL, and that's what you can use as the source.\nOkay.\nAnd then uh this is what you get actually.\nSo, you don't have to set up a lot here.\nJust an iframe and a URL.\nThis is my view as I'm talking right now.\nSo, if I join this, you will see the actual tutor uh joining the call here, right?\nSo, hey, how you doing?\nI'm doing great.\nThanks for joining the call.\nHow about you?\nThanks.\nBye.\nSo, that was the conversation.\nYou can also finish it, of course, actually.\nYeah, really great results and also not difficult to set up at all.\nVery easy.\nThat's a conversation that I just had.\nSo, I can go to conversation library here.\nAnd here you will get an overview of the conversations you had.\nWhat I can also do here is actually, I can also uh end it here, but I actually, but I can also delete it here.\nIf you want to see the full list of options you have, make sure to check out the API documentation here.\nSo, for a conversation like that, let's take a look at the other options you have.\nSo, of course, you need to specify which replica and actually also the persona ID.\nSo, if you want to use a particular personality, make sure to specify that ID as well.\nActually can also be voice only.\nSo, if you just want to have audio and let's see, we have some other ones as well.\nEven a custom greeting.\nSo, if you just want to have it open with a particular greeting.\nAnd so here for the properties, we can also specify how long it should take and a lot of other options as well.\nSo, so pretty uh sophisticated API here and I can create a replica also programmatically by the way.\nSo, you can also upload a video here to create a replica and uh do a lot of this programmatically actually.\nRight.\nSo, generating video as we saw in the beginning, we have many options here as well.\nAlso an option here for background if you want a watermark on the video.\nUm, some other background options here as well.\nYou can also generate speech or create some lip sync.\nSo, if you already have a video and you want to and you want the lips to be synced with some audio, that is something that you may want to try here as well.\nSo, really impressive and I'm actually really excited to see what you will be building with this.\nMake sure to check out Tavus with the link in the description.\nI want to thank Tavus for sponsoring the video and I want to thank you for watching.\nHope to see you in the next one.\nBye.\n",
