  "cleanText": "Hey everyone, I know a lot of you are familiar with WordPress, and in this video, I actually want to talk about how we can use WordPress in this age of AI, Vibe Coding, and some of the things that you can do with that because I actually think it is a really interesting development in the world of coding, and especially for people that are familiar with, let's say, a CMS like WordPress, maybe not as code savvy as a professional developer.\n\nSo, if you are familiar with WordPress but not code savvy, previously, if you wanted to build a Plugin for WordPress, let's say you had to know a lot about code and the technical details. Same if you wanted to build some Theme, if you wanted to build a Custom Frontend with WordPress as the backend headless CMS, you had to know a lot about, let's say, React or Next.js. But these days with AI, AI can implement a lot of that code, a lot of those technical details are taken care of by AI. So I actually think it lowers the barrier for people that already have some domain knowledge in something else to get into the realm of code and build useful things. You have an itch to scratch. Maybe you've always wanted to build some Plugin, but you just didn't know enough about code or the technical details. Well, I would say you can give it a shot now because with these AI coding pilots, it is actually very doable, I think, to build a lot of things even without knowing a lot about code. Of course, it does help a lot if you do know code and all of the tech technical details. So, it's not like if you have the coding knowledge and the technical details knowledge that all of that is going away. It's still very useful to know that, but it does lower the barrier to entry for people that don't know as much about it, which I think is a good development. I think a lot of useful things can be built now that previously was just constraints.\n\nSo, let's actually talk about how this would work, and I'll actually show you how to build a Custom Frontend. We're going to use Next.js. So let's actually talk a little bit about this and how this works in practice. So where do you start with this AI coding hype? If you want to build a Plugin or Theme or Custom Frontend, you probably do need to be able to easily work with the code, and you probably need a complete development environment as it's called. So these so-called code editors or IDE, integrated development environment. Some of the popular ones that have integrated a lot of these AI features are Cursor and Windsurf and also GitHub Copilot, which is sitting in Visual Studio Code. So Visual Studio Code now also has this agent mode with GitHub Copilot. So these are all really good, and this is a more sophisticated setup, and that's what I will show you in this video. Now there is a different category of these AI-tools as well that you will see all the time. These are lovable bolt new and also v0ero apps. You can chat basically in their environment, and you can do a lot of things. I think you can do some of these things as well, especially creating a front end, it can be done here as well. So that may be something you want to use. However, if you want to get a little bit more sophisticated, I personally do find that at some point you do have to go into an actual code editor and actual IDE. So that is what I will show you in this video.\n\nWhat does it actually look like? Well, here I have my Visual Studio Code, and in here I have the GitHub Copilot extension. So, I opened up a folder on my computer. I called it WordPress. And now I can type something like this. Now, there are three modes in ask mode here. Now, these and this is Visual Studio Code by the way, but it works very similarly in the other code editors. I can say something like this. And in ask mode, it's just going to return an answer in text for me. It will not actually change the code. In edit mode, it will actually change code. But agent mode is the most sophisticated. It will try to do more than just a simple task. It may edit multiple files, or it may just ask you, or it may just answer your question without editing files. So typically I'm in agent mode. And then you have the actual AI models under the hood that you want it to use. So you can see there's Open AI with GPT in 04. There is Google here with Gemini. And then there is Antropic with cloth set. And actually version four here is the latest one. So let me just use that and instead of building a WordPress Plugin, we can say set up a WordPress Plugin development environment, right? Just getting started.\n\nOkay, so what it will do is it will create files. If I open up the project here, you can see I opened a folder on my computer here, WordPress, but there are currently no files in here. So if I hand off this task to this AI agent, it will create, it will set up an environment, basically a bunch of files so I can get started with building the Plugin, and you can see it will give you some output on what it's doing. So it says I'll help you build, I'll help you set up an environment. Let me first check the current state of the workspace. So it will actually already check if there is something there. Okay. And now it has sort of a plan first. It's going to do a WordPress core installation. It will have some default structure and then an actual local setup. Okay. So now it has already created a bunch of folders and files. And this may take a couple minutes. So, you may just browse the web or do something else in the meantime. Basically, you're handing off these tasks to an AI agent, and they're going to implement it, and after a minute or 2 minutes, you will come back and see what it's done. All right. So, after a minute or so, we have a bunch of files here. So, in this case, the code, the core of it at least, will mostly be in this one file here, my first Plugin. Now, if you're not familiar with code, this is going to look overwhelming and scary. So, the idea here is that you don't have to write much of the code yourself. You're going to just describe in natural language here to the AI agent what you want to do. So, I could continue chatting here. Now, I do like to often clear all of this context and just start a new chat if I have a new topic. So, here I would like to change the, let's say, the text on the admin page. So I could, instead of changing the code, I would do something like add a heading to the admin page saying hello world, right? So I just chat with the agent here, and the agent will implement in code on my behalf. Okay, you can see now it has changed the code here, even if I don't know much about PHP, sometimes it will still be, it will, it's still clear to me what's clear to me what changed. So I can keep it, I can change the code here, and now I updated my Plugin. I can do the same with Themes. If I want to develop my own Custom Theme, I can clear out of this. Let me actually just remove everything here, and I can just say please set up WordPress Theme development environment. Also, just getting started.\n\nAll right. So, now I can just grab a coffee or something and come back and see what's done. All right. So, you can see this one actually took a little bit longer cuz there's way more going on here. From here, I could change the code by just typing like I showed you before. Even if you don't know much about PHP or HTML or CSS or JavaScript, I think you can still do a lot here. And yeah, that's really the game changer that AI is bringing, it has allowed, it allows you, even if you don't know much about the technical details, to still be, uh, to still create useful things. So I think that's really exciting actually. It opens up the market for a lot of more, for a lot more people, right? So I could say something like add a copyright statement, right? I don't have to manually dig into the code here, and I can just let my agent take care of it. So here you can see it has made some changes. What you see in the red is what it removed, and the green stuff is what it has added. It works very similarly in Cursor by the way. So if you're using Cursor, very similar actually. So this is actually Cursor. I opened up the same project in Cursor here. And here they also have an AI pane here. So the interface is slightly different here, but the underlying models are very similar. The way that I would iterate over the project is also very similar. Now, how does an agent like this know the style to follow? Well, you can add instructions for these AI agents as well. So, here in Cursor, I can add Cursor settings. I can go to Cursor settings here. And here under rules, I can add something for this particular project only. So, I can say add rules. I can say this is for WordPress. And here I can now specify some rules. So, I want these to always be included. So if I give a task to the agent, let's say I always want this text here to be included. And there are some people online, you can find various websites that have already come up with some decent rules out of the box. So just to show you one of these as an example here, you can see it. This is what's going to be included now whenever you hand off a task to the agent. So it's going to be something like this. All right. So you can also specify the PHP version. This depends on how you want to host it, of course, and a lot of the other style things that you want it to follow and best practices. So this may be something you want to include as well. In Cursor, it's dotcursor/ruules and then it's an mdc file as of recording at least. In Visual Studio Code, it's there's something similar. It's GitHub and then it's copilot instructions.m MD. I can also include all those instructions. These should be automatically included. So now if I hand off a task to the agent here, all of this is included. You probably don't want to make the fonts too big because it may pollute the context a bit too much. But I think this is still an acceptable length, and this may help you hone in on the style that the agent will come up with. And some other important things like if you really need a particular PHP version or some features, technical features that it really needs to use or avoid, perhaps this would be a place to add that.\n\nNow personally, I'm actually mostly excited about the ability to create Custom Frontend. So previously, if you want to build a website, you, and you were not code savvy with React or Next.js, you were kind of boxed in with the whole WordPress front end. However, if you, however, you may want to build something that is based on React or Next.js, maybe an interactive application or a more sophisticated website, a c, you maybe you want to customize an already existing website with some React or Next.js features. In that case, you may want to use WordPress as the back end as the CMS in the back end, but you want to use a different technology like React or Next.js on the front end. And previously, if you're not code savvy, that would be too much. However, with this, I think this is way more realistic as well. So, I can have a Next.js front end UI that will draw in the data, my WordPress CMS, let's say. Right. So, this is basically my back end, and we can work with WordPress in sort of a headless CMS. Let me actually show you how this would work. So, I'm actually going to set up an actual WordPress instance, and I'm going to use Cloudways for this. They are also today's sponsor. I had a great time using them, and they are actually a Digital Ocean company, and they actually make it very easy to spin up a WordPress instance and host it, and it actually is a really powerful platform. All right, so here in the dashboard, I can set up a server here, and then on that server, I can have multiple applications like a WordPress app or even multiple, but starts with a server. So let's actually see how we can set up a server here, and if you want to follow along by the way, you can find a link in the description. All right, so let's actually set up a server here. What's the first application we want to install on there? Well, it will just be a WordPress, the standard version. I will just go with that option. I will say I'll call it first app and first server. All right. So, actually it's a Digital Ocean company, but they do allow us to pick a server from these providers as well. So, if you do prefer Foldure or Linenote, AWS or Google Cloud, you can do that as well. However, I've tried using Digital Ocean, and it was working perfectly fine for me. So, I will just go with that. Now the server type, I can go with a basic one, but maybe you have a more specialized need here. Here we can specify the performance of the server. I will just go with four. I will just leave all the defaults, and I can also pick a location here. Okay. So I will actually launch this, and this may take a couple minutes, and this may take a few minutes. Right. So we just have to wait a little bit. All right. So after a couple minutes, our server here is ready to go. If we click on there, we can configure all of the server-related settings here. So backups, we have monitoring here. We can scale things up or down. But we want to go to our actual application. So here under applications, it has already installed the first WordPress instance here as well. So we can also configure the settings for that particular application here. And before we continue, I quickly want to give a shout out to Cloudways upcoming event, your digital agency in the age of AI. Okay, so AI is changing everything, including Web development, Web design, how to run your agency. So check out this event with the link in the description. It's going to be a live interactive format, roundts as well and networking rooms, and there will be agency leaders and AI professionals who will share their tactics. So if you're interested, make sure to check out the link in the description. But let's actually go to our WordPress admin dashboard here. So they give us a URL with a default template here. If we go here to access details, we can see the actual admin panel. So by default, it has created an account for the admin panel with your Email and a password. Let's actually try logging in. So that is my Email, and then here the password, I can just copy and just log in here. All right. So here we're in the WordPress admin dashboard panel, and to showcase how we can use this as sort of like a headless CMS, let's actually add some content so that we can then consume that content in our\n\n\nCustom frontend with React or Next.js.\nSo I will actually just add some posts here.\nWe already have one here, but let's add a new one.\nSo here we can still work inside WordPress, right?\nSo we can uh work with this editor here, just like maybe you're already used to, or maybe your clients are already used to.\nSo we don't have to change this.\nThis can just be the place where we actually edit.\nThis is the second post, and I will just publish this, the second post.\nAnd let's actually add one more.\nSo we'll say third post here as well.\nThird post.\nAmazing.\nThird post here.\nOkay.\nI will publish this.\nOkay.\nSo now we have content inside our actual WordPress application, inside our actual WordPress instance here.\nAnd this is just a post.\nWe can add many other types of content.\nIf you're building some kind of quiz app, you may want to manage the content of the quiz, right?\nThe questions and the answers inside WordPress.\nOr if you're building some kind of magazine website with a custom Next.js front end, you can still manage all of the content for the magazine, all the posts in here, all the articles in here as well, right?\nSo, we have our URL.\nThis is our URL that we got from Cloudways.\nHow can I now use this in a custom Next.js front end?\nSet up a custom Next.js app and then pull in that content from the WordPress instance.\nHow can we do that?\nWell, let's actually try using AI for this.\nAgain, I will delete all of this.\nAnd now I want to set up, let's say, a Next.js project.\nWe can just say uh set up a Next.js app project.\nLet's see what it does.\nSo, it's going to look at what we already have.\nWell, I just deleted everything.\nSo, it's going to be empty.\nAnd then it's going to generate a plan.\nIt wants to run a terminal.\nIt wants to run a command in the terminal.\nSo for some of these things that an agent wants to do, it will ask you permission in order to do something.\nSo especially for terminal commands where it may accidentally do something wrong, it's going to ask permission.\nSo in this case, we will just allow this.\nSo in this case, I do have to go to through a setup wizard, I will just stick with all the detail, all the standard answers here.\nJust press enter to enter.\nOkay, so looks like it's uh finishing.\nTook a couple minutes, but I'm actually a more experienced Next.js developer, and actually it looks good.\nSo the setup here actually looks very similar to how I would set it up myself manually.\nSo all right, so after a couple minutes, we have our Next.js project ready to go, and it has actually already started a development server as well, meaning we can see the actual project on this URL.\nSo if I open this up, we see our Next.js application, and this is the default boiler plate that you get with a Next.js app setup.\nHowever, of course, we want to use the posts from our WordPress instance in our app.\nSo, we want to have maybe a magazine website or news website or whatever.\nNot this, of course.\nSo, maybe on the homepage, we just want to have uh a welcome text.\nSo, we can say something like we're building a blog.\nThe homepage should just be a welcome text.\nAnd then there should be a slash post page where we list all the posts.\nThe posts are on a WordPress instance that is on this URL.\nSo I'm just going to copy the URL here and I'm just going to paste this Cloudways uh URL that we got.\nThis is where our WordPress instance is living.\nSo let's actually just see what it will do with this.\nSo here we just have all of this text here from the setup.\nI do like to clear out all of that context if we have like a new task.\nAnd now we have a clean chat view here again.\nSo let's actually press enter and see what it will do.\nOkay, so it's going to check out the current folder structure.\nOkay, so actually it will try to use the types for a WordPress post.\nThis is actually really nice.\nUh so it already has a sense of how a WordPress post is structured in terms of code.\nSo a post will have an ID, for example, and a slug.\nThis is like the what you see in the URL, the the basically URL friendly version of the title of the post, but the title itself is also included and the content of the post.\nSo during training, these AI models probably have already picked up on a lot of the WordPress uh code related things.\nAll right.\nSo then it's using a so-called WordPress API service.\nLet's actually quickly see what it's doing there.\nSo interestingly, it has already figured out that it can get the posts from the WordPress instance that we have through the REST API.\nSo actually if you spin up a WordPress instance, it comes with a REST API as it's called.\nThere is also GraphQL option by the way if you prefer that.\nBut if I just type in this URL that it's using now, you can already see that this is the uh API endpoint to see the well basically an index of the uh API endpoints.\nBut if we go to /ost there, we have the actual posts on the WordPress instance.\nYou can see we have third post here as a slug automatically created from the title that we gave.\nThe actual title is third post like this, like how we typed it, and then uh the actual content here is rendered as follows.\nSo here we have amazing third post here.\nThat's what we just added in our WordPress instance.\nAnd so by this using this URL, our agent is able to bring those posts into our custom front end here, right?\nSo we can see here it has created so-called uh methods here or functions basically for well let's see for getting uh posts.\nWe can specify how many basically and how much how much per page.\nIt has also specified that we can get posts by a slug.\nYeah.\nalready looks pretty sophisticated overall.\nI will actually just close out of the code and just let it do it thing and we'll see in a minute it will look like.\nIt has already changed the homepage into something else.\nSo of course we can change the design if we want uh change the buttons.\nThe point is that it has just replaced that default next boiler plate with a more blog oriented uh welcoming page, right?\nThis is just a homepage.\nSo what we would want now is that we go to slashposts.\nOkay.\nSo we'll just wait until it's completely finished here.\nAll right.\nRight.\nSo I just stopped it there actually because it was going on for quite some time.\nBut let's actually take a look at what it has done so far.\nSo we have that new homepage now with uh homepage now.\nWell, if we click on this button here, it will go to /ost.\nSo now you can see we have a new page here.\nSo it has added a new page with some uh content here.\nBut here we see the actual uh posts from our WordPress instance.\nSo the agent knew how to retrieve the content from our WordPress instance.\nYou can see those posts that we just added are listed right here, including the uh content actually, and this is indeed what we specified, right?\nSo we said something like create a slash post page that lists all the po posts that we have, but what it has also done is now it has created an individual page for each post.\nSo if I click on this, let's actually see, yeah, so here we go to an actual individual page for that particular post.\nSo here we say third post and uh we have the content right here as well.\nSo it has spun up this entire blog here with actually just well two prompts actually.\nIt was able to consume the content from our separate WordPress instance, and actually it knows really well what I wanted to do because I didn't even specify that I also wanted a page, an individual page for each individual post, but it was already able to figure out that indeed I would want something like that, and so it just went ahead and did it for me.\nThat is this slug thing that you see here in square brackets, the dynamic route as it's called index next.js JS, right?\nAnd we could continue iterating over this, right?\nSo now I could say something like um right, I want my pages to be statically rendered as it's called.\nSo basically I want this to be uh plain HTML.\nWe can run a so-called build and it will be plain HTML.\nSo I can also say something like uh please make the posts pages uh statically rendered, right?\nOr static.\nLet's see if it understands.\nAll right.\nSo actually I stopped it there cuz it was going on for a long time again, and it started changing the actual next.js JS conve which is more like a central part of our app which should not be lightly edited, so I was stopping it there.\nThis is indeed how you can make a page statically rendered as it's called in Next.js.\nSo basically just needs to specify for which slugs Next.js should render those pages static.\nNow here it's using a so-called surface.\nUm so maybe that's not the style that you would want.\nSo just like before, we can go to co-pilot instructions or cursor rules and specify the type of the style that you want it to code.\nIf it works, it works, right?\nSo it's not a huge deal.\nBut I would say, yeah, with this AI trend now, it allows you to build pretty sophisticated uh projects actually, even if you're not completely comfortable with all of the code uh details.\nSo I can host the WordPress instance here in Cloudways.\nThey actually have a great platform here, very easy to use.\nThey also have the autonomous option here for fully managed hosting that autoscaled.\nSo that may be something you want to take a look at.\nIn any case, I want to thank Cloudways for sponsoring the video.\nMake sure to check them out with the link in description.\nAnd I hope that this helps you with your WordPress and AI journey.\nThanks for watching and I hope to see you in the next one.\nBye.\n",
