  "cleanText": "Welcome to Syntax. Today we got an episode for you on background agents, long-running AI tasks, uh, some of these coding tools that are significantly more expensive and significantly more like autonomous, being able to run it on your own. Some that are fine-tune models. We're talking about like, uh, the Open AI codecs, Claude Code, the new cursor background agents. They just released a new $200 a month plan. And like, I feel like we're on like the cusp of like another wave of these tools and another wave of what they can do and how we're actually using them. Which is hilarious, cuz if you go back to the episode of us at the end of last year, one of my predictions was, I feel like the AI is going to get like, like I feel like we're not going to see any major, uh, improvements this year. You know, we're just going to get significantly or a little bit better here and there. But man, this stuff is really exciting. And I've dove into all the different tools. We're going to talk about how they work and how you might want to use them and are they really that much better? And is it really worth spending 10 times the amount that you're spending on like a co-pilot subscription or something like that?\n Yeah. One thing I think we did get right, uh, was that the AIs themselves might not go through some extreme evolution, but the way in which we use them will evolve. And I think already through June here, we're seeing so many different new, totally different new approaches to interaction with them. And I, I at, uh, I was actually just got back from JS Nation and React Summit in Amsterdam where I was MCing both days, and I had a lot of conversations with people about the interfaces in which we interface with AI, and that was like such a huge topic of conversation, more so than like, will the models get better, will this get better, that, whatever, it's more or less like, how are we interfacing with these things? And I, I found there to be a massive amount of thought-provoking, um, ideas and discussion there.\n Cuz I, I at the very start, I was looking at all these like CLI tools, um, like OpenAI codeex, cloud code, those are probably the two big ones, where instead of using like an editor like a cursor or or VS Code, you're simply just typing into the terminal, and I was like, are you really, is that really a better interface, just typing into a terminal? You don't get the full UI and and all the diffs and all of that stuff. And and granted, there are like connections you can use and it, but like the amount of people that said, you're thinking about it wrong, Wes, you're thinking about it like that, you're just sitting there and looking at what it does, and and these are much more of a set it and forget it and let this thing go off and run. So that's what we're going to talk about today is this sort of new wave of of everything.\n Yeah.\n Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. I, I'm I'm curious to hear some of your thoughts on on some of these things, cuz I, I did use cloud code for a bit and, uh, yeah, I, I don't know if I got it, so I'm interested in getting it a little bit better.\n So I've kind of broken this down into two major sections. Um, both which are are kind of related to each other. The first one being this idea of background agents and the second one being CLI tools, which can be used as as just part of your existing tooling. So first one, background agents, they're becoming very popular. They, the idea with them is that you, you give them a task, right? We have, we have agents already. You give it a task, you type in the box, and then it goes ahead and and does the work that you want. And then you look at it and say accept or or reject, or you type back and forth to it. And sometimes you'll go back and forth with with several prompts. The idea with background agents is you can, it can do a lot more. These things are going to have significantly increase in power. They're going to run for a lot longer. They are going to run concurrently, meaning that many people are simply just setting up, okay, today I have to do three or four tasks, let me set off three or four background agents, and they're all going to run concurrently or they're all going to run in parallel, um, as I go ahead and and do something else.\n Can you give me a type of task that which would be appropriate for?\n Yeah, so an example might be on one thing that I gave it, I said, add related episode embeddings feature, meaning that like I want it to go off and create an entire feature for the syntax website where it takes every single episode, all the transcript, it does embeddings, and then it will save those to the database. It will create an API endpoint for those embeddings. It will be able to find, use those embeddings to find related episodes to each other, um, as well as create a whole bunch of Svelte components that we could pop like in the syntax website, say like, if you like this episode, here are three more that are similar to this, and then we could also have like a 2D graph that would sort of group them together, and then theoretically, we could use that for tagging the episodes as well. Um, so that's that's a fairly significant feature, which may take an AI agent, like, I don't know, 30 minutes, an hour, um, to go ahead off and and do. So what you can do is you can give it a, we'll talk about this, like requirements document or tasks document, and it can go off and run that, and then you can go to another one, which is like, we simply just have like lots of like little one-off issues on GitHub that are, I don't know, maybe half an hour, 45 minutes worth of work, and we, we are beta testing the Slack integration right now, where you can simply just set it at a GitHub issue, and it will go off and and fix those things for you. So, background agents, they're a little bit different than just regular agents in that they, they will run for a larger amount of time. And simply by by using background agents, and I've also been testing the like Max Mode in cursor as well, it seems to simply just like check its work and just kind of keep recursively going back over itself until absolutely everything has been done. And it's, it's pretty, pretty impressive. Like another example was I needed to migrate, uh, we switched the RSS feed for the syntax podcast. We moved from Libsyn to Megaphone, and and part of that was we have 912 markdown files that have MP3 URLs in them. And I needed to take the old RSS feed, line up the GUID, the guaranteed unique identifiers. I needed to line that up with the new RSS feed. Um, and then I needed to find the related episode markdown file, parse the front matter of that, switch out the MP3 URL, and then push it to GitHub, right? And that's like seven or eight steps. And the thing ran for, for like 20 minutes, and it did an absolute perfect job of of getting them all in for me. I maybe not a perfect job. I had to step in two or three times and clarify what it was. But if I had been a little bit more upfront and a little more clear with how it worked, and there was a lot of like kind of messy data, some of the URLs didn't follow the same patterns as others, and it did like a really nice job where I could simply set it off. I went and went and worked on something else, and then I came back to it, and it had done 20, 25 minutes worth of work in the background. And it's, it's quite amazing if you're willing to spend the money on these. Like the $20 a month plan is not going to do as good of a job as some of these pay as you go or more expensive plans.\n Yeah. And hopefully, maybe this is something your work could be covering. So possibly being able to use something like this episode to convince your boss that this might be worth your time. Uh, that's interesting. So is it in this particular case, are there several different agents processes handling different things and coordinating with each other? Is that what's happening or the idea with the idea with a background agent is you set off one background agent, do this task, but you can have multiple of those running at the same time.\n Okay.\n So it's not like an agent is going to spawn off multiple agents on its own. Yeah. You would just set it off. The one thing about the cursor integration is that it has to run in their, their cursor cloud. Um, and it's essentially just running an entire VS Code instance in the cursor cloud, and then you can go in at any time and and see how it's going. So basically, you can like tap into the the whole VS Code UI.\n Yeah, at any time. Which is kind of interesting because some people said, I would just set this off at work, and then I maybe check in on it on the bus ride home, and then by the time I got home, or you can like just like set things off without having to be at your computer, which is is kind of an interesting one, which is being able to code from your phone or or code mobiley.\n Yeah. Do you feel like this is something you can trust to go off and do a bunch of stuff?\n Um, yes and no. Um, like it run, you have to like run it in like in in like a sandbox, right? Because if it, that's also the nice thing about the cursor code is that it runs in the cloud. So it's not running on your computer.\n So it's not necessarily going to run and like nuke your entire machine or something like that because Yeah. Like, should you trust it? Maybe. But will something bad happen eventually? Probably.\n Yeah, but but even with like mine, it would create backups of the files before it went ahead and changed them. Um, but it didn't do them for everyone. It just did like two or three, checked its work and said, \"Okay, that's working.\" Then it, it deleted those and then did it to the rest of them. Which is exactly how how I would approach it as well. You know, do two or three, create a backup.\n Yeah. And then if it's working, go ahead.\n Wild.\n Yeah. So, cursor background agents, they just released a $200 a month plan, which just goes to show that like these things are using quite a bit of compute power. Open AAI has their own codeex, which is both a CLI and there's like a UI as part of chat GPT. Um, Devon is probably was one of the first on the scene. Again, it's it's kind of funny how much we laughed about these things six months ago, and now we're starting to see them. It's actually actually half decent. I've not personally tried Devon, but it's the same idea. Copilot workspaces or where like Scott, you have tried this yourself, right? You you went in and gave it a whole task and it just went off in the background and did it.\n Yeah. And I found at the time, I mean, it was like super early access, and I wasn't super impressed with the copilot workspaces, but I was impressed with the workflow itself.\n So, I would only assume it's gotten much better by now. I, I would love to give it another another rip because I did really enjoy the workflow. If only it had succeeded at the time. So, but again, that was that was like what a year ago. That was very early.\n Mhm. The one like UI I didn't like is when we were using background agents as part of the like Slack. What I didn't like about it was that like it went off and did all of its work, and then it came back and I had to like give feedback to it. And I much, I much prefer the whole IDE. You can see all of the steps that it's taken. You can see all the diffs, and then you can you can either change something yourself or simply just give it another chat. And the Slack integration, you can give it sort of a follow-up, but I don't know. I, I think I still prefer that type of thing.\n I certainly don't mind watching over an agent doing work and then like confirming it as it goes or\n Yeah, I, I don't mind that because it does feel much more like a more controlled workflow than sending a Slack message.\n Totally. Other ones, there's clin amp code, there's a whole bunch of similar ones in the space of the like sort of background agents, and then the second category I have here is CLI tooling. Um, so cloud code is probably the biggest one in the space right now, and then there's open AAI codeex CLI, and then DAX is working on another one, it looks like, called, uh, open code, uh, which is is kind of cool. You'll be able to just like run it, and I'm assuming put your own models behind it. So these are just straight up CLI tools, which can you can integrate it into your editor. But the the benefit to simply being a CLI tool is there's no dependency on your IDE or or any sort of integration. So theoretically, you can think of it as just being able to npm install something. Of course, you can use it via the CLI, but it also is simply just an API, which could be part of something else. So you would imagine you have integration with like GitHub issues. You have integration with your your Jira or your, what's the one everybody loves so much because it's local first?\n Linear.\n Linear, yeah, linear integration. And the idea, I think, with with this, these type of integrations, you simply just assign it to an agent, um, and then that will then go off, do its work, and and you can build stuff on top of these as well. You can bake your own software and being able to like layer in adding MCP servers to this type of stuff. You can build some pretty powerful software with these as primitives.\n Yeah.\n Yeah. That it all sounds wild in. Have you spent some time with cloud code?\n Yeah. Yeah. I, I went into it, and let me tell you, I went as pay as you go, which is is not the way to go. It's so stressful. Every single keystroke I made, I was so concerned about it costing too much because like it, it adds up pretty quickly. So like example, I, I went into a very simple demo that had maybe seven or eight files. I think it was a simple React application, and I just asked it, \"What does this repo do?\" 9 cents. 9 cents out the door. You know, like that's not, obviously not a lot of money, but if if every single time that you hit enter, you're you're paying 10 cents out the door. And then I, I another prompt I gave was, add a new example called iPhone.html with some CSS to replicate an iPhone layout. Uh, that went ahead and and spent eight cents, which again, not a ton, but imagine it going off and and it come, it went back and forth three or four times, but then imagine going on like an actual real mega codebase. Yeah. And simply it understanding, how does this codebase work? Which files do I need to include? What are your, what does your database model look like? How, how do I run all of these things? I just ran\n\n\nA LLinter. Now, let me take the LLinter and the TypeScript output. Let me send that back. You're going back and forth. I think like some of my examples with Background Agents where I don't know, back and forth 100, 150 times, which can really add up. So, pay as you go stresses me out. I much rather just pay the single amount and then be able to just blast it. And I was surprised at how many people were willing to pay. I still haven't shelled out the 200 bucks, but we're part of the Century Cursor. Um, and David Kramer was just like, \"Let her rip.\" Like, you know, like this stuff is, this is game-changing stuff. I personally, so uh, he's like, \"Let me know if you need more credit or whatever. Just like go nuts with it.\" So, I am still impressed by how many people are willing to pay this much money, which I think I understand. What do you think? 200 bucks, is that too much?\n Uh, it depends on who's footing the bill. Uh, you know, it is, and it really, if it's coming out of my post, if it's coming out of my paycheck pocket, then I would say maybe too much. But if it's coming out of like, like if I still was a business owner and it was a business expense and is part of operating my business, then that's a different conversation for me. Um, if you're paying, like I guess you have to see like the actual quality output of this to see is it worth it? You know, you have to see some kind of return. I think we're, we are, we are past it being a cool demo, but not quite at the like, holy crap, this thing is amazing, you know, like it still does bad things and still you have to babysit it. But I'm, I'm curious if somebody were like, let's say you're paying three or four devs, um, would you pay an extra thousand bucks a month? Probably. I don't know. It's, that's hard to say.\n Yeah. And that's, that's hard. That's a hard conversation anyways because sometimes you'd rather employ people for a number of reasons beyond just uh, the effect. I'm not talking about replacing them, but I'm like, like would you give them this $200 a month tool? Um, and I guess corporate probably would, cuz the amount that these companies spend just for you to be able to zoom each other is quite a bit.\n Yeah, no kidding.\n Yeah, it is. That is always mystifying to me when you get into corporate accounts on anything, just how expensive pay by head is the real money maker on these things. Let's talk about approaches. So what I've learned with doing these Background Agents is you can't simply just yolo type in the box, make this thing. You need a very good planning document for it to follow because it does its best when it's able to have very clear inputs, very clear defined tasks to do, um, very clear outcomes and success, and also I found that a lot of them will start to log their work as they are doing markdown. What was happening with the migration of the RSS feed is that it would, it would loop over and it would log. Okay, out of, out of the 912 episodes, 115 didn't work. Let me now evaluate those and see if there's anything that I can. Oh, I see these ones had a different URL structure. Let me update the reax so that it would match a little bit better. And it put all of that in a markdown document, then reran it, and then, and then put it the updated. Okay, now out of those 80 more were successful, now let's look at the last 20 that we need to do. So it's putting it all into a markdown document.\n So what I found is for it to be able to sort of tear off a task and work on that specific task and then work on the next thing, I think you get much better outcomes than rather just saying implement this feature. Um, and hilariously enough, a really good way to make these documents called PRD. I didn't even know what this was. Product requirement document, which is you can create a really nice structured PRD document by just kind of spitballing all of your ideas of what needs to happen, throw that into ChatGPT or something like that, and then get back a really nice structured document and then give it a once more, once over, clean it up, make sure it does everything you want, cuz the cleaner your input is, yeah, go ahead.\n No, to be, to be clear to the audience, a PRD document, not an AI specific thing.\n No, that's, that's a software engineering thing.\n Right.\n Uh, where you, you define what it is you actually want and how things will be approached and what technology you're going to be using, and by putting as much of those things in up front, you're going to get better out the other end. Alongside this, I've been seeing a couple people on Twitter talk about this, which is Claude Taskmaster. So, this is built, I believe this is built on top of Cloud Code and MCP servers. And the idea is is that you can give it a PRD document and then it will generate all of the tasks and be able to figure out which tasks can be done concurrently and which tasks rely on another task to be done, be done first, and then it will just kind of go off and and and do that all for you. So, I haven't tried it myself, but it's, it's this is just a really good example of now that we have these lower level primitives like Cloud Code and MCP servers, we're starting to see some really cool tools that people are now building on top of that.\n Yeah.\n Yeah. I know. I, I've recently gotten uh, some interesting tasks done with MCP via what's GDAU, the gaming engine with GDAU MCP, and like there is something really magical about being able to interface with um, a UI like that via cursor or any of these things because the tasks are no longer then divvied off into like what can code write. It's like you can think more broadly about the tasks that you need to do and and yeah, it's a, it's a whole new world of stuff. That's for sure.\n Yeah. You know, one thing that I'm surprised about with all this MCP stuff is where's if this and that in this whole space? You know, if this and that was killing it in the whole connect anything to anything, and then they rode like the whole like, like automation phase, and then all of the like smart home stuff. They wrote that whole thing. Where are they with the MCP stuff that they're like, it feels like they're prime for being able to make MCP servers for absolutely anything, you know?\n Yeah.\n I do have a tool for you that is if this then that, like that we can talk about in our AI tools episode that we're going to be recording. So, I'll save it. At least drop it. Drop the name of it for anyone who's going to get mad right now, and then we'll talk about a bit more.\n How about next Monday? How about they have to leave a... No, I'm not going to do that. You don't, you do you hate that on Instagram where people are like, \"Leave a comment of this to uh, find out what I'm talking about,\" and then everybody's like, actually does it. Everybody goes in the comments and plays into their hand. So that way it's like most validating that people.\n I saw one this morning. I got a Tik Tok of some guy was like, um, power of sale real estate right now is is really hard to find. I was like, it's not hard to find it. They're literally all on realtor.ca. They're all on on this like system. You just have to search the word power sale. He's probably has a script where he's he searches for power of sale poss. And then he emails the them all the time. He's like, I, I'm, I have a whole collection. I'm really good at finding them, and you really need to understand how to navigate these. I was like, and all the people below are like typing the word so they get it in their DM.\n Dude, there are some really awful social media like trends right now. That being one of them. And another one just people just like blatantly saying something that is like incredibly and obviously antagonistic and false just so everybody like Rage Bait. I mean, Rage Bait's been around forever, but it feels like it's so much worse now.\n Yeah. It that drives me nuts. And and even further when like somebody you thought you trusted sends you that thing, like you got, got, you got, you got, you got, got for sure, very clearly fake or very clearly bait.\n Yeah.\n Okay. By the, the, just so I'm not falling into that. Uh, the tool is Lang Flow from data stacks.\n U, this thing's really cool. So we'll talk about this in another episode, but give that, give that a check. I'll have the link in the in the show notes. I'm not, I'm not doing that. Uh, that's for sure. All right. Cool. Well, this was, this has been awesome, Wes. I, I haven't spent a ton of time with Background Agents just yet. I, I'm still like in the um...\n You're a bit more of a foreground guy right now.\n Been more of a foreground guy. Um, but I know, I, I've gotten into Cloud Code a little bit, but that's, that's about it. I'm going to try some of these background tasks and cursor uh, today and uh, get, get busy with some of that stuff. Um, do you want to head into Sick Picks and Shameless Plugs? Stuff you want to sick pick?\n I got a sick pick for you. One sec.\n Me, too. As he dips below his desk. He dips.\n It's, I, it's not like I was going to come up in a costume. I was just unplugging something.\n Okay.\n Oh, a little projector.\n I love projectors.\n This is my sick pick for a 12-year-old projector. That's actually really good. 12-year-old projector.\n We have at our cottage, we have a projector cuz we don't have room for a TV, but we have like a huge wall that we can project on, and I've had like a Ben Q, whatever projector I bought like right before the pandemic, and unfortunately it is starting to die, and it's not the bulb, it's like the chip inside, and it's not worth fixing. So, I was like, \"All right, I need to find a new one.\" And I know you have like a really nice laser one you can play outside and whatever. And I was like, I kind of want one of those, but I also don't want to spend any money.\n Yeah.\n So, I was like, I got to find like another cheapy on um, marketplace and whatnot. And I've been looking for a while and I found this one, which is a Dell M210X. And it's, I don't know, it's like 10 years old or whatever, and I found it, and these were really big in like corporate world, so there's lots of them on the market right now, and it's bright as hell, 2,000 anc lumens, which is bright enough to have like in like daytime and be able to project, not outside, but inside during daytime. And it's got HDMI inputs, it has audio in and out, and it's just like, I got for 50 bucks, and I...\n 50 bucks, 50 bucks.\n And like, man, if you want like a good, I initially bought a like $200 one on Amazon, and then I was like, I plugged it in, I was like, this thing sucks, and it's said it, it was like, like 8,000 lumens or something like that, and then I, I very quickly realized that projectors on Amazon are mostly a scam unless it's from a reputable company. I guess you can say anything on Amazon is mostly a scam. So I returned it cuz I was like, this thing sucks. It's garbage. And I, I went and found like a, like a proper little corporate one. So if, and look how nice and small this is. If you want a nice little projector, go on marketplace and search for like Dell projector. And they have mercury bulbs, which they last like 16,000 hours or something like that. It has, this one has 200 hours on it. So I'm like 1% of the way through its actual life. And so I'm, I'm really excited about this thing to be able to bring it back to the cottage and watch some shows on it.\n Nice.\n Yeah, I do really like my laser projector. It looks like you can get it on eBay for like 300 bucks now cuz they stopped selling this model specifically. Um...\n It's not bad at all.\n They stopped... Yeah, they stopped selling it. So, um, but you can find them pre-owned. It's...\n It's, you can't watch it super during daytime, which is a bummer. Sometimes I want to like put on a football game or something outside. Uh, but I got to say, man, it's projector season over here at the Tolinsky household. And we're watching, what are we watching? Love Island. We're watching uh, Top Chef. We're watching all the shows out there uh, in Debat, just projecting on the wall. And it is just like, man, there's something so lovely, especially in, in Colorado because there's no mosquitoes. It's dry climate. You're just sitting out there and being like...\n Mhm. Do you guys have a fire pit back there, don't you?\n Yeah, we got a fire pit. And uh...\n And what do you do for speakers?\n I have, I bought like boat... They're not boat speakers, but they're like outdoor patio speakers, and they're, there's uh, just one powered, and I, I basically just, I'm running an extension cord out there anyways. Like whenever we set, we have our setup, I just plug in the one speaker, and they just stay out there all, all year long because they're, they're waterproof. Even though the waterproofing was just like a piece of foam inside the thing that like they, I had, I ended up like sealing them up pretty heavy and stuff like that to get them to actually uh, be able to withstand the elements. But yeah, I just leave them out all year. I leave them out there in the snow even, and then uh, yeah. So um, it's nice. They're Bluetooth. Connect the projector to the Bluetooth. Put a little Google Home in that projector, and then uh... or it's a chcast. It's an older chcast, and bingo bango. Ready to go. Oh, you got, you got speakers behind the, the, you can connect the patio furniture.\n A Google, you can connect a chcast to Bluetooth speakers.\n Yeah.\n Oh, maybe you just solved my problem cuz I'm thinking like we have, I've got speakers run, but it's not a great run, and the like robot vacuum always sucks the cord up, and I'm so sick of it. And I'm thinking like, hm, what could I do without having to run cables everywhere? Bluetooth, the Bluetooth...\n\n\nOutdoor speaker is great. Connect it. It all works super well. Um, big, big fan of that setup, and it was sort of like third year running it maybe now, and it's just like so, so lovely. What next thing I need to do is 3D print um a little like riser for the projector so that way it's always perfectly aligned, cuz right now I have some like plastic shims that I'm like shimming underneath the projector, and I got to like set it up each time. So I'm going to build a little box for that thing. Oh, that's a great idea. Maybe uh put a cover on it to make it rainproof. Sometimes we're out there in the rain, and we want to watch We want to watch our stuff in the rain. Yeah, I'm going to Sick Pick. I got a a smart ring, which you know what? People are always talking about wearing the Apple Watch to sleep and stuff like that. I just cannot do that. That thing I do and bulky. Yeah, man. I like I I sometimes like lay on my wrist and stuff. I just can't do it. Yeah. Sometimes I wake up with like no feeling in my arms. Yeah. Well, the the big thing about the smart rings to me has always been the subscription fees and stuff like that. I cannot justify another subscription. Um, so Courtney did a bunch of research uh because she wanted to track her sleep, and she got a Ringcon Gen 2, and I had never heard of Ringcon before she did that research on it. She got this one specifically because it does tracking of sleep apnea and stuff. And I've had it now for I got it right before I left for um Amsterdam, and it's just been lovely. It's been lovely to track sleep. It does a really good job. The battery lasts for like 11 days. Um, and then it it charges and everything like that, and it you know it's calculating all your stress and all those things. And for me I've been very stressed out. So, like being able to look at that and be like, \"Oh, I need to like really get it together right now has been very nice.\" Um, but overall, yeah, I, you know, I I do say for like like just general like vitals and whatever tracking, I found this thing to be much nicer than having the watch. It's honestly amazing the the tech, like the health tech that is getting so accessible in the last however many years. Like even my Apple Watch, I like when I was on the last conference, I like was like super jet-lagged, and then we went out drinking and and then the next morning it's like, \"Hey, you're probably getting sick and uh or like like something's going on with you. You know, your heart rate was up when you were sleeping and and like all of your things.\" And it's amazing that it it can predict those things ahead of time. So hopefully you can curb it. Yeah. For sure. Uh, well, that's Sick Pick. Shameless Plugs. Check us out on YouTube. Syntax on YouTube. Syntax, I believe it's syntax at syntaxfm on YouTube. Check us out at syntax. All right. Thanks for tuning in, and we'll catch you later. Peace. Peace.\n",
