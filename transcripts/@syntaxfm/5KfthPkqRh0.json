  "cleanText": "Welcome to Syntax. Today we got an episode on news that's going on in web development. A crazy amount of news has dropped in the last week or two, and we're here to round it up for you. My name is Wes, and with me, Scott's out today, we got CJ. How's it going, CJ? It's good. Hello. Glad to be here. Glad to go over all this stuff. There's a lot going on. So, yeah, it's exciting. Yeah, it's funny. Scott and I were saying, like, I don't know, maybe like two weeks ago, like, oh, things were kind of a little bit sluggish in the news front, and then all of a sudden, I feel like in the last two weeks, there's so much has sort of hit us. So let's get on into it.\n\n[Music]\n\nFirst thing we have here is uh, WWDC announced that Safari 26. So, this is a little bit odd, but they're Apple's renaming everything to correspond with the year. Um, and now Safari 20, we're we're on what, 17 or 18 right now, jumping to 26. But with that comes a whole bunch of new APIs, which is is actually pretty exciting. So, first one is SVG favicons. I'm really excited about this. So, I run this little um website called fab.farm, which just gives you a quick little um emoji favicon if you're just doing a demo. Um, because I hate that stupid little cannot find favicon icoicico message in my terminal, and I hate having to like find an image every single time. So there's this little hack you can do with the inline SVG. Um, and I've just made a little web service to serve them up. However, Safari has not supported SVG. So, I've always had to like run a something that converts it to PNG on the server. And then finally, I I'm able to not deprecate that, but I'm now able to serve up SVGs to all my Safari users.\nYeah, that's great. I've been using that trick. Like, I didn't know you had this site, but I know that you can like embed the data URL for SVG, but I had no idea that Safari didn't support it. So, yeah, that's awesome that support it now.\nYeah. And it it's actually kind of important because they along with that, they also announced that a bunch of the like any site, this one, any site can be a web app now. So Safari has long been not a supporter of progressive web apps, but you are now able to basically install any app to your home screen, um, whether they have the metatag or not. And the Safari desktop also does something similar to this as well. And it's it's actually kind of nice to be able to have apps put on your doc or on your iPhone home screen. Definitely. Yeah, I've used that just like on my phone, just like launching sites. Uh, like if I want to get to the weather, but I don't want to use a weather app, I'll install it as an app. So I'm sure that's just as useful, but with Safari, but I don't use Safari. So all of this stuff is is new to me. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's it's super handy. Especially like my kids have like iPads, and they have we've got like so many stupid apps on there, and like deleting them alone takes like like 30 seconds per app. It's so slow, and I just I want to nuke them all, and I was like, I just wish that this was uh a web page that I could bookmark. So now now we can.\n\nNice. Um, WebGPU has landed in Safari 26. So, this is really exciting because WebGPU is um, they say here, the successor to WebGL. So WebGL is the ability to run um lower level graphics and shaders and things like that in the browser. But with WebGPU, you get um a little bit more access to like the bare the lower level metal. Um, and this is both really good for for graphics and games and stuff like that, but it's also very good for doing things that are computationally expensive, like running local AI models. So, uh, Transformers.js is a package that you can run local AI models in JavaScript. Um, so in the browser, in Node and Dino, whatever. And WebGPU speeds them up like significantly. I think I had a couple examples where I was generating alt text. You give it an image, it generates alt text for an image, and it was taking about 11 seconds for an image, which is like cool demo, but like that's not real world, right? Um, and it brought it down to like something like 300 milliseconds or or 600 milliseconds for generating alt text for an image, which starts to get inside of the like, hm, that's actually pretty fast. And if I were to resize it, make it a little smaller, you probably could get that within 150 milliseconds.\nNice. So, I hadn't heard of WebGPU? Like, I'm familiar with WebGL. Like, I know that's what like 3JS is built off of and stuff like that, but is WebGPU a standard? Like, are other browsers implementing it as well?\nYes. Yeah, WebGPU is a new web standard that's sort of the successor to to WebGL. Okay. And like 3JS can use it. BabylonJS, like all these 3D libraries, but then as well as Transformers.js JS and Onyx runtime. Those are um the two like machine learning AI model run times.\nYeah. And and they can then use that. So now it's supported in Safari. It's it's in Chrome already, and of course, not in Safari just yet. We're hopefully it will come very soon, which uh yeah, or sorry, what did I say? You said not in Safari. Oh, obviously it's in Safari. This is what we're talking about. Firefox. Yeah, it's not in Firefox. Okay. Okay. Yeah, it kills me because I saw um Brendan, like, probably 12, 13, 15 years ago. I saw Brendan Ike at a conference, and he was demoing WebGL, and he's like, this is the future, man. And uh, Firefox has strayed from those those origins. Yeah, hopefully they come around to it. Um, I guess this this also is aligned with like maybe even it was like maybe a year ago or two years ago that Chrome released window.ai. AI, like the actual um, like LLM inside the browser. But with web GPU, uh, it's only going to get better because uh, the LLMs run much better on directly on GPU.\nYeah. Like significantly faster. Even things like um being able to calculate embeddings in the client. So, if you want to be able to like find something that is similar, um, this is how a lot of like code agents work, or if you want to if we wanted to embed every single syntax show and find like similar episodes or group them together via tags, you'd have to convert them all to embeddings first, right? And now that it's fast enough, you're you can start doing a lot of that computing in the browser. Um, not necessarily you could do all the episodes in the browser. You probably don't want to. You probably want to put that in a database, but what somebody types or as they're typing it, you can just convert those to embeddings on every keystroke now and then show them the results pretty quickly.\nYeah, that's huge. I think especially it's going to enable some architectures where you're not as dependent on a server for AI or for embeddings like that. So pages are going to be faster. So yeah, that's cool. Firefox has got it behind a flag, and they have for what? Five, six, seven years.\nSo, yeah, it's not stable yet, but Oh, hopefully soon. Hopefully soon. But, and I guess the So, we're on Can I use, and it's listing Safari as technical preview, but I guess with version 26, does that bring it in to stable or is it still technical preview? Uh, once Safari 26 is released, then it will be stable. Um, which is exciting because like technology preview is, yeah, we're playing with it, whatever. They've had it in technology preview for a long time, and it was behind a flag for a while, and then they took it off of a flag last month. But like you don't you never know when it's actually going to be released to the masses. But it's huge, especially cuz like that means it's on the iPhone, and that means that you can have access to the iPhone metal via the browser, right?\nThat's great. A bunch of CSS goodies. Um, so Una Kravitz had a really good thread of all the things that are now landing in Safari. So, anchor positioning, being able to position items based on another item. So, they don't have to be in the same container. They don't have to be relative to each other. You can simply just like place this thing at the top right hand corner over and up 20 pixels based on this other element. And that's that's amazing for tool tips and for popover and things like that. She did just tweet a bunch of stuff around the implementation is not 100% to spec, which is just like Safari, come on. So hopefully that changes before launch, but it's kind of disappointing to see. Okay. Um, but scroll driven animations, have you dipped into that at all?\nI have not. No. What's What's going on there?\nYeah, scroll driven animations is the ability to scrub a key frame. So you have a key frame that goes from zero to 100%, and normally you you use time to to scrub that key frame, right? Over 10 seconds. Um, scroll driven animations allows you to scrub that key frame via where you are scrolled in the DOM. So you can say start when this element pops into the viewport and then stop when it is 50% out of the viewport. Um, it's really cool. I'm really excited about it. I've I have it there. There's a JavaScript API and there's a CSS API. Um, so I've used the JavaScript API with a polyfill in an upcoming site for one of my courses, and it it looks really cool.\nNice. Text wrap pretty progress function, margin, trim, contrast, color, a whole bunch of just little like things that we've been sort of waiting on. Um, and they're they're all landing all at once in Safari, which I'm excited about.\nYeah, this it's a huge release for for Safari. All this stuff we've been like we've been talking about Apple lagging along for the longest time. Yeah. All of a sudden they just give us everything.\nYeah. Yeah. They've been been pretty good at in the last like couple years. Like there's still a lot of negative. People get pissed every time I talk anything positive about Safari. But yeah, they've been they've been doing well at a lot of the CSS stuff has been coming out.\nIn like React news, I guess you could you can say it. Um, Remix has announced that Remix is no longer going to be like React-based. So, it's kind of a very confusing thing because in the very early days, we had React Router. Um, and we had a couple versions of that, and then it got turned into or they had another thing called Reach Router, and then that got merged back into React Router, and then out of React Router came Remix, which is like the full stack application, meaning that you can you can do loaders and server side rendering and all of that stuff. And then React Router 7, Remix went back into it, and then Remix was just dead. And now they've announced that Remix 3 is going to be its own thing. Um, it's going to be it's it's a fork of Pact. So, it's not going to be React at all. It's going to be um minimal dependencies, no build tool, totally built on web APIs. So, I've been I've been watching Michael Jackson, who's the one of the maintainers of React Router and and and Remix on on his GitHub, and he's been posting all of these packages that are all built around web standards, you know, streaming, file upload, all these web APIs. And I was like, they're working on something there. And then they recently announced that like React writers is going to be its own thing, but Remix now is going to be a totally new framework. I I from scratch that's going to be very simple and no build tools, all standard, which is is kind of crazy if you think about it. I sure what you think about it.\nYeah, it's really I think I mean I think it's cool. I think there's potentially always room for a new framework, especially the people that have been on the ground floor, like working on these things, and they have ideas about how to do it better. So kind of starting starting from scratch uh makes it a whole lot easier because you don't have all the the baggage of the the previous stuff. The only issue I have is it's so confusing because people are going to hear remix and not know which one people are talking about. Like this if I think the easiest way to think about it right now is it's a brand new framework, right? It could technically it could have a different name, and that's exciting. There are ideas around um how it could be web standards-based, and it's actually based on I don't know if you mentioned it, but it's based on Pact. It's not React. And so that has a whole other rabbit hole of like potential compatibility issues of like maybe you're used to all these React libraries, but maybe they're not directly compatible with Pact. So that's there are forking Pact as well. It's not even going to be based on it. So like I'm wondering what that will look like, and will it use JSX and and how do you use JSX if you can't you don't have a build tool, right? Like is it is it going to be entirely a runtime thing? Maybe that's like they've been talking a lot about like the old days of PHP. You just upload a file, you visit that URL, and and the thing runs. So maybe they'll they'll throw some sort of templating engine as part of the request that renders it out on the server. Like we've been there, right? We have lots of server rendered templating languages that that work like that. And maybe that's I mean and I haven't dug into the announcement too much, but maybe that is kind of where they're leaning is like more on the server in that like it's basic basically if you do write JSX, it would be transpiled on request versus like needing a build tool to transpile it ahead of time.\nYeah, that might be it actually. It's just like like PHP templates, and then there's going to be no no hot reloading. Um, they did say you can add Vite if if you want to. So Evan You is a creator of Vite was like interesting, interesting move. Um, so no HMR, which is hot module reloading. That's like when you make a change in your editor, you just you save it, and your updates are immediately in the browser. Just fast reloads, minimal tooling, zero zero critical depths. So just trying to make it as fast as possible. But like I love hot module reloading. You know I think you need it for stateful applications too. I think you\n\n\nYou're deep in a deeply nested component.\nThey've changed the state a lot.\nIf the page reloads, you lose that state potentially if you don't have HMR.\nSo, I'm curious what they're going to do there.\nRemix also didn't have HMR for the longest time, and then they did add it.\nSo, I don't know if I buy that, because I don't want to have to tab and refresh every single time that it's changed.\nBut maybe one angle I haven't really thought of is maybe they're getting really dialed in with the Chrome DevTools.\nLike maybe there's, you know, how like Chrome DevTools has like workspaces and they have all these tools for mapping to your local file system.\nLike nobody really uses those tools.\nI've used them a few times here and there, but maybe that's what they're betting on.\nWe're going to have Michael Jackson on the podcast in a couple months once they're a little closer.\nAnd I have tickets to Remix Comp coming up, so I'm curious to see what's all going down here.\nOne thing we didn't even say was they're making it LLM first or like model friendly, meaning that this type of code should be easy to generate with an LLM.\nAnd it just has me thinking.\nSo, the Remix folks were acquired by Shopify a while ago.\nShopify has been trying to do their headless storefront several times now, and it hasn't really caught on in the mainstream as big as like liquid templating is in Shopify world.\nSo, it just has me thinking like they're probably looking at people just chat typing these apps into like Vzero and Lovable and Bolt, and Shopify is probably saying, \"We need something like that for Shopify stores.\nOtherwise, somebody's going to come eat our lunch.\nSomeone's going to launch the like Shopify, but you just type what you want into the box and it creates a store.\nYeah.\nSo, we need something that does that, and we need something that does server rendering.\nIt does logic.\nIt does all of that stuff.\nSo, if they can build a framework that is so dead nut simple that you can just type what you want and it generates it, I maybe that's the move here that they're not talking about.\nI think you're dead on there, because yeah, that's, I think, and especially being able to start from the ground up, like not having all the baggage of Next.js and the baggage of like even some of the React world.\nSo, yeah, I think you're dead on there.\nIf they could do this and they do it right, yeah, it's going to make it really easy to just instantly generate apps, especially for stores, especially because it's from the Shopify folks.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nLike the e-commerce thing is not really something that I've seen.\nIt's all been like this AI generated apps, you know, but I haven't seen a ton of, and like granted, I'm not in the Shopify space as much as other people are, but I haven't seen the like justoop boop type and make a storefront that you want.\nYeah.\nSo, we'll see.\nI'm pretty interested in how all of that works as well.\nYeah.\nNext up, Microsoft announced the TypeScript Native Previews.\nSo we actually had Andrew Hollsburg and Daniel Rosenwer on the podcast with Wes and Scott to announce the fact that the TypeScript compiler was going to be written in Go, and they have announced that they now have a preview available that you can try in your apps.\nSo, npm install -D @typescript/native-preview.\nAnd in their blog post, they give you some instructions on how you can start using this native TypeScript compiler instead of the one that's written in TypeScript.\nAnd so far, people are reporting really, really big speed ups.\nSo, there was a tweet from Daniel Rosser that shows running the native preview against the Blue Sky Social app had a 6.5x speed up in compile time.\nAnd that's huge.\nThat's a really big, like it's a React Native and a React desktop application.\nUm, that's rather large, a big part of it written by Dan Abramov.\nSo that's big, man.\nThey and I've been seeing these here and there, all of these different speed up improvements.\nAnd I've seen them anywhere from like 4x up to like I think I saw a couple that were 8, 8 and 1/2x, and that's just the preview, right?\nThey said when they came on, they're hoping to see 10x improvement, which is absolutely wild.\nAnd it's also really neat to see how long these big apps actually take, you know, like my apps maybe take, I don't know, seconds to compile, you know, but like some of these big apps where it's is significant time, like a minute.\nSome of these are minutes to compile simply just to make it from TypeScript to JavaScript.\nAnd that's a huge speed up.\nBut also like one crazy thing we talked about on the when we had them on the podcast was it's not just like build time, it's also faster inference.\nIt's also that the VS Code extension will be much faster.\nSo if it can just like infer your entire codebase in like a split second, that's going to be absolutely huge for both for your autocompletions, but also now AI is able to figure out what are the types in this entire, like you can pretty much get a skeleton of what your entire application looks like by ripping through and grabbing all of the types of your application.\nSo being able to give that context to the AI is absolutely huge for getting better AI results.\nAnd I think that that's going to be really big, especially as we're starting to move into this space where people are not just like building smaller stuff with AI, but they're just like build this entire feature that takes 40 minutes.\nThis AI agent goes off in the background and does it and then comes back.\nSo pretty excited about this as well.\nYeah, exciting stuff.\nI mean, I'm just glad to see a preview already.\nUm, yeah, it seems like fast.\nYeah, they announced it, but now we're already seeing these gains, and I mean, the fact that you can run it on a production codebase like Blue Sky and it works and it's faster, that's awesome.\nYeah, that's great.\nCursor launched a 1.0, which is pretty cool.\nThey have a bunch of features in there.\nThe background agents is probably the most interesting to me.\nSo the idea with the background agent is that you can give it a task and it actually runs it in the Cursor cloud, which has privacy concerns, right?\nSo now you're taking your codebase, you're running it on Cursor's cloud, and then what it does, it will go off and just continually run items for it.\nSo, um, we, I got access to it as part of Sentry.io as an enterprise customer for Cursor.\nSo we got access to that as well as the Slackbot.\nAnd I think the idea with these like background agents is that you can give it like a document with all of your different things that need to happen, like I gave it a feature, um, where I'm like, \"Please build a related episodes.\nYou got to be able to embed them all, then put them in the database, then add the tags, run a cron job that does it every day or so.\"\nAnd then I just set it off.\nAnd I think maybe, I don't know, half an hour, 45 minutes later, it came back and it just like built the entire feature.\nObviously, it wasn't perfect, but I think that's the next step that a lot of people are taking with these agents where they're simply just not, you're not just typing what you want, sitting there, and waiting for it to happen.\nYou're just saying, \"Go build this feature.\"\nAnd then you're running multiple of them in parallel where you're say like, \"I got nine features I need to build.\"\nYou can run nine of these all at once and they'll go off in the background and do it.\nAnd it's kind of cool because like there's a lot of players in this like background agent space right now, right?\nThere's OpenAI has Codeex or Codeex CLI.\nClaude has Claude Code or I think it's called.\nYeah, Claude Code.\nUm, I was playing with that yesterday as well.\nUh, there's obviously Devon, uh, GitHub Copilot has their agents thing that runs on GitHub.\nSo, there's a lot of people working in this space of give it a whole bunch of tasks to do or a task that is broken down into many things, go off and do it.\nBut, I really like this because you're able to go into Cursor and like kind of peek in it, peek in at any time and you get the whole Cursor experience.\nYou can, it's essentially just a streaming in an entire VS Code instance.\nSo you can see the whole chat, you can see all the diffs, you can roll things back, and to me it's kind of a best of both worlds where you you get, you still get the VS Code UI if you need to be able to jump into it.\nThat's great.\nI will say though, like the Slack channel was full of messages yesterday, but it was fun to see, like eventually the bot came back and I was like, \"Oh, here's your feature.\"\nCan you speak to that a little bit?\nLike you mentioned, like you can...\nIs there like a web dashboard you log into and you can see what this agent has been doing?\nIs that what you're saying?\nOr is it locally that you pull it down?\nOkay.\nUm, it's not a web dashboard.\nIt's in your Cursor settings.\nSo you go into your Cursor setting here.\nMaybe I can even show it.\nOne sec.\nSure.\nUm, um, yeah.\nSo here's an example of what I did.\nSo in the Slack channel, this is not in here.\nIn the Slack channel, I just pinged it.\nAnd I think the idea is that you ping it in the Slack channel.\nIt's part of your like linear.\nYou could tag it in a GitHub issue.\nSay, \"Hey, Cursor, can you take this one on?\"\nUm, or GitHub Copilot, can you take this project on?\nAnd it will sort of take the issue and go off and do it.\nSo I just said, \"Can you take on this feature?\"\nAnd then I linked off to the feature.\nAnd I'll show you what the document actually was as well.\nSo I basically just rambled of what I wanted a feature into chat GPT and asked it to create a PRD, product requirement document.\nAnd then it made the whole product requirement document for me.\nAnd then I went into Cursor.\nI said, \"Can you take this feature on?\"\nIt read it out and then it looked at this 62 earlier messages.\nSo, it probably ran close to a hundred prompts, which I cannot fathom how any of these companies are making money or how they plan to make money because this is expensive.\nIt's super expensive.\nI tried Claude Code.\nI put five bucks in there.\nI burned through that five bucks in like minutes just doing a whole bunch of features.\nAnd it's Yeah, you can pay like 200 bucks to get unlimited, but they are certainly not making any money off of me.\nYeah, I would say like it's impressive that it can go off and do all of this, but you, I think you've hit on a crucial point there.\nLike right now they're offering it for free in preview, but eventually you might end up paying the same amount you would pay a dev to go do this, like for the amount of time it takes to run the AI models and everything.\nYeah.\nI'm curious.\nI don't know that it will ever be as expensive as a dev, but there's a lot of people who think 600 bucks a month for one of these tools is not a lot of money, which kind of kills me in that it is furthering the divide of people being able to get into this coding.\nIt used to be like notepad and and like a dream.\nYou can go build this stuff.\nAnd now it's like, well, you have to spend, I don't know, minimum 80 bucks a month on all of these different services, otherwise you're not going to be nearly as productive as anyone.\nUm, but this is what it did.\nThis is really cool because this the background agent I'm able to just like look, like tap into it, and then I can, I get like the UI that I'm comfortable with, which the son of the a lot of the CLI tools, I you don't necessarily get that.\nYou can open diffs and whatnot, but I I feel like this UI in ideas is better.\nThat is cool to see.\nYeah.\nSo anybody listening on the pod, like basically you've got the the tree view of all the files that have changed.\nYou've got your main area that shows you like each of the the changed files and like what needed to happen for each.\nAnd then on the right hand side is almost like your chat window and Cursor that shows like each of the prompts one by one that went through and made all of these changes.\nUm, so yeah, it's, I mean, if you've been using Cursor, it's like a very intuitive UI too.\nLike you know exactly what you're looking at.\nYeah, I did post on Twitter yesterday.\nI'm like, \"Do people really like the CLIs better?\"\nAnd a lot of people were saying like it's not that you even need the CLI, like you, or sorry, it's not that you don't even need the UI.\nUm, you, you basically just these are just API endpoints.\nThere's they're bash scripts and you you want to be able to call it from something.\nYou want to be able to just call it from a node process and it will go off and run it.\nWith this, they essentially have to run like an entire VS Code instance in the cloud, I think, in order for this to work.\nSo, kind of interesting this whole new world of like not just it used to be tap, tap, tab, then it was type, type to the agent.\nUm, and now it's simply just like make a document and let the agent like blow through a couple oceans worth of water and generate some code for you.\nYeah.\nOne thing I do want to speak on though is like you're almost like able to give it like junior level, mid-level tasks here.\nLike this is kind of what maybe some companies are talking about when they're saying they're replacing junior devs or like 50% of their code is written with AI.\nLike being able to just pass an issue to an AI and then it goes off and does a bunch of work and then when it's ready you come back and you review it.\nLike I, I don't know.\nI worry about entry-level developers, will they cease to exist, and then once everyone retires, who is going to be there to replace them?\n\n\nUm, cuz like this is a task you would have. You would give, you would have given somebody that was like new to the job and like, okay, well, get familiar with like the codebase and like, but no, AI can just do it instantly. Like, you don't even have to know anything, so I don't know. Yeah, I don't know the answer to that, but we'll be here to watch. We'll be live streaming the end. Exactly. All right. Next up, uh, we've got some new features coming to the ECMAScript standard. So, they had the 108th TC39 meeting, and there were three features that actually advanced to stage 4. So, if you're not familiar with how all of this works, basically, there's different stages that a feature can be in. Um, and each one means maybe a few browsers have implemented it, maybe there's a few people on the committee that have championed it, but once it's reached stage 4, that means it will be in the next version of ECMAScript. So, these are features that are fairly newish, but you're going to be able to use them um in JavaScript soon. And the first one is Array.fromAsync. And this basically allows you to take an uh async iterable and then instantly turn it into an array. So anytime you might have done like a four await loop, typically, well, the only way to do something like this was with a four await loop where you iterate over each of the the things asynchronously, like push it into an array. But now you can use from a sync, uh, pass in a function, and you'll get back an array that has all of those uh items from the iterable in it. Yeah, that's we talked about this as well on a probably an episode that comes just before this one, and it's not something I need all of the time because like a lot of people are probably saying like, why not just use promise.all or a promise.all settled? And it's because, first of all, that only works with arrays. Um, iterables are more than just arrays. Iterables are anything that can be looped over, and also iterables can be generators where the amount of items is not yet known. So you cannot simply just await something that is is not yet known. A generator can continue generating things until it is done, right? There's literally a done property on a generator. So there's I don't know, maybe once or twice a year I hit a little thing like, damn, this is annoying that I have to like loop over it and then push them into an array before it. So this is going to be a nice little addition. Definitely. Now another one that reached stage 4 is Error.isError. Yeah, Wes is laughing. I mean, it's pretty simple, but honestly, like the the amount of hoops we jump through, like checking like instance of and like, does it have this property? And so, this is a built-in method for reliably detecting error objects. And you typically would use something like this like in a try catch. So, in the catch, make sure that actually is an error object and like it has a message property because in JavaScript, you can throw anything. And so, this will be useful to kind of like narrow that down. This this is gonna be super handy in TypeScript as well because the TypeScript error is always unknown, right? And then you have to always narrow, and it's such a pain in the butt because it's like, it's it's fine. It's probably an error, you know, and at least I can oneline it, narrow it down now. Yeah. And it they they're saying here that this is a decade in the making. They've been working on this proposal for 10 years, but finally it landed. Um, and then the last one that made it to stage 4 is Explicit Resource Management. I think you all have talked about this on the pod, but basically it's a it gives us a using statement. Um, I come from a .NET background. So in C# we had something like this where you have basically resources that might need to be disposed after they're used, and you can essentially wrap that in a using block, and then they automatically get disposed. And so what this what does that mean, disposed, like memory cleanup? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, to like uh free up your memory, remove some event listeners, uh disconnect from a database, uh any sort of like resource that you were using. In JavaScript, typically you explicitly have to disconnect from the database or remove the event listener or um explicit code that that does that. But this basically you would you'd have to structure your code slightly different because you would have to create a class that kind of like wraps the usage of that resource. But if you create an instance and say using on it, uh, the JavaScript engine will know that it needs to call the disposal method to automatically disconnect from a database or remove an event listener or different things like that. So it's it's a it's a pattern that you'd have to adopt, but it does make it so that there you don't have to explicitly do those things all the time. So when a we didn't talk about this, by the way, I'm I'm I'm just trying to understand it. So when a class is like garbage collected, then this the disposal function will then run, and you can put any cleanup you want in that function. Is that right? Um, I think it's more than my understanding is not just garbage collection, just when it's like out of scope. Um, Oh, okay. So like the it exists, it's it's it's used for as long as that variable is in scope, and then when it's no longer in scope because we marked it with using, we know that we can call the disposal function. It probably is is is aligned with garbage collection because that's the moment when that thing would be freed up when it's no longer in scope and no there's no longer any references to it. But that's basically probably some other use cases though. Yeah. But that's the signal to say, hey, we're not using this thing anymore. We can now call that dispose method that they defined and then do all of the explicit disposal that they said we should do. It's similar to like a use effect. If you return a function from a use effect, when that effect is no longer being used, i.e. its component has been unmounted, um, that cleanup function will run, and that's a good spot to remove event listeners or unsubscribe from databases or any streams that you want. Exactly. Yeah. So, similar similar idea, but it kind of brings it native to JavaScript. And we'll clean up some code bases where there was like explicit management of resources. Oh, man. My my post is in this blog post. I didn't realize that. Yeah. Yeah. So, beyond beyond just stage four things, this article also talks about uh some of the other stuff, but yeah, Wes, you want to mention the the tweet that you did? Yeah, we we talked about it in the previous episode as well, but there's a whole new random name space with like 22 different methods for being random. Um, so you want to shuffle arrays or you want to randomly pick an item from an array, but you want to weight them in different values or you want to randomly pick a number between two numbers. These are just things that we have to do all of the time. So, this is just like the Swiss Army knife. 22 different methods for working with randomness in JavaScript. As well as the ability, part of this is the ability to to seed it, which means that you can have things that are consistently random, randomly the same amount every single time. Um, and we me and Scott were talking about this is like in tests that's sometimes very important. If you want to randomly generate someone's name, you want to make sure that you get the same name every single time. Uh, so if you call random name, you get John every single time. You call it again, you get Peter every the second time that you call it. Um, and that's that's done via seeding something with randomness. Nice. And it says that that's stage two. So it might take a little bit longer to get to stage four, but all of this looks super useful. Like there's actually quite a few libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem that do similar things. So it'd be great to have this directly in the the random namespace. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm much looking forward to this, and yeah, stage two is is pretty early. Um, I think there's there's lots of feedback. People want to know if it should be cryptographically random or not. Right now it is not. Um, meaning that you shouldn't use this for anything that is like you need security for, if you want to generate like a random um like public key or something like that, that you should use the crypto libraries for that. So this is kind of interesting. Um, Frederick K. shot. We've had him on the podcast a few times. He's the creator of Astro. Um, we even have had him on the podcast before Astro. We were talking about his Snowpack bundler. He's working on an email client, which I thought was really interesting cuz I feel like we're due for like an AI-based email client. You know, I use missive and I have a bunch of AI rules in there, but my email is such a wasteland of of just garbage, not necessarily spam, but just like automated sales tactics from and cold outreach and all this like garbage stuff. So, I'm I'm curious. And he's building it in Astro, which makes sense, but also like that's really cool to see what that will look like. Big a big email app built in Astro. I mean, it makes sense because like he's one of the creators of Astro, but but but also like you never you typically you don't think about Astro in terms of like uh interactive apps. I mean, you can build them, but it when when I think of Astro, I think of like content-based websites, but technically they they do have server actions. They do have server-side rendering, like they have added a lot of features over the years that make them behave more like a traditional meta framework. Um, so it's it's not too farfetched to to use Astro for something like this. Uh, but I I just I didn't hear about this, so I just signed up for the wait list. I'd be curious to see what what uh what features they add in here because like you were saying, like being able to like, I don't know, not have to manually filter through your your inbox and it can automatically handle that because it can more intelligently filter things out. Yeah. Or search too, man. And like I've been using the Grock search on Twitter quite a bit lately, or I've been using Grock as a search tool because I often, you know, like you're like, uh, what was that email? And you're just like entering random words that you hope match in a in a certain way. And like what I would love to do is that like uh a couple years ago I felt like I talked to somebody about doing something with JavaScript on hardware and then it will like and then find me find me those email addresses. You know, I'm not trying to match the word hardware in JavaScript in an email. I want to be able to just naturally ask it what I want. And the I find I have that issue with finding old tweets as well. And the using Grock to find old tweets has been been pretty helpful. Nice. Yep. So, next up in the news, Rolldown-Vite was announced. And so if you hadn't heard, Evan You had actually got funding and started his own company called uh, was it void? Void zero. Void zero. Not v 0ero. Not not v 0ero. That's why I was like, wait, void void zero. Uh, with the idea that um, the the all of the web ecosystem, like a lot of it has kind of standardized on using Vite as their build tooling. And this company was basically going to now have actual funding to work on these kinds of things. And one of those products is Rolldown-Vite. Um, and so Vite was actually based on top of Rollup.js and esbuild, but Rolldown is a complete native implementation and API compatible implementation of of Rollup and is now a drop-in replacement for Vite. So we talked about the native port of TypeScript earlier. This is this is similar in that you can now just instantly drop it in and just get speed ups. And uh, basically you can take any any app that uses Vite, instead pull in Rolldown-Vite, and in their article they talk about there have been production build-time reductions from 3x to 16x and memory usage cut by up to 100x. Um, in the article they also showed that they ran Rolldown-Vite against some big production code bases like GitLab, where their build time went down from 2.5 minutes to just 40 seconds. Excalidraw, their build time dropped from 22 seconds to just 1.4 seconds, and then a few others. So this is really exciting, and the the blog talks about how you can do this. Basically, you just replace Vite with Rolldown-Vite, and now you instantly get some uh you get you get speed ups. I I can't believe how quickly they shipped this though, cuz it feels like they just talked about it like 6 months ago, and they're like, yeah, we're rewriting Rollup in Rust, and we're going to call it Rolldown. And if I'm just like, oh, it's here already. You know, like both the TypeScript thing and this thing is like, wow, that that was fast. It's happening. Yeah, that's that's crazy. Um, 22 seconds to 1.4 seconds. Man, that I wonder if this is even using the like the type the TypeScript Go stuff as well, right? Cuz a lot of that has to. Yeah, I I would think that maybe just to like make sure that they have good metrics, it's not. But imagine combining both, right? Because it uh anytime you have a build process, that has to run through the TypeScript compiler as well. What does it does the article say anything about TypeScript? Oh, you know what? No, they use um, they have OXC, which is their type dripper. Yeah. So they don't V does not type check. It types strips, meaning that it simply just takes the types out of the JavaScript and replaces them with spaces. Um, and then once the types are gone, it's it's just JavaScript at that point, right? Um, but the type checker is is what type the new TypeScript thing is, right? And that does it obviously will transpile it as well. But part of the big ask in the TypeScript type checker is actually saying like what are the types is this is inferred? Are there any type issues? That's what's really slow. Yeah. Or now is fast. And so I guess in the in a world where all of these things are fully compatible with everything, you probably you run them in parallel. So like TypeScript would run to make sure that all the types are correct, but Vite would be running in the background just to build everything after the types are stripped. Um, but I mean, I Yeah, I think imagining the the speed up of both of these, like we're uh it's it's a good time to be alive.\n\n\nI think. Yeah, I this\nbuild times are getting are getting\nreally fast. I was talking to at the\nmeetup some of the folks from I work on\nturbo repo and I was like what's the\nfastest build you've ever seen and like\nfrom like like commit to being live and\nhe he said at versell they they\nprovision some like crazy 32 CPU servers\nand he said that they they had a site go\nI think it was their their like shipped\nconference website I think they said he\nsaid 15 seconds or something crazy like\nthat. Yeah.\nOh, that's that's nuts. Like my own\ncourse platform, I can go from commit to\nlike being live in about\nthree or four minutes with with heavy\ncaching. Um, and that's not using any of\nthe new V or\nuh like I'm using V but not the new the\nnew rollown stuff and it's not using the\nnew TypeScript stuff as well. So I'm\ncurious how much that will improve it.\nMy biggest my biggest weight right now\nis simply just uploading the changed\nfiles um as part of the CI. Yeah, we\ndefinitely need to try it on the the\nSyntax FM website too cuz it has build\nbuild times of a couple minutes as well.\nIt would be nice to get that down to\nlike 10 seconds and then like I guess\nlike the GitHub actions start slowing\nyou down at that point, but I I think\nsome of our GitHub actions will will use\nthis as well. So, if we can speed those\nthings up as well, it would be so nice\nto get it down to like 1 minute or\nsomething like that. Yeah, definitely.\nUm, alongside this Vite news is Vite 7 is\nin beta and part of that is using the\nroll down. I I is it by default? Are you\ndo you know? I think so. I think that's\nthe the major the major bump is they're\nnow going to be switching from roll up\nto roll down. Yeah, but it it doesn't\nlook like any like breaking changes.\nThat's when we went from V four to five\nand five to six. It was just kind of\nlike cool, you know, like it just keeps\nworking. It just it's great. It's some\nbugs were fixed or whatever and and\nthere maybe a couple new features, but\nit's not like holy smokes, there's all\nthese new things I get to try and it it\njust works well. So, that's exciting.\nDefinitely. I mean, I think if you\nimagine the like the Webpack days, like\nany any new time a version was released,\nthere's a lot of breaking changes or\nlike just a lot of config changes that\nneeded to happen. I I've had that same\nexperience with V where you just upgrade\nand as long as you weren't doing\nanything crazy, it just works. Yeah.\nYeah. Even I I do some crazy stuff. My\nvcon config is like like 180 lines or\nsomething wild like that because I have\nlike bunch of legacy node stuff with pug\ntemplates and uh I have like like I\ndon't know something like 20 different\ninputs because there's 20 different\nsites, you know, like all kinds of crazy\nstuff I'm doing and it's it all just\nworks. Nice. Angular 20 has been\nreleased. Yeah, the the uh all the\nAngular folks usually chime in that we\ndon't mention Angular enough, but 20 was\nreleased. Yeah, here you go. But also\nthe I've been so far out of the loop\nthat version 20 like that's that's a\nvery big number. Yeah, I'm still reeling\nfrom 2.0. Yeah, exactly. But they\nmentioned that they stabilized some APIs\nlike effect link signal to signal. So it\nseems like the we had heard about\nAngular adopting this idea of signals\nand so a lot of that has been\nstabilized. They've got improved\ndebugging and dev tools, better\ndeveloper experience. So, good stuff's\nhappening in in the world of Angular.\nWhat's cool to see is that their signals\nimplementation is based on standards or\nmaybe the other way around. The the TC39\nsignals proposal is going to be very\nmuch in line with the signals\nimplementation. We've also heard that\nfrom spelt as well. So, I'm I I we got\nto get signals in the language, man. And\nit's great to see all of these\nframeworks like thinking ahead of if the\nAPI is going to look like this, let's\nshape ours around that. Definitely. So\njust need them in React. I guess that's\nI probably going back to the first thing\nRemix is probably mad that uh React\ndoesn't have signals. So they're\nprobably uh that's that's one big\nfeature that Pact has over React is that\nyou can use signals in in there.\nDefinitely. Uh, one last call out is,\nuh, if you haven't yet, you should take\nthe State of CSS Survey. So, this is up\nright now. Uh, this surveys developers\nthat use CSS about what features are you\nusing, what frameworks are you using,\nand we typically like to react to the\nresults. So, it'd be good to have What\npodcasts are you listening to? Who is\nyour favorite content creator? Please\njuice us up. Somebody write a bot or\nsomething so we' be number one. Yeah.\nUh, yeah, certainly check it out. Uh,\nyou can get that. What is the\nState of CSS Survey? I think you could\njust Google it. This the URL is kind of\nfunny. survey.deographics.com.\nLink in the show notes for sure. Sick.\nAll right, that's crazy amount of news\nin the last couple weeks. Hopefully you\nenjoyed that. Let us know if we missed\nanything or if there is anything that\npops up that you want us to cover, ping\nus in any way possible. Blue Sky us,\ntweet us, DM us, email us. um send us a\npiece of mail. We actually have a syntax\nPO box now. Really? Okay. You can send\nus a letter if you if you really want us\nto. So\nawesome. Cool. All right. Last thing we\nwant to talk about is Sentry. This\npodcast is presented by Sentry. You're\ngoing to want to check it out. They now\nhave logs. We have now logs. I'm stoked\nabout this because\nhaving logs is one thing for figuring\nout what's gone wrong, but having logs\nconnected to all of the other pieces of\nall your other traces. Like when\nsomething goes wrong on your website,\nthere's all these little bits of\ninformation, right? There's replay. What\ndid the user click in order to to do?\nDid they navigate to a page? They hover\nover top of something. You get a full\nvideo replay, right? There's all the\ninformation about the actual issue that\nhappened. you know, what browsers were\nbeing used and what run times and when\ndid it happen, what countries did it\nhappen in. Um, but then there's also\nlike like logs on your server as well.\nAnd having all of those connected gives\nyou like the some sort of superpower and\nthis amazing, you know, like that like\nthat meme with the red you put\neverything on a on a wall and you have\nall the red pieces of yarn connecting\neverything. Centry is going to do that\nfor you and uh you're going to want to\nput it in your application if you\nhaven't yet already. Go to\ncentry.iosynax.\nYou're going to get two months of the\nteam package for free. All right, that's\nit. Thank you for for filling in, CJ.\nThank you for all your insights on the\nnews and uh we'll catch you later.\nPeace. Peace.\n",
