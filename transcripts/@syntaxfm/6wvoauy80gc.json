  "cleanText": "Welcome to Syntax.\nWe got a special one for you today.\nYou probably saw the title, and I'm not going to spoil it for James just yet because he's probably really excited about this, but when I heard about what had happened, I thought, like, let's get him on just for a little bit on the podcast and talk about, like, what does it mean?\nWhat does this mean for Payload CMS?\nWhat does it mean that, like, why, why would Figma do this?\nAnd then third, like, like, what does the future of building full stack apps, especially with all these AI tools, look like?\nAnd I think that, um, this was part of a play in that by Figma, and we'll find out.\nSo, welcome James.\nThanks so much for coming on.\nI love being here.\nLast time was a blast.\nYeah, super fun.\nWe were, we were staying in, we had a meet up in Denver a couple weeks ago, and we're like, man, we still got to do Grand Rapids.\nUm, because I think that would be, would be pretty fun to do.\nYeah, I think if you came here, we could make a pretty big deal out of it.\nUh, we don't get a lot of interesting guests through this space, especially in the tech world, but, um, there's a little, there's a little enclave of people that would be very interested.\nSo, that'd be fun.\nCool.\nUm, well, let's, let's not beat around the bush here.\nUm, we'll do a quick intro.\nPayload CMS.\nGive us a quick intro of what that is and then tell us your announcement.\nYeah, we actually, in my head, we just refer to it as Payload, but it is a CMS.\nI think there's a huge, like, difference between Payload and any other CMS where you usually think of CMS as something to manage web pages and blog posts and media, right?\nBut, like, and they're generally not very smiled upon by engineers because they're pretty tough to work with and very rigid.\nBut Payload flips the script on all of that.\nAnd our biggest use cases are actually, like, application backends for internal tools and whatever.\nUm, so we're kind of a hybrid app framework in CMS, and it's been a lot of fun to build, but, um, we're just beginning.\nThat's exciting.\nAnd what's the big announcement?\nHit a layout.\nYeah.\nUm, I want to kind of start from the beginning here.\nPayload was actively raising a series A, and I was out, you know, going down Sand Hill Road in San Francisco doing the move and talking to a bunch of investors.\nGot some pretty interesting opportunities.\nBut Figma was interested in our series A, and I started talking to them, and it very quickly became apparent some very interesting things that we could build together, and that went, like, oh, Figma strategic investor, typical VCs, my interest kind of centered fully on Figma because of this vision that we laid out together, and yeah, it was a series A thing, but Figma and Payload are joining forces.\nAnd the things that we're going to be building over the next couple months, couple years are very, very exciting to me.\nBut yeah, Figma has officially, um, bought Payload, and now I work for Figma, which is very exciting.\nWell, congratulations.\nThat's awesome.\nSo, I guess my, my first question is, what does Figma want to do with this?\nI, I'm going to call it a CMS.\nLike, we understand that it is a suite of tools to build fullstack applications and whatnot, but, like, like, why does Figma want to buy a CMS?\nYeah.\nUm, I don't think I'm going to fight calling it a CMS either anymore.\nUm, I think that the perception of CMS should change a bit, but, um, I think that is a pretty accurate description for us.\nSo, you know, Figma is a digital design company, right?\nThey work very well with the design workflow and allow design systems to be crafted to high fidelity and exploration can be just perfected.\nBut there's still a pretty big gap between design and code.\nAnd for me personally, I don't want to compromise on any of it.\nI want to use a professional design tool for the design side of the work involved, but then I want to architect something beautifully in code that I understand, that I can build on top of in six months, and I can bring a whole team in and we can all effectively work in a system together.\nLike, the better engineered that side of it is, the more interested I am in working on it.\nAnd, um, Figma sees that, right?\nThere is currently kind of a gap between design and code.\nAnd they're making a lot of strides to closing that gap.\nBut I mean, imagine, like, a button in your design system, right?\nIt's in Figma.\nIt is beautiful.\nIt's got all the states, and you can specify, like, the appearance and the properties of the button and, like, the different varieties, but you could also go to code from that.\nLike, they just released an MCP server, which basically high fidelity, like, takes your frame and transforms it into JSX and without losing any detail.\nBut that's only half the battle.\nThere's also where does the data come from?\nLike, if you're going to connect that button to an interface for admins to be able to place that button in different pages or different areas of your, um, website, whatever it is, then you need to know about that too, right?\nYou need to know about the data, the source of the data, the shape, the types, everything.\nAnd so, to effectively close that design to code gap, a CMS is actually a pretty natural thing to slot into that equation.\nUm, and I'm really only hitting the obvious parts right now, but I think what we're going to be doing goes far beyond just, um, informing design systems.\nMhm.\nI was pretty excited when I heard this because, uh, the idea with Payload is that, like, like, it's both, like, kind of like your ORM, right?\nLike, you can, you set up your data types and your whole schema and everything like that, and then you also get, like, a, like, a UI that you can use to edit it, right?\nAnd, and those, that's not your typical, like, you log in and, like, like WordPress, you have, you have to find where that piece of data lives in the back end of it, right?\nThey're, they're a little bit more connected, and AI is, is so good at writing, like, like you said, it's so good at writing JSX, and it's so good at writing interactive applications, but wouldn't it be especially, like, AI is so good at NexJS as well, right?\nIt's, it can spit out components, we've seen Vzero is very good at that.\nUm, but, like, the one step further is, is what if it was, like, totally trained on something that could save data?\nUm, I know GitHub had something like that that they're, they're kind of working on as well, but, like, going that one step further of it's able to spit out souped to nuts, absolutely everything.\nLike, kind of right now, we're just, like, in the, the, the application, right?\nAnd it can write some backend code and whatnot, but with this, at least I see it, is that it's, it's pushing it a little bit further into the, like, saving to database and and being able to manage your data side.\nAnd then what I, I hope comes of this is it goes a little bit further in the other side, which is it's, it's hooked into, like, the actual design of the application as well, right?\nUm, I was laughing because I need to look up the origin of the phrase soup to nuts.\nI don't know what that could possibly have come from, but, um, yeah, so for Payload, we haven't really started focusing on this yet, but one thing that I know that is true is that large language models work best when they can use systems that have predefined guardrails for business logic, and this is how you do this, this is how you do that, and you write this, and then you get all this, right?\nAnd that's why it outputs Tailwind 99% of the time, right?\nYeah.\nUm, and that's also why it works well with declarative frameworks like, like JSX, right?\nBut Payload has our config, which is declarative.\nIt takes the complexity and makes it simple.\nYou don't have to open up your own endpoints like in a typical MVC world.\nYou define your models and your views and your controllers and all of that stuff, and you basically wire it up all from scratch, right?\nAnd that's a lot of complexity.\nEven though it's a framework and it makes something simple, makes them maintainable, you still have a lot of code and it's verbose.\nWhereas with Payload, you just define your schema, and then you get your whole set of APIs, and you get your entire admin UI, and you get everything that is derived from that one config, which an LLM should be able to output very accurately, and the result of the code that the LLM outputs is within the confines of predefined business logic.\nRight?\nSo, it's not creating something from scratch.\nYou know, an LLM, it is very good at writing raw SQL queries, but is that really the future is an LLM is going to write raw SQL queries for every single thing that your app needs to do?\nProbably not, right?\nUm, and so I think that's kind of a superpower of ours.\nI think you will see us double down on that.\nBut ultimately, one thing I also feel pretty passionately about is that large language models will automate a lot of what we do and make it easier to be efficient while we work as engineers.\nBut I personally have a great interest in not surrendering engineering perfection to something else, right?\nAnd in certain complexity levels, an LLM will be able to get you going.\nBut then you as the author of this product can enforce architecture that ultimately makes it more efficient and that makes it better organized and, um, more dry.\nAnd those types of things are really interesting to me.\nI don't want to sacrifice on my ability to get in there and clean and to organize, right?\nSo it'll play together, I think.\nAnd if you want to see all of the errors in your application, you'll want to check out Sentry at sentry.io/syntax.\nYou don't want a production application out there that, well, you have no visibility into in case something is blowing up and you might not even know it.\nSo, head on over to sentry.io/syntax.\nAgain, we've been using this tool for a long time and it totally rules.\nAll right, the space of building sites.\nLet's talk about that right now.\nIs, like, the, or maybe the interface of, of building sites right now, right?\nYou see, there, there's, there's chat apps, right?\nYou got Bolt and Vzero and Lovable and and things like that where, where you type into the chat box and it kicks something out out the other end.\nUm, and then the other hand, we've got, like, a cursor, which is you've got agents and you kind of tell it what you want it to do.\nAnd then there's, there's several other sort of implementations of, like, what does the interface of building a website look like?\nUm, and then throwing design into the mix as well.\nWhat are, I know you don't have concrete plans of, of what this will look like specifically in Figma, but I just in general, like, what do you think is a, the interface of building sites will look like?\nYeah, I mean, I can give you a parable.\nSo I have obviously used all of these, um, vibe coding tools, and I think they're incredible, right?\nLike, they can do a lot, and clearly the industry is changing, and there's real opportunity here.\nAlthough one time I was building a proof of concept for a prospect of Payload, and I don't want to write Tailwind classes myself, like, I don't find that enjoyable.\nI don't want to write, like, HTML structures.\nI want to, like, if I can take a shortcut to get through that part, I'm going to take that shortcut.\nAlthough, so I tried to use, I was using cursor.\nI was like, I personally did the back end in Payload because I was excited about it, but then when it came to, like, the JSX on the front end, I was like, oh, god, I've done this so many times, I don't want to do it again.\nYeah.\nAnd so the front end was purely cursor's responsibility, right?\nAnd it was like a checkout, like, multi-step form, right?\nSo you have step one, like, I don't know, shipping address, step two, billing info, step three, review, step four, congrats.\nAnd I had this, like, Figma design, and it was like three circles or four circles with, like, step labels, right?\nEverybody's done this with, like, a little line that connects the circles, and the first step highlights the first one.\nAnd I had this JPEG, and I'm uploading it to cursor.\nI'm like, please, please make sure that the line that connects the dots is centered vertically and make the space have enough space for each label so that, like, step one, billing info.\nAnd I gave it the design intent, but it just could not hit what I wanted to do.\nAnd by this point, I'm not writing Tailwind.\nI'm not going to get in there and clean up this AI generated code.\nLike, please, just can we get there with Vibes?\nAnd we did not get there with Vibes.\nAnd I actually had to, like, stop trying because it just was getting worse.\nAnd I was spending a lot of money.\nAnd, like, I think the fidelity of going from something that's well-designed and deliberate to code has lots of areas of improvement.\nLike, if I have something that's already deliberate, I know what it needs to be.\nI've designed it exactly how I want it.\nThere's a lot of opportunity there to, um, continue to invest in the fidelity, which also has data ramifications as well.\nRight?\nSo, um, to really create a seamless process that not only allows you to get to an MVP, but also allows you to continue extending and building and maintaining, you kind of need to know about all these different pieces alto together.\nAnd so I think the future will have, um, it will require a system that can be well trained for specific goals, and design is where it starts, right?\nThat is, you, I don't know if I've told you this before, but I started as a designer, like, that is, that is my history, um, so I feel very passionately about, like, the good products will start with intent, they will start with explicit, um, goals, and those goals and that intent will be designed, and so, um, I'm very interested in Payload actually having the ability to connect to design in more natural ways.\nThat'll be the future.\nInteresting.\nInteresting.\nAnd something I've heard several times, which I'm not sure I buy, or part of me is like, that kind of makes sense, and part of me is like, no, no, is the fact that design or UI will not be something that is the same for everyone, meaning that the UI may be generated as you need it.\nYou know, like, I want to build my own UI for for Twitter or something like that.\nAnd part of me is like, that sounds great, but the part of me is like, most people don't know what they want.\nAnd then the other part people say is that, like, there will be no UI.\nIt's just MCP servers all the way down and you just simply talk to it back and forth.\nUh, do you have any thoughts on either the generated or the just the no UI as well?\nWell, I think there will always be some sort of visual interface.\nYeah, doesn't, it's never just going to be text, right?\nLike, as soon as you introduce any type of imag\n\n\nVery, video assets, brand, tone of\nvoice, uh, experiences will need to be\ncrafted, no matter what.\nI do think that there's a world where we just talk to\nour devices and like they do what we\nneed, but they're still going to\ncommunicate with you, right?\nThey're going to get, it's going to be a back and\nforth.\nAnd so there will be an interface,\naesthetic, uh, brand, tone of voice, all\nthose things.\nAs far as somebody\ncreating their own interface for\nsomething like Twitter X, it's been\nyears.\nI should just get on that train.\nUm, I, uh, I can't even, I, I, I don't say\nit, but I also don't apologize.\nI know\nwhat people are saying.\nAll right, I'm\ngoing to do that from now on Twitter.\nLike there's this famous like modal on X\nthat there's an X button to close the\nwindow, but then there's the X icon\nwhich is the logo.\nWhich one do I click?\nThis is insane.\nYeah, I think there will be like human\ninterface 3.0 coming soon, right?\nLike\nthe touchscreen was a big evolution of\ninterface design, but there is another\nwave of interface design that's coming\nthat none of us can really fully predict\nright now.\nBut I do feel pretty\nconfident knowing that each one will\nneed to be deliberate, customized,\ncomplex, and have a lot of jobs to do.\nThat you can't just cowboy your way into\nlike, oh, I want X to work this way,\nright?\nLike that's, that's going to be, uh,\nI don't know that I buy that either.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI agree.\nI'm, I'm kind\nof excited about this cuz\nlike a lot of the like AI generated apps\ndo look good because a lot of them are\nbuilt with ShadCN, and ShadCN looks\nawesome.\nUm, but they all do look\nsomewhat similar because people don't go\nfurther and customize them for, for what\nit is that they need.\nSo, I think like\nputting that into the mix of like being\nable to document it and and play around\nin a design tool and then push that into\nyour your code and like keep those lanes\nopen as well.\nYou know, what happens if\nI change something in one spot and and\nthen they're synced?\nWell, um, there, I\nthink we should kind of disseminate\nbetween two different types of\napplications.\nIt's like there is the\nsmall application that you need to get\nup and running quickly and then there is\nthe massive enterprise design system\nthat's very deliberate and branded that\nneeds to be pervasive across 16,000\ndifferent digital footprints, right?\nAnd\neight different frameworks and Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd so yeah, eight different\nframeworks, like you might have like a\nSwift app that has the same look and\nfeel as the web equivalent and they need\nto be consistent.\nSo there's that common\ndenominator of the design system that\nneeds to pervade both of those surfaces.\nUm, and so you know, for, for the the Shad\nCN, like number one, I love what they're\ndoing and I think it has a lot of value.\nI don't even think that there's a\nproblem with certain apps looking and\nfeeling in the same way.\nNo, prove that\nthat consistent UI is good.\nRight.\nRight.\nBut that doesn't negate the need\nto have a well-defined system especially\nfor scale.\nAnd those are two different\noutcomes.\nThose are two different goals,\nright?\nUm, I've always liked systems.\nI've always liked working on larger\nprojects that need to be thought through\ncarefully.\nUm, and that's I think that's\nwhy Payload is good because it allows\nfor that type of thinking and it\nencourages it.\nBut yeah, there's both\nreally, there will perpetually be both of\nthose, uh, different worlds.\nLet's talk\nabout people who are using Payload right\nnow are probably watching this and\nsaying like what's going to happen to\nPayload?\nUm, so what's going to happen to\nPayload?\nI'm still running it.\nThe whole team is\nand it will remain open source.\nI, you\nknow, early on with conversations with\nthe Figma team who have been fantastic.\nThey were very clear about like we love\nthe open- source community that you've\nbuilt.\nThese, this community is fired up.\nThey are making poll requests.\nThey are\ncontributing to RFC's on GitHub.\nThey\nare helping shape your product.\nThe\nengagement is incredible.\nAnd the open-\nsource nature of the product is very\nimportant to us.\nAnd Figma as a company,\nI think they've always wanted to do more\nin open source.\nAnd they want to foster\nthis.\nThey Payload will remain open\nsource.\nI think it's easier now than it\never has been to deploy Payload wherever\nyou want.\nYou can put it on Vercel\nbecause obviously we're Nex.js.\nYou can\nput it on Netlify.\nYou can put it on a\ncontainer.\nYou can spin up an EC2 and\nmanage your entire Linux whatever\nyourself if you want to.\nThat will\nremain.\nPayload as a core framework is\nkind of like layers of an onion where\nPayload as the centerpiece where we\nmaintain all of our config and our\nbusiness logic and our access control\nand our hooks, like that doesn't even\nknow that nex.js exists, right?\nLike\nPayload itself does not have a\ndependency on React or nex.js, but then\nif you want to go with nex.js, then boom\nthere's that nex.js JS package that\nallows you to use the router and all\nthat stuff, but the core Payload\nframework is going to be built on and\nit's going to be integrated into new\nways inside of the Figma ecosystem and\nit's going to be maintained.\nIt's going\nto be doubled down on.\nIt will still be\nfree and open source, but it will power\na lot more.\nSo, it's going to get a lot\nmore exposure, a lot more usage, a lot\nmore eyesight, and I'm pretty excited\nabout that.\nI, I, I see very clearly where\nwe're going and I think everybody's\ngoing to like it.\nAnd when you say power\na lot more, like what does that, what does\nthat look like?\nUm, so\nbeing that we are called a CMS, right?\nCMS\nis often thought of as the core thing in\na marketer workflow, not necessarily a\ndeveloper workflow, right?\nSo there are a\nlot of opportunities, like when we talk\nto customers, they want AB testing, they\nwant, um, better asset management, right?\nSo\nlike there's entire different like tool\necosystems called digital asset\nmanagement, DAM, and you upload a bunch of\nassets and you mark, these ones are\npublic, these ones are private, these\nones like the brand team has signed off\non, whatever.\nBut then you want to use\nthem in your CMS.\nAnd like there's an\nentire another side of this.\nLike the\ndata in your CMS needs to connect to\nyour design system.\nIt needs to be\nintegrated with other surface areas that\nthe rest of your team can use.\nNot just\ndevelopers, but also the marketing team\nor content managers or anything.\nAnd if\nyou think about Figma as an ecosystem,\nthere's so much potential there, right?\nLike imagine a frame in Figma.\nYou click\nthat frame and export an asset to your\nCMS, right?\nAnd it's linked so that if\nthe designer goes and updates that\nframe, then the asset is automatically\nupdated and used on your homepage of\nyour website or something like that.\nThe\necosystem is huge, right?\nSo Payload as\nan app framework is already damn good\nand that will get better, but there's\njust a whole world of potential\nopportunities to make that brainstorm,\ndesign, build, publish, brainstorm,\ndesign, build, publish, that, that loop\nthere.\nYeah.\nUm, connected and seamless.\nI'm pretty excited about all that.\nOh,\nthat's awesome.\nI never even thought\nabout that.\nBut it, it's true that\nthe, the people use Figma in many\ndifferent ways, you know, it's not just\na, not just a design tool.\nThe, the amount\nof like slide decks now that I see or\nlike little pitches or like\npresentations that are are done in\nFigma, it's like, &quot;Oh, wow.\nI, I think I\nI realize that this is not just a build\nsome buttons on and and and export them\nfor\nin CSS, you know, right?&quot;\nYeah.\nAnd I\ndon't have a full answer to what are we\ngoing to build over the next five plus\nyears, but I can tell you that it's\ngoing to be things that only we can do.\nAnd that is another part of the the\ndecision factor of like, okay, are we\ngoing to raise a series A?\nAre we going\nto keep growing?\nAre we going to keep\ntaking investor funding?\nAre we going to\nbe another CMS face in the crowd?\nThere's a million of them, right?\nOr can\nwe truly do things and fix different\nproblems that no one else has even\nthought about before?\nRight?\nAnd that I\ntruly think that we're, we're moving in\nthat direction and that we don't need to\nmake any compromises at all as we do it.\nI don't want to make compromises.\nI want\ndevelopers to have the tool that they\nwant.\nI want designers to have the tool\nthat they want.\nI want them to work well\ntogether and finally remove some of that\nfriction between those two processes.\nAnd then once there, once the product is\nbuilt, it needs to be maintained and\noperated by an entirely different set of\npeople.\nSo I just think there's a lot of\nopportunity to fix things in this\nindustry that haven't ever been fixed\nbefore.\nWow.\nWell put.\nNo, I mean I think\neverybody's gut reaction is that Payload\nis going to be paid and you're never\ngoing to be able to use Payload open\nsource again.\nAnd that's just not true.\nThat is very important to us that we're\ngoing to, um, continue to protect the open\nsource nature of Payload.\nI think you're\ngoing to see a lot of design to code\nimprovements.\nI think you're going to\nsee a lot of native connections to tools\nthat you already use, a lot of\ninvestment in, um, large language models\noutputting the config.\nJust a lot of, lot\nof good, good stuff.\nSick.\nWell, I'm\nsuper stoked to see what you guys build.\nUm, super excited and congratulations\nagain for you.\nI'm sure you're, you're\nexcited to get going and and start\nbuilding all this stuff.\nI'm sure that\nwas not a, I'm sure that was a very long\nprocess.\nUm, and now I'm, you probably\njust want to get heads down and start\nbuilding stuff.\nYeah.\nUh, the team has\nbeen busy in the meantime.\nI mean, this\nhas been in the works for a while.\nAnd\nwe've shipped folder view, we've shipped\norderable collections, we've shipped\nmore join field features.\nLike all those\nfeatures, everything we've been doing\nrecently has been in parallel to all of\nthis.\nAnd I had my second kid a couple\nmonths ago, so I have a newborn at home\nthat, uh, it's, it's been a lot.\nUm,\ncongrats.\nBut yeah, I'm excited to\nbuild.\nSick.\nSick.\nCool.\nWell, um,\nhopefully we'll be able to come down.\nIf\nif you are listening to this and you\nwant to see us in Grand Rapids, let us\nknow because, uh, we, we've been talking\nabout doing a world tour.\nAnd I've been,\nI was telling them I was like, we should\ndo Michigan because Scott's from\nMichigan.\nHe can visit his family.\nUh,\nso we'll, we're gonna try and make it\nhappen.\nAll right.\nUm, are we doing a\nsick pick?\nBecause that just gave me an\nidea.\nUm, yes.\nYeah.\nLet give it.\nWhat's\nyour sick pick?\nLet lay it on us.\nWell,\nmy first choice was going to be my\nmotorcycle because it's perfect and I\nwant to buy a new one, but I don't have\nanything to buy because mine's already\nperfect.\nThat's the Triumph Street\nTriple.\nBut the real idea that you just\ngave me was that if anybody wants to\nstop by Michigan, there's this thing\ncalled Malort, which is really good.\nIt's a liquor that is from Chicago.\nThat\nis kind of a thing around here.\nBut\nyou'll find out what that means.\nAnd\nthat's my sick pick.\nMore for sure.\nOh man.\nExtremely fast motorcycle and\nsome alcohol.\nThose are some great sick\npicks.\nPlease do not enjoy those at the\nsame time.\nNo, no, no.\nDifferent times.\nAwesome.\nWell, thanks so much for coming\non.\nAppreciate, uh, you giving us the\nlittle bit of a scoop on this.\nAnd\ncongrats again.\nThank you.\nAnd thanks\nfor having me.\nI hope you're well.\nPeace.\nSee you later.\n",
