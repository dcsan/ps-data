today.\nUh, we all created our own CAPTCHAs for Kitboga’s Code Jam.\nSo, the idea is that Kitboga, a well-known YouTuber, he will scam scammers, and he has these most hilarious CAPTCHAs that are meant to be so infuriating and waste their time.\nSo, all three of us went and built our own CAPTCHA to submit to this.\nAnd today, we're going to go through them and show what we've built, try them out.\nSo, who's first?\nAll right.\nSo, this first one actually, uh, violates the rules here.\nI ended up making two.\nSo, Wes is going to be trying my violation one, and I'm very sad about that because I thought this was really funny.\nWes, uh, you will need to give this microphone access.\nI will tell you that right now, which is why it breaks the rules.\nAll right, let's give it a shot.\nSing your note.\nSing your note.\nOh, no.\nStart singing.\nOkayoo.\nThat's amazing.\nYou got it.\nOh, my god.\nHow did you make that?\nOh, my god.\nWell, you're just basically, you're capturing samples, and then you're analyzing it to say how close is it to this frequency, and then you're saying if it's within this frequency range, and I will tell you the problem that this one is so hard because if it wasn't like, if the frequency range wasn't long enough, you just like could not get it.\nIt was like\n[Music]\nI don't What's F sharp?\nJust F a little sharper.\nI I don't know what.\nSo, find an F and then make it a little higher.\nWell, wait till you see it on the screen.\nTry to hold one pitch.\nYou're too loud or too high.\nI think Yeah, there.\nThat's honestly hilarious, and I can't believe I got it so quickly the first time.\nI'm shocked.\nHonestly, I picked you because I thought you would have the hardest time with it in terms of like, you're thinking like, I want to get scammers trying to sing on camera.\nTo me, that is like hilarious.\nAnd I'm so sad that you're not allowed to use get user media in this challenge because I thought that was very funny.\nUh, and I I was having a blast building this one.\nSo, that is a genius idea.\nThat's amazing.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nThis next one I made kind of with Scott in mind.\nSo,\nOh, great.\nUh, when you start it, it presents you with a word problem that you will need to solve.\nOkay.\nAnd you can't just like copy paste into chat GPT and give you the answer.\nUh, you'll see once you start it, you actually have to choose from drop downs to complete the calculation.\nOh, Edna, famous for her meticulous wait a minute cookies.\nOh, my gosh, this is a long TJ.\nThis is a long word problem.\nExactly.\nYou got to you got to you got to parse it out.\nOkay.\nYeah, she needs exactly 169 special vanilla beans.\nThey're not just vanilla beans.\nThey're not just beans.\nThey're special vanilla beans.\nYes.\nAnd old Jabadiah, not just Jebidiah, once mentioned.\nSo, did you just add a bunch of extraneous words into this to make it more\nso there's a lot of red herrings, but there's a lot of Kitboga references in here, too.\nSo, like Edna and Jebidiah are characters that he normally plays.\nOkay.\nAnd like, wait a minute.\nIt might be too obvious, but it's funny.\nExactly.\n169.\nOkay.\nSo, two of these values need to equal 169.\nEach cost um use 73 beans per badge, but Edna is sticking to her known quantities.\n17 73 beans.\nCan I get Can I give you a hint?\nRead the whole problem first and then decide what you're going to latch on to, cuz you're latching on to a lot of extra stuff.\nI think what you don't understand is that my memory can only hold like 10 words at a time.\nA few moments later, she only buys the necessary number of full packs.\nYeah.\nSo, you can see I I give you your calculation.\nIt's some number divided by some number times some number minus some other number.\nSo, it gets you a little bit closer.\nYou you kind of know what you're at.\nSo,\nI just pasted the entire app into chat GPT, and it gave me what values to select, and I got through it.\nFascinating.\nSo, like you copy pasted the question and you're like, give me the calculation or\nNo, I I literally right-clicked on the CAPTCHA container, copied all of the HTML, pasted it into chat GPT, and it told me which uh values to select.\nOh, Wes, I'm going to need your help here.\nAnd by your help, I mean ChatGpt's help, cuz I'm never going to get I'll tell you right now.\nWe'll be here.\nWell, here's the thing.\n362 / 42.\nGo ahead and try to select 362.\nYeah, that doesn't exist because every time you load, it's new variables for all of the placeholders.\nOh, yeah.\nSo, CJ, this is diabolical.\nThere's different number of cookies.\nThere's Yeah, it's\nOh, this is funny.\nSo, does this violate rules?\nNo, it's it's all javascript.\nSo, it's just a JSON file that describes the problem, describes the variables, and then I'm doing a bunch of replace for the variables.\nCJ, this thing rips.\nThis is hilarious.\nThis fits the brief so well.\nIf I was a scammer, I would I would honestly throw my computer out the window.\nThis is so reasonable that it could be a real CAPTCHA, but at the same time, it is insane.\nOh, my god.\nThank you.\nAnd right now, I only there's only one problem, but I have it laid out.\nSo, I'm going to create a like several other problems that will just work work with this because it reads it from a JSON file.\nSo, like it puts the variables, it it creates the calculation, gives you the drop downs.\nYeah, I can help you get the answer though.\nOkay.\nSo, uh, she needs 169.\nSo, it's going to be 169 divided by 13 divided by price uh number per pack.\nYes.\nAnd then you're multiplying that by the total price per pack.\nTotal price per pack.\nUh, which is $68.\nYeah.\nAnd then you're subtracting the discount, which is $10.\nYes.\nAnd that should get you the answer.\nAnd here's an extra little bit.\nUh, it gives you a nice description of why that was the answer.\nThat is amazing.\nSo far, these are absolutely delivered.\nAll right.\nThis is my little bit of a game that starts fun and gets absolutely infuriating.\nGrill the items to perfection.\nOkay.\nOh, my god.\nYeah.\nSo, I'm doing this one.\nYou got to click on start cooking first.\nOkay.\nStart cooking.\nOh, there's sound.\nOkay.\nAre they cooking?\nI guess.\nCan I Oh.\nOh, this this puts them onto the grill.\nOkay.\nSo, I got to get that to 155.\nOh, 15 seconds.\nI see.\nSo, seconds.\nBeautiful.\nYes.\nYes.\nThese are so long though.\nOkay.\n35 seconds.\nI know.\nThat's the thing.\nAnd if you There's uh each item can have a certain amount of cook time.\nburned it.\nOh, you burned it.\nOh, I thought it was 35.\nIt was just 3 seconds.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThe hilarious part now is that now that you've burned something, you must now cook the rest of the items before you can restart.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nYou have to restart if you burn.\nThree, four, five.\nYou can put multiple items on burned it.\nYep.\nYes.\nOkay.\nGot to cook this steak longer.\nYou got to retry.\nOh, wait.\nOh, wait.\nNo, cuz I failed them.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nLet's try again.\nWhere did you get the sound for these?\nThe order up and all that stuff.\nAll the sounds are from 11 Labs.\nThey have like a an audio generator where you just type in what you want.\nSo, these are all generated sounds.\nPixel artist chat GPT.\nYes.\nYou can't really tell, but the items get progressively darker with the CSS mask.\nYeah, I couldn't tell with the mask, but dude, this is a work of art.\nSteak is decent, but not perfect.\nCan I put it back?\nOh, you burned it.\nThat sound is too much for me.\nThat's a sensory overload.\nAwesome.\nHoly.\nThat was a work of art.\nAre the seconds randomized each time or is it the same amount for each time?\nNo, there.\nSo, you can set for every item, you can set how many seconds and the variation.\nSo, the steak has to be done within like .3 seconds, but it's also 15.\nGosh.\nSee if I can just get the steak.\nI'll be happy if I can get the steak.\n14.\nNo, that's mine.\nIt's an order up.\nNo, it's okay.\nNo, it has to be green.\nDang it.\nAnd then you you can't like\nI burned it again.\nI can't I can't\nOh, my word.\nAwesome.\nNo.\nOkay, I'm done.\nI can't I can't.\nOkay.\nActually, I have a funny idea.\nYeah.\nRandy, would you be interested in doing my caption?\nOh, for sure.\nOh, okay.\nCuz Ry's the only person I think will actually be able to get this.\nSo,\nOh, no.\nThere's no music one.\nIt's going to be embarrassing, isn't it?\nIt's not going to be embarrassing.\nAnd I actually think you'll do you'll do just fine.\nHere's my actual submission because the last one violated some rules, and we're going to toss this one to producer Randy because I'm not sure the other guys will be able to solve this one.\nIn fact, I know Wes will not be able to.\nSo, I wanted to give Randy a chance to be able to solve this.\nAnd uh, this one actually is configurable, and I am giving you the hardest version of it, but\nOh, great.\nI think you'll be just fine.\nYeah, no pressure.\nHere we go.\nPlease.\nOkay, we got a few.\nOh, okay.\nHere we go.\nThis is easy.\nAdditional.\nOkay, here we go.\nYeah.\nTry it.\nTry it again.\nThere's There's a whole bunch of chords.\nHit it with a refresh.\nNow you got to play the green just aren't resetting.\nThere we go.\nYeah.\nOopsies.\nGot to take that one.\nOkay.\nHere we go.\nWhat?\nCan Can you describe your process, Randy?\nCuz it's like\nOh, sorry.\nYeah.\nSo, I think I need to build a chord starting from the root.\nYeah.\nI should say that you do need to start the chord from the root.\nSee, I was trying to build it in an inversion.\nSo, E minor 7.\nSo, we need an E, we need a G, we need a B, and we need a D.\nThere we go.\nNice.\nYeah.\nThis is why I picked you, Randy, cuz I feel like CJ and Wes would just be guessing.\nI I don't know that I've ever actually seen somebody do this.\nLike, how does piano How does a piano work?\nI So, I play a little bit, but I I don't have all the theory.\nBut that's why like it's kind of mathematical.\nIt's like, so this is a minor 7.\nSo A would be your root and then it's a minor.\nSo it's is it C natural?\nIt's a C natural.\nYeah.\nAnd then the seventh is like seven from A.\nAnd it's like ABC to E F G.\nSo seven from A would be\nYeah.\nSo, if we count up 1 2 3 up top.\nThose Yeah.\nIf this was an A major chord, you'd have the C sharp instead.\nOkay.\nBut we need the G for the seventh here.\nOh, my gosh, this is fun.\nI'm so glad I picked\nBrings me right back to school.\nIt's great.\nI like it.\nI like the little the little boops, too.\nThey sound nice.\nYes.\nYeah.\nIt plays a little tone.\nPlays a little sign tone.\nIs that using audio context to generate those?\nIt is.\nYeah.\nNice.\nOh, man.\nRandy could be a scammer.\nOh, yeah.\nThank you, Randy.\nI got to say, the music is a lot more pleasant in this one than in Wes's.\nThat was a bit too much.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nMine is so unnerving.\nLike I had to turn it off while I was developing cuz it was just like stressing me out.\nAll I could think of is a bunch of scammers in a room listening to Wes's all coming through the speakers.\nYou're burning it.\nAll right.\nSo, this one was inspired by XKCD.\nUm, and so this is XKC number 2228.\nUh, and it says, &quot;To prove you're a human, click on all the photos that show places you would run for shelter during a robot uprising.&quot;\nUm, so the idea being that like a bot wouldn't know the right images to select.\nSo, I came up with lots of different prompts that are similar that maybe only only humans could do.\nSo, like the images depicting a place you'd hide your most embarrassing childhood story.\nDiary book.\nOh, diary.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI would have to imagine a vault.\nDo you have access to a vault as a child?\nI don't.\nYeah.\nUh drawer.\nBest drawer.\nDrawer.\nTop left.\nYeah.\nYou missed the drawer.\nSo\nOh.\nUh, and you have to get three of them right.\nAnd it's going to keep cycling through them uh until you get at least three right.\nSelect all images that depict a situation would be a minor inconvenience.\nTop left.\nUh spilling.\nUh yeah, that's minor.\nLow battery.\nThat's minor.\nOh yeah.\nUh not having anywhere to hold your hands on the subway.\nYeah, that's minor.\nYeah, I think that's it cuz the computer one isn't a minor cut.\nOkay.\nPaper cut.\nI missed the answer.\nNo.\nYeah, I you technically the spilling.\nI mean, I guess it did say minor inconvenience, but spilling on your laptop is also a minor inconvenience, I guess.\nMake you feel.\nThat's not minor at all.\nThat puts you out of work.\nThat's major.\nMake you vague\n\n\nSense of existential dread. I\ncannot handle that. I can't handle\nexistential dread. Oh man.\nWhich? Yeah,\nthis is subjective. Each of you can tell\nme which of these make you feel like\nexist.\nBottom right, middle, right, top\nright,\ntop, middle, and I think that's it for\nme personally.\nAll right.\nYou're you're missing a few. So, the\nidea is it's I think this is the\nlast one and then it'll cycle through\nand you got to try again. Oh,\nokay. So,\nyou'll you'll probably get them over\ntime.\nYeah. Uh, items you would not find\nin your soup. So, what did you use to\ngenerate these?\nI used midjourney.\nOh,\nspider. Spider.\nOh, yeah. Definitely.\nYeah, you don't want that in your soup.\nAll right. I think you guys are really\ngood at identifying things in your soup.\nYeah. Yeah, it's a good one.\nBoom. I\nknow my soup.\nGreat. Now, you got to get two more. Uh\nOh, this is one.\nOh my god. You got to\nget two more. You got to get\nYes. This\nis off. CJ, yours are like like so long.\nLike this would take absolutely forever.\nThey're supposed to. Yeah. So, select\nall images you'd use as a wallpaper to\nseem adventurous.\nOh my gosh, these are\nawesome.\nGuys, you have all outdone\nyourselves with these. These are just\nthe funniest.\nI might need to fix that. I think the\nbeach is adventurous. You got it.\nYes.\nTake that, scammers. Guys, we should do\nthis again sometime just for fun because\nthat was an absolute blast. I really\nsincerely enjoyed all of your captures\nand what a wide range of styles we all\ndid for this, too. So, that's Man, that\nis hilarious. Get boa, if you like\nthese, let us know.\nWe'll we'll leave\nyou today with producer Randy attempting\nto hit a a note on Scott's capture.\nThere we go. We're in.\nNice.\nTook a\nlittle get there, but we we got\nThat is\nhow you do it, though. That is how you\ndo it.\n",
