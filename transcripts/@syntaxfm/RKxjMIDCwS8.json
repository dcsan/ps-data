  "cleanText": "Welcome to Syntax. Today we have an episode on, we're going to call it Full Stack Cloudflare, which is big fan of Cloudflare. We've got CJ on today. Scott's not feeling greatest, so CJ's filling in. And turns out CJ also is a big Cloudflare fan, right CJ?\n\nIt's true. Yeah, I mean, I actually didn't use Cloudflare much until last year. Before that, I kind of only knew them as like DNS setup, but then last year I started working with Hono and then learned about all the, they have like Key Value workers in D1. Yeah, it's just crazy. It's kind of crazy. Like, for those who don't know, Cloudflare is a, I think everybody knows them as the like DOS DNS protector, but they're really a bit of like an AWS competitor, you know? And they have so many different products to a point where you can pretty much build, you can build an entire full stack application just on Cloudflare products. And they're kind of unique in that all of their products are slightly different than the norms, but because of the way that they approach things, if you're willing to sort of approach it in a Cloudflare way, you can get huge benefits in terms of cost. It's relatively cheap and performance as well, where you can sometimes just get crazy things up and running with just a couple, couple lines of code.\n\nUm, I did just get a message from Scott. Scott bun his head when he was snowboarding, which is my greatest fear. Um, and uh, so he's, he's not feeling too great right now, so that's why CJ is filling in.\n\nYeah, you know what is supportive with Cloudflare is Sentry. Uh, if you are going to be running code in Cloudflare, you're going to want to turn on the Sentry integration so you'll get some air exception, you get all the details about what's going on with your, your application if there's anything that goes wrong and you can fix it right away.\n\nAll right, so I thought like CLF has bazillions of products, but like we're going to sort of tackle explaining the ones that are, you're a web developer, you want to build a full stack application, these are the ones that you should, you should know about. They have several like what I'll call primitives, which is like their sort of like low-level product, like a like a worker for running JavaScript code or a stat R2 for holding static assets or their D1 for holding a myql database or, or sorry, SQL light database. And then they also have several products that are sort of like built on top of their primitives, which are like handy little features. Um, and that's not uncommon. AWS is kind of has, has the same offering in terms of both low-level as well as higher-level things.\n\nSo workers, that's the first one. Uh, workers is their JavaScript runtime. It's their, their server. They don't like it when you call it serverless or Edge functions, but it's essentially the way that you can run uh, server code on Cloudflare is you create what's called a worker. And the way that it works is it takes in a request that's coming in, performs some operation, and then sends the request out the other end, very similar to how a serverless function would work. Um, it sort of spins up, does its work, and then it will spin down, meaning that it's not like a typical server where it's running all the time.\n\nYeah, and this was interesting for me to like wrap my head around once I got used to it, and really I got used to it because of Hono. Yeah, but the, the whole thing is like, it's literally a JavaScript module that exports a fetch function. That's all it is. And that one fetch function handles every single incoming and outgoing request, uh, which is why something like Hono is useful because it basically gives you the ability to like create routes like you're used to in Express, uh, instead of having to like have a bunch of if statements inside of that like just fetch function that you're desing.\n\nYeah, if you, if you like, like raw dog a Cloudflare worker, you just get the whole request object, which I'm a big fan of that. It's like, it's all standardized, right? It's based on the, the fetch API. You, if you've, if you've worked with a fetch request in the past, you, you probably already know the, the thing, but there's no, there's no, um, framework there, right? There's no router there, there's nothing. It's simply just you send the data back, you got to set all the headers yourself, and you probably don't want to do that. You probably want to reach for something with a little bit more helpers, which we'll talk about the different things. Hono probably the biggest one, but there's all kinds of different ones, including a new one called Orange JS, which is pretty nifty.\n\nYeah, and it supports, we'll talk about it, but it supports other Frameworks too. Yes. So Cloudflare workers runs on, not on node. Um, it's a JavaScript runtime environment, but they've built their own, um, which has V8 as an engine. So similar to how Bun or Dino is, not no, Cloudflare workers is also not node. They do have mostly node compat at this point. They've went for many years trying to be like, same thing with Dino as well, many years being like, use the standards, and I'm, I'm very much about using the standards, but they also packages and stuff just use node APIs at the end of the day. So they have pretty close to full node compat, um, with the exception of several things with like socket connections. They, they have their own version of that. Uh, there's no file system access in Cloudflare workers because there is no file system. So if, if you're using that, you got to think around that. Um, there's a couple other little gotchas, but not, not massive ones.\n\nYeah, I've only come across them a couple of times. One of them was like, I had some library that was trying to do a DNS lookup, but they don't have that primitive for creating those socket connections. So yeah, it's, I've only ran into it a couple of times. Usually won't really hit that.\n\nMhm. It like, it really depends on like, like what kind of stuff you're doing, right? Like the, the socket one is the probably the biggest one is, is websockets, and they have their own sort of implementation of that. Workers are limited to three megs on the free platform, um, so three megs of JavaScript, which is is quite a bit, and then 10 megs on the Pro Plan, which also is quite a bit. So I'm thinking of, I'm working on my website right now, which is a Next.js website, and I'm trying to get that thing running on Cloudflare workers, and that thing is, um, something like 900 pages, something like uh, 7,000 import export statements, pretty large website, I would say, and it's just squeaking under, I think it's about eight megs, um, and that, that eight megs is also gzipped, um, as well. It actually turns out to be about 65 megs, not gep. So you can fit a lot of code in workers, and it also doesn't include assets, meaning that if you need an image during your worker, um, if you have any htl, any other like static asset that is needed, that's not part of your JavaScript bundle, that's just 10 megs of actual JavaScript running. Um, and then you can also run multiple workers, which is, is not the easiest thing in the world, but you can just split your code up into to multiple uh, sort of run times.\n\nYeah, and that might be the architecture that some people choose, like essentially it's like microservices, like you have multiple little worker functions that if you're hitting that, that size limit, just break them down. Each one can do their own thing.\n\nYeah, um, I guess on the point of like assets and you and earlier we talked about the not being able to access the file system, there are other things and offerings that Cloudflare gives you that kind of sort of gives you that functionality, which we'll talk about in a second.\n\nYeah, it's, it's kind of funny, like with everything Cloudflare, it's they don't provide X, Y, and Z, but they have their own version of it, um, which at some point is great, but also I don't like coding my apps in, in just a Cloudflare way. Whenever I'm writing a line of code, I want to know that I'd be able to to duck out of this thing and and be able to host it anywhere.\n\nYeah, and it's tricky. I think it's probably the, the one downside of all this is vendor lock-in, which you potentially get with with these other things. And so like, we'll say that up front, it's like once you choose Cloudflare, you're kind of choosing Cloud Player.\n\nYeah, I don't know if that that's true or not. Like I, I'm thinking about all the stuff that I have, okay, and I don't know that I've ever written, well, maybe the durable objects, although there is an open- source project right now, um, I'll try to find the name of it that is is making sort of an an open version of that. So anything I write, I make sure that I'm not too, too locked in. Even the database and whatnot, I'll use Drizzle, um, with just a sqlite adapter.\n\nUh, one kind of interesting thing about workers is you pay for what's called CPU time and not wall time, meaning that and when your worker starts up and when a when a serverless function starts up, you pay based on the number of seconds that that thing is running, right? And if you have like a fetch request that's going off to Open AI and waiting for two seconds to to get a response and then coming back, you're paying for those two seconds, right? And Versel actually last week rolled out something similar to this as well, where you can sort of use that downtime to handle multiple requests, because like that's, that's an expensive time to to pay for. So with C workers, you're only paying for compute, meaning that like when you're waiting on the network, when you're waiting for a fetch request, when you're waiting for those types of things, it's not counted towards your actual bill. They'll give you 10, it doesn't sound like a lot, 10 milliseconds of CPU time, um, and then 30 milliseconds on the on a paid version. So 10 on a free, which doesn't sound like a lot, but I, I'm on the paid version, so I have like 30, 40 something like that, and I've not hit it except for once, um, and I, I had explained that there was actually a bug in a library I was using that was causing too much processing.\n\nYeah, and they do have queues, so you potentially, if you have the long running process, you could push that off to a like a H consumer if you needed to.\n\nOh yeah, yeah, you don't have to sit there and wait for it. Yeah, so there are solutions if you're hitting those, those, those uh, those limits, exactly.\n\nSo Cloud also has Cloud Pages, uh, which is sort of like a sibling to Cloudflare workers, and it was their like platform as a service offering, which like you could like have a get commit and it would build and and and deploy HTML. Most of those features, if not all, are now in Cloudflare workers. And from the read I get from just looking at the docs and whatever, and from the uh, Next.js development, cuz they had this thing called Next on Pages, which I've used, and now they're putting all their effort into open Next.js, which is Next.js on workers. So the read I get from it is they're put trying to put all the pages features into workers, and then I eventually they probably just get rid of Pages entirely, because I'm assuming that's what it is. I don't, I don't know, I don't have any inside hook, but that's kind of the vibe I get for it. So uh, we'll link up a compatibility Matrix, the difference between the two of them, but pretty much you can do everything in a worker.\n\nThat was my insight too, cuz because I only started using Cloud Player last year, um, I think before that, Pages, like you were saying, is the thing they were pushing the most and people were using the most.\n\nYeah, but last year I was really just using workers and I, I went through this Matrix and I was like, yeah, I'm just going to stick with workers. Like I don't see anything too crazy that I can't just do with workers. So yeah, I think and early on the idea was that if you have server code and frontend code, that's what pages was for, um, but now that workers has assets, you can serve them all up and uh, you can do routing and and all kinds of stuff.\n\nUh, let's talk about durable objects. Uh, we've mentioned them briefly on the show before, but I have since had a bit more of a chance to play with them, um, and they're kind of interesting because so the problem with serverless compute in general is that they are short-lived, meaning that somebody visits a UR URL, what will happen is if somebody hasn't visited that URL or that route in a long time, that that will spin up, meaning that it will start, right? That's, that's often referred to as a cold start in the biz, and and then that server will run for however long it needs, and often they'll stay warm for 5, 10 minutes or so, but once they're done, or if you're getting a ton of traffic, multiple versions of that worker serverless function will spin up. And the problems that you have in in that land versus a traditional server land is that they're not always running, meaning you can't expect them to always be, um, running and looking for cron jobs and handling incoming requests. Um, and then they also, they don't share memory. So if you're storing something in memory, you can't expect that all the other processes are also going to be able to to share that memory, right? So that downside, um, even like database connections as well, has, has a sometimes has an issue with that, and and that could be a a bit of an issue if you're trying to do stuff with like real time websockets API, if you're trying to hold state between requests. So Kler has this relatively new product called durable objects, which will, it's kind of cool. Essentially is just an object that will persist between requests, and you can stick stuff on that object, and the next time you come back, you'll know that that object will have that data. And then there's a websocket API for it, meaning that you can, you can stick stuff on that object, and then anyone else that's listening will also get that uh, websocket connection, which is is wild.\n\nSo I've been using this Library called Party Kit to, I eventually want to take one of these, which is a 16x16 LED Matrix, and I was building an app where a user could draw on the website, and then it would also show up on everybody else who has it currently open. And I, I just put my local server up on Twitter and I had like hundreds of people visiting it. It was wild. It was working just great, but then I also want to like, like mirror it to the LEDs as people are drawing on it, and it was amazing that it worked so well, and I was able to get it up and running in in relatively small amount of code, um, and all that was happening was there was no database. It's, it's just like sticking, updating a property on an object in JavaScript, and then when that object is updated, it both stays there forever and will mirror itself to other everybody else who has that websocket currently open.\n\nThat's super cool. So I haven't played with durable objects yet, but that's I, I've read about them and that's how I think about it. Like if you, if you're familiar with OOP, think about creating a class instance, but now that class instance lives in the cloud and any serverless function can put stuff on properties or access properties, but it just lives forever, uh, which is, which is pretty, it's, it's an interesting paradigm for how to deal with persistent data and how to share that data across workers, because it's just, it's just an object.\n\nYeah, it's, it's actually kind of wild that you just think about like, CU often one of my favorite like caching techniques or one of my favorite real time techniques is simply just putting data in memory.\n\n\nThen grabbing it out of memory when you need it.\nUm, and that's essentially what this API is, and like PartyKit is built on this.\nI think TL draw is also built on this.\nI'll have a tweet for some simple example code because there's server code, um, and then there's also client code for connecting to it.\nSo if you do want to do websockets, this is probably the approach to it, and then you're a little bit locked in at this point, although there is, I can't find it right now, but there is an open-source sort of alternative that people are working on, which I like because then you'd be able to still deploy it to Cloudflare, but you could also, assuming you could deploy other places if you want to.\nYeah, and so they've also come out with Cloudflare Workflows.\nUm, I think they put it into open beta back in October.\nI haven't used it yet, but it essentially allows you to build multi-step applications, build workflows.\nUm, and this is one of the ways you can kind of get around the issue of like your Workers hitting CPU time because each one of these steps can run for however long, and then each step will pass data on to the next step, and you can specify like how many times each step should retry.\nUm, you can have state that's shared between the steps.\nSo, for instance, one thing that you could build is, let's say you want to transcribe the audio from a Syntax podcast episode, you could build a multi-step thing that the first step is download the MP3, and that could fail because of whatever reason, maybe it's too big, but if that succeeds, the next step is maybe call an API that can transcribe it, or you pull in some library that can transcribe it, and so that's going to run for a while, and then maybe the next step is you pass that on to a piece that will maybe summarize it with AI, and so that'll make a call off to AI, summarize it, and then the last step is like store it in a database.\nAnd so typically, like, you could write this in a single JavaScript function, but if any one of those things fails, you have to add all kinds of error handling, and you have to be running it in a place that can run for that long.\nUh, so Cloudflare Workflows is nice because you can basically break it down into these distinct steps, and it has built-in retries, and it's a pretty great way to build out those kinds of features.\nIt's wild because, like, if I think about that process that you've just explained, like, you'd have to, like, stick it in a database or put it in a queue.\nUm, and then the queue, you would have to explain how to retry if it fails, yeah, you know, send an email, but if something's down, then try again in 2 minutes, and then try again in 5 minutes.\nAll of that is built into this, so you could simply just write the script in one file, top to bottom.\nThe way that it works is you just simply await step.do, um, and you can sleep it for however long you want.\nSo you could say, uh, send CJ an email, wait for two years, and then after 2 years, like, you're literally awaiting two years, and then you could come back after the next line will run in 2 years from now.\nAll of your memory will be reinstated, all of your variables.\nIt's pretty wild because there was, like, a whole startup dedicated to running code like this, where you could simply just, like, sleep a function, and then you could start it up in a little while, and this is wild to me that it's so easy, uh, for this type of thing.\nEven, like, something, if you have rate limits, you know, you could, I need to loop over this list of 10 files, and I need to search for each one, but I can only do one per minute, you know, you could just do a for loop, and inside the for loop, you could wait one minute, and then in that case, you're not waiting if it takes 5 seconds to do each one, you're only doing 25 seconds instead of 10 minutes of tied up CPU time.\nYeah, I'm super excited to play with this.\nLike, honestly, that flow that I just described, I kind of want to try and implement because we have something in the Syntax code base that's kind of, it's just like a single function, right, that has a few awaits.\nIt's a single function, and it's all squeezed into a single request, and there's a possibility, it doesn't happen very often, but there's a possibility that something could time out.\nUm, I think we're on Vercel.\nI think we get three minutes of time with Vercel, which means we can download, send it off for transcribing, have it come back, send that off to Anthropic, and come back with the data, and then save it to the database, and that's all squeezed inside of a single Cron job.\nUm, but that's, you probably shouldn't be sticking three-minute-long stuff inside of a request.\nIt should probably be in a queue, but I don't feel like introducing a whole queue for that type of thing, so it's a, you should switch it over.\nWell, I'll try, I'll give it a try.\nAll right.\nYeah, I wanted to bring up Cloudflare Queues, uh, and so this is a product that has been around, and the one that I have tried recently, and essentially gives you a similar functionality, but it's kind of just built into Workers.\nIt's just called Cloudflare Queues.\nYou could compare it to something like Redis with BullMQ or Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.\nEssentially, for a queue, you have producers and consumers.\nSo the way that I implemented this was when I was working with the GitHub star data, so for each repo that I wanted to get data for, I needed to download all of the stargazers, and it was hundreds of requests because I'm only getting 100 stars at a time.\nIf you consider a library like Shadcn/UI, it got 38,000 stars, uh, on GitHub last year, so I needed to request 38,000 bits of star data, and so it takes a long time to, like, to request page after page after page after page.\nUm, and so I actually handled this inside of a queue.\nSo when you hit a Hono endpoint that says, I would like this star data, it checks to see, like, is there a job, and I'm storing job information in Key Value, and if there's not a job, it will send a message to the queue that says, hey, we need this star data.\nAnd so that's the producer.\nThe producer is saying, I would like this data, please.\nAnd then the consumer is just waiting there to see, uh, when these messages come in.\nAnd so I have a consumer that when it sees a message to get star data, it then fires off that long-running task.\nAnd so this is another piece of Cloudflare that actually can run for a long time is the consumer of the queue doesn't, won't time out.\nIt'll basically just keep running and running until it's finished.\nAnd so that one consumer is what I have that makes all those requests to the API, and what the way that I implemented this is it's gradually storing that data inside of Key Value, and so if you hit an endpoint with Hono, it's just going to give you the intermediary data, and it's like, hey, I'm still processing, but here's the data so far.\nAnd then finally, when that consumer is done getting all of the data, it updates the job status, and now if you hit that endpoint, you're just getting the latest data, but it's a great way to break up tasks when you have long-running things like that.\nYeah, totally.\nAnd or even things when things could possibly fail.\nI've told the story where, what do I use, Postmark?\nRemember Postmark went down for, like, 12 hours or something the other a couple months ago, and when somebody buys a course from me, I send them an email with their access, right?\nAnd what was, I don't have that in a queue, so if that fails, then they don't get the email, right?\nAnd it's actually never been a problem for eight years until they went down for, or whatever, and I had to quickly jump on and write some code that resent those emails, but ideally, what would happen is, is you would not just send that as part of the setup script, you would, you would just put that in the queue as part of the setup script, and then the queue would, uh, would process them.\nAnd that's why sometimes, you know, when you, like, you sign in, and it's like, we emailed you a code, and sometimes that code comes instantly, and sometimes you have to wait, like, two minutes for that thing to show up.\nOften, that's because they just add, send Wes a code to their queue, and then their email goes through and processes the queue as fast as they can, but they may be backed up a little bit.\nDefinitely.\nAnd so what I'm thinking about right now is, like, this is kind of how Cloudflare gives you the, like, scalability, even without really having to know about all this, like, complex architecture and stuff, because this idea of, like, queues and splitting up work, this is what you do if you want to scale an app, uh, but it's super simple.\nYou literally add the queues product, yeah, the queues to your app, and now you have a producer and a consumer.\nUm, so it's interesting how they've kind of taken something that used to be super complex, and now, like, it's pretty easy to just implement in your in your Worker.\nThat's why I'm so, like, bullish on the Cloudflare stack.\nUm, like, I've got lots of qualms about it, but I'm like, long term, I'm, I'm very excited about it because they are both, like, a Netlify, Vercel, Fly, whatever, like a platform as a service, we'll call it, but they're also the, the, like, AWS, like, the, the low-level infrastructure provider.\nSo you kind of get the best of both worlds.\nIt's certainly not at a Vercel level or Netlify level at all yet, but I do think it's going to get there, especially when they keep rolling out the silly easy things, like sleeping something for a couple hours, and it comes back, or Durable Objects.\nSo I'm big on it, definitely.\nAll right, let's talk about files.\nSo Cloudflare has, or is a CDN, meaning that if you serve a file up with Cloudflare, their cache will cache that file and distribute it around the world to all their different data centers, right?\nAnd you can opt into it by default.\nYou can control the knobs with a Worker itself, um, which is kind of cool.\nThat's one use case for a Worker is it's not necessarily just the end result.\nYou can also put a Worker in front of something where it will intercept the request and and either pass it along or send something back or tweak a couple knobs and and keep their requests going.\nBut along with their CDN cache, um, that usually sits on top of their other asset provider, so R2 is their Amazon S3 alternative.\nThat's their storage, right?\nSo if you want to host a bunch of images, you want to host a bunch of video parts, some MP3s, PDFs, literally anything you want to host, anything, that's where you would stick your data into Cloudflare R2.\nAnd like all R2 alternatives, um, we had a whole show on this.\nBackblaze is another one.\nBunny is a big one.\nThey are all S3 compatible, meaning that the S3 API, you can just grab the Amazon S3 node package, and you can upload files, um, directly to Cloudflare.\nYeah, so this is the one piece that, like, isn't vendor lock-in, cuz they're using that exact same API.\nLike, you could store your stuff there, but if you want to switch, you could switch to any other one.\nAnd one cool thing about Cloudflare and many other companies is they have this thing called The Open Bandwidth Alliance.\nLet me find out who else is in this.\nYeah, I think I know what you're talking about because I've looked at Backblaze before, and they, they talk about free egress, where, like, if you're, if you're transferring data between these specific companies, it's completely free or, like, super low cost.\nYeah, so we talked about this on episode 780.\nGo to syntax.fm for 780, and we talk about all the different approaches, um, and trying to figure out which one is cheapest, because some of them will charge you based on bandwidth and less to hold files.\nSo if you have, like, a lot of people downloading a very small amount of files, that that will be different than if you have tons of files which are very infrequently downloaded, something like a Dropbox, you know, you might have a file in there for 10 years, and it won't never, never get asked.\nBut Cloudflare has this thing called The Open Bandwidth Alliance, or they're part of The Open Bandwidth Alliance, which means that any data egress between these vendors will not be charged, and that's huge, because if you ever wanted to move all of your data out of something like a Google Cloud into Cloudflare, or out of Cloudflare into Backblaze, like, there's people that are locked into Amazon S3 for life because it would cost them millions of dollars simply just to move them out of S3.\nUh, so that Open Bandwidth Alliance is pretty exciting.\nDefinitely.\nOn top of R2, Cloudflare also has, like, an image pipeline, which I'm using right now.\nThis both has an API, so you can upload an image, and you can ask for it in different resolutions, different formats, different, you can crop them, you can resize them, or you can also just, like, use the, like, the URL scoping, meaning that, like, you, you set up a special URL on your domain name, and then any requests that come in via that URL, are you sort of proxy your images through, and then it will resize and and crop and and whatnot.\nSo there's, like, a Next.js image component that you can use, which will just sort of resize them on the fly as they're requested.\nSo that's really nice because you simply just need to serve up the high-res version of whatever it is that you want, and you know that your app will always deliver the resized, converted, compressed version for your app.\nI, this is the one thing I've looked into, but haven't used yet.\nLike, I saw that images has a storage option, but you could also, like, point it at R2.\nWhen I was looking into it, it seemed like R2 would be the cheaper path because it's, like, cheaper to store images there, and then, like, use their convert.\nWhich path are you going down?\nI did both.\nSo I once built an app that had, like, an upload button, um, like, you want to, like, create a product and upload photos that are associated with that.\nSo in that case, I used their image product, um, and that just simply uploaded it to the images, and yeah, you're right, like, the prices for that are a little bit more expensive, and that's you get the convenience of them being part of that product, or you can just simply resize them and stick them in R2.\nI'm pretty sure the Next.js image component just uses the URL pipeline because I don't see those images, I don't see those images in my, like, when I log into Cloudflare and click on images, they're not in there, um, because that's, that's just things that I've explicitly uploaded to Cloudflare Images.\nOkay, but again, it's relatively inexpensive, and a big, I've been, I'm also using Cloudinary quite a bit for mine, but that the Cloudinary jump from free to paid is, like, zero to, I think it's, like, 200 bucks or something like that, which I think is is worth it for a lot of people, but if you're on a, on, like, a little hobby project, and and you need to make that jump, like, it's getting a little less hobby.\nIs that, that can get to be a little expensive.\nYeah, it's free for 5,000 transformations and $5 per 100,000 images stored, so pretty, pretty generous free tier.\nOne of the most hilarious things about all these pricings is, like, like, you've heard of girl math and boy math, like, there's, like, sis in math as well, trying to figure\n\n\nFiguring out how much something is going to cost is hilarious and a bit tricky to figure out.\n\nI will say, like, I've been on the free tier for long.\nI didn't switch to the paid tier until like a few months ago, and really, for all the things I was trying to use, like Workers and Key Value, I didn't hit any limits.\nUm, but there are a few products you have to be on the paid tier to try.\nI think maybe it was Cloudflare Queues or something like that.\nDefinitely Durable Objects is paid tier only.\nThat's why I think that's why I upgraded.\nBut yeah, like my bill, I have several things running on Cloudflare, and my bill is always, always tiny.\nI've never heard somebody be shocked with a bill.\nI think Cloudflare makes most of their money on Enterprise, and the sort of lower level stuff, the free plan, the Pro Plan that we're on, or business plan, is relatively cheap.\nAnd I think once you get up into the Enterprise level, they start getting into, they have their whole, like, octo replacer, where, like, you can have access to your products, like, you could put a whole firewall in front of all of your products, and you can do single sign-on with that.\nYou know, there's so much in the Enterprise world that I think will make them a lot of money when you multiply it by, like, a something like a Salesforce or whatever that has 20,000 employees that need to have access.\nYou know, five bucks a month per employee, definitely.\nSo I'm happy for that, at least for now.\nUm, I, Cloudflare has been dirt cheap for many, many years, and I don't feel like they would ever do a rug pull.\nBut I've, uh, I've been rug pulled before, and they're a public company already.\nIt's not like they're a, like, a VC company that is just burning VC money, and then once it comes time to actually make the money, they triple the price.\nSo, uh, I'm not too concerned there.\n\nThe Cloudflare Stream, um, this is for video.\nWe did an episode a couple months ago on how you can do your own streaming simply by using Cloudflare R2, and because bandwidth is free, it literally costs pennies to host your own video.\nBut then you have to do your whole data ingestion pipeline.\nUm, so you have to chop up your videos with FFMpeg, you got to upload all the bits, you got to do all that.\nCloudflare Stream is simply just upload a video out the other end, they'll give it to you.\nThey do not do 4K, and they haven't for like five years.\nUm, so that's a probably a deal killer for, I would say, most people.\nI don't know why they don't have 4K support.\nYeah, this is another product I haven't tried yet, but I've looked into, like, host, because I do live streaming on Twitch and YouTube.\nFor a while, I was like, should I try to stream myself on my site, maybe for like members only or something like that?\nSo that's, that's definitely one of the products I was looking into.\n\nUh, all right, Data.\nSo we talked about assets and files and whatnot.\nUm, they also have several, like, database products.\nSo D1 is their SQL light relational database.\nSo if you're trying to build a product that you would typically reach for MySQL or PostGres or SQL light or something like that, D1 is what you want.\nIt follows the SQL light spec mostly, and you can use things like, like a Drizzle, uh, is what I've been using to interface with it.\nI have three or four different projects running on D1, and I'm a big fan of it, definitely.\nAnd I think the magic there is, like, uh, these Workers all get their own little local instance of a SQLite database.\nSo the reads are super fast.\nThe rights have to be replicated across, but that's one of the bits of magic there is, like, your reads from this database are super fast.\nYeah, they use the word \"eventually consistent,\" meaning that you write to a database, it is not guaranteed immediately after writing to a database in Canada that reading it in Tokyo will have that result, right?\nIt has to propagate out.\nI have never had that problem in my life where things need to be so instant.\nUh, certainly there are lots of applications that would need that, but it is relatively fast in my experience, and we're talking like milliseconds here, not like minutes to propagate around the world.\nD1 is really interesting because you can roll back a database to any second in the last 30 days, um, which is really cool.\nThat you could just, like, if you, oh, I need to roll back my database, and like, with our existing database, with the Syntax database, if you simply want to make a copy of that thing or you want to roll it back, like, it takes, like, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes, uh, to get a new version of it running.\nSo this is kind of neat, definitely.\n\nKey Value.\nThis Key Value is awesome.\nSo if you ever have the problem where, like, I need to store something in memory, or I just need to put this somewhere and then be able to get it later, Key Value is what you want.\nIt's kind of like the local storage API for the browser, or sorry, for servers.\nUh, and Key Value in general is pretty nifty.\nYou can basically, you, there's just set and get.\nUh, you can set some data into it, and then you can get the data, and alternatively, you can also get the data and telling it what the type is.\nSo I believe there is just a string, binary, or JSON.\nUm, so you can pull the, pull the JSON data out of the Key Value, which, which could be pretty handy.\nYou can also set expires on it.\nIf you used Redis in the past, that's a kind of a handy value because I will often use Key Value as a kind of cheap cache, meaning that I'll stick something in Key Value, and then when I need to get something, I'll first check if it's in Key Value.\nIf it's not, it probably expired, and then I'll just go through the rest of the function that goes to recreate it.\nYeah, this is comparable to something like Redis.\nI've used it for similar things, and I actually combined Key Value with Cloudflare Queues when I was building out that GitHub Stars API, because that's where I was storing all of the intermediate data of that background task.\nSo, like, it'd be getting data, storing it in Key Value, and super easy to use.\nI, I, I, I didn't come across the typed API, like, I think I was manually stringifying, because that's one of the things about Key Values, your values have to be stored as strings.\nYeah, but it sounds like they have a helper that will, like, JSON parse it for you.\nOh, yeah, I just pulled it up.\nUh, you can set the type to be text, JSON, array buffer, or stream.\nSo yeah, it could be any of those types, which is pretty nifty.\nAwesome.\nAnd then you can set the, the TTL on that.\nUh, I've used Key Value as simply just a way to store hit counter values.\nUm, if you go to fv.far, which is this little website I made for generating favicons, um, so basically turning emojis into favicons for a quick favicon, and it's gotten extremely popular, um, because people just use it whenever you're making a quick little demo HTML, uh, you want to stick a favicon in there without finding one.\nAnd I started, this is running on D1 and is using D1's Key Value, um, and I started counting how often each emoji is requested, and then I put the outputted values on the homepage.\nAnd about halfway through the month, I get an email from Dino being like, \"You're exhausted the free tier of Key Value read and writes.\"\nUm, or just rights.\nThere's, there's, like, a limit of 100,000 rights or something like that per month.\nSo I, I exhaust it.\nSo the numbers aren't perfect, but, uh, once I put that up there, people started gaming it by writing little bots to hit the favicons and and jack the numbers up, and it's, it's really, I had to eventually take the country emojis and put them in their own spot, because everybody was gaming the country emojis, trying to make them number one.\nYeah, what's that one at the, that Netherlands or it, what, what is that flag there?\nThere's a number one flag, right?\nFrance.\nOh, France, okay.\nFrance.\nFrance was getting, yeah, it's, I think that was pretty funny.\nIt's, but it just goes to show, like, that's a cheap way to build a hit counter, and if you want an example to build in Cloudflare Workers, a hit counter is a very easy one to do.\nDefinitely.\nI'll just mention really quick, the TTL is also really great when you're, maybe you're scraping data, or maybe you're pulling data from an API, and you want to do it on a regular basis, making an API request, storing it in Key Value with a time delay of, let's say, like, 24 hours, and then every other request that comes into your Worker just pulls from Key Value, but then after 24 hours, it's expired, and now you go off and pull that data from the API again.\nSo that's another thing that I've used this pretty often for is just expire the data so I can always refresh it.\nThat's exactly what I'm using it for on my updated website, because I'm pinging Twitter, LinkedIn, Blue Sky, all the social platforms, and I'm pulling in stats for each of my, like, posts, and you can only hit those APIs, especially because I'm, I'm like scraping them, you can only do it so often before they block you.\nSo I have, like, a TTL of 45 minutes or something on each one of them, so that they at most only hit each API every 45 minutes.\n\nHyperdrive.\nThis one's actually kind of cool.\nYou want to explain that?\nYeah, so, um, I haven't used it yet, but I started looking into it because pretty often when you start working with Workers, everything you see is, like, just use D1.\nWell, what if you don't want to use SQLite?\nThey introduced Hyperdrive, and it essentially allows you to take any PostGres database hosted anywhere and turn it into a globally distributed PostGres database.\nThis was fascinating to me because if you're the kind of person that maybe, like, you're self-hosting some things, maybe you have Coolify, and you're running a PostGres database, that thing, it probably isn't going to scale very well once you get thousands and thousands of users, but if you put it behind Hyperdrive, Hyperdrive will essentially, like, cache any reads going into the DB and then also make it super fast for reads across the world.\nUm, so it's, it's, I don't know if it's built on top of PG bouncer, but it's very similar in that it creates a bunch of connection pools so that the database connection can be reused.\nAnd you talked about this a little bit earlier, but this is one of those things you need when you're dealing with, uh, Edge functions or serverless, or in this case, Workers, because so many of them spin up, you could potentially, like, saturate the number of available connections to your database.\nSo typically, if you're trying to connect to something like PostGres from a Worker, you'd want to put it behind Hyperdrive, so that way, first of all, it can scale it globally, but beyond that, it makes sure to manage all those connections of all the Workers spinning up.\nI, I actually had this problem with my receipt printer, um, that I was working on a while ago, because the receipt printer allows a TCP connection, but it only allows one, and once that one is saturated, I thought this was kind of an apt expression of how databases work, right?\nOnce something is connected to it, you can't have more connections to it.\nDatabases can sometimes, like, five or six connections at once before it says, \"Hey, no more connections to me.\"\nBut then you need to, you need, like, something that will pull them, right, and sit in front of it, and that's what Hyperdrive does.\nUm, I, I'm curious if you could also use a Durable Object for that as well and have the Durable Object be the, but there's no, there's no TCP in the Cloudflare Workers, I don't think.\nSo I'm just curious if you would hit, like, St limits in Durable Objects.\nYou'd probably have to do some jumping around to make sure.\nYeah, well, I'm, I'm not saying, yeah, I'm not saying use the Durable Object to store the data, but I'm saying, like, use the Durable Object as the connection pool, um, and then take all the requests coming in and pass them along as you have them coming in.\nSo, like, I even had that with my little ESP32 here, where I built a WebSocket server on it, and the WebSocket server can be connected to a million times, and then the server itself sort of collects them all and passes it along as a serial data.\n\nAll right, next one we have here is Vector databases and vectorizing data.\nSo in the AI world, when you have something like a, like, let's say, the title of our podcast, what you can do is you can convert your the titles of the podcast to something called an embedding, and an embedding is a, like, a mathematical representation of that data.\nAnd then once something is in an embedding, you can store it in a vector database, and that allows you to query based on, like, similarity.\nThere's different algorithms that you can use.\nCosine similarity is probably the big one, and that's often how these, like, similar episode things are actually work, because you can, you can vectorize the title, you can vectorize pieces of the transcript, you can vectorize photos.\nThat's how, like, similar photos will often work.\nUm, basically, you, you take a photo and you vector it, and then, or you, you turn it into an embedding, and then you say, \"Show me embeddings that are mathematically close to this,\" and then it will, it'll bring you back photos that are similar or podcast episodes that are similar.\nAnd in order to do those calculations, like, cosine similarity being one of them, um, you either need to download all the data and run it in memory, but once that gets too large, you need a database that can run vector queries.\nAnd, uh, Cloudflare has a vectorized database as well as, um, APIs for creating the embeddings, which is pretty nifty, definitely.\nAnd this goes right in with their AI offering, because they have a way to, like, call AI APIs, but pretty often, um, you would use a vector database to kind of, like, store additional context for your queries to an AI.\nAnd, like, Wes was mentioning the fact that you can search through the database and find the most relevant things, that's how you're able to create context that doesn't fill up your context window for when you're calling the API, but it's just enough to have the relevant pieces so that the AI doesn't hallucinate as much and it has a little bit more, uh, things that it can reference when it's doing that query.\nThat, that's often called RAG, or it's called Retrieval Augmented Generation.\nUm, we actually built a little demo with all the Syntax transcripts once, where we could convert all the Syntax transcripts into embeddings, and then we asked it a question, like, \"What does Wes think about React?\"\nAnd then what it would do is it would take that question, vectorize it, and then it would compare that sentence to the rest of the podcast episodes, or it wasn't just the entire podcast episode, it was, like, it found, like, a little snippet of where we talked about it, and then it grabbed, like, a couple sentences before and a couple sentences after, and then we fed that to the prompt and say, \"Given this context, now answer this question,\" right?\nAnd yeah, like you said, it doesn't hallucinate as much in that case.\nYeah, they have all kinds of stuff in the AI world.\nIt's very similar to most, like, Cloud offerings right now.\nThey are sort of trying to be the place where people go to get it.\nSo you can run all the different models on Cloudflare, um, which is pretty cool, because you can simply just input support the AI model, like, the name of it.\nYou don't have to download this 80 gig\n\n\nA byte model and then you just run a query against it, and you get the data back. So it's a very quick way to get access to all these different AI models, and they're pretty good at introducing new ones. Once the big ones hit, they'll try to roll them out and get them into production as fast as possible.\n\nDefinitely, and one of the features I like is the Automated Rate-Limiting. So if you're, let's say, you're integrating with the OpenAI API, and all of a sudden you get an influx of traffic on your website, it's potential your OpenAI bill is going to go up and up and up because you're getting all those queries to their API. But they have an offering, and because they already do all of this DNS and preventing bots and stuff like that, they have rate limiting. So they give you a URL, you just replace the OpenAI URL with their URL, and now you can configure your rate limiting settings.\n\nYeah, so you don't even have to use their AI stuff. You just, it's basically like a little AI proxy that... Oh, so you can still hit your own... That's, I didn't realize they had that.\n\nYeah, that isn't it funny how the OpenAI API has sort of become like the standard for... It's similar to how what the S3 API is is standard for all um image uploads or not just what's it called, file uploads, file storage, object storage. Yeah, file uploads, there we go.\n\nUh, oh man, we're we're running up on an hour here. Uh, let's go through Frameworks. How to actually use... I've been using the Open Next.js Cloudflare adapter, still very heavily under development. I probably... they recommend don't use it for production just yet, but uh, it is very close to supporting all the Next.js features that you would expect, which is really cool. And being able to access all of your bindings, meaning that if you want to access D1 or Key Value or R2 or any of these things, they make it really easy because one of the things about all of the Cloudflare offerings is you often have to access them through a worker. And if your code is not running inside of a worker, it's hard to get access to them. It's not like a regular database where you just get a connection string and you can connect to it. So they've done a great job there.\n\nUh, Orange JS is another one that's built on React Router 7, and they're attempting to make a full stack framework, which is kind of cool. Like, is this going to be the Laravel for Cloudflare? Nice. I can imagine something like that popping up. Basically, I mean, all of these offerings are already pretty easy to use, but to just put them into a single framework and maybe you have like a consistent API, like, yeah, this this could be the Laravel of the JS world. Yes.\n\nAnd of course, Hono, which is... I mean, you've probably heard me talk about it on the podcast here before, and that's mainly what I've used it for is uh building backend APIs. And like we mentioned at the beginning of the episode, essentially, you can define all of your routes, you can have middlewares, all the stuff you're used to when building back in API, but they can live inside of that Cloudflare worker.\n\nUm, I will say the other thing that I've done is I've combined that with a single page application built with React. And because of their uh static assets offering, that single page app can live as static files right next to the worker. And then you might have set up a site like this before, but essentially, if a request comes into the root, it redirects back to that index.html, but then everything that's /API is served up via the worker. So if you like... So it's like a a single deploy still though, right? Front end, backend.\n\nExactly, but yeah, but that's it's not server rendered, it's API and front end, which is how I like to build most things, but it does live in the same deployment. It's a single deployment.\n\nYeah, and Hono has like RPC, right? So you could import the Hono RPC and and call server functions from the client.\n\nExactly. So I did a video on monorepos, and this is one of those monorepos that I showed where you have the React app and the Hono app living in the same monorepo that share those RPC types. So all the endpoints you define with Hono are fully typed, and then when you use that client um in your React app, it knows exactly what the types are going to be versus for various responses, um and also like what the errors are shaped like. So yeah, it gives you full type safety uh for that.\n\nBeautiful. And then like other things, most other stuff will have like an adapter for Cloudflare deploying. You know, we had we talked about N last week, React Rer 7, there will just be adapters that you can export to it. It it's pretty much most new modern stuff with the exception of Next.js will have an an adapter, and it's built in a way that yeah, you can deploy this thing anywhere in Cloudflare being one of them.\n\nLast thing I want to talk about real quick is they have like a they have Analytics Engine, which uh Ben Vinegar, uh he we had him on the podcast to talk about this. He's building this thing called Counter Scale, which is basically you can host your own analytics on your own Cloudflare, which is is wild. And then he just built this... you get this whole dashboard, yeah, similar to like Plausible, where you can kind of see who's visiting your website, how many hits you got, what pages, what are the referrers, um but self-hosted, and it's dirt cheap to run on uh on the Analytics Engine. So it's it's pretty nifty.\n\nThey also have uh a WebRTC engine, which if want to do like you want to build anything has real-time calling, they've got that primitive, and then they have a Puppeteer API, which is something I've been using because I do uh screenshots to generate the open graph images.\n\nSo anything else to add about Fullstack Cloudflare? I, we didn't even touch, we maybe touched like 26% of the products, but those are the the big ones for me.\n\nYeah, I guess I'll just mention, I'm sure there's going to be somebody in the YouTube comments, oh, this is Cloudflare Shields sponsored. It's not sponsored, like we like the product, we use it, and it just has a bunch of cool stuff. Like I, I would highly recommend, like if you're building like the stock...\n\nExactly. I actually don't own any of their stock.\n\nNo, no, me neither.\n\nYeah, yeah, everyone always says that type of thing. Um, but honestly, I'm I'm I'm critical of them in many ways, but they are very receptive to feedback as well as like, I think once the stuff sort of gets smoothed out, they been working, they've been putting out products like crazy. I I do think that this is going to be a very big option in the future for when you're you're building apps.\n\nDefinitely, completely agree.\n\nCool. All right, let's uh wrap it up with some Sick Picks and Shameless Plugs. You got a Sick Pick for me today?\n\nAll right, I have one. Um, so my MacBook, I think only has like, it's like a 256 uh gig SSD, um, but I do, yeah, I struggle to transfer stuff back and forth because I do a lot of video editing, and like those files are really big. Uh, but I I came across an SD card reader that's smaller than usual, and it sits flush uh on the Mac. So I have a a one terabyte uh micro SD. So this plugs into my MacBook, and then it doesn't stick out, and so I have like basically a terabyte of extra storage all the time. So yeah, I... that's awesome. I'll link to the one that I found. There's probably other examples out there if you just search for like MacBook Pro small micro SD. Yeah, probably find it. And do you edit edit off of that, or is that sort of like you offload?\n\nI offload, but you could like the transfer speeds, I I guess it depends on the micro SD card, but uh the trans the transfer speeds are are decent enough that you could actually edit directly off of it.\n\nOkay, yeah, I often think about that. Like, when I got my MacBook, I I was so sick of running out of space, drives me nuts. You know, you record a couple videos and you're out of space, and so I got the the 2 TB and it was good for like a year or two, but now I'm all I'm running up on it, especially you download a couple of these AI models and and before you know it, it's uh you're you're out of space. It drives me crazy that I had like a two terabyte desktop like 15 years ago, and now I still only have a two terabyte, like give me a 100 terabytes. I don't want to use Apple Drive or whatever the stupid thing is they always try to prompt me for, same with the phones, drives me...\n\nDefinely. Okay, I'll Sick Pick along the same rounds. Uh, I have a Synology with 20 terabytes in it or something crazy like that, and uh, I use that as my like cold storage. So when I'm done a video, I will drag it into my Synology on the network, the whole the thing will transfer over there, and then I have the Synology set up so that it mirrors to Backblaze B2, um, so that I have like a local and a remote copy of that. And that I've been running that for years, and I love that setup because I I don't have to like worry about having access to it when I'm when I when I need it. I can either I can just connect to it remotely or I can go into Backblaze and get it, uh, and it just it feels really good, and Backblaze is is dirt cheap for holding stuff long term uh where you're not accessing it frequently. So big fan of that.\n\nThat's awesome. I I'm Synology curious, like I started building my own R, but I see all the like Synology, like you pay a premium like for their hardware, and but it seems like they have so much built in. I definitely got to give it a try.\n\nIt's I I'm in the opposite way because it only has a 1 gig network card.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd there's there's two 1 gig cards, and I've been trying to like not bridge them, but there's a what is it, SMB, you can multicast SMB, you can you can send stuff over both, and like I have a two and a half gig Nick on my my uh MacBook, I cannot get it working. So I'm like, ah, what I would do for a 10 gig uh NZ, and that's the path I'm down is just custom build.\n\nYeah, be kind of fun to do that, but then also like I'll just wait an extra three minutes for the thing to transfer, and it'll be okay. So that's that's good. But yeah, we should do another show on Synology, me and Scott, because we uh we've been using ours for five, six years now, and we're we're we're both pretty heavily into it. I've been running Kulfy on mine for a long time, but I had to stop it because I was it was eating too much RAM. I only have like 16 gigs on there or something.\n\nAll right, that's it for today. Thank you so much for everybody tuning in. Make sure you check us out on YouTube, youtube.com/syntax.fm. You can check out some of CJ's videos as well, specifically on the Cloudflare stuff, he's got lots of them. Um, thanks for tuning in. Catch you later. Peace.\n",
