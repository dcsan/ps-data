  "cleanText": "Welcome sports fans. Today we are going to be doing the first syntax snake draft, and we are going to be drafting our favorite VS Code plugins. That's right. Each person gets the opportunity to draft a VS Code plugin in order. And we're doing this as a snake draft. So, it goes person 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1 until we each have five VS Code extensions on our roster. And there's also going to be steals. Each person gets one steal where we can steal another person's pick. And once a VS Code extension is picked, it's off the table. No duplicate picks. And at the end of this, y'all are going to get to vote on who has the best team of VS Code extensions. I'm so excited. I can't wait. Uh, I'm raring to go. We're going to start off with a draft order randomizer. So, you can all see that this is a totally above board. I'm going to, I didn't even make this, so it's not going to put me first. Whatever. I'm going to click randomize, and we're going to see what the order is.\nOh, it put me first. Okay. Oh, come on. I think second's a good spot to be cuz I get second every time. So second is a great spot to be. Honestly, I kind of hate first because that means I get the first pick, but then I also get the sixth pick. So Wes, you get to do two picks in a row, meaning that I have to be very, very strategic with my first pick. 30 seconds on the board, folks, for each pick. I'm on the clock.\nI am going to pick for my first pick, GitHub.copilot-chat.\nOkay, I guess we did. Yeah, we did. Isn't that part of the editor now, Scott? Didn't we just have them on?\nYeah, it's built in now. Is it built in? If it's built in, then I not yet. Well, yeah. Does it come by default? That's a good question. I, if you look at, if you look at, I don't think it comes by default. We're not talking cursor here. We're not talking whatever. I like the GitHub.copilot-chat. Give me the GitHub.copilot-chat. Cool. You can have it, CJ. All right. First up, got to get fancy cuz this is a draft. So, I brought my, brought my best blazer. I don't even know if I own a blazer anymore. This was from my friend's wedding like 10 years ago. Okay. It doesn't, it doesn't fit. You got 16 seconds. Okay.\nMy pick, my pick is dbaeumer.vscode-eslint cuz I, I can't function without ESLint. So it's at the top of my list. ESLint.\nHow 1990 of you, CJ. Wes, you're on the board. All right, here we go. So I am going to pick uh, bierner.comment-tagged-templates. So this is an extension that if you are ever writing any language in a string, like some CSS or uh, SQL, and you want it to be highlighted, you want the autocomplete, you want everything, you can just put a little um, comment right before it, like, like for/star CSS or SQL, and it will highlight as if it were that language. Super handy. That's your first overall pick. You guys wrecked on me for GitHub.copilot-chat, and that's your first pick. No, I'm, I'm being uh, smart about what I'm doing here. Not giving away my best ones right away cuz then you're going to steal them. And like you guys don't have great taste in in extensions, so I'm not scared that you're going to pick them first. Okay. I pick useful ones, not random ones. No, it's not random. I use that every single day. That's bizarre. Okay. Wes, you, your next pick is on the board. I'm picking biomejs.biome.\nMan, I've been, I've been starting so many projects lately, and I'm, I'm just so exhausted with my freaking ESLint just not working, and I, I don't know why. And there's a new version of the thing out there, and I have to migrate it, and I, I've just been like, you know what, screw it. Biome. Boom. Throw that in. Slap it in nice and fast. It always just works. So, um, you can have lint there. I'm, yeah. Thank, I appreciate it. Yeah.\nSo, my pick next is called uh, quicktype.quicktype. Um, I use it all the time. Essentially, you can grab some JSON that came back from an API response, open it up in VS Code, paste JSON as code, and it'll turn it into a TypeScript type, but they also support a lot of other languages, too. So, you could turn it into like a C# class or whatever else. Uh, but I use this all the time when I'm talking to APIs or I have some like random JSON that I need to type for. So, yeah, this is, I use it every day. I used to use some random website that would take JSON and and convert it to TypeScript types, but now I just use\nIt's funny how many of these extensions I'm just like, well, I used to use this a lot, but now the AI just does it for me. Oh, yeah. Copilot chat. Come on. It'll be your only pick cuz it does everything else. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Exactly. Okay, cool. I guess I am on the board. This is a tough one, folks. There's so many great extensions on my list. Still on my board. Y'all are picking nothing on my board here. Um, let's go ahead and, this is one you may or may not have heard of. Actually, no, I'm going to go with one I use literally every day instead. I'm going with aaron-bond.better-comments. I love better comments. I use this every day. It allows you to annotate your comments with different symbols and it colors them. You can do an exclamation point and it makes it red or asterisk it and makes it blue. I use this all the darn time and it is my favorite extension. I have never heard of this. It looks great. Oh man. Yeah, it's so good. All right, I guess I'm also on the board again. Snake Drafting. All right, Snake Drafting. I got so many other favorites here in my toolkit. And I'm going to go with another one you may have also not have heard of, but you are going to install it after this episode. Uh, that is pranaygp.vscode-css-peek. I wrote peak, uh, but P E K CSS peak. Basically, it gives you clickth through to CSS. So, you know, like in the VS Code, you have a function, uh, you're using it somewhere, you hold the command key, you click or whatever with F12 or whatever to go to the definition of that function. This is that for CSS. It also gives you peing so that if you hover over it, it shows you that CSS that exists within that class. Essential tool for me. That's great. And I did not know this existed, but I need it in my life. Yes, it has like 7 million downloads. It's, it's cool. Cool.\nUh, my next pick uh, is called adpyke.codesnap. So uh, sometimes I like to share screenshots of code on on x.com or whatever else. And what I like about Codeen Snap is it uses the syntax highlighting inside of your editor. So if you've already figured out your favorite theme or whatever else, Code Snap will take a picture of the highlighted code exactly as you see it in VS Code, but with nice like window chrome and like a nice uh, background. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. and and it doesn't, one problem I have with my screenshots is often there'll be like a like a type error underline and I have to like go figure out how to turn those off. I, I, I went so far as to make a custom profile where the squiggles would be see-through so that they wouldn't be in my screenshot. So I, I should be using that. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't show any syntax highlighting or or like any squiggies or anything like that. It's just, it's just the syntax highlighting. Yeah. I almost never do that. But I, I, I always appreciate them the way they look. They look nice. All right, I am going to steal better comments. Check this out. So better comments with custom things. So obviously you can do to-do, right? But what I've done is I've taken it a bit further and I have a for/t, and it goes white, and I use that a lot for my my coding screenshots where I want it to be different than my like regular comment which is blue. But then I also have when I'm teaching a course, I'll have methods and solutions, and I'll have them highlighted differently, and then I have a couple others for just random random colors. So stealing better comments. Nice. Scott, you got 10 seconds to replace it.\n10 seconds.\nOh, dear God. Um, 10 seconds. Wes just uses a steel. I'm going to say uh, GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github.\nThat's a good one. It allows you to uh, manage your GitHub stuff through VS Code. You can comment on lines right from the the code editor. You can like, like stage a pull request right inside of VS Code. It's, it's super good. Super handy. Uh, yeah, I, I always use the GitHub UI. I should try this out. That was a massive fail on my part getting my things stolen and also have several massive fails in my codebase pretty much all the time. But guess what? I can not only solve them now, but with a new feature in Sentry, I can log them. Sentry's got logging now. And what's cool about like logging in in Sentry compared to something like an other logging generic database full of logs is that uh, you can connect those to your actual Sentry errors. And all of information is like tightly connected in a way that makes, well, it makes it more powerful than just being like, &quot;Here's a console log of an an error or something that went wrong. Let me connect it to everything that's going wrong or which user or which operating system or which version or any of that stuff. This show is presented by Sentry.\nW.\nusernamehw.errorlens. Um, error lens is something that will take your errors, whether they're linting errors or eslin ers or whatever, um, TypeScript errors, and it will put them in line. So what I've done is I've tweaked error lens to be a little less obnoxious, like really nice and small. And then I've also added some custom rules to filter out the common ones like unused variables. I don't need a unused variable in line. So I, I've filtered that out in my settings. So now, now I can just kind of see what my TypeScript or linting errors are as I'm coding. H, that would have been a good Sentry read. Error lens.\nNice. Yes, I love error lens. Also use that. CJ, you're on the board. Yes. My pick is also error related. It's called yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors. So yes, those TypeScript errors are typically really long, not formatted very well. Pretty Typescript errors gives them syntax highlighting um, and kind of boils it down to make it a bit easier to figure out what exactly was going wrong with a TypeScript error. So yeah, pretty typescript errors is mine. Sick. I love that. I uh, I also had that on my list. I'm in a bind here cuz I got to do pick two. Um, I'm going to steal back better comments because um, middle finger emoji, Wes is my my most used. I use this all the darn time. I, I also have custom ones set up. Okay, so you can have it 10 seconds. I'm even going to give you a demo in that that 10 seconds is uh, sleistner.vscode-fileutils. So if you're in a file, you can rename, move, delete a file right from the command pallet instead of having to hunt for it in your sidebar. I love it. File utils. Definitely use that myself.\nUm, okay. My last pick here is going to be esbenp.prettier-vscode. Prettier for formatting my code. Just prettier. I love prettier. I use, it's true. Imagine not having code formatting on save. That, that's awful. So, if you can't use prettier, like your, your, I guess your ESLint can do that partially. I use ESLint with the stylistic rules, so it has all the formatting of prettier, and then I do lint on save behaves the same way. All right. Well, I use biome. I'm glad we're, we're all not fighting over our code formatting cuz that would suck writing code without formatting. CJ, you're on the board. CJ, ah, the timer's going. Okay, I have one I like called Gruntfuggly.todo-tree. Yes, to-do tree is on my list. Yeah, so a large code base. If you just put to-do in your comments, to-do tree wraps them all up into a nice tree view. So you can see like what files these to-dos are inside of, and it has like nice highlighting of them. So yeah, sick. I'm picking one called earshinov.permute-lines. Um, I use VS Code as like a place to dump data, whether I have like a list of email addresses or uh, a list of IDs that need to be worked with, and if you need to remove duplicates, you need to shuffle them, you need to reverse them. These are three functions that I missed from Sublime Text. And this is a permit lines um, built-in function. If you ever, ever have to like open up Excel just to do something with your data or like build a little JavaScript function, this is what you need. Nice. Man, what a draft.\nCJ, you didn't use a steal, any strategy there. Just nothing that you liked. No, you guys didn't take the stuff I like. So, I think I, I think I probably should have stole Pac's JSON, just finding out about that now. That's that seems super helpful. Yeah, a lot of good stuff here. So, let's take a look at each one of our teams. Scott's awesome team. First and foremost, we got GitHub.copilot-chat, GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github, pranaygp.vscode-css-peek, aaron-bond.better-comments, and esbenp.prettier-vscode. I got a formatter, I got a CSS tool, I got better comments, I got GitHub integration, and I got AI chat.\nI'm sorry y'all. That's a good team. Seems like the, seems like the popular kids from high school, you know? Like not very good, but of course everyone knows about those. Good. Yeah. Oh, come on. Yeah. My my team name is get done cuz uh, I can lit my code. I can, I can generate types, take really good pictures. My errors are useful. I've got a nice way of handling to-dos. So yeah, my my extensions let me get stuff done. Just the, just the typical thing I think of when I think of getting things done is taking pictures of my code. the influencer.\nGot to let people know. Got to let people know what I'm working on.\nUh, mine is the like productivity functionality master stack. You know, it's just the, if anyone sees me coding, they\n\n\nSay, \"What the hell are you using that? I need that. What is that?\" You know, it's not the popular stuff that Scott picked. Top five, whatever. These are the ones that you're going to want to know how to use. What did you all think of these teams? Which one of these would you rather have? Drop a comment below on who you think won this inaugural draft. Did you like this format? We have a lot of draft ideas in the future. I thought this was super fun, super funny. We have a lot more in the pipeline if you all like this. So, let us know what you thought, but also most importantly, let us know what are your favorite VS Code extensions. What did we miss? And who do you think won? I'll say if you vote for me, I'll gonna pick 10 people and send them syntax stickers.\nThat's not allowed.\n",
