  "cleanText": "Welcome to Syntax. Today we're going to be talking about authentication and authorization and different platforms, but mostly my new favorite platform for doing web authentication on the web. And I will say CJ is going to be doing a deeper explainer video on this. So if you're the type of person who watches this and is like, \"I got to see more code and how to use this,\" just check back on the channel. CJ is going to be doing a video using Better Auth here. So, I will say uh that I personally have a long history with web authentication and we will get into that in just a little bit. My name is Scott. I'm a webdeveloper from Denver. With me as always is Wes. What's up, Wes?\n\nOh, no. Excited to to hear about this. I have not dipped into it yet, so I've got lots of questions for you.\n\nYeah. Yeah, man. I'm all hopped up on a steroid. I'm on a like predinazone or something. So, I'm I got a lot of energy today.\n\nOh, you can't go in the Olympics now.\n\nNo. Yes. Right. No, not that kind of steroid. I don't think they it's like inflammation steroid. So, let me tell you my history with web authentication is I frequently rolled my own web authentication. I wrote my own web authentication for Level Up tutorials because in the initial time that the platform was built, it was built in Meteor. And when I moved it to React and just React and um my own database, I was like, \"Oh, shoot. I was using Meteor's web authentication. So, now I got to build a web authentication that's similar to Meteors, but my own.\" So, I rolled my own. I built it from scratch and it wasn't impossible. I learned a lot. Did it take more than a day? No, absolutely not. But did it take a lot of knowledge and requirements? Yeah. A lot of times people are like, \"Don't even consider rolling your own web authentication.\" It is a treacherous path of demons and it's it's not. You follow a few simple steps. You follow some best practices. Bingo bango, you got an web authentication. But the dialogue for me has changed a little bit in terms of like what web authentication actually is as the years have gone by. And that has led me to actually want to use other platforms for my web authentication instead of rolling my own. We'll talk about that as we go. But if you chose to roll your own web authentication, you're going to want to make sure you have some really good knowledge about how your site is working at all times. And to that, you need something like Sentry. Sentry.io/syntax is the best place to get total visibility into your site. And Sentry has a new feature called Seir, which allows you to get to the root cause of issues on your site quickly and easily using AI. And I gotta say, man, Sentry has done such a good job of being like, \"Let's figure out how AI works inside of our application rather than like Sentry as a whole as an application rather than like, oh, we'll just put a chatbot in the app, right?\" Cuz that's like the solution that so many different companies come up with these days. \"Oh, you need AI, let's throw a chatbot in the app or an autocomplete or something like that.\" So, Sentry has done such a good job experimenting and I got to say this is just one of a handful of incredible tools that Sentry is constantly putting out. So, check them out at Sentry.io.\n\n[Music]\n\nSo, why has my thoughts on web authentication changed over the years? Because what 10 years ago, eight years ago, what was web authentication, right? web authentication, you might have had login with Google, you might have had login with GitHub if you're a developer. You had email and password.\n\nThat was primarily the main you had 2FA on some sites. Uh, and that 2FA could be text message. It could be uh your authenticator app or any of that stuff.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou you didn't have pass keys. Uh you didn't have enter your phone number and we'll send you a text message and now your account is tied to your phone number or whatever like you do on TikTok or whatever. You didn't have that QR code sign in with your phone and now the TV app is then authenticated. You have to type it all.\n\nI love that by the way, man. Whenever I have to sign in to something and it says just pull your phone out and and scan this code.\n\nYes, please.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, I got you. No problem. Uh yeah, that that was that's such a quality of life. Um there's so many. And then like when you get corporate man these like web authentication integrations are are unbelievable be like you have to sign in with your corporate account and web authentication is a very, very complicated and deep well and I don't envy anybody that has to work full-time on web authentication that seems hard.\n\nYeah and it it has only gotten harder and more complicated. And so what are your choices? Your choices are to one use like a paid service like a paid service. There's several like very popular paid services out there to do web authentication that have been around for a while. You have um like Auth0 has been around for a while. They sponsored syntax at some point. They're very reliable application platform for pretty popular right now as well.\n\nClerk is popular. The thing that I have a hold up with these is it's like I like hosting my stuff. I like hosting my stuff where I host all my other stuff. I like it to be part of my database. I don't want to have to pay for a service. I don't want to have to rely on another server for my authentication system. If my authentication system is a part of my like current site, I just don't want to have that. There's other ones. Lucia was a really popular one for a little bit of rolling your own web authentication. It's deprecated now. I always like I always appreciated Lucia existing, but it still felt like you were doing a lot of work to get web authentication going. It gave you some of the tools to get web authentication going, but it was still like I might as well just been rolling my own. And that's the balance I've always found to be a bit tenuous with some of these things. They're either not full-featured enough or they're full-featured and you got to do everything yourself. And by that point, like why am I even using this?\n\nYeah, it's like a little little lower level. Like I use I use Passport\n\nYes.\n\non my website, but like I I have I I have to do all the JWT stuff myself and whatnot. I'm sure that's changed since whenever I I've I've actually implemented it. But yeah, it's it it was more of a lower level primitive where you have to do all of the the heavy lifting yourself.\n\nYes. Um now we have some choices. Um, Arctic. I'd never used or heard of Arctic until when I went to research this episode. So, if you're using Arctic, let me know how you feel about it. Uh, there's a lot of providers here. It's a web authentication client. I've never seen it. Um, the docs aesthetically don't don't give me the warm and fuzzies, but it exists and it was an option. Open web authentication from the uh folks who do SST. Open is great. This is basically a roll your own web authentication.\n\nGives you a little web authentication server. You can sign in with all the different stuff. You can customize the UI a little bit. There's all these different web authentication providers. I like the idea of this. Um I never quite got it. I think there's there's I need to spend a little bit more time with it. If you're out there and you're using Open web authentication and really prefer it, yes, that sounds great. Let me know. But again, it it feels like it's its own web authentication client that just kind of stands alone. It's its own thing, right? There's Next web authentication, which I don't know if you know this, but Next web authentication became web authentication.JS, or at least, yes, they have uh uh opened it up to be more than just Nex.js. It works with all of the stuff. They have example apps with Spellkit. This to me seems like a nice option. This is kind of interesting. Looking for a hosted alternative? Use Clerk. You know, I I I don't have anything bad to say about web authentication.JS, but when I learned about Better Auth, this was the first web authentication platform for me that made me say, \"I got to use this thing\" because it does everything and it does absolutely everything and it connects very well to the tools that you, you know, and love. So, when you get through it, Yeah. like works with all your frameworks. uh multi-factor authentication um you know has support for web authentication or email and password uh members and invitation has a ton of plugins works with all of the good stuff and built in rate limiter that's another thing I had to to write myself as well that's nice so when we go through this I'll show you a little bit about what's so cool about this but I I spent some time this past week implementing both JWT-based web authentication flows as well as your standard session-based cookie web authentication flow with this um using spelt spelt kit and cloudflare workers and using uh D1 and it was really really super painless really super painless um to the point where I was up and running in no time I I was trying to get a whole live store is another local first platform for like yeah that's a whole other topic which we'll talk about some other time and I I hit some snags getting Live Store working in speltkit since there isn't an official implementation just yet. But I got this side of things up and running in no time. I was able to authenticate, log in, all that stuff. So this is to be clear, this is a package for when your server is in JavaScript and they also provide client stuff when you want your UI to be in I guess your UI is always in JavaScript.\n\nYeah. And I don't know specifically there's a a view adapter, a spelt adapter, solid, vanilla, and react.\n\nYeah. And so when I rolled mine, I did make the form myself and I'm just submitting to an endpoint. And in that endpoint, I'm using web authentication.handler as like the the end points. And that is handling all of the end points for me.\n\nDo it yourself. Yeah. I it looks like what they give you is just like sign in, sign up, and session functions.\n\nCorrect. And that's really how I prefer these things to be. Um, personally, cuz I like I, you know, I don't like it going off somewhere and opening on another window or something like that. I want my darn web authentication in my darn app and I want to have control over the form. I want it to look like the rest of my app and I want it to feel nice. In fact, it depends on what you need and want, right? So basically, yeah, you got all this dang stuff. There's a CLI to generate your migrations for you. And if you're using the Drizzle adapter, it generates the Drizzle schema, which then you can just use Drizzle's own migrations for you. If you're using Keysley, it works with all of the OMS.\n\nSo the CLI is really great. You just run a generate command and it gives you the migration files. Oh man, there's just so many um nice things here uh that that in terms of like when you need to to have a specific style of web authentication, it can handle it for you. Because some of these platforms are like, \"We do session-based web authentication and that's it.\" With this, it's like, \"If I want to do session-based web authentication, I got it. If I want to do JWT, like I said, I got it. If I want to connect it to my own database, I got it. There's no problems there. Or if I want to have a database just for web authentication, you can do that, too. Um, it even connects directly uh to email and you can add email uh verification directly from uh Better Auth which is something when I I was working on an email client for my platform dropin west this was built into my web authentication client because back in Meteor days that was built in and like all these that like sending an email with authentication is something you always got to do. So, like it makes so much sense to have email verification and all that stuff being a part and and it it's really mostly just like the hooks, right? Because you you're writing and bringing in your own email platforms, but it's it's creating the emails for you. It's well, it's you're creating the emails, but it it's it's giving you those hooks to send the verifications. It's all providing you reset tokens and expiring and all that. Yeah. See, I I wrote all that myself as well.\n\nYes. Nice. I've written two factor web authentication myself. So, I've done all of this stuff, rolled my own. And I got to say that is so nice that it like here's your token, here's your URL, send, reset, password. Got to have it. And, you know, it gives you hooks for everything. It lets you tap in here if you want to tap in. There's uh plugins to add in a whole plug-in system, which we'll talk about a little bit. Um, like we mentioned, there's web authentication providers. So, if you just want signin with Google, you don't even have to darn set anything up for that. You're just bringing in your ID. Next thing you know, like that's the easiest possible way to get up and running with this in no time. Um, rate limiting is just a couple of properties when you're configuring your web authentication. You want a rate limit, you can add a rate limit. Rate limit enabled. True. Done. Bingo. Bango. Like, man, it they it's like we know exactly what you want with web authentication and what you do with web authentication and we're just going to make it do everything for you. Again, session management can be enabled and if you have session management, you can choose how long those sessions are. And again, it generates the database schemas and everything for you. You're not having to ever write a database schema with this thing, which I've written a ton of those for web authentication, I'll tell you that.\n\nYeah. Oh, and there's capture integration, which is is key as well, cuz I was I was thinking about like looking at the rate limiting. I was like, \"Yeah, rate limiting is is one part of it. You know, you don't want people hitting your signup end points too often. But then there's also you have to throw a capture in there when people are trying to sign in.\"\n\nThere's even like update user functions and stuff like that which\n\nyes delete user update user.\n\nIt's very refreshing.\n\nIt's very refreshing. Um and I'm just like you know so many times when you see things like this there's a lot of big promises made and underdelivered. This thing has flown so far under the\n\n\nRadar.\nTo me, that by the time I'm seeing it, it is a full-grown ass man of a package.\nIt has everything in here.\nUm, social sign-ons.\nYou could sign in with Roblox if you want to sign in with Roblox.\nYou can do that.\nSign in with any of this stuff, Hugging Face, or any of these things.\nThe database integration.\nIt works with MySQL, SQLite, Postgres.\nUm, it has adapters for Drizzle, Prisma, MongoDB, everything.\nI'm telling you, when I got this up and running with uh D1, it was as simple as uh just using the SQLite adapters and and bingo bingo.\nAnd I did it with Drizzle, actually, just cuz Drizzle makes a lot of sense for that.\nSo, Drizzle, SQLite, D1, you're good to go.\nIntegrations.\nThere's integrations for all of your stuff: Astro, Remix, Nook, Spell.\nLike, who wrote all this code?\nThis is so much stuff, and it's great.\nUm, can't be known.\nYeah, it's awesome.\nIt works with everything here.\nAnd the plug-in ecosystem is wonderful.\nSo, let's talk about the plugins.\nAnd folks, this is not a paid product.\nThis is something you can just use.\nThis is not an advertisement.\nThis is me just gushing about something I like.\nUh, you got two-factor off that can come with the 2FA, one-time passwords, time-based one passwords.\nYou can get all of that.\nIt's a plugin.\nStandard username and password.\nYou can get anonymous login.\nYou can do the whole phone number and send a one-time password over the phone.\nYou want to log in like a pro like TikTok?\nThey got you on that one.\nSuper nice.\nUh, it is in here.\nMagic link off.\nIf you're the type of person who likes to go to an email, uh, one-time password, I both love and hate magic links so much.\nThere's a time, there's a time when I like them and a time when I hate them.\nAnd it depends on the...\nwhen I'm just like, I don't know what my password is, send me a link.\nThat's fine.\nBut half the time I'm sitting there waiting, like, I don't know, 10 seconds for them to send the email and then another 10, 15 seconds for my email to refresh, and it's just like, come on, let me in.\nPass keys has been the best experience I've had ever with authentication because it just pops up.\nYou want to sign with pass key, you hit the button, you, I don't know, you scan your face or your palm or whatever you need to do, and then boom, you're in.\nYou don't have to do all this dancing: send me an email, let me copy this stupid code, or let me, let me use the SMS token.\nI hate that as well.\nThat seems like everybody's, everybody's doing SMS right now.\nYep.\nUh, so pass key in here.\nWhat is this?\nOne tap allows a single tap using Google's one-tap API.\nI've...\nOneTap is Google, like sign in with Google.\nUm, when they released it, sites were like very aggressively popping it up, and it was really annoying because like you could just visit a random website and be like, sign in with Google or sign up with Google, and you just have to hit it.\nIt does some weird, like, it iframes in the Google thing, so it will show like your, your face and your icon and your email address and everything, but the site can't access that until you explicitly allow it.\nBut that is a nice, in some cases, it can be a nice experience if you open it up uh properly.\nI think Google fixed that though because I haven't had that annoyance in a while.\nYeah.\nEven more additional features: admin stuff.\nListen to this.\nAdmin provides a set of administrative functions for user management.\nAllow for uh uh creating users, managing roles, banning and unbanning, and impersonating users.\nThis is stuff that every single O system needs to have in it.\nAnd and oftentimes you're writing that yourself.\nI've written an impersonation system.\nI've written an abanning and unbanning.\nI called it the ban hammer, and it was uh, it was pretty, it was pretty fun to use, but like I would have rather not having to wrote it myself.\nUm, that's for sure.\nUm...\nWait, so you said there's, there's a whole banning system.\nYes.\nYes.\nBanning and unbanning.\nUh, impersonating, creating and managing from an admin side of things.\nWow.\nSo is this, this doesn't get into like rolls and and access, does it?\nRolls?\nIt gets into setting roles.\nUm, really...\nyes, setting roles, uh, set, but it...\nthe whole access controls built in, brother.\nI'm telling you, this thing absolutely rules.\nUm, and then MCP, MCP plugin lets you act as an ooth provider for MCP clients if you need that.\nUh, I dude, there is just, it's too much stuff in here, uh, in terms of like, it just does it all, dang all.\nUm, single support, single sign-on, um, bearer tokens, like you said, capture, there's a feature in here that uh can check for have I been pawned database to know if your password has been involved in any sort of data leaks, multi-session, um, active multiple sessions across different accounts from the same browser.\nMan, there is just so many things.\nThere's even a Stripe plugin.\nListen, what the Stripe plugin does: process subscription life cycle event.\nSo, you can probably change roles based on a subscription, like...\nOh, that's a good call.\nYou keep those in in sync.\nAnd and like...\nYeah, man.\nAnd there's guides.\nThe docs are great.\nUm, here you want to use it with or want to migrate from Superbase or Next or Clerk, you can do that.\nAh man, I got to say Better Auth folks.\nIt...\nhow does this hook up to to your users like this?\nDoes this also take care of like what a user is or or in creating the...\nwhat if you have existing like users, you probably can hook that up, right?\nI, you know, there's, there's references on here on how to migrate from other platforms.\nSo I would look into that because I don't know how you would migrate, like, given that like the hashing algorithms and stuff depends on what this uses and what that uses.\nI don't know.\nI don't know uh exactly how...\nIf you store your passwords as plain text, you don't have that problem.\nIf you store your passwords as plain text, you don't have that problem.\nBut what it does give you, it spits all this stuff out.\nLike I said, it spits out the schemas that you then use to do the migrations, or it spits out just straight up migration files for you.\nSo again, like you tell it what you need, and it's either giving you the session table, the user table, whatever the admin tables, it's giving you all that stuff, and then if you add features, it's giving you the migrations for those.\nYou can use it with whatever OM or whatever solution you're doing to manage your migrations, or you can write uh those by hands with the SQL files that it pumps out of here for you.\nSo it, it live, the reason I like this so much is it lives a part of your database where your data is if you wanted to, if you want to keep your users with all your other stuff.\nUh, it just lives there.\nSomeone, I don't, I don't think this exists, but someone needs to build this.\nIs there like a a UI, you know how like Drizzle Kit has or Drizzle has Drizzle Kit, which is kind of just a UI for managing the database.\nYeah.\nWhat I want with this is a UI for all of the user management, you know, like see active sessions, uh, look at all the roles, assign new roles, remove roles, like there the whole UI around that user management and like access control and sessions and banning and unbanning, all of that is that's a that's a very complex UI.\nIt would be really nice to have like some sort of thing you could drop in that allows you to query filter for all of this.\nAnd it feels like that would be relatively easy given that there is all of like with the admin the plugin here, like you know you can list users with a specific query, get all those users, you can ban and you can manage those things really easily from the O uh client.\nSo like to me that like the UI part of it would be really nice to have as just like an addition to this based on whatever you're using.\nUm, yeah, people out there are probably wondering what is the effing catch?\nWhat's the catch here?\nUh, yeah, it says they've raised $5 million.\nIs is there a rug pull coming?\nThere is not a rug pulling.\nOne thing that I really appreciate about these folks is that there is a product behind this, but the product does not take away from the open-source side of things.\nSo, like what does, like where is that product?\nUm, uh...\nyou can't even find it.\nThat's good.\nYeah, which is funny because I, I've actually, I've signed up for the...\nWow.\nInteresting.\nThey just have this, I've signed up for it at some point to join the weight list.\nSo the product is a managed version essentially, like Clerk or something like that if you don't want to add it into your stack.\nBut it also includes all of the things that you would need uh like for sending email and SMS.\nSo it's you're not having to bring your own email.\nYou're not having to bring your own SMS and like hook it up to Twilio or whatever, right?\nYou're not having to bring all that stuff.\nIt includes all of that.\nSo, it's just like, hey, we, we've given you the components.\nYou can hook it up to your own stuff.\nBut now, and and here's one that you'll notice: a unified dashboard to manage users and user analytics.\nSo, it's giving you that analytics dashboard.\nAnd um...\nOh, that's what I was just talking about, that UI component.\nThat's probably would be one of their paid features.\nYeah.\nYes.\nAnd it looks good, and it doesn't look like something that I would be paying for because I honestly don't need this.\nUm, but I am one of these 4,000 people that have joined the weight list because I do think the product looks good, but it's not removing any of the stuff that I would actually need to want to use this.\nSo, yeah.\nYeah, or like, like what a lot of people do as well with O is there you have an idea, you just you need to build a product, you just throw a hosted O in there as quick as possible because you're like, I'm not, I'm excited about the product, I'm not excited about like hashing JT tokens and and whatnot, like I'm not going to spend forever on that.\nSo you just slap that in there.\nSo, it's nice to know that you'd be able to like duck out to this thing if you needed to.\nAnd Better Auth folks, like the developers behind this.\nGosh, you guys are just guys and gals, whoever is doing this are on it.\nThey even have an LLM.txt of their entire docs uh done in Markdown uh for LLM consumption.\nSo if you're the type of person who wants to just pass this into cursor and have it available to reference, they, they, they got you on that too.\nSo um, llms.txt is one of my new favorite things that a lot of folks are doing um to give you just quickly and easily uh consumable documentation in text form, and uh they got that too.\nSo Dan, if you need, if you need, if you need a new off solution in your life that like doesn't provide a lot of pain, man, this is not an ad.\nObviously, they're, they're not making any money even yet.\nThere's no product.\nUm, but I've used it.\nI've been to the edge and back.\nI've tried it.\nIt was great.\nI used it for two different types of off flows, and it was easy to change between them.\nI changed between them in a couple minutes.\nIt's just random migration.\nChanged some code around, saved my JWT or whatever, and now I'm in with a JWT-based off if I want it.\nDocs are very nice and uh easily consumable.\nAnd there's just, there's just a lot of good stuff here.\nSo, I don't, I don't have any additional thoughts other than Better Auth truly is like the thing that's made me reconsider writing my own O, and I will be using this going forward.\nAnd I'm gonna dump, I'm gonna dump the O package that I was writing because this is like 10,000 times better and uh has wider coverage than anything I could possibly do by my own.\nSo, shout out to Better Auth team.\nAwesome.\nAll right.\nThanks so much for tuning in and thanks for the explanation, Scott.\nAnd we will catch you later.\nPeace.\n",
