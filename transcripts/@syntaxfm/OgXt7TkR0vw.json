  "cleanText": "What's up, everybody? We got another framework snake draft. That's how we're saying it. We are going to be picking the technology we would use to build a full stack application like a SAS or a social network or something like that. So we got to pick a database, an ORM, a UI framework, a meta framework, where we're going to host it, CSS methodology, and then anything goes at the end. And we're allowed to cheat, steal, borrow from each other. It's going to be blood bath.\n\nAnd before we get started, let's go ahead. Uh, just so everybody can see, I'm going to randomize the names, the order in which we're going to go in the snake draft. So, I'm going to click randomize. 1, 2, 3.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nOh, wow. It did not change. Okay, CJ is going to kick it off. 30 seconds on the board to make his pick.\n\nYeah, I'm going to make it easy and I don't think you guys are going to steal this. So, I'm picking Vue and Nux as my UI and meta framework. Uh, I recently released a course on it. I love it. It's the best. I choose viewing next.\n\nCan we also just acknowledge that no matter what CJ picks, everyone's going to be like, CJ wins.\n\nYeah. No, honestly, CJ's been botting the comments lately with all these like anonymous accounts being like, CJ did the best job when it clearly did not.\n\nI'm not bing. I I just have some very loyal fans. I think that's what he does.\n\nI know. I know. I think I think it's you've got some sort of like Yeah. whole whole bot of everyone.\n\nIt's going to be it's going to be even worse this time cuz you guys made it called attention to it. So, yes.\n\nNo. Everyone please say that Scott and I do better.\n\nOkay. Yeah. So, viewucks off the board unless somebody wants to steal it. Um I'm on the clock. I'm going to say I am picking Postgress database tech first round.\n\nAll right. Um I'm going to go with SQLite as my database and I'm going to go and pick Drizzle as my OM right away. Those are my two shots.\n\nWait, you can pick two at once?\n\nYeah. Well, I'm It's Snake. I'm on the last one. So, I finished the first turn and we snaked around.\n\nThat makes sense. Yeah, that's a snake. You know how snakes work like this? Yeah.\n\nYes. That's a lot of fun. Uh I got to pick something now. I am going to\n\n[Music]\n\nI don't want anybody stealing my stuff. Uh I'm going to host on AWS.\n\nLike are you are you going to like self-host EC2 or or some of the higher level services or Lambda?\n\nI mean I'm going to do it via SST, but it's going to be on AWS.\n\nGotcha. Yeah. Okay. Uh, so I first am going to steal Postgress from Scott CJ.\n\nAll right. Well, got a 10 seconds to pick a new database tech.\n\nI was going to steal uh Drizzle, but now I can't. Um Oh, I don't have to pick a new database tech. I'm going to pick Spelkit.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay. Oh, wow. Okay. So, you're without a you're without a database right now.\n\nOkay.\n\nCurrently, and because we're snaking, I go again. Right. This is how it works.\n\nYes. Great. I'm going to also steal Drizzle.\n\nYou cannot do two steel.\n\nI can't. Well, it's a new round.\n\nWe get one steel per game.\n\nThe whole per game.\n\nOne steal per game.\n\nNo, that steals you both grass.\n\nNo, last time we You guys stole multiple times.\n\nNo, we didn't. Sorry.\n\nWes stole from me and I stole back from Wes. That's how we\n\nThere is There is no rule that says we can only steal once per game in just said it. there. It says right up above, each person gets one steel for the entire draft.\n\nOkay, that's fine. I'm happy with progress. It's got a vector database. It supports JSON. I'm happy with that steel. Uh but because I can't have Drizzle, I am going to choose Keysley as my overhead.\n\nThat was my backup.\n\nYeah. Have you guys used Keysley?\n\nI have not actually. All I know that is the Drizzle and Keysley guys fight a lot on on Twitter.\n\nDo they?\n\nYeah.\n\nThey have a lot in common. They're all about Typescript. So I I I used to use connects back in the day and then Keysley is like a much more type- safe version of Connects. It's a query builder. Not exactly an OM, but yeah, Keysley is my choice.\n\nYeah, people seem to like Keysley. Okay, that puts me in the hot seat.\n\nGosh, I don't have an OM or database and uh UIM. Well, I'm going to use my steel and steal Postgress back.\n\nWhoa, crazy. Okay. Um, yeah, I have Keyasley. I want to stick with a SQLite with a SQL database. I've already stolen, so I can't steal again, right? Even though you guys have wasted your steals. That means I can take anything I want on my last turn.\n\nUh, I'm going to go with I'm going to go with uh my sequel then cuz it, you know, it's getting there. Full faithful. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Syntax sites in my my SQL. MySQL my squeal my SQL.\n\nUm I am going to since neither of you guys can can steal I'm going to go with vanilla CSS or modern CSS as my my CSS approach. You know nesting scoping donut scope. L literally any of the new features that don't work. By the way, half of the brain deadad people that watched our last one were like I clicked on Wes's example and it didn't work. like watch the episode. It's It's future tech. You got to turn the setting on in your browser.\n\nI agree. Uh Wes, you broke my heart with that one, but yeah, I knew it. I knew you were going to take it and I was like, \"Well, you can't.\"\n\nYou pick again, Wes.\n\nOh, man. I get to go again. All right. Um for my framework, I'm going with Tanstack Start. Tanstack start comes with Tanstack query, comes with the router, comes with React, obviously. Feeling pretty good about that. No, no server components yet, but future future upgrade.\n\nThat's a good pick cuz it's an all-in-one. You get multiple libraries for for one.\n\nYeah, I don't have to worry about like data loading or or anything that's state management. I maybe state management, but most of that can be done with with 10 with the query.\n\nNice. All right. Um I need\n\nNo, it's my turn.\n\nNo, it's okay. It's not my turn.\n\nIt's snakes. Do you understand how snakes work?\n\nNo, I don't. I need to see a list. I need What order are we in?\n\nGuys, guess what I'm picking? I'm picking Tailwind from the top rope. It's mine.\n\nInsufferable Tailwind enjoyer Scott. Of course.\n\nYeah. You've been forced to actually learn it and like it. Cool.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay. It's my turn now.\n\nYes.\n\nYes. Okay. I I need a CSS methodology. I mean, like technically Vue has scoped styles, so it's not too crazy to kind of just use the stuff that's built in. I I kind of want to pick Daisy UI. So, it is higher level, right? It's built on top of Tailwind. Would you guys allow it if I picked Daisy UI, even though Tailwind has already been picked? It has classes that are built up of Tailwind styles.\n\nYeah, like it it it comes with like UI as well, right? And it's it also comes with like does it have components?\n\nI don't know. You know what? It says Tailwind directly in the headline. Like faster, cleaner, easier. Tailwind.\n\nNo, I'm going to stepping on my toes there. you wouldn't be able to use shad CN or any it I'm quite frankly I'm surprised Scott that you just went straight up Tailwind and not like something that comes with like like a Radex or it's a C CSS methodology CSS not a UI thing component they have their own rendering engine yes but what I'm saying is is that like the the category isn't a UI framework in terms of like shad CN or whatever\n\nI'm going to allow it I'm going to allow it that's an insane allow in in an attempt to get the comments to like me, I'm going to allow it for CJ.\n\nOkay. Well, I appreciate that you allowed it, but I'm just going to switch to CSS modules to make it interesting.\n\nAll right, that's a good call.\n\nYeah, because it, you know, you can still have them separate. You can import them into components CSS.\n\nI think that fits the brief better.\n\nThe scope CSS in like I'm assuming in Vue, but in likelta as well as I'm pretty sure that is just CSS modules, you know, it does the same thing, same rules, similar thing. Yeah. All right, you're up again, CJ. As this comes back to you.\n\nUm, I am going to choose for my hosting provider. I'm gonna choose Cloudflare.\n\nAnd is everyone out of steals or is that going to be stolen from you?\n\nStolen anything yet?\n\nWes has not stolen anything. So, see, get ready to learn uh GoDaddy. CJ, how good are you at C panel?\n\nPretty decent. Pretty decent, but yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay. I need an OM. I need an OM. I need an OM. You know what? This gets a bad rap for no gosh darn good reason. We use it on syntax. It's getting better all the time. I'm going to go with Prisma because you know what? It includes all the stuff. It includes all the good stuff. And uh LLM's really know Prisma. if you want to go ahead and be like, \"Generate me this stuff.\"\n\nPrisma Studio is so good.\n\nIt's good.\n\nUm, so I need a I just need a hosting provider yet, right? And then a wild card. All right, my hosting provider. I'm I'm I'm torn between like a like self-hosting with a Koolifi, but I think I'm going to steal Cloudflare workers from CJ so that I can get images and stats and cues and all of that good stuff for free comes along with it.\n\nYeah.\n\nNew is a good deal.\n\nOkay, 10 seconds. I don't want to pick the V-word, so I'm going to pick netifi. two view. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I don't I don't even know if Netifi supports NX.\n\nOh, I'm sure it does.\n\nOkay. But yeah, and supports everything. I've only used Netifi for like static sites. So, uh for this for this app, I'm committing to to learn a new stack. Netify.\n\nYeah, Netify supports Netlefi. Yes. Hires like has like several people on staff just to make sure that the frameworks work well within them. And they also have Dino. Like I'm hosting a Dino app on Netlifi which is really cool.\n\nI'm still hosting quite a bit on Netlefi and I choose to just cuz it's it's nice.\n\nYeah, it's great.\n\nAll right, Wes, wild card time, baby.\n\nBack to me.\n\nIt's a snake.\n\nNo, it I think it's doesn't just go though.\n\nYeah, but he was a steel so\n\nOh, okay. Okay. Oh, back to me again then. Okay. Yeah. All right. The snake is confusing.\n\nOh, man. Um Snake Rad X if you want. Now snake. Um I'm going to go with Open AI. NPM install Open AI. And that way I can use any of the AI providers. And\n\nI love how you clown on me for picking copilot in the last one because of the AI stuff. And look at you in your wild card.\n\nYes. Well, yep. All right. On my wild card, uh, I'm going to pick something that pairs excellently with my stack of Prisma and Postgress. And I'm throwing in zero sync because zero sync. There's even an adapter for Prisma to go right into the zero sync cookie. So, what a stack.\n\nYeah. Okay. I my last pick. I have to choose a wild card. I don't know how to round out this stack cuz like I mean I could build anything at this point. It just it's just a matter of like what I'm building specifically and then I might branch off from there. I like the idea of including AI. So, I'm actually going to go with uh Langchain. Lang Chain does let you talk to all the different AI APIs and they have a bunch of built-in stuff with like uh prompt templates and and like consuming documents.\n\nYeah. And and al like Yeah. And uh like retrieval augmented generation and stuff like that. So, yeah, I'm going with Lang Chain.\n\nLang Chain is good, man.\n\nSick. Or should we go through our stacks then?\n\nLet's do it. Maybe we should give them a name, too.\n\nAll right. Yeah, let's let's give us like 5 seconds while we develop a name for our stacks and then we'll let the comments decide who does the best.\n\nCJ, since you are the first, you can give us your the stack name and then the items in your stack and maybe a little bit about why you named it what you named it.\n\nWell, mine's an acronym and that's why people are going to vote for it because this is the Vulcan stack.\n\nWhat?\n\nUh, so V is for view and next. Oh, that's the V and the U. The L is for link chain cuz we're going to have some AI in our app. It's we're going to get lots of investors. It's going to be great. Uh the C is for CSS modules. Uh it's nice and uh reusable and doesn't pollute out from uh from your components. The A is also for lane chain and then the N is for uh Netlefi. I have to figure I have to fit my SQL in there somewhere. But the the L is for my SQL. The A is for link chain. Um, but that's my stack, the Vulcan stack.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah,\n\nI love I love the name. Um, that's a cool name. Yeah, it's a cool name. Let's see. My stack is the smooth stack. And it's just like the ocean under the moon. It's the same kind of emotion that I get from you. You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth. Uh, give me your heart. Make\n\n\nIt's real. Let's not forget about it. The smooth stack. And in the smooth stack, we got Spelkit, very smooth. Uh AWS, well, it's only smooth with SST, but it can be smooth. Uh Postgress, clearly the smoothest DB. Tailwind, smooth experience all around. Uh it's kind of windy. And uh Prisma, easy smooth. And Zerosync, fast uh friendly, smooth. So the smooth stack. Nice.\n\nAll right. Mine is called the STD version five company. It's actually so like it's an open source project but there's like a company behind it, you know, to make it sustainable.\n\nUm so the the STD5 company is the um STD is SQLite Tanstack and Drizzle. The V5 is for vanilla CSS and the company is Cloudflare OpenAI, you know.\n\nUm really excited to launch what we have some really exciting investors behind the STD V5 company and um we're going to put uh like V0 index zero all of these zero companies out of uh V5 is five is more than zero so we're excited to beat everybody.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut zero is number one in index base indexing zerobased indexing. So yes but it's also a falsy value in JavaScript. So, unfortunately, that is not good.\n\nAll right, thank you so much for watching. Let us know down in the comments which of these stacks you think is the best and one. And, uh, yeah, thanks for tuning in. Uh, check out these videos of us doing similar stuff and we'll see you in the next\n",
