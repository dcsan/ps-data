  "cleanText": "Welcome to Syntax.\nToday we're going to be talking about surfing the web with browsers.\nThat's right.\nWe're going to be talking all about the web browser landscape in 2025.\nWhere things are at, what rendering engines exist and who's using what and even just a little bit of fun conversation around some niche browsers and stuff like that.\nMy name is Scott Stolinski.\nI'm a developer from Denver.\nWith me as always is Wes Bos.\nWhat's up, my man?\nHey, stoked to talk about this.\nThere's it feels like the browser landscape is is kind of shifting right now.\nUm not towards like like lower level engines although there are some new players in that space.\nWe'll talk about that but more towards like the actual using of it.\nI think all this like AI tooling and whatnot has has made a lot of people reconsider it.\nUm, and then they're also all all of this AI tooling is also making a lot of people reconsider leaving it as well when they try to stuff it down your throat in every single possible way.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nTotally.\nI mean, it is it's interesting and I I think there's a lot to hear.\nAnd you know what?\nBefore we get off the jump, people got a lot of strong opinions on browsers.\nJust know that your your favorite browser might not just be the best browser in the entire world, no questions asked, because there's always give and takes with any of this stuff.\nI I I always feel like anytime we talk about browsers or anybody does in the comments, it's crazy just how overwhelmingly skewed the comments are like Firefox is the only browser and then you like look at the usage statistics and it's like 10 people using it.\nSo, we'll get into it a little bit first, but let's start with some of the rendering engine based talk.\nWe can uh start with the most used, most popular rendering engine out there, which is Blink.\nUm, these are the Chromiumbased browsers typically.\nAnd there's a handful of these things.\nChrome being the most popular one.\nI actually have ended up being using Chrome Canary full-time.\nCanary is like the pre-release version of Chrome.\nSo, that's been my browser full time for the past couple of weeks or my default browser even though I still have Arc set up.\nThen, how long were you on Arc for?\nOh, since it came out and I'm I'm I'm weaning.\nI'm I'm having a hard time.\nI'm only getting off Arc because like there's some crazy stuff that happens on.\nlike it's like gone into like total like use at your own risk mode and people will be like it's fine for me and it's like you know what as an Arc fanatic I've held out so long and I wish I could say it was it was fine to use right now but it is it is showing its um lack of maintenance.\nI'll say that.\nUm so you have Edge which is Microsoft's uh Chromium which is you know their successor to Internet Explorer in many ways but like more or less a a version of uh Chromium with a lot of Microsoft stuff and and if I understand correctly you use Edge full-time.\nIs that correct?\nYeah, I was so I was on Firefox for probably six years and about a year ago I switched to Edge and I've been been really happy with it both because of the dev tools also because of of what how it looks and how you can customize it out of the box.\nIt's it's absolutely awful.\nyou have to turn off like games and like all this like like Microsoft Clippy and and like sign in with like Chipotle and all these like weird things, but you turn them all off and it's it's actually a really nice browser, especially the the Dev Tools.\nUm it's been slightly tweaked here and there.\nUm they do have people working on the actual engine as well in the Dev Tools, so it's not like they're just taking Chrome and slapping a Microsoft logo on it.\nSo, I've been been pretty happy with it.\nAlthough, every time I talk about it, everybody says, \"Why not Brave?\"\nUm, I I don't really have an answer there.\nUh, yeah.\nUnfortunately, Bra just kind of exists, right?\nAnd and it's one of those things where I'm like, it is just a a Chrome, you know, skin in a way with some ad blocker and some built-in VPN.\nI I think the thing that turned me off, I did use Brave for a while.\nThe thing that turned me off from using Brave was really that it was like we are the crypto browser and you know it's not like I'm I mean to an extent you know the cryptocurrency stuff or the web 3 stuff it it it still exists.\nIt's not like gone by any means or something like that you know there what Bitcoin just hit an all-time high and things like it's ever been.\nYeah.\nRight.\nSo in that regard great and the hype cycle for crypto I feel like is at the least annoying it's ever been.\nyou know, you you you don't I mean, it maybe not the least annoying it's ever been.\nI maybe like 2012 was the least annoying it's ever been, but it is interesting that they have kind of moved away from that in their advertising uh where it's like Brave is the the private search, the AI assistant, the VPN browser, and then there is the the BAT uh token stuff as well.\nBut it does seem like even they have been like, \"Well, let's turn that knob down just a little bit.\"\nUm, in terms of how exactly we're pumping that.\nI I actually in prepping for this episode, I I I started to look at Brave and started to think like, maybe I should use Brave.\nI am using Chrome already and it is basically Chrome with some extra stuff.\nSo, I don't know.\nI might give Brave a rip for a little bit.\nGive it a shot.\nAnd if you want to see all of the errors in your application, you'll want to check out Sentry at Sentry.io/syntax.\nYou don't want a production application out there that well, you have no visibility into in case something is blowing up and you might not even know it.\nSo head on over to Sentry.io/syntax.\nAgain, we've been using this tool for a long time and it totally rules.\nAll right.\nSo, one killer feature of using either Brave or Edge is that they still support Google Manifest version two, meaning that you can use the older ad block extensions, right?\nAnd that's great.\nI know Microsoft Edge has said that they will eventually deprecate V2, but the thing about Microsoft is they love enterprise.\nAnd if there is one enterprise user using some random extension, they're they're not going to like hurt them, right?\nThat's that's the reason why we had IE stick around for so long.\nSo I've if they do take away manifest v2, I'll I'll have to like I don't know.\nHave you tried the like the the V3 ad block?\nall we had Oliver on the podcast talking about how how good it is and whatnot, but I haven't haven't switched over to it yet.\nYeah, you know, I couldn't tell you.\nI use whatever is baked into Arc, but like on Chrome, are you using an ad blocker?\nI am.\nLet me check.\nUh, no, which is crazy.\nBut like I I'm I'm mostly using Chrome right now for development just because my my browsing life has been so wrapped up into Arc.\nIt's like I still have all my tabs and stuff in there and I still have Arc open.\nSo it's like Yeah.\nSo when I say I switched over, it is Yeah, it is my like development browser.\nI have all new links open up in Chrome.\nBut yeah, I it's crazy that I haven't been running an ad blocker on this thing.\nUm maybe I should just move over to Brave.\ngive it a shot and let us know.\nUh, but also there's Opera in Opera GX.\nWhat's the difference there?\nYeah, I'll tell you what, man.\nThis is so funny.\nI accidentally installed Opera GX because I just Googled Opera and I was like, \"Oo, a new Opera named Opera GX.\nThis must be the latest one with its cool name.\"\nAnd uh, oh man, Opera GX is a wild experience, Wes.\nIt's like what if we took the year 2004 flash aesthetic and put it as the default for a browser and the browser has interface kind of like theme uh sounds and stuff like that and it it honestly feels like you stepped into uh Tron or Tron the Ride and you're like all of a sudden this is my browser.\nUm I I I found it to be a bewildering experience honestly.\nUh Opera GX is a crazy place to be.\nUm, and it it made me feel very old.\nI will tell you that I opened up this browser and I was like, I'm old.\nThis thing's crazy.\nUm, and then I moved.\nOpera Air as well.\nOkay.\nOpera Air is the world's first browser with mindfulness at its core.\nExperience a focus, balance, and stressfree web.\nOkay.\nIt tells you to like do neck exercises and meditation.\nWhat the hell?\nWhat are they what are they smoking over there at opera?\nBecause like the why do we need opera air?\nOpera and Opera GX.\nOpera GX.\nAnd I will tell you something was very funny because you think Opera GX might just be a skinned version of it.\nAnd it was like a skinned version of Opera, but there was like several features that were missing from actual Opera that were in GX like import like when you do the import from browser or whatever.\nOpera showed like three browser options and then Opera GX was like import from these eight OP browser options.\nIt's like this is the same window just skinned differently.\nWhy is the main Opera so much like why does it have less options than Opera GX there?\nI don't know.\nIt's crazy world.\nThat's hilarious.\nIt just goes to show that the fact that they have Opera GX and Opera Air like web developers are not the primary audience of any of these companies.\nAnd as much as it kills us uh to to hear that, it's they're trying to make money off of regular users trying to browse the web and that's why they're trying to push all these features like mindfulness and AI.\nYeah.\nAnd and in case Opera GX is like the browser for gamers and it's like the archetype of the person who's using Opera GX is like some 18-year-old wearing Crocs like this browsing the web.\nIt's like that's who they're going for.\nIt's not me, I guess.\nUh oh.\nAnd what else do we have?\nWe have Vivaldi.\nUm which seems to be Vivaldi.\nVivaldi.\nOh my gosh.\nDo you do you not know who Vivaldi is?\nUh no, I don't.\nIt's sounds like a musician or something.\nYes, he's the Red Priest.\nHe's a famous uh I know who that is then.\nViolinist, I But basically they have a another version of Chrome which is is one of these browsers with all kinds of features built into it.\nUm certainly this one seems more like a power user browser.\nSo maybe I should give this a shot.\nIt's existed for a long time.\nVivaldi has been around for a very long time and it's probably one of the only one of these I've never installed which is very odd because I I I feel like I have every browser installed all the time.\nUm, so Vivaldi, it's out there.\nIt exists.\nIf you're out there in Vivaldi, Opera, or Opera GX is your number one browser, I want you to leave a comment below telling us why because I'm interested.\nHonestly, I'm interested.\nI think they're neat, but at the end of the day, again, they're just kind of Chrome extensions with uh various Yeah.\nvarious additions onto them.\nYeah.\nLet's Let's talk about Arc, though.\nSo Arc was like the Everybody loved it.\nit was this like what what would you explain it?\nIt was a kind of a new UI.\nUm and everybody was going crazy over it.\nUh everybody loved it.\nAnd then I don't know probably be 6 months a year ago they announced that they are no longer going to be working on Arc and they're they're launching a new one called Dia.\nDia.\nYeah, I would say Dia.\nI would say DIA.\nUm yeah, it's I found the announcement to be kind of bewildering.\nlike Arc is dead now we're making a new browser.\nYeah.\nBut they just released a blog post uh explaining kind of like you know why they chose to release a new browser.\nI do find it like you know the the explanation it largely comes down to they built too much too quickly and bloated Arc which yes they did.\nAnd the iOS app is bewildering.\nThey had one iOS app and then they released a second one that was like a kind of less featured version and if you if you move the phone the wrong way then like a fake phone dialer pops up and I'm just like what is going on here?\nUh so I get it.\nBut like I do feel like you could have still built on a new foundation and just called it ARC 2, you know, like it's it's ARC even though because they're both chromium based.\nThey both look similar in some ways, but like just to be like, you know what, we're done and we're picking a new one.\nIt's still weird to me.\nThat said, uh DIA is kind of the AI first browser and it's going to be a not a next generation version of Arc because if you look at the two, Dia doesn't have like the whole side tab layout and stuff like that.\nIt it is like normal tabs, but it is more like using the web via a cursor.\nSo they were basically like, well, let's rethink the browser with Arc.\nAnd Arc had a number of features like it had one, you don't see the URL bar bar by default, which I don't know why that wigs some people out.\nI know what website I'm on.\nI have object permanence.\nI'm not going to like be like, \"Oh, where'd I go?\"\nYou know, or you when you hit command T, it brings up a pro like a Raycast type deal.\nWhen you start typing, it'll autocomplete.\nIt'll open bookmarks.\nit will open the tab already if you have the tab already open and has all kinds of built-in pinning and workspaces.\nSo like when you're in your default workspace, you just do a two-finger swipe over.\nNext thing you know, you're in a new workspace with new login, a new container, whatever.\nAnd that feels so good.\nThe UI on Arc from day one was like the best.\nAnd it took a little bit of getting used to, but once you did, you're like, \"This is a new experience for a web browser.\"\nand they nailed it.\nSo that's why I think people were a little like, yeah, what's going on here?\nWhy why did they abandon this?\nBut at the end of the day, it does seem like Ark had some challenges.\nIt wasn't necessarily getting the adoption they wanted it to get and were like, you know what,\n\n\nLet's just start fresh.\nAnd I do think it's pissing off a lot of the Arc power users.\nUh, I don't think that they necessarily care.\nUh, I don't think they care.\nUm, yeah.\nMy hottest take is that you cannot make money on software power users, and it honestly makes me worried for apps like Raycast or Warp or a lot of these apps where you see them starting to push a little harder on the AI subscriptions because people absolutely love the apps, but when you've raised so much money, um, like something like Alfred was run by a person or two, like that's a good business, right?\nBut when you're trying to make billions of dollars or or many millions of dollars with these things, yes, it becomes very hard to squeeze money out of us obnoxious software developers who consider ourselves power users, you know.\nSo, it's a little worrisome, and certainly I think that's why Arc is no longer around.\nYeah.\nIn basically, it has not seen updates in a while.\nIt like hardly hardly works.\nThey just released, as of the day we're recording this, an article or a post explaining the whole transition and everything like that.\nAnd this quote I thought really resonated with your point, which was, \"D1 retention was strong.\nThose who stuck around after a few days were fanatics.\nThat's me.\nBut our metrics were more like a highly specialized professional tool like a video editor than a mass market consumer product, which we aspired to be closer to.\"\nAnd I do think that comes down to, you know, dollar dollar bills, y'all.\nI think that's what that comes down to.\nUm, they aspire to be closer to a mass market computer product because like to make any kind of real money off of a specialized professional tool.\nVideo editors cost 500 bucks, 400 bucks for good ones, whatever.\nEven more than that if you're talking like Avid or something like that.\nSo, they're not making any cash on this if they release it with a, you know, $9 a month subscription, which who knows if people will even want to do that.\nSo, I don't know if Dia is a play to make money, but I think it's a play to get more adoption.\nIt feels weird, but I hope to get access to it.\nAnyways, I talked to Josh, um, the CEO of browser company, and they're hoping to come on the show, or we're hoping to have them on the show, so would be great.\nUh, we could talk hear about it.\nI also think that like what uh what browser somebody uses in the next two years is going to be very heavily pushed.\nThese like I think open AI is going to release a browser.\nThat was my that was my prediction for this year, just like like the browser is going to be the entry point for a lot of these things.\nThe OS is the entry point, which is why Apple has such a leg up, and I think Google will have such a leg up as well.\nBut if they can get you into their browser, like that's your entry point.\nUm, so you got to think they're like, well, someone's going to want to buy a browser that doesn't have one yet.\nAnd uh, you know, like when's Claude going to going to does Claude even Claude maybe even has their own browser yet?\nUh, they have an app, but you know that app could probably become a browser.\nI think you're totally right.\nThe moment that you said like that, I'm just thinking like, yes, the the open AI browser is going to exist at some point, and the way that we browse the web is going to change, and the and the browser company folks are betting on that, and I do think they will probably be first to market with what is this agentic type of actual browser.\nNow, there's other people who are doing this type of thing, but it is built into the the core of it.\nI mean, it is like they're not strapping something on the side of it and calling it a day.\nSo, it'll be interesting.\nYou know, whatever perplexity type of deal ends up being how we browse the web and navigates it for you.\nI would look forward to it when it can do things like I mean, you can probably do this right now.\nUm, but I just want to be like, \"Hey, collect all my expense receipts and submit them.\nPlease, I don't want to do that right now.\nYeah.\nOr watch me.\nI've done this 37 times in the past.\nNow do that for me.\"\nI know.\nIt's a race for those features and the bad people using those features to absolutely ruin the web, which is yes.\nWhich is kind of already happening, right?\nLike look at my email.\nLook at the replies to all of my tweets.\nIt's half of them are just like AI bots that are are sending this garbage over, you know?\nImagine what's going to happen when you give that functionality to like a landscaper who wants to make a little bit more money and and needs to email a bunch of people.\nYou know, it's it's going to be bad.\nThose those landscapers, you got to watch them.\nWell, like I'm I'm just thinking like like the bad people are using the AI for bad stuff right now, but like what happens when you give those tools to just regular people?\nYou know, it's going to it's going to get out of control.\nWord.\nUm, let's talk about Gecko.\nGecko, that's the engine behind Firefox.\nFirefox is the last couple years has been rather sluggish with their development, which is really frustrating.\nIt's just uh Firefox received most of its money from Google by people using Firefox, searching on Google, clicking on ads, and now people doing less of that, using Firefox less means that they have less money to actually put towards the development, which absolutely kills me because Firefox has always been that like sort of hold out, which is not a mega corporation developing a browser.\nAnd uh it they're still chugging along.\nThey just they just shipped Temporal, which is the very first browser to ship support for it, which is huge.\nUm, I really hope somebody comes along and like uses Firefox, like maybe OpenAI.\nImagine they choose to use Firefox.\nThat would be amazing for the development of it.\nYeah, it would be.\nAnd uh I Yeah, I don't know.\nYou know, to me, Firefox has a number of of issues or at least the rendering engine.\nOne of which is it is like relatively slow compared to all of them.\nGranted, it uses less RAM, so you you you know, it's slower but uses less resources.\nOkay.\nAnd honestly, are you going to notice that slowness in in action?\nI don't know.\nUm, there's also another browser that has been getting, I don't know, you could say nerd nerd kind of uh press lately, and I would say people act like this again, like this is like Firefox.\nPeople act like everybody uses this browser, but uh I would say not many people do.\nIt's called Zen, and Zen is a Firefox-based Arc alternative.\nAnd the thing that I don't understand about the people who like Zen as an alternative to Arc is that to me Arc is like what if we just slapped the Arc theme on Firefox, and that's fine, but it's not Arc, and it doesn't replicate the features of Arc.\nSo for me it's like if I if I just want that coat of paint, then I I don't know how you know I don't need the coat of paint.\nI I want the full feature set.\nSo maybe eventually it'll get there.\nBut yeah, Zen is is kind of like what if we took Arc look, and um put it onto Firefox.\nOh yeah.\nAnd there's no there's no mobile app either.\nLike I can't use a browser that doesn't sync my history to my phone because then you're like, \"Oh, what was that?\"\nOr if you need to open something quickly on your phone, you should be able to just go there immediately.\nSo yeah.\nYeah, that's where it's at.\nI I haven't used Firefox in a number of years, but I do keep it open for testing.\nI It exists on my computer for testing.\nUh so there you go.\nWebKit.\nNext one.\nVery well used.\nUm anytime I talk about Safari, everyone's like, \"Who uses Safari?\"\nLike literally half the world, it it's the only browser that runs on iOS.\nAlthough I guess like whatever happened to that the in the Europe they mandated that you they can run multiple browsers, not just and a lot of people don't seem to know this, but if you install Chrome or Edge or whatever on iOS, it uses the Safari engine, right?\nIt it's still it's not actually rendering it with the Chrome engine or the the Edge engine.\nIt.\nIt's literally using Safari web views inside of it.\nExcept in Europe, they ruled maybe 6 months ago that you must be able to to use it.\nAnd there was a huge list of different browsers that have I there's like 40 or 50 browsers, which blew my mind.\nA lot of them are just like like corporate VPN browsers that you must use because of your job, but I was kind of hoping that we would start to see newer browsers pop up with different rendering engines on Safari.\nI haven't seen too much yet.\nLet us know, European users, if you can close all those cookie banners, if you can uh find out if if that's if that's been shipped yet.\nBut I know I do see an article from October saying there are still no custom engines other than WebKit on iOS, but like like in existence.\nNot that they can't do it.\nI don't know what the status is there.\nI think it's a big a big lift um to be able to do that.\nAnd again, at the end of the day, most users don't necessarily care what engine is actually running.\nWe care as web developers because we care a lot about the feature set and the performance and things like that, but most people just want to know that my password is saved in there or or something similar to that.\nUm, but anytime we talk about Safari, people give us all kinds of crap because it's it's Apple and they love to uh love to hold back features from you.\nApple's been cranking on they've been first to a lot of the new CSS features.\nUm, they've been cranking on a lot of the JavaScript features.\nThey do approach a lot of specifically a lot of their APIs around progressive web apps.\nThey pro they approach it in an alternative way, which is very frustrating.\nYes.\nUm but what are some of the other APIs that were frustrating?\nYeah, it's mostly PWA stuff, but like you know the web MIDI API, they don't support that for um absolutely no good reason.\nThey they would say it's a good reason, but it's not a good reason, which is like many of the the Apple things is that they either just don't talk about it or they give you a bad reason and say that this is this is a reasonable argument for this why we we can't have this.\nOh, we can't simply vet all of the devices you could possibly plug into your computer.\nSo therefore, no MIDI for you.\nI don't it's it's dumb.\nIt's weird.\nI will say there's one like I Safari is the fastest browser hands down.\nIt's wonderful in many ways.\nI've tried moving to Safari so many times, but there's one massive bug in Safari that I don't understand how nobody else experiences.\nThe longer that you use Safari, you end up getting like a latency from when you can start typing in the search bar.\nSo, if you use it for the first time, second time, whatever, it's fine.\nBut if you use it for a few months, when you start typing into the search bar, there is an inherent latency that pops up, and it is enough to drive me absolutely nuts.\nBut other than that, once you're using the browser, it's very fast.\nAnd uh I think Safari gets more uh than it deserves, but at the same time, like Safari to me is a better experience than Firefox.\nI'm sorry, folks, but at the same time, there's a number of things holding it back from me wanting to use it full-time.\nThe biggest one for me in Safari, the reason why I can't use it full-time is the developer tools are bad.\nUh and I they've never gotten any better.\nThey're they're just kind of where they're at and they've been up the same.\nI I think everything is kind of wonky and weird in them.\nUm finding things is odd.\nCookie storage is weird.\nUh they've like locked down cookie storage so it has to be on a secure port.\nSo you can't you can't do like HTTP only cookies the same way that you can using local host on Safari.\nIt's like\nYeah, that's that's really frustrating.\nLike I have a local setup for using Caddy server which gives me like a local HTTPS, and it works in all the browsers except Safari, and when if in order to make it work on Safari, I have to like set up some custom host names in my etc host file.\nYes, but that's just a weird thing.\nThe dev tools really frustrate me in Safari.\nI don't know how any anyone can use that full time.\nUm they feel like dated, and they just don't feel as like smooth um to use, and I can find exactly what I'm looking for.\nLike I can jump between the dev tools of Edge and Chrome.\nObviously they're similar.\nUm not exactly similar though, and and Firefox, no problem.\nBut like whenever I'm looking for something in Safari, it's very very frustrating, and I can't exactly find what I want, and the autocomplete is not as good.\nBut the remote debugging, if you've like got an issue on iOS and you want to like debug it, it's very good.\nOnce you plug in a cord once, it's wireless, and that that is a really good experience.\nI've been happy with that.\nYes.\nI just wish I could use Chrome's instead when I'm debugging apps.\nYou can now you can if you go in if you go into Chrome.\nYeah.\nAs of Chrome 115, you can enable Safari web inspector for Oh, no.\nI'm wrong.\nI'm wrong.\nSorry.\nThis is you can use the Safari dev tools to debug things that are running on Chrome on iOS.\nYou what you want is you want to be able to use the Chrome dev tools for a website that's running on Chrome on iOS, right?\nYes.\nYes.\nYeah.\nThat's so you can you can if you have an app like an app open in Chrome on iOS, you can debug them remotely, but like that's as good as just opening it in Safari and and debugging it.\nYou don't actually get to use the Chrome DevTools, which would be nice, but I I think the the protocol between Safari DevTools and Chrome DevTools is not the same protocol.\nSo, it's kind of hard to hard to do that.\nWe need Firebug again.\nYep.\nFirebug.\nAll right, last of the rendering engines is one that is not out yet.\nUm, but it has gotten a lot of attention for good reason.\nIt's called Ladybird.\nStarted as like a project.\nIt's a part of Serenity OS, which is like\n\n\nThis weird kind of Unix core looking OS.\nIt's, it's a, I don't, I don't, I don't know too much about that project to be honest, but the Ladybird, the, the whole Ladybird project is this open-source, um, nonprofit of a new rendering engine from literal scratch.\nThey are starting from fresh, building a rendering engine in the year of 2020, whatever this would be possible.\nYes.\nYes.\nUnbelievable.\nYes.\nAnd, and, and if you want to get an idea about just how, what, like, you wonder how do, how you know, why haven't we done this before?\nWell, it's like they've been working on this for years now, and they have a 2026 alpha release target.\nSo, it is a big old undertaking to do something like this.\nAnd I'm cautiously optimistic, but at the same time, it's like, all right, you release this browser rendering engine that finally catches up in 2026, and then what?\nYou're going to be constantly adding features at a breakneck speed like the big boys are, and you're doing so as a nonprofit, like, I mean, good luck, good luck.\nI, I am like, as a nerd, Ladybird for me, that sounds like a great time, that sounds like a great, great time, but I'm skeptical, I think.\nBut for me, this feels like rebuilding something in Rust, you know, where it's, it's not written in Rust, but like, my point is that somebody is building a new underlying, they're, they're building a JavaScript engine, a CSS rendering engine, HTML parser, they're, they're building it all, and like, how much better would that be?\nLike, it doesn't, it seems like a huge job, given that like these other browsers have been around for 20 plus years.\nYou have to support the entirety of HTML up to this point.\nIt feels like that feels very hard, but it seems like they're doing it.\nLike I follow the Andreas Clling on Twitter, and he's just posting like, \"Oh, now we can render Google Maps,\" and it's like, what?\nThat's, that's nuts that you can do that.\nAnd they're just re-implementing.\nThey take the spec, like there's these web platform tests, and they just take the spec and and try to implement all of the, the APIs.\nAnd that's huge.\nLike what happens if they actually finish it?\nCan they move?\nWell, maybe we should have them on because I do want to talk.\nCan you move so much faster when you don't have 20 years of baggage around how the rendering engine works?\nAnd like it probably doesn't have code to support the marquee tag.\nThe nice thing about HTML is that it's HTML you wrote 40 years ago or 30 years ago still renders today.\nBut what if you didn't have to support 30-year-old HTML?\nWould that, would you, is it faster?\nIt's, it's kind of exciting to me that that this guy's building this.\nI, is it, there's seven people working on it right now according to their, their site.\nI, I, we got to get somebody from Ladybird on, cuz I'm so curious about this thing.\nYou can build it yourself.\nSo, you can't download it currently, but you can build it.\nSo, if you can build it, you can try it out.\nUm, it says it's, you know, pre-alpha primarily for use in developers.\nI would imagine it's a not like a, I, I don't know.\nI, I don't want to say it'd be a rough experience right now, but I'm sure it's not like you're not setting up Chrome here.\nYou know, this is a no, a, a true, uh, raw project.\nI, I'm interested in, I'm very hopeful, but like cautious that this actually succeeds, cuz that's cool.\nYeah, that's some smart people building it, you know, like there's some crazy projects out there.\nLike I always think about ffmpeg, about like how much of the world runs on ffmpeg, like, you know, this low-level library that has just made so much of the world possible.\nYes.\nAnd, and Chrome has also done that.\nYou know, Firefox has, has done that.\nWebKit has done that.\nSo like what does this do to the world when they have a theoretically faster, more lightweight browser engine?\nYou know, like it's, there's lib Web rendering engine, lib.js is JavaScript engine, they have a WM engine, a whole media engine, core, like there's, there's quite a bit here.\nThere's a, there's a bit here.\nAnd I, I'm stoked.\nI said, I'm hopeful.\nCautiously stoked.\nCautiously stoked.\nThat's the best way.\nThis is, this is me about to drop in on a quarter pipe at the age of 40.\nUh, cautiously stoked.\nUm, usage statistics.\nLet's figure out what are, what are people actually using, both, I, I know that the in the real world, but like what are people actually using, visiting our sites and stuff like that.\nDo, do we have some stats ready for that?\nDo you want me to guess?\nDo you, do you have that available?\nYeah, let's, let's start by, by taking a look at just like the world, um, first.\nSo you guess if you're taking a look at, I'm using statcounter.com, the browser market share for April 2025 worldwide, uh, what do you think the usage is?\nTime has come to push that button on percentage wise, 22 for Firefox.\nOh, that was pretty close.\nWow.\n2.5% for Firefox.\nGood.\nWow.\nOkay.\nI have, I have a good reason why I know that, but because people are always like fire, and I'm like, it's 2.5 whatever percentage usage.\nOh yeah.\nYeah.\nSorry.\nBut hold on.\nIf you go, if you were to filter for US, how much do you think Firefox is?\nUh, for us?\nOh, that's a tougher question.\nYou think it would be higher or lower?\nI would say higher.\n4%.\nOkay.\nYeah.\n4.17%.\nAll right.\nBut tell me what do you think Edge, Safari, and Chrome split is?\nI don't know.\nEdge might be like, Edge might be like 12% or something.\nEdge is five.\n5%.\nOkay, that's extremely low to me, given that it comes surprising to me by default on Windows machines, you know, like most computers in the world.\nIs that, is that fair to say?\nMost computers in the world are, uh, I don't, yeah, I would assume still.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah, I, it does feel low.\nBut then you have mobile users, right?\nIs there an edge mobile?\nI mean, yes.\nActually, if you filter for desktop, Edge goes up to 13%.\nAlso shows that most people are not viewing the internet on a desktop computer.\nYou know, most people are consuming stuff through a mobile browser.\nI would say Safari is at like 40%.\nMaybe even higher.\nThis is very surprising.\nSafari is at 17%.\nOkay.\nGlobally on all platforms.\nBut if you were to go mobile, Safari only jumps up to 22%.\nWhich again, you think like iOS users.\nIf I were think of of people I know, I would say 90% of them have an iPhone.\nMaybe 95% of them.\nYes.\nAnd that's, and use Safari.\nBut like that's not the case for the world.\nYeah.\nI mean, the rest is, is Chrome mostly.\nI mean, you have obviously like Samsung and and those which are scraping it.\nThe reason why I knew Firefox is cuz I did this talk on like, uh, can you use it today, and if, if Firefox supported it, it would always jump up the percentage by like 2% global usage, but like not more than that.\nSo you'd be like, it's at, it's at like 95%, but you can't use it on Firefox.\nSo you know, yeah, that's a bummer.\nHey, like, Firefox has been like lagging on like, can some of the container query stuff, you know, and like you're almost at a point now where it's like, I, I'm not saying don't support it, but that sucks that for such a small percentage of your users, you have to do it.\nChrome 66% worldwide usage, which is absolutely massive.\nStill makes me feel good because like, as, as much as people don't want the big Google to to control everything, they're, they're one of the, the biggest engines.\nThey are the biggest engine right now.\nAnd if Chrome's market share starts to slip, um, that would really bum me out, what that would mean for some of the resources behind Chrome.\nEven already, we've, we've heard it, like Adam Argle got laid off of Chrome for seemingly no good reason other than just random reasons, which is such a bummer, you know, some of the top talent in web development right now no longer working there, and that makes me kind of scared for, for a future of one of the biggest browsers, browsers in general.\nYeah, I know, and as much as people like to rag on on Google, Chrome is the, the best, the best browser in any way.\nYes, it is a, it is a RAM hog.\nIf you have a lot of tabs open, just buy more RAM.\nJust buy more RAM.\nYes.\nGo to the RAM.\nGo to the app store and download more RAM.\nYes.\nUm, a funny story.\nUm, my, my one of, one of my good friends, he, it was like his girlfriend's birthday.\nThey'd been together for like 3 years or something.\nYou know, you're thinking like maybe a romantic gesture for a birthday present.\nHe got a RAM for her computer.\nOh my gosh.\nAnd she's like not techy at all.\nI just remember being like, \"What a move, man.\"\nAnd he was just like, \"She needed it.\nShe needed the RAM.\"\nThat's hilarious.\nShe's like, \"Great.\nThank you for the RAM.\"\nUh, yeah, that is not something you buy by your wife.\nYeah, that's super funny.\nUm, DevTools experience.\nWe've already kind of, um, we've already kind of gone over this, but give me your dev tools experience ranked.\nYeah, it goes Edge, Firefox, Chrome.\nI might even put Firefox first.\nThe dev tools are very good, and I think they look the best.\nI'm going to say again, Firefox definitely the best dev tools.\nThen Edge, then Chrome, then Safari at the end.\nEdge does a lot with the tabs.\nAnd they basically just like reskinned the, the tabs, you, and, and when you have multiple tabs at the top, they'll just show you the icon, which I really like.\nYou can put the tabs on the side if you want.\nIt just feels a little bit better.\nEvery now and then they freeze though, and I have to like delete my profile or something there.\nSo, there's something weird going on there.\nBut I did, I did, I was asking on Twitter how to like fix it, and somebody had a similar issue with Chrome.\nSo, uh, I don't, I think it's a lower level issue, but I've been, been a big fan of, uh, the Chrome Dev Tools, and they also added some like selector performance stuff to the dev tools.\nIt's now been upstreamed and it exists in, uh, in Chrome as well.\nBut at the time, if you wanted to see is this a slow selector?\nUm, because every time I use CSS has or like any sort of weird where is checkbox selector, you get a million people being like, that's slow, shouldn't use that.\nAnd my big thing is always tools over rules.\nYou know, measure it.\nIs it actually slow?\nMaybe.\nLet's, let's take a look at the, the stats there, Jonathan.\nYes.\nUh, or what is your JavaScript implementation faster?\nI don't think so, buddy.\nMaybe it is, but just test it.\nUm, yeah, for me, it's, it's Chrome, Firef or Chrome, Firefox, and Safari for me if I'm ranking them.\nI've never used Edge's dev tools.\nI don't know.\nYou got it.\nUh, yeah, every once in a while you got to smack it with a mallet, but they're wonderful.\nYes.\nNo, get, get off of Chrome.\nYou've used Chrome many times.\nYou know what it's like.\nYou got to either go full Brave or full Edge or Vivaldi, something else or Opera GX.\nCan you please use Opera GX for a week and report back?\nI tried using Opera for a week and I couldn't get through the week.\nSo I, I, it's not that Opera is bad.\nIt's just like, oh, there's just like, I don't know, there's nothing there.\nUm, sorry Opera people.\nIt's fine.\nUh, it's just like nothing to make me want to switch.\nMaybe Opera GX.\nMaybe I need some mindfulness, you know.\nUm, tab experience.\nFor me, I think that Arc has the best tab experience.\nSpecifically, you command T, it opens a command pallet.\nI start typing something, it opens the tab I already have open.\nSo, therefore, you're never like wondering what position the tab is at.\nYou don't even have to see the tabs to know that you have one open.\nI start typing, uh, you know, s y, and it opens up Syntax.\nIf I already have it open, it prevents you from opening a thousand tabs at once.\nThat automatically closes them after a certain amount of days so you don't end up with 10,000 tabs.\nSo for me, that experience is the best.\nAnd I do hope that Dia emulates that to some extent.\nIt doesn't look like they are right now, but I hope it does to some extent.\nYeah, I've never been a big like tab monster or whatever, you know, switching between them.\nI just, just use them.\nI, I aggressively close tabs.\nYou know, there's some people that like are like saving tabs as like bookmarks.\nMy wife is like that.\nShe'll have 300 tabs open, and she uses like, she opens a tab for every single tracking number that she has, and like she'll just go back to that tab to see.\nI'm like, there's apps that will like send you a notification when it's about to be delivered.\nBut she's a tab monster, and I just, I just close them all the time.\nEvery now and then if it's, if I'm too overwhelmed, close it all.\nYou know, I'll find it again if I need it.\nYeah, Arc does that, but in a graceful way, and like, yeah.\nYeah, it feels, it feels a little bit different, which is why I like that.\nUm, containers and profiles.\nI do still think that Arc takes this one because this little interface of just swiping between them is just such a good experience.\nUm, and what do you explain what you use containers and profiles for?\nUm, so like here's a good one.\nI have my personal stuff, which is all my own Google logins, all my own stuff, whether that is my own personal like Reddit or Twitter or Blue Sky or whatever, it's all in this one profile, and then I swipe, and then all of a sudden it's not only my bookmarks for all of these Syntax related and Sentry things, but everything is logged into, you know, my Sentry email address for all of my Google stuff, or even the Syntax Twitter social account.\nSo just with that like little swipe, I'm now able to be in an environment that is all logged into all of my work stuff, or swipe and all of my personal stuff, or swipe and, uh, you know, whatever.\nI, I have different ones set up.\nSo I have one for Sentry specific stuff, one for Syntax specific stuff, and one for personal specific stuff.\nAnd before in the past, I had them for level.\n\n\nUp tutorials or whatever.\n\nOh yeah, I used to love the profiles in Firefox because you could have multiple tabs open.\nSo I could have like the Syntax stuff open, and then I could in the next tab, I could have my own personal stuff open, and it was all in a single tab, and they were color-coded.\nYou could group them together.\nNow on Edge, you have to use their like their profiles.\nAnd I basically have a Syntax profile, and I have my own personal profile, and then I have like a couple others for development and whatnot.\nEspecially like whenever I do like the saved credit card testing and whatnot.\nI like having a separate profile for that so it's not actually messing with my actual stuff.\nBut it's it sucks because you have to like reinstall all the same extensions for every single profile, and like you got to turn off all the like Microsoft Edge stuff that I talked about earlier again for the same profile, and like it's another window that you have to have open.\nSo I do not like the Edge profiles.\nI really wish I could go back to maybe I'll go back to Firefox.\nIt's so hard cuz I I do so many videos on like the like nextgen stuff like and whatever.\nAnd the reason why I initially left Firefox is I was just getting weird slowness and blank white screens and I was just fed up with it.\nBut I also like to be able to try out new APIs without switching my browser.\n\nCool.\nUm do you have anything else on these browsers here?\nThere's a lot of browsers.\nWhat's your favorite browser, folks?\nDo you believe that the statistics are wrong and more people are actually using Firefox?\nUh just let us know.\nWhat do you think?\nWhat's the browser of the future?\nDo you think that AI browsing experiences and agentic flows for browsers will in fact take over?\nWhat will that look like?\nWhich browser will show up and kick everybody's ass?\nIs Ladybird going to succeed and all of that stuff?\nI want to know what you think about the browser landscape.\nWhat do you use?\nWhat do you hate?\nAll that good stuff.\nAs always, catch you in the next one.\nPeace.\n",
