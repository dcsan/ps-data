  "cleanText": "Hey everyone, before we get in real quick, this is an episode with the head of engineering at Superhuman, and we recorded this before the news of Superhuman was acquired by Grammarly, which is absolutely wild. Um, we did not know that this was going to happen, and I don't think that it changes any of the conversations, cuz we are talking about uh development methodology, CSS, um, their engineering philosophy and and how they make everything fast. Tons of local first stuff. Um, but I just wanted to tell you because there's probably a couple keyboard warriors already in the comments being like, \"This is a sponsored episode.\" We would never do that to you. It's not sponsored at all. We've been trying to get somebody from Superhuman on for months now, and it just so happened to line up. So, enjoy the episode. Welcome to Syntax. Today, we have a really great one. We're going to be talking about one of the most performant and excellent apps that I use in my day-to-day, every single day. We have an amazing guest on the show with us. We have Loïc Houssier.\nOh, I butchered it. We We cut to me because I can at least French Canadian accent it. But first name was perfect. First name was perfect.\nYou got it right, Scott. Thanks.\nLucier. And we're going to be talking all about how the heck this thing is so good. You know, it's got an army of super fans. And uh I was kind of one of those people who saw a lot of people talking about Superhuman being so good and was like, \"How can it be better than an email app that I'm using today? Email apps are all the same.\" And then I um I bit the bullet. I signed up and I regret doing that because it's now ruined a lot of software for me. It is so so wonderful in many ways. So we're going to be talking all about that. Loïc, welcome to the show.\nThank you. Thanks for having me, guys. I mean I listened to some of you on how previous show and it was like super interesting to I would say to listen to it and uh I feel humbled like now to be like joining you there and maybe like sharing some of my I would say perspective or like experiences if I can provide some some good content. So we'll see we'll see about that.\nYeah because I mean you've been you've been you know around a long time. You were a DocuSign for a while before, right? And that's like a massively used app. So uh you're no stranger to high performing uh applications on the web, right?\nYeah, I mean I've been around like I have some gray hair and it shows. So So yes, I've been around and I've been uh both in like a massive companies earlier in my career in France like big corp uh type of companies. I've been in small companies through acquisition. I joined DocuSign. So where we had like the scaleup IPO trajectory just before COVID when it was a bit a bit crazy. So there's some fun stories about it. But then I decided to move back to like smaller companies, small startups usually in a remote setup uh remote and hybrid uh and distributed which had some complexity but uh also like more fun and just joined Superhuman six months ago. So pretty cool.\nYeah. So yeah. Do you want to tell us a little bit about Yeah. a little bit about maybe Superhuman as what it is and then also what you're doing on Superhuman.\nYeah, I mean I I was like you like I was not using the the product before uh getting in touch with with the team and I was like how come I would pay for something that is free like I'm using Gmail, I'm a Gmail power user, I like all my setup is done there, like all my filters and all. So I felt productive uh I felt productive and then I tried the product during like uh when I was chatting with like their teams and before joining and I was like yeah it's nice, it's beautiful, it's fast. Now the question is like okay, it's better, but like would I pay 30, 40 bucks a month to get I would say that amount of better? So I was like not sure, not sure and we keep talking and I I love the people, I love their perspective, I love like the the vision they had about like how the craft should be done and how delight can uh basically create a business and after three weeks they have this wonderful PLG motion like product like growth motion and they kind of like trick you into using the keyboard shortcuts. So, like the education in product was really good. And after three weeks, I was like, \"Holy cow, this is fast. There's no freaking way I can go back to Gmail.\" And I was like, \"Okay, I need to understand how they do this. I need to understand how they basically make me happy to pay 40 bucks a month uh like for something where the competition is basically free and and it's super interesting. So I joined six months ago uh there and with a sort of like a mandate uh like when you come as a CTO or as a VP there's always some sort of like a mandate and and my goal was to uh and the goal is to help the team embrace uh like this new paradigm like with AI and how you bring like AI into basically a craft oriented organization uh where speed of execution was maybe not the first focus because the perceived quality was way more important and how do you balance that more? How do you use AI basically to get that productivity gain while still maintaining the bar super high. So that's that's what I joined and that's what I'm trying to uh I would say to help the team I would say get better with.\nAre you talking like adding AI features to the product or you're talking engineers using AI to build the product or both? Uh it's a great question because both, that's that's both because as like every people that are like focused on the craft you have your own set of tools like you have your flow as an engineer and you tweaked it to to be like feel great in your flow and AI is coming here is like kind of like redefining what even the flow is and uh so that's that's one aspect. The other aspect is we are a highly qualitative product and all the quality just depended on us like on engineers, on quality and like all the work that you're doing and all of a sudden with LLMs coming, some of your features, the quality like garbage in, garbage out depends on the user now. How do you control the perception of the user so that when the result is not up to their bar, they understand that they are doing something wrong and you help them like increase or improve their prompting capabilities uh when when needed? So like both aspect are really key for our success given our level of expectations, like our users, they don't accept okay.\nwhich is probably the biggest change for me\nwell let's talk about that like when you when you talk about like this like top tier software that is expensive but worth it, you know, you always think about like like Panic, big iOS and and iOS applications, they produce really nice stuff and almost always when it's this like high quality software, it's always native, but Superhuman is not native, is it?\nIt is.\nIt is.\nIt is on mobile and uh for desktop we have basically an electron app, but like everything like the web app and the desktop app basically share like 90% of the code which interesting using like a bunch of the browser capacity for everything that is storage and everything because we're offline first. uh and we might talk about it uh because that was like one of the design choices because we have this 100 millisecond rule for every interaction in the product and you have to be like intentional about it.\nHow many milliseconds?\n100 milliseconds. We're targeting 50 uh but like an interaction that is taking more than 100 milliseconds is considered bad or poor quality.\nMhm. And it shows when you use the app. I mean, especially because so much of the general workflow for people who might not know it is via like keyboard shortcuts. So when you're using and you you really get the keyboard shortcuts, if it's not feeling that fast, I mean, you're going to notice it right away. So you're saying the iOS app is native, but the desktop app is Electron.\nYeah.\nAnd what's the what's the UI done with?\nUh React.\nReact.\nIt's basic mostly React. Uh interestingly, we don't use just yet any design system. So everything is bespoke mostly because we have an emphasize on local optimum uh when it comes to the user interaction. You want everything to feel great and to do that sometimes uh with design system uh you're somewhat limited. Um so for quite a long time like everything was bespoke in every single pieces of the of the product.\nWow.\nBut yeah that's that's intense. And how do you maintain consistency then if you have no design system?\nYou need a bunch of senior people. You need to hire engineers that are product/design engineers. So you need people that just have an eye for something that feels off and that can like make it right. So we are very intentional in the people that we hire. We don't hire like software engineers. I mean it's kind of like a a caric catcher to say that we hire like product engineers. Everyone is saying they they hire like product engineers, but a good portion of our interview process is focused on especially for the front end people uh is like focused on your ability to to craft like a great user experience. So we just don't want like people that are great at like whatever the frameworks or all of that but like very CSS oriented, very like detail oriented. So yeah, you you have to you have to be intentional when you hire and we have a lot of like internal trainings I would say coming back and recurring about like all the engineering principles that we need to apply in the in the way we work.\nMan that's wild to know. I it's interesting too especially because I would have thought you know some of the other apps that we've used that have um like a electronbased desktop app that you would use also something similar for their their mobile app. And the mobile app does feel like it could be very much the same UI code base or anything like that. That's interesting to know that it's it's different. Also like I have found that Superhuman looks different than many apps that I use. It doesn't have that same kind of like generic looking uh style to it. So I would imagine that that designer kind of product developer fits with that as well. and and those type of product developers they're they're focused specifically on speed as well or is the speed aspect of it like an entirely separate team?\nNo, no, no. Speed is not a team. Speed is like I would say part of the quality process. So everyone is looking at speed as something that is mandatory as part of the user experience. So it's not an afterthought and and Mike our chief architect would basically say that speed needs to be like the first thing you think about rather than the last thing you think about. Like if you think about like building a feature, you need to understand how this would be fast while you're designing uh the the application and that's why we moved to like offline first. It's not because we wanted to support offline. It's because the number one culprit when it comes to like slowness is the network. Especially when you're talking emails and you're on your mobile phone, you have a shitty network. Like you don't want this to be felt uh on the end users side of things. So we do a lot locally. We do a lot. So it might surprise you but for example there's a database on your I would say iPhone mobile app. We are not getting the data live. We basically like sync the last 30 days and moving onwards. So we have a huge footprint on your phone so that everything like search can work offline and be like crazy fast. We don't rely on the provider surf like Gmail or Outlook for example only for stuff that are like back in history. But like the last days it will feel like instantaneous because it's local.\nYeah. I I've been getting into a lot of local data stuff myself and sync engines and CRDTs and and those types of things. Can you can you maybe like talk a little bit about the tech behind what local database you are using and how the sync process works? Yeah.\nSo take everything with a grain of salt. I'm the VP. I'm not the engineer neither the chief architect. Uh but uh so right now we are on mobile we are using Realm uh but like we are moving away and uh we are like at the decision process to understand which tech we will uh use globally. It's kind of like a SQLite uh approach. I remember Realm. Yeah.\nOn the browser side, same. Uh so we use an extension. So we have an extension that is uh that is used both by the electron app and the the mobile the the web experience and we store like we use the browser APIs and everything to basically store locally and uh we use some version of SQLite as well to store stuff. uh we store basically emails, we store your um events, agenda, the calendaring like everything like this uh is locally stored uh but it's stored like as um we store the emails but like we have like of course some backend capacity where we store more stuff uh more history for example but also like everything that is needed for rag systems where we have like a dedicated vector database which is not local so we don't do AI locally on device just yet. So when you're offline, you don't have AI and uh that's a that's a design choice for now. Maybe it will change eventually. Uh but right now we are sticking with it. And why why is that is because like\nI've I've been talking to a lot of people who are starting to do especially as the processors get faster in these phones and and we have web GPU and whatnot where you're able to do embeddings like fairly fast on device. What's the choice for not doing that vector search and embeddings on device right now?\nBecause usually we do the vector search to do something. It's like the vector search is only one piece of the feature that you want to to provide. So I will give you some example but we do some um draft creation uh for you. Uh so funny enough Superhuman moved from being the fastest email app to the most productive email app. And part of the productivity is creating for you drafts that are ready to be sent. Like you don't have even have to think about it. Someone ask you a question, we look at your I would say capacity and we provide some answers that hopefully are 90% of the time right and you just have to hit send boom you're done. Uh typical use case as well is like you ask a question to someone and you have like some sort of like a reminder that is ready so that you can nudge people pretty fast uh without thinking about it. And to do this we need some tones. we need some um information about like the past emails that you send to those people and you need to process the email and everything that is generative on device is still relatively slow right now. So the experience wouldn't be great. So the question is like are we okay with somewhat a like a slow like generative feature that would make you wait or\n\n\nWe just don't allow it at all?\nAnd coming back to our principles, okay, is not good enough.\nSo this is like typically the case where devices and models like running on device are not good enough just yet for our quality bar.\nSo, and that's tough because we could, I would say, implement something, uh, but like our user base, like they need something that is clean and well done.\nMhm.\nSo you have always to ask your question, is it good enough for them, given the past of quality and delight that we are providing for every feature?\nYeah.\nAnd as far as AI features go, like, and you mentioned, you know, speed being a highest priority, and I know that like AI isn't always seen as being like the fastest, um, thing.\nYou know, you're waiting for a response, streaming in, etc.\nBut like, what kind of AI features does Superhuman implement or can they implement that don't need to feel like instantaneously fast, like async kind of features?\nYeah.\nSo, so that's one point, like we do it, I think, so that it's ready when I would say you open the UI, I would say your Superhuman app.\nSo I was mentioning those, uh, drafts or like the classification of your email, everything is happening on our back end, and when we open the, you open the app, all your emails are filtered automatically and the drafts are created.\nSo we try to optimize for those processing that can happen basically before you open the, uh, the app.\nMost of the features are like this.\nWe still have some features like augmented writing, like you want to kind of like rewrite, uh, like an email because you don't feel right about it, like you don't want to go to CHP and everything.\nSo like, come on, CJ, and improve writing, boom, and you have like this being processed, and then it's kind of like using some UX tweaks to make it feel that it's instantaneous.\nSo you cannot just wait with like a spinner saying like, hey, uh, reviewing your comment.\nSo for example, like if you compare to Notion AI, if you're using Notion AI to rewrite some content, it will feel relatively slow.\nThey will basically strike through stuff, so they add some complexity to the user experience, showing they do something, and eventually you accept the modification.\nWe don't do that.\nLike we basically like write, and basically like the streaming APIs are good enough to make things like feel fast, basically.\nIt's writing faster that you can read, uh, so you don't need those extra stuff and those extra things that Notion is doing, for example.\nSo we try to get rid of the clutter so that the experience feels like, uh, really fast on there.\nWow.\nYeah.\nI, I, I just popped open my little latest updates thing because it feels like there's always like new updates.\nSo you all are shipping a lot of things really fast, which on the surface level, when you look at Superhuman, it and UI is not like changing substantially all the time, or it doesn't feel like a different app, but here's just like four new features I didn't even know about.\nSo like, how is your team able to ship so much so quickly?\nWe are a startup and we work hard.\nUh, so that's, I mean, honestly, that's that's a part of it, like we work hard, and I mean, I have freaking good engineers to be fair.\nUm, most of the team, like the average tenure is probably around like three years on average, uh, with people up to like six to seven years.\nSo we have a bunch of seniority and knowledge, uh, that is already in the team, which helps.\nWe are pretty intentional, uh, and we try to prepare things so that when we work on things on features, they are baked, uh, already to some extent, so that we can keep the flow going.\nWe put in place an organization that is pretty domain centric.\nSo we have three big domains in Superhuman: the calendar experience, which is a new one; the triage experience.\nSo we have a team dedicated on the, um, like the focus that you need to get when you join, like for example, you go to Gmail, you have a long list of emails in front of the mess, you have the cognitive load, you need to go, you need to go through it.\nSo we have a bunch of features like splits or like automatic archiving of like the clutter so that you can just focus on the right thing.\nSo we have a team dedicated to it, and we have a team dedicated with engaging with your emails where this forwarding, commenting, uh, responding, uh, basically.\nSo those are the three teams, and when you have teams that are like laser focused on their persona, the way they use it, um, the the complaint that they have, it's easier to get velocity because you know your stack, you know your codebase, you know the complaints, you know like the how people are using it.\nUh, it makes things, I would say, faster, and to be fair, AI is helping a lot.\nAnecdotal feedback, uh, like it's based on like self, uh, uh, like we did a survey and people were like providing like their own appreciation of like the productivity gain they get from AI.\nThe answers were roughly between 20 and 30% productivity gain, so it's not doubling our capacity just yet, uh, but like it's significant, it's significant.\nI want to talk a little bit about just like email overload and being able to find what is important because this is something I think a lot about right now is that tools like Superhuman allow you to just send a whole lot more email than you normally would because it, it will, you said it'll generate drafts, right?\nAnd so there's, there's like this new area of it's not necessarily spam, but it's just like this like generated cold outreach that I get.\nI probably got 15 already this morning, and I'm, I'm, I'm kind of at my wit's end with my email right now.\nI'm just, I'm sick of it because it's, it's so hard to find what is important.\nSo, I'm curious, like, like, do you have any thoughts about how email in the future is going to look, both from sending lots more because it's good for business, but then on the inbound having to be offensive and try filter for filter all this crap out?\nNo, no, no.\nI mean, this is this is a good point, like the one thing that was interesting, like before talking about the future of emails, like if you look back what was the past of email, like everyone is like our customer base, like 90% of our users are using Gmail and the enterprise customers are on Outlook, uh, roughly, so that's kind of like the 90/10 is like the the way we think about it, like think about Gmail, uh, Gmail has like no interest in getting rid of the spam or like the marketing spam.\nMhm.\nBecause of course Gmail is a marketing engine and Google is a marketing engine, and that's why say they're kind of like bread and butter.\nSo they cannot just help you only receive what makes sense for you.\nLike they need that volume of data.\nWe don't care because that's not our pricing strategy.\nThat's not the way we make money, and and that's coming like today, like this is what you have right now.\nWe, uh, and especially using AI, it's so much easier to detect whether an email is a pitch, like a company reaching out to you to sell you like the new CI/CD tool that they've been working, they're out of YC, whatever, and they want to pitch you, or like those marketing emails because you use, um, GitHub or GitLab on a daily basis.\nThey send you like some marketing content associated with like the new features and all of that.\nUm, yeah, pardon my French.\nThat close.\nThat close.\nBut we all get like all those emails, and and honestly, to be efficient and, um, especially when you're a sea level, there's some stuff that are really crazy important, and that clutter that you would love to get rid of.\nAnd now we get rid of it.\nLike our users, like everything that is marked as a pitch or marked as marketing email, you can select autoarchive it.\nSo you don't even see it.\nIt's not even showing up in your in your email.\nAnd then you can do some, uh, pretty like nice thing, like you can prompt the classification.\nYou can say like, oh, you know what, everything that is like podcast related or everything that is, um, coming from my board, like as wide as this, and my board are like people like this and this and this.\nSo you can write prompts now in Superhuman to classify your email so that you can say this is important, this is important, and and it's working great, it's working great.\nSo that's that's kind of like one way, but the same, like you can expect those marketing people, I would say, to build some outreach, like hidden text that will try to mess up with the LLM that is doing the classification, like it would be kind of like the the typical spam anti-PAM, uh, war.\nAnd it's just like the the weapons are different right now.\nBut it it would be\nYeah.\nLike we get people now, they will ingest the transcript from the last six episodes, and then they will say something like, \"Oh, I also live in Denver to Scott,\" and they'll they'll try to make it as personal, you know, or they'll ingest like three episodes and 10 of my last Instagram stories, and like they'll, it's it's awful how personal they're trying to make it, you know?\nAnd now I'm trying to write, I use I use Missive, and I'm trying to write these like AI rules that I'm on the offense of it, and it's just a waste of my time.\nGive it a try.\nGive it a try and let me, let me know, let me know how it works.\nI have found the the labels, the auto labels to be super useful.\nI, I, I posted one in our show notes so Wes could see, just like labeling a pitch that somebody had, uh, sent me, and it clearly labeled as pitch.\nI didn't know you could set up your own custom auto labels though.\nI haven't done any of that yet.\nAnd search with AI as well, you know.\nShow me the emails that I don't know, six months ago, somebody emailed me requesting a print of a sticker, you know.\nI, I hate having to like try to hit all the keywords properly.\nI use I use this AI search like almost on a daily basis, uh, because like a lot of my knowledge and content is in my email.\nThe last example over the weekend, I was working on my citizenship application, and for the people that are going through this, like in the US, you need to go through the last five years of travels, uh, outside of the US, and I was like, oh, damn, I remember like I went to Japan, I don't remember the dates.\nHey, can you find the tickets, uh, like for my trip in Japan that I believe happened in around that timeline, boom, boom, boom, and I, I get those emails and I have the dates and done, like I was done with.\nSo this is like city examples.\nUh, but, uh, like AI search is definitely something that is, um, I would say, crazy good.\nThe the next piece that will be like very interesting and probably will ship that early Q3 is like someone asking like a friend of you already in your, like, I would say, in your list of contact and all of that, asking for like a slot and like, hey, can we meet somewhere next week, please?\nWe have access to your calendar.\nWe have access to your availability.\nSo we can autodraft an answer and propose like a slot or a set of slots that are working for you, and then you just have to basically hit send and boom, you're done.\nSo a lot of stuff like this now are possible because of LLMs that used to be like just impossible to do before.\nAnd if you want to see all of the errors in your application, you'll want to check out Sentry.io.\nYeah, I was wondering about, I even had on my question list, given that there is like, there is a calendar integration and it does seem to be getting more and more.\nI haven't found it to be able to actually replace my full on calendar just yet, but like the fact that you have so much information.\nOne of the things Superhuman does already really well is contextually aware things.\nSo Wes, you might not know about this, but somebody in an email will say like, currently this is the way they currently work.\nThey'll be like, \"What do you think about Wednesday?\"\nWhen you open that email, it will actually pop open the calendar and show you Wednesday already.\nSo, you can see exactly what your calendar's like on Wednesday.\nAnd I use that obviously all the time.\nHow do those type of features work?\nIs it just simply like looking for certain strings and then, uh, choosing what to do with them?\nYeah, totally.\nThis is the type of features that might feel overkill for like a typical B2B SAS company.\nThey would be like, nah, let's not do like a feature like this, like people can click on the calendar and go to the, like they can do it, there's a way, and this is where like we have a co-founder that is a kind of like an art director to some extent and has like a product test and understand what are the features that will create delight, uh, in the end user, and this is typically one, you open this calendar and boom, we can, we see there's a date, and it's not that complex to find a date like in in a text, and boom, you open like the, I would say, the right sidebar, and it's probably working like 95% of the time, but it's just delightful because you, you feel you're in the context, and this is something that is really important, like you were mentioning the fact that we have a lot of features, but we are not cluttering the experience, like the experience still looks sleek, there's not a lot of buttons, like we're not adding like a new button, like every time there's a new feature, we want this to be discoverable, but hidden, uh, I would say first, so you need to kind of like learn to use them so that the experience always feels slick and like the, you always like in the focus mode, that's something that is part of our like design principles.\nThat parsing of the date, is that done like programmatically or is that done with like a model?\nNo, it's not a model.\nUh, it's programmatically done.\nSo this is typically the a place where like, uh, with the right rag apps and everything, like token detection and all of that, there's a bunch of libraries that can do this.\nHonestly, I would need to check like which one we're using, uh, and I can like provide that after the show.\nNo, clearly this is this is doable without, uh, without LLMs.\nYeah, which is so nice because, yeah, it that allows it to be fast.\nIt allows it to just happen.\nBut like as you, it's funny that you said delight, obviously, because that seems like really what it is.\nBut the first time it happened to me, that was the discovery moment when you open an email, all a sudden my calendar is open and I'm like, whoa.\nOh, this is, uh, this is it's a delightful experience.\nI get, I know you've only been there six months, but how, how do those types of experiences even like, how, how do those types of ideas even come to people?\nBecause\nNo, it comes down, it comes down to the product taste.\nSo I think product taste is something that you need someone to teach you, uh, to some extent, and, uh, Rahul is probably the person that has the most impressive product taste.\nSo like he's doing every single product reviews and design reviews in the company.\nKind of like the Brian Shepsky of the world at Airbnb.\nLike it's kind of like a version of that.\nI, I don't want to enter like the founder mode like discussion, like\n\n\nHe's a really great founder that we have, and we love him, but he has that, he always asks those questions. He always tries to understand like, how far are you from getting to that wow moment? Like, how many steps to it? And I've been here like only six months, and now I'm asking those questions. Now I'm looking at the demo that my teams are doing. I'm like, feels clunky, doesn't feel Superhuman, feels too complex.\n\nWe need to do something like this. So it's kind of like trained to some extent by being exposed to Rahul that has that, uh, as a, I don't know if he learned it. It's a gift. But it's different. It's a gift. I think it is. I think it is. But like the same way I would say when you work with someone that is just great, uh, and you get mentored and you see how they operate, you start to build a muscle, and you start to build, I would say, that taste. It's kind of like drinking wine. Like, uh, you drink like shitty wine at first. You start to have like a better taste about it. And you meet someone that is just like great at explaining why it feels better, and you're like, \"Ah, you're right. I see the fruit now. I, or like, I can feel the hook now.\" You tell it. And then you build on it, and you become like more expert. But you need that first person to sort of like open your mind about those like different aspects, and and that's a big part of it.\n\nHere's a product question. Will there ever be a true dark mode? Yeah, the dark mode, Wes, is one of the disappointingly, uh, light gray dark modes in my mind. Uh, so we call it carbon. We call it carbon. Uh, but like, I'm a dark mode user, and I'm complaining every freaking day. I think that's the only thing I've ever submitted to feedback in the app was, can you get a real dark mode here?\n\nNo, no, no. So that's, that's very true. Like, it was like mostly like, uh, I would say made for like white and clear like mode for like a long time, and then we basically implemented a dark mode because of the request, but we didn't do it everywhere. And as we are not heavy on design systems, making those changes, like, I would say, takes time, and we are, we want to optimize locally. So like, every single interaction needs to be thought through with dark mode now, uh, like in, in mind. But no, I'm with you. I'm with you. And you know what? Even worse, I'm an Android users user, and Android is lagging behind iOS. So like, for my team, I complain about like the two things that are lagging. So yeah, it's, it's really bad. It's really bad. I, I've noticed that, you know, the two main ways that you interact with Superhuman are through the command pallet and keyboard shortcuts, which are, Wes, most of the keyboard shortcuts are just like one character. So like, you know, E or enter, you know, those types of things, right? Like I hit E and it immediately marks an email is done. And you kind of J and K, you kind of really get used to using the keyboard to navigate this thing.\n\nTo me, these all feel like very, um, power usery type of, even like, um, like programmer type of ways of interacting with an app. Do you see that like normal people are able to utilize these features effectively? This is a great question, and this is a question we have internally because our, uh, initial ICP, so like the ideal customer profile, was the like barrier, or by extension, uh, like tech industry funer. So usually young, usually tech savvy and highly productive and wanted to like, I would say, gain some time. So those people were the right, the right target to get like keyboard shortcuts and everything. They were like looking for it and even like expecting it. It's more clicky, uh, now as we, we were like more and more, um, present on the market. So basically all startups were, I would say, and still are using like Superhuman. Those startups got acquired by, by bigger groups, and you see those like sea level of startups being acquired complaining, I would say, to the bigger group saying like, no, no, no, we want to keep it. So now we have like big companies basically saying to us, hey guys, we need to standardize and Superhuman, but like not all the population is tech heavy like this. Uh, what do you propose? And and that's something that, um, that is tricky to some extent, but and this is where the, I was mentioning in the beginning, like the PLG motion and the education motion is something that, uh, is very important for us and and our success because even the people that are not that tech savvy, if you go through the basically those like in product, uh, education moments, you get used to it, and you're like, oh, damn, it's easy, like enter, anyone can do enter, and then you start with enter, and then maybe you start with like the E, which is archiving things, like, oh, archiving works well, and maybe you use that one, and then you learn about the second one, maybe like weeks later. So the curve of addition is might be, might be like a bit slower for the non techs heavy people. But eventually, like the the speed at which you operate with those keyboard shortcuts is crazy.\n\nAnd it's interesting because there's a lot of discussion about like the change of user interaction with devices and voice becoming more and more important. I still believe that keyboard shortcuts like would be like so much easier than voice, like for like doing the archive for sure, like and and things like this. So yes, we're talking about it. Not yet to the point where we want to add like a lot of like ribbon, like I can't imagine having a ribbon with like a different actions for people that are very outlooky, uh, to, to, to some extent can feel that, oh yeah, that's the same or close enough. So, but that's a question we have correct.\n\nYeah, I do, I, I would see that the like more like voice type of thing would be very useful on, on mobile, uh, where you don't have access to that. Right. Although you do have swipes and and those types of things that that tend to fill that space. The keyboard shortcuts I use the most are archive, the up and down to to traverse them, and then the H to reschedule an email. So yeah, that one to me, you know, Wes, you really liked Sentry's date selector where you could just like kind of type whatever you wanted in. This thing is like next level.\n\nYeah, this thing is next level like that. You could say, you know, 3 days, 8:00 a.m., next week sometime, whatever. I mean, you can, you can type in whatever the heck you want in this thing, and it, it manages to get your next Thursday, whatever, and it, it just works. How does something like that work?\n\nSo, like the H1, for example, that's the one that I use the most. So, H to basically like make your email disappear and only come back when you believe it will make sense. Good example is like, oh, I don't want to treat that today. Uh, I want to focus on this tomorrow. So, HT enter enter. Boom. Your email is gone. And the T for tomorrow. That's probably the one that I use the most, like next week, next month, or like I would say today or tomorrow at 2 p.m. So that's I would say the type of things that I, I use a lot because I want to reach inbox zero. Whereas like one thing like that is really key for our users is reaching inbox zero because you just get rid of the cognitive load, and when you reach that point where you have nothing, and like, oh, everything has been treated, and you don't have to mark stuff and read because you, you want to get to it at some point and everything, which is, which is like the typical flow for like Gmail or Outlook. It feels so great, and to do this, basically, you postpone stuff for to when it makes sense. So usually like, oh yeah, I know that I want to tweet like those type of email on Friday, HF and Friday, beam, it's done, and um, one second, and it's ready. So you can go through like hundred of emails a day, which is roughly set what I receive, u, this way into like the like 15 minutes at the end of the day. It's pretty awesome.\n\nI don't want the audience to think this episode is a, uh, no endorsement. No, no, you're fine. But I have found personally, cuz I, I, when I get excited about things, folks, I, I tend to like turn into a salesman for it. So, I, I apologize for that. But I have found that I, I hit inbox zero just about every morning with this thing. And it's turned what I do in my daily ritual for email is that I tend to not look at email more than twice a day. I'll open up my email in the morning. I'll either get rid of things I need to do in another day or whatever, mark them as done, take care of everything I need to do, get to inbox zero, and then close out the email for the day. And I haven't found another system that allows me to do this as quickly, primarily because just yeah, HTT for the stuff I don't want to do, uh, today, I can take care of it tomorrow. And as somebody with like attention issues, treating your inbox as your to-do list ends up becoming just like a really pleasant experience overall, which I, I tend to hate email. So yeah, everyone hates email. Everyone hates email.\n\nSo, so that's a good way. And interestingly, maybe like the last plug I would say for Superhuman, but, uh, what we see is in the, uh, I would say our customer base is like they save like four hours a week. Um, so it doesn't apply to, I would say, if you're a typical engineer with like in a, in a big team. So you don't manage third parties, you don't manage a board, you not manage like a lot of people, you will be probably living your life in Slack way more and hopefully in Slack and not in teams or like any other one. Uh, so that might not apply, but when you start to be like in leadership roles or your role, maybe you are like a freelancer and you spend, I would say, a lot of time in emails night and day. So like four hours a week, uh, this is typically what people save, and they reply usually like 48 hours faster, uh, than before. So that's the type of like metric that we have, and some people are crazy, I would say, there's like a wide range of people within that, but like that's the average.\n\nI think one of the big takeaways I have from Superhuman in general is that like, you all have made a technical choice based on, you know, companywide philosophies of it, it being fast in quality, right? And you made your check technical choices to align with that, to use local data, and through that, you've created a product that delights people. It is fast as hell, and overall, like, really feels good to use. And I, I, I've been talking a lot about local data on this show, and I think that's an like an important thing is that oftentimes we think about, oh, I'll use local data, but like, you, you all started with the experience, what need experience needs to be there, and then that probably determined to use the local data and then the keyboard shortcuts and all these things, and it really, really, uh, I think worked out in a great way for you all.\n\nThough, but it has a cost. Like one thing that is really important for people to understand, like if you're starting your company, and this has like a freaking cost, like you need to basically understand that, uh, delight and like that speed is something that is an investment. We are native, most like for iOS and Android for that purpose. Being native has a cost. We could have used Flutter or whatever like, uh, other framework to basically build once and use everywhere. We decided to be like a very intentional. We, I would say, are local first. So you were talking about like sync engines, like syncing is probably like the number one, not pain, but like challenge that we have that is tricky because you have network. So you have some sort like a pepsub, uh, like mechanism on every single device in every single platform that we are using. But that's typically business logic that you would typically provide and only once in your back end or your back end for front end, like whatever the the architecture that you're following. But typically in a B2B SAS company that doesn't care about speed, you would manage that there and manage like the pups back on the back end. But we want to be offline first. So you need to have that approach on the local device. It has a cost. Every time we want to do some modification about syncing. So you were talking about calendar, number one, I would say, feature of all our users, like they bring us calendar the same way you save email, and and we're working on it, but which it means that on every single device, we need to kind of like adapt our like syncing engine for managing like the different events to say work with the API of Outlook and and Gmail. So it has a cost. It has a cost, but we do believe that, uh, this cost is worth it because I mean, we have like our users, they love the product, and they don't go elsewhere because the experience is so great. So again, um, it's different business strategy. The business strategy here was a bit like Apple. We might not be the first. Well, we will be a close second, but we will be the best. So it has a cost. It has a cost. Your sync engine is that all custom stuff, or is that being done through Realm?\n\nSo the, the storage capacity is like through Realm, but like we have this concept of modifiers, uh, so it's roughly said a pepsub mechanism. So when we want to archive an email, so we have a modifier that we basically log like every single stuff that you're doing on that email, archive, unarchived, archived, unarchived, if you want to play with it. On top of it, we have like the undo capacity, like we give you like 10 seconds because, oh shoot, I made a typo, a typo, and I didn't use AI to rewrite my email. No, no, no, no, no. Z, uh, so that you don't send the email. So like you need to have like basically like a stack of actions, um, that you can go through, and we want to implement that offline. So it needs to be present on every single device. So we call that modifiers, and it's roughly said like a stack of actions that will be synced. I would say, as soon as you have the network, it will be synced with the back end that implements also those modifiers and will then implement the changes in Gmail or in Outlook where it's, uh, it needs to happen.\n\nAwesome. Yeah, this is so fascinating as a one, a fan of local data stuff, and two, as a big-time user of this app, I, I sincerely appreciate all the time you've taken to to break this down for us.\n\nYeah. And maybe like one, one interesting things like our front end engineers and like JavaScript engineers. We have two kind of engineers, like people working on the UX and the people working what on what we call the background, which is kind of like the back end of the local stacks, and we have like a platform team that is usually treating those, um, like nitty-gritty, almost like backendy problems on the device, uh, because it's, I mean, you\n\n\nYou face like the same race conditions, the same, like, yeah, eventual consistency of [ __ ] that you, sorry, this time I said it like that, you have typically on the back end, which is not typically common for like JavaScript users, unless you're using node on the back end, but we're a go shop.\n\nSick. Wes, do you have anything else you want to get to here?\n\nNo, I, I think that's good. I was, I was specifically going to ask about that of like, like the logic layer and the UI layer, but you pretty much just answered it, so that's really interesting. When it's when most of the code runs on the device, there's not really a back end, right? So, that was really neat to hear.\n\nNo, the back, our back end is uh, lightweight to some uh, to some extent compared to the the number of like emails we we are managing. But like the the back end on the device is pretty extensive.\n\nWhat code do you run on your servers?\n\nSo, it's go uh, we're a Google Cloud Platform shop. Um, everything is running on Google Cloud Platform. We have a like small cluster uh, running on GKE, which is like the managed Kubernetes uh, platform. We use posgress. There's some uh, I would say radius uh, here and there for caching and the pepsub is like the I would say that the pepsub from uh, from Google there. So pretty pretty lightweight. I think we have something like four or five, I wouldn't say like services, but like we have one monolith. So it's mostly like a modulus uh, architecture to some extent on the back end.\n\nSo here, here's a question. Last week Google went down for a couple hours and it took Cloudflare down with it as well.\n\nCorrect.\n\nDid you have downtime and what did that look like for your app?\n\nYeah. So this is a great question. So we are offline first. Yeah. So which means that during that outage, the only problem that you had was that we couldn't receive new emails because like Google was basically down uh, so like Gmail was downish, so receiving new emails was not possible, but we stack everything. So we had to replay transparent for our user. They send emails, like everything that is email answering, email sending, and all of that totally transparent because it's managed locally and then it's like going to our back end when they have the network and the the back end is kind of like replaying everything. So we had like a a long stack of emails that were waiting for the outage to be done and tact, we basically manage, we managed that. We had some issues because of the attachment and there were some issues with attachment because like we had one bug. So it was like an not an incident, like it was an incident internally, but like not seen by our end users.\n\nWow.\n\nSo we're used to it, like Outlook uh, like their um, graph API tends to break every new version because they, I don't know what they're doing, but like they break stuff relatively often, but like it's mostly not seen uh, on on our side. So the only impact is like you will have like a small notification. Hey, G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G Gmail is facing some issues, but that's about it. That's about it.\n\nAll right, I think that's all for today. Anything else you want to add before we wrap this sucker up?\n\nNo, no, thanks for having me. That was super cool, guys. Great discussions and always great to to talk about like tech stuff.\n\nYeah, I appreciate it. Well, thank you so much for coming on and appreciate all your time.\n\nThanks, guys. Peace.\n\nThank you.\n",
