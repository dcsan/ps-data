  "cleanText": "I'm recording there. I'm recording here.\nYeah. Let's clap it in and go.\nHuh.\nHey gang, welcome to episode two of Open Path. My name is Chad Whitacre and we're here to talk about open source and the Open Source Pledge. Episode 1 was a little weird. Episode two is built around an interview that I did with my friend Adam, who is an accountant. He's a Certified Public Accountant. So yes, it is kind of a podcast after all, but it's more than a podcast. Podcast plus. The plus is Traalog. The plus is conversations with others. I went and talked to a bunch of CTOs in New York City. I went and talked to a bunch of maintainers at the Python conference and I visited a classroom at my local community college. But really, yeah, the point here is to grow the Open Source Pledge, to explore open source together. We're going to start with an explanation of the narrative world of Open Path using some voice over that I recorded here outside of New York City and then we'll get into the interview with Adam and we'll go from there. This is long form gang. This is a 40-minute episode. So, settle in, get yourself some popcorn, and enjoy episode two of Open Path. All right, we're rolling. Let's clap it in.\nThe Open Source Initiative had an election recently. I ran in the election. Didn't win. Came in second. But like 150 people voted in that election. There's 8 billion people in the world. And what? 6 billion have cell phones. And all those people have phones that are built on top of open source software. I have no idea.\nThe way that I see this world, this like open- source plus+ world that I'm working with here in the show is it's got kind of four points.\nInsiders and outsiders and producers and consumers.\n[Music]\nProducers of open source software, that's the maintainers. That's all you maintainers out there. Consumers of open source software, that's all the companies that are using open source software. The main goal is to unlock funding from the consumers of open source software reciprocating back to the producers.\nInsiders are those, you know, 150 people that vote in the OSI election.\nAnd then the outsiders is everybody, you know, the 8 billion people in the world that don't even know Yeah. that don't know what we've got.\nGive me three claps.\nWho do you want me to be?\n Yourself, man.\n Okay.\nHi, Adam.\nHi, Jeff.\n May I have some story?\nFunny. You should ask for the love of open source. Man, I love open source.\nWhat do you know about open source?\nUh, so it used to be fun to hate Bill Gates. When you're on slash, you would scroll through the articles and the icon of Bill Gates would have the little droid thing on his\n Oh my goodness. Yeah.\non his\n Terminator probably reference\non the subject of space balls. You used to spell Microsoft with the dollar sign, right? And they were so evil. So I think when I was more into open source.\n Okay.\nIt was easier because there was a clear bad guy. I'm drinking more Star than I probably should than you.\n Adam, what's your story?\n Where'd you go to school?\nLet me see if I can guess because I'm sure you've told me this before. He doesn't know. You went to school west of the Mississippi.\n No, wait. East of the Mississippi. The other one.\n[Music]\nMiami University of Ohio.\n Yes. Very good.\nSo, I went to Miami University and I just wanted to learn how to run a business.\n Why'd you want to learn how to run a business? because I wanted to start a landscaping business.\n Okay, wait.\nMy family owns the largest apple orchard in Ohio.\n Better and better.\n There's a lot of farming in the family.\n Good is where that story is going.\nAnd my dad also like worked at a nursery growing up and uh loved to do landscaping and I just genuinely liked it.\n You picked up always like to do it.\nA good day in the spring for me was I would take everything out the compost pile.\n Yeah.\n I would put it on top of the little raised bed garden that we had and I would spend an hour or two turning it all over with a shovel.\n This is great.\nI'm learning so much about you.\n You know compost is ready when it smells rich and it smells like it wants to nourish some plants. Like it just smells right. Have you ever tried open source composting?\nOpensource as a movement started in 1998.\n1998. It was built on the foundation of the Free Software movement. So free software.\n Oh, so we're differentiating.\nWe can.\n Okay.\n Yes. Okay.\n Those on the inside will differentiate. Free software started by Richard Stallman in 1983. 83.\n83. You're going back.\n Okay. Okay.\n 15 years later, the open-source movement starts really as a rebrand. This question of free, what does free mean?\n Okay.\n Free as in speech or free as in beer.\n Does that free as in beer mean the price is zero?\n Yes.\n Okay.\nFree as in the other one is freedom.\nOkay.\n Yes. Human freedom. Um autonomy.\nUm freedom to do what you want.\n What's that? It's getting deep in here.\n Yeah.\nWell, that's what we're here for.\n Okay.\nPosted up at Deploy Coffee in Chinatown about to deploy over to this restaurant for CTO lunches. Um Forest is almost here. Hi, Forest. How's it going?\n Hey, it is a beautiful day here in New York City and a great day for CTO lunch.\nYeah, CTO lunch. Where are we headed?\nWe're heading over to Jing Fong, which is a dim sang place uh at the top of Chinatown here where we've been meeting all year.\n Yeah. All right, let's go do it.\nWho uses open source at their company?\nWho pays anybody on GitHub sponsors?\nWhat's the level set? Do the engineers in your company contribute to open source projects upstream outside of your company?\n I think especially fixing bugs, that's very normal.\n I've heard about it anecdotally like once or twice in the last um let's call it 10 years. Before we started recording, I presented this idea of the Open Source Pledge feedback.\nWhat do you think?\n Can you explain what happens to the the funding? Where does that funding go?\n Every company decides for themselves which foundations they're going to support or there's platforms.\nThe big three platforms are GitHub sponsors, Open Collective, if anyone's heard of that, and then there's a newer one called thanks.dev. Thanks. Dev has an algorithm for this.\n Ah, there's an algorithm for it, of course.\n[Music]\nAll right. So, I want to go back to young Adam turning the compost and dreaming of starting a landscaping company.\n Okay.\nAnd of course, your natural step on the way was to go to Miami University for an accounting degree.\nRight.\n Accounting degree.\n Accounting.\nSo, all right. So, you studied accounting at Miami University. I wanted to know how to run a company. And I think most people that run small companies have all their receipts in a shoe box.\n In a small business where one person does all the bookkeeping, the duties include a variety of work.\nActually quite frightens me to know how uh small business owners would do their accounting.\nAnd you didn't want to be that. You wanted to learn accounting so you could run a business. The world's weirdest landscaper.\nWorld's best landscaper.\n Best landscaper.\n I want to be the landscaper with the best, cleanest set of debits and credits.\nLook, you want to you see my income statement? I'll click the button on GNU cash right now and I'll be able to show it to you.\n Okay.\n The suspense is killing me. Have you ever owned a landscaping company?\n[Music]\n[Music]\nNick, I'm Simon and there's my clap.\nGood to meet you, Larry.\n I maintain coverage.pay, the coverage measurement tool for Python. I've been doing that for a little more than 20 years. Piodide incription which is the compiler tool chain Python itself a lot of of stuff that's upstream of piodide I maintain nose 2 I've recently started to get involved in the Python packaging space I spend a lot of time working on home assistant giant amount of Bluetooth libraries ESP home and kind of all that ecosystem as well and about another 200 other various Python libraries all around that ecosystem\n 200 that's a lot yeah it's a lot most of my day job is real estate So this is just a side kind of project for me.\n I work for University of Chicago.\n Do you do a lot of open source work outside of your day job?\nYeah, I am currently employed by Cloudflare making piodide work in their worker runtime.\n In the late '7s, mid70s I think it was software was brought under the copyright intellectual property regime\njust folded into that pre-existing framework. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, intellectual property. You got copyright, you got trademarks, and then you got a couple others. Patents. What's the fourth one? I forget. So, trademark is your brand name, your logo. And then patents are about ideas and inventions.\nYes.\n And then copyright is used for works of art, a book.\n Okay.\n Music. These are things that are copyright.\n A nolla.\nA nolla. An essay.\n YouTube video.\n A YouTube video maybe. Absolutely. Yeah.\nSo, when you have a copyrighted work, what you do is you give other people the rights to do things with it via a license. A license is a legal instrument that you use to give somebody else the right to do stuff with your copyrighted work.\n Okay. Never thought of it that way. That's part of what it is.\n[Music]\nHas anyone experienced burnout on their open source project? Leonard\n Leonard gave a talk about that at maintainer summit last year here at PYON.\n Was there a role for money in that conversation in that burnout experience?\n There is um because a big contributing factor to the burnout was the the things that I was doing to earn money.\n Um so if those needs had been met some other way then the stress would have been a lot less.\nYeah. So licensing is the way that we share our creative works with the world.\nlicenses express things like you're allowed to use this but only for non-commercial purposes. You're allowed to use this but you have to pay me $100 first. Right? So there's these restrictions that are placed on the permission that we give people to reuse things.\nOpen source is part of that framework.\nOkay?\n And it's very permissive. So the simplest open source licenses well you saw that beerware one.\n As long as you retain this notice, you can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet someday and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.\n You can buy me a beer in return.\nTo me, the beerware license is the quintessential open source license.\nOkay.\n Because of the spirit of invitation. A gift carries with it an invitation to reciprocate.\nAll right, I'm with you.\n Yeah. You know, this is what I'm talking to you. Okay.\nYeah.\n What I'm bringing is open source is a gift economy.\nOkay. Yes.\nI think maintainership has some work that is, you know, inherently complex and difficult. And then there's things that are just tedious and in a better world would not be problems of maintainership.\n Probably 20 to 30% of my time in the open source space is just helping people raise money so they can fund their project. So I get some money and it has not been difficult to get that amount of money because there are services like GitHub sponsors or Tidelift or thanks.dev.\n The question is how do you get people to go to those places and put money into them, right?\nPart of the problem is that we go into open source with this sort of gift economy ethos. I'm doing it because I love it and I love that people use my stuff and it gives me pleasure to see that people use my stuff. Partly we love that it is free.\n Yeah. But then we wish it weren't just free.\n Yeah, this is exactly the problem that I have. I've got GitHub sponsors and I get money for it. But actually turning that into significant income is a lot of work.\nGitHub sponsors is set up with levels of sponsorship and they have a place where you can say what do you get for each level? And I couldn't think of what to put on each level. So the first level is you get to feel good. The next level is you get to feel really good. Literally that's what my sponsorship levels say cuz I couldn't think of anything else to put in there. There are people who've got really successful with GitHub sponsors by saying at the higher tiers you get access to videos and documentation\nvideos and and and when I create a video or documentation I want to put that out there for free to improve the product, you know, I'm not upset about the fact that I don't get financially rewarded for my open source things cuz the impact it's had on my career and relationships and my ability to write software is I can write so much software because of all the open source that's given to me.\nSo there is an amazing economy around that. It's just I'd like it if it could also practically support from an economic from a financial point of view. That would be the dream.\n In a previous job, I was in charge of an open source mission. I would talk to died in the wool open source people and say would you consider giving money and they would say what do I get for my money? I'm like if you're saying what do I get for my money? How do we go to the real capitalists?\nAll of our companies have received the gift of open source and the conversation we're having with the pledge is okay, how do we reciprocate? The invitation is take this back to your company. Talk to your team about it. Check us out.\nopensourcepledge.com. It's kind of like at the end of the meal here, we're all going to settle up and just imagine if this is the whole tech industry here.\n I would not want to run the tech industry the way we settle our restaurant bills.\nDouglas Adams famously said that the math used to calculate the bill at the end of a of a meal is the most complicated math in the universe. The engine for the improbability drive of the heart of gold spaceship runs a simulation of people having a meal over and over again and then settling up the check. Speaking of that, I actually have to go. Can I someone?\n Yeah, when we get to check, we'll just double that in 14 ways. Usually we do.\nLet me just make sure.\n\n\nInfinite\nprobability depends on\nmy\ncash if not\nbeautiful. Oh my god, people are\nbringing cash.\nIt also potentially opens up the\npossibility of gaming the system. I find\nout if there are any ways to get an\nextra\n I think in addition to like the\npledge being based on money maybe also\nbased on like time. So instead of having\ndevs or the companies contribute x many\ndollars just having them contribute x\nmany hours of development towards open\nsource projects. Um and hopefully the\nmodel should be that it incentivizes\n I\nhave a card too.\n Okay. We got cards\n or I\nwas going to send you money.\n Yeah. So,\nlet's um\n yeah, you want to send me the\nengine.\n What's the best way? Like, can I\nVenmo?\nI think we Venmo for us.\n All right.\nOkay, that works.\n Thank you so much.\n So,\nhow do we find you for us?\n Yeah.\n[Music]\nHave you ever owned a landscaping\ncompany?\nNot even close. I've given up the dream.\nYou gave up the dream.\n I've given up the\ndream. The dream is the dream is dead.\nNo man, I don't like hearing that.\nHere's what No. See,\n is the dream\nrevable?\n Part of the beauty of life,\nChad, is that\n you can dreams are\nmodular. You can\n you can take one out\nand put one in. I don't lose any sleep\nover not running.\n No. Was that a crisis\nfor you at some point when you woke up\none day and you're like, I'm not a\nlandscaper?\n Um,\nno. But to be completely honest,\n yeah,\n I\nwent to Columbus for a family job I\ndidn't see coming and then uh got liver\ncancer and\n Oh, right.\n So, I was lucky to\nbe alive and lucky to have a job and\nthen eventually came back here. So, no.\n[Music]\nGosh. Yeah. Tuesday was wild, man. It\nwas so chaotic in Times Square.\nThe group before us had like 150 people\nand, you know, filled this whole area\nwith their gray t-shirts and, you know,\nhaving a lot of fun together out there\ncelebrating.\nAnd when it was our turn, it was just me\nand my friend Jake, who's local here,\nthat was helping me out with filming.\nAnd so, you know, they all\nshuffle out and we were over in this\nlike corner and I had the tripod set up\nthe camera and I was trying to get it\nset up and then the time came and we\nwere only going to be up there for like\n2 minutes, right? Cuz this is like\nNASDAQ's helping us out with this. While\nI'm setting the camera up, of course,\nour sign comes up. I'm stuck behind the\ncamera in this corner. So, I try to get\nout from behind the camera, end up\nkicking the tripod and sending the\ncamera flying it. And I'm gonna sneak\naround in front. Wow.\nBefore you do your recording, you get a\nphoto.\nThat's perfect. That's so perfect. This\nis going to make for some great\ntelevision.\n I know, right?\n The camera\nfalling.\n Yes.\nOh, the lens breaking. Yeah, this is\ngreat. This is fantastic. So, I pull out\nmy iPhone and end up getting some\nfootage and it all worked out fine. All\nright, it's happening.\nBelieve it or not,\nNASDAQ congratulates the latest\ncompanies to join Open Source Pledge.\nOkay.\n[Music]\nAll right, that was it.\nFort Pit. Wow,\nthat was dramatic.\n I know. It's also\njust really gray and foggy. I mean, it's\nbeautiful weather today and yesterday\nwas beautiful, but Tuesday was so gray.\nIt is cold.\n It's cold.\n Cold out. The\nweather.\n Yeah. What happened?\n I was\nlike,\n bring our card in. If you don't\nI'm trying to understand enough of the\nworld of accounting to know even what\nquestion I'm trying to ask. Let's come\nback to this\n gift economy. Market\neconomy.\nOpen source is a gift economy.\nAccountants are really good at\naccounting for market transactions.\nYou see what I'm saying? You see where\nI'm going with this?\n Right. Right.\nshould be part of the same decision as\nwhat um other charities are we going to\nsupport and we want people to know that\nso we want you know to have our name on\na banner in the little league or is it\nthe same decision as all the other\nsoftware you're going to pay for and\nit's just an expense I feel like it's\nI want it to be the second one I want it\nto be the second one because in the\ncharity little league case we're maybe\ngetting a little bit of marketing\nexposure from it I want it to more of\nthat value exchange like you get if I'm\npaying Zenesk X per seat the gift of the\nvalue that I've received from them. I'm\nlooking to reciprocate,\n right?\n Yeah. Is\nthat an accounting question or task?\nWhat would be the role of the accountant\nin that kind of thing?\n Do you want to\nknow where my accounting brain went on\nthat?\n Yes, absolutely.\n Okay. So, if it's\nuh not a charitable contribution, the\naccountant's just going to be\nuh confused.\nWhy\n accountants get confused easily?\nOkay.\n Why? Because um well there's that\nthe first question would be where in the\nchart of accounts do we have an expense\ncategory that's not a charitable\ncontribution and and not something that\nthat you're contractually obligated to\npay? Like it's typically not a thing\nthat you do.\nThen really from the accountant's point\nof view what would be needed would be an\nevolution to the chart of accounts\nperhaps. Perhaps\n auditing books is just\none type of service offered by an\naccountant, public or private.\nAnother type is devising new or improved\nbookkeeping systems.\nCompanies often outgrow their old record\nforms so they have an accountant study\nthe problem, devise a new system, and\nsupervise its operation until the\ncompany employees can carry on a loan.\nWhat are the highle parts of the chart\nof accounting? The fundamental equation\nin accounting, yeah,\n is assets equals\nliability plus owner's equity.\n So those\nare the first three major categories. So\nthose would be the 10,00s, the two, and\nthe three.\n Okay?\n And then you get into\nincome and expense.\n Okay?\n Income and\nexpense.\n Okay?\n And those will roll up\ninto equity.\n Okay.\n Okay. So within\nexpenses, you have, you know, is it\ngeneral and administrative? Does it\nsupport production? Is it a salary? So\nif you're an accounting firm, let's say\nthis is software that we're doing the\nbooks and records on.\n So that's in a\ndirect expense category. And within\nthat, it's one of the lines of software\nexpense.\nAnd I'm just looking at that.\n Let's use\nGNU cash\n in there.\n If Mlen and\nAssociates,\n Mcclen\n used GNU cash\n Mhm.\nand chose to pay for it.\n Yeah.\n Where\nwould it go? Let's make it real. I mean,\nthat's a great question, right? Um,\nwell, I I think contributions.\n You still\nwant to make it a charitable\ncontribution?\n I would think a charitable\ncontribution because it's not\nI don't owe that money. There I was\nnever sent a bill. I never\nI've signed an agreement for monthly\ncharge. Obviously, that goes into some\nsort of software expense. But if it's\nsomething we just decide to pay because\nwe want to support the software\ndeveloper,\nmay make a new line.\n Another type of\nservice is cost accounting for\nmanufacturers. Accountants doing this\nwork must be thoroughly familiar with\nthe manufacturing processes involved.\nThey must be able to devise record\nsystems which will give complete and\naccurate information concerning the\ncosts of even the smallest item in the\nproduct.\nIt is not easy to determine the cost of\nmaking a certain product. Yet, if the\nbusiness is to be conducted efficiently\nand profitably, the company must have\nsuch information. If in your processes,\nyeah,\n you replace QuickBooks with GNU,\nwhy would GNU Cashache not go in the\nexact same spot in the chart of\naccounts?\n Um, so it could, it is an\nexpense you're choosing to, but the word\nchoose is what's making this different,\nright?\nYou're not required to. Typically, you\nwant to pay something if you don't have\nto.\nThat's above the account.\n The decision\nto pay is not the accountants. It's the\naccounting for it that's the accountants\nproblem.\n Yeah.\n Right.\n Who chooses to buy\nQuickBooks?\n It would be the person in\ncharge of the the tech budget.\n Okay. So,\nif the person in charge of the tech\nbudget came to you and said, &quot;I'm paying\ninstead of $10,000 theoretically for\nQuickBooks, if came to you and said, I'm\npaying $10,000 for GNU cash.&quot;\n Yeah.\nI just say, &quot;Wait, we're not required to\npay for that?&quot; And I would need to talk\nto my boss to get the okay on it. If you\nreally want to be theoretical about it,\nI don't know where it goes because it's\nnot\nit's not like any of the other ones.\n[Music]\nYou're up here from Philadelphia.\n Yeah,\nit is my birthday.\n What?\n I know.\n Happy\nbirthday to you.\n London.\nYeah, I'm from somewhere way more\nromantic. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Oh,\nreally?\n I heard all the kids are like\nholding these up now.\n This is like\n I\nhave no idea what it is,\n bro. This is\nfunny as hell.\nWhat's up?\nWhen was the last time you were in\nsettings, Tula?\n Um, today I have no\nstorage, so it's every day.\n That's\ntrouble. Do you have an iPhone?\n Yeah.\nYou have beerware on your phone.\nBeerware.\n Did you know that?\n What's\nbeerware?\n Scroll down to general. You're\nright there. General.\n General.\n Scroll\ndown a little bit to legal.\n Legal.\n There\nit is. Boom.\n What the\n Boom. What\ndo you think?\n This is crazy.\nPK login. Don't want to break this file.\nAs long as you retain this notice, you\ncan do whatever you want with this\nstuff.\n Keep going.\n If we meet someday\nand you think this stuff is worth it,\nyou can buy me a beer in return.\n What do\nyou think?\n Did you write that?\n You have\nto tell her. All right.\n Okay. We going\nto show him now. My name's Chad.\n I don't\neven understand like what we're talking\nabout. Honestly, this is like looking at\nyou can buy me a beer in return.\nWhat was the last person you bought a\nbeer for?\nUh my friend on Friday cuz it was his\nbirthday.\n Yeah.\nHow did you find out about this? Like\nwhy are you interested in this right\nnow?\n What?\n What do you think?\n Did he buy\nyou a beer on your birthday?\n Uh I can't\nremember.\n Okay.\n Victoria, would you buy\nhim a beer if he was here?\n No.\n No.\n Tast\na lot of beers. So I'm pretty good in\nthis world. If you like IPAs,\n you got\nhim coming.\n I got him an IPA.\n My\nbirthday is the past five year. Four or\nfive years since co haven't really been\nanything special. So\n a come on.\n Yeah.\nWell, you got to get back to it, man.\nYou got to have a birthday party for\nyourself. Do it Bill Baggin style and\nthrow the party for everybody else.\nYeah.\n Open source is a gift where people\nmake software and they give it to the\nworld and the world uses it. Apple uses\nthis software\n and it's like, &quot;Hey man,\nif you like my software, buy me a beer.&quot;\nAnd Apple's like, &quot;Does that compute.&quot;\nNot to be a downer, but I lost my dad\nlast year, too. So, I've been dealing\nwith my dad being terminally ill.\n I lost\nmy dad two years ago.\n Yeah. Sorry.\nSorry.\n My dad's in the hospital. Is he\ngetting an update?\n He say he's getting\nout today.\n No, he's getting an update.\nHe just It's one of those when you're 80\nyears old and sometimes when you get\nsick, you don't get well. Sometimes\nyou'll get sicker and end up in the\nhospital for a few days.\n It's coming up\nhere in uh Wait, what's today's for me?\nOh my god. Mine was May 23rd. I think\nhe's getting back out. So\nthat's so crazy.\n Yeah.\nSo I'm sorry.\nOh,\n[Music]\nwell I guess we were meant to meet for\nwhatever reason.\n Yeah, right.\n I\nappreciate you.\n Yeah, you too. Are you\non Instagram or something?\n Viewer. Okay,\nnice.\n All right. I appreciate you guys.\nHave a good night. All right. We'll see\nyou.\n Okay. And then I'll see you.\n Have a\ngreat day. Cheers, guys.\n[Music]\nI was 37 when I worked as a landscaper.\nOkay.\n[Music]\nThat's hard work.\n Yes, I only did it one\nday a week.\n Very hard work. Okay,\n one\nday a week. Granted, it is hard work. I\ndid it once a week. And yeah, for the\nfirst couple weeks, man, it was like I I\nwas not doing much the next day.\n[Music]\nBy the end of that summer, I had a\nreally good tan and I was in really good\nshape.\n Okay. So you got you came around.\nI did.\n By the end, you were like\nslinging mulch with the rest of them.\n Oh\nyeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I get you on the\nlandscaping thing.\n At least someone I\nknow went in to landscaping partially.\nSo I could say my dream was\n realized,\njust not by me.\nCheers.\n[Music]\nHere's what I really need, Adam. Yeah,\n I\nneed a generation of accountants for\nwhom this is not weird.\nThis is good.\n Try and dial yourself back\nto Miami University and imagine young\nAdam dreams of becoming a landscaper\nsitting in class and absorbing this\nknowledge that's just second nature for\nyou now. You know what I mean? Like the\nmindset that you've got now in which\nthis is weird.\n Dial it back to that like\nblank slate moment. What class were you\nsitting in?\n[Music]\nWhat's the class that I need to talk to\nprofessors\n to alter the curriculum in\nthis class so that the next generation\nof Adam Steinfirst don't think this is\nweird?\n You need to teach it in a way\nthat it's\n it's okay to put that in\nexpense.\n The nature of it is that you're\npaying for software that you're using.\nYeah. That conversation would start in\nthis accounting 101.\n When we think about\nrunning a company and the finances of a\ncompany, what are some of the basic\nprinciples\n for it to work? You need to\nlike have some\n\n\nSort of system to keep track of it.\nOkay.\nI don't know how else like an accounting system.\nYeah, an accounting system.\nApple and Google are using all of these open-source software components to build the software on your phone.\nApparently, it's also turned into a bit of an obscure internet meme, too.\nDigital infrastructure project some random person in Nebraska has been thankfully maintaining since 2003.\nYeah.\nMuhammad, this isn't you, is it?\nMuhammad Abdullah.\nOh, that's not Okay.\nDifferent Muhammad.\nOkay.\nI won't be here.\nOkay.\nAs long as you retain this notice, you can do whatever you want with this stuff.\nIt's just that's fine.\nWould you buy him a beer, Tessa?\nYeah.\nYou would?\nIt's not legal, but I probably\nDenmark.\nWhat's the drinking age?\nGift economy.\nDo you ever hear the phrase gift economy?\nYes.\nYeah.\nIt's very different because you walk away from that.\nYou have a connection with your friend.\nReally appreciate.\nGot your drink, Kiki.\nWhat are we drinking?\nStar.\nDoes anybody know Star?\nIs that what it is?\nIt just because their copyright ran out and they were like, &quot;Oh, we're going to sue this lady cuz she's using our name.&quot;\nAnd then she was like, &quot;Actually, your copyright ran out.\nI bought it.&quot;\nAnd then she wouldn't give it back to them.\nThere's a whole thing.\nYeah.\nThey were like, &quot;Yeah, a case study.\nDid you do a case study back and she was like, I already own it.\nYou guys pay your name back.&quot;\nSo then that's why is now\nI had no idea.\nYeah.\nThis changes everything.\n[Music]\nOne, two, three.\nYou know, I'm sitting here at Kennywood Amusement Park in Pennsylvania and I'm thinking about open source and this whole thing where I'm interviewing everybody about beerware, right?\nLike I did we did that with some of the kids in line at one of the uh one of the roller coasters.\nRoller coaster over there.\nLet's get a roller coaster in here.\nI haven't opened that one yet.\nAnd I'm getting the feels because everyone has a phone and everyone's phone has open- source software on it.\nAnd it feels like\n[Music]\nopen-source software is a gift that we all share.\nIt unites us.\nAnd we don't even know it.\n[Music]\nYou know, people find out about it.\nThey're like, &quot;How do you know about this beer wear?&quot;\nRight?\nBeware is the funny thing.\nSome people ask, &quot;Is this you?&quot;\nIt's like, &quot;No, but I know the guy.&quot;\n[Music]\nBut people love it when they find out that that's at the heart of our civilization is this gift of software that we've given each other everybody.\nI don't know there's something there.\nMaybe maybe what we did with the pledge is we started with this $2,000 per developer number.\nI recently had the privilege to sit down with my friend, the neighbor TV show extraordinaire Chad Whitacre.\nWe talked about open-source software and he's leading something called the open- source pledge.\nIt's a complicated calculation.\nWe need a spreadsheet to do it.\nWe're going to go through how to lay out that spreadsheet right now.\nThis is the number of full-time equivalent programmers at your company.\nWe'll say we have a pretty big company.\nWe're in software.\nSo, we we have 12 programmers.\nThe suggested donation amount is $2,000.\nSo, we'll type that in.\nAnd here we want some sort of formula to multiply two numbers.\nOkay.\nSo, obviously what we want is the aggregate function.\nAll right.\nWe made it there and back again.\nWhat do you think?\nEpisode two.\nKind of interesting, right?\nWe had some fun.\nI really liked the way that talking to Adam, we found kind of the limitations of our current accounting practices when we think about open source as a gift economy.\nAnd if we're going to be true to that nature of open source as a gift economy, we're going to have to evolve on the accounting side.\nSo, that's going to be fun to play out.\nIf you need something to watch next, you can go back and watch episode one of Open Path.\nOr if you like dry humor and spreadsheets, check out Adam Steinfurth's full video about how to set up a spreadsheet to figure out what your company's open-source pledge commitment is.\nThanks so much for taking the time to watch this.\nYou can find me in the open source pledge Slack if you want to hang out.\nOtherwise, I'll see you in the next\n",
