  "cleanText": "Welcome to Syntax. Today we've got an episode for you on nextgen, upcoming, and coming very soon JavaScript features. So TC39 has a proposal stage where people will propose ideas to add to JavaScript, and they go through the different stages. And as they move along, some of them are stage zero. They're just wacky ideas that'll never happen. And then some of them are stage two. Two, 2.7, I guess, is a stage now. Three, four, and then we actually have them in the browser. So, there was last week, there's a whole bunch of new proposals that have moved forward and looking like they're going to make it. So, we're going to talk a little bit about what they are and where they would help you out and kind of what you can look forward to. Um, as well as like give you a chance to anytime any of these new features come out, you always get these guys that are like, \"Well, that API sucks,\" or \"Why do we need this?\" Now's your chance. Uh, you're a Y guy. Now's your chance to take part of the standards process and uh and and stop it before it's too late. So, uh, let's get on into it. Oh, I forgot to introduce you, Scott. How you doing, Scott?\n Oh, I'm a Y guy. Uh, no.\nI'm doing good, man. I've never heard of Y guy before. That's hilarious. I just made that up. Yeah.\n Oh, let me just tell you folks, we did a live show in Denver, and Wes was a part of a panel, and the guy could not stop coining new terms to the point where people were buying domains in the audience as he was talking. He was just like, \"We put we put uh chocolate on a pizza and call it pizza.\" And everybody's like, \"Oh, come on.\"\nThe other one fail backwards struggle backwards backwards.\n People are ask like the same question all the time is like should you learn the basics before you get into deep, and you know, and I was like, ah, I don't really believe that like like I learned jQuery and then I learned JavaScript. I learn a lot of people learn React and then they learn regular JavaScript, and a lot of people are now AI programming vibe coding, and then they're going to they're going to learn how to actually code properly um once they have that. And it's it's I I just off the top of my head I was like this called struggling backwards. Meaning that like you just get into it, and then you realize you hit a problem, and then you have to like struggle through it and learn how this stuff actually works. And everyone's like and then like the rest of the panelists are like, \"I really I really agree that you should struggle backwards,\" you know, and like I was like, \"Guys, I just I just made that up. That's not like a thing that we have.\" And then someone bought the domain name.\n Yeah.\nIt's crazy. There wasn't even another one too. I was I was just like I was in the audience, and I was just like, \"God, doing it again,\" and every time you you got called on for something, I was just like, \"That is a uh another term coin.\" So um\n Wes, your brain is fascinating to me.\nUh, yeah, also fascinating my website because it doesn't work very well because I'm not checking my errors enough on Sentry.io. Actually, that's not true. I do I check it all the time, and my website works absolutely fine because of that. The Sentry is it's the perfect place to to make sure that your application is working, and it does so in a wonderful way by really giving you all of the data. Um, there's even a neat AI feature that helps you fix the problems because you know that error logs and dumps can just be like can be a steamy dump. I'll tell you that. And uh Sentry allows you to click a button, and it allows you to parse that in a nice way. It allows you to then connect it to potentially logs or see exactly what happened in a session replay. We have an an error on the syntax site, Wes, that has happened 12 times a day for who knows how long because there's uh 20,000 events of this or 10 2,000 events of this.\n What what's there?\n Your credit balance is too low to access the anthropic API.\n Oh, shoot. We got to fix that. I know.\n Not 20,000. Oh, yeah. Actually, no. We have a cron.\nYeah, we have a cron. Bas the way that that works is every five minutes it checks if there's something that needs to be generated like a an AI summary, and then it pings the anthropic API. So it's it's probably happening every 5 minutes for it stopped working May 27th two weeks.\nOkay. So we probably have like eight shows that are getting pinged every 5 minutes, and something happened with the anthropic API.\n I think we either have to update it or the the card ran out or something.\n The card ran out. We also decided that those AI summaries were not very good cuz we have Randy now, and we're just going to stop putting the AI summaries in there because Ry's summaries are better.\n There's also a new feature in here in the this error which shout out to Sentry here cuz you know it's a cron job, like are you checking your logs to whatever to see if a crown job failed or passed? I mean, sure, you might notice it stopped working or something like that, but now we can see that this has happened 2,000 times since May 27th, and we can take care of it. There's also a new feature here called SER, which is in beta. It allows you to find the root cause of an issue, and you just click that find root cause button, and it's going to attempt to figure out what the root I have I have a feeling I know what the root cause of your credit balance is too low here, but there's some errors that I I don't think I'll be able to find that. So, shout out to Sentry on that. Head on over to sentry.iosynax.\nSign up with the coupon code tasty treat, all lowercase, all one word. Get two months for free. All right. TC39.\nAll right. So, we're going to go through all the different um proposals and and kind of where they're at. The first one we have here is uh import module with a defer on it. This is kind of interesting. So right now with a script tag, if you pop a defer on the script tag, what will happen is the browser will download the JavaScript from that tag, but it will wait until uh the end to actually go ahead and and execute it. And the proposal for module defer is that you can like I guess like if you're thinking about performance on a website, maybe we'll step back a bit. There's a couple things you can do to make your your app more performant, right? You can not download all of the uh JavaScript that is needed until you actually need it. That's like lazy loading, right? And you can dynamically require in JavaScript. But the the other part of JavaScript is not just loading or downloading the actual JavaScript. It's it's actually executing it. It's the browser needs to parse out the entire JavaScript so that it understands what the methods are and everything. And if there's any code that needs to be run right away when that thing is is required then or imported, then that will run. And that execution takes up CPU, and it can make your app slower. So we have immediate importing and immediate execution. That's just a regular import. We have lazy loading, which is a dynamic import. Um, and now we are going to get it at a stage 2.7, which is deferring the import, meaning that it will download it right away, but it will not execute it until you call or until you use that code inside of there. So simply just pop a defer on the import statement. So it's import defer whatever, and then you wait until it will the browser will simply just wait or the JavaScript runtime will simply wait until you actually need to use that code before it actually executes it, which can it can be expensive, like I've had some I've had some code like on a Cloudflare worker that took every time you instantiated the object it took quite a quite a long time, right? It turned out to be a bug, but if you have some very big code, you might not want that happening immediately on import. You might want to wait until you actually need it and if you ever actually end up needing it.\nYeah. And alongside that as well, there's another one for adding the deferred to reexports, which is when you import and export something in a single line. There's another proposal which will allow you to add the deferred value to those, but it's not really that it's you you'll need it, but it's not super interesting, so you won't spend any time on that.\n Yeah. By the way, if you if you do want to keep up on a lot of this stuff or or really if you're on Twitter, Rob Palmer, who you did mention here, Rob is a great follow for this. He's always tweeting out about whatever is going on. He's a co-chair of TC39 and uh he always whenever anything interesting is happening at TC39, he's posting it up. He's on on Blue Sky as well. So\n Oh, certainly a very good follow. And his profile photo is of one of my JavaScript exercises, I just realized. So I'm very happy about that.\nIn this guy or on Twitter?\n Uh on Twitter. Um, it's the like every single color, every single like named color in HTML. It's a screenshot from one of my exercises.\n Oh, I see his Oh, his not his his little not his avatar.\n No, no, no, no. That's not me. That's him.\n I was gonna say I How could this possibly be about colors? It's black and white. Next one here is the random random name space and functions. This one is stage zero uh championed by Tab Atkins, man. So the the general idea here is that uh let's even read this first paragraph.\nHistorically JS has offered a very simple API for randomness math.random which we've all used. It's a function that returns a random value of uniform distribution from now we know what random is.\nI love that the way these things are written um to be so formal. I'm such an informal person. The whole spec authoring thing is a is a world of its own.\n I know. I I asked uh I know this is stupid, but I asked Chad GBT to write Courtney a thank you for my salad in a formal way. And it was like, \"Dearest wife, thank you so much for this yummy salad.\" And I I did say you needed to use the word yummy in it. And she was like, \"Who wrote this? You didn't write this.\"\n Oh man. Yeah. Obviously chat GBT wrote it. It sounds the most chat GPT thing ever. Side note, double side note. Do you have people in your life that use chat GPT and text messages and emails, and it's like very bad in my kid's teacher just started writing her emails and like there's double emojis at the end of every sentence, and that's a dead giveaway. you the m dash everyone is a dead giveaway that you're using unfortunately cuz I'm a m dash enjoyer, I probably don't use the right ways but uh the double emoji in like a tweet or at the end of a sentence, it's a dead giveaway that you're using chat GBT to write it, and it's it's annoying um it's annoying so odd.\nIt makes more sense because you can just like do a quick bullet list of what needs to happen, and then they you feed it in, and it makes this like flowery email, but it's I feel like I can smell it a 100 miles away when when somebody's using AI to write these things.\n It's weird. I It's very weird. Yeah, I don't like getting them. All right, back to random. Random is a it it's most importantly a new name space for randomness within JavaScript. Random dot and there's 22 methods on there. 22 randomness things whi which is hey, that's pretty cool. So some either one of them is listed as random as the random method. So are you going to say random.random?\nYes. Well random.random is going to be the like existing random that we already have. It's not very exciting, but\n I just wondering if that's the way that\n Yeah.\nrandom.random super random. But the rest of them are for doing a random number between X and Y. Um a random number with a step. So you could say like give me a random number between two and three with a step of 0.1. It might give you 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. But there's also methods for random arrays. Um, so you can shuffle an array. You can grab a random item from an array. You can say, give me three items from this array and repeat them if if you hit them multiple times or or don't. Like I've done I've written that many times. You have a list of people's names. you want to grab three people, you shouldn't have the same person twice. Um, but then some cases, you do want it, right? So, it's taking that all into account. Random weighted where you can weight certain items more than others, which is kind of cool. There's a whole thing for random distribution.\nIt's It seems like the ultimate random toolkit, and I hate having to write that like simp even just random number between 10 and 40. That's such an annoying thing to have to go and grab a utility method for it or or whatnot. So, I'm very excited about this.\n I will say even like the even as as far as like the random uh the number method here, like you said having a step, but that like allows you to again have a step of potentially, you know, 01 or whatever or like int. Uh you can get a random int if you if you want to specify it as being an int or a big int. I like this random uh boolean returns a boolean.\n So you can get a random boolean, and it by default is weighted 50/50, but you can wait it you can weight it so it returns true more often than 70% of the time.\n Right.\nI that sounds great.\n Yeah. Yeah. That's it's it really has thought of everything. I went went through it. But I made examples for everything in here, and it really makes sense. It is not importantly, it is not cryptographically random.\n Mhm.\n Meaning that you should not use this for things like generating private keys or tokens or anything like that. There are web crypto APIs for that which use truly random algorithms that are much more computationally intensive. So if you need it for that, then then you should. Um, people are a little up in arms about it not being cryptographically random, but like man, I just got an array of names I need to shuffle.\n I don't necessarily I'm not using this to create passwords. The thing is that people are going to\n\n\nUse this to create random IDs or random passwords, and when you're, I don't know, putting out some new syntax token or something like that, it's going to be, you're going to get stolen from.\nYeah.\nOne thing that is nice about this is it does seem like it's very polyfillable.\nYes. Yeah. All of these methods are very polyfillable. So you could, once this moves forward, I certainly would not use it yet, but once it hits like a stage two or three or something like that, maybe we can start implementing this and bring it into your applications anytime you need to use a random API.\nYeah, I love it. One thing that comes along with this proposal is another proposal for a seeding algorithm. Um, and the idea with seeding something that is random is you want them to be predictably random every single time. So, if you've ever used like a FakerJS or any one of these APIs that creates random names or random cities and whatnot, when you're writing tests for those, you often need those values to be the same every single time because if there are random values every time, your tests would never pass. So, um, by seeding something with random, you'll know that you'll get the same value every single time that you call it. So if I call random.random, it's always going to, with a certain seed, it's always going to give me 0.4. Every single time that I call it in that instance, but then I call it again, it's going to give me that same number. So it's predictably random. Um, which in my case, I've only needed that for testing. Have you ever need predictably random in anything else?\nI guess if you need to be able to reproduce a list, if you need to reproduce a list without saving it, like say you have a list of names, you could save the seed.\nYeah.\nAnd then you could derive the random list the same way every single time without having to save the order of it. Yeah. It's a seed that you save.\nYou know what would make sense about that? Every year we do, you know, like football squares, and I have to do them like randomly. And since I'm the one doing them randomly, nobody trusts that I'm going to... Well, people trust me cuz I do it every year and I'm always fair about it. But like I want to have some verification that I didn't just pull these out of my ass. So, I just take like a screenshot of them after I do it. But like if you could share links with the seed, uh, that seed would provide proof that uh, that exists as a thing that we did.\nYes, you could share the seed.\nYeah, you... so you would randomly generate a seed, and then that seed would then be shareable, and then anybody else on their own accord could then derive the random values from that in the way that you're saying. So you load it as a parameter. Plus, there's probably no way for you to generate the seed because they're always long numbers. I mean, it would be tough to work backwards from a seed.\nYeah, I'm sure there's ways you could do it, but like, like I think about like Minecraft has seeds. So, like if you create a world that's really cool and you want somebody else to be able to then be able to create that same world on their own. So, it's not like you're joining the world, but it's like recreating it. They do that via a seed.\nOh, yeah.\nA lot of games use seeds in that way.\nInteresting. Yeah, I guess you could just come up with seeds until you found one that was your name first and then share that seed, of course.\nSo, the world is not totally solved yet.\nNext one we have here is Array.fromAsync. So, you know, Array.from will take an iterable. And let's take a sec for explaining an iterable. An iterable in JavaScript is a piece of data data structure that can be iterated over. It can be looped over, right? And obviously arrays are probably the most simple uh or the most common one. But uh there's many other types of data in JavaScript that can be looped over, right? You can loop over objects with a for of. You can loop over strings and get every single character. Uh Maps and Sets can be looped over. Node lists are, if you query selector or something, that's not an array, that's a node list. Um, and then probably the biggest one is like generators. If you have a generator function, you can loop over those, and every single time that you loop, you get the next item from the generator. So, iterables can also be asynchronous, meaning that you can await inside of them. And when you have any an asynchronous iterable, you sometimes want to simply just convert all of them into an array of their end values. And similar to how sometimes you want to simply wait for like Promise.all and wait for all of the items to be resolved. If you want to do them all in synchronously, if you want to asynchronously run them, but you want them to run in series, then you may want to use the Array.fromAsync. And what that will do is it will take an iterable which has async values in it, and then it will spit out just a straight up array of all the end values in there. So that will be a handy one. Not something I run into all of the time, but certainly in like tree walking, a lot of times in Node.js, you're doing directory traversal. You're searching for something. You don't necessarily know how many items there will be in that iterable because you haven't reached the end of it. That is a very handy use case for iterables and generators. And this Array.fromAsync will be nice and working with streams as well. I think this will be really helpful for as well. We're like, I don't care about every single hunk. I just give me the end piece of data that it comes out the other end.\nNeat.\nUpserts.\nWe've used upserts for many, many years. When have you used an upsert?\nUh, you know what? I use an upsert mostly in database stuff.\nYeah, right. Me too.\nAn upsert, what it does is it updates the record if it exists and it inserts it if it doesn't exist. That can save you doing a simple conditional saying, \"Does this thing exist? If it does, then do this, otherwise do this.\" So, an upsert can turn that into one line, which is uh typically how I'm using it. Some people don't like upserts, but I tend to... they don't bite me. I don't... I don't know why. I've never had them bite me. Yeah.\nSo much of my coding is simply checking if something exists, and if it exists, then I want to update it. And if it does not exist, I want to then create it with that value. So this proposal here is for adding upsert to Maps and WeakMaps. And the most common use case will be when you're like counting through items, and the first time that you encounter a key, like let's say you're looping over a list of clothing, and and you get shirt, shirt, pants, right? The first time you hit shirt, you check, have I started counting shirts yet? No. Okay, now create a key called shirt and set it to zero. Then you hit it again. Okay. Well, now it exists. So I'll grab the value out and then I'll increment it by one and then etcetera, etcetera, right? The method name here is called get or insert, which will basically say, get me this value, or if it is not there, then insert it, and the first or the second argument to the method is going to be the default value, and that will be... so many times you have to check if it's there. I do all this wacky shorthand to say like if it's there or not. So it's just another nice little one. It will not be added to arrays or no, arrays doesn't make sense. It's not added to objects, um, because you should probably be using a Map anytime you're doing any sort of dictionary or collection work. Maps are kind of underused, and I think one of the big reasons is because it's... you can't JSON stringify it without a like a custom stringify algorithm. But I'm a big fan of Maps.\nYeah. Uh, the next one here is clamp. Uh, I love... Wes has a note says, Scott, you love clamp and CSS. I do love clamp.\nScott's always clamping everything here and there.\nYeah, insert the... uh, I love lamp. I love clamp. Uh, for sure, clamp is wonderful. And what is clamp? And honestly, uh, which is very odd, I thought clamp was already in JavaScript. And it turns out I've always just been, uh, writing an implementation of it every single time. Or, uh, you know, clamp... clamp is in CSS before. We got clamp in CSS before we got it in JavaScript.\nYeah, you're right.\nIt's a function that constrains a value between an upper and a lower bound. So, basically, uh, typically it takes a number, it takes a minimum, and it takes a maximum. Um, in CSS these are in a different order, but hey, you take a number, a minimum, and a maximum. And what that does is say like, all right, uh, this can be useful if you have like an animation that needs to happen from 0 to 100. And you're providing it a value of 120 or something like that. And this is going to make sure it doesn't go above that upper bounds. And likewise, you go less than zero, it's going to return zero. So, it's going to keep it in between these two bounds. Yeah, this is endlessly useful for animations, um, for math. You see it a lot, and they say see the P5JS demo. You see it a lot in stuff like P5. Uh, again, when you're working with numbers and you need to constrain them to different times. So, uh, yeah, this this exists everywhere. There's a ton of userland implementations, right? There's clamp inside of uh, uh, low dash, 3JS, P5, Phaser, like anything like that uses clamp, and and I've written my own clamp a number of times because it's not... not that tough.\nMhm.\nIt's a oneliner, right?\nYeah. Now, we got uh, a clamp proposal in JavaScript, which is at stage two. And I think there's no reason why this shouldn't just be uh, just rocket shipped into JavaScript because...\nyeah, why do we need all these userland implementations of this when we got it even in CSS? A question I often get whenever I post about these things, specifically the random one, are people like, why do we need this? Like, why are we adding all this stuff to the language, and like, why not just import a module? In some cases with the clamp one, people will be like, why not just write a oneliner where it's like Math.max, and I hate writing oneliners. You have to have like a utils folder, you npm installed, like I have a oneliner npm package that's installed like a 100,000 times a week, and just because it's annoying to have to do that. Um, but with the like random one, if you're shuffling an array of 20,000 items, right? And I don't want to do that in JavaScript. You know who's very fast at moving around data pointers? The lower level uh APIs that the browser is written in. So certainly is a performance thing when you get into very large functions and and doing lots of complicated math in random land, and then simply things like clamp where it's a oneliner. It's just so much simpler to have it built right in, and like it... that's that seems like a standard standard lib thing that everyone, every language should have.\nIt's a low hanging fruit. It exists everywhere. Just give it to us in JavaScript.\nWhat else? CSS has clamp. C has glamp. C++, Rust, Kotlin, Dart, Ruby, Elm, Python. Does Python not have clamp? We got to beat Python out. No, there is no Python clamp.\nOh, yeah. We beat him out.\nWe beat him out. Take that, Python.\nTake that.\nYes.\nAll right, let's get into some Sick Picks and Shameless Plugs. I got a Sick Pick for you today, and that is a TV show that me and my wife have been loving: Clarkson's Farm, Jeremy Clarkson. Okay.\nHe's the guy from the car show with the Top Gear. The Brits are going to kill me that I had to even think about that. That's the car show.\nYeah. I actually started watching Top Gear after I watched Clarkson's Farm. I was like, \"Oh, this is actually pretty funny.\"\nYeah. I like Top Gear. Yeah. But Jeremy Clarkson is the guy from Top Gear, and he bought a farm in the Coxelds of Coxwells of um, the British countryside. It's beautiful, and like he's got animals, and he's starting up like a pub, and it's super interesting. The guy is absolutely like not dialed, but he's a lot smarter than he leads on, and it is extremely entertaining. So I would highly recommend it. I think it's on Amazon Prime is where we watch it.\nYeah, I have not seen... Yeah, I... I like him in general. I liked, like I said, uh, um, Top Gear, so maybe give them a go. We've been watching just absolutely trash TV lately. So, trash TV as a genre, I'm going to say.\nOkay. Like, like what?\nOh, man. Like, uh, Vanderpump Villa, which I gotta say, Hulu, it's on Hulu. Hulu sucks. It sucks. The apps suck. You pay for a service and then you got to watch 10,000 shitty ads. I was... we were... we were laughing that the ads are so bad on Hulu that Syntax could... they must be charging nothing for them because Syntax could could reasonably have a better ad on Hulu than any of the garbage that's on there. It is crazy. And they make you sit through so many of them, and we're paying for it. It is like it is absolutely wild.\nI got to put you on to Streamo. That's... that's all I'll say is is go check out Streamo cuz I... I'm the same with you. I... we pay for, I don't know, probably six or seven of these, Netflix and Disney and and Amazon Prime and Discovery, and freaking half the time I can't even find what I want or it's like covered in ads. So definitely check out Streamo. It's very good. It's like torrent streaming. It's like a Netflix experience with like a torrent back end. It's just instant. I will... I will check that out because if we got to see uh, The Secret Lives of\n\n\nMormon Wives and Vanderpump Villa and all this that's on Hulu, man, I cannot believe how bad the Hulu app is. No shade on the developers because I'm sure it is a bureaucracy thing, but like man, Netflix comparatively on the TV app, like you can't complain that the TV's underpowered or something like that because the Netflix app smokes it in every single regard. Netflix, shout out to Netflix for actually taking their engineering seriously. There was a guy at the meetup that worked on the Plex Player and he was telling us about what's built in JavaScript and what's native, and that's a very interesting world and seems like a very painful world to test on all of these random TVs that are $214 at Walmart, but you got to run a high performance 4K stream decoder on it. You know, I will tell you that Plex has got a much better app than Hulu does. So, shout out to Plex for doing what Hulu can't do with whatever their budget is. That's the end of the Hulu rant, folks.\n\nSick pick for me today is I got a four port charger. It is USBC in all regards and one of those ports does up to, I think maybe even more of them. I think two of them might do 140 watts. So, they have like one, yeah, 140 watt and then 140 watt and then a 40 watt and then a USB a normal USB on there. And this thing has, this is a charger with a screen. It's the Anker Max USB C charger for port multi-device fast charging advanced GAN power adapted intuitive tech controls for MacBook, iPhone 16 series, Samsung Galaxy Pixel and more. It's anchor. It's very nice. It has a little screen on it that shows you how much each device is drawing. It is awesome. So, I have this one which I sick ppic years ago. It's the Xino Pro. And whenever you're unsure if a device is charging or if it's charging fast enough or whatever, being able to see the actual draw on the thing, I have a couple cables that have it built in is so so key to tell if something is dead or not, especially if you like have like an iPad. I've fixed a few iPads in the past and by watching the wattage spike and go down, you can tell if it's if it's like shortcircuiting. So, that's so so good to be able to see the actual pull.\n\nYeah, that's great. You like that you don't even need to carry around a MacBook charger anymore if you have one of these. And they're smaller and they fits in your you just put it in your bag and you have charging for all your gear, including your laptop when you're traveling. This is specifically why I bought it.
