  "cleanText": "Welcome to Dialectic.\nEpisode 15 with D.A. Wallach.\nBefore we get into things, this episode is brought to you by Hampton.\nI think so much of company building is actually about energy.\nAs a leader and a founder, you have to be that energy source for almost everyone in your company, and so I think having people outside of your day-to-day context can be tremendously valuable in making sure that you yourself have the energy to keep going.\nThat's where Hampton comes in.\nIt's a private membership for founders and entrepreneurs that pairs you with a subset of like-minded leaders who you'll meet with monthly to talk through all of the challenges of building a company.\nIn a sense, Hampton is a one-stop shop to create a personal board of advisors, a group that you can go to for hard problems, feedback on challenges, or simply perspective that you have the energy to keep on going.\nI've certainly benefited from this type of peer mentorship in my career.\nAnd given how lonely being a founder can be, having a group of people that you trust that you can zoom out from the day to day with is such an incredible benefit.\nWhile the heart of the Hampton membership is your intimate eight-person peer group, Hampton also has monthly and quarterly events, online speaker series, a digital community for asking the entire network of over a thousand founders questions, and more.\nHampton isn't for everybody, but for founders who are on what can be both the thrill and joy of a lifetime in company building, but also an experience that can be quite lonely at times, it's an amazing way to have a community who gets what you're going through.\nIf you've raised $3 million or have $3 million in revenue, or you've sold a company for $10 million, I had strongly encourage you to check out Hampton.\nI've included a link in the description where you can learn more, and if you apply, make sure to tell them that I sent you.\nThanks again to Hampton for supporting Dialectic.\nNow onto D.A. Wallach.\nMost of the guests I've had on the show so far are polymaths of sorts.\nI've always been interested in people who seem to live multiple lives, and D.A. has done just that.\nThese days, he's a biotech investor focused on life sciences and healthcare at his firm Time BioVentures.\nWhile he focuses on bio and health today, he was previously a generalist investor and was an angel investor in SpaceX, Spotify, and Ripple, among others.\nBut here's where it gets interesting.\nHe in part got into investing by way of Spotify, where he was the first Artist-in-Residence.\nAnd the reason for that is that he began his career as a recording artist; that started when, as a student at Harvard, he and his band, Chester French, were discovered by Kanye West and Pharrell.\nD.A. went on to record multiple albums, tour with Lady Gaga and others, and record a solo album as well.\nBefore or after the episode, you can go listen to his music on Spotify or YouTube, but I'd specifically recommend his song Glowing on YouTube, where the music video is directed by Tyler, the Creator.\nThis conversation, like D.A., goes in lots of different directions, but I see him as someone who's fascinated with markets and systems, focused on actually making a pragmatic difference on modern healthcare, and who lets serendipity, curiosity, and beauty drive how he spends his time.\nSo we'll get into it.\nHere's D.A.\nOkay.\nD.A.!\nYessir.\nThank you for doing this.\nIt's my pleasure.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you, too.\nYeah, likewise.\nI wanna start with...\nThere...\nYou, you once said, I think on an interview, that your alma mater, Harvard, is a vocational school for investment banking and management consulting, and that you're suspicious of these types of institutions in the way that they tend to reproduce inequality, social hierarchy, and homogenize lots of talented young people.\nMeanwhile, you also, I think on the same interview, I think it was with Peter Attia, you said, \"I cold emailed him, which is how most things started in my life.\"\nAnd so my question is, how have curiosity and serendipity played a factor or a guiding role in your life?\nWow.\nWell, I'd say they're kinda like the, the two guiding factors, 'cause curiosity is, for me, the intrinsic motivation to pursue most things actively.\nAnd then serendipity is the kinda X-factor that...\nI mean, that's e- everything you, you can't control, right?\nSo your life ends up being this combination of things happening to you, which is sort of the serendipity part, and then you doing things that you wanna go do.\nAnd, uh, I generally wanna do is whatever I'm curious about.\nYeah.\nSo I never thought about it that way, but I guess those are kinda the two, the two, uh, weather vanes.\nWhen did you start cold emailing people?\nLast y- Are you still doing much of that?\nOh, yeah, I still...\nI cold email a lot.\nI probably started cold emailing people in high school.\n[laughs]\nAnd-\nProbably a good broad, um, pattern in, like, interesting people is like a high about...\nPeople are always talking about like, \"Oh, did you sell something in high school?\"\nYeah.\nBut the cold emailing thing is probably a pretty good marker too.\nYeah, I would do...\nI mean, I did a little bit of cold emailing in high school.\nThen it really took off in college.\nAnd when I was trying to get my music career going, that was when I did the most cold emailing-\n... probably, because the record business, I think even still, and probably less than it used to be, but it- it- that's, like, historically always been such a gatekeeper industry, where it's like, you know, almost everyone's story involves a, quote, \"big break\".\nMm-hmm.\nAnd that big break-\nRight\n... is just essentially someone responding to you, [laughs] you know?\n[laughs]\nSo you're...\nThere- there's really...\nThat's like the original cold calling-\nRight\n... game, because you just have to keep cold calling until somebody responds to you, and then when they do, that's your big break.\nYeah.\nSo that was definitely how we approached it, which was just, like, cold, you know, send our music to anyone who might be in a position where [laughs] they could open a door for us.\nYeah.\nAnd then that's been something I've always done, even since then.\nAnd, and, you know, now it's more of like, if I read something that, that was written by someone, where I think I'd like to talk to them or...\nNow, I also just try to send people emails if, uh, I really like what they're doing in the world, as- particularly even if there's, like, no agenda.\nLike, you know, if I don't wanna...\nI...\nYou know, if...\n'Cause it's like I'm, I'm such a fan of people [laughs] that I'll reach out to them just to say like, \"I'm a fan of what you're doing-\"\n... \"but I know there's nothing in it for me.\"\nLike, I...\nYou know, there's, there's no reason for you to spend time with me.\nThere's really no practical reason for me to spend time with you, but I just want you to know, like, what you're doing is great and-\nYeah, but you're also spinning the serendipity wheel there a little bit, right?\nYeah, you never know.\nYou never know what's gonna happen.\nAnd I will say, also, you know, there are some people who, like, this guy, Virgil Abloh, who was the designer at Louis Vuitton, I never met him in person.\nOr, maybe I met him once.\nI- I don't, I didn't have a relationship with him, but I think...\nI don't know if he was just like this or if it was just once he got cancer that he started doing this, but, like, I got...\nHe, he sent me a message at one point-\n... that was just a really sweet note about having loved my music.\nAnd it made my da- I mean, it was just...\nIt was so sweet.\nLike, you know what I mean?\nAnd I didn't know him, but I obviously knew who he was and I knew how important he was.\nSo that kinda motivated me to then do that more-\n... because I realized, you know...\nYou...\nI'm not saying this about myself, but it's like you...\nEven people who have gotten a lot of, lotta love from the world, a lot of them still, you know, have self-doubt, or they don't think that they're good, or they don't think that their work is good.\nAnd you, you just never know if you telling them that they're special or that their thing is great is gonna make the difference.\nHmm.\nSo-\nI like that a lot.\n... I now, I now try to do that a little.\nI think the other cool thing is there's, there's a little bit more of a consensus, at least maybe in technology circles or ambitious people circles, that when you're young, cold emailing is a really good thing to do.\nAnd I've always admired people who have a little more credibility or success behind them and still have that...\n'Cause, maybe to go back to the beginning of it, it's...\nIt feels like it's rooted in some kind of authentic curiosity more than unlocking some door or something like that.\nYeah.\nAnd, and, like, why...\nI don't know.\nIn a certain sense...\nI feel that there's one, there's like one kind of serendipity which is, you know, people go to conferences, people...\nYou know, people in business fucking love conferences.\n[laughs]\nAnd I really don't like conferences.\nI, I'm very uncomfortable at conferences.\nAnd the internet, though, is like the biggest conference ever.\nRight.\nYou know?\nLike, everyone is on it, and you can go and find, yeah, you can go find out what Jackson is into or...\nYou know, I mean, increasingly as people have been public, you see what they post.\nYou see what they're thinking.\nSo, at least to me, there's, there's such a great opportunity that affords you to only connect with the people who you already know you're curious about [laughs]-\n- Right\n... or interested in talking to.\nWhereas if you rely on these kind of older forms of serendipity, like going to a conference-\nRight.\nIt's like a scoped randomness.\nIt's, like, random.\nLike, I'm still gonna spin this serendipity wheel, but, like, I, I have it a little more honed in, and it's-\nRight\n... thus gonna be a little more likely to hit on something really cool.\nExactly.\nAnd whereas if you, if you're just totally open-ended and you go, \"Okay, I have the internet at my fingertips.\nI'm just gonna go trawl the internet for interesting people, interesting stuff,\" I mean, that's still kinda my favorite activity in a way.\nLike, you know, I mean, there's, there's something a little depressing about just being on the internet all the time.\n[laughs]\nBut I have to say, I've never gotten bored on the internet.\nI still, I can spend an unlimited amount of time-\n[laughs]\n... browsing the internet, so much so that I've actually thought it would be fun, you know, maybe not even just f- you know, for me.\nThis is a little solipsistic to say, but, like, I thought I could do a great performance art show where it was just me browsing the internet live.\nLike on Twitch or something?\nLike live streaming?\nThat'd be cool.\nActually, live streaming's not quite the-\nOh, you mean like in person on a stage?\nYeah.\nTwitch may, uh...\nYou're much more practical.\nLike, Twitch makes-\n[laughs]\nTwitch is-\nI kind of like the live in person.\nTwitch is in perfect buil- Yeah, I had envisioned it as a stage show.\nIt's like a keynote.\n[laughs]\nIt's like...\nYeah, but it's, like, in, like, a seated theater.\nRight, right, right.\n[laughs]\nAnd, but I thought, wow, this would be a great one-man show, but it's not the same every night.\nIt's literally-\nI'm in...\nI never know what's gonna happen.\n[laughs]\nAnd the audience doesn't know.\nI just-\nWe're gonna start on Twitter and just see what happens.\nI'm just gonna go on the internet and just-\n[laughs]\n... see where I go, because I always find it really interesting and entertainment, entertaining.\nAnd I've always thought, \"I wonder how good I am at this.\"\nMm.\nYou know?\nLike, obviously there is no competitive forum for web browsing.\nBut, like-\nGeoGuessr's kinda close.\nWhat is it?\nGeoGuessr.\nDo you know about this?\nNo.\nWhat do you do?\nOh.\nThere' s, there's this guy Rainbolt, and he's, like, the best in the world at GeoGuessr, which is this game where you get, like, a, a s- picture from Google Earth of somewhere in the world, and you have to guess.\nLike, you have to put a pin on a map of how close you are to the thing.\nAnd this guy Rainbolt is, like, within five kilometers-\nWow\n... every single time.\nBut that's, even that's a little more scoped than just-\nThat's incredible\n... pure browsing.\nYeah, that's a very narrow skill.\nI mean, he sounds like a savant.\nHe's on TikTok.\nHe's like, he crushes, yeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, in my show, what I think would make it entertaining is that when I'm browsing, there are a lot of things going on.\nRight, right, right.\nYou know, I'm watching some videos, I'm doing some-\n[laughs]\n... Twitter, but I'm also finding obscure websites.\nSure.\nI don't know.\nI just, I love the internet.\nI love browsing it.\nI, I totally agree.\nJust, just surfing the web.\nSurfing the web, man.\nUm-\nThe original surfing.\n[laughs]\nIt's before, before physical surfing was cool.\nRight, right.\nSpeaking of maybe the curiosity part of it, you've talked in a few different contexts about what I would describe as sort of this fun, curiosity-driven orientation versus this, like, work ethic, grind orientation.\nYou've said you don't love practicing.\nI think that was specifically in the context of drumming.\nThere's another excerpt.\nYou say, \"I really thought I'd try to get into Berklee and seriously try to become a great jazz drummer.\nI suppose that I've always lacked the discipline and practice ethic that's\n\n\nRequired for that.\nI had to learn over time the bolts in the art I make and in life.\nI have to turn being a dilettante into a strength.\nI'm not the guy who's gonna shoot 10,000 free throws until I'm Michael Jordan.\nIt did happen kind of accidentally that I said, \"Okay, yeah, I'll try singing.\"\nBut the process of being an artist in the world was so compelling because of the freedom it gives you.\nI feel that way about everything I do, not just music.\nI want the ethic of being independent and open-minded, having a lot of integrity intellectually to be part of anything I do.\"\nAnd so maybe I'm reaching here, but it feels like you've very much continued with the spirit of that, that last bit, regardless of the domain.\nAnd whether it's investing broadly, or science and bio and medicine now, you're clearly very curiosity driven, but you also have, at least from what I can tell, a pretty remarkable ability to go deep.\nAnd you might call yourself, like, a dilettante, but, like, I, from what I've read and heard and heard about you, you have a kind of a radical amount of depth, at least in certain contexts.\nSo, I'm curious how you balance that energy we were just talking about, the surfing the web, pure explore energy, with the ability to exploit and say, \"I'm actually gonna get really rigorous.\"\nI think the rigorous part, there's a level of depth I can get to where I don't need new skills.\nYou know, which is basically to say using just language and conceptual thinking.\nYou can understand a lot of molecular biology, for example, you know, which is an area I spent time on in the past decade.\nWhere I start to feel that tension with my sort of dilettante inner child is when you then need to actually learn a new skill.\nMm-hmm.\nSo, I'll give you an example.\nRight now, I'm really interested in statistics, which was a subject I hated in, uh, high school, which was the only time I took it.\nAnd then, through my interest in investing and, and, and in particular, in systematic quantitative investing, which is something I've been curious about for the past few years, I realized there are basic concepts that are used constantly that I never really got.\nSo, for example, I don't actually know what a standard deviation is.\n[laughs]\nYou know?\nLike, what... Just, like, what, what is that?\nMm-hmm.\nAnd so, I was recommended by this really cool statistics professor at Stanford to get this old stats textbook that's been around for 30 years or whatever, and I bought it.\nIt's a great textbook, and it's super well-written 'cause it's... It's, you know, there are no pretentions.\nIt's made to walk someone from knowing nothing through all the basic concepts.\nAnd so, I'm really enjoying that, but it's... I have trouble pushing myself to do the problem sets.\n[laughs]\nYou know what I mean?\nIt's like, it's... I love reading the chapter.\nAnd then, okay, I know, for me to really internalize this sort of deeply-\nSort of like the, the, the scales or whatever in the musical context.\nYeah.\nNow, I need to do 10 of them.\nRight.\nAnd it's kinda like, when I feel like I got it, I'm n- I'm not gonna-\nOkay... do the 10.\nYou know?\nAnd I, and I'm always kind of... I've had this...\nI don't know if it's been deliberate or, or accidental, but I've had this privilege of working, um, in my music career and now in my investing career with collaborators who are super deep technically.\nMm-hmm.\nSo, like my bandmate, Max in Chester French is really a prodigy musician and can play every instrument and write string arrangements by hand.\nAnd, you know, like, that's kind of a crutch for me.\nT- it's good.\nI mean, it's, it's, it's complementary skills-\nRight, right... is a different way of putting it.\nRight.\nBut I'm always sort of in awe of people who can do the thing I can't, which is this kind of relentless, deep focus.\nAnd probably actually enjoy getting really, really up close to that.\nThey love... Yeah, yeah.\nThey, they love it.\nYou know, like their happy place is doing that all day.\nAnd I, I get it and I admire it, and I... Part of me wishes I were like that, but I'm not.\nSo, the best I can do is kinda work with people like that.\nBut then when you do, they also raise your game.\nSo, you, you know what I mean?\nYou, you go from being totally non-technical to being, like, much more seeming... You know, when you say, like, \"Oh, it seems like you have depth or something,\" let's say, in, in biology.\nLike, you know, I have de facto ended up knowing a lot of biology, but not nearly as much as people who that's all they do, but much more than, like, I did when I was a generalist investor.\nRight.\nOn that theme, you've talked about sort of this inclination towards understanding the skeleton or the structure or maybe the whole of the thing, rather than, in the bio context, memorizable facts or even just in any context, like really, really up and close with all of the details.\nAnd I think maybe part- it's particularly interesting in, in life sciences, biology because most people associate those things with their high school experience at this, like, rote m- minutia.\nSomebody you've referenced as a particular influence, I think you started reading maybe like early on tour as a musician is E.O. Wilson.\nAnd I'd love for you to talk a little bit about... I, I haven't read Consilience, but I have, like, a basic understanding of Consilience by Reduction.\nAnd I'd be curious for you to contrast what seems like a notion that's built around sort of, like, compressing really big ideas from top to bottom, to reduce them down to these, like, really, really simple theories, usually it seems like physics.\nAnd so, you have that on one side, but you also have, like, complexity theory and some of the Santa Fe stuff and emergence in these ideas that actually feel like it's... They get wider over time, not narrower over time.\nAre those two ideas actually in tension?\nAm I misreading that?\nLike, in hindsight, maybe I think you first read Wilson in maybe 20 years ago or 15 years ago.\nHave your views on that type of stuff changed?\n'Cause again, you seem, as you were just getting at, you seem like somebody who's really coming at all this stuff trying to understand the whole rather than trying to reduce.\nI think that's a reasonable characterization of my goal.\nAnd what E.O. Wilson was writing about in that book, Consilience in particular, is the idea that nature is one continuous entity.\nYou know, so, like, these boundaries that we draw epistemically between molecular biology and sociology and anthropology, you can think of those as-... metaphorically be kind of, uh, horizontal or vertical divisions.\nSo East Asian studies, you know, or as a, as a field, so to speak, in academia, is like everything about East Asia, right?\nLike, every part of culture and history and whatever, and like, that's sort of a vertical division.\nA vertical slice, right?\nAnd the horizontal slice is, you know, something like anthropology where it's like, \"Oh, we're gonna look laterally across all of these different cultures and try to find common characteristics of social behavior and organization.\"\nAnd EO Wilson's point was, reality doesn't have any of these divisions.\nThose are all lines that we've drawn-\nTop-down.\nYeah, because we think it's gonna make it more tractable to understand something we're curious about, but we might be wrong about that.\nMm-hmm.\nIn other words, the best way to understand two things that seem unrelated in our taxonomy might be to have a different taxonomy.\nSo I do aspire to understand as much as I can about how reality works, and I do think you get a lot out of trying to blur those disciplinary boundaries, or you can even start to get at the truth by just spending some time in each of those disciplines.\nHmm.\nAnd then, you kind of organically see where they overlap and bleed into each other.\nPart of the idea, at least as I sort of understand it very basically, is that he's trying to reduce at almost every level of abstraction.\nAnd, and basically, like, almost all, like, the, the super smooth brain version of it is like, most things are up, uh, downstream of physics basically.\nLike, or physics at least resolves into all of these other things.\nOne of the things, there was, there was something I read from you a while ago that was sort of talking about come- initially coming at sort of trying to understand the world through a lot of humanities related stuff.\nPolitics and sociology and even anthropology.\nAnd, and one of the things that was so attractive both about that book and, and moving into bio and, and life sciences was this notion that our current systems and models are actually just way better at explaining life sciences than these other things.\nAnd part of my question is do we just not have enough rigor that high up the abstraction or is something else happening there?\nLike, I, I guess what I'm wrestling with is do we just need to spend more time in physics and ke- and chemistry and bio to, to, to eventually understand that or is actually like something else happening here?\nThis is, this is w- what I'm, and maybe I'm forcing this, this is what I'm trying to connect into this sort of like complexity science Santa Fe stuff-\nYeah... is that emergent seems to run kind of perpendicular to the EO Wilson stuff to me.\nBut maybe I, maybe I'm not connecting.\nI'd have to go reread EO Wilson-\nYeah... to, to know how at odds his view was with that.\nI mean, what I remember striking me about that book was just his insistence that we strive for integrative theories-\nHmm... across-\nGot it... you know, what people in complexity world call scales of organization or levels of organization.\nRight.\nRight.\nAnd all that's meant by that is, you know, it, you can describe things at the level of subatomic particles and then-\nYeah... atoms and then molecules and then organisms and then ecosystems and societies and-\nSort of like paste layers.\nIt's-\nYeah, sure.\nIt's like, you know, as you go up in this metaphorical way of thinking about the world, what you are doing at each scale is you're defining what an individual is.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd then the theories are about how individuals interact with each other at each scale.\nRight.\nRight?\nSo at the subatomic physics level you're trying to have theories that accurately describe the interactions of subatomic particles.\nAnd then at the atomic scale you have basic chemistry.\nYou know, how do these atoms interact with each other?\nWhat are the ways that they bind and react and how do they form aggregates and how do those aggregates interact?\nAnd then so on and so forth.\nWhen you get, by the time you get up to, you know, uh, human cities, you need theories of how buildings relate to people, relate to companies, relate to apartment co-ops.\nSo he's saying, like, these are all sort of, if you take a lateral kind of understanding across a lot of these things, you can actually move up those ladders of abstraction and still have like some semblance of the same theory.\nWell, he's saying they should, they should connect.\nThey should-\nRight.\nThey should, there should be a sort of clear connection between each, each layer of the cake.\nMm-hmm.\nSo if we have a theory of evolutionary biology and genetic variation and heritability, that should connect with our theory of psychology, for example.\nAnd so, you know, this stuff is hotly contested, but EO Wilson was among those who were involved in so-called evolutionary psychology-\n... as a field, right?\nAnd like that in and of itself was meant to be a new field that bridges-\nCool... the theory of evolution with psychology-\nRight, right, right... and tries to ground-... observable human psychological traits in evolutionary selection pressures.\nNow, any of these things can be overdone, and I think you're getting at a really interesting and, and fundamental question, which is are the theories that we need to explain what happens at a particular layer just endemic to that layer alone?\nRight, right, right.\nAnd that is kind of, in some sense, the premise of what's done at Santa Fe Institute or what t- you know, people are chasing with complexity science, which is, wouldn't it be nice to have quantitative predictive theories of how a city works or how a market works?\nAnd what is enticing about that is that as of now, we just don't have theories like that.\nSo on the one hand, we've got what appear to be highly reliable theories for Newtonian scale physics, right?\nI mean, we can predict when I throw a baseball exactly where it's gonna go, and it's gonna do that every time with very little variation.\nBut if we want to predict what's gonna happen to a company, which is say what venture capitalists do, or we wanna predict what's gonna happen to the US economy, nobody has a, a formula-\nRight... that does that reliably.\nI mean, there are a million people telling a story about what's gonna happen and-\nYeah, it's just a compute problem or whatever.\n[laughs]\nUh, we have no idea.\nRight.\nI mean, we just don't know how it works-\nRight... basically, and so anyways, yeah, I've said enough.\nIt's cool.\nOne of the things that I'm interest- m- maybe to start with, y- you seem very interested in complex systems and you've spent time working in a few of them.\nBefore we get into that, any just like broad reflections, I don't know how long you've been involved, but broad reflections on what makes Santa Fe... I think Santa Fe is like a pretty underdiscussed, but a whole bunch of really smart interesting people are involved.\nI'd, I'd be curious what you think makes that place unique or special.\nSanta Fe Institute I think is very special because it's really the birthplace of so-called complexity science, but that is complexity science as such called complexity science.\nHmm.\nAnd recently, I was watching Ken Burns and he d- Ken Burns did the Da Vinci.\nCool.\nIt's like a\n\n\nThree-part Da Vinci documentary.\nAnd, um, watching that you go, \"Well, Da Vinci was doing complexity science.\"\nHe was, that's exactly what he was doing.\nAh.\nHe was... And, and basically so were a lot of scientists for most of history before science was institutionalized in the way it has been in the past, I don't know, 200 years where all of these very strict disciplinary boundaries have been formed and-\nBut labels all, maybe to Santa Fe's credit, like labels are really helpful as shelling points.\nI guess my, my, uh, intuitive frame here would be that something like the label of complexity science gives more people like agency in this domain to like think about it more explicitly, uh-\nWell, what-\n... even if the taxonomy isn't perfect.\nYeah, I think what it's meant to do is it's meant to give scientists permission to explore questions that are not native to their subspecialty or their sub-subspecialty.\nRight, right.\nAnd by contrast, you know, for the most part if you're at a big university today, the exact opposite is discouraged, right?\nI mean, how do you get a celebrated, you know, dissertation and then get a job?\nIt's like be super narrow.\nNarrow, narrow, narrow.\nAnd so the Santa Fe Institute on the one hand, I mean, it's got this kinda brand of, uh, you know, really smart people and, I mean, like these t- like these issues that Santa Fe Institute deals in are the things that you hear the Collison guys talk about and Charlie Munger t- Like, it's like there's an aesthetic of like smart interdisciplinary peripatetic thinkers love this stuff, and that's true.\nBut I actually think that what's cool about it is almost the opposite of that, which is that it enables this much more innocent and open-minded type of science which is people who are just willing to go back to very basic questions about the nature of reality.\nAnd it's not just the theoretical physicists who are permitted to do that at Santa Fe.\nYeah, yeah.\nAnd, and then part of the formula is letting people who are really smart and experienced in one area interact with people in another area.\nAnd again, I th- like my perception, I'm not a scientist, I'm not a part of those technical meetings that happen at Santa Fe, but I think my impression is a lot of it is like let people ask dumb questions about fields they're not a part of and it tends to unlock new routes of inquiry.\nAnd-\nYeah, permission's a really powerful idea, I think, probably in these, in these types of things.\nAnd briefly, a little bit too earlier, you have spent your career inside of like two very complex... Complex might even be a nice way of putting it, like some people might just say like bad, messy, complicated systems, or at the very least bureaucratic systems in, in terms of the music industry and then now healthcare and medicine.\nYou mentioned it earlier, you're clearly also just broadly interested in markets.\nYou could be an investor in plenty of different contexts.\nLike, do you think there's a reason you're attracted to these high complexity, you could call them like hard mode areas?\nYou know, I've never thought about that and I, if anything, wish that they weren't like that.\n[laughs]\nI mean, I, meaning I didn't, I did not-\nYou didn't choose them because they were hard?\nI did not choose them because they were hard, and I wish they weren't hard.\nAnd it's frustrating that they have that quality.\nAnd so, I resent it.\nYou have written a, especially recently, quite a bit about trying to sort of, like, structurally resolve some of those problems in, in medicine and in healthcare.\nAnd specifically wrote about this, like, zero-toll medicine idea recently.\nI guess a two-part question.\nOne, what goes into designing good systems, especially if they're complex?\nAnd two, is it actually realistic to imagine a world where you can either hot swap or actually replace an existing structurally entrenched system?\nLike, you, you outlay in, in zero-toll medicine specifically, you outlay this, like, kind of, like, beautiful theory of like, \"If you could start anew, here's how a great system could look.\"\nBut also, you're trying to layer it onto, like, the most endemically bureaucratic system ever.\nAnd so is that like... I'm curious how you think about that broadly into what goes into actually, like, designing a new system that's really productive or good.\nAnd obviously, you don't need to give us all of the answers in a podcast, but-\nI, Geez, I, I'll tell you, I wish I knew.\nI'm a little insecure about whether putting out an idea like the zero-toll medicine thing is worthwhile.\nHmm.\nBecause it's, to your, to, yeah, I mean, embedded in your question is just the truth that it's like, this isn't gonna happen.\nYou know, like, I'm, I'm-\nRight\n... writing an idea about, \"Okay, here's how I think the healthcare system should work.\"\nAn ideal world, right.\nYeah, here's this ideal world.\nI mean, it's basically science fiction.\n[laughs]\nGranted, like most things in crypto.\n[laughs]\nYeah, so it's like, that's just like me giving a science fiction idea of our healthcare system.\nMm.\nExcept what's not science fiction about it is like, you don't need any new technology.\nLike-\nRight.\nWe actually could do this today.\nYeah.\nAll we would need to do is agree.\nA benevolent dictator, yeah, yeah, that's it.\n[laughs]\nYeah, just like America and all of the people in it who are at odds with each other's interests-\n[laughs]\n... we just need to agree, \"Yes, D.A.'s idea is perfect, let's do it.\"\nYeah.\nAnd so, uh, you know, I, I try to voice that because at least it suggests that something that I, uh, believe would be better, it could happen.\nYou know?\nWe don't need a ton of new technology.\nWe don't need a crazy design.\nNo.\nRight.\nAnd people, I'm not like a, I wouldn't identify as some kinda strong socialist, but socialists I've heard say that it's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism.\n[laughs]\nAnd it's a re- kind of poignant thought, because obviously, it should be much easier to imagine the end of any manmade creation than it is to imagine the apocalypse.\nRight.\nBut there's some, when you hear that formulated that way, you kinda go, \"Yeah, that is true.\"\nLike, it, it, I, I can't imagine capitalism being over.\nRight.\nAnd similarly, it's like, wow, can you even imagine our healthcare system not being horrible?\nAnd I think the one heartening thing is that it's not like the world has one healthcare system, you know?\nThere are a lot of different countries, they all try different things, there, there are new countries that pop up and old countries go away.\nCountries aren't even that old of a thing.\nRight, right.\nRight?\nI mean-\nLots of renewal happening, that allows for opportunities to kinda, like, wedge in new ideas.\nExactly.\nI mean, I don't wanna go, we don't need to go into a whole historical thing, but it's like when the, um, Israel-Palestine War broke out, my partner and I were reading all this stuff about, uh, the end of the Ottoman Empire, and basically, what the seeds of the whole Israeli conflict were.\nAnd when you read that you go like, \"Wow, it wasn't that long ago.\"\nAnd in the backdrop of that was the emergence of the nation state as an idea.\nAnd then you've got, like, Balaji and people like this writing about the network state trying to create it, trying to come up with new ideas.\nAnd, you know, on the one hand, that stuff sounds a little fanciful and I don't know that network states are gonna be the thing.\nBut it's not crazy, by any means, to imagine that the system we have right now, uh, won't change.\nI mean, it's almost definitely gonna change in various ways.\nAnd by that, I mean, you can see the dissolution of nations, you can see the, uh, global order emerging that might just be a network of big, powerful cities, or, or various other... I mean, there are a million different ways you could imagine it playing out.\nAnd so the healthcare system might end up being completely different.\nHmm.\nAnd therefore, why not brainstorm?\nYou, you know?\nAnd if, if I can, like, also, what I was trying to do with that piece in particular was just make a very logical case that insurance companies don't do anything valuable.\n[laughs]\nEh, because I, even myself being an investor in this industry, it's like you get so well-adjusted to the idea that all of the things that are a part of it should be.\nYeah.\nYou know, like, oh yeah, like, of course, like, we, we need to come up with all this technology to help insurance companies do what they... It's like-\n... but why, why do we need these insurance companies?\nIt's like seeing the water a little bit of, just like-\nYeah\n... what are the super for granted, yeah.\nHmm.\nYeah, like they literally don't do anything worth, like-\n... why do we have them?\nHmm.\nShouldn't we just get rid of them?\nLike, you know, I think Obama should've oriented Obamacare around getting rid of the insurance companies.\nMm.\nMaybe.\nMm.\nBut the next person could do that.\nYeah.\nI mean, Donald Trump could've dec- you know, I don't know.\nI, part of me was thinking, \"Wow, there are all these crazy people coming into government right now.\"\n[laughs]\n\"I'll write a thing that maybe some of them will read.\"\n[laughs]\nYeah.\n[laughs]\nNot-\nAnd, and they'll be, like, insane enough to try this.\nNot that cra- I mean, they're trying, they're trying stuff.\nI like the sci-fi metaphor too because in, at its best, sci-fi is like, it's not about the future.\nIt's about, like, helping people see the present through a new set of, through a new lens.\nAnd so hopefully in your case, both a, like, drastically different thing that also might be directionally where we can go.\nYou, you talked about capitalism.\nYou, you clearly are someone who's very interested in markets.\nI'm curious why they are energizing or interesting to you.\nMarkets have just kinda always intrigued me as a subset of, you know, the eco- broader economy.\nAnd I got seeded with this interest in economics in high school when I, I had this, uh, hobby thing.\nIt was like my, my, one of my extracurriculars in high school [laughs] was this thing called Fed Challenge.\nOkay.\nWhich was basically a competition sponsored by the Federal Reserve, where high school kids on teams, uh, have to...\nBa- basically the, the competition is your team, which is like four or five people, pres- does like a 20-minute presentation.\nAnd it's like your overview of the current state of the macro economy in the United States, and then your policy recommendations to the Fed.\nWow.\nDoes it still exist?\nI don't know if it still exists.\nHuh.\nBut it was awesome.\nLike, I mean-\nCool\n... for me it was awesome.\nAnd it really framed how I still think about the economy.\nAnd I don't know, there's something cool about just that exercise in looking at data and trying to figure out what's going on.\nMm.\nAnd putting it together in a coherent narrative that then, you know, in this case, making policy recommendations, you can, like, act on.\nMm-hmm.\nSo as I've, you know, gotten older and then gotten interested in different, you know, styles of investing, in different asset classes and parts of the market, that's always in the background.\nJust this idea of, like, the markets are both a part of and happening in the context of the broader economy.\nAnd you can start by just situating yourself broadly as, like, \"Where are we in the economic cycles?\nWhere are we in the credit cycle?\nWhere are we in the innovation cycles?\nOr are these things even cyclical?\nOr are they just evolving, patternless kind of phenomena?\"\nAnd, and then-\nIt goes back to emergence.\nYeah.\nLike, once you, once you have set the stage in that way, how does it bear on the narrow part of the market that you're looking at?\nMm-hmm.\nAnd so as an example, I kinda relish being in the midst of a very crazy challenging moment in life sciences markets, and being able to vacillate between a sort of macro view and then a micro view.\nAnd it goes back to what we were talking about before.\nIt's like, how do you connect these different scales?\nBecause you'll hear people telling a story about what's going on in biotech, for example.\nLike, the biotech mar- in the, the public markets, biotech has been in the tank for, like, four years.\nIt's just brutal.\nAnd so people who are just in biotech, you know, they may come up with stories that are more in the terms of the science, or what's going on specifically with particular investment firms or something.\nIt's a kind of micro view.\nAnd, but then if you, like, zoom out, you go, \"Oh, actually, this is like, 80% of this is just about interest rates.\"\n[laughs]\nOr whatever.\nI'm not saying that's some, like, brilliant insight.\nI mean, people know that.\nBut I don't know, that, that perspective that you gain from zooming in and out and trying to fit the puzzle pieces together is just really interesting to me.\nAnd partly because I don't know that you ever get certainty.\nIt's, you know, I mean, if you...\nLike, I- I've got a bit of a, w- what do you call it, like a guilty pleasure of listening to, ya know, CNBC kinda stuff, or like- [laughs] podcasts that are just, like, macro talk.\nAnd I- I'm\n\n\nI'm always thinking when I'm listening to those things. I'm like, \"Am I actually, like, getting anything out of...\" [laughs] \"Like, am I learning anything? Or is this just, like, a really perverted style of entertainment... that I'm drawn to?\"\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Like, I just, like, hear, like, my, my family makes this joke with me of, like, \"Oh, you know, there, there's, there's Dad again, listening to old men talk.\" [laughs] And, and, like, my kids will always be like... Child, not kids. My child will always be harassing me about, like, \"Dad, are you just gonna go listen to old men talk?\" [laughs] And it's kinda shameful. [laughs]\n\nWhat makes a good investor? Or what have you learned about investing?\n\nWhat have I learned about investing? Hmm. Well, it's definitely multifaceted. And what makes it interesting, again, is that you're trying to build a composite view by going pretty deep on a bunch of individual pieces, none of which is sufficient on its own. No certainty either, to back to your earlier point.\n\nYeah. I mean, even, yeah, even, e- like, you know, what you're gonna do is you're gonna look at all of these facets of an opportunity. You're gonna look at the management team, and you're gonna look at the financials, and you're gonna learn about the market, and you're gonna try and project sales and things in the future, and then you're going to try to estimate the probability of different scenarios.\n\nMm-hmm. And each of these component exercises is highly error-prone. So at the end of it, you hopefully come to a conclusion about whether you should do something or not. And then, what's tough about venture capital, that a lot of people have pointed out, is you don't find out if you're right or wrong for quite a while.\n\nNow, I will say, you can find out you're wrong sooner [laughs] than a long time. And- And also, rightness is a huge gradient. Huge gradient. And also, you know, like, of course, things can fail for reasons that you didn't see, but things can also succeed for reasons that you didn't see.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And then- Is it, is it beta or alpha?\n\nYeah, and do you, do you like... Uh, yeah, basically beta or alpha, and then, like, also, you know, are you a genius to have invested in Amazon because you love bookstores, you know, or, or, like, did you get lucky? Because, like, the bookstore idea was great, but it wasn't Amazon.\n\nRight, right. You know? Yeah, it could've been Barnes & Noble, right?\n\nLike, you do hear venture investors, I think, often remark that it's all about the people. And so, sure, I think that's true, but also, what do you do with that? Like, are you [laughs] di-... Let's say, okay, I- I agree. I've learned it's all about people. [laughs] Should I, should I not, um, care about the- [laughs] ... idea? Like, you know, should we not hire an IP lawyer to find out if this is actually patented? Right. Should we not do any of the other diligence that we always do? So, it's not all about the people. Ev- You know, there is someth-... Like, the, I- I guess the people are definitely necessary, but not sufficient, but then other things are also the, w- the, the other things are not necessary and also not sufficient. So, the people are maybe the only thing that is necessary.\n\nHmm. Everything else is maybe necessary and, and maybe sufficient or, and not, certainly not sufficient.\n\nHmm, interesting. This goes a little bit back to something you were talking about a few minutes ago, which is that so much of markets is, like, trying to see reality clearly, and, and obviously investing within that context. Um, but there are plenty of investors who just, all they actually care about is seeing reality as it is and capitalizing on that. You seem to have a more creative or generative approach to it. Obviously, venture capital, by definition, as an asset class, is a little bit that way.\n\nThere's a quote from you. You say, \"The reason...\" And I think this was many years ago, but you say, \"The reason I invest in technology is it's the only work humans do that is actually creative. All other types of economic activity are just moving money from one pool to another, whereas technology is what allows us to create value out of thin air. There's something about that that is really conciliate with art. It seems like, for an hour of my time there, I can produce a lot more impact.\" And I'm curious, within the investing theme, why is investing specifically the right domain or orientation for you to act in this kind of creative phase of your life? You, you could be building biotech companies or, or doing something totally different. It seems like the creativity is clearly the theme, but you're doing, you're drawn to investing for some reason.\n\nI like the creative stuff for sure, but I'm not sure how naturally talented I would be at building companies. So, I've often thought of it as sort of the record producer phase of my life. Hmm. You know, where, like, when I was making music, I was, like, the, obviously the artist. But then in this phase, the entrepreneurs are the artist, and I'm more like a producer. And so, I- I- I like the leverage that it affords you, because you don't have to just do one thing, right? You know, I get to sit across all of these companies and all these talented people. So, that's interesting. The intellectual challenge of, of security selection, diligence, and all that is interesting. I'd say where I hope to be more creative as an investor is in trying to innovate on the investing process itself, and I'd love to innovate the off-... Like, I- I'd love to innovate on the market structure in some way.\n\nHmm. Uh, um, um, I haven't done that, by any means, but that's a goal of mine, creatively. You know, as we're talking about the geopolitical order evolving throughout history, music evolving throughout history, biology evolving throughout history, so too has the asset management business.\n\nHmm. And if you look at the past 40 years, the most exciting thing is the index fund. You know, that's such a, that was such a creative innovation. And there's this great book that Robin Wigglesworth wrote, Trillions, I think it's called- Right ... which is about the index fund, the rise of the index fund. And so, I don't know a ton about him, honestly, but, like, in principle, Jack Bogle's definitely one of my heroes. And I love what he did, because, you know, he combined a sort of brilliant investing insight-... with creating a product that has done a huge amount of good for everyday people who are trying to hold on to as much of their wealth as they can.\n\nMmm. Mmm. And on the one hand, venture capitalists, because it's, you know, people say, \"Oh, venture's a access class-\" Mmm. \"... not an asset class.\" Yeah. And, like, what they mean by that is, it's all about, like, what deals can you get into, you know? Like, my friend Josh Kushner can get into the hottest deals in the world. Like, you want OpenAI, give Josh money. He's like... He's right in there. Yeah. He gets... Put all the money into OpenAI. And, uh, that in a way is what the- the venture capitalists do. So for a venture capitalist, the marketing that people often do is, is oriented around how great they are for the companies they invest in. So it's all like, \"I'm so founder friendly and I'm so awesome. I add so much value, da, da, da, da.\" And I kind of am skeptical of that. And I'm gonna get back to Jack Bogle in a second, but I'm sort of skeptical of that because at- at least my intuition is that the best entrepreneurs don't really need very much from their investors. It doesn't matter who they get the money from, they really just need money. And like, yes, I'm sure, you know, whoever you have on your board might have moved the needle on this or that thing at some point, but you know, if you said, \"I just wanna invest in the... Truly the absolute best entrepreneurs in the world,\" they don't need anything other than money.\n\nElon's not talking about his investors very much. [laughs] He's not. So it's ... a good example ... when I was starting my firm, he and I had dinner and I said, I said, \"Look, I wanna start a firm. Tell me, from all of your great experience, like with investors or whatever, like what, what do you need from investors? What makes a great investor?\" And he was like, \"Money.\" [laughs] I mean, he was like, not being- [laughs] I mean, I don't... I forget exactly what he said, but he was like, \"Not being annoying.\" Right. Or whatever. Coming from the best capital raiser in the history of the world. Very good. Yeah.\n\nSo that is just to say, I think it's kinda BS, this whole like, \"Ooh, we're all about the entrepreneur.\" Like, your customer, as an investor, is the people whose money you're managing. Mm-hmm. And I know that it can feel less noble to be managing money for some pension fund or whatever. I mean, we can not e- We don't even need to get into the merits of who you're managing money for. But let me just say, if what Jack Bogle did was give the index fund an access to low cost, highly diversified equity investing to, you know, a billion people, that is a huge good for the world. Because people work their whole lives, and I'm, I mean, pension recipients obviously too as well, [laughs] so managing pension money is really important. Maybe university, I don't know. D- if you think universities are corrupt or whatever, then maybe that's bad. Or, you know, hospitals. Whoever, you know? You don't like. Yeah. Whatever institution you don't like, sure, okay, managing their money, who cares? But I don't view it that way. I mean, I think it's like, you know, helping people preserve capital, particularly if they're people who really need that money- [laughs] ... like, to retire on.\n\nMmm. The goal of the industry should be to constantly do a better job of that- ... for people. And so- It's subversive though, because so much of what it seems on the external piece of it, and the marketing around it, and now, uh, all of that is that your customer's the entrepreneur. And so there's like a little bit of a dotted line there that I think... I, I, I think most entrepreneurs don't think at all about who's... Even where the money's come, coming from, which is an interesting sort of like misdirection in all of this.\n\nTotally. And I just think it's... I, I think the whole thing is... I mean, we're just talking about venture here. I think the whole thing is better when it's transparent and straightforward. Mmm. And I always tell entrepreneurs, I'm like, \"Look. It's... This is not my money. You know? This is other people, who have worked their whole lives to make this money, have entrusted me to go and find the best risk adjusted returns in- ... healthcare.\" Mmm. \"And that's what we're doing. We think your company is one of those. And here's what our incentives are.\" Let's be commercial together. Right. Yeah. And it's not like, yeah, like, we're... I- I'm not using that as cover to be like needlessly ruthless or something, but I just think it's just being honest. Mmm. Here's what my incentives are. Here's what I'm trying to do to do a good job. Totally. And if the company performs in this way, then I will have done a great job for our customers. And if the company doesn't perform in that way, then here are the things we're gonna need to be thinking about to try and mitigate a disaster. [laughs]\n\nHmm. It's a really... It's a refreshingly different take. I also just broadly li- the idea of, the idea of challenging these... Again, like seeing the water, like challenging these baseline defaults of mechanisms that haven't always been there... I was talking with some friends last week about, like, how the, the employee stock op- option plan is, like, kind of what actually enabled startups in venture capital. And even that, like, showed up in like this 40s or 50s, I think? Mmm. And so it's, it's... Yeah, it's cool. I mean, it all resolves all the way back up to the sci-fi discussion and, and zero toll medicine. Like, are there things that we can actually like... Oh, these things are just totally locked in? Maybe not. Uh, uh- Yeah, and I think ven- I mean, e- venture now is gonna change. Yeah. Private market investing is changing. The nature of securitization with things like crypto may change. So going back to the earlier discussion, what excites me is-... thinking about how we can potentially innovate on the investment products as we're investing in a market that, in and of itself, is fascinating. Right. Right. Life sciences and healthcare. Right. So you've got change in the themes that you're investing in, but then you've also got change in the asset management business itself.\n\nYeah, yeah, the meta game of it. And that's where we wanna- ... innovate, is, uh, we wanna be an innovator in the asset management business. Mm-hmm. So that's where I, you know, after 15-minute cul-de-sac here, that's where I envision having an opportunity to be creative.\n\nCool. I like that a lot. Speaking in the context of kind of like creative pe- you, you likened technologists to being sort of the most creative part of the economy. There's a, an old bit you have where you say, \"For most scientists, like most artists, the point of it all is the work itself, the song or\n\n\nThe discovery or the technology, yet in both cases the importance or power of that creative accomplishment is amplified by commercialization.\nWhat's the point of your great idea if it never gets to listeners or patients?\"\nAnd obviously, we're not also gonna solve this today, commerce and creativity are kind of like always sitting in tension, but are there any patterns that you've noticed throughout your life or, or more recently as an investor, in the creative people, again whether they're in the art context or, or more solidly in the science and tech context, of creative people who are good at commercializing or at least have an attunement to commercializing stuff?\nI think the commercialization or promotion [laughs] part is, uh, it's doing, you know?\nSo, like the creative part can be just thinking.\nOh, especially in science.\nYou know?\nYeah, and then, I mean, then there is like a d- there's, there's a sort of intermediate doing, which is like doing the experiment, writing the song, recording the record, shooting the movie, whatever, but then there's this follow through, which is a lot more doing.\nAnd I think you kind of have to have a love of that too.\nHmm.\nAnd, and not everyone has the love of both.\nMm-hmm.\nBecause you can love making the music, but then you hate being on stage or you hate doing interviews or you hate doing photo shoots or like, like I-\nYou hate raising money.\nYou hate selling customers.\nYeah, oh yeah, like I love investing but I hate raising money.\n[laughs]\nWell, it's like, well that's, but that's not...\nThe job, like a lot of that job, is raising money, so it's, you, it's these people who really like both.\nMm-hmm.\nIt's, and it's, it's very hard in general to compete with people who like doing the thing.\nHmm.\nIf you don't like it and they like it-\nYeah\n... good luck competing [laughs] with them.\nThere's this amazing anecdote, uh, that my friend Graham Duncan highlighted about Novak Djokovic in Financial Times.\nI don't know if you've seen this, but he's, it's like, \"How do you go on playing at this level for so long?\"\nAnd he's just like, \"I like hitting the tennis ball.\"\nYeah.\nAnd they're like, \"What do you mean?\nEverybody likes that.\"\n[laughs]\nAnd he's like, \"No, watch them.\nYou can tell.\"\nThat's, uh...\nAnd I, and I d- and I, I, one, I love Graham, but two, I...\nThis substantive thing is maybe, that, that also maybe gets at the two, at the thinking and the intermediate doing and then the doing doing.\nThere are also people who just love that last mile.\nThey just love the market.\nMm-hmm.\nThey just love conferences.\nThey just love TED Talks.\nE- and-\n[laughs]\n... and you know, they just love-\nPodcasts, heaven forbid.\nYeah, they just love podcasts.\nThey don't read.\nThey, and I don't like that culture.\nMm-hmm.\nI really don't like that.\nRight.\nThat kinda superficial culture, which is, in a lot of ways, it's just an extension of, of gossip magazines.\nMm-hmm.\nYou know, it's, it's might nominally be a science, you know, might nominally be about science, but it's really just about talking about people.\nRight, right, right, right.\nAnd who's doing what and who's dating who and who's starting a company with who.\nAnd there are investors who are like that.\nIt's just all about the, the social drama and the w- what's hot right now, and I, I hate that.\nYeah.\nAnd I would, I describe that stuff as unsubstantive versus what I'm calling the substance, which is like, do you really love the music?\nDo you really love the process of discovering a new molecule?\nDo you really find material sciences genuinely interesting to you?\nSome of this is like, where do you get your dopamine?\nI, and part of what you're describing is these people who are actually like enamored with the full end-to-end of the process, 'cause by the way, most people sort of tend to one end of that.\nAnd if you're getting your dopamine from anything other than like making something and selling it or whatever permutation of that, you're probably likely to skew towards one end of the thing.\nYeah, that might be.\nThere's, there's also a sort of the, the, what I'm calling substantive part is kinda more insular.\nMm-hmm.\nIt's, it's, you know, you're, to use your phrase, you're like getting your dopamine from discovery or creation and then the other part is kind of inherently social.\nIt's, it's all about other pe- you know, on the one hand, yes, you want people to hear your music or watch your movie, but I think that's kind of inextricably linked with wanting to hear everyone tell you how great you are.\n[laughs]\nOh wow, you're such a genius and that song's so brilliant and you're-\nBut there's people who only, to your earlier point, like...... or to, to, to use a different analogy we were talking about at the front, like, there's people who are really good at surfing the internet, and then there's people who are really good at surfing the internet and commercializing it as an investor.\n[laughs]\nAnd-\nRight\n... [laughs] you actually kind of do need...\nAre there plenty of people who, who like to do some aspect of the creative thing, but when it comes to, to...\nWhich is why I kind of think, like, it's almost like your dopamine being linked to the full feedback loop versus one slice of it.\nYeah, I, it's, it's, it's kind of like, you know, you could write the greatest song ever, and then the question is, are you satisfied with that?\nYou know, do you-\n... listen to it and go, \"Wow, I did it.\"\n[laughs]\n\"Done.\"\nOr do you feel like, \"Okay, I think I did it.\nNow I need a bunch of social confirmation in order to sleep at night\"?\nAnd, I mean, a lot of artists and a lot of business people have that psychology, which is they're kinda narcissistic and they're very insecure, and so, yeah, they're sort of like, they have that internal fire to make the stuff, but that's not enough.\nThey need, they need everyone to tell them how great they are, and that drives them through that last mile.\nMm-hmm.\nYeah, it's like different kinds of fuel.\nOne, um, it's a little bit in the weeds, but one thing you've talked about in the context of investing in, in health and biotech is this notion that you're kind of like more excited by older technologies, like things that are a little bit more lindy.\nUh, you said, \"I love gene and cell therapy, but to me those are brand new technologies.\nThey're very intellectually exciting, but also risky to invest in.\"\nI'm specif-\nAnd this is sort of just selfish 'cause I, I feel like I was hearing about it so much until maybe more recently, is like gene editing and CRISPR specifically, is like, uh, it's funny, I j- actually just saw Paul Graham tweet about this, where he was, it was like s- I don't know, all the gene editing companies are down like crazy the last few years.\nAnd his contention was, were, I don't know, it's like the 2000s internet stock bubble.\nI'm curious maybe if there's anything broadly on that note of like how, how to think about the why now for an emerging technology.\nAnd then two, just curious if you have any actual specific perspective on the, on the gene editing stuff.\nIs, it, it, it, it very much feels like the, the future is like unevenly distributed from the outside looking in, but it's also pretty opaque to me and I suspect a lot of people, of like a thing that could just be the most important technology of our lives, but I heard about, a lot about it in 2015, and now I, I guess it's boring or not progressing fast enough.\nIt's starting to have some success stories in human clinical trials-\nOkay\n... r- very recently, like the past couple months.\nHuh.\nAnd that's really cool.\nBut it is still very early technology.\nSo-\nWhat is early technology in biological sciences?\nOr does it depend on the context?\nIf you think about developing a new drug, there are many different dimensions of risk, so I'll just mention a few.\nOne, what organ, tissue, system in the body are you trying to affect?\nSo let's say you're trying to fix literally a broken heart, you know, like [laughs] you're trying to fix, you know, thickening of the cardiac tissue.\nHmm.\nSo you have to figure out how to get the medicine to the heart specifically.\nNow, you also have to think about where else it's gonna go.\nMm-hmm.\nSo if that medicine is also gonna hit a bunch of other parts of the body, you gotta be sure it's not gonna screw them up.\nAnd it might screw them up by doing the exact s- thing that you want them to do in the heart.\nHmm.\nBut you only really want that to happen in the heart.\nYou don't want it to happen everywhere else.\nSo you have to think about delivering to the right place.\nYou have to think about the drug actually working when it gets there.\nYou have to be cognizant of all the other places it could go and the damage it could be, it could do there.\nYou have to figure out how much you need to give to affect the right level of activity and how long you need to be giving that amount of the drug.\nYou have to think about the patient's immune system and the way that it will react to the drug.\nIs the body gonna mount an immune response to this and generate, say, anti-drug antibodies that then neutralize the effect of the medicine?\nYou have to think about how much it's gonna cost to manufacture the drug.\nIs that going to be commercially viable?\nYou have to think about how much the US government will pay for that drug and what the economists are going to conclude when they think about the economic impact of everyone paying for that drug to treat this disease versus paying less for a slightly worse drug, but one that may have significant enough benefits that the cost-benefit favors that one.\nSo anyways, I'm just giving you a sense of-\nComplex systems\n... how many dimensions there are.\nYes.\nAnd so, I mean, I always refer to this metaphor of, you know, when you're playing like a fighting video game and, you know, you scroll through the, the-\n[laughs]\n... the characters and you see all the bars?\nYeah, yeah.\nWell, it's like, so every drug has like its own s-\nYeah, it's like a player card.\nYou know, it's got its own set of bars, right?\nRight.\nFor all the different criteria.\nAnd, you know, it's, it's a very challenging science.\nSo, all of that is to say that when you have a brand new technology like DNA editing, the technology, until you have tried it in people a bunch of times, is fundamentally a big question mark.\nIs this gonna work in people?\nEven if it works in monkeys and everything else, still, is it gonna work?\nIs it gonna cause a problem?\nThat's just the foundational technology.\nAnd on top of that, you have all of those other component risks.\nAnd gene editing is a type of technology that's also like going at a very low level of abstraction, relative to maybe a antibiotic or something.\nThat's right.\nAnd in particular, one thing it's doing is it's potentially permanently editing the DNA.\nSo in principle, it may be irreversible.\nMm.\nSo if it does the wrong thing, it could pose a huge risk and it could, you know, let's say, let's say that CRISPR goes and puts a mutation in the wrong place and it gives the person cancer.\nYeah.\nHow many people do we need to test it in to know that it doesn't do that in one out of 5,000 patients?\nRight.\nBecause if this becomes a mainstream heart disease medication, it's gonna be given to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people.\nSo you can't afford for it to give cancer to one out of every 5,000.\nBut let's say your first human clinical trial is a hundred people or 20 people and it works beautifully in all of them.\nHow do you know whether you've mitigated that risk of it giving people cancer or not?\n'Cause the incidence is much lower than you would be able to ascertain in that small study.\nSo-\nLindiness is good here, is the idea.\nWell, it's just you are...\nIf you're just trying to make money as an investor in new drugs, your goal is to mitigate as many of the risks as possible and to kind of isolate what's the bet you're making?\nGot it.\nYou know, the more that the bet you're making can be isolated to one-\nIt's narrow\n... question, the better.\nBecause then you just need to be right or wrong about that.\nBut when you have a brand new technology like CRISPR being explored as a human drug, you've got a bunch of question marks that you're having to deal with all at the same time.\nI'm glad people take that risk, but it's definitely more risky.\nAnd that's why you can look at technologies like antibodies or bispecific antibodies that have been around for 30 years, and they've already been tested in so many different contexts with so many different patients that you've put to bed a lot of those risks.\nAnd now if your idea is we wanna try an antibody drug against a target that we've never gone after-\nGot it\n... well, now that's a narrow risk.\nYou know, you know all the other things have ha- you can, you can sort of take for granted, and now it's just this one narrow question.\nSomething like GLP-1s, I don't know anything, I'm, I'm a total layman here.\nSeem like they kind of come out of nowhere conversely.\nHave they actually just been around way longer than I realized?\nIs it that it's actually far more scoped and narrow and less complex than something like CRISPR?\nHow does a drug like that kind of go from, again, it's the classic future's here, not evenly distributed yet, or, or, um, suddenly and then gra- gradually then suddenly.\nHow would you comp something like that?\nWhich just, again, like three years ago, never heard of it.\nNow, it...\nAnd, and not to mention, it, it doesn't just seemingly solve obesity, but it seems like it's maybe the miracle drug for everything.\nSo\n\n\nThat's a great example of the gradually then suddenly thing.\nGot it.\nAnd I say that because this was kinda percolating in big pharma companies for over a decade.\nGot it.\nAnd there's a longer history behind it too.\nLike, you know, we actually make GLP-1 naturally, and it's something your body secretes that has a physiological function in normal, healthy people.\nThe original idea was, \"Oh, maybe we can have a synthetic version of it.\"\nAnd I believe the original molecule was derived from the Gila monster venom.\nIt's a fun story.\nI mean, it's like-\n[laughs]\n... be- because the human version of GLP-1 has an incredibly short half-life.\nAh.\nSo it's not... You couldn't just make the human version of it that we make in our bodies and use it as a drug, because the drug would have such a short half-life.\nMm.\nIt's basically not a drug.\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nAnd so they found this Gila monster venom contained a sort of similar molecule, but its structure gave it a longer half-life.\nAnd so that was like the first version, but it also didn't have all the properties that would be ideal for a anti-obesity drug.\nIt got developed for a long time as a diabetes product.\nAnd one of the challenges was that if you gave people the drug at a therapeutic dose, meaning at a dose that would likely be biologically effective, then they would get really sick.\nAnd it took years to figure out that you could basically step people up on dosage to get them to tolerate a therapeutically relevant dose.\nSo now when people start on GLP-1 drugs, they are stepped up over the course of weeks or a couple months to the actual target dose.\nGot it.\nBecause that avoids them getting this like severe nausea and GI issues and whatever.\nSo it's a fascinating story because I don't think people who were working on it knew how big it would be.\nAnother thing that's interesting is that it didn't come from like a startup biotech company.\nIt came from inside of big pharma.\nAnd there's an interesting dimension to that, which is that perhaps they had a longer duration of capital and therefore an ability to take a longer duration of risk than even the venture capitalists in biotech.\nMm.\nAnd so that gave them the attention span and the runway-\nDo the slow build.\nExactly.\nHmm.\nHmm.\nYeah, and maybe one kind of obvious conclusion here, and you talked through some of this, is also just like CRISPR got a lot of headlines, and we see this in other parts of technology too.\nGot a lot of headlines probably well before, because of how substantial it was, well before it was anywhere near... In 2015, it was probably the very beginnings of just, like, the science side, let alone the medical side.\nAnd I think that's a broader phenomena.\nI have a theory, which is that in the '90s when the internet kinda got popping, every business person was so caught off guard by it.\nAnd then you had this, like, decade plus of, like, every company just, like, hiring a, quote, \"IT guy\" to, like, figure out, oh, like, \"What should we do with the internet?\"\nRight.\nAnd I think that was a sort of traumatic collective experience for a whole generation of Baby Boomers.\nOh.\nAnd then in the past 20 years, these internet companies made people so rich.\nAnd then, like, people, like, in my gen- like, millennials, like me, we saw people our age become billionaires at-\nRight, right\n... 22.\nRight, right, right, right.\nAnd everyone was so envious of that, that I think the Baby Boomers and the Millennials together vowed to never ever let this happen again.\n[laughs]\nWe will never be caught by a technology that exceeds our expectations.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd so the way that that has been accommodated is now anytime there's a whiff of an important innovation, people way overdo it.\nRight.\nAnd it's, it's much more than even like when people talk about...\nWhen people compare AI to, like, building out fiber optic networks and stuff like this for the internet.\nIt's, like, it goes way beyond that.\nThis is like people going crazy over CRISPR when it comes out, people going crazy over crypto when it comes out, now AI.\nWe also have the tools to speculate now more, more, um, explicitly and way m- with many more scale and all these things.\nThat's right.\nIt's interesting though you... This also rhymes with, um, I haven't read it yet, but the... Byrne Hobart's new book.\nI think it's part of, part of what he seems to be arguing is that this phenomenon that you just described, maybe it's amplified now, but it's actually like a pretty important part of these technologies, like, fully diffusing, which is interesting.\nLike, the bubble is actually sort of part of the, the necessary, um, gravity well to get enough interesting people to work on it.\nSo it's f- I don't know.\nI, like-\nYeah, that could totally be.\nAnd I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.\nI mean, I think, I think it's great for the technology and it's probably great for the world.\nHmm.\nI'm not sure it's great for the first investors.\n[laughs]\nFair.\nYou've taken a... We talked a- already talked a bit about the zero-toll medicine stuff.\nIt seems broadly that you are taking a very, like, market-like incentives design approach to a lot of aspects of health and healthcare.\nYou, you align where you say, \"Zero-toll medicine would engage each citizen as a stakeholder in the healthcare cost of the entire society, and could provide direct incentives for individuals to proactively be involved.\"\nAnd, uh, somewhere else you said l- like, a literally simple example, \"A patient gets money for curing herself at a lower than average cost.\"\nSo, there's this one view that's like, healthcare and medicine, that it's structurally about individual incentives which really, I think, interesting, and relies on sort of the shape of markets.\nAnd then you also elsewhere kind of ack- acknowledged more of a slightly socialist kind of top-down view.\nYou s- you say, \"Put patients in control of their own healthcare spending, eliminate vast amounts of administrative cost and complexity, and drive far more efficient market-based competitive pricing.\nIt is rooted in libertarian and socialist idealism alike, exploiting the virtues of decentralized decision-making and markets while realizing the civilized goal of healthcare as a fundamental right of American citizenship.\"\nObviously, healthcare itself, like, is... The, the system is sort of sitting in this tension.\nBut I think that last part, in particular, sounds quite paradoxical to me.\nAnd maybe this goes back to, like, I'm just trying to paint, like, an idealistic future, but do you think that that type of tension can really exi- like, can we actually get the full kind of free market version that also assumes this world, but says everyone should have healthcare?\nI think the socialist part of it is just a question of who pays for healthcare.\nHmm.\nOkay.\nAnd so my strong commitment there is that, let's all insure each other.\nWhen we're born, we have no idea how sick or healthy we're gonna be throughout our lives.\nOne thing that we do know is we're all born effectively disabled and dependent, and most of us in the later years of our life are disabled and dependent.\nAnd so...\nAnd, and no one gets out alive.\nSo, I think it's a wise and ethical decision for us to socialize the costs of taking care of each other.\nAnd, yeah-\nImmediately, people's response to that might, though, be then you run into trouble around individual incentives, which is part, part of so much of what you're suggesting, and so it s- seems interesting as a, again, as a layperson who doesn't fully com- understand the complexity of this stuff, is that more o- individual ownership and more individual incentives feel really good, but it, it seems like in conflict with what you just said.\nWell, today, we have a system where we socialize about 50% of medical costs in our country.\nOkay.\nI'm arguing that we should socialize, if not 100%, 80%, 90%.\nBut right now, we've already agreed, uh, in America, we're gonna share about 50% of the costs with each other.\nThen the question becomes, how do we get the best bang for our buck?\nRight, right, right, right.\nAnd that, I believe, is answered by the individual alignment of incentives.\nToday, you've got a system where if I've got back pain and I get referred to an orthopedic specialist, that physician's economic incentive is to do surgery on me, whether or not that's really what I need.\nYup.\nAnd that surgery is very expensive.\nAnd to the extent that 50%-\n'Cause they get paid, by the way, when they do the surgery.\nThey get paid when they do surgery.\nSo it would be much better if I actually had a reason besides aversion to surgery-\n[laughs]\n... to understand what my treatment options are, what the likely outcomes of those options are, and what the costs of those options are.\nAnd then, as an informed adult, to be able to make the choice that's best for me.\nAnd in general, the choice that is best for the patient is also likely to be the choice that's best for the costs that the society is sharing.\nNow, there are some complicated edge cases here.\nIn particular, end of life care is a very challenging one because what we tend to do in America is we perform surgeries and expensive treatments on people until the day they die.\nSo people who have terminal illnesses and for whom extensive treatment to the bitter end is going to lead to a very low quality of life, w- we tend to still treat those people intensively because medicine lives in this kind of paradigm of wanting to fix, wanting to save.\nWe incentivize that on some levels.\nAnd, and we've incentivized it.\nRight.\nRight?\nI mean, everyone involved is gonna make much more money-\nRight\n... treating this cancer patient an extra five times until the end of their life.\nAnd when you look at doctors themselves and the choices that they make about their own care at the end of life, a fascinating fact is that they choose much less care because they know what it entails.\nMm-hmm.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd they know what the quality of life is gonna be like.\nAnd they go, \"You know what?\nI'd rather not get another surgery.\"\nAnd that's just a product of knowledge.\nThat's a product of knowledge.\nE- even b- even maybe upstream of incentives, it's just, like, actually understanding what's going on.\nVersus most people, by the way, you, you're playing into an incentivized system that has more care and you're fearful and you're like, you have un- unknown unknowns.\nYou're just like, \"I guess I'll opt in.\"\nRight.\nI mean, you're terrified.\nRight.\nBecause it's terrifying to be a patient.\nAnd honestly, one of the, I think, major shifts in the philosophy of medicine that we hopefully are in the midst of is, we're moving out of a long history of paternalism where the physician is basically like a religious leader.\nRight.\nRight, right.\n[laughs]\nAnd what the-\nHas a special title.\nY- yeah.\nAnd, and what the patient has been taught to do is submit to the doctor.\nHmm.\nAlmost to the point where you'll hear phys- patients say things like, \"I don't even wanna know.\nLike, I, I don't need to know the...\"\nLike, oh, \"I don't need to know the-\"\nYeah, they're delegating understanding.\nThe, yeah, because it's, it feels like a relief to just defer to someone.\n\"Oh, Doctor, you, I'll just trust you and you just make all the choices for me,\" and that's the least stressful thing.\nRight.\nBut I actually think ac- I think for many more people than we assume, eh, being empowered with transparent knowledge is much more reassuring.\nAnd that's certainly true...\nI mean, it's easy for me to say as a, you know, this kinda medical nerd control freak.\nBut I would, I would argue the LLM, LLM stuff is showing this, starting to show this.\nI think it is because people go on there and they wanna know what's going on, they wanna know the truth.\nAnd it's not perfect, but the LLMs are increasingly, you know, outperforming real physicians in not only medical knowledge provision, but also in, quote, \"bedside manner.\"\nAnd so we are, without exaggeration, truly in the early innings of, uh, the era of AI doctors, free high quality medical knowledge for every person on Earth.\nThis is, I think, without question, you know, maybe the biggest thing that's ever happened to medicine from the time that it started.\nWow.\nAnd medicine, I, I, I give talks about this, like, medicine started as a total BS-\nWitchcraft\n... phony-\nYeah.\nWitchcraft.\nIt was not a real thing.\nIt was a fake science.\nAnd amazingly, over time, it has actually started to merge with actual science [laughs] and become a more fact and evidence-based human activity.\nAnd now, embodying medical knowledge in machines, in computers, is the next big step.\nAnd it's actually gonna be much better for patients because one of the great afflictions of this era and of all medicine up until now is there's so much variability in the knowledge of the people who are providing medical care.\nAnd so it's completely unfair to folks who don't have access to the best doctors, that they get a far inferior style of medicine.\nGiven that we haven't had AI to date, what we've tried to do is we've tried to educate physicians in a machine-like way to think in a machine-like manner, [laughs] and to calculate probabilities in a rigorous and consistent way, to follow, um, treatment algorithms in a consistent way.\nBut we all know computers are better at being computers than people are.\nMm-hmm.\nMm-hmm.\nYeah, I l- I'm really fascinated by the notion that perhaps even I've heard, you've heard the statistics about whatever the, the AI doctor is better, the, um, human or even the human plus the AI.\nIt's interesting to imagine a world where something about that interface is actually implicitly causing the patient to take more agency and ownership, perhaps because it's less paternalistic or something, that submission p- psychology.\nAnd it's not the doctor's fault necessarily.\nUh, it could be.\nThat's real- You, you started to talk about it, and you've written extensively about\n\n\nIt, if people are more interested in going super in the weeds, but broadly, this idea of the universal standard of care, evidence-based medicine.\nAnd you've talked too about this idea of streaming medicine and kind of like an almost like an open kind of global database that has more standardization as you were just getting at.\nIf you were to try to distill that into... What is the most important domino to fall towards getting us a little bit closer to that?\nIs it this LLM stuff?\nIs it something else?\nIs it an education problem?\nIs it a system problem?\nObviously, it's super complex and it's gonna take a really long time, but I'm curious if there's anything that you're feeling the heat.\nYeah, I think it, I think it has partially happened already with the LLMs.\nThere's a ways to go in terms of figuring out how they fit into the practice of medicine, or maybe even how the practice of medicine fits into them, which might be the right way to think about it.\nSo, you know, what the gen one efforts are trying to do is they're saying, \"Okay, you know, what does it mean for hospitals and doctors to just start using auto transcription software?\"\nAnd then you put some AI in the software and it kinda error corrects or suggests things for the doctor to ask, but it's really superimposing this like incredibly radical, disruptive technology over the clunky, old bad system.\nAnd so-\nMm-hmm.\nTranscription's a nice Trojan horse though.\nIt is a nice Trojan horse, and it's, it's working, you know?\nAnd it... The reason it's working, by the way, is that physicians hate having to fill out notes-\nRight.\n[laughs]\n... at the end of the day.\nRight.\n[laughs]\nSo they spend a lot of time doing that.\nSo it's like it solves their pain point.\nBut if you really want to build the model of the future, it doesn't start with the existing doctor's office and the existing nature of a medical visit.\nMm-hmm.\nIt's gonna be a totally new experience, and I think we just need to keep de-risking the LLMs or whatever they evolve into such that we can be confident that not only are they able to deliver the right answer to very specific questions given a set of inputs, but that they can be incorporated into a more interactive process with the patient.\nSo there's this Bayesian thing that happens when a doctor is diagnosing someone, which is the doctor has to figure out what's the next piece of information that is going to most rapidly advance the diagnosis.\nAnd so if you go to ChatGPT, it's like, yeah, great, if I go to ChatGPT and I'm like give it my MRI file and my whole patient history and, you know, whatever else I've got, it's like supposed to in one response just interpret all of that and tell me what's going on.\nBut, like, the way it will really work is, \"Oh, I've got this, like, rash.\"\nYou know?\nAnd then the AI needs to ask you another question.\nAnd then at some point it's gonna say, \"Oh, I... What, what's this blood marker value?\"\nMm-hmm.\nAnd then you're gonna need to go and get that blood test and come back-\nThat's the gap\n... and give the blood test to the LLM.\nSo that's a iterative, interactive process with the patient that involves acquiring information not just through a chat.\nIt requires potentially imaging, um, molecular diagnostics and other inputs.\nAnd so we gotta figure out how it gets productized in a way that accommodates all that.\nRight.\nYeah, those friction points are usually where you have churn in the process too.\nHmm.\nYou said I think in a Nick Bilton interview for a while ago, you said the last 50 years have been about computers networking.\nThe next 50 are gonna be about playing with living systems in a deterministic way.\nWe're on the verge, if not in the middle of an intelligence explosion that obviously people are kind of losing their minds over.\nAnd it's artificial intelligence, whatever that means.\nUm, that's a, that can be a loaded word.\nSometimes it's a word we skip over.\nThere's also a notion of...\nLike, people like Nery Oxman have talked about this idea of sort of like a natural intelligence.\nYou, you have this line that I thought was cool that I think was more almost in a spiritual context, but you had, I think you had told Nick, \"The universe is unfolding in a particular direction, and it selects for things that help it get there, wherever it is trying to go, and it tends to discard things that stand in the way of that.\"\nDo you think... Is your sense...\nAnd again, you can take this in a scientific-ish way or a totally non-scientific-ish way.\nDo you think there is a difference between the artiti- artificial intelligence we found ourselves developing and this sort of natural, slower, wiser universe intelligence?\nOr are those kind of the same thing?\nIs it worth trying to distinguish between the two?\nThis stuff's very high minded.\nUh-\n[laughs]\n... the... Again, these, these quotes you keep, uh, resurfacing feel very serious.\nHuh.\nUh, I don't know that I could give you quotes like this today.\n[laughs]\nBut, um, maybe my brain has been withering.\nMm-hmm.\nBut I- it's like, yeah, there, I mean, the... Look, there- there's clearly this-...\namazing history of human beings trying to understand themselves, trying to understand the world, and building systems to do that, universities, academic traditions, math, all kinds of tools.\nAnd I don't necessarily think that AI is a new... I- I- I think it's consistent with that.\nHmm.\nI just think it's the next tool.\nSo people can have these kind of interesting abstract conversations about, is AI conscious or what's the difference between the kind of intelligence that is happening in a AI program versus in a living organism's brain?\nBut it does seem that intelligence can take other forms than just cognition, and that's the more kind of animist-\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n... spirit.\nUh, I personally find consciousness to be a almost, I don't know, to me, it's almost like a boring topic.\n[laughs]\nLike, I- I don't know how to put it, but I... There's something, something about me just finds consciousness to be almost a useless topic.\nBut intelligence or information being processed by intelligence seems more self-explanatory, seems more just observably-\nYeah, grounded\n... real.\nHmm.\nAnd so, I guess you see evidence of...\nI- it sort of depends if you call things intelligence, right?\nAnd David Krakauer, who runs the Santa Fe Institute, always makes this point that complexity, science can sort of be thought of as the exploration of designed systems.\nMm.\nAnd so, evolution-\n... can be thought of as a design process.\nRight.\nNow, that doesn't necessarily demand that there be a designer.\nWell, I was gonna say, what is a non-designed sy- an, uh, w- yeah, what systems aren't designed?\nIf that, if you're gonna take that kind of cut on it.\nYeah, that's a, that's a great question.\nYou have to ask David.\nAnd maybe that's his point, yeah.\n[laughs]\nYou have to ask David Krakauer.\nBut, well, no, I mean, I think, yeah, like, you know, fund- fundamental physics-\n... say, does not feel like-\nRight\n... it's a design.\nYeah.\nYou know, quantum mechanics d- is not necessarily a designed system.\nHmm.\nThen something like evolution, you know, it's clearly a, a process taking place where genetic entities, genomes are being, throughout time, crafted.\nYes.\nNow, they're crafted-\nYeah, there's almost i-...\nis a will or something.\nThere's s- I, you know, I don't know what it is, but there, there is a process happening, and that process is, throughout time, manipulating information and leading to new organizations of information, new structures.\nSo, yeah, I don't know.\nThere's, there's something, there's something about that that, I, I already forget where we started.\n[laughs]\nI'll, I'll, I'll not just one step down or slightly closer to, to reality, although still a little heady on this topic, and then we can move on.\nBut, uh, there's a-\nI'm out of my depth here.\nYeah.\n[laughs]\nI think we all are.\nThere's a notion, um, that I think is adjacent to medicine, but it applies to kind of all technology, which is like, there's the sort of like hyper progress view, which is just, we should keep innovating.\nAnd then there's a view that says like, actually, there's, like, stuff in the natural world that's Lindy and it shouldn't be tampered with.\nThere's a, there's a part in the intro to the Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch where he talks about like the myth of Spaceship Earth and how it's actually like, you're, you're better off believing, like, literally the opposite of that.\nAnd as much as the earth is great, like, it's actually like 99% of species die and the replacement rate's barely above one.\nIf he was writing this from Oxford, England a thousand years ago, he would quickly die.\nAnd so in some sense, like earth has been shaped by life.\nYou could take this as far as you want, but like one place I can see this applying in the not so distant future is like, what does it mean to be human?\nTo what degree are we gonna change ourselves with technology?\nSome of this is ethical, some of this is sort of practical.\nDoes it feel like these types of things are relevant in the work you're doing today?\nOr are these like a little bit further out around, I don't know, I, I think of something like stem cells and it, there was like, back to the timing stuff, like there was a blip there that everyone got really riled up about.\nWe've seen stuff like Neuralink.\nWe've seen blips here and there.\nIt feels like this type of framework is gonna quickly, like, enter the zeitgeist in a way that's a little bit more relevant of like what, what myth of progress and technology do you believe?\nEh, maybe I'm reaching, but it feels like w- yeah, it feels like that could be something that we actually have to face a lot more clearly soon.\nYeah, we could.\nYeah.\nBut then I'm not sure it, I'm not sure it matters.\nYou know, like, I think there's a real fixation on the sort of sci-fi, big, exciting, high concept-\n[laughs]\n... transformation of everything, and I...I just try to stay more grounded and focused on fixing real problems for real people, [laughs] and people who are alive today and suffering-\n... as opposed to whatever happens next.\nMm-hmm.\nSo I don't know how fast this stuff is arriving.\nI mean, you could take CRISPR, which we talked about before, and it's like, yeah, I mean, that may end up being the technology that we use for Gattaca.\nAnd, you know, we'll probably be editing embryos at some point not too far from now, and that could be interesting, and it could... You know, the first thing we'll probably do with that is prevent heritable diseases.\n[laughs]\nSo great, like do I-\n[laughs]\nYeah, incremental notch up the ladder.\nYeah, like I w- I would love to see that.\nThat, that's great.\nI mean, I don't want people born with these, like congenital illnesses that ruin their lives.\nYeah, 99% of people are gonna tolerate that.\n100%.\nSo I just think always better to focus on the useful and-\n... obviously great possibilities of the new technology, and let's, let's run at those and make them happen.\nAnd then, sure, we need mechanisms to worry about all the risks and all the crazy stuff, but I, I just don't...\nI, I mean, w- we're not gonna stop.\nIt just seems obvious that we're not gonna stop.\nSo there's this, in a way, it's a bit of a performative move that people make to just...\nYou know, you sound smart by sounding the alarm on things-\n... and being, uh, hysterical and worrying.\nAnd, at least to me, it's just not interesting to have that attitude.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd meanwhile, I think what I always find a little bit disingenuous about those super critical voices is these people tend to have very little to say about the disasters that we've already wrought upon the actual Earth today, and upon people today.\nI never hear these people who are worried about runaway AI, um, talking about how we, you know, help people in Bangladesh, or how we stop killing, you know, hundreds of millions of animals every year-\nRight\n... for no reason.\nRight.\nSo I think it's-\nIt's almost a cop out to play in theory land.\nI think it's more of a pose than it is...\nAnd it's, it's a way of sort of having cred in a particular community where everyone likes to, uh, outdo each other by showing how futuristic and crazy they are.\nMm-hmm.\nA couple of questions about sort of, like art and creativity, and, and maybe starting on closer to the AI front.\nThere's an old interview that I think is incredibly prescient, um, where you're talking about computers and y- this is, I think, right as Time Machine is coming out.\nYou say, \"One of the big challenges I've thought about in making this record is that the role of computers has become so inescapable, and computers offer so many possibilities for creativity, but they also make you lazy.\nThey make it so convenient to do things in a certain way that almost everybody goes for that default position.\nI feel like we're going through this transition where everyone's trying to figure out what the machines and computers are good at and what the appropriate balance of responsibilities is between the human and the machine.\nWith my music, I'm trying to think carefully where they can each fulfill their strong suit.\"\nFast-forward 10 years, uh, you can press a button and generate, if not a song, like something close to a song, um, and if not a film, some- at least a really incredible Ghibli image.\nThere's a theme here that, like you were sensing even then, that, like AI allows, or\n\n\nComputers allow us to skip over the details. When you build something by hand, you have to get really up close with all the details. And it reminded me of something else I heard you talking about, which was this interaction where I think you were with Pharrell and you guys met Herbie Hancock. And Pharrell, you described Pharrell as this very, like, kind of like theoretical musician who had historically kind of like avoided getting too technical, and his fear was that it would maybe cause him to miss some of the forest through the trees or whatever. And Herbie told him, your words, at least in recall, \"It's just gonna give you more colors. It doesn't cost you anything. It gives you more things you can say with those ideas you've got.\" And I realize I'm connecting a few things here, but I'm curious how you relate to this idea of adding more texture or rigor or resolution, whether it be in the narrow of kind of the work you do in investing or, or more broadly in creativity and life.\n\nYeah, uh, that comment Herbie Hancock had really goes back to the first topic we talked about, which is this depth, you know, versus breadth kind of thing. Because that technical depth in music really does unlock your expressive capabilities. And I think the new possibilities that the automated music-making bring to the table are that they obviously let people start to express themselves and get a taste of it with a very low price of admission. Right. And so they're really cool and they're empowering in that way, but the greatest artists are gonna still be the ones who have an ability to be very granular. Hmm. And so you, there, there's so... I mean, one of the things that's so great about music is there's so much subtlety that's possible, right? And the, the way that a guitar player bends a string slightly. You know, real masters have a command of all of those subtle choices, and so, the range of ideas and impulses that they can express is enormous. You know, someone like Herbie Hancock can basically say anything in music. And probably not saying the same thing more than once ever too, which is pretty remarkable. That's right. S- he has so many tools in his toolkit. I think there's that spectrum among creators, which is basically, how vast are your powers? Hmm. And the point I'm making is that having Suno to, you know, be able to generate songs for you is really cool, but it, it's giving you what feel like a lot of powers, but for you to really, for you to do what Herbie Hancock does, you would need to program Suno. Hmm. Yeah, it's just way more horsepower without any of the other things in a car. It's like a blunt analogy. Yeah. But- I mean, I think about, I play tennis, and I think about it, like, in tennis, y- y- you know, like the, uh, this is a common thing with any hobby. Like, of course, amateurs can often fall for the mistake, as I do, of thinking, \"Oh, I just need a different piece of gear.\" [laughs] Like, \"Oh, if I just had Djokovic's racket-\" Yes, yes. Right? And of course, that's like, how companies sell you tennis rackets. Of course. They say, \"Well, the guy plays with this,\" and then you get the racket, and obviously, you don't play like Djokovic. So, and that's clearly, that's true with the piano. Hmm. Now, and, and, but, but the difference is, if you gave me a piano, it's immediately obvious that I'm not Herbie Hancock. If you give me Suno- Right, this is the question... then I think what's fascinating is, if you give me Suno, how do you know I'm not Pharrell? And I believe that telling the difference probably actually requires the listener to be quite educated. Hmm. So- That's a different musical world if you live in that world then. It really is, because it, it's a world where the musical need of the lowest, of the, of the average consumer may easily be met- Right... by- Or, but maybe, maybe the, the need will, uh, the floor on that will rise. That would be a maybe slightly more optimistic view, is that like it raises everybody's musical literacy. That, that could be. Hmm. I mean, that, that would be a great outcome, is if everyone said, you know, sort of judged human artists then against the AI stuff and said, \"Your song stinks because it, it just sounds like all these AI songs. So, why do I need to hear it?\" [laughs] Yeah. Um, there is this sort of sad niche of music too, which is a lot of... There, there are some really great musicians who have not had a lot of success commercially, and then they end up in the world of commercial music. Ah. You know, basically making tons of music that is played in, you know, television ads and... background music on Real Housewives. And no, I'm not... There's nothing wrong with that. Like, and, and there are people who do that, who love doing that. But I always think it's like slightly... There's something a little sad about it because sometimes, you'll hear in that music a really kind of slick idea, and you go, \"Oh, I hear-\" They're trying to play with it. Yeah. You know, I hear the talent- The life, yeah... in that person who has been consigned to make background music- Ha, ha... but could have been Herbie Hancock. It's a little, you know... Anyways, the, yeah, you could have the same kind of thing happen though, with... I, I don't know. I mean, all the commercial music will probably just end up being totally free. Yeah. All music for utility. Automated. Why... Anything for utility, why would we not automate? Yeah, and then it becomes a thing of like, well then, what do people want from, quote, \"real music\"? And, you know, I don't know. There's just, there's something, I think it is ultimately communication medium. And so when you... I mean, I went and saw Lady Gaga at Coachella this past weekend, and it was incredible. One of the great shows maybe of all time. Wow. And it was really cool for me to see in particular 'cause we toured with her on her first tour. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, I remember some of those songs, seen them 15 years ago- Wow... every night. And, and it was clear then, and it was even more obvious this past weekend, how brilliant she is. And it's not just the music. It's the dancing and the costumes and the stage presence. It's all this stuff. But we're a long way from being able to automate that. You know, and I... It's hard for me to put my finger on what that is. But, you know, there aren't many of those artists, and people tend to agree on who they are. Hmm. And they tend to be very popular and to sell out stadiums. And I think that will continue for, for a while.\n\nOn the note of performance, it seems like one of the things you liked least about being a musician was touring. There's a line in some interview where you said, \"I don't usually... I usually don't perform because I don't have a great way of performing.\" Hmm. Uh, and I think you were just talking about like in my day-to-day life now. What's your relationship to... And I'm, I'm being maybe deliberately heady here, but like what's your relationship to performance today more broadly, in the sense that you're, you are someone who is pretty public online. Granted, it's more, well, much more Twitter than Instagram. You do writing, you're speaking. You also have some element of like fame hanging over, uh, at least your adult life. Very charitable. [laughs] Um, what is... Yeah, I, I... One is if there's any reflections on what it was about the touring part that was, you didn't connect with? And two, like, yeah, how do you think about maybe your external life?\n\nI didn't like the lifestyle of being on tour. It's just very boring and really exhausting. But I, I think I did actually like performing, and I recently was like, oh, watching some videos of old shows, and, uh, and I was thinking, I, that was actually really fun. Hmm. I, I, and what made that fun was, I think, that it was highly performative. I mean, it was a character in a way. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, you know, I got to- Talk about Lady Gaga, right? Yeah, like, you know, to be able to go on stage and kind of play this character of rock star- [laughs]... or, or at least as I imagined it, it was fun, you know, and, um, and energizing. And so, I could do that again. Like, I, I don't know, I... Part, part of me is, is kinda nostalgic about it. But then, I would say, in the past few years, I've been very interested in a different concept of performance, and this gets into public, I don't know, communication, performance, whatever. The first thing I'd say is, you know, like, uh, fame is a, at this point, a really kind of corny... Well, I, I, let me put it this way. In the past, people used to get famous, and then they would like, they'd be s- they'd be famous and they couldn't undo it. And now, everyone is competing for attention so intensely that anyone who's famous, you can be almost certain, really wants to be famous. Right, you can opt out passively almost, and yeah. Hmm. Yeah, because it requires so much work to be famous today- Fascinating... and to stay famous. You, you have to fight for mindshare relentlessly. And so, on the one hand, I, I just, one, I'm not good at that game at the level it's being played today. And two, I don't wanna do it, uh, and I'm not even sure I'd be successful at it. But then, in the limited spheres where I am doing a podcast with you or writing something or posting on Twitter or [laughs] whatever it is, my goal has almost been to, like, not have a character, you know? It's like everyone has, in this social media mediated system, become so fixated on performing who they want everyone to think they are. Hmm. And, and people really, you can tell, they, I mean, they're, they're almost designing who they... They're inadvertently becoming a person- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... based on what they think. And maybe that's always been that way. I mean, I don't know if just going into the town square in the 16th century- Yeah, but we have way more chance... We have way more surface area and time of our lives doing it, at least with the internet, right? Yeah, it's, it becomes a creative act, I guess, is what I'm saying. It bec- and to the extent that everyone is effectively de- dec- deciding to become a broadcast personality at all times, they are getting to choose who the character is they wanna be. And, and you can see it in every sphere, right? I mean, you see it with the tech people. They, they sort of wanna perform like a kind of autism to sound like Peter Thiel or Zuckerberg, or they want to... You know, a lot of it is, like we were talking about before, it's, \"Okay, I wanna really show everyone how fucking visionary and out- outlandish my ideas are.\" Or you wanna show that like you're so orthogonal, you're gonna do like defense tech because that's like badass or like America stuff. Right? Often, those in themselves are copying an affect of some person. I'm gonna be weird like you are. I'm gonna be an asshole like Steve Jobs. 100%. And so, what's interesting to me is to try and have no semiotics. Hmm. I'm very interested in that idea. Can, you know, I'm interested in artists who do that too. Like, can you, can you dress in a way, for example, that says nothing- [laughs]... clear. [laughs] Where, where it's like sort of, you know, could you dress nicely but not in a way that signals explicitly membership in any particular tribe? [laughs] Well, this reminds me a little bit of when authentic... Sometime in the, the early 2010s, authenticity itself became an aesthetic, when that really broke all the rules. [laughs] 'Cause then it's like, oh wait, what even, what it, what it, what is... But yeah, that's, it's like, what's the vanilla ice cream? And even, yeah, vanilla's maybe a n- an imperfect metaphor, but... Or how do you just, you know, like how do you... Writing essays is kinda fun because it, it, it's sort of as close as you can get to just like direct ideas. Yeah. You know, just like- Yeah, yeah, yeah... plug into my brain. Right. Here's what I'm thinking. Right. And I, I don't know, I kinda like that, and I like Substack quite a bit because- You do have a, kind of rena-, you have a renaissance of, like, really smart people on there, writing more stuff than I can read. And I, I'm sure I've only discovered a small fraction of them. But even that, it's like, wow, like... You know, back to browsing the internet, like the internet's so big and there are so many people, and they're so talented. Like, they're so smart. There's so many smart people on the internet, and we haven't e- I haven't, don't even know how many smart people there are in China or India or people, you know, where they're writing on the internet and I can't read it. So it's like, w- in that context, like, what do you say? Like what, what do you s- what is there to say? Mm-hmm. Why even say anything? Hmm. Hmm. Is it p- is there anything that's not already being said? You know, and, and I, that's why I think- Why are you saying things? You don't ha- you don't need to. Well, I'm\n\n\nI'm only trying to say things if I have what I feel is, like, an original thought. You know, so this, like, zero-toll medicine thing, like, I was thinking about that for months and trying to kinda clarify it in my head. And then I thought, okay, I haven't heard this before.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd when I previewed it in conversation with a bunch of smart healthcare people, they've, it was seemed like a new idea to them. So I thought, okay, this is worth writing. But when I'm tempted to, you know, write a screed about the tariffs-\n\n[laughs]\n\n... it's like, why? Like, that's- By the way, this won't matter in a week.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nIt's just totally duplicative-\n\nThat's a great point...\n\nwaste of time, labor.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, and I'd rather Matt Yglesias write it or whoever, you know? I don't know.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe on the far end, opposite end of the spectrum of that, you've pointed at beauty as something like a moral criteria. A couple of random tidbits. Once, there's just some old place where you're asked about the music and you said if, if there were one quality to it all that, that I'm gonna prioritize is beauty. There's also a, uh, amazing Instagram story highlight that I came across-\n\nUh-oh\n\n... [laughs] where you, where you say, \"Philosophers come up with all sorts of reasons to a- attribute moral valence to different entities. I increasingly feel that beauty is the only criteria needed. Subjective though it may ultimately be, living with a dog is one experience that reinforces this.\"\n\n[laughs]\n\n\"The dazzling structure of another creature is a sufficient reason to respect it.\"\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nThat's very, uh, embarrassing.\n\n[laughs] I met Yoshi today.\n\nYes.\n\nI th- I think I can validate that.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nUm-\n\nIt's a very beautiful dog. What does it mean or feel like to be motivated by beauty? Ma- I mean, maybe it's a kinda counterpart to the curiosity thing. It's just a, it's just like a, a North Star. Like, I guess, uh, maybe that's just a personality trait? Like, I'm just drawn to it. I feel like it is, I feel like it matters. And, uh, I want... I, I don't know. I guess it's just I want that principle to order my life however possible, not to, like, a... I mean, there are people I know from, like, the fashion world almost who are, like, fascist about beauty.\n\n[laughs]\n\nYou know? It's like-\n\n[laughs]\n\nThey, I mean, if you watched that movie the Phantom Thread, which I loved-\n\nYeah, amazing.\n\nThe PT Anderson movie. It's like, that character is kind of a, you know, that's a, that's a beauty fascist.\n\nHmm.\n\nRight? You know, it's just a total intolerance of the actual mess of the world-\n\n... um,\n\nand wanting to control everything and make it perfect and whatever.\n\nHmm.\n\nRight. But that is, like, the art instinct fundamentally is that you want to create things in, in whatever wa- I mean, whatever you think is beautiful.\n\nHmm.\n\nIt, I mean, I guess the thing is, it is fundamentally aesthetic. And, and-\n\nIs it?\n\nI think so.\n\nHuh.\n\nOkay. Meaning, I guess I'm just saying if, if ideas flow together perfectly, we would call that logical.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nHmm.\n\nI see.\n\nEh, e- I mean, you can say it's beautiful, but that, it, it really is logical. Whereas if the sound of the language in a poem or in someone's novel or essay, if it sounds mellifluous and rhythmic and whatever, then you would call that beautiful.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo it's, it's inherently about the aesthetic quality of things.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd so I think that can be present in any medium. It can be... I mean, I like interior design. I like fragrance. I, I d- did a fragrance a couple years ago. I like music. I like, uh, architecture. I'm, I'm, w- for whatever reason, I'm less drawn to painting and, and, like, you know, 2D visual art maybe. I don't know exactly why. I, I try to get into it.\n\n[laughs]\n\nBut... A poetry, I'm not, like, the biggest fan of. But I don't know, ba- basically across all these things, you can find a lot of beauty. And that's what in a way everyone's kinda chasing. And then there's the critique. Tom Wolfe, the novelist, had a book called The Painted Word, which was like a critique of modern art.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnd the phrase, \"the painted word,\" gets at the idea that a lot of modern conceptual art was only interesting in terms of the essay that you would write about it.\n\n[laughs]\n\nMe- meaning, like-\n\nYeah.\n\nA- and, you know, he was probably, like, too hard on-\n\nSure\n\n... modern art.\n\nLike-\n\nSure\n\n... there probably is a lot of beauty in there. I, in fact, I love a lot of modern or contemporary art. But-... there, there's still, I think, that is the same point. That, you know, it's sort of like the aesthetic qualities of a thing are where beauty lives.\n\nYeah.\n\nNot the conceptual-\n\nTh- yes, yes\n\n... which is more of a, the world of words. And, and I think as someone who... You know, I'm fairly like, you know, I, I did well on, uh, language stuff, on standardized tests and things like that. And so, to me, the world of language is a world of, like, logic.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd then, the arts are like a world of beauty-\n\nYeah\n\n... and aesthetics.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd I have, I have trouble... You know, th- to me, they're kind of compartmentalized in my-\n\nHuh\n\n... in my life. That... Well, there's something, at least I relate to the notion of the non or, non or post-verbal things being closer to feeling, or presence.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd in that, I, I, there's sort of some notion of beauty that I like, which is just, it's almost like something that happens to you.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nI think that's right. There's a good, there's a, a book I just read that Brian Eno and, uh, a friend of mine w- helped him, helped him write called What Art Does.\n\nHmm.\n\nIt's great. It's really short. It, it'll, I think it will become a classic-\n\nCool\n\n... thing that artists and people love and talk about. And, uh, that's worth reading. Everyone listening should go get that book.\n\nCool.\n\nYou have lived many lives in some sense. There's a, uh, there's a line in a book, a novel I read a few years ago that I think about a lot. Uh, where it says, uh, \"It isn't a sadness, but a joy that we don't do the same thing for the length of our lives.\" And I don't know if I'm coping. I th- I guess I'm validating my own-\n\n[laughs]\n\n... zagging decisions. If you'll indulge me, there is a, an interview you did with Damien, uh, for Interview Mag-\n\nYeah\n\n... that plays with this idea to me. And also, maybe was predictive of where you were gonna go. This was 10 years ago. Damien says, \"If someone told you that you had co-\" And this is Damien Chazelle, who you know from college and people probably know as a director. \"If someone told you that you had to cut all the work out of your life except for one avenue, like you could make music, but you couldn't work in investment, or you could work in business, but you couldn't make music, which would you pick? Do you even see them as different? Or do you see them w- as one piece of work?\" And you go on to say, \"I see them all as being part of the same thing. And for me, that thing is, how do I push the world in the direction that I want it to go with as much leverage as possible? By leverage, I mean, how does one, how does an hour of my time have the biggest impact it can possibly have? If I had to, to cut something out, I'm not sure. Music and art for me are so sacred. I don't want to be corny, but it's almost religious or ethical. I don't think its value is the same as the value that exists in the economic or political world.\" And then you go on to talk about kind of art and commerce. And then finally, \"So I guess, if I had to give up any part of my professional life, it would be music, and it would become a hobby. That's when I enjoy it the most. But when I've done that in the past, you get frustrated that other people don't take your work as seriously because this isn't your job. You're not doing it professionally. In that way, it's not real. So what I like, by contrast, in investment and business, is that there's zero ambiguity. You measure it by the real outcomes it produces and create value by helping people do what they're doing for less money or produce more value for the same amount of labor.\" That was 10 years ago. Again, it seems like some of that maybe happened. In this multifaceted, kind of winding life, have you felt, at times, bocked in, boxed in? Have you felt like this was natural, like evolution that was sort of there, right in front of you? Was it something you were stopping and being conscious of? Do you think... May not to be too prescriptive, but do you think your life in 10 years will look as different as it did 10 years ago?\n\nHmm.\n\nNo, I have no idea. But hearing that, being, being reminded of, uh, that conversation with Damien, I'd say, 10 years later, I feel less kind of, uh, high-minded, messianic-\n\n[laughs]\n\n... about this stuff about-\n\nSo, recurring themes\n\n... this stuff about like, you know, changing the world and all that.\n\nHmm.\n\nNot that I don't think that's important, but I think what was going on is, I was starting to hang out with tech people.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd so, I was starting to get influenced by this kind of, you know, millenarian psychology of like, you know, like, \"The world's ending, we have to save it. Every comp- every software company is somehow changing the world.\" I mean, to the point where all that stuff, it be- became corny and a kind of a cliche.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd, uh, you know, Elon was saving the world with Tesla and taking us interplanetary. And I mean, that, that ethos inspired a whole generation, of course. So it's, it's been a powerful force and a powerful narrative, but I think I'm just naturally such a contrarian that when something becomes so ubiquitous-\n\n... I\n\nend up revolting.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd so, I don't know. Now, I, I almost find myself more favoring the art side of things. Not in my own day-to-day life. I mean, now I run an investment firm and I have a job, and it's high stakes. It's other people's money and take that seriously. But if I have to think about where the world's gone and where I think the energy needs to be kind of corrected, it, it seems that art and artists have become super uncool.... in a very tragic way-\n\n... where\n\nyou'd like, go to stuff in LA and it would just be all of these like, musicians kissing ass to some billionaire.\n\n[laughs]\n\nAnd it's like, \"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, like-\n\n[laughs]\n\n... this seems backwards.\"\n\n[laughs]\n\nYou know what I mean? And I, I... So I kinda feel like-\n\n[laughs]\n\n... the, you know, the like, the dorks took over. Or maybe they're just copying your playbook. I don't know. The musicians all saw...\n\n[laughs]\n\nThe, the dorks really took over.\n\n[laughs]\n\nAnd they got like, what went from being the kind of tech outsider-\n\nRight, right\n\n... underdog-\n\nRight, right\n\n... loser-\n\nThey're running government now. N- they're running everything now.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nSo, th- I don't know, just the way things should work is there should be a ba- we're, we're, we're due for a backlash of bohemian cool. I think that's probably coming. I hope it's coming because I'm so tired of just the same-\n\n[laughs]\n\n... I'm just so tired of like, the culture that is defined by podcasts, um, where nerds argue about whether AI is gonna take over civilization-\n\n[laughs]\n\n... and like, frustrate us becoming a space-faring species. And I don't, I don't even... Like, the problem is it has like, no vibe. It has like-\n\n[laughs]\n\n... it has no aesthetic. It has no edge. You know, like, the edgelord isn't edgy. The edgelord is just an asshole. Th- the edgelord is just racist. It's not... There's nothing charming about it. And so, I don't know, I've kinda been going back and talking to a lot of my friends, be it actors, musicians, whatever-\n\nYeah\n\n... and just saying like, \"Guys, look, like, you know, I'm sort of... I got a foot in each of these worlds right now.\"\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nI think you need to step your game up and, and revolt, and you need to stop inviting the nerds to the party. You gotta get more arti- these artists on podcasts. They gotta-\n\nThey gotta get on pod-\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, or something else.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n[laughs]\n\nIt's probably not podcasts. I mean, I think your podcast should remain.\n\n[laughs]\n\nBut...\n\n[laughs]\n\nI was like, I don't know if I'm laughing with you or at myself or-\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nWe-\n\n... one of the two\n\n... we could do, we could do with far fewer podcasts.\n\n[laughs]\n\nBut then I wonder like, is the podcast just a, just a, a stepping stone to every conversation being recorded-\n\nProbably\n\n... always\n\n\nYou know, it's...\n\nWell, the AIs are just gonna, they're gonna just, uh, \"You don't need to listen to this whole conversation we've had. You just need like, uh, a tweet-\"\n\nA summary \"... with seven bullet points.\" Right.\n\nYeah.\n\nRight.\n\nHopefully, somebody will do that for this interview, by the way.\n\nThat's, but that then bec- yeah, that becomes then the goal is like, a good podcast would be one that can't be summarized and [laughs] you know, like, the ideas are too deep...\n\nUgh... for the AI to...\n\nI'm trying my best... do them justice.\n\nNo, man.\n\nI, I think we're... Uh, me too.\n\nThere's a question that I love, which is, there's the classic question, \"What would you do with a billion dollars?\" Which I think is actually m- a kind of a mediocre question and kind of hard to answer.\n\nMy friend David Senra, who's a podcaster, uh...\n\nYeah... has this inversion of this question.\n\nHe's a famous podcaster.\n\nHe's, he's very...\n\nWell, you're a famous podcaster as well.\n\nNo, I'm not that, I'm not, um...\n\nYeah.\n\nHis inverse question?\n\nHe says, \"What would you not stop doing for a billion dollars?\" Meaning, what in your life would you hold onto, would you not give up?\n\nHmm.\n\nAnd there's probably lots of things you could say, but I'd be curious, given again, maybe in the light of that conversation with Damien and, and the fact that... you've done a lot of different things.\n\nYou did give up professional m- music making.\n\nOh, it would just be my people.\n\nHmm.\n\nYou know, like, I think relationships are the only valuable thing.\n\nSo, I think if you, if you don't think of relationships instrumentally, but as the end.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nRight?\n\nAnd you go, \"Okay, I'm gonna choose what I do professionally based on who that leads me to spend time with.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that's the right approach, or at least for me, that's the right approach.\n\nSo, yeah, I don't know.\n\nI mean, I'd be totally happy not working.\n\nI, I'd be, I'd happily give up work.\n\nThat's the first thing I'd give up.\n\nYou know, I could give up music.\n\nI could... I, I don't know, it's just my people though.\n\nJust being with the people I like spending time with is the, that's kinda the only important thing.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nA few final questions as I kinda run through a lightning round as we wrap up.\n\nYou've played with and talked about like, anonymity or pseudonymity in the past.\n\nNot extensively with your music, but, uh, there's, there's an old interview talking with Peter about like, Led Zeppelin, how it was cool that they didn't put their faces on, on the album.\n\nYou, you said something along the lines of like, \"I do kind of regret not being around when there was that level of like, magic about who was making the thing you heard.\" And you did make one, I think, when Glowing first came out, you did an honestly, directed by Tyler, The Creator, I might add, which was an amazing bit of trivia, really cool video.\n\nMaybe that gets back to the performance question a little bit.\n\nBut I'm curious if that was ever something you considered playing with more dynamically or even as you think about the way your ideas are delivered now.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of... loaded ideas that come with your name and who you are and who you've been.\n\nIt seems that the internet at least has become way more tolerant of this type of thing in certain pockets, but I'm curious if you have any reflections on it.\n\nI, I go back to what I said before.\n\nI think, I think it's so hard to stand out today and to be heard or noticed.\n\nAnd at this point, I don't even have a very large audience of any kind.\n\nI feel like a total civilian.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, yeah to be... I mean, I don't know.\n\nMay- maybe I would get a bigger audience if I did things anonymously [laughs].\n\n[laughs]\n\nI mean, I, I sort of thought that- When I did that Glowing video, I put it out, and obviously-\n\nOh, Glowing.\n\nI'm sorry... No worries.\n\nBecause I thought, like, the band... You know, the band was not that big either, but we had actually garnered a lot of hatred from, like, Pitchfork Magazine.\n\nLike-\n\nNo way.\n\nPitchfork was, like, really mean about us and-\n\n[laughs]... some of these other things.\n\nAnd I always resented that we didn't, like, get fans from a particular quarter... which, at the time, was kinda, like, the Brooklyn music obsessed kinda, like...\n\nAficionado... aficionado crowd.\n\nLike, we got... I mean, I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to do it at all.\n\nAnd I got enough external validation for our music from musicians...\n\nSome pretty notable musicians... who I love... really liked you guys.\n\nAnd it's like, \"What more could I want, you know, than to have musicians who I really admire say your music's good?\"\n\n'Cause you never know.\n\nI mean, it's, it's a completely subjective thing.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd so... And you always wonder.\n\nI mean, uh, I get so insecure when I make music, 'cause then it's like, you go show it to people, and sometimes they just... You can tell they don't like it.\n\nOr you can tell they... You can tell it just does nothing for them.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd it's kinda like, uh, like, \"Maybe I... Do I suck?\" Like, \"I don't know.\" But then the truth is, there is no sucking, really.\n\nIt's just... It's a subjective thing.\n\nBy the way, the other side of that is, I don't know, I always think of that, that... There's that Pharrell video where he hears Maggie Rogers music the first time, and it's like-\n\nOh, yeah... there's nothing quite like the obstacle.\n\nIt's so cool.\n\nIt's so cool.\n\nAnd seeing her see him-\n\nRight... show her-\n\nInsane... it's great.\n\nYeah.\n\nNow, he is a master at that.\n\nAh.\n\nBecause he is the greatest salesman in history.\n\n[laughs]\n\nBut it is, it is genuine.\n\nIt is, it's both genuine and incredibly effective strategically.\n\nYou're like, \"I've seen that face.\" Yeah.\n\nWell, 'cause it's like, he'll, he'll... I mean, he can do anything.\n\nHe, he... Meaning, he can... He writes the whole song, he makes all the music, he sings it.\n\nAnd then a lot of the songs he's produced, the artist comes into the studio, and he plays them, like, ten songs that he's made.\n\nAnd it's like they're picking.\n\nWow.\n\nWow.\n\nSo, I mean, he is-\n\nWow, off the shelf.\n\nHe is selling them a song.\n\nAnd like, he's incredible at doing that.\n\nCrazy.\n\nLike, he really makes people feel amazing about their music and feel like they're really brilliant.\n\nAnd he's, he's done that to me, so I, I will believe that it's totally sincere.\n\n[laughs]\n\nBut anyways, anonymity, is that what we were talking about?\n\nYeah, it was in-\n\nSorry, I rambled.\n\nWe got somewhere else interesting.\n\nI rambled.\n\nYou studied African American studies and got a certificate in Gikuyu, which I'm certainly pronouncing wrong.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThat's all right.\n\nUh, which is a Kenyan language.\n\nAnd I think, also, maybe Cornel West was a teacher?\n\nThat was a lifetime ago.\n\nWhat was your relationship with that?\n\nLike, why was that interesting?\n\nIt was just great.\n\nI... Cornel, unfortunately, was not there.\n\nOh, okay, okay.\n\nHe had left, like, a year or two before because he got in this big fight with Larry Summers, who was the president of Harvard.\n\n[laughs]\n\nAnd Larry Summers is in a lot of fights.\n\nAnyways, it was, it was a great experience.\n\nI had amazing teachers.\n\nAnd, uh, Henry Louis Gates was a famous professor there at Harvard.\n\nHe was... He kinda built that African American studies department that I was in.\n\nSo, he was a luminary, who I got to hang out with a lot, and he was awesome.\n\nAnd, uh, I loved it because it was totally interdisciplinary.\n\nHuh.\n\nSo, I got interested in African American studies in high school because I was in Milwaukee, which is, like, by some measures, the most racially segregated city in America.\n\nReally?\n\nI didn't know that.\n\nAnd so I was very interested in just, like, how did it get this way and how could it be fixed?\n\nHow did racial identity-\n\nHuh... develop in the way that it did in America?\n\nAnd I also just think the story of Black people in America is kind of the best story ever.\n\nIt's...\n\nI mean, it is just...\n\nIt's an unbelievable history.\n\nIt's larger than life.\n\nThe characters are amazing.\n\nThere's tragedy.\n\nThere's comedy.\n\nThere's beauty.\n\nThere's justice.\n\nThere's obviously even more injustice.\n\nAnd the story's not over.\n\nAnd so it was just catnip for me.\n\nAnd, uh, and it was a great, it was a great department.\n\nA lotta music in that story too, which is cool.\n\nLot of music.\n\nThe best music.\n\nSpeaking of, you said your, uh, favorite is Elvin Jones?\n\nYeah, he was.\n\nAt least-\n\nOne of them.\n\nAt least was?\n\nYeah.\n\nDo you have a favorite jazz album or at least a recommendation?\n\nHmm.\n\nYou were a drummer.\n\nYou were... I believe you lost the drumming job in what became your band to Damian, who we talked about earlier.\n\nThat's right.\n\nYeah, he was a better drummer.\n\n[laughs]\n\nI'd say my favorite jazz album.\n\nI, I really like Something Else, the Cannonball Adderley record.\n\nI don't know it.\n\nI think that's a great record.\n\nI love, uh, A Love Supreme, the Coltrane album.\n\nThat's kind of as good as it gets.\n\nI like Wes Montgomery a lot.\n\nThere's so many.\n\nThe thing about that era of jazz is it's kinda, like, all good.\n\nI mean, it's not all good, but it's...\n\nSo, so many of those albums are just sort of, like, five players, uh, going to Rudy Van Gelder's studio and recording six of their tunes.\n\nAnd-... you could have seen something equally as good watching them in a club any night of the week, and they could've chosen to do six different songs and it would've been equally good.\n\nSo, there is a lot of quality in that...\n\nIt's a tragedy where we've got... repertoire... we got the world of many podcasts being recorded and not, not so many of those performances being recorded.\n\nYeah!\n\nMan, that'd be, that'd be cool if people were doing like, tons of music recordings the way... Or maybe they are, though.\n\nI mean, you-\n\nYeah... that's the thing about Spotify, it's like I even struggle to think about making music and putting it out 'cause I don't know what the numbers are but it's, you know, hundreds of thousands of new songs being uploaded per day?\n\nOr something crazy like that.\n\n20,000?\n\nI don't know, I might be off by an order of magnitude maybe, but like still.\n\nIt's, it's more than you could ever listen to.\n\nAnd like a lot of listeners, I struggle to find new stuff.\n\nWhich is crazy.\n\nDo you have any... As someone who's probably... Even if you're not saying it, incrementally better than the average person at that.\n\nI think p- this comes up all the time.\n\nPart of this, I think, is the products and the platforms.\n\nPart of it is the abundance and all the infinite choice.\n\nDo you have any tips or thoughts on finding great new music?\n\nHonestly, I use the Spotify Discover Weekly.\n\nYeah.\n\n[laughs]\n\nThing that's personalized to me.\n\nOkay.\n\n[laughs]\n\nSo it's-\n\nDid you play any role in that product?\n\nI didn't.\n\nNo, but it feeds me a new, you know, it feeds me a new... I had a role in some other parts of Spotify, not that... Not those automated playlists.\n\nBut it feeds me a bunch of songs I've never heard every week that are somehow related to stuff I've listened to.\n\nSo, I do find good stuff that way.\n\nBut it... I wish it would now take me another concentric circle out.\n\nRight.\n\nRight.\n\nTh-... And I think that's the challenge.\n\nIt feels like it's hard to click, click farther.\n\nYeah, it's hard to get out of your filter bubble or whatever.\n\nWhat do you love about LA?\n\nLA, I think, is the most open-minded city, maybe in the world?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nI don't wanna speak for the Chinese cities which I've not been to, but LA is a place where crazy people from all over the world come here.\n\nAnd then, the city doesn't really have a culture.\n\nSo, what ends up happening is every person creates and then inhabits their own fantasy world.\n\nSo, on the one hand, what, what's not nice about LA is it's super atomized.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd with that, you don't really have real community.\n\nYeah.\n\nThere are pockets of it, but it's hard to have community in LA.\n\nAnd there's this quality in LA, particularly in the, you know, where the air is thin, where it's kind of like, you know, if you disappeared tomorrow, no one would notice.\n\nTh-... And LA's transient.\n\nPeople are always, you know...\n\nParticularly in these sort of transnational global elite of people who, you know, \"Oh, I'm in New York this year.\n\nNo, I'm in LA for the next couple years.\"\n\nRight.\n\n\"Uh, then I went to Austin, then I...\" It, it's like, it's always in motion which is good and bad.\n\nBut it's-\n\nIt-\n\nIt's... One, and one thing that's nice about it is everyone comes here.\n\nSo, I don't love traveling.\n\nI mean, I do it, but it's not... I don't live for it.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, uh, living in LA you don't need to travel that much.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\n'Cause if you wanna see someone, you just like wait a month and they'll be in LA.\n\nYeah, you got random podcasters showing up in your living room.\n\n100%.\n\nThere's an amazing, uh, LA essay on Patrick Coll\n\n\nIson's website and it... I'll send it to you after.\nThe, the, you captured it, which is like, he's, he's like, it's just you and you're just alone- [laughs] ... in the parking lots.\n[laughs]\nAnd like, there's no one's gonna save you.\nWow.\nHe wrote this?\nPatrick didn't write it.\nHe recommend- Oh, nice.\nHe's got like a list of, of, of places.\nI, I'll have- Yeah.\nI should remember who, who wrote it.\nMy final question- I didn't mean to imply that those guys are not really smart, by the way, earlier.\nI mean, I think consensus, they're really smart.\nI don't know them.\nI know they like doing smart stuff.\n[laughs]\nYou have a young daughter.\nYes.\nYou actually talked about this on, on one of the interviews.\nYou were, you were sort of suppo-... This was before you had her.\nAbout like, maybe one of the challenges for you being able to impart your kids with that value of like rote skill building or practice.\nAnd yet, it sort of feels like we're living in a world today, and I would have to imagine for her as an adult, where like rote skill is not that meaningful or valuable.\nYou, you had one little thing which is, which was, \"Hey, you should just have to like sit in front of a piano for 30 minutes every day, and you don't really have to have any specific guidelines there.\"\nUh, yeah, what, what values or what skills, what learning approaches, what, what do you think is important to teach her for a future that is very uncertain?\nI don't think it's about skills at all.\nAnd I y-... I think it's old-school.\nI mean, I think all the old-school stuff is still what's important.\nI think it's history, which is kinda the only real subject.\nIt's history.\nIt's, uh, values and, and ethics.\nThe way of being able to think about moral questions and understand them from mul- multiple perspectives and turn 'em inside out.\nThat kind of critical thinking, I think that you get through philosophy.\nI think some sense of engineering is valuable.\nAnd as we've talked about a lot, this ... the curiosity and the taste for beauty are important to me to impart.\nSo, a- and so, you know, they... Going with the ethical stuff, all the social.\nHow do you, how do you treat people?\nWhat, what are good manners?\nI mean, these are the things that people are lacking, arguably.\n[laughs]\nMm-hmm.\nAnd I think people have been saying, \"Oh, it's all going to hell.\"\nFor- Yeah, the kids are... Yeah, yeah.\n[laughs]\nThey've been saying that forever, but...\nAnd, uh, you know, who, i- it's always hard to see through that j- intergenerational fog- Mm-hmm.\nWhat's really going on.\nBut by a lot of accounts, it does appear that this, you know, like Gen Z in particular has really struggled with mental illness and anxiety and all kinds of stuff.\nSo those become modern challenges that you have to try to counteract somehow.\nAnd I don't think it's, uh, you know, a trad lifestyle or whatever [laughs] is...\nI mean, it's not how, how we're approaching it.\nBut yeah, d- trying to...\nI, I don't think...\nYou know, trying to hold off on a phone as long as humanly possible and, uh, try and let her live in the, in the real world- ... with a dose of web browsing.\nYes.\nShe needs to know how to surf.\nI mean, there's a- That...\nTalk about a skill.\nBut I mean, think about that, right?\nLike there's a real difference between flipping through TikTok videos and surfing the web.\nYeah.\nYou know?\nLike, you can't surf TikTok.\nYou know what I mean?\nTraining wheels.\nIt's training wheels.\nAnd it's like just get out there on the web.\nRight?\nDon't go, don't get outside.\nGet out on the web.\nRight.\nIsn't that funny though?\nThat it's like what we...\n[laughs]\nWhat, what people assumed in a previous generation was that you needed to protect these kids from like the web.\nThe darkness.\nYeah.\nYeah, yeah.\nIt's like, \"Oh, the web is so vast.\"\n[laughs]\nAnd there are, like, all these, like, creepy back alleys they might stumble into.\nBut it's like, no, actually what you needed to, to, to protect them from was a completely- [laughs] ... you know, like a hyperbaric chamber- A monolith ... that, that Mark Zuckerberg built for them or whatever.\n[laughs]\nOr that who...\nI don't know the TikTok guy's name, you know?\nLike- Alex Zhu, I guess, originally his name.\nYeah, Alex Zhu, like, created this hyperbaric chamber for them where like they're utterly incapable of, of, you know, getting outside of- They've been rubber roomed.\nYeah.\n[laughs]\nIt's... Right.\nAnd like that's actually what makes them go crazy.\nIt's not being able to see everything everywhere.\nI, I agree.\nSo I think, yeah, surfing the web, there should be...\nMaybe we need to do like surfing the web classes.\nHow to...\nAnd do...\nIt's like do you even need to teach like safety?\nLike I remember- But that's, that's curiosity, right?\nWhen we...\nYou know, when we were in middle school, we were like getting the, the anarchist cookbook off of- [laughs] ... off of like, you know, IRC.\nYeah.\nAnd, like, that was fun.\nI mean, unless a pedophile tricked you into coming over to their house, that was harmless.\n[laughs]\n[laughs]\nSo there were like...\nYou know, there was that and there were like a few other things that you really didn't want.\nBut by the way, we were using our real names.\nYou were...\nIt was chill.\nYeah.\nIt was totally chill.\nWhat do you hope she says about her dad, your daughter?\nYou know, just, \"Badass motherfucker.\"\nJust, you know, \"The Rock times two.\"\nYeah, baby.\nDA, this was wonderful.\nHey, man.\nThank you.\nMy pleasure.\nA lot of fun.\nCool.\nCovered a lot of ground.\nWe did.\nHey, before I leave you, if you enjoyed the episode, please leave a rating and subscribe on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or YouTube.\nYou could also find full transcripts on my website at jacksondahl.com/dialectic, and obviously everything's linked in the description.\nIf you have notes, feedback or guest ideas, you can email me at pod, P-O-D, @jacksondahl.com.\nSee you next time.\n",
