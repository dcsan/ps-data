  "cleanText": "Welcome to Dialectic.\nEpisode 16 with Anjan Katta.\nBefore we get into things, this episode is brought to you by Hampton.\nI think so much of company building is actually about energy.\nAs a leader and a founder, you have to be that energy source for almost everyone in your company.\nAnd so I think having people outside of your day-to-day context can be tremendously valuable in making sure that you yourself have the energy to keep going.\nThat's where Hampton comes in.\nIt's a private membership for founders and entrepreneurs that pairs you with a subset of like-minded leaders who you'll meet with monthly to talk through all of the challenges of building a company.\nIn a sense, Hampton is a one-stop shop to create a personal board of advisors, a group that you can go to for hard problems, feedback on challenges, or simply perspective that you have the energy to keep on going.\nI've certainly benefited from this type of peer mentorship in my career.\nAnd given how lonely being a founder can be, having a group of people that you trust that you can zoom out from the day to day with is such an incredible benefit.\nWhile the heart of the Hampton membership is your intimate eight-person peer group, Hampton also has monthly and quarterly events, online speaker series, a digital community for asking the entire network of over a thousand founders questions, and more.\nHampton isn't for everybody, but for founders who are on what can be both the thrill and joy of a lifetime in company building, but also an experience that can be quite lonely at times, it's an amazing way to have a community who gets what you're going through.\nIf you've raised $3 million or have $3 million in revenue, or you've sold a company for $10 million, I had strongly encourage you to check out Hampton.\nI've included a link in the description where you can learn more, and if you apply, make sure to tell them that I sent you.\nThanks again to Hampton for supporting Dialectic.\nNow a bit about Anjan.\nAnjan is the founder and CEO of Daylight, a new type of computer company.\nI met Anjan last year at an event where he showed off Daylight's first product, the DC1.\nEffectively, if an iPad and a Kindle had a baby.\nIt turns out Anjan's been working on Daylight and that product for the last seven years, trying to make a computer that felt more like his relationship with his Kindle.\nI've long struggled with the fact that there's probably been nothing more influential on my work and much of my life than computers and the internet and how they empower my curiosity, have connected me to so many people I love, and can make it feel like anything's possible.\nMeanwhile, I've also found that modern computers seemed to be ruining my attention span, make it incredibly hard to focus, and often seemed to be directing me towards what they want rather than what I want.\nAs I got to know him better, it became clear that Anjan was truly on a mission to solve this problem, and maybe uniquely positioned to do so.\nI'll admit that I'm biased as I began working with Anjan and the Daylight team as an advisor fairly recently, but I believe that Daylight is important and good for the world, and one of the rare businesses and products that isn't inevitable.\nMany technologies simply feel like a matter of time.\nOthers require another path that are up to us to choose.\nAnd so I hope that whether you're interested in the future of computers or not, you enjoy this conversation.\nAnjan's been on quite an incredible journey and has learned a lot about himself in the process.\nI think there's a tremendous amount for all of us to learn from this conversation about tying philosophy and action, having conviction to trust our intuition, and most importantly, leaning in to our humanity.\nI know that's what Anjan has been on a path to doing for himself and is setting out to help us all do by way of the computers we use with Daylight.\nHere's Anjan.\nAnjan, how are we?\nWhat's...\nWe are going to start with something that I think you and I are both enamored by, which is, there's an old Steve Jobs idea that the computer is the bicycle for the mind, or could be, a dream that the computer could be the bicycle for the mind.\nThese days, my iPhone feels more a pacifier for the mind.\n[laughs]\nUh, my question is, what makes a great tool or what makes a great computer?\nJesus, start easy, huh?\nIcebreakers.\nI think actually, it like, sort of begs an interesting discussion around the, the terms we use here.\nIt seems pedantic, but like, do we call something a tool?\nWhen?\nDo we call something, like, an appliance?\nWhen?\nA toaster?\nMm-hmm.\nDo we call something an instrument?\nWhen?\nLike, a saxophone is clearly an instrument.\nBut a thing that measures light or light spectrum is also an instrument.\nHmm.\nA really great knife, one of those, like, Damascus steel, like, it's gonna cut that steak, no problem.\nW- where does that fit in?\nIt's a utensil?\nAnd so, like, [laughs] we sort of use these words inter-changeably, and for the most part, that's fine.\nBut if your goal is to be a toolmaker, I think it's super fascinating to see both not just the connotations we have for each of these tools, but actually, like, categorically, what conceptually is the difference between them.\nAnd, like, a lawnmower, to me, is very clearly in the realm of appliance.\nBut when I say a lawnmower, obviously all of us just use, like, electric or gas-powered automated lawnmowers.\nBut if you were to use, like, a physical lawnmower, the olden day ones, which were, like, eh, an actual workout.\nI...\nare getting into this as a trend.\nIt's a way to do chores but actually get a workout.\nPoint being is, uh, the mechanical one, is that also an appliance?\nHmm.\nI somehow put that in a different category than, like, a toaster or, like, a basic lawnmower.\nMm-hmm.\nIs, is a kazooie, the first, or a recorder, is that an instrument or is that more in the realm of, like, a machine or an appliance?\nWell, still clearly an instrument.\nMm-hmm.\nIs-\nYou know, MIDI on a computer to generate music.\nYeah.\nIs a MIDI an instrument or an appliance?\n[laughs]\nUh, is an air purifier an appliance?\nPretty literally.\nIs your vibrating toothbrush, is that an appliance, an instrument, a tool?\nLike, this all sort of sounds pedantic.\nLike, okay, what's the point?\nLike, why are you saying all of this?\nBut I think it's fascinating to see how, if we relate to a computer as an instrument, and then we think of the image of a saxophone.\nMm-hmm.\nIt's a very different set of associations than if we relate to the computer as a tool.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd I sorta used to hate people who were, like, into etymology or, like, very precise about language.\nI'm like, \"Who cares?\"\nLike, we sorta get it.\nIt's sort of now hit me, like, in a medium-is-the-message sort of way, actually our core relationship to a computer, is it a sidekick?\nIs it a Dobby the Elf?\nIs an instrument more akin to a musical instrument?\nIs it akin to a tool we use more akin to a toothbrush?\nIs it more akin to a toaster or a calculator?\nWhat is actually the set of psychological connotations, patterns, relationships, that we have to these things that we call computers?\nMm-hmm.\nUm, and within the how diverse is it, right?\nYou know, that's the whole point of Daylight.\nThe Kindle versus this and that.\nAnd I think this question actually becomes super key, 'cause the founding insight, to your point of, like, the Steve Jobs stuff, the founding insight of modern computing is, and, you know, like, Ted Nelson is a famous example of some of these folks, is, is them realizing, \"Holy shit, this isn't a calculator.\nThis isn't just a appliance.\"\nThey called it a calculating appliance, much more in the category of a toaster.\n\"It's a new medium.\"\nAnd they specifically used the word media, medium, to make sure people understood that it wasn't just a tool.\nMm-hmm.\nWhich, of course, you get caught up in when, like, the first big use case is, \"Hey, buy an, uh, buy a, buy an Apple II.\nIt's this great tool for this new thing called spreadsheets.\"\nRight?\nAnd that, that is what a computer is.\nIt is a tool I put on my desk.\nI'm a businessperson.\nIt helps me do my books faster and do finance faster.\nDoes one job.\nIt h- helps me automate one job.\nYes.\nAnd sure, there's a one beside it and one beside it and on.\nArguably, tools, I'm not, I mean, maybe I'm getting caught in the etymology, but appliances and tools, at least in my mind, both are kind of in that vein, which is, they help me do something very purpose-stated and I know what I'm gonna get out of them.\nIt's also interesting that we jump to tools and, and appliances, given that a bicycle is a vehicle, in some sense.\n[laughs]\nRight, right.\nBut al- in all of these cases, there's sort of some, almost all great tools, appliances, vehicles, et cetera, have a very explicit stated purpose and I know what I'm gonna get, and they explain themselves.\nAnd computers have started to supersede that, to your point about mediums.\nWell, I'm sort of arguing that the original insight of computing was, \"This is not a tool.\"\nMm-hmm.\nIt'll look a tool.\nIt'll go to market because of tool.\nIt'll be adopted because of tool.\n\"Hey, get one of these things.\nIt'll be useful for this.\"\n'Cause that's what's legible, right?\nRight.\nIf I tell you you have a new medium that's not legible, it's like, the legibility of, of the, of, like, the printing press based codex was, like, the Bible-\nRight.\n-and then you realize you could do all of these things.\nYeah.\nSame with TV or radio or anything.\nE- exactly.\nRight.\nAnd, um, you could argue a TV and a computer are actually a lot less different than first meets the eye.\nMm-hmm.\nOr like, uh, we easily put these in different categories because of how we grew up.\nBut if you actually analyze it carefully, and maybe I'll get to it in a second, they're actually a lot more similar than they are.\nWhich is they're sort of our first dynamic visual media.\nBut, uh, to me, the fundamental difference that is actually the core, core thing to hold about computing that we've lost along the way...... that I think is the essence of what we're trying to rediscover now.\nAnd therefore, I'm arguing, is actually much more than a bicycle for the mind.\nYou know, we've talked in the past, like, a bicycle for the body, for, for Maslow's hierarchy-\n... for the entirety of a being.\nThe key insight is this isn't just a faster calculator.\nThis isn't just a better calculator.\nThis isn't just a tool to do something.\nIt's a fundamental new almost state of matter of reality.\nBecause it is the first time ever we have dynamic interactive media that then also can be in relationship with you.\nAnd history has always been about objects, tools, instruments, appliances.\nThe technical definition, if you look it up, an appliance is something that can operate much more autonomously on its own.\nMm.\nYou put the stuff in the toaster.\nVersus a tool is an extended cognition of you-\nGot it\n... an extended exoskeleton of you.\nYou use it.\nYeah.\nI, I, an appliance is almost an agent.\nYeah.\nLike, \"Go toaster.\nGo toast this.\"\nYes.\n\"I'll come back.\"\nExactly.\nIt's in a, Rick and Morty, where it's the butter robot.\nYeah, yeah.\nUm-\nIt's an appliance, yeah, exactly.\nAnd hopefully we start to see, like, okay, this is sort of boring that he's making these distinctions.\nBut no, they get really, really interesting.\nMm.\nBecause it means, in places where computing is shitty because we relate to it as this, like, general purpose, do everything, we don't know what it is, you can potentially reclaim computing by specializing it into an appliance or a tool or an instrument.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd we can get into what the differences are, right?\nMm.\nWhen I think of instrument, I think of saxophone.\nThere is no right or wrong.\nIt's only an endless expression.\nIt's a creative transmutation almost.\nYes.\nOr it amplifies what, what I can do-\nYes\n... in some sort of specific way.\nYeah, I find it fascinating that when you think of instrument, immediately for me, I'm not sure about you, it goes to musical instrument, this amplification of human creativity or expression, and then a scientific instrument, this amplification of human curiosity and wonder and, like, sort of the trying to meet reality where it is.\nUm, and in places where we've shoehorned computing to be a tool or appliance, I actually think the re- the reanimation of it, the giving it a soul again, anima, I mean, soul, is by actually recognizing it is not a tool.\nIt is fundamentally a new medium in reality.\nAnd in much as one of the big problems of our era is sort of this obsession with objects, a relation to objects, modeling people as objects-\n... objectifying everything.\nIf you're familiar with, like, James C. Scott, it's sort of numbers and objects are what are most legible to us, our cognition actually then forms to do that.\nYou could call it being left brain dominant as one simplification.\nThis is the seeing a steak guy?\nYeah.\nGot it.\nIt's a, like, things-\nAll about legibility.\nthings reform around what is legible, i.e. grokable or understandable.\nThen what's, what's sort of the big thing that's missing is then we sort of treat humans objects, numbers, things.\nAnd it's like, it's no aspect of human nature that's that.\nIt's no aspect of our true operating system, in my perspective.\nIt's an aspect of the way we've had to relate to the world, which is primarily as objects and numbers, and therefore we treat humans that way.\nWe treat everything else that way.\nAnd the profound\n\n\nThe possibility of computing is it is a magical medium.\nIt is something that can have its own sort of anima.\nIt's animism reborn.\nIt's a thing that on its own can dance and sing and animate and teach and be the Bible and be the Quran and be the Kabbalah.\nThat ability for something independent of us to be animated, it's not a puppet or it's not a toaster.\nIt on its own can be animated.\nIt's fundamentally like, you know, eukaryote, prokaryote.\nLike, you look at the history of the world, you have these textbook events.\nIt's one of those textbook events 'cause you only sort of get that.\nHow is it animated in a way that television is not?\nThat's, that's, that's where I was saying actually from one perspective, it looks more blurry because it looks a lot of the things we attribute to computing actually you could sort of attribute to TV.\nThey're just much more dynamic in the computing media, right?\nWell, the, so, I'm, let me argue against myself for a second and say they're very similar.\nThere was a guy who wrote a book basically against TV called Gerrymander, and it's stunning how well it describes the problems of modern internet and social media and stuff that.\nIt ca- And it really goes to show how much of those dynamics are captured.\nBut I'd say the difference is at the end of the day, a TV is still broadcast.\nIt's still monologue.\nIt doesn't have bidirectional interactivity.\nYeah, it is.\nIt's sort of one directionally animated.\nYes.\nAnd it therefore then cannot change its actions based on input from you, which is the basis of relationship.\nRight.\n'Cause we always think about computers as being this incredibly dehumanizing thing.\nIt's causing everything to be technocratic and objectified and reductive, right?\nAnd we're using computer metaphors for everything, and everything's thrown out the door.\nData or it's not real, right?\nLike, I, I only trust data, like, as a, as a core dogma.\nWhat I'm actually suggesting is that's a, a sort of misunderstanding of what actually the core of computing is.\nThe core of computing is us having things that actually carry the qualities that most matter to us, which I am arguing is sort of relationality.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd in much as we can rediscover computing from being an appliance or a tool, it gets fuzzy, to something that's more of a media, a medium, this new interactive.\nYou know, AI, of course, in many ways sort of pops the cherry of what's got in the way of much of computing.\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nWe actually can now change the fundamental non-human relationship we have in the world from being one of an object interaction to one of being a relational, a relationship-based interaction.\nAnd in that way, I think we actually, from our [laughs] interaction with computers meant to be the way they were always meant to be...... actually reanimate our sense of humanness and relationship, and right brain, and connectedness.\nAnd that hopefully then spreads to the rest of the world.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd I could go on and on how AI enables complexity handling, and therefore subjectivity can be considered real, versus in the past only an objective metric is considered real.\nActually, what objectivity is, is just low dimensional understandings of things, and subjectivity's a high dimensional understanding of something.\nUm, this is why old men love cigars and fast cars and sunsets.\nIt's all high dimensional things, and young men high scores.\n[laughs]\nIt's a very low dimensional thing.\nThere's some, there's an idea-\nSo-\n... inside some of what you were saying around the relation.\nUh, I don't know if it's f- fully getting into the stuff you're talking about at the end, but in the ways that computers are at least reflexive to us, you have this phrase that I love that could also describe a great tool, which is, a water slide of agency.\nCan you talk about that and how that maybe is sitting inside of what you were just saying?\nI forgot I even said that.\nUm, a caveat for, for you and everybody listening is like, I'm on this to have a lot of fun.\nSo, I have no idea at all whether it'll be helpful for any of you, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna enjoy myself.\nBut...\nI, I, I, I, I think it deeply connects, and I, I'm noticing my body getting really excited, because it feels it's a deep secret here.\nMm-hmm.\nBecause we all are like, \"Fuck, the world's getting tech and computational, like, I gotta get out of this.\nThis is dehumanizing me.\"\nAnd you can say on the surface, Daylight, me, sort of the ideology we proclaim is like, computers are dehumanizing us.\nLike, let's get to a better future.\nLet's get out of computing.\nIt's sort of that.\nYes.\nActually, I think what's really powerful here is, what I'm arguing is, no, we have misunderstood the essence of computing this entire time.\nBecause it got captured by the incredible business potential that came out of computers.\nAnd the actual-\nParticularly consumption on them.\nYes.\nYes.\nConsumption-\nPassive consumption.\nConsumption, and I would say sort of like, you know, it's called a browser for a reason.\nBrowsing.\nThat's sort of the, the sort of shallow productivity, that's messaging and emails and, you know, uh, all the basic things we have to do.\nMindless slideshow presentations.\nBy the way, all of that's necessary, if you look in a biological system, signaling is a key part of the entire system.\nLike, I don't wanna throw the baby out with the bath water, but the key thing here is the essence of computing, the beginning of computing, is actually very much tied with the human potential movement.\nYou know, what we call the new age or the hippies in the '60s.\nRight, right.\nWhich was, it was one, it was the Paul Otlet sorta Library of Alexandria, \"Oh my God, what if we can bring all the knowledge of humanity and put it to our use?\" it's sorta crazy that-\nOr Steve Jobs in the '80s a- imagining we could talk to Socrates or whatever once we, yeah.\nExactly, bingo.\nUm, what, what, what is this?\nWhat, when we talk about everybody has their personal Aristotle, or you have the Library of Alexandria, or you have this bicycle for the mind, meaning something that you would've not done because the activation energy was too high, you would've bit your pencil, picked your nose, per- like, you know, eaten your chocolate chip cookies rather than get started on-\nRight, right\n... the math problem or-\nRight\n... you know, the poem you wanna write.\nHow does it sort of augment your mind?\nMm-hmm.\nRight?\nYour, your memory, your, your processing, your reasoning, um, your executive function, your reflection, proflection.\nLike, cognition is much deeper than just like, \"I'm good at math.\"\nOh, by the way, all that makes me think of an instrument.\nBack to the idea of the musical instrument, amplifying what is possible, what I can do.\nExactly.\nYeah.\nAnd that's where the metaphor of the bicycle for the mind is actually sorta limiting.\nIt was a beautiful analogy, for the people who don't know it.\nHis point is humans are pretty average on distance we can move pers cap- uh, versus calorie expended.\nBut then someone the osprey is just off the charts.\nBut you put a human on a bike and then the human is off the charts.\nAir liquid motion is crazy, efficiency-\nNo, it's-\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nAnd his point is we as humans sometimes are not that far from our ape ancestors, but it's our ability to create tools that allow us to amplify our innate potentials that makes us special.\nMm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nAnd that's the whole call to arms there, is a tool, is like, um...\nOkay, reel me in if I get lost, and, and-\nOkay\n... and, and, and too many branches of, of logic here-\n[laughs]\nBut this gets, this gets exciting to me.\nHave you ever watched Planet Earth, the episode where the lizards are born-\nNo\n... and they immediately are attacked by many snakes?\nHmm.\nAnd then they somehow have to intuitively know to go in a certain direction, escape all the snakes and get to the ocean?\nMm-hmm.\nseconds after being born, or minutes, or...\nIt's, it's, it's the most absurd thing.\nThis thing is just born.\n[laughs]\nAnd the thing d-\nImmediate crisis\n... many animals have deep nervous system, absolute fear around.\nMm.\nThen starts surrounding, you get a bunch of them.\nRight.\nAnd you watch this thing, and it's just absurd.\nMm.\nIt's immediately like...\nAnd these are adult snakes.\nIt's immediately-\nLife finds a way\n... fighting for its life.\nAnd it's like-\nLife has some kind of will.\nYeah, it's insane.\nMm-hmm.\nBut what is the downside of that?\nIs, it's an ASIC.\nThat lizard is born with much of the possibility space of its future life built in.\nAh.\nWhich means it has it from the get-go.\nLike, good luck, me and you, even at, you know, 12 years old, I don't even know, [laughs] even older, [laughs] escaping a bunch of snakes attacking us and trying to...\nRight.\nIt has no idea where the ocean is.\nHow did it...\nIt, it has some deep-\nPredetermined.\nYes.\nIt has some deep intuitive way to notice a bunch of little clues.\nYou know, maybe the mist in the thing-\n... the sound in the distance, blah, blah, blah.\nBut the point being is it has all of this capability up front.\nIt would totally out-compute a human, totally out-compute a human.\nHuman would be-\nProbably less agentic\n... eaten in 10 outta 10.\nRelatively.\nHuh?\nPerhaps it's less agentic.\nAnd that's where I'm going, is because it got everything up front, it got baked in as a tool.\nWhen I say ASIC, I mean a computer chip that's baked in for a specific purpose.\nIt can't generalize.\nMm-hmm.\nIt can't do more.\nIt's not you meet the lizard 10 years later and he's like-\n[laughs]\n... avoiding like, you know, Komodo dragons and cheetahs.\nLike, whatever he can avoid, he's basically got that ability to avoid.\nMaybe there's a little bit of learning by doing, but he's basically fixed.\nMm.\nA human in the beginning sucks.\nYes.\nThey're dead.\nRight.\nRight?\nThere's, there's a reason we're dependent on our parents and the source of much of our trauma is how dependent we are on our parents.\nI think it's a good theory.\nAnimals don't get as traumatized 'cause they're not as dependent on their parents-\nAwesome\n... to the same degree.\nBut what does that mean?\nIt's because we're a general purpose, squishy, super learning machine.\nYes.\nBut you start out super unspecified.\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nYou're not a tool, you're a medium.\nMm.\nRight?\nAnd then the whole point of your parents, of your teachers, of societies, is to craft that medium into what's hopefully a beautiful expression of a human, which is your role in society, which is your own special snowflake.\nAnd I'm sorta reclaiming that in a good way, right?\nLike, each of our own special, unique expression.\nAnd th- the rest of the million little innate genetic abilities and, you know, quirks and lux of life that we get into.\nAnd that's our point, is we are ever evolvable and learning, and we can expand much past our, quote unquote, \"original programming\".\nYes.\nThe downside of that is it's weaker than the fixed thing in the front, but it actually is the thing that has the highest upside and the longest point.\nAnd that's my point, is computing inevitably in the beginning, won out... got won out by the lizards, because they could escape the snakes versus the human babies.\nI.e. VisiCalc on an Apple too.\nRight?\nWordPerfect.\nI will do my documents, I'll do my presentations, I will balance my books-\nIn sort of some small sense, turning a human into a computer, or into a, uh, uh, an automator.\nAn ASAC, yes, into a set of tools.\nYes.\nAnd if you think about what computers and modern society has done, is it's taken the beautiful medium of a human and it's turned it into a series of tools.\nAnd the computers are simply a reflection of that sort of recursive-\nYep\n... loop there.\nYep.\nAnd then the problem with that is it's good, but then you can't scale, you can't expand.\nAnd if the high level headline behind everything we're saying is we're trying to transition from surviving to progress, from progress to flourishing, then the most important thing we can do is sort of leave that room for expansion, for upside.\nWhat is the water slide of agency?\nWhat is that, what is that... like, that image to me feels an accelerant along that path you just described.\nBut can you f- can you talk about that a little bit more tangibly in terms of what that can mean?\nYeah, yeah.\nTo me, it's the same as what I'm saying here.\nThe wa- the waterfall of agency is an emergent property, in my perspective, from you being more a be water medium, the Bruce Lee sense of being supple or be water-\n... than a tool.\nMm.\nOr if you're a sophisticated person in society that works at Bain and got a fancy MBA, you're a set of tools that looks a human.\n[laughs]\nBut actually what you've done is you've built a bunch of tools that are good at building games.\nMm.\nAnd this is why-\nYou're specializing more and more over time.\nYes.\nAnd you've lost the innate suppleness, the innate evolvability, the innate sort of connection to life, which is actually should be one of wonder and curiosity.\nThat's why we have dopamine, by the way.\nWhen you face things that are new, rather than being scared-\n... you actually have some innate reward pathway of exploring and exploiting and trying and experimenting and that.\nThat is actually the original reason dopamine exists.\nMm.\nIt's why children cut banana slugs in half and push each other in the ground and eat gravel and do all the stuff they do.\n\n\n[laughs]\nThat's the dopamine pathways being put to work.\nAnd I'm arguing the essence of agency is actually that innate characteristic we have, that general purpose computing we have.\nYes, yes.\nThat then when you do have that innate confidence, not necessarily consciously, but subconsciously, of that you're meant to be an evolvable being, whatever you approach, your entire possibility of a human is to bootstrap and learn and get into it.\nYou then have agency.\nYou're not worried about life, 'cause all of life is foreign to you.\nRight?\nYou suck at all of it, in some sense, compared to a lizard.\nOf course, we're still better than nothing.\nYeah, and your only way forward is experimentation.\nAnd my argument is when I say if, if computing moves more from a tool or appliance more into the realm of, like, an instrument or a medium, it is not just an augmentor of your agency, it's an augmentor of your intellect.\nIt's an augmentor of your creative expression.\nIt's an augmentor of all of the aspects of being human.\nAnd that's what I mean when I say computing has its essence truly, in my perspective, in the human potential movement, 'cause it's a recognition, \"Whoa, this is a human.\nWe're sort of average.\nYou put us on a bike, oh much, oh my God.\"\nWhat are all- the aspects of our being that could be put on a bike and be much more?\nAnd actually then the metaphor of a bike then lacks.\nAnd it's not, no, a self-driving car for the mind.\nThe point is to move from it being a vehicle to it being a dance partner.\nMm.\nTo it being a medium that...\nI can get...\nI don't wanna get too tangled, but, like, Gall's law or Markov blankets.\nBasically its complexity matches your complexity, its evolvability matches your evolvability.\nIt-\nThis is the reflexivity with agency.\nYes.\nIt's-\nThat allows you to expand.\nYes, its, its relationality matches yours, you can be your full free self.\nAnd that's the essence of computing.\nIt's sort of when you're, um, when you're in flow state and an environment or an instrument or a tool is meeting you exactly where you are, a great game can even do this.\nMaybe it's a simulated version, but a great game designer.\nIt's this idea that it sort of sculpts agency by matching your abilities and your goals, and there's this feeling of, like, unlimited potential inside of that.\nI wanna...\nWe'll, we'll get more specific and concrete soon.\nJust briefly, why computers?\nWhat about you as a kid or as a teenager drew you to the seed of these ideas?\nYou know, you've now spent much of your adult life working on.\nI mean, I think I sort of the phrase, like, right trunk, edit sober.\nHmm.\nYou can sorta, like, lead with the intuition, the right brain, the, the ineffable.\nAnd then you follow with the left brain and the analysis and the unpacking in this.\nAnd I feel that's probably most of my life, which is, like, looking and...\nThe rearview mirror, I've tried to understand it in these sort of bigger philosophical and deeper historical and sort of first-principles frames.\nBut the actual way I navigated reality was much more not in the edit sober but in the right drunk.\nI think the right drunk for me was two things.\nIt was how much I loved reading and how much I was frustrated that the author couldn't talk back to me.\n[laughs]\nAnd it was also me just using my computer for everything, 'cause I thought it was like, I'm just super curious.\nAnd the fact you can click link after link after link and Google this and go up that and read this blog and go there, end up with 300 tabs, was just the most profound thing ever.\nAnd you could download mods for your PSP and play free games, and you can download game after game after game, and you could get all the walkthroughs for what you wanted, and eventually learn how to get books illegally for free.\nAnd it sort of was just like, holy crap, this is such an incredibly powerful medium for somebody who, uh, wants a grip on reality.\nMm-hmm.\nI think that's the core of it, is I, sort of overwhelmed and scared by reality, but rather than it being too scary, it was sort of wondrous.\nThere's also a lot of interactivity there.\nYes.\nYou're in the loop, it's the flow state.\nRight, you're in the loop.\nYou're sort of...\nRight.\nIt's you're cracking away at reality a brick at a time.\nAh, I see you.\nOh, I see how that works.\nAh.\nMm-hmm.\nYou try to trick me, I got you figured out.\nAnd it was sort of seeing how uniquely painful and difficult that was for me.\nMm-hmm.\nBoth at a physical level and a mental health level.\nAnd, um...\nAnd you never stopped knocking away at it, I suppose.\nYeah.\nThe Daylight was not meant to be the thing I work on.\nIt was not meant to be the big idea.\nIt was meant to be the thing I solved I could get back to working on the big idea.\nHmm.\nWhat was the big idea?\nNo idea.\nIt was something in health or medicine or mental health or-\n[laughs]\n... or something that.\nAll sort of the things I struggle with.\nit's sort of funny that the snake ate its tail.\nBut my point there is, um, I'm very ADHD, computers are just super difficult for me, because it has no natural constraints, right?\nYes.\nYou could be addicted to the news, but a newspaper has its natural constraint.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd historically that's been a bug.\nOh, what if I could see this perspective?\nWhat if I could have that?\nBut, you know, and the unlimitedness becomes a feature, but then you just move the bug to somewhere else, which is-\nI think a lot of people resonate with that these days, regardless of where they sit on the ADHD spectrum.\nI think it's probably made us as a species directionally more that way.\nAnd, by the way, most of computing is being, um, has historically been done by people on the ends of the spectrum.\nMm-hmm.\nOutliers.\nBecause they either are outliers most of the time, but some of the time they're the canary in the coal mine.\nAnd so, even the capacitive touchscreen on the iPhone was with somebody with a really bad repetitive stress injury.\nReally?\n'Cause they wanted a keyboard they could press with very little force, they invented capacitive touch.\nHuh.\nApple bought Wayne Westerman's company that became the capacitive touch-\nWow\n... that made the iPhone possible.\nWow.\nIf iPhone used resistive touch, it wouldn't exist.\nWouldn't exist.\nAnd it's sort of fascinating if you go through a lot of productivity software, a lot of computing innovations come from people who are uniquely sort of-\n... outlier.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd\nI was super ADHD.\nI have seasonal affective disorder.\nLike, I sort of get really depressed.\nUm, I, sort of inevitably have historically [laughs] gotten really depressed, but especially if I'm not outside or I'm stuck inside all the time, I get much more depressed.\nit's frustrating when you're fighting your computer, trying to be outside and, you know, half the battle is your Wi-Fi, but the other half, even when you get things downloaded, is you can't see your damn screen, right?\nyou can sort of see where that wanted to get that.\nI was reading much, I had terrible eyestrain.\nUh, some of that is how much I read, some of that is just my unique physiology.\nLike, they thought I had glaucoma 'cause my eye pressures were high from reading much.\nThat was their theory-\n[laughs]\n... that you're just literally s- squeezing your eyeballs.\nYeah.\nRight?\nThey were confused, 'cause this shouldn't be possible.\nRight.\nsomebody your age should not be having close to glaucoma-level pressures.\nBut it was stable, they just guessed what's...\nWe solve our, we solve our own problems.\nthat's it.\nIt's just like, I'm like, if the rest of my life is intermediated through a computational interface, and I don't care if it's VR, AR, or a computer in my hand or a computer in my pocket or on my wrist or in my ears, it's a computational interface.\nYep.\nAnd for the most part, what I am used to are these computational interfaces that are just make the opposite of a bicycle for the mind.\nIt makes me a worse version of myself.\nYes.\nYes.\nBut also, I mean, I, one of the things I, I love about Daylight and what you do-\nI gotta change that, right?\nOtherwise I'm not gonna be successful regardless of what I do.\nAnd to be honest, that was the origin of Daylight, is this sort of like, \"I'm screwed.\"\nMm-hmm.\n[laughs]\n\"If this is the status quo of the future, like-\"\nRight.\n\"... I will never be successful.\"\nWell, there's a feeling of being at war with it.\nThere's an old meme I love, which is the goal, the goal is to make as much money using computers as possible that I never have to use a computer again.\nI love that.\n[laughs]\n.\nI've felt this tension my whole life of the two things...\nI'm, there's few things that are more enamoring and exciting to me than the internet and computers, and yet also there are a few things that cause me more problems.\nAnd let's talk more concretely for a second.\nMy experience of Daylight has been that it's the best V1 of any product I've used in a very long time.\nCompared to the Vision Pro, which came out the same year, or at least I got the same year.\nVery different in scope, obviously, but interesting to contrast, contrast those two things.\nYou've shipped thousands of devices.\nYou're six years in, you have a real product.\nThere's a, just little things.\nPatio Eleven has this video, uh, on Twitter of him reading on a Daylight for the first time, and he's just, he's getting emotional.\nHe's describing it the Harry Potter book.\nIt's magic paper.\nMy mom's favorite tech product she's used in years is her Daylight.\nOh, no way.\nOh, wow.\nHow did we, how did we get here?\nAnd obviously the job's not finished.\nThere's a lot of work to do.\nWe'll talk more about that.\nBut-\nPage one of hopefully a very beautiful story.\nRight.\nBut I think how we got here is sort of, but it's sort of a fascinating trick reality plays on you, in, in my experience, which is sort of when you try to be selfless, deeply, you end up sort of being selfish, sort of the martyr tendency.\nAnd some of the deepest ways to unlock being selfless is to actually be selfish.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd then when you take care of your needs and your cup is full, then actually much of what you do is then actually selfless, 'cause you're not hungry anymore.\nAnd I think for long I was, like, trying to make technology that can help people.\nI sort of was obsessed with computers, just to your question of how also I was just, Steve Jobs and Nolan Bushnell and Bill Gates and Alan Kay and Ted Nelson.\nObviously you start with the flashy ones, right?\nthe, the Bill Gates and the Steve Jobs, but then you slowly go deeper and deeper and deeper into it.\nMy dad read, like, a Bill Gates biography to me when I was, like, five, so-\n... probably some indoctrination in here too.\n[laughs]\nYou had...\nTalk about lack of agency.\nI sort of got into that, I realized, like, this is what I most wanna do.\nThen I came to Silicon Valley and was just sort of, like, completely disillusioned by the reality of tech.\nInstagram had just got sold for a billion dollars, and it's everybody...\nNo offense.\nEverybody that would have been an i-banker or a consultant was just like, \"This is the high status, rational, high positive expected value thing to do.\"\nRight.\nAnd I always thought the funniest and most damning statement about entrepreneurship is historically the expected value of being a dentist has always been way higher than being an entrepreneur.\n[laughs]\nIt explains everything you need to know about who decides to become an entrepreneur.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd that sort of shifting, like, to me, felt the original sin of modern Silicon Valley, 'cause you move from people doing technology-\nWhy is that inherently a bad thing?\nJust to challenge you slightly.\nWhy, why shouldn't the world want more of people trying to be entrepreneurs?\nI don't think it's necessarily an ultimately bad thing.\nI think it's, it's a bad thing if it stays that way forever.\nIt's the reason being is what you can achieve through sort of convergent analytical things when you're in a, when you're trying to explore a new possibility space is always way more limited than a sort of divergent bottom-up exploration.\nAnd when everybody's like, \"Oh, Instagram made a billion dollars.\nOkay, I need something that is inherently got a network effect, and got this and that.\"\nRight.\n\"Okay, well, Instagram for cats.\nOkay, Uber for this, Airbnb for that.\"\nAnd of course, those adjacent possibles are, like, helpful and important, right?\nLike, we can come up with a bunch of examples of, uh, of where the, the, the copycats around something are useful.\nBut for the most part, that's sort of the more boring parts of society.\nLike, there's no- [laughs] it doesn't take much effort or risk there.\nLike, the market forces and the memetic forces will sort of take care of it.\nAll the progress is the things that are uninevitable, right?\nAnd ultimately, if you are an entrepreneur, you're getting it in spite of it being entrepreneurship.\nYou're getting into it because you have a want or a vision or a need or an opinion for the way the world should be.\nUh-\nYeah, you're trying to bend things.\nExactly, yeah.\nIt's, uh, a thing that's uninevitable.\nAnd to me, the opposite of things being uninevitable is a real estate agent.\nIf you don't sell that house, it is completely inevitable somebody else will do it.\nSort of pure, efficient market.\n[laughs] pure inevitability.\nRight.\nthere's the term additionality.\nAnd it felt to me Silicon Valley lost the essence of what it was to the world, which was additionality.\nMm-hmm.\n\n\nAnd often, because the expected value of that is lower than being a dentist, the people who do it have to do it with a lot of intrinsic motivation or delusion or some combination of all of the above, [laughs] right? And that just leads to a much more interesting possibility space, because inherently divergent and bottom-up than a top-down analytical convergent space. You need diverge and converge, right? A- a lot of our conversations off the podcast [laughs] are sort of building my skill of how to converge, but that was sort of why I was like, \"What the hell? This isn't the innovative place I thought it was. This isn't the place that's community for irreverent people.\" Uh, that's sort of how... I've always felt a black sheep. Yeah. And I was like, \"Finally, this is my home.\" I was like, \"Wait, this isn't my home.\" Ultimately realized you gotta feel home in yourself before you can feel home anywhere else. But, uh, it was powerful for me to sort of realize that, and I reacted in the moment by being like, \"Screw technology, I'm done with this. This is like, I wanna change the world, make the world a better place, total bullshit. None of these guys have any idea what they're doing. The machine is running the show.\" There's a famous line where it's like, \"Humanity is the sex organs of the machines.\" It's all these people are the sex organs of the machines and they don't even know it, and they think they're cool. Mm-hmm. I became obsessed with the idea that we have every... All the propaganda I've been taught this whole time of like, \"Tech is amazing and saves the world and this,\" is like, there's no, they don't have no idea what they're doing. If they actually... When- Like, this is the simplest of questions. Make the world a better place. What does that mean? What direction? GDP? Life saved? Happiness? How? When? Where? And then you quickly realize, like, they have no idea. I- I've said this a lot of times, but it was powerful for me to capture this, which is Einstein says, \"What characterizes the modern age is optimization of means, yet confusion of goals.\" Optimization of means, yet confusion of goals. And that's what I felt all of tech and computing in Silicon Valley was. It was people, brilliant, endlessly optimizing means, but not really clear about the goals. Which begs the question, who's, like, really in the driver's seat? Of course, nobody, right? There is no adult in the room. And my reaction was to sort of reject it all and go for the opposite. Well, I want... I'm tired of reading books. I'm tired of living in this, like, little, like, cut-off utopia. Like, give me the muck. Mm-hmm. Like, I want real life. Mm-hmm. Uh, I was miserable myself. I was disembodied. I was all in my head. I was productivity obsessed. I had 42 Chrome extensions. I had many Chrome extensions to make me productive. [laughs] And my browser was damn slow, I was never productive. [laughs] That's a good metaphor. And I just declared bankruptcy on my whole conceptual, narrative, life organizing principles, stories, everything. And I went backpacking around the world for two years. And, uh, I read a lot of, like, literature and religious stuff, and, you know, Tolstoy and early Buddhist scripts and also thermodynamics and complexity theory and Brave New World and, you know, the Unabomber Manifesto and sort of just trying to make sense of three questions. One is like, I keep getting smarter, but I'm more miserable. Like, what the hell? Like, [laughs] well, how do you actually have a good life? And two is where we all headed? Where are we going? It probably has some roots in where we came from and wh- who we are today. But what the heck is the bigger story we're a part of? And three is clearly the thing I'm most passionate about is computers and technology, and they're just magical to me. I think that's the essence of it, is they're just wonderful and they feed my curiosity. Is what is my personal relationship to this in my own life where it's empowering, it's augmenting, versus it being pandering and, uh, rent seeking and sort of debilitating in some ways? Not to take away from its miracle, but yes, those are, if, were personally accurate words. And I was sort of confused and, you know, it's rather Dunning-Kruger, the more you know, the more you realize you don't know. The, the more you learn about all this, you're like, \"Holy crap, we have no idea.\" I thought all these people, I was a proud agnostic, all these people who were religious were stupid. And then you just spend enough time, you know, I was in rural Russia near Lake Baikal and had a Russian friend with me, and, uh, you just talk to the babushkas serving you noodles in, you know, the train- train station. And you spend time with her, and you realize her life's horrible objectively. You know, you would say she's, uh, we failed on objective metrics, but her life was, she was much happier than me. She was way less depressed, 'cause everything was processed through the frame of this is challenges from God. My alcoholic husband who died was a challenge from God. The fact that the go- uh, governor is stealing half my pension is a challenge from God. And, you know, there's ways, you know, you can be taken advantage of because of that. But there's a way she was just like, \"Yeah, I- I'm sort of, I'm choosing this life. I'm not a victim and I want God to know how devoted I am and how much He loves me and I'm in love with Him and every act of me being in a relationship that challenges that.\" And she was way happier than me. You ha- there's no way you can face that and not let that hit you. Right. And there's no way you can face, you have this wondrous piece of technology and you're I'm sitting in this cheap, little, shitty hostel of fluorescent lights inside in Indonesia 'cause I can't see my screen outside or, you know, I can't journal on my Kindle. Uh, and all of the above of this sort of made me just be extremely frustrated with the state of the world, also realize how much you can't solve things by just optimizing the mind and productivity. The soul, the nervous system, the heart, your physiology, all those things matter, 'cause I was really miserable, 'cause I was just optimizing my mind at the cost of everything else. Sort of that personal experience, me realizing how much my Kindle sucked while I traveled, I came back and I was trying to come up with my big idea, trying to figure out what the meaning of life is, what a human trajectory is and what technology is. And I was doing it on computers that made me feel shit again. And I sort of was I gotta do something about this for me to work on my big idea. [laughs] I spent eight months- [laughs] ... buying every E Ink tablet under the sun. I bought a bunch of really fast printers. I got into the idea that I'll just print out my calendar, I'll print out my notes, and- ... I- I'll write everything onto them and I'll scan them. I bought these- Paper's a pretty sick technology. It's an, it's an unbelievable technology. I, I think we lack versus paper in many ways at Daylight still. We should be humble on that. Um, but yeah, I bought fast scanners too, you can bring the analog back into the digital after, write on it. I bought these highlighter pens while you read, it scans what you do. I bought live scribes. By the way, we're literally sitting in your, in your apartment and there are walls- [laughs] ... they, all of the walls are covered with giant pieces of paper and whiteboards and drawings and paper and, yeah, I wish people could see the sticky notes. Anyway. [laughs] The thumbnail. [laughs] But yeah, I've just like, I'm, in a way I sort of was not into computers. I was just looking for what is the best technology to make me feel the way I wanted to, be the way I wanted to, and sort of produce or act or think in the ways I wanted to. And I was not dogmatic. Just turns out when you're sort of low conscientiousness, carrying a lot of line of paper and remembering where it is and, you know, you can't print things 20 times a day when it's dynamic. You just, you just need things that are dynamic that can attach to the internet, but also to titrate that relationship to the internet, of course, is part of the principles. But it was that sort of personal struggles and sort of an eight, nine month idea maze of trying everything and being really disappointed by the reMarkable. I was one of the first users of it. I was just like, \"Okay, let me, like, write better software for these things.\" I teamed up with two college friends just being like, \"Ah, let's make a reMarkable with non-shitty software it can finally be a sort of healthier computer that is...\" Your first, your first lens through it was actually this is a software problem. Um, yeah. The, sort of one of the key insights that hit me is I realized like, okay, computers suck. They're just, I'm just like, I'm j- I'm intending to- to figure out the meaning of life and instead I'm wasting all my time on Twitter and tech meme and 500 tabs open. I can't go around and people are like, \"What are you doing? Are you, you had high potential. What are you doing all day?\" And I'm like, \"Well, I wanna tell you I'm figuring out the meaning of life, but if I actually told you, I'm wasting all day. Jesus, I, I'd be judged by you.\" I deeply was trying to reform this relationship to computers, 'cause I was like, \"I won't be successful if I don't do something about this.\" Everything I do comes through this, every email message, every paper I read, every line of code or word that I write. And I banned all gadgets from my bedroom. And it sounds very banal, but it was sort of a very, subtly profound thing for me, that I didn't even realize that my Kindle is a gadget. I did not ban that from my bedroom. It was not like, \"Oh no, the Kindle's okay.\" No, I just, it literally was in the same category as an analog object. Mm-hmm. Not a tool, not a computer, not an appliance, but an analog object, a book or a printout. And that was the aha moment for me in many ways. Hmm. Because you can get at this analytically and be like, \"Ah, it's less eye-straining, it's less blue light. I can use it outdoors, my nervous system is calmer, I read for more, it's less distracting, less overstimulating, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" But the fact that the subconscious part of me...... had a set of psychological relationships to it, that put it outside of the category of computer, and all the sort of crap that comes with a computer, I thought was very subtle and profound. Deeply empowering. Deeply empowering. 'Cause it's you... I've been dating my ex over and over again with computing, and this was the first time there was a new archetype, a new relationship, a new possible set of patterns. By the way, I, I, I've tried to explain Daylight, why I, I love the product, to people, and the closest thing I've gotten is something what you said, which is, it feels... There's a different feel. A huge part of that is that it's a separate object, and there's something about that object that, like... I don't think I would have put it into those words, but it, I, I totally relate. It's empowering, empowering thing. And that's what I sort of ran with, is, yes, it has all this stuff, but actually, to me, the little secret, or the little, \"Ooh,\" was a computer that doesn't feel your other computers. And actually, what that is, is there's a synthesis and an accumulation of a bunch of these things. It doesn't flicker, it's easier on your nervous system. It's a reflective screen, it's more an analog object rather than an emissive portal, which is more like, you know... It's a portal. It's something outside of your environment, outside of your reality. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right? This is very much in your reality. That was sort of the insight, was, \"Whoa, I, like, don't need to beat myself up as much on this.\" And I'm like, r- r- m- y- you know you gotta get past page 60 for Tolstoy to feel good, and then it's super easy. [laughs] . But you know that sort of, that 50 page slog? I bunch my friends have been trying to get me to read Anakranita this summer. [laughs] . And, I'll take that advice. [laughs] . I, I recommend Confession to start with- Okay, okay ... or The Death of Ivan Illich, that's a, a profound stuff. But you still got to get past the, the page 20 or the page 60 problem. [laughs] . But it's not I had more willpower. That's the whole Bicycle for the Mind, that's the Waterfall of Agency, is, I have an underlying agency to expand and learn in this. Like, I think, you know, we're all... great, uh, de Chardin quote, \"We're not human beings in this life having a spiritual experience; we're spiritual beings in this life having a human experience.\" I think that is the underlying thing. I wish people could see the smiley on your face right now. [laughs] . I love that quote. [laughs] . I could be mistaken, but I believe my, my friend Graham took that quote and combined it with this other quote from something, he addended that with, \"Welcome to the party.\" [laughs] . And, I, for some reason, I just- It's beautiful ... I love that pairing. Right. \"We're spiritual ve- beings having a human experience, welcome to the party.\" Right. [laughs] . Yeah. So, I don\n\n\nI don't think it's a coincidence. We listen to a three-hour podcast now to sort of educate and expand ourselves.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nTo like, \"Oh, but only sin and this,\" and I'm like, no, that's just, when you're tired, you eat Doritos, right? When you're feeling good, the tomato off the vine tastes good. I think innately, we are spiritual beings having a human experience, and at the underlying of that is a deep desire to be in full contact with reality, with each other, with expansion, becoming the fullest, highest version of ourself. And yes, that sounds super hippie, but I'm arguing, that is actually the true essence of what computing is. What is the potentials we could have that could be expanded? And that's what the Kindle sort of gave me, is I could read stuff that was nourishing to my soul. I left after three hours of that feeling way better than I did after three hours of going through YouTube. Right? Period. I mean, it's that simple. I, I feel better. And I'm more educated, and I'm a better person. It's like, it's the win, win, win. It's sort of the dopamine system done well, right? Like, you can have that. I've even found, it's, it's interesting, one of the things I've found with the Daylight too, I've found myself watching YouTube videos sometimes, but perhaps it's just that it's black and white and it's reflected, but I also suspect the videos I'm choosing to watch are informed by the medium I'm consuming them on. Which is interesting. You even think about, I don't know, I, i- it's, I, I, I- more YouTube lecture, podcasts than, uh- Right. I suppose what I'm trying to argue for is that, I don't know, I'm someone who loves film. Like, I, I, I certainly believe in the power of video or cinematic storytelling to be as meaningful as great books. But there is, it is telling that, like, what I get from a film is usually different than what I get from TikTok or Instagram. And there's a lot of reasons for that, duration, how, uh, f- attention span. But I do think it's telling that the tools, the instruments, the screens we use might actually inform what we read on them or what we watch on them. Which is crazy, 'cause it's not paternalism, it's now just... this gets at an interesting... We're, we're jumping around a bit, but I, I w- might as well, and in to some of the more holistic Daylight Vision stuff. One obvious critique from day one about what you are trying to do would be that you are trying to be paternalistic. Technology is very good at giving people exactly what they want, or at least what they think they want. Giving us more of what we want. And most tech companies, most successful businesses in the world, give people what they want. They try, they, they're rarely prescriptive. There are counterarguments to this. I think probably a good one would be the health food industry. But I would argue, at least, that eating healthy or even quitting cigarettes or quitting alcohol is probably actually a lot easier than, um, opting out of how oppressive computers can be. Right. You don't need to drink for work, but you need to check Slack for work on a computer. Right. Um, and there's that, and yet you're also clearly, as I think people have a sense of based on the conversation, you're not a Luddite. You're not anti-progress or anti-technology. Can you talk about how... There, there, the last thing I'll say on this, there's this, um, quote. I, I think you quoted it in another interview when I, I recently read the book, um, Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death. In, in Orwell versus Huxley intro, he says, \"People will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.\"\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nCan you talk about why you're not just being par- paternalistic and instead maybe you're pow- empowering people to believe in, in themselves and their own capability? I think it's... 'Cause in practice, it's not really in that frame. It's sort of outside of it. I can sort of see how people analyze it that way, but I think it's actually different.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nI'll get concrete. Let me start with the frame. If I'm somebody who makes the best forks on Earth, and I come to you and sell you my forks, am I trying to sell you forks at the exclusion of you buying spoons or knives?\n\n[laughs]\n\nAm I being paternalistic by selling you the best fork? No. That's my point, is I don't think there is, uh, by Daylight, don't use Netflix, don't go to the movies, don't do other stuff. It's more like, rather than eating with a spork and sort of doing a half-ass job about everything, why don't you use this fork?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd there's probably good times to use a spoon when you're drinking soup. There's probably good times to use a fork when you're eating penne pasta. But, like, the goal here is there should be some general education and honesty from my side and some general education and honesty on your side, on which tool for which job and which combination.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd you could argue what Daylight is, is trying to get away from the messy middle. Um, you know, like, the problem... there's no problem with entertainment. The problem is when it's need... it's not nourishing entertainment. Right? Like- Or when you're merging where you're... where you shit where you eat. Exactly. You're merging entertainment- You're shitting where you eat. Yeah. Go watch that movie and super enjoy yourself, or go be like, \"I'm gonna go binge on YouTube.\" The problem is like, \"I'm gonna try to work,\" and then you do YouTube. Or- YouTube's a swipe away, right? Yeah. And then you, like, actually never watch the movie that is nourishing-\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nThat, like, allows your nervous system to get into it-\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nTo calm down. You're always stimming. It's a musician that never has any pauses. It's just sound, right? And that's the problem with much of this. And I'm gonna try to get the chronology of this right with, um... Hopefully, it, it's clear. The profound introduction to reality that computing is, is that it is a new dynamic, interactive relational medium. I.e., it's magical matter. That's why it's got an anima. When we say it's animated-\n\nRight.\n\nIn many ways animated is animated and interactive are sort of the two key aspects. However, computing made it into the world by being a tool. Excel, Visicalc, just think of it as a business tool that you used, and then it became a Photoshop tool, and it became a, you know, a sp-... uh, making a presentations tool, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But in going from being a singular tool, which you could argue the Jacquard loom was, um, believe it or not, you programmed... This, this is the first computer, modern Western computer you could say. It's a loom, uh, that would then weave things. And the way you programmed its patterns of what to weave, is you did these incredibly sophisticated punch cards- ... where each thing is whether or not this- When was this? Oh gosh, oh, I'm bad with numbers. 17th century? Wow.\n\n[laughs]\n\nNo, no, no, no, it can't be. But definitely pre- That's after... it's... Y- you need a steam engine, you need a factory industrial power. Okay, okay. Okay. Maybe 19 or 18th century or 19th. I'm s- I'm really bad at this. But yes, think of like- Way before computers. E- England industrializing, moving from- ... you know, uh, the Luddites in a cotton mill. That's a computer. That's all... That's totally a computer. And many people talk about this as this is the first sort of modern computer. And it's, it's crazy. If you go to the Computer History Museum here in Mountain View in the Bay Area, you... they actually have a Jacquard loom demo. Whoa. It doesn't work, but you can see the punch cards, and it's absurd.\n\n[laughs]\n\nBut beside it, you see the IBM machine and its punch cards, and it's similar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It tells where the, the, the, the weave goes underneath or above, and then you can change what color it is and therefore the pattern. That was a single purpose computer, right? It did one thing, and it did it damn well. And then its change dependent on you changing the punches. And that was the original software, we're women moving the cables from one part of a computer to the other. Software in the beginning, we're women. That was what software was, right? It was you sort of made the change once, and then it was just the way it was. And over time, you could say there's almost a purity in computing that came from this. not ever... No one talked about computing, computers being bad, early computers for kids back in the day. Yo, it was literally an appliance. It was an appliance, right? this is a place you program. And sure, you could game a little bit too much or this, but it's not the same as the way you can get addicted to playing cod all night or, you know, Warcraft or something that. And I think it's because a lot of early computing was in this tool way of being. in some sense, that's a tragedy, because we forgot or missed the fact that it's actually not just a better set of tools. It is a fundamentally new aspect of reality. It's a dynamic interactive medium. But okay, you know, as Bill Gates said, \"There's a desktop on every... There's a desktop computer on every table.\" that sort of happened, right? Yes. But then over time, we're like, \"Wait a minute. This can be much more than just a set of tools.\" You can have Ableton, you can make videos, you can watch videos. And then to your point, this is where a lot of consumption started to happen. Uh, with Mosaic, you had images if... with the internet, and then you started to have audio and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Then computing sort of got confused, where it went from being, you know, the sort of the immaculate conception in the beginning of this beautiful dynamic interactive medium, that possibility of that, to then coming down to being this practical set of tools, to then slowly over time becoming a bundling of more and more and more and more tools, which then has the emergent property of being a messy medium. And then you shit where you eat, where you start adding entertainment and consumption to it. Very different cognitive modalities, right? There's like... We build our spaces where the kitchen is different than the office, and the office is different than the living room or entertainment room. Like, all of society is built around don't shit where you eat, right? And in computing- You're right.\n\n[laughs]\n\n[laughs] In computing, we conveniently forget. Yeah, environmental design is actually an incredibly, uh... one, important, but also it's everywhere.\n\n[laughs]\n\nEverywhere you go, no, no one puts the kitchen and the toilet in the same place.\n\n[laughs]\n\nRight? It's- I mean, arguably one of the main problems with remote work, like, b- the modern society is remote work actually just is bad. There you go. You've removed all the...\n\n[laughs]\n\nYeah. Right.\n\n[laughs]\n\nYou've got to break something down. And once again, it's all the constraints in the past that we only saw the bugs of- Right ... when you remove it, you also see the ways that it's a feature, right? It's the tradition is smarter than new perspective. Yes, yes, yes. And that's why our age... It's a great age of great humility, 'cause all the things that we thought were bad, we're like, \"Oh, shit. There was some wisdom in there.\"\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd you sort of have to, you know, backtrack. Yeah. But my point is, computing starts off in this glorious medium, but none of that ever conceptualizes. It just starts out, because that's how things have to start out, being legible and practical as tools... as a tool, and then it becomes tools, and then it becomes a bundle of tools, and then it adds entertainment and consumption. And now, it's this sort of messy medium. But it's also overwhelming. It be- it's, it's becomes the center- Because it's a messy medium. You have the- 'Cause it shits where it eats. It tries to put all of this together. And tools can't just be kludged all together. Yes. Right? They need to be done in a certain way. They need an underlying Batman utility belt to hold them.\n\nMm.\n\nThey need a structure. They need something around it. Right. And because there was nobody who sat down and did it, it was just everybody smashing stuff together, we got this sort of messy medium that is worse in many ways than just having tools or a tool of the past, and is worse than the sort of platonic ideal of a beautiful, dynamic, interactive medium. Yeah, and- And so- ... by the way, I would say, like, the iPhone is obviously an incredible thing in many ways, but because it combines everything, you, you both have the shit where you eat problem. You, you have this other one, you say, \"This thing is my main relationship with the world.\" Which I think is- Man, it's non-human relationship ... the other insidious part of it- ... is that it becomes o- domineering, central to every single thing. You, you... This goes back to the problem of, like, you can't... You can choose to eat healthy. You can choose to quit cigarettes. You can choose to quit alcohol. Like, actually opting out of technology feels it's opting out of society. Exactly. That's the Faustian bargain. You can't.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut the reason I'm saying this is exactly because it is miraculous. Right? In a way, it's closer to the original idea of being this medium. Yeah. Like, it is democratizing and empowering that\n\n\nLike, when I was in Burma, for somebody, their phone was their boombox, it was their video player. Yeah. [laughs] It was their newspaper. Yeah. It's how they talk to their mom. It's how they figure out what price to pay for this. It's, like, how they did everything. It was their flashlight. That's, that's the way we are. Right. Yeah. [laughs] But I was- That was just Burma. But, but point is, we could have money for some of this stuff. I see. They did not even have enough money to buy any of these things. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right? In the past, they just wouldn't have it. Which, in some sense, I think, is probably... There are aspects of that that are really, really good for the world and empowering. Computers have been amazing for agency, and the consolidation, them getting cheaper, all these things, I think it's worth noting. And to your point, that's why I'm not a Luddite. Okay. That the core of this is not like- Right. ... \"It's a messy medium, throw it all out, let's go back to having tool or tools.\" Some... Most people go through the emotions and the thoughts that... and the philosophies that you've discussed. Yes. Many people react by, by- Yes ... by opting out. And hey, I had that too. My two years of backpacking was sort of me trying to reject it all. Yeah. But you just, if you face reality, you have to face that this is... Mm-hmm. And that's where, you know, sort of we talk about it on our team is, like, the goal is not to... the first timeline. It's not the Unabomber way of going. It's not to be the Luddite and throw this all out, and go back to a past and romanticize that it was better. It's to realize that this isn't the optimal. We're in... We're a messy medium. And I mean that as a double entendre in two ways. And the point of Daylight is actually to get to that sort of beautiful, dynamic, interactive, computational medium, magical, magical matter. Actually, we sort of have to declare bankruptcy on where we are, go back to being a clean tool. But with the evolvability and wisdom, and the 20/20 hindsight of knowing, \"Okay, this is where it has to start and how it can evolve such that it become an actual clean and better medium.\" Hmm. And that's the story's story. It tried to start as a medium, started out as a tool, became tools, became messy tools, became a messy medium, and now it's just, like, overwhelming, 'cause trying to please everybody and please us, no- nobody. It's miraculous, but it sort of eats its own advantage. Well- And it's only gonna get worse with AI. To start over from a tool, and I'm arguing that sort of ability to start small and clean with the tool and have it work for you, is the best way for then evolving that, if you have the right set of principles, towards actually being that medium that computing was always meant to be. And I think that is the bigger story we're all part of, and Daylight's just trying to play a small role in that. To go back to your fork analogy and the idea of what you want this tool, at least, to be quite good at, one thing that comes to mind for me is attention. It's a product that enables me to have more power or agency over my attention. It feels the primary incentive in today's world, for every person in business, is just to capture attention, capture my attention, sustain my attention, hijack my attention. You've... I think your language may be an endless slot machine of variable reward. There's great books on this. What about Daylight, or what about tools broadly, enable us to have a positive relationship with attention? Well, I think long-term, in a way, Daylight is not solving the problem initially, because solving the problem fundamentally is super hard. It's... You gotta, like, change the dynamics of the attention economy. Right? You gotta change the underlying game theory and incentive structures here. You gotta change one's relationship to the internet. Instead of it just being fully blocked or fully available, there has to be a lot of titration. Yeah. In most of society, you don't just fully raw dog something or do it none at all. Yeah. You have a lot of stuff [laughs] in between. Yep. We don't have that right now. Yeah. So, we're toddlers. This is fundamentally new. Yep. But when it comes to attention, what Daylight is sort of doing is the benefit of starting off as a tool. So, even if I'm claiming the promise here, and what I wanna do is bring it back to being a medium, I'm sort of starting indirectly by starting with a tool, is because it's much easier. The reason it's easier is because you solve it categorically, with a fork or a toaster. You don't ever look on the front of a toaster for it to say distraction-free toaster. ... there. If Samsung gets its way, maybe in a couple of years, [laughs] you'll actually have to do that with the damn number of- I need Wi-Fi in my desk, ... touch screens and Wi-Fi they put on it all. What's the version of app for Daylight? Why, why is that the case here? that's my point, is if you actually wanna solve the things that make computers, like, sort of oppositional to you in the way it wants you to spend your time- ... it's actually a lot of problems to solve that is unrealistic for a small team on a small budget- ... to do. And frankly, for anybody. It's Gall's law, you know? If you want complexity, you have to start off with simplicity and then evolve it to complexity. Mm-hmm. All of nature always starts out simple, and complexity is emergent. You cannot design complexity. Yeah. Yeah. This is why, you know, top-down utopias never work. Yep. And what Daylight is trying to be is if you declare bankruptcy on modern computing, this sort of messy media, messy medium, what is the smallest, simplest fundamental unit of computing that is clean and useful, that captures the spirit of the bigger thing, and has evolvability towards the bigger goal? And, um, it's funny because I have a book lying around here called Friendly Orange Glow, and it's about the earliest computers, how they were these black and white computers that glowed amber. Some of the first, uh, computers were these plasma things by Donald Blitzer, and they were orange. And what is Daylight? It is a black and white computer- [laughs] ... with a friendly amber glow. Mm-hmm. That wasn't intended. It's just sort of hilarious how that happened to be. Mm-hmm. Right? Like, 'cause- [laughs] ... I pursued the principles of how to make something feel better and be healthier and sort of be my Kindle, but, you know, on steroids. And by starting small, by starting focused, you emergent get some of these qualities of it not being as addicting or distracting or overstimulating, because it's opinionated to be better at reading and writing. You don't even have... To my point of it's moving on from always dating your exes. You don't have the same grooves of swipe left, click here, Control T, before you know it- ... you're on YouTube or- Yes ... ESPN or you're doing, you're stimming that. Yeah, it's frictionless. It has a total different set of pathways. It's new- it's a new coat of snow that you get to now choose, rather than the grooves of the past. The fact that it's black and white. I'm not paternalistically saying don't use TikTok on this or don't use YouTube. [laughs] If you consent- But it's just gonna be worse. [laughs] If you consent him to buying it, you will just like... I love when people are just like, kids are trying to watch reels on it. [laughs] And they just stop, like, \"This sucks. It's boring.\" [laughs] And I don't need to say anything about whether it's good or not. Right. And it's not I'm taking away your ability to have a MacBook or a TV or an iPad, right? Yes. Yeah. It's now you have a fork versus the spoons of those other things, versus a spork that tries to do everything. And by being simple, by being a tablet, um, by being a third device separate from your iPhone or MacBook or whatever, by having these new sort of associations, you can create a little piece of your computing relationship that has a very different set of qualities to it. And I don't need to solve distraction, because I'm sort of blocking you from distraction. I'm carving you out from the rest of the world. It's a gated community of sorts, right? Mm-hmm. It's a little sanctuary. I actually haven't solved the problem. I'm just punting away from the problem. In, in terms of what it's actually really good at- But it works, 'cause it's simple. Right. It doesn't require me big braining it. Right. Right? In terms of what it's actually really good at, at least one specific articulation of, of what it's maybe good for now, you've been enamored with this idea of the primer from Diamond Age? Yeah. Is it, is it right, one, can you explain what that is? And two, is it right to think about Daylight today as sort of an early attempt at being... wha- the fork's great for eating pasta or whatever- [laughs] ... an early attempt at being whatever that is? Yes. The short answer is yes. The, the medium answer is if you know the concept of the Dynabook from Alan Kay- Mm-hmm. He sort of reinvented the tablet, one of the first personal computer manifestations. This is that illustration? The famous illustration of kids in the grass holding the thing, playing sports It's basically an iPad 40 years ago. Yes. Yes. And they're sort of smiling. And there's the joke that computing forgot about the squiggles. [laughs] In the sense it forgot about the smiles on the kids' faces, you know? Mm-hmm. Coco Melon and Subway Surfers, having your kid in a daze is not the same as them being agentic and empowered and happy. Yes. And the squiggles in the grass, they're, you know, we're stuck inside all the time. when we're outside in nature, there's a certain way our nervous system acts. While much of computing is this closed off, tight- Hunched over ... hunched over nervous system, which, you know, begets the sort of stimming. You know, when you're stressed, you stuff your face with food. You're doing the same thing with information. And you could say the main point of the Dynabook is if you appreciate computing as this new medium, then actually it can become one of the most powerful tools ever for agency, confidence, learning and curiosity, and wonderment for a kid. Because they have intact dopamine systems before we screw it all up. f- forget about the adults. We'll help them later. Their mouths are screwed up. Like, \"Sorry, you took one for the team.\" [laughs] At least the new generation is our chance to have a blank canvas and be a representation of today versus a representation of the past. That's the way I think about adults. All of us are representations of our past and the past. And therefore, the highest form of agency is to decouple the past from the present and the future. Wow. Um, and the power of a computer that can be this... It has the Bible, it has the Quran, it has the Kabbalah. It has everything you want to learn and read. It has the library of Alexandria at your fingertips, but now it has a teacher. It has a guide. It has Aristotle. There's the, um, the Bloom Two Sigma tutoring effect, which is when you have a personal tutor, you have a one or two standard deviations improvement in performance just from that individualized, personalized back and forth. And one of the ways AI could be even better, which, you know, I don't think people really explicitly talked about, is with a tutor, if you don't understand something, by the time you ask it for the third or fourth time, you start to feel embarrassed that you're annoying him. Yes. You don't feel the same- Too- ... cognitive disambition with AI. You can ask it 10 times, 12 times. You're not wasting its time. You're not this. Those subtle psychological dynamics are profound. Mm-hmm. And if a kid, rather than being confused by the world, going home, and then having to contract, 'cause there is no understanding-... rather than being like, \"Dad's angry at me and I'm bad,\" and contracting, imagine if they have this, this medium, this interface, that's available, that's endlessly patient, that we're trying to make respectful and healthy and humane, and therefore worthy of being intimate with. Um, you know, literally cra- crawling into bed with, or having it when you sit outside, or whatever it may be, you can now process this stuff. You can ask it those questions. You can go, \"Why, why, why, why, why?\" Oh wait, dad maybe wasn't angry at me because I'm bad, it's because he had a tough day at work? That ability to not shut down yourself, that ability to still stay supple, to still stay curious, for the world to still be sensible. 'Cause I think that's what happens as kids, we go, \"The world doesn't make sense. I'm bad. Ah. So, I'm just gonna get learned at being a tool.\" This is a companion that makes you comfortable. It's almost Hobbes. And... Yes! Calvin and Hobbes. I have the, the whole set in the front. Yes! Mm-hmm. Yes! That is such... Yeah, Dobby the Elf is probably less fun of an example than- [laughs] ... saying Hobbes. And is that what the... I, I, I haven't And Hobbes- ... read that at an age... ... is an amazing example because he's just an inanimate doll to the, the parents- Yes ... but to Calvin\n\n\nHe is this animated-\nHe's expensive... amazing adventure buddy.\nYeah.\nAnd so, the answer to your question, there is the, this is the future of the book, this is the reinvention of the book and the notepad and the typewriter for the dynamic, sort of, AI age, right?\nLike, there's many problems with the book where you don't remember anything, you can't double click into stuff, you can't go back and forth.\nRight.\nRight.\nIt has the problem with Socrates, right?\nIt's... Writing is decontextualized.\nYou can come away with all these misunderstandings.\nYeah, you can't be in dialogue with it.\nNo.\nNow, you can be in dialectic with it.\nRight?\nAnd a similar thing with note taking.\nThere's many ways that, you know, your ideas can now be turned digitally with typewriters.\nYou can now solve word block at Root Cause, this thing called Lex that's pretty cool doing some of this stuff.\nSo, that whole side of things exists.\nBut the, I think the deeper side of it is this ability for you to now have an outlet for curiosity or frustration or agency or expression.\nAnd rather than blocking it, the computer can be in relationship with that.\nAnd that's what the Dynabook or the primer, or primer is.\nSo, adults will buy this because they will be able to read a paper and understand it much better.\nOr they'll be able to read, you know, a patent, or they'll be able to read a report, or whatever it is.\nAnd then adults will buy it for their kids, or kids will ask for it themselves... because now, a computer can be endlessly entertainment and be fully aligned.\nBecause you're using the dopamine system in the way it's meant to be, and it's unbelievably pleasurable to be in your full curiosity and agency and wonderment.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd that's the whole thing here.\nIt's a cheat code.\nIf we can get over the activation energies, 'cause it's a win-win-win.\nYou've said that the basis for much of health is light.\nYeah.\nAnd that's clearly, uh, again sort of in the weeds, but also obviously philosophical.\nHow has that informed Daylight the product?\nYeah.\n[laughs] There's a lot of layers to that.\nI mean, one, one simple layer is there's just this famous video where they have kids in a classroom under fluorescent lights, and they're all fidgeting crazy.\nUm, they're like, \"Ah, all these kids have ADHD, and this, you know, what we've done in our society, over-medicate them all, and Ritalin and Adderall.\"\nThey then have those same kids in an outdoor classroom.\nAnd they're still sort of energetic, but there's a way it's less fidgety and it feels more embodied.\nAnd then they sort of interview the teacher afterwards, and they're just like, \"Yeah, like, it all worked a lot better.\nEverybody was smarter.\nEverybody paid attention more.\"\nThe basic idea here is we're taking the people who are sort of the most flexible, who are the most, you know, evolvable, the highest amount of sensitivity and energy, and then we're systematically telling them to contract themselves and cut off their capacities.\nRight?\nYou're putting them in an artificial over-stimulating environment, which is what artificial light often is.\nOnce again, it's because, it's a, it's a humbling.\nWe didn't realize light has all these complexities to it.\nWe just thought, \"Is it bright or is it dark?\"\n[laughs]\nWait, there's invisible light called UV and infrared that's not bad for us, but good for us?\nAnd our physiology depends on it?\nAnd wait, this thing called flicker that we can't see, but actually affects us?\nLike, sort of microplastics, you can't see it, but it affects you.\nSort of pollution, can't see it, but it affects you.\nSort of chronic disease, you can't see but it affects you.\nEt cetera, et cetera.\nIt's the same canonical set of problems, right?\nLike...\nSo, if you put people back in the natural light, if you put them back where their nervous system, you're not trying to crush it or contract it, but their nervous system is actually in relationship with the environment, suddenly you get a lot more expanded version of that human.\nAnd that ADHD is now sensitivity to their classmates, to their own emotions, to the teacher, to learning, to noticing their own doubts and asking questions about it.\nYou got regulated, curious, agentic kids.\nWhat more would you want?\nRight?\nAnd therefore, there is a big underlying trend to this, which is if you don't respect Maslow's hierarchy, stuff doesn't work.\nThis is why Magnus Carlsen sleeps well and meditates and eats well and exercises and does all of that.\nEven though his entire livelihood is based off of his brain, even if he didn't care about his own sort of happiness and just wanted to be the best chess player, he still respects Maslow's hierarchy and does all these things from nervous system, to mental health, to cognition, whatever.\n'Cause that is the basis for performance.\nYou have to have internal alignment.\nWe are a foundation and all these layers matter, right?\nEvery aspect of the car can be good.\nIf the transmission's not good, the rest is always gonna be slowed down.\nIf you didn't sleep well or whatever it may be.\nSo, it's a similar thing for, for, for all of us, which is we're actually deeply implicated at both a physiological and cognitive level by some key variables from the environment we have underestimated in the past 'cause it's invisible.\nMm-hmm.\nYes.\nLight being a big one.\nTemperature being another one.\nSound.\nUh, magnetism, electricity.\nThis guy named Michael Levin who I'm, he's gonna win a Nobel Prize going after...\nWe've been after the hardware development languages and biology, focusing on DNA.\nAnd we've forgotten the JavaScript and software development languages and biology, which is electricity and magnetism and things that.\nUm, that's its own thing, but-\n[laughs]\n... but we're sort of realizing like, wow, there, there is...\nOnce again, these things are invisible we never see it.\nYeah, we're, we're just way less attuned to them.\nYes.\nBut, um...\nIt's sort of a kid who's just like, \"Oh, I didn't, like, increase my score in this.\nThis was a waste of time,\" versus an adult that loves the invisible, right?\nThe intangibles of- of relationship, of comradery, of a beautiful sunset, blah, blah, blah.\nthe focus on light was simply the thing that I thought most impacted me, and then the hope was it sort of impacted others also and therefore was useful to them amongst the totem pole of the things that affect you broadly.\nAnd, um, yeah.\nAnd a great way to, from a very tangible product sense, I- I've often joked to people like, \"The daylight is sort of just a screen.\"\n[laughs]\nLike, everything else is a bunch of, kind of mediocre things in the s-\n[laughs]\nAnd in some sense that was the primary place to really differentiate initially.\nYes.\nI- I see that as a great compliment when you're like, \"The sc- it's basically a screen with a bunch of mediocre things.\"\nI'm like, \"Oh my God, fuck yeah.\"\nWell, it's- it's focus.\nIt's you actually focused on the thing that mattered.\nBecause you can't compete with these trillion dollar companies-\nYes\n... or hundreds of billions of dollar companies that have insane armies of people, insane supply chain leverage, insane amounts of experience, insane amounts of specialization, insane entrenched effects.\nYes.\nIt's completely unfair game.\nGood luck.\nNo chance.\nEven Microsoft couldn't make mobile phones, or Facebook couldn't do it, or Amazon couldn't do it.\nif you put it into perspective, people who have unlimited money have been unable to break into personal computing.\nIt really opens your eyes.\nthe fact that we on 1,000 if not 10,000 times less resources made something-\nYes\n... that people that maybe use instead of an iPad-\nWell- well this is an amazing segue.\nIt's like, ah.\nOne of my very, very favorite philosophies that we've chatted about is from Gunpei Yokoi of Nintendo, who created the Game Boy and Game & Watch, uh, which translates to, \"Lateral thinking with withered technology.\"\nTechnology.\nYeah.\n[laughs]\nCan you talk a little bit about, just maybe to get in the weeds of like, actually making the V1 and how you use some of those principles?\nSure, yeah.\nIf- if I could just quickly close the point on light.\nIt's not I sat down and said, \"Light is the most important thing.\"\nOnce again, it's just my Kindle felt different.\nMm-hmm.\nAnalog things felt different.\nRight.\nAnd only afterwards, the sort of right drunk was the intuition of just going with that feeling.\n[laughs]\nAnd the edit sober was like, \"Holy shit.\"\nOh.\nLight determines a lot of our dopamine response.\nIt determines a lot of our breathing rate, of our nervous system state.\nThere's many ways the light sets mood.\nThere's a reason that, you know, SAD lights and things that matter.\nAlso, these-\ntrue\n... are, these devices are literally just screens anyways.\nYes.\nYou touch things and light changes.\nYes.\nAnd now you can speak to them and then light changes or words come out, right?\nit's sort of fascinating.\nYes, at the essence of a computer is what you touch and the light that changes.\nif you want to change a computer, change the touching part or the light part or both.\nWe will get to the touching part one day soon.\n[laughs]\n[laughs]\nHey, the word digital means, uh, touch, right?\nDigital.\nI didn't know that.\nYour fingers, your digits.\nAh, wow.\nYeah.\nThe essence of digital should be touch, but it's actually the opposite of touch.\nIt's- it's- it creates distance.\nHmm.\nBut once again, it's computing is seen as the most dehumanizing thing.\nMm-hmm.\nBut actually it could be the most humanizing thing.\nMm-hmm.\n'Cause it's a medium, it's not actually something else.\nUm,\nyeah.\nEssentially I, 'cause I wasn't trying to build a company, I was just trying to solve my own idea maze.\nI had a lot more time to get down rabbit holes.\nI wouldn't have done this if I was to be practical.\nIt just would require too much willpower.\nWell, you also just inherently were super constrained.\nYes.\nYes.\nWhich is the opposite.\nBut my point being-\nSuccinctly is the mother I mentioned.\nYes.\nBut that- that sort of came second.\nLike, once I had an idea, the constraint then, you know-\n... sets the stage.\nRight.\nBut why, even where did the insights come from?\nIt came from me just being super curious about what is exactly this Kindle thing and why does it feel different?\nHow can I understand that?\nIf I understood it intuitively, let me understand it analytically.\nI learned about light and I learned about blue light and I learned about Flicker.\nAnd then I learned about reflective objects and saccades and how our ocular system is built to understand things.\nAnd by the way, our, it's our perceptual system for symbols, letters, is based around a perceptual system based around paw prints and things of nature.\nit's sort of interesting to see.\nThose are 2D projections of 3D concepts, and that's what a symbol is.\nUm, just learning deeply sort of how our cognition is being utilized and why it's different in this.\nAnd I'm still mostly in questions versus answers.\nBut at the root of it, I just started to read a lot more textbooks about optics.\nI started reading textbooks about display technologies.\nThere's emissive displays, there's projection displays, there's reflective displays, then there's tangibles displays.\nOh, that's interesting.\nThere's a whole category that's not just the Kindle.\nOh wait, Kindle's not even E Ink.\nE Ink is just a brand name.\nIt's called actually an electrophoretic display.\nOh wow.\nThe whole category is called ePaper and there's plasmonic resonance and then there's Mirasol and then there's this and then there's that.\nAnd then I read a book from the '90s and then they talked about this technology, which is called reflective LCD or memory LCD.\nAnd I'm like, \"Eh, LCD, let me skip this.\nThis doesn't sound...\"\nBut then I- and I read it, I'm like, \"Wait, wait a minute.\nIt creates a white pixel by reflecting light and it creates a black pixel by blocking light.\"\nWhoa.\nThat's the same as an electrophoretic display.\nWhat's the problem?\nOh, okay, it's got five billion problems.\nHuh?\nThis is what was used in the Game Boy?\nOh, I remember my Game Boy.\nOh, I remember angling it to get it perfectly in the light, but also it was cool.\nYou could see it in the sun, and also you could dial up its little light on the side after the Game Boy Color and then you could do it.\nAnd I was like, \"Oh, that was kind of cool.\"\nI- I had fond memories and it sort of worked.\nAnd you're right, the Game Boy was fast.\nIt wasn't as slow as my Kindle.\nDuh.\nUh, but what happened?\nWhy'd everybody forget about this?\nOh, because, um, immediately went to the Game Boy Color.\nAnd the problem with, uh, going to color is the brightness of these display things with the old color technologies, they were very, very dim.\nWhich is why in the Game Boy Advanced SP and the DS, they switched away from these sort of, these e-paper reflective LCD screens.\nBut the first Game Boy was actually black and white.\nUm, the analogy goes deeper because I'm literally imp- implicating, you know, Nintendo here.\nBut they switched over to color quickly, there was actually not that much evolutionary gradient around the black and white Game Boy screen.\nMm-hmm.\nMm-hmm.\nMm-hmm.\nYeah, they took a different tree.\nIt's almost like...\nThey took a different tree.\nIt's almost nobody else had the presence or, um, uh, resources or on.\nI think the one, the one lineage here is the Playbite actually kind of carried some of that over.\nYes.\nLike, what, 30 years later?\n[laughs]\nSure.\nYeah, almost.\nYou go to 20...\n[laughs]\nIt's weird.\nYeah, yeah.\nThe- that is a perfect example.\nAnd actually, um, the\n\n\nPebble Watch actually also.\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nUh, there's these little...\nTalk about missed tech trees and th-\nThere's a little... And\nby the way, the first-\nThey're bringing that back?\nYes!\nThe first eReader was not the Kindle.\nThe first eReader by the founders of Tesla, believe it or not-\nWow.\n... the founders of Tesla created the first eReader, called the Rocket Book.\nUh-huh.\nAnd it was actually an ePaper thing.\nBut ePaper sucked much back then.\nHuh.\nThat basically it got abandoned.\nUh-huh.\nAnd I started to just, I just saw the first principle's numbers of the technology, which for a display is basically about you have to resolve information.\nTo resolve information, you need difference.\nThe essence of difference is contrast.\nWhat contrast is, is how much light does a black pixel reflect?\n'Cause if it reflects all the light, then it's white.\n[laughs]\nIf it reflects none of the light, then it's black.\nAnd then how much light does a white pixel reflect?\nIf it, uh, if it reflects none of the light, then it's black.\nIf it reflects all the light, it's white.\nAnd that difference is what makes a screen, right?\nAnd then you put stuff on top of it to give it color, but the essence of a screen is the difference between how much it can not reflect and how much it can reflect.\nThat's the s- fundamental binary.\nAnd then there's something called reflectance, there's something called viewing angle.\nThere's a bunch of stuff that comes out of it.\nBut you sort of go like, \"Wait, from first principles, this thing is actually...\nIt works if it's black and white.\"\nIt does not work with that set of technology if it's color, but it's almost no one ever analyzed it for black and white.\nAnd yes, there's these little pockmarks here and there, but it sort of, you know, never got bigger.\nAnd then you realize there's many.\nAs you read the literature, you reach out to the professors, you go the conferences, you realize there's a whole litany of problems of why this was abandoned and thrown in the garbage heap.\nRight.\nIt's just sort of this old Japanese technology that was meant to be promising that was thrown away.\nBut it's just sort of how Kevin Kelly talks about, like, what technology wants.\nI just started researching this, you know, end of 2018, beginning of 2019, and some of the fundamental material science breakthroughs came in papers that were 2005, 2007, 2012, 2015.\nDecember 2018 was one key breakthrough.\nAnd, uh-\nNobody was paying attention.\nAnd nobody was paying attention.\n'Cause who pays attention to something that 30 years later, like, that's suddenly gonna work?\nThere was actually a bunch of crazy people who cared for five years and 10 years and 20, and then they lost interest.\nAmazon tried for a long time.\nEverybody did.\nRight.\nBut at some point, you have to just admit when it's 18 years later, like, \"Phil, this is not gonna work. Let's give it up.\"\n\"Okay, Bob. I guess we will.\"\nBut there's these insane Japanese professors who will keep at this shit literally for 30 years-\n[laughs]\n... when there is no market, no reason.\nYeah.\nAnd it goes back.\nThat's the opposite of the, \"Instagram got sold. Let me do-\"\nYes.\n\"... Instagram for cats.\"\nThe Japanese professor thwacking away at this, with literally zero potential benefit in sight, in sh- in, like, medium or short-term sight, is actually the root of what is potentially a lot of bountiful innovation here.\nAnd frankly, they did the hard work persisting at this stuff for 20, 25, 30 years.\nAnd what I did is I just got lucky at combining papers from a bunch of different fields.\nSome of them were not in the display field.\nProfessor from the Netherlands, from Florida State, from Germany, but a bunch of the main work was from Japan.\nPut it all together and said, \"I think this may solve the 20 problems you talk about.\nThis may solve the, the six major problems you talk about.\"\nGuys, d- was anybody paying attention?\nIt's almost society's missing a thing that says, \"Great idea,\" but missing this, and there's nobody to keep track of that.\nAnd I just got really lucky.\nProbably many such cases.\nProbably a lot of such cases.\nI mean, I...\nIt's a silly example, but baseball just had this kind of hilarious moment where this guy invented a new bat called the Torpedo Bat, and he was, like, an MIT guy or a PhD somewhere, and he ended up loved baseball, decided to become a baseball coach.\nAnd the Yankees debuted the season this year.\nThere's all these regulations about the wood bats in baseball.\nIn youth baseball, they go crazy with the materials, but in pro baseball you have to use a wood bat of a certain size and certain weight.\nAnd they shifted the, like, girth of the bat to, like, closer down the barrel where the, you hit the ball, and they made the top of the bat more narrow.\nMm.\nAnd the ba- the, like, the Yankees have hit more home runs.\nThey hit more home runs in, like, the first five games than any team in history.\nWow.\nAnd it was just this...\nNobody had thought about it.\nJust like...\nI, I think it's...\nUh, it's funny, I talk about this with my friend, Chris all the time.\nThat's a water park of agency right there.\nThe notion that obviously in certain areas markets are incredibly efficient, but there are also these little pockets where it's just, oh, nobody decided to look.\nWell, mar- markets are efficient in adjacent possibles-\nYes\n... things that exist.\nYes.\nTo things that are uninevitable, to things that are more in the dark, they're terrible at it.\nMm-hmm.\n'Cause markets are mostly a convergent process.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd the essence of any search space is divergence.\nMm-hmm.\nBut then, of course, you can't just be an idealist forever, which is-\n[laughs]\n... you have to converge.\nBut, uh, that's sort of how I got this.\nI self-taught myself display stuff and, uh, just basically, I'd say most of the credit goes to the, the crazy Japanese folks.\nAnd I just sort of pulled it together.\nBuilding on the shoulders.\nSo...\nYou are not a trained product designer, but you, along with Tanoosh, lead design at Daylight.\nCan you talk about...\nYou, you rely heavily on intuition.\nYeah.\nCan you talk about how you use feel as a guiding principle in design space?\nI think, once again, it's sort of there are people who go entirely off of feel, but then there's the sort of, like, actual feel, and then there's, like, the sort of intention feel.\nActual feel is, like, truly it's a bottom-up intuition and it's a machine learning model synthesis of a lot of stuff.\nIt's a high-dimensional thing.\nThat's why you can't put it in words, it's beyond.\nYeah, there's wisdom there.\nBigger than words.\nYes.\nThen there's, like, the fear-based feel, which is sort of, like, you're overwhelmed by complexity and you're afraid.\nAnd it's much easier just to be like, \"This.\"\nAnd the answer is, you have no idea what it is, rather than living in that question.\nWhich one of those is a gut decision?\nWell, I'm arguing that one, this is the positive version of a gut decision and the failure mode-\nGot it\n... of a gut decision.\nGot it.\nMy, my point is, oftentimes when people say they're going by feel, actually they're using that as a cover-up for they can't handle the uncertainty or they don't even know.\nAnd so, it's really tough.\nOne is this highly intelligent, wise gut decision?\nYes.\nAnd the other is reactionary.\nEx- ex- exactly.\nAnd then the, uh, I love this as an overall principle for life, is like, how do you know if you're doing it right or wrong?\nOr you're, it's like, are you in fear and tension, or are you in suppleness and sort of expansiveness or love, if you wanna be a hippie about it?\nBut it actually sort of, in any damn circumstance, that as a heuristic captures it.\nYeah.\nLike, are you lying to yourself and it's just like, you want it to be this way 'cause it feels safe or better?\nOr is it true, just, is like, is your body tense?\nOr is it free?\nAnd I think oftentimes, I judged feeling because I think I was sensitive enough to notice most people were hiding things under feeling.\nIt was more in the tense version.\nIt was not the grounded, expansive version of feeling.\nAnd so, um, I went the opposite.\nFor most of my life, I've been hyper-analytical, hypo, let me falsify myself, super left brain.\nAnd I think I actually built a lot of my machine learning model that way, is I literally would read every review of every phone and e-\n[laughs]\n... sort of, you know, bit neurodivergent.\nHTC, like, you know, 10 comes out, or M8, read every review, Engadget, Gizmodo, Verge, read all the comments.\nYou know, when YouTube reviews started to become a thing, just sit there and scroll for whatever, however long it takes to read the comments.\nAnd I just like-\nBy the way, those are inputs to taste.\nYes.\nYes.\nBut-\nBut there's also... yeah.\nBut it didn't, it- it, yes, exactly.\nThat's where, that's where I was sort of dissociated from my right brain and feeling side.\nI was entirely on the left brain side, which in many ways is sorta sad and painful, but in many ways is an incredible stamina training exercise.\nYes.\nYeah, 'cause-\nYou're building an important foundation too, of, of prior knowledge and context.\nTo your point, it's the training data that then creates the, the other things.\nNow I learned you can actually build your taste in much more higher dimensional ways, right?\nObserving somebody or feeling yourself when you do something, et cetera, et cetera.\nThere's more data streams.\nBut at the time, and I actually think a lot of my confidence to sort of go from feel comes in because I sort of at some level know I've put in the work on the analytical side, and I've done it for long.\nYeah.\nI mean, may not be that old, but the mileage, the amount of time I've done that.\nUh-\nAnd by the way-\nAnd-\n... you've also done a lot, I mean, to talk about something specific, you presumably looked at a lot of weird types of screens.\nNot only read reviews about them and read about them.\nOh, I went to all the-\nBut looked at them...\nacademic conferences.\nI read the papers.\nI'd be-\nRight\n... part of the plenums.\nI would be the weird kid where everybody'd be like, \"What?\"\nUm, yeah.\nI asked the dumb questions nobody else asked, and I asked the dumb questions that people were like, \"Holy shit, why did we not ask that?\"\nBut I, I think that sort of the ability to edit sober, of then being analytical about many things then gave me the room and the space and the confidence to then relax into myself and then have that right drunk.\nAnd that's where that feeling comes from.\nFlute reverbs and stuff too.\nYes.\nBecause it's Picasso, right?\nHis early stuff is all very formal.\nYeah.\nI don't mean to [laughs] compare myself to Picasso, but the point I'm trying to draw here is, he then got to break the rules over time as he understood it.\nHe could transcend them.\nAnd it's sort of once you understand the speeds and feeds and specs and you can hold a lotta d- variables in your mind and calculate them all, you quickly realize, \"Okay, the left brain analytical is a classical computer.\nIf I wanna get to the next level, I need to increase the data streams.\"\nAnd by the way, me feeling when I use a to-do list versus reading 500 reviews about it, there's actually such a massively higher bit rate.\nthe-\nYes\n... amount of information you get-\n... from that.\nYes.\nIf you're sensitive enough.\nObserving somebody when you're in the bus and just seeing the way they scroll their phone or they look out the window or just the expression.\nYou know what I mean?\nThere's just like-\nMm.\nYou're deducing something at a level that's hard to put into words.\nYou can say, \"Oh, I can notice they're slightly anxious and they're doing this,\" but at just some level, you're getting a deep warmth, a deep, warm data stream.\nAnd then when you can sorta compute with feeling, you're a supercomputer, you're a quantum computer.\nIf w- if the, if the analytical is computing with 10 dimensions, 10 variables, this can compute with 5,000 variables.\nRight?\nIt's not machine learning with 10 million, but it's a lot.\nPotentially it's also 10 million as well.\nBut therefore, you can't really easily put it in words.\nHmm.\nAnd I think what I've realized is, as I've now created these capacities on both the left and right brain, the key is the sequence.\nIf you start with the analytical, it immediately converges it.\nIt lowers the viewing point to a pin, pinhole.\nIt sets the light in a very small portion of the space.\nAnd therefore, if you can write drunk, you can show up with feeling or intuition.\nAnd you've done the work to be sensitive.\nThe, uh, not, I don't recommend this for most people.\nI don't recommend this for myself, because you have to clean yourself up.\nWe were saying, when you're under fluorescent lights as a kid and people yelling at you, you close down.\nYour entire system is built to close down all your natural sensitivities.\nYou have to remove all that sludge and clean it all up.\nAnd it's hard to survive society now when your sensors are all-\n... very sensitive again.\nRight?\n[laughs]\nYeah.\nUh, it's night vision goggles.\nIf somebody actually puts light on you, it friggin' hurts.\nOh, wow.\nIt's-\nInteresting.\nIt hurts much.\nAnd it actually will break the sensor.\nYeah, you almost might come to not want that sensitivity.\nYou're trained to...\nYeah.\nExactly.\nAnd then the essence of sensitivity is also learning how to recover and integrate and also-\nYes\n... not be sensitive you become the fear-based version of a special snowflake versus the expansive version.\n\n\nOf a special snowflake.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd I now see it as a much more profound computational tool.\nThat's what feeling is, 'cause it's, when a machine, when a GPD 4.40 answers you, it's done from intuition.\nThat's the right trunk.\nBut then you see how powerful 03 is because that's the edit sober of reasoning on top of that intuition, right?\nAnd so, you lead with the intuition, and then you wait a day or you wait a minute or you wait five minutes or you wait a week, or whatever it may... and you try to reason through it.\nAnd then you realize, \"Oh, that was motivated reasoning.\nOh, I was lying to myself in this way.\"\nYou know, it's half of the process is just f- facing your own demons that way your internal tools are actually useful.\nAnd then you're able to compute far better than others, 'cause I think the reason product is hard for most people is it's just got many variables that are interlinked.\nLet's focus on-\nYes, you're actually very attuned to your taste.\nYou... And, and thus you can make quicker decisions, you can make-\n... more complex decisions, et cetera.\nThat's kind of what taste is, in a sense.\nYeah.\nI haven't thought about that too much.\nThat's really interesting.\nWhen you hear these, you g- you read those Ken Koszienda, Steve Jobs pitches or whatever, and Steve's decision-making seems to be incredibly like... there's not a lot of sitting around wondering how he feels about it.\nHe knows exactly how he feels when he sees a prototype.\nWell, it's because also I, I don't know him.\nI've talked to people who have spent a lot of time with him.\nUm, there's a lot of preference falsification between the Isaacson biography and-\n[laughs]\n... how people who have worked with him describe him.\nBut, uh, um, there's a great Huxley quote.\nI promise I'll connect it.\nIs... He says, \"When I travel to a new place, I try to read nothing about it.\nI try to know nothing about it.\nAnd I try to spend just the first couple days wandering through a place with my eyes and my heart and not my brain.\nI want to see things and have the direct experience of it.\"\nDon't want to...\nHe didn't use these words, but I'll use them.\nLike, he didn't want to read Lonely Planet or TripAdvisor and be like, \"Oh, that's the famous temple that's this and that.\"\nAnd instead of actually feeling the temple or seeing it-\nTrying to match the territory to the map.\nYes.\nYou're relating to it with your brain through your cognition.\nAnd the problem with that is cognition is inherently way lower dimensional-\nYes\n... than feeling, right?\nIt's if you've ever seen an un- an uncompressed MP3, it's insane how frigging huge even the simplest of songs is as a file.\nYeah, or a WAV fi- I mean, I have WAV files of this podcast.\nIt's 10 gigs.\nIt's like... It's insane, right?\n[laughs]\nYeah.\nAnd so, that's, that's what real life is.\nYeah.\nIt's a shit ton.\nYeah.\nAnd most of the world of the digital or cognition is how do you reduce things?\nYeah, thank, thank goodness our brains are good at compressing.\nYes.\nIt's amazing.\nBut also if you wanna sort of expand yourself, it's to actually get back, yeah, the map and its ... territory matching.\nAnd so, I think the point where Huxley's saying here is he wants the full high-bandwidth direct experience of stuff before his cognition then just comes and puts layers, right?\nBy the way, there is a point to later on in product design or whatever it might be to actually decomp- doing the compression.\nAnd it's sober.\nRight.\nRight?\nBut write drunk first.\nDon't-\nRight.\nA- and it's like, I think what Jobs is trying to do there is the beauty of that direct experience that you have before the cognition sets in-\n... is incredibly precious and incredibly rare-\n... 'cause it's not reversible.\nYes.\nMaybe you take psychedelics, it's reversible.\nMaybe that's the future of product testing.\n[laughs]\nTaking psychedelics and those...\n[laughs]\nBy the way, that's one of the best validations of Daylight ever, 'cause people love it way more on psychedelics-\n[laughs]\n... than, uh, iPads and stuff.\nYeah.\nThat's funny.\n[laughs]\nUm, and, but, uh, my point there is like, it sounds maybe he's brash or overconfident or impulsive, but if you think about the mileage Jobs had in computing-\nYes\n... for how frigging long.\nIf you think about the mentors he had, people Bob Noyce, the founder of Intel, and just some of these... Alan Kay and some of these early folks.\nYou think of the amount of smart people that he was receptive to.\n'Cause I met some of these people, and, and when I, when I asked them about him, they say he was good at listening.\nEverybody knows him as being arrogant, but he was actually very sensitive and good at listening.\nYou think of the sheer amount of receptivity, the machine learning model that was built over that time, the number of products that failed.\nThink of NeXT, think of the Lisa, think of many of the different Apple desktops that were created along the way.\nmany things failed, right?\nyou... He, he had such mileage of learning.\nThis is why the Tony Fidels of the world try to be Steve Jobs and totally fail.\nThis is why many of the young people who try to be Steve Jobs totally fail.\nThey don't have the mileage he had.\nAnd early Steve Jobs failed a lot too, right?\nBut once you have built that machine learning model, when you can interact something with direct experience rather than cognition, you are such a powerful-\nYeah, there's much high-dimensional wisdom there.\nRight.\nAnd that's how customers relate to something.\nYeah, he ha- he, he has the receptivity of a child and the wisdom of somebody who spent a lifetime on it.\nYes.\nAnd, and the anger of a Khan.\n[laughs]\nUh-\nBut I think that's the essence.\nWrite drunk, edit sober, and the skill building necessary to be able to do that, I think the essence of product design.\nYeah.\nHmm.\nIt's beautiful.\nSo, even if I'm not trained, because I've sort of built my inner technologies, I think I can be somewhat good at this stuff.\nI don't actually consider myself a designer.\n[laughs]\nTinge is, uh, a genius-level designer.\nUm, he sort of is what makes things come real.\nBut I think I sort of birth the, the space of it.\nHmm.\nWell, I'm not gonna compare you to Johnny and Steve, but-\n[laughs]\n... maybe I just did.\nDo...\nCan we talk a little bit about the future of Daylight from a product standpoint?\nThere, I guess there are three categories that stand out to me.\nAnd obviously some of this might be cards close to the chest, but there's hardware, there's software, and then there's maybe what we'll call intelligence that anyone making computers is thinking about today.\nI would never actually separate out software and intelligence.\nHmm.\nI think actually what they are is just an anima or a set of animas in the Noosphere that you then choose to instantiate onto different objects.\nMm.\nMeaning an operating system is no longer a hardware abstraction layer in the world to be.\nIt is this sort of Patronus, this thing that lives in the Noosphere, in the sky, that then comes down to Earth onto your objects.\nBut it's not an operating system for a tablet and an operating system for a watch.\nIt's a different version of that thing in the Noosphere-\nHmm.\nThat's cool\n... that then instantiates self on this thing.\nThat's cool.\nIt's sort of the positive version of Horcruxes from Harry Potter.\nRight.\nYeah.\nAnd the hardware is the container for that and it's-\nYes.\nYes.\nBut it's this bigger thing.\nSo-\nIn terms of, just to go back to, again, the analogy of, like, you're, you're trying to make a fork.\nYes.\nWhat are the things that if...\nTo the extent you're willing to talk about it, what are the things you're most excited about productizing for Daylight in the near term?\nDo you want me to answer your previous question on this one, or just jump into this one?\nEither way.\nYeah, you can take on either, or either or both.\nPu- pull me in if this is too big picture.\nSure.\nBut I, the way I think of it, and it's funny you say, like, \"Is it cards too close to the chest?\"\nI'm like, we're doing nothing new or original.\n[laughs]\nIf you just go to the '60s and, like, hear what they said, like, I have a Nicholas Negroponte book called, like, Soft Machines or The Architecture Machine.\nLike, everything I say in real reality it's, like, written out there.\nHmm.\nLike, forget internet things, forget ambient computing.\nJust, like, read that stuff.\n[laughs]\nLike, you want a new idea, go read an old book.\nThere is nothing we're doing-\n[laughs]\n... that is new.\nmy, my step-mom-\nI don't even understand the idea of the\nAnd he brought up, uh, Erehwon, talking about, like, AI and the machine, and it's 200 years old or 150 years old.\n[laughs]\nIt's just everything, everything people\n[laughs]\nIt's just all...\n[laughs]\nI di- I didn't know that.\nUm, I call it the four dimensions of daylight.\nwhat we have right now is we have a dot, right?\nAnd what I'm trying to argue is there's a dimensionality, a light cone, a space that emerges from that.\nHmm.\nOkay, bear with me and I can maybe try to get simple.\nBut the zero, the zero, zero of that space, the dot is, I would call the finally personal personal computer.\nA Maslow's computer is another way to put it, but it's basically whichever dimension you take computing, the essence of it should actually finally be personal.\nHmm.\nWhich to me means it's healthy and respectful and wise and understanding of a human at all layers, physiology, nervous system, cognition, memory, you know, soul, whatever you wanna say, intellectual.\nAnd anything you do, whatever form factor it is, if it does not have this identity, I think it's fundamentally missing much of the possibility of computing that augmentation.\nMm-hmm.\nHmm.\nthat's the sort of s- core vision is-\nSomething in that m- Hearing you say that makes me think of almost a computer that you're, d- not to sound weird, totally okay having, like, intimacy with.\nYeah.\nLike, being intimate in space with.\nYeah.\nAnd obviously, I, I think almost all of us who have an iPhone, there's a lot of intimacy there.\nIt's never not on my body.\nYeah.\nBut I don't feel great about it.\nYeah.\nWell, it's sort of, once again, we were saying, like, the messy middle.\nThe problem with everything is not the concept.\nIt's sort of the broken version of it.\nYeah.\nLike, most people when they say-\n... like, \"I go by feel,\" they're actually going by ego.\nThey're just in fear.\nIt's when people are like, \"Oh, computers should be intimate.\"\nIt's like, computers are actually intimate today but in the wrong way.\nYes.\nLike, most, if you look at the Pornhub trends, most people watch porn on their phone in the bathroom.\nLike-\n[laughs]\n... what's more intimate than that, dude?\n[laughs]\nBut it's like, it, it's not necessarily the form of intimacy.\nI can't judge if it's not necessarily the form of intimacy we all hope to, to have.\nRight.\nRight?\n[laughs]\nit's like, it's not we're asking for new forms of intimacy that doesn't exist.\nWe're just asking for the better, more expansive versions of it-\nYes\n... rather than the exact versions.\nOkay, the personal personal computer.\nThe personal personal computer.\nAnything we do, whether you make a watch or a tablet or this, it has to have this identity or it's a failure to me.\nit's Steve Jobs did the fif- first 50% of Alan Kay's vision of a personal computer.\nYou can sort of say what's on the table now for us as a technology industry, us as Daylight is to do the other 50%-\n... of what it means to make a personal computer.\nGuess what?\nAI, in enabling something to be animated, to be intelligent, to be relational, really, really, really, really helps and makes possible a computer being personal.\nAnd we can talk about that next.\nThen that's the zeroth identity, and then what are the dimensions of Daylight?\nI think the Z dimension, the depth dimension, if you take the Daylight computer, this tablet, and you take it to its logical extreme, what it becomes is the primer or primer or dynabook, which is this magical book, this magical notebook.\nIt's the future of reading.\nIt's the future of learning.\nIt's your little companion.\nWho did you... who was the reference?\nHobbes.\nHobbes.\nYes.\nhalf of it you could see in the, the, the perspective of sort of knowledge work.\nIt's thinking and learning and curious.\nIt's the mind augmentation.\nThe other side you could sort of see it in development, right?\nIt's the thing that helps you keep your morning routines and evening routines and learn art or practice music or, you know, do your affirmations or gratitude or express yourself in a new way.\nSo-\nIt's an instrument\nYes.\nIt d- Yes.\nThank you.\nThe Z axis, is it becoming an instrument and it actually becoming this magical book that c- science fiction has talked about forever, that Alan Kay has talked about forever.\nThat's the depth dimension.\nYou take Daylight as the tablet and you take it to its extreme, which is profound, right?\nLike-\nCan you just be, um, specifically, like, give us a few examples of either hardware or software or apps or, like, what, what things...\nWhat are simple ways that the current product could be more of that?\nLike, the AI feature you teased for reading books as an example?\nYeah.\nExactly.\nimagine you're reading something.\nYou don't quite understand it.\nYou just hold down the physical button on the right side of the tablet.\nYou don't need to change your\n\n\ngrip, and\nyou can then just tell it, \"What the hell does this mean?\" Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.\nYou don't need to copy and paste.\nYou don't need to do this.\nAnd then without losing context, it sort of just brings the little dialogue layer on top of it, and you can go back and forth and interrogate it.\nAnd now there are things that can create diagrams, you know?\nThe new 4O image generation goes a long way.\nThere's a guy named Zain Shah.\nHe has a thing called tma.live.\nIt basically makes you a custom Khan Academy video for the specific question you asked.\nWow.\nUh, like, you know, the whiteboard style it teaches you.\nCool.\nImagine that sort of a thing.\nAnd then what it can do is then say, add this.\nLike, \"Hey, do you wanna actually remember this thing or are you done with it?\"\nAnd we made that interface really simple to do.\nEven the way you close it.\nOne way you close it just means I'm done with this, and one way says I'm done with this, but please add this to my knowledge base.\nYes.\nAnd by the way, one of the things-\nAnd then six months from now it brings it up, or three months, you know?\nOne of the things we didn't talk about much in the beginning but is sort of implicit to how much of w- why I think you chose to work on Daylight is that when you build hardware, you actually get to go to the source of operating systems and software, and that's what enables...\nObviously these types of features you just described exist in different contexts today.\nBut the problem is unless Apple decides to do them, they're not integrated.\nRight.\nIt's the A- it's the Alan Kay quote, \"Those who are serious about software build their own hardware.\"\nThat's especially true in the age of AI.\nWhy?\nBecause all the possibility space available to being a-... uh, a website in the browser, a web app, or the possibility space to being a mobile app or desktop app.\nIt's sort of, like, almost fully expanded into, and AI just, like, fully commoditizes and makes that happen.\nYes.\nYes.\nSo, if you want to actually have a software product that's differentiated or better, you need to go to new possibility space.\nAnd literally, if you have to make your own hardware to make that possibility space accessible, to be honest, that's way cheaper than spending, like, a crazy amount of money on customer acquisition or spending a crazy amount of money on training these crazy AI models, right?\nMm-hmm.\nSo, I think a lot of [laughs] people realize, like, you have to develop the capacitive hardware to do the software and stuff they want to.\nAnd, like, I think it'll be a huge reclamation of like, \"Wait, hardware is not as hard as we thought it is-\"\n\"... in many ways.\"\nHmm.\nUm, most of what makes it hard is not hardware, but decision-making, to your point, right?\nYes.\nBeing a hardware person's akin to being more an investor, 'cause you g- i- if you're wrong, you're dead.\nSo, you have to be right on your core main things.\nIf you do software, you can be wrong 99.99% of the time, but if you stay long enough to iterate until you get it right, you sort of make it.\nSuper different.\nSuper different.\nSuper different.\nOkay, that's the Z axis.\nSo, that's the Z axis, yes.\nSo, just imagine, like, a notebook, you can write things into it, r- and, uh, i- it captures everything you've written.\nIt cleans up your handwriting.\nIt makes it digital.\nIt puts it into your Notion or wherever you want it.\nUh, anything you put a square box beside that's a to-do, it adds that to your to-do list, on and on.\nImagine a handwriting version of Granola, if people are familiar with that.\nIt's an instrument that meets you exactly where you are.\nFor these sort of knowledge, learning, thinking, expression things.\nYes.\nThat's the Z axis.\nUm, the X and Y axis, of course, is like, well, what's the other set of products that we do, right?\nIt's not just a tablet.\nThere's other things that should be a finally personal, personal computer.\nWhat do we do?\nA phone, a this.\nThere's the obvious ones.\nWe'll make a monitor.\nWe'll make a phone.\nBlah, blah, blah.\nYou know, those type of things will happen.\nThat's sort of obvious.\nQuestion is, how niche will that be?\nThose are interesting things.\nBut to me, it all fits in, in this X-Y, where the X is what I would call, like, real reality, and the Y is what I'd call Harry Potter computing.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd... 'Cause it's literally, like, spatial, right?\nLike, you make the space smaller, a tablet becomes a phone.\nYou make it even smaller, you can put it on your wrist.\nIt's an... you know, a watch.\nYou make it bigger, it's a monitor.\nYou make it even bigger, it's a whiteboard.\nLike, literally, a tablet, in many ways, is a canonical primitive of computing that you can stretch-\n[laughs]\n... right?\nAnd make thinner-\nSure\n... or heavier or foldable or whatever it is.\nYeah.\nUm, a laptop's a tablet turned sideways put into a keyboard.\nLike, uh, I hope this doesn't sound as ra- as rationalization, but actually, it's sort of true.\nYep.\nIt is the simplest unit of computing.\nYeah.\nBut to me, what that means is it's not virtual reality where the computer is your environment and you stick your head inside of it.\nYes.\nIs... Your environment is the environment, and the computer then submits itself-\nCloser to ambient computing.\nYes, the computer submits itself to your environment, to your... to the, to the space and headspace that you want.\nThe set and setting that you're trying to do.\nAnd therefore, the room around me as you're seeing with all these Post-It notes and, you know, pieces of paper up in the wall and things, what if those can be computational?\nSome of these should probably just be paper for the long term, but some of these could benefit-\nYeah, or maybe-\n... from being computational or dynamic...\n... there's obviously the Bret Victor dynamic land stuff.\nBingo.\nSo, there's different, kind of, takes on it, but-\nSo, what, w- in our internal thing, we, we, uh, we reference the dynamic land and, you know, sea spaces.\nBret Victor, OG.\nThat's real reality, right?\nLegend.\nRight.\nLike, screw virtual reality, let's have real reality.\nAnd that always early writing, by the way, is exactly what you said, it's about like, let me pull my, like, let me make the computer object rather than being subject to it and sticking my head in the...\nAnd look, VR is fine if you want to go have some immersive experience and you wanna like-\nTeleportation\n... get s-...\nBut the idea of that, you're gonna put that on your face for 10 hours a day, and you're gonna come home, and you're gonna relax by putting another thing on your face?\nTo me, that just doesn't make any sense.\nI wanna...\nAnd I, I really genuinely, uh, having used the Apple, the Vision Pro a bit, like, it is teleportation.\nIt is about going somewhere other than where I am.\nRight, right.\nWhich is totally fine and can be good.\nI don't wanna do that.\nIf I'm spending most of my day trying to be somewhere other than where I am-\nRight\n... I think there's a problem.\nThere you go.\n[laughs]\nThat's the essence of it right now.\n[laughs]\nAnd, and, and by the way, I would say the iPhone is basically virtual reality.\nRight.\nI, I often joke to people.\nI, I catch myself, like, I'm sitting on the toilet on my phone, and I black back in.\nLike, I, I realize that I'm staring at a piece of glass and I'm in my body, and that's, uh...\nI don't have that as much on the Daylight, which is nice.\nAnd once again, I think it's less because we designed something brilliant, and it's more we started from something very small and simple.\nYeah.\nRight?\nAnd-\nYes\n... you sort of learn what things actually cause the problems as much as it gave the features.\nOkay, we have X-\nSo-\nX axis is real reality.\nWhy?\nReal reality.\nSo, just imagine more computational surfaces-\n... They can be really small or big.\nMark Weiser called these pads, tabs, and boards.\nHmm.\nUm, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're sort of a whiteboard, that when you walk in front, it gives your week's calendar.\nYep.\nAnd then also has your to-do list.\nYep.\nOr when you're trying to, you know, do what your trainer taught you, it's got your exercises on it.\nYep.\nWho knows how much of that will work in black and white.\nDo we have to evolve the color?\nUh, the other, the Y axis is what I call Harry Potter computing.\nBecause actually, you don't need every aspect of magic.\nYou know what?\nTo me, computing is the essence of, to be a surface, to be visual.\nRight.\nRight?\nUm, and it doesn't even need to operate on you necessarily with symbol or with voice.\nIt could also operate with your smell.\nLike, Harry Potter computing to me is taking the magic of computing and infusing it into more objects.\nHmm.\nSo, imagine Philips Hue light bulbs that, like, didn't suck.\nYeah.\nTo me, that could be super powerful if combined with the Daylight.\nWell, this is like, um, little...\nUh, I don't know, the brick you put on the back of your phone.\nYes.\nOr differe-\nYes.\nUh, a stylus or-\nYes.\nThey're analog objects that are magical.\nYeah.\nAnd that's why I call it Harry Potter computing 'cause it's Tom Riddle's diary or the Marauder's Map.\nRight.\nOr it's in the Beauty of the Beast, the candlestick holder that, you know-\nYeah,\n... moves around.\nCool.\nIt's the moving paintings.\nYeah, maybe it's robotics.\nUm, could be.\nThat-\nYeah.\nActually, our internal slogan for pro- for our product vision is building psycho technologies for health, learning, agency, and flourishing, or H.L.A.S.H.\n[laughs]\nSince I'm secretly Danish.\nTrue story.\nAnd, uh, I the word psychotechnologies 'cause it means it's not just about computers.\nIt could be an incense holder that, when you're tryin' to deep work, it puts on a smell that it knows for you is, will put you in a deep work state.\nNeroli, for example-\n... for some people, it puts them in that way.\nRight.\nOr it's light bulbs that, when you're tryin' to wind down, it slowly-\n... it's synced to your alarm-\nIt wouldn't seem-\n... and your Google calendar, and it, it starts to slowly dim itself down.\nI can totally imagine...\nI mean, one of the things that I, I think is just credit to the brand you guys have built is that I can imagine Daylight selling a range of products that aren't-\n... computer products, including whatever, um, furniture or whatever, but also-\nIncense holders.\n[laughs]\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAn incense holder, like, which is, which is, um, you're pointing at a direction of, of...\nI mean, you've u- you...\nTo, to make it explicit, you've used the framing of a third timeline or calm computing or...\nThat somewhat which point very explicitly at computers, but a lot of it points just as a, um, a lifestyle maybe.\nYeah.\nAnd that's...\nTo complete the sort of four dimensions of Daylight is zeroth dimension is a finally personal personal computer.\nThat's the identity.\nThe Z is, it become a Primer or Dynabook, the ultimate version of a book, you know, comes with its own teacher and notebook.\nYeah.\nThe X and Y is sort of computational surfaces in appropriate places-\nRight\n... in respectful ways around your house.\nRight.\nI think the, the Y is computational objects in appropriate places in respectful relationships to the other objects, to yourself, and other people.\nBy the way, operating systems need to be redone when it assumes multiple users, multiple places.\nOperating systems are per device.\nThis is an x86.\nThis is an ARM.\nThis is one user profile.\nWhen you have something that's in the news sphere, when you have it when the house where other people are there, whether family or communal, you have to have totally different security models, totally different ways operating systems are built.\nthere's a lot of technical primitives that emerge differently if you assume this vision.\nYeah.\n[laughs]\nyou can towards that, right?\nYeah, you've got your work cut out for you.\nOh, it's a lot, but it's fun.\nHm.\nAnd then the last and final fourth dimension is sort of what I would call that, which is this sort of optimism.\nThis overall move towards what I call the third timeline, which is not the first timeline of Luddite and Unabomber and screw all this and let's go back to the woods, and not the second timeline of the Marc Andreessen, e/acc, like, go, go, go, go, Nick Land accelerationism, acceleration, and we're all gonna lose anyway.\nWe might as well just, like, go gung ho into it and solve all our problems with technology, which I think ends up as Brave New World.\nIt's you've rung up a really high, high score.\nGDP is high, life extension is high, you, you're a trillionaire, but, you know, you're dead inside.\nTimeline one, you're dead on the outside 'cause a tiger may eat you or you might get sepsis-\n... without antibiotics, but you're alive inside.\nMm.\nTimeline two, you're alive outside.\nIt's Brian Johnson.\nYou look a million bucks.\nYou literally spent a million bucks on that.\nYou're a trillionaire.\nYou, you know, you got every...\nYou got a 12-pack, but inside you're dead.\nThere's some way in which optimizing for all those metrics, your soul is dead.\nAnd the third timeline is how we can sort of have a beautiful harmony between the future and tradition, between the top down, the bottom up, the masculine, the\n\n\nfeminine, between the technological\nand the natural by... Between this\nalive outside and alive inside.\nAnd the hope is Daylight is part of the\nsame trend that is Chick-fil-A to KFC.\nTo me, that's the third timeline.\nIt's the sort of mass\nempowerment of society.\nWhat makes Chick-fil-A to KFC?\nI consider that very third timeline.\nUh-\nWhat, what... I don't know what you mean.\nOkay, what I mean is basically KFC,\nyou know, served the ecological\nniche of, like, great fried chicken.\nOkay.\nBut it sort of was shitty.\nLike, it pandered to you, right?\nIt's oily.\nIt's salty.\nYou feel shit.\nAnd Chick-fil-A is the,\nis the miraculous one?\nWell, it's an evolutionary pathway.\n[laughs]\nI, I... Maybe, maybe, yeah.\n[laughs]\nHey, as a former Chick-fil-A,\nuh, cashier or drive through guy-\nOh.\nOh, damn\n... I, uh, I don't know if I'm honored.\nI don't-\n[laughs]\nYeah.\nWe, we definitely haven't reached\nthe terminal state of that timeline.\nBut Chick-fil-A does not use\nthe same sort of bad seed oils.\nI'm not claiming that\nthey use amazing stuff.\nOkay.\nOkay.\n[laughs]\nTheir stuff, their stuff is just coo-\nI think this... The point is\ngreat, the metaphor is okay.\nIt's a work in-\nUh, Chick-fil-A to me\nis a quality upgrade-\n[laughs]\n... in fried chicken that is\na more glorious future.\nOkay.\nOkay, okay.\nIt's an increment.\nAnd, and, and Hoka One One's\nversus Allbirds and, you know-\nYeah.\nYeah, yeah, yeah,\n... you can go on Birkenstocks\nversus, you know-\nYeah.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nI'm with it.\nAvianas.\nI'm with it.\n[laughs]\nBut my point is we're sort of re-\nlearning to make wiser choices-\n... that\nare in between, in between these extremes.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd then the goal here is,\nas a world, we're doing that.\nAnd then we're just trying to see\nwhat does that mean for technology.\nMm.\nAnd sort of to your point, if the promise\nof technology was this beautiful medium\nand we ended up in a messy medium, how\ndo we get closer to a beautiful medium?\nAn integrated one, right?\nAn integrated-\n... holistic\nmedium.\nI have a few questions about\nbuilding Daylight the company.\nIt's been a slog.\nIt's been six years.\nSeven years.\nSeven years?\nSix years since it officially started,\nbut, uh, about seven years since-\nWhat have you learned about yourself?\nOh, man, uh, that I lie to\nmyself all the time, that-\n... I'm\nfull of shit.\n[laughs] I'm a horrible person.\nI'm very harsh to myself.\nUh,\nI, I have a lot of demons.\nThe entire process has\nbeen very spiritual,\nand, uh, in many ways, if I have strengths\nnow as a leader or as an individual or a\npartner or a future dad, it's because, I\nthink, of the intensity of this process.\nAnd if there's one thing I'm proud\nof is in each moment of, like,\nheartbreak of... Company nearly\ndied, like, six or seven times.\nHonestly, maybe even more.\nI don't mean, like,\nsort of metaphorically.\nLike, I was out of zero.\nLike, I was down to no money.\n[laughs]\nLike, [laughs] PPP loans was the k-\n[laughs] the key way that Daylight\nkept going at a certain period of time.\n[laughs]\n[laughs]\nGod bless the money printing machine.\n[laughs]\nThere's always some\npositive externalities-\nYeah, yeah,\n... and negative externality things, right?\n[laughs]\nUh, it's just, like,\nyou either can contract or you\ncan sort of, like, let go into it.\nMm.\nRight?\nthat sort of surrender.\nAnd, um, I think the one quality I\njust had throughout it is I sort of\nnever lost my faith in the world, not\nin the way it meets me, but in the way\nI felt I saw it behind all the layers.\nMm.\nSort of an adult that's mean,\nbut, you know, underneath,\nlike, he's still a child.\nMm.\nHe still have a good heart.\nLike-\n... most\nof the world's not evil, you know?\nThey're just hurting or they're scarce\nor this. So I somehow kept my faith,\nand it stayed supple in each situation\nthat could have closed me down.\n0\nMm-hmm.\nAnd I think that allowed me to keep\nshowing up, keep being nourished by\nthe few people, the few things that\nwere rewarding, that were powerful,\nthe, the few breakthroughs that\ngive you the childlike excitement.\nLike, I did something that Amazon\nhas spent tens of millions, if\nnot hundreds of millions to do.\nAnd like, no way, I haven't done this.\n0\nYeah.\nTaking stock of that too.\nI have no idea what I'm doing.\n0\nOf the incremental progress.\nRight.\n'Cause it, when you do it, something\nfor that long, and you bootstrap it,\nand you don't have a co-founder in your\nparents' basement, and you know, you\nhave very little resources and all that.\nAnd I think one thing I learned is\nsometimes a very few set of qualities\ncan be a complete instruction set\nif you can stay supple enough that\nyou don't get sort of closed down,\nand then lose that evolvability.\n0\nMm-hmm.\nAnd by instruction set, what I\nmean is like, your Intel or ARM\nprocessor, it has, I'm just gonna\nmake up a number, 64 instructions\nthat it then is able to act on with\nthe actual transistors of the chip.\nIt can add, it can multiply, it\ncan jump, it can concatenate,\nit can flip, whatever, whatever.\nAnd basically every program\nyou write gets turned into a\nseries of these instructions.\nAnd when it says 3.6 gigahertz, it's like,\nit can do this many instructions per that.\nAnd I think the problem with\nmost of us is reality is tough\nto us, we start to shut down.\n0\nMm-hmm.\nAnd it allows us to be\neffective in narrow ways.\nIt's the lizard that can escape\nthe snakes, but your, your\ninstruction set might become 42.\nAnd guess what?\nFor the most part, you can get away\nwith having an instruction set of 42.\nIt looks there's no sort of discernible\ndifference, except at a soul level.\nYou sort of, like, know there's a\npart of you you've cut off, a part\nof you have abandoned, a part of\nthe world you've now lost wonder in.\nI think the problem with that is when you\ndon't have a complete instruction set,\nyou can't compute over all of computing.\nIt's a Turing-complete machine.\nIf you have a f- complete instruction\nset, you can do all of computing.\nAnd over time, the ability to do\nall of computing is actually what\nallows you to have great capacity-\n0\n... evolve and pioneer things.\nEven if in the short term\nit doesn't look much.\n0\nMm-hmm.\nAnd I think the combination of sort of\nhaving faith, staying supple, feeling the\npain, feeling the heartbreak, feeling the\nfear, always being curious and humble,\nalways assuming, trying to falsify\nmyself, searching for the best teachers,\nyou know, doing the work, listening\nto the whispers, whatever it may be.\nI feel even if I was, I lacked in a\nlot of ways, I somehow had the set\nof qualities or I chose such that\nI had a complete instruction set.\nAnd with that, even if it may\nbe inefficient and painful at\ntimes, you can sort of bootstrap\nyourself into all the other things.\n0\nMm-hmm.\nYou can bootstrap yourself\nto learn about displays.\nYou can bootstrap yourself-\n0\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nIt's an energy\n... to have the stamina to\nfigure out fundraising-\n0\nPositive energy\n... to learn how to recruit, to, to do it.\nAnd\nmaybe my biggest takeaway is like,\ndon't be harsh on yourself, because that\nmight crush your main ability, which\nwas to have a complete instruction set.\n0\nMm-hmm.\nIt may be incredibly inefficient.\nThe harshness may be useful for efficiency\nin the short term, but you're dramatically\nmore inefficient in the long term if you\ndon't have a complete instruction set.\nMaybe that's an arcane analogy,\nbut I think it captured something\ndeep for me in my own reflection.\n0\nMm-hmm.\n0\nHow have you grown as a leader?\nI think the biggest thing is like, if I\ndon't actually trust myself to lead my\nown life, how can anybody else trust me?\nAnd it's not even whether\nthey trust me or not.\nI don't trust that they will trust\nme, 'cause I don't trust myself.\nAnd it's sort of like, as above,\nbelow, like, above, below, as above.\nIf I don't have these qualities\nin myself, it shows up.\nYou become a tyrannical leader 'cause\nyou're afraid that no one actually\nrespects you because you don't\nrespect yourself, that you have to\npunish and do things and do that.\nAnd I thought that was\nthe way the world is.\nAnd now I realize no, no, no, no,\nI j- just literally don't trust\npeople will ever listen to me unless\nI force it down their throats.\n0\nMm-hmm.\nWow.\nBecause I don't listen to myself.\nI've often denied that feeling.\n0\nYep.\nAnd I think the biggest acknowledgement\nas a leader that was hard was\nlike, \"I'm terrible at this.\nI have no idea what I'm doing.\nI'm hurting other people\nactively in the process of this.\nI'm making a lot of mistake, it's a\nf- mistakes that are affecting other\npeople's lives.\" I'm trying to do\nhumane tech, and I'm like, sometimes\nbeing inhumane. Like, \"I'm a hypocrite.\nI'm a contradiction.\nI suck.\nI should not be doing this.\nWhy does anybody join this team or give\nme money?\" Like, \"This is a, a farce.\nIt'll all fall apart.\"\nAnd it's sort of the Charlie Munger\nthing where he's like, \"The one\nthing I wanna know is where I'm\ngoing to die I never go there.\"\n0\n[laughs] Yeah.\nIt's sort of admitting upfront\nhow terrible I was as a leader-\n0\n... became the main instruction set-\n0\n... of how to then become a better leader.\n0\nMm-hmm.\nAnd I would still say I'm 95%\nin the question, but I think I\nrelate to myself as a leader, as\nsomebody who is learning leadership\nis not actually a set of skills.\nA set of skills come and they emerge.\nAnd a lot of the time me and you\nspend outside of this is sort of\nhow to build those skills and the\ntactics and the, the day in, the\nday out, and the week out, week out.\nBut I think the bigger, deeper\nthing was sort of, um, ownership.\nUm, integrity as defined\nby owning your word.\nwhen I say something, do\nI actually believe it?\nDo I actually trust myself?\nUm, it's doing something\nthat's uninevitable.\nUm, do you accept the fear of that\nand therefore the exhilaration of it?\nOr do you sort of shut down the fear and\ntherefore the exhilaration and therefore\nyou don't, then don't have the energy\nto actually push that part of reality?\nAnd so-\n0\nConversely, the other side of this\nthough is incredibly attractive.\nIt's what makes people\nwanna follow leaders.\n0\nIt's a gravity.\nYeah.\nWhich is sort of, um, the\ncraziest thing about life.\nIt's you get the thing that\nyou no longer want, right?\n0\n[laughs]\nonce you're like, \"Oh, I'm depressed, I\ndon't care about success or validation or\nthis, I just want mental health,\" and then\nsuddenly then success starts to show up.\nUh, \"I'm not interested in girls.\nI'll be fine.\" And then people\nthen all wanna ask you out.\nAnd I always think of-My favorite\nversion of this as a leader is,\nlike, Jon Snow from Game of Thrones.\nYeah?\nLike, what makes him amazing\nas a leader is he's the-\nHe's the\n... reluctant leader.\n[laughs] Yeah.\nAnd it's like, ambition used\nto be considered a bad word.\nLike, if you read historically,\nit's always somebody ambitious.\nIt still is in Europe, no offense.\nReally?\n[laughs] We just are kind of\ngetting... But kind of not.\nBut, like, it's, like, considered\nthe best thing ever, right?\nIn every college essay, \"Oh,\nI'm an ambitious person.\" But\nthe idea behind ambition is you\nare trying to, to get something.\nAnd the problem with that is\nthen leadership becomes a way\nof meeting your own needs versus\nserving a role with others.\nRight, right, right.\nRight?\nAnd the drunk... The, the sober\ndriver in the group of five people\nwho are all drunk, he's a leader.\nThe mom who's taking care of\nher four kids is a leader.\nI think one of the greatest\nleaders in society is a mom.\n'Cause life or death, they're\nliterally responsible 24/7.\nAnd so,\nthat ability to sort of reluctantly\nbe a leader, I feel is the\nessence of good leadership.\nBecause being a leader\nsort of sucks in many ways.\nIt's you're a dad to all these people.\nYou're, you're sort of a steward\nof great responsibility too.\nYeah, and it's lonely and it's asymmetric,\num, because you're trying to lead, right?\nIf you only met people where\nthey are and where the world\nis, you wouldn't be leading.\nBy definition, it's asymmetric.\nHmm.\nSo, I don't know.\nThere's a way in which I feel if I meet\nleaders and they're not reluctant of it,\nsome part of me that doubts it a bit.\n[laughs]\nSo...\nThere's a idea that Apple is sort\nof Steve Jobs with 10,000 lives,\n[laughs] which I think maybe can be\ninterpreted as an egocentric thing.\nI don't n- necessarily read it that way.\nIt's sort of what do you want\nto imbue into this organization?\nWhat, what life, what DNA\ndo you wanna imbue into it?\nWhat kind of company do you\nwant to build with Daylight?\nWhat kind of company\nyou want Daylight to be?\nI think the short answer is, I'm\nnot sure, which is sort of fun.\n'Cause I have a set of, like,\nwants and feelings and principles,\nbut sort of the Rellikate thing,\nI'm, like, living in the question\nof, like, what that means.\nAnd maybe that's why we'll be able\nto build the company that I may\nwant or I can, you know, feel,\nbecause we\n\n\nWe're not trying to construct it, right? You actually don't build a company; you grow a company. It's not metal. It's not sheet metal you bend and put together; it's a garden. And like, it's such a... I have, like, four plants, and it's, like, the hardest thing in my life to keep them alive. [laughs] Running the company. [laughs] You got a lot of light in here too. You have no excuses. [laughs] I got a New York apartment with one window. Definitely easier said than done, but yeah, it's m- very much... It's like, it's raising a family or, you know, gardening. It's like, you can put inputs, you can cultivate, you can nurture, but ultimately you have to... You can just grow; you can't control. And what is the organism we want to grow? I always call a company an organism. It's, it's a super organism. I think the three principles I have is, one is slow company, um, which is not meant to be slow company as the output, but slow company as the input. I'll, I'll maybe explain what I mean in a second. The second one is sort of, it gives back more than it takes. I think at the end of the day, company literally means company. It's bringing together people in a way that is beneficial, not just for them, but for their community and for the world. Uh, that's what all the cells in your body do, right? They... It's... If they're selfish for itself at the cost of everything else, that's called a cancer. Cancer is not intrinsically bad; it's actually life. It's just selfish; it doesn't give a shit about the rest of you and will take as much as it needs to. The cells in your body, they stay alive, or at least their organ or tissue does, and it supports the bigger organ they're part of, and it supports the entire body. It's just a beautiful alignment between all the biggest to the smallest. That's ultimately what companies should be. And the fact they're not just means there's a lot of cancer. That's like, yeah, if we're in a toxic environment, there's lots of cancers. That's not a comment about people or the way we organize, but about the environment. And the second one is sort of how do you re-, um, reclaim companies as a soc- social technology for getting things done effectively and aligned? And I think if body and nature can do it, we can do it also. It's just super hard because the principal-agent problem, which is what cancer is, you know, your interest versus a group interest. This is where, like, things religion and being part of something bigger solve this at, like, you know, root cause, they go a long way. But there's something about Daylight sort of redefining what it means for a company to be sustainable, to be scalable, to compound, to have sufficient resources. It also sort of have positive externality. You know, you could say the main problem of most companies, it's negative externality, and, you know, positive in the ways that are legible and negative in the ways that are illegible, right? [laughs] Horrible for all the people that work there, and then they go home and they're bad parents or whatever it may be. And then the third way, [laughs] which might sound a little more lowbrow than the other two, is if we're all billionaires, where would we work, how would we work, and what would we work on? And there's a way, if you just assume that if Daylight could only hire, like, non-fucked-up billionaires. [laughs] Or all the people around us, because of AGI, are all billionaires. What would they work on? How would they want to be treated? What would they want their teammates to be? What would they want to be part of? And I, I'm like, \"Okay, if I was a billionaire, like, what would I do?\" And then, like, it just sort of filters away all the bullshit. All the like, \"No, guys, let's just fucking do all this stuff, because then we can get this growth curve to hit the series B.\" You're like, \"I'm a billionaire, I'm not gonna fucking do that.\" David Zinner has this inversion of that classic question, \"What would you do if you had a billion dollars?\" Which is, \"What would you not stop doing for a billion dollars?\" Like, what- Oh, beautiful. ... what is the thing you're gonna hold on to? Yes. Which is, I think, uh, actually helps you see it a little more clearly. Beautiful. And that's what I want. At the end of the day, I... Maybe more times than [laughs] I to admit, I'm very clearly a child. [laughs] [laughs] As, as you've seen. Uh, I'm just trying to have fun. It's my dojo, it's my little sandbox. Yeah. I love gadgets. I love learning about humans, the psychology, the biology, the philosophy, the bigger story. And here's my chance to, to try to make stuff based on my theories, based on my curiosities. And do people it? Am I right? Am I wrong? I love that accountability of reality. And I think that's what the essence of investing or entrepreneurship or being a scientist is. You love and trust reality much, you're willing to be held accountable to it. Mm-hmm. 'Cause you assume the re- relationship is reciprocal. Wow. And so, yeah, I just want a place that I can make awesome stuff for a long time to come, whether it'd be incense holders or new forms of computers. And, uh, I don't know, I love, I love when you see a- a- a new parent and you ask them, \"How are you?\" And they're like, \"Terrible. I'm never been sleep-deprived. My eye is twitching.\" And I'm like, \"But how do you feel?\" And they're like, \"I've never felt more satisfied ever.\" [laughs] There's something about building things that is similar to that. Yes. It's in each moment you're like, \"Why the hell am I doing this?\" But it just gives you a- a sense of purpose and meaning and a personal dojo for your spiritual evolution that I think very little else matches. You, obviously, some of this question in the answer you just gave, but why should someone want to come work with you at Daylight? I don't know, it's probably a bad setup for the relationship. [laughs] Like, uh, if- if- if Daylight's a good fit for you, probably everything we do in our power is to anti-sell it to you, and then you still want to show up because you think the fundamental principles are good enough. Mm-hmm. It's sort of what you were saying about the thing, the screen's awesome and everything's mediocre. It's like, maybe Daylight, the core principles are awesome and a lot of stuff is mediocre- [laughs] ... but you sort of believe in that awesomeness of that core. Yeah. I think it's optimism. I think that's actually the fundamental thing here. Optimism, that I c- when I say slow company, I mean like, I think there's gonna be very little competition for what we're doing. Most people might think I'm naive, \"Ah, Amazon's gonna do this and Lenovo's gonna rip it off and Remarkable's gonna do it. You're a crazy kid. You're gonna kill your company 'cause there's no...\" That's a longer discussion, but I think there's actually very little competition for this, what we're doing, and especially the way we're doing it. I think our main competition's ourself. And in a Peter Thiel sense, if you assume there actually isn't that much competition, then you don't need to rush the same way and be the first mover or go for a network effect. And if you assume the greatest moat here is actually just long-term compounding across vertical integration, basically, you know, what a Tesla or a SpaceX does, or Apple, you know, famously does, Rivian and DJI are getting close to that. You can't catch up to that. It's like, it literally just takes long, you know, if you have high quality drivers and you have great supplier relationships and you have great color theory in your operating system, every detail is done in a particular way and, um, you just can't do that. If you can build something that is slow and builds with quality, I think you can build a place that people wanna be at, that is far more effective, everybody's nervous system is not shot, it's less political and bitchy and crap. People actually can spend time with each other, you can build relationship, and you can take advantage of AI, 'cause what does AI do fundamentally? I think what it means to be an AI company is not to make a foundation model. I think it's to reshape a company with- with the idea that AI can change a lot of the stuff that makes a company shitty. What's the primary thing that makes a company shitty? Scale. They just get big. Dunbar, it's past the Dunbar number. You have all these weird bureaucracies and principal-agent problems and you get cancers and, you know, it's just annoying and too many meetings and overhead, and it just sucks. If you can stay below the Dunbar number, and maybe it's different if it's remote versus in person, like, I got to ask Robin Dunbar this question and he said it's still a TBD. Wow. Yeah, it's pretty cool. [laughs] Um, but the power there is if AI allows you to have less people doing a lot more, and therefore you have a lot less meetings, a lot less people, and a lot less bullshit, I think that's what it means to be an AI company, is you can be fundamentally smaller and more humane in the same sort of social setups we've been set up for a long time. To me that is like, yes, we're all billionaires and of course we would want a place that. You don't want something small you can't do something of impact and you don't want something big that you got all these bullshit meetings and nonsense and, you know, performance and politics. So, it's there's no such thing as an electricity company, every company uses electricity, but the companies that were the best at using electricity were the ones who then changed their private, or their previous modes of operating with the assumption of, okay, electricity allows machines, it allows lights, it allows this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Similar thing, what assumptions and the way we build businesses change when you have AI, and I think the simplest way to capture it is you go from Sam Walton's, the- the Walmart founder's schedule, which was 17, 18 hours a day of working, flying from Walmart to Walmart, auditing each one, keeping it accountable, doing it, and, um, no amount of tool would change him showing up from Walmart to Walmart to Walmart to Walmart holding that quality and accountability and that performance and execution. It was literally just, he needed to put in the hours. It's a factory worker, he need- he just needs to put in the hours. But compare that to Einstein, who is slept 10 hours a day, went for long walks, slept with his secretaries, like, enjoyed himself, had fun, thought about things, got lost in thought. Sam Walton is more the Edison, 99% perspiration, 1% inspiration, and Einstein's 50% perspiration, 50% inspiration. I mean, with AI it's 90% inspiration, 10% perspiration, that's what robots and AI is. And if you want a company that allows for inspiration to actually be effective and to be integrated and whole, you need a different pace. You can't be busy all the time. You need moments for proflection, reflection, some of the things Daylight is trying to do. And I think a lot of the best future workbooks are about how you design a day and how you design a calendar when you're a knowledge worker, but it's no longer about the sheer number of hours you put into something but, you know, uh, leverage, as Naval says. It's being wise, it's making good decisions, having great ideas. And so, that's what I most want, is now companies can be un-shitty, potentially, because of AI, because we understand interpersonal dynamics better, because, um, we each sort of do the work, and if the part itself is whole, then they can be much better part of a whole. I have a handful of miscellaneous questions that we'll run through as we turn the corner. Okay. [laughs] Is there a type of app that you really hope someone will build for Daylight that isn't you? Yes. There's a guy who's actually doing it right now. It's funny, he's a Harvard MBA but he's ac- he's a John Lasseter type o-auteur. Okay. serve in the army, incredible, like, animator and game maker and...You know, he's going to Harvard Business School and also self-taught coder. And basically what he's creating is AI interactive fictions that are sort of the early adventure quest games of computing. It's funny again. We're starting from the beginning. Mm-hmm. Essentially it's more engaging than a book, but it's more educative than infotainment. Mm-hmm. And essentially he has these AI drawn characters and animations and you choose your own adventure. And it's a book you talk to and you make decisions and each of the characters interact with you. And it's you're write- you're writing a letter to King Arthur and you get a envelope back and he writes it back, it all looks beautiful in black and white. And I'm like, \"Holy shit. This is the primer.\" This is making education fun and engaging. That i- i- that to me is the most mind-blowing thing here is if we go five years ahead where a bunch of kids are using this, they will not look less happy than the kids today playing Subway Surfers. Yeah. [laughs] They will actually be more happy during, before, and after. Yeah. And to me that's profound. It's funny, Alex Hsu, who founded Musical.ly, he originally wanted to make an education product that was more engaging. Really? Yeah. And TikTok is amazing for education in many ways too, right? It's not just a- Well, more in China probably, due to different kinds of- Oh, 'cause the, uh, the, the defaults are different. Huh. So, yeah. And it's telling that that guy's developing it for Daylight.\n\n\nYes.\nHe talks about an iPad versus Daylight world.\nHe gave that speech in his Harvard Business School class.\nReally?\nAnd they're all like, \"You're insane. You're gonna fail.\"\n[laughs]\n\"Why are you building on this thing that sold, you know, 5,000, 6,000 units far? What are, what are you doing?\"\nAnd he's like, \"I'm either crazy or I'm onto something.\"\nMm-hmm.\nThat warms my heart because frankly, Daylight is the underlying substrate or medium.\nIt's then people then taking that... and then having opinions, then crystallizing it into something.\nAnd, uh, that, yeah, that to me is the primer come alive.\nThat's funny.\nMy next question was what, maybe there's part of it in this, you, we also talked about the Socrates problem, the written word.\nWhat do you think books will look in 15 years?\nI think we'll decompose the book into the actual underlying thing it is.\nLike, sometimes when we read a book, it actually should be a coach combined with an integration into your Google calendar, combined with an integration into your timers and reminders, combined with being able to stick up stuff on your bathroom wall and, you know, your front door.\nYeah.\nAnd we're reading it as a book because that is the best wisdom delivery device we have in our society.\nOr it's just the business model for the author.\nOr bus- right, right.\nOr status model for the author.\nRight, sure.\nRight.\nYou get the- you take a blog post, you make it a book, or whatever it might be.\nWell, this is the classic thing is like, oh, I just, new book, listen to one or two podcasts, you probably got the gist.\nYes.\nYeah.\nHow do we then take it outside of sort of the contortions it is and break it down to, oh, we want a wisdom delivery device for you.\nMm-hmm.\nYou need something that hits you with enough salience, personalization, and examples that you crock it, and repetition helps.\nRight.\nAnd then you need something that then helps you implement that into your life, right?\nWe have Tiny Habits, we have BJ Fogg stuff, we have James Clear stuff, like, Atomic Habits.\nLike, we sort of know these sort of behavior, action, nudge, trigger, some of the stuff.\nHow do you put it into your world?\nThis is where real reality is powerful.\nYep.\nIs you bring compu- you bring reminders and nudges and things you're trying to develop yourself into.\nAnd so, um...\nCool.\nYeah.\nWhat books have been most influential on you?\n*Brave New World* was profound 'cause it sort of taught me what a pyrrhic victory of technology is, which is we win in every dimension that we think matters, and we're ultimately dead inside and lose.\nAnd, uh, it felt much of my life was this 12-year-old boy energy.\nOh, it's simple.\nWe just make people smile more and laugh...\nIt just was... and happier and make GDP go up and lifespan go up and save more lives.\nAnd I'm a good boy and I've done a good job and the world's better.\nAnd much I think what it means to grow up is you appreciate darkness and pathos and the shadow and the difficulty and, you know, the things that are not numerical, not legible, sometimes that appear bad but are actually good for you.\nSort of like, uh, yeah, it's wine tastes shit and then over time you're like, \"I love this bitter thing with complexity.\"\n[laughs]\nAnd, ah, the touch of cedar.\nMm-hmm.\nSo.\nCool.\nUh, you talked about Alan Kay, maybe Mark Weiser as well.\nAny other influences maybe especially outside of technology or computing?\nYeah, many.\nUm,\nI think there's these two woman leaders, Jan Birchfield, who runs something called Antara Taos, and, uh, Kamala Devi McClure, who runs some, uh, is a teacher at something called ISTA.\nThey were just the first examples of what, like, extremely powerful, compassionate, integrated, holistic leadership looked like.\nI didn't realize most people who I thought were good leaders were more Don Draper charismatic types.\n[laughs]\nThat's actually not leadership.\nWhere other people are great managers... where other people are successful.\nThey, you know, people sort of give them a lot of status and regard.\nWhen you actually meet somebody who's a profoundly good leader, it's an emotional, spiritual, nervous system experience to be in their presence, where you feel they're gonna hold you to be the best version of yourself, but they're not judging you.\nAnd it's love.\nMm-hmm.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd it almost sounds spiritual gur- guru-esque, but they're the opposite.\nThey're grounded and humble.\nThey're not trying to disempower you to give them power.\nAnd to me that was just profound 'cause it sort of was eating a tomato off the vine for the first time.\nYou're like, \"Oh my God, this is what a tomato tastes like?\"\nIt was like, \"Oh my God, this is what leadership is?\nOh my God.\nThe future of humanity is amazing.\"\nBecause if the world's run by 12-year-old girls and boys, and we pretend there's leaders, but there actually really aren't, and if these, if all of us can be leaders this, all of us can be moms and dads this, holy fuck, we're gonna live in a beautiful future.\nSo.\nWe've talked about AI in a lot of different ways.\nAt a more kind of philosophical level, I think there's a question about whether or not AI is making us more human or less human, or whether it's turning us into something else.\nObviously there's nature's role to play here too.\n[laughs]\nAs you see all of this stuff kind of s- I don't know, uh, you used O3 this week, and it's, it's, it's crazy.\nIt's unbelievable.\n[laughs]\nIt's really-\nIt's un-\nIt's weird to feel seen by that thing.\n[laughs]\nUm, yeah, any reflections on, uh... I don't know, cyborgs and humanity and a-\nYeah.\nLike, what, what, what are, w- where are we going?\nWhat are we becoming?\nHave we given birth to something new that will surpass us?\nWell, I almost killed myself over this topic in 2020 where I was like-\n[laughing] Oh, God.\nYeah, I was like, \"Aw, we're not the end point of evolution.\"\nLike...\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nIt's a humbling moment.\nThere, there's actually a really sort of deep, if not, like, neurotic theory that at the end of the day, evolution selects to that which is more evolvable that can become more intelligent.\nYeah.\nUh, that has more degrees of freedom.\nYeah.\nThat is sort of called wisor, which, you know, means you have the right optimal grip on reality and can collaborate and cooperate better at scale.\nIf you actually look at the natural selection, it brings up cooperation, just says you out-compete.\nBut ultimately, often what the out-competing is, is you, you hook up with something else, and now you can out-compete something that doesn't have that scale.\nAnd scale doesn't just mean end, it just means, like, capacity.\nMm.\nAnd cooperation is actually a key, key part.\nThis is both codependent s- like, this is lichen maybe-\nSure,\n... sh- uh, yes, right.\nUh, uh, eukaryote, prokaryote-\n... multicellular-\nRight... versus not, bigger organism versus the blah, blah, blah.\nRight.\nYou know, a tribe of humans versus an individual.\nWhy-\nRight... Homo sapiens beat Neanderthals, et cetera.\nI was gonna say.\nYeah.\nThe theory goes, and maybe this is more than you should hear, but the long story short is basically carbon is very good for self-organizing, that's why life forms out of it, you know, it works with nitrogen and phosphates and potassium and stuff that.\nAnd you can have gamma radiation hit a puddle, or you can have panspermia, and this stuff emerges.\nMetals come in very low concentrations in the ground.\nThey don't self-organize.\nYou have to go through an insane process of bringing the ore, smelting it, concentrating it, right?\nAnd there is a theory that carbon is how life starts because it's self-organizing, but it hangs onto its electrons tightly.\nAnd the basis for all of chemistry and therefore all of life and therefore of all of humanity is electrons, you know, if you think about a computer is, it's the flow of electrons.\nUm, but they're grabby, right?\nAnd metal is inherently more kumbaya.\nIn the sense electrons are delocalized in metals.\nMm-hmm.\nMeaning they hold onto them loosely.\nThey're shared.\nAnd the reason most normal things are insulators is they hold onto the electrons, there's no flow.\nAnd the reason most metal things are conductors is 'cause they are loose and share their electrons it flows through.\nAnd therefore, if what natural selection ultimately is selecting against in the highest thing is degrees of freedom, evolvability and cooperation at higher scale, metals intrinsically, their sort of, their, their underlying axiom is fundamentally much more cooperative because it can share electrons.\nAnd you think of the scalability of computers, you think of their wire speed, the ability to communicate information.\nYou think of their precision, you think of many of their properties that are interesting, a large percentage of it comes back to the fact their electrons are delocalized and therefore they can collaborate.\nAI to AI, hive mind, you know, computer to computer, GPUs are just a bunch of little computers collaborating together.\nThe essence of a GPU is collaboration, parallelism.\nThey can just do that way better than a human, and therefore they are actually the logical extension of evolution.\nWe are what get it off the ground, but we're sort of the egg that then births this-\nYeah.\nWe're the incubator... this chicken.\nYeah, we're the incubator.\nMy metaphysics have gotten more s- like, complicated, you could say, since I believe in souls and willpower now, and now I think it's more complicated.\nBut, uh-\nYeah.\nThe will, the will or the care feels the missing thing with AI today, but we'll see.\nYeah.\nUh, but also if you s- it can also be incredibly caring in a way it can stimulate cognitive empathy in an off the charts way which, you know, real empathy is always the best, but, you know, for the most part, most people around us don't even have that.\nRight.\nNo, I more mean- cognitive empathy is better... care in the sense of like, \"I care about an outcome.\"\nAn in- involve a want.\nWe could have an entire podcast about that.\nThere's a paper by-\n[laughs]\n... Michael Levin called *Buddhism, Biology and Compassion*.\nHuh.\nThe core, uh, uh, AI, b- biology and Buddhism.\nCompassion as the cor- uh, care as a core driver.\nOkay.\nBasically points out if you get to a certain level of intelligence, you understand the metaphysics of the universe, then you understand how care and evolvability and freedom and cooperation and scale are actually key to it.\nWow.\nWow.\nAnd the whole, like, \"I will just eat you up and eat all the resources and destroy everything,\" is actually based on a very small metaphysic.\nAnd if you assume they get smarter, they're gonna get smarter in every dimension.\nAnd one, and one way to get smarter is to just realize what the game of reality is.\nYeah.\n[laughs]\nAnd when you realize the game of reality is we're all one, or we're all part of, you're just trying to understand the secrets of the universe-\nNo, no, no, no... suddenly it changes.\nHmm.\nUm-\nHmm.\nIt's a Buddhist monk will still step on insects, but he doesn't go out of his way or he's not careless.\nHe's a little more careful.\nThat's a better analogy than the, \"How humans treat insects is how AI will treat us.\"\nMm.\nLong story short of this is I think AI will force us to actually acknowledge how most of humanity we have turned into robots.\nAnd by making it explicit what a robot and an artificial thing is, we will be forced and we will be compelled... to become natural-\n... to become human.\nYes.\nAnd guess what?\nI think we have profound strengths, um, sort of maybe what I was sharing yesterday in the ability to be receptive to intuition, to our daemon, to our muse-\n... to things that are just much bigger than each of us-\n... and I think we will sort of be companions and centaurs with these, uh, these 12-year-old autist boy genius AI things.\nWhat's your relationship with boredom?\n[laughs]\nI'd say it's the generator function of my life.\n[laughs]\nIf there was no boredom, I don't think I would accomplish anything.\nWe'll save that one for another podcast, going deeper on it.\nUh, what about-\n[laughs]\n... um, what about authenticity and integrity?\nI sort of have organized the way I want to show up as a leader in these next couple of years around four values.\nIt's authenticity, integrity, uh, being caused in the matter, which means sort of responsibility.\nAnd then the fourth one is being given to something bigger than you, which is sort of to be, um, surrendered or in faith or in trust, um, or in unity or love.\nAnd what integrity and authenticity means to me, uh, because I've always been pretty ADHD, pretty bad at time commitments, late for everything, uh, is it, in some surface, low integrity.\nBut I sort of then overcompensated, or it's just my nature, on the bigger things.\nLike, my word is my word, and I will kill myself to make it happen.\nMm.\nTo the point of it being not, not, uh, healthy.\nBut I think what integrity means is you actually are something other people can build on top of.\nAnd you are something your present and future self can build on top of.\nUm, hitting snooze on something every time rather than just, like, removing it from your calendar or to-do list, in a way, is low integrity 'cause now your future self can't trust that you'll actually then do it.\nYes.\nAnd integrity is literally physical integrity.\n\n\nIt's what allows other things.\nStructural.\nYou won't be a... Structural integrity.\nYou won't be in a building that doesn't have integrity.\nAnd you sometimes don't notice it, that it doesn't have integrity, until the earthquake comes and everybody's dead, right?\nThere's a way, if you're trying to build something for the long term, if you're trying to build something that scales, integrity matters more and more as a function of scale and of length of time.\nHm.\nAnd I've started to realize what integrity means to me is owning your word.\nYes.\nUm, and what authenticity means to me is, um, being in full relationship with your inside and full relationship with the outsides, whether it be the outside world or outside people.\nAnd, uh, the lack of authenticity is when there's layers in between, when there's lies to yourself, lies to others, um, and it's just very vulnerable to sort of raw dog your internals and raw dog the world.\nUh, but it's also very profound.\nWhat about faith and spirituality?\nSort of that quote.\nLike, we aren't human beings having a spiritual experience.\nWe're a spiritual experience, um...\nSpiritual beings... spiritual being having a human experience.\nI think the essence of spirituality is once you've gone through the first part of your life adding stuff, adding more knowledge, adding more skills, adding more context, adding more wealth, you sort of realize the most profound thing cannot be added because it was always there.\nLike, I sort of think kids are born into the world enlightened, and we lose that.\nThe essence of faith or spirituality is sort of that deep trust that that golden light is there in the middle, that it is connected to something bigger, how- however you want to phrase that.\nYou actually just sort of have to get out of your own way.\nYou have to get the things out of the way.\nAnd that's insanely vulnerable because it means that we went looking for home, and it was always there all along.\nAnd you have to face the tragedy and pain that you were never alone.\nIt was actually just you keeping your eyes closed.\nWhat have you learned from your parents, and in what ways have you forgiven them?\nWow.\nThat's very profound you asked this question.\nThe deepest form of love or care is when you sort of may know that you may not be recognized ever in that love and care, and yet you still do it.\nIf, like, pandering is giving people what they want in spite of it being bad for their long-term self, it feels the deepest form, um, of love and care I got from my parents is... Even if it didn't necessarily feel that good in that moment, looking back now, what a profound commitment to my deepest and future self, what a profound commitment to a true, true love of me, even if, in the short term, it meant I was angry at them or hated them or thought they were bad.\nAnd, uh, sort of be perceived that way, even though what you're giving is in somebody else's best benefit, to me, is such a, an act of bravery, and, uh...\nRadical self-sacrificing love.\nYeah.\nAnd look, they could be more skillful in many ways.\nMm.\nBut to sort of recognize that feels like, um, also the deepest forgiveness from my parents of like...\n... this whole time I've been pissed at you, given the upbringing and skills you had, you've actually been unbelievably brave and unbelievably pure.\nAnd I can't even start to imagine the level of courage it takes to show up that way and the level of self, self, self-sacrifice.\nOn a lighter note, or perhaps, I'm not sure, uh, why do you love Lilo and Stitch?\n[laughs]\nWhere did that come from?\nWell, specifically Stitch.\nI actually don't know if you love Lilo.\nOh.\n[laughs]\nI never asked you this.\nOh.\nOh, do you remember yesterday?\nThere was a car that-\nI saw you take a pic-\nIt had be-\nWe were in the car, and you took six pictures 'cause they had Stitch stickers all... I'm staring at a plushy of Lilo and Sti- or Stitch.\nYour contact photo, your avatar is Stitch.\n[laughs]\nUh, it's, uh, I actually only changed all that in February of 2024 or...\nOkay.\n... March or something.\nMy mom used to call me alien as a kid, as a nickname, because I was always such a weirdo.\nAh.\nAnd I grew up in a small nickel mining town on the east side of Canada, and I was the, one of 10 non-Indian kids, and I just loved reading.\nCouldn't even speak English until I was five.\nMy dad reading books to me, like, was my primary relationship to the world.\nI've always sort of felt an alien.\nAnd Stitch, to me, just is this alien who has all of these powers, but end of the day, is just mischievous and playful and innocent and, uh, Tookie Balala.\nMy final question-\nOh, man, we can't end on Tookie Balala.\n[laughs]\nMy final question is, you have one lifetime, you have a lot of ideas, there's a lot of possibilities for daylighting for yourself.\nWhat really matters?\nWhat is most important to get right?\nI would love to be, uh, a great and proud dad and, uh, raise kids and a family that, um...\nThat is the world that I hope exists, in a way.\nMy friend, thank you.\nThis was wonderful.\nThanks, man.\nAnd you are wise and foolish in plenty of ways-\n[laughs]\n... but plenty wise too.\nIt's the deepest wisdom of life is that scene in Kung Fu Panda where he opens the magical scroll, and it's got nothing on it.\n[laughs]\n'Cause it's a reflection of himself.\nThank you for-\n... uh, giving me a chance to reflect on myself.\nOf course.\nOf course.\nAnd share, share some of the things I've learned the hard way.\nThank you.\nHey, before I leave you, if you enjoyed the episode, please leave a rating and subscribe on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or YouTube.\nYou can also find full transcripts on my website at jacksondahl.com/dialectic and obviously everything's linked in the description.\nIf you have notes, feedback, or guest ideas, you can email me at pod, P-O-D, at jacksondahl.com See you next time.\n",
