  "cleanText": "Claude Code is different. It's a truly unique coding agent that is actually programmable. And this is what makes it so powerful. What makes Claude Code unique isn't just that it's an AI coding assistant, but that it's built to be fundamentally customizable at its core. This programmable architecture means Claude Code can adapt to any workflow and execute tasks in ways that are completely tailored to your specific needs. The level of programmability it offers is something you simply can't find anywhere else, not even in tools like Cursor. Because of how Claude Code is designed, people have been able to customize it in ways that are truly remarkable. To really show you how powerful Claude Code has become, let me show you some of the ways it has been implemented. The Claude Code SDK is what essentially makes it a programmable agent. This has completely changed how we view and work with AI agents. Someone had an incredible idea and actually went ahead and turned Claude Code into a fully working MCP. This is a real functional MCP and it's absolutely remarkable. I never imagined someone would build Claude Code as an MCP. Let me show you an example. If I close this and open it back up, you can see the taxi app prototype is here. Let's ask the Claude MCP to edit the taxi app file and change the main color from yellow to blue. When I send this request, you'll see it's calling Claude Code as an MCP server. It receives the prompt to change the color along with additional instructions as well. Okay, so I had been working on this for a while and it actually already changed the color when I tested it earlier. But let me show it to you as well. You can see that as I refreshed it, it changed the colors. Now let's try asking it to make some additional changes again. You'll see it's calling Claude Code. As a result, we get the prompt back from Claude Code inside Cursor. We're now working with what Claude Code returned. If you look at it now, it actually resembles a material interface instead of the neon theme we had before. I can see two main use cases here. Even though it's an unconventional idea, there have been many scenarios, especially when building UI where I've tried to implement something and Cursor simply couldn't handle it. This happens because its models are limited by their context window. The same model Claude has different context limits depending on the version. For example, Claude 3 here has a 120k token limit while Claude Code has its full context limit of around 200k tokens. That makes a significant difference. Whenever Cursor can't handle something, you can call out to Claude Code and it will solve that problem for you. And if you're saying that you can use the Claude Code IDE feature, that's okay. But Cursor won't know what it changed and the context mismatch isn't a good thing. Using this approach, Cursor maintains the context of changes claimless workflow between both tools. The second use case involves the Claude Desktop app, which I myself use frequently. I really enjoy brainstorming in it and the canvas feature is excellent. For example, when you build something like a component, you can take elements from the Claude Desktop app and ask it in the prompt to implement them. Claude Code will take whatever you've built there and implement it here. For instance, it just generated this beautiful component for me. Now, I can ask Claude MCP right here to implement it and Claude Desktop will provide full context so it can easily handle that task.

Members get priority replies to comments. So if you need feedback or have questions, that's the best way to reach us. We all know that Claude Code is the best agent out there. But what if you want to use a different model with the best agent architecture available? For example, if you want to use different models like Gemini or the new Kimi K2, which delivers Claude Code level performance at a fraction of the cost, then here's exactly what you can do. I discovered this tool called Claude Code Router and it does exactly what you think it does. This tool allows you to use multiple models from different providers. You can access Gemini, OpenAI models or even the Kimi K2 model. This is genuinely impressive. When you scroll down, you'll see the built-in providers they support: Deepseek, Gemini, and Open Router. I'll be using Open Router to access the Kimi K2 model, and this requires the Open Router API. The installation process is straightforward. First, make sure you have Claude Code installed. Then, copy the provided command, paste it into your terminal, and it will install the tool globally. Next, you'll need to modify this config.json file. You will have to create this manually in your files. Or you can use this command that I used, which creates the folder automatically. Navigate to the folder and open it in Cursor. When you first open it, the file will be empty. To fill it out, they provide an example file with all the necessary fields. When you open the example, you'll see all the different providers listed with complete configurations. Simply copy the sections you need. In my setup, I kept only the open router block and remove the other configurations. However, there are two essential blocks. You must keep the router block and the block containing your API key and host address. Here's what you need to modify. Paste your open router API key. Then add the model name. This is the Kimi K2 model name. And whatever one you use, make sure that you paste the correct full name. I got mine from open router here. In the router section as well, include the provider name followed by the full model name. Once your configuration is complete, navigate to your desired directory where you want to start this modified Claude Code and type CCR code to launch. The system will pick up your API keys and you can see this message about overridden settings. This confirms it's now using Kimi K2 as the model. You may encounter this error. This typically happens when using both pro account and API simultaneously causing conflicts. I've checked, but the system will still function with the Kimi K2 model because the first time you initialize using the CCR command, you'll see a menu asking about the custom API key. Don't click no. Select yes to proceed with your chosen key. Let me demonstrate with a simple prompt. I've asked it to create the taxi app prototype that you saw in the start of the video. As you can see, it's processing the request. You'll notice the response is slower than usual. This is typical for the Kimi K2 model, but considering the significant cost savings and the same performance level, it's an excellent trade-off. You've already seen it, but again, this is the result that it gave us. The really exciting part about this is that you now have access to the world's best coding agent with complete control over which models you use. So, this is Claude Flow, a project by someone who's contributed many amazing things over the years. As I was reading through this, I discovered it allows Claude to spawn multiple instances of itself to run a single task so that it gets completed even faster. For example, give it a task to implement a REST API and Claude Flow will divide the task across those instances and complete it as quickly as possible. It's all about having multiple agents completing tasks efficiently. Initially, I thought this wasn't really useful because a multi-agent system is also implemented in Claude Code's own system where it spawns multiple agents for separate tasks. But then I came across the Hivemind feature. And this is where it gets really interesting. To use it, you need to have Claude Flow set up first. The reason I bring this up is because for this to work properly, you have to use a command that puts it into bypass mode. That isn't ideal because you never know what Claude Flow might do in that mode. It could move outside your specified repository or even delete files on your system. So there is some level of caution required here. The author actually recommends using GitHub code spaces which is a slightly more complex topic. But coming back to Hivemind, let me give you an example of what I mean. When you want to start it up, you initialize it with this command, the initial command. If you want to initialize it with a specific project name, you can do that too, just like they've shown here. Each swarm or hive that the author describes is responsible for a specific feature of your app. So if you're building an O system, you assign that to a swarm or hive and implement it systematically. Where Hivemind really shines is in its architecture. There's a queen-led infrastructure where a queen agent gives instructions to the others and all agents operate under the same context. Memory management is handled exceptionally well. Right here you can see this full file system laid out. Everything has been managed from memory to coordination. The amazing part about this Hivemind is that since these are sessions, you get a session ID when you create one. You can resume that session ID later, which means you can keep working on that same feature without starting over. So your multi-agent system can remain preserved and you can start off from it wherever you like. One area where I felt it was lacking, especially for full project builds, is that there was no clear starting point or workflow. I could run the swarm for a single feature as I showed you. But there wasn't a proper built-in flow to guide the process. I think that's mainly because it's still in development and not fully complete yet. But once it is and once a clear workflow is implemented, I'll definitely be doing a dedicated video on this because it's genuinely something worth exploring. There's also an amazing repository called Awesome Claude Code. It's a curated list of command files, workflows, and tools for Claude Code. It has everything you need: community workflows, useful tools for Claude Code, and many resources we've featured in previous videos. You'll also find Claude Code hooks and custom commands. It's a really great resource, and I'll leave it linked below. Similar to the Claude Code customizations I showed earlier, this offers many more options to explore. It's incredibly useful. Browse through it, find what interests you, and try it out to see if it works for your workflow. You probably already know that Claude Code can be used inside Cursor and other IDEs. When you type claude, it initializes and provides you with a side panel where you can use Claude Code and it can access errors from Cursor. It functions like a chat version of Claude Code, but I've never really liked this chat menu and don't like the experience that it gives. However, I recently discovered something exceptional called Claude Code Chat. It's essentially a dedicated chat window for Claude Code. The installation process is straightforward through the extensions panel in either Cursor or VS Code. Simply open extensions, search for Claude Code Chat, and you'll find the extension you need. Once installed, you'll have access to this impressive Claude Code Chat interface. The user interface is beautifully designed and integrates seamlessly with your code editor. You can select different models, and when you enable thinking mode, you have the option to adjust the level of thinking as well. The integration fits naturally into the Cursor UI, creating a cohesive experience. All the standard features are available, including plan mode and slash commands. It's truly a complete package that enhances your development workflow. While I've demonstrated other interfaces in the past, such as web UIs that allowed Claude Code usage on mobile devices, those were quite basic and didn't support custom commands. This extension, however, offers a comprehensive solution. If you enjoy using Claude Code in Cursor, this extension provides an excellent way to enhance that experience. For VS Code users, it's a solid free option that's definitely worth trying. That brings us to the end of this video.
