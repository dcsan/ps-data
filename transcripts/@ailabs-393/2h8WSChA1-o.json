  "cleanText": "Vibe coding.\nIt's the new trend where people code without really looking at the code at all.\nThese days, almost anyone who speaks English can do it.\nBut vibe coding comes with a dangerous side effect, and that's vibe debugging.\nWhen you're building stuff using these new AI tools like cursor or claudecode, your app might seem like it's running without any issues.\nAnd I say might because in reality, that's rarely the case.\nYou often run into bugs.\nAnd that's usually because the AI doesn't fully understand what it's writing or it forgets what it already wrote due to context window limitations.\nSo now you're stuck with code that you didn't write, don't understand, and don't know how to debug.\nNow, how do you debug code you didn't write?\nThat's exactly where Sentry comes in.\nSentry can help vibe coders and professional devs debug their code efficiently, even when they didn't write it themselves.\nIt's a platform many real developers already use every day, but they've now made it even more powerful by releasing their new feature.\nSo, what exactly is Sentry?\nFor those of you who haven't used it before, Sentry is a platform that automatically tracks and reports errors in your app.\nAnd if we combine the traditional programming workflow with these new AI workflows, that's how you're actually going to build reliable software that doesn't break.\nNow, you might think you could just log these errors in a MD file or maybe run some bug bots that catch those errors, but that isn't the optimal solution.\nAnd you might think, what makes Sentry different?\nIt's actually a proper system for catching all those repeated errors in your app.\nThey've got built-in support for different frameworks like Nex.js or Python or whatever you're using.\nSentry tracks how often an error has happened, when it happened, where it came from, and keeps a full history of it, all organized in a clean dashboard.\nNow imagine this.\nIf your AI agent had access to all that context, every stack trace, every repetition, every log, solving the problem becomes way easier.\nIt could easily go ahead and fix that issue with all that extra context.\nSo, what have they released?\nIt's their new Sentry MCP server, and this thing is amazing.\nSure, it eliminates the debugging headache, but there's something even more impressive that caught me off guard.\nNormally, if you were working with Sentry in your project, what you do is go to the website, create a project there, then come back and install the SDK for the specific framework you're using.\nFor example, if you're using Nex.js or Python, you'd install their respective SDKs.\nAfter installing the SDK, you'd need to initialize Sentry in your actual code so that when your app encounters errors, Sentry can catch and log them in your dashboard.\nNow, what's the added perk of this Sentry MCP?\nLet me show you.\nYou can see that the Sentry MCP is already added in cursor.\nI'll give you details on what the tools are and how to install the actual MCP server because there's a bit of authentication involved.\nBut for now, just focus over here.\nFirst, I asked if it had access to the Sentry MCP server.\nIt replied yes.\nThen it called the tool WhoAmI to check my user details because as I mentioned, we've already authenticated with Sentry for this MCP to work.\nIt returned who I was, what my organization name was.\nThen it ran the tool called FindProjects and it identified that my organization was automata.\nAfter that I asked if it could access all of my projects.\nRemember we usually have to manually create a project in Sentry but at this point I hadn't made any project.\nSo it ran the tool called FindProjects and saw that there weren't any projects set up in my Sentry organization yet.\nAnd this is what actually surprised me.\nIt said it could create the new Sentry project for me and automatically set up the error monitoring for my application.\nNow this this is just on another level.\nYou don't have to go through the UI or do anything manually again.\nThis is how AI agents, AI based applications and these amazing MCP servers are changing everything.\nSo it said it had helped me and set up the Sentry project for me.\nIt checked if I had any teams then proceeded to create the project for my notes application and of course it knew the command to install the Sentry SDK.\nIn my case it installed the SDK for Nex.js.\nThen as expected there were configuration files.\nIt set those up as well.\nAfter that it modified my code because like I mentioned earlier you've got to update the code so that errors can be logged in the Sentry dashboard.\nAnd another thing as I already said the manual processes are completely gone after integrating the code.\nYou typically need to get your DSN from Sentry which is kind of like an API key used to send error logs to Sentry in the cloud.\nNormally you'd get this manually but here's what happened.\nSince it was handling everything, it fetched my Sentry DSN, automatically added it to my configuration, and even gave it back to me in case I needed it elsewhere.\nAgain, this is what I'm trying to tell you.\nIt handled all of that automatically.\nBasically, the MCP gives us these tools that automate the entire Sentry setup process.\nThen, it actually asked if I wanted to test whether error logging was working, and I said yes, go ahead.\nSo, in the app I used, it added three buttons that would trigger errors.\nThese are the three error buttons you see.\nActually, let me just open up the app so you can see how it added those buttons.\nSo, this is the app and these are the buttons it added to test if the Sentry connection was working.\nIf we go into my dashboard and check the issues, you can see the different ones that have come up during testing.\nSo, yeah, the issues are showing up correctly and Sentry has been properly initialized.\nNow, how do you install the MCP server?\nIt's actually quite easy.\nBefore you go on and actually install the Sentry MCP server, you need to make sure you've got a Sentry account.\nJust open it up.\nAnd if you don't have an account, like right now I do, then just go ahead and sign up.\nYou don't need to create a project or anything.\nNow, after you've signed up, you're going to get this command from the docs.\nAnd don't worry, I'll leave those docs in the description below.\nJust copy this JSON configuration.\nAnd if you scroll down, they've actually mentioned the verified clients, which means Claude desktop, Claude AI, which just means claudecode, Windsurf, Cursor, and also VS Code, and GitHub Copilot.\nSo yeah, it's verified for all of these.\nThey've listed some install instructions, but it's pretty much the same for all of them.\nJust go ahead.\nLike for example, in my case, my MCP.json is empty right now.\nSo I'm just going to copy this whole thing.\nAnd now you're going to see that the MCP server, the Sentry MCP, has been added.\nAfter you add it, it's going to run.\nAt first, it'll appear red, but once it runs the command, it'll automatically open up in your terminal like this.\nAnd you'll get this message saying the MCP CLI is requesting access.\nYou just need to approve it.\nOnce that's done, if you go back and it still hasn't turned on, just toggle it off and on.\nAnd now you'll see that the tools have been enabled.\nAnd we've got all of our tools right in front of us.\nSo, I did already show you that it can automatically initialize a project for you.\nBut what else can it do?\nThey've provided some example calls that give you a pretty good idea.\nObviously, you can ask it to list all the issues in your project.\nYou can also ask Sentry about a particular file to check if there are issues in it and then go ahead and fix them.\nThere's also Sentry's own AI powered SEIR which can analyze your issue and provide a solution.\nNow, this is part of the paid features.\nSo, that's up to you.\nBut even without SEIR, Sentry still gives you enough data about a specific issue that cursor or claudecode, whichever you're using, can automatically fix it.\nI just wanted to show you some of the tools the Sentry MCP offers.\nYou can see that many of the tools are related to using Sentry as a platform like WhoAmI, FindProjects, create DSN or create projects, which help you manage the Sentry platform through MCP like I showed you earlier.\nYou don't have to do any of it manually.\nThen there are other tools like GetIssueDetails, find errors or even begin SEIR issue fix which help you get detailed insights into the issues or actually fix them.\nIn order for you to purposely see it in action, I purposely put an error in my application.\nOne that completely broke the app and wouldn't let me use it.\nIf we go into my dashboard, you can see that the issue shows up here.\nIf I click on it, you can see that the issues listed and we get all the details about it, including the trace.\nUsing all this information, the LLM can actually understand where the error came from, track it, and get accurate insights on how to fix it.\nSo, first I just blatantly tried using SEIR to fix it.\nThat's when it told me I had to enable it and that it's a paid feature.\nThen I went ahead and told it to get the details of the issue and propose a fix for me.\nIt called the GetIssueDetails tool.\nYou can see we've got the issue ID, our organization, and then as a result, it gave us the issue summary, some context about its occurrences, and even as we scroll down, a trace, which is pretty helpful.\nIt also gave some additional context, which didn't really matter much in this case, but essentially, we gave it the issue details and as you can see, it recognized the type of error.\nIt was a type error.\nSomething was not a function.\nIt proposed that the error should be removed and also suggested an additional check to make sure it doesn't happen again.\nThen it just went ahead and started fixing the issue.\nAnd once I accepted the fix, the application started working again.\nBut how do you fully take advantage from this?\nIf you want to have this full setup with Sentry monitoring your errors and then logging them and tracing them, which will essentially help the agent debug your code better, then you need to make sure that you use it properly and use it from the start.\nSo even if you are building stuff with AI, the agent knows that you are using it and make sure that it sets it up in your project correctly and Sentry is properly utilized.\nThat brings us to the end of this video.\nIf you'd like to support the channel and help us keep making tutorials like this, you can do so by using the super thanks button below.\nAs always, thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next one.\n",
