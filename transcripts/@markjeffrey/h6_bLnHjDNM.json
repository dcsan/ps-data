Honestly, I just, you know, but in the Military there was like a no [ __ ] sort of ethos. Anyone that whined or complained was basically shunned. And you know, you then leave the Air Force into like Civy Street and everyone just [ __ ] and moans.\n\nYeah. And and so I have very little faith in Gen Zed and the other gens following on Gen Z. I hate...\n\nYeah. No, it's... Well, so a lot of people don't know you are you're a fighter pilot. Like you actually flew planes in the Military, right? Like tell us a little bit about that.\n\nYeah, I so I only spent eight years in the Military and I I obviously I joined when I straight out of school when I was 18. I um and I also started Trading when I was 18 and everyone thought I had a gambling problem because I used to blow two grand a month on the Market. Yeah. Every month for the first four to six years. Um, so it pro probably was a gambling problem because like as a junior officer back then, I remember my take-home income was about £2,200 per month. I'd pay £200 a month to the officer's mess. So that's like accommodation and food and stuff. And then the rest that oh um and then the 2,000 a month just blowing up my account. So, I've been Trading currencies for 20 odd years and uh but after sort of four years of, you know, losing about 100 grand, I finally knew what not to do. I wasn't anything special. Uh still not anything special, but I just land mines not to step on.\n\nYeah. Well, you have to you have to I mean, but what you did when you were doing that was you were learning, right? Like like the hobbit has to leave the shire, right? In order to you know, you get beat up a lot at first, right? Like like when you first start boxing, you're pretty much just getting pounded, you know, for you know, when you first start training, you're not actually a good boxer, right? But and you and you have to learn how to take a punch, right? That's part of it, right? So getting in the arena and and losing for a little while, you're actually winning because you're learning, right? And a lot of people don't a lot of people don't understand that. A lot of people are are scared to take that that first step, right? Like when I first started doing startups, a lot of my friends were just like in big companies at jobs, right? And uh they were not learning the same things I was learning, right? And I only figured this out later. And and you have a lot of moments where you're like, \"Oh my god, am I insane? Like may maybe I should have taken that big job, right? The startup shit's actually hard, right? Like it's scary. You could lose everything, right? Like for real, right?\" But yeah. Yeah. So, but you were flying planes. I want to get back to that. Were you?\n\nNo. So I started off on fix swing. Um and then the the problem is like as I was like I have an obsessive mentality. So I I have to I can only obsess about one thing at a at a time. So once I started um getting obsessed with training my Air Force career got it just went down the drain. I was to be honest I wasn't a good Military pilot in my opinion. I you know I got chopped off um off planes. I then went into helicopters for a bit. Um, and then but as as I started making more money with Trading, I just I got a slap in the face when I was 22 years old, I think, and I read the book Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiasaki. And it was like, you got to be your own Business owner, blah, blah, blah. I was, \"Oh my god.\" And I read that just as my Trading was getting better. And I cringe looking back at those days because I was 22. I was earning more than the station commander and I was driving around Basin and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. It's like all the worst things you could do like it was like so many negative eyeballs on me and I was just like a I was such a cocky [ __ ] basically.\n\nYeah. But you know when you're when you're stupid you you know you don't have that self-awareness as like you do when you're older. So yeah that's true.\n\nYeah. I mean it's just young guy just being a young guy. I mean, we were all we were all sort of there at one point, right? So, okay. So, let's talk a little about what you're doing now. So, you have a fund, DSV Fund. Why don't you tell us about that? What is that and what are you guys doing?\n\nYeah, I I guess a bit of background will probably help this. So, for the last 10 years, I've been uh buying and selling Businesses. So, small private equity type stuff using my own money. I've had I set up a um a PE firm about 10 years ago and you know I've bought all sorts you know probably bought 30 plus companies I've set up loads myself um and I've always thought that the the full Business cycle is set up run grow sell whereas most Business owners they set up run run and then make a dive you know quiet whimper and so there are very few Business owners that go through the full process And I realized that um one of my old mentors, a guy called John Davyy, uh who I respect massively. He he used to say, \"Oh, Sim, don't get too obsessed about whatever Business you're in at the moment. You just got to play the five to nine game.\" And I was like, \"What's that?\" And he was like, \"Well, you set up, run, grow, and sell a Business for five figures, and then you set up, run, grow, and sell a Business for six figures, and then seven figures and eight figures. It's just the game. Don't get emotionally connected to your Business.\" And I was like, \"Huh, that's interesting.\" Um, so all I've been doing is doing the five to nine game and and the reason being is that like most entrepreneurs or wannabe yeah entrepreneurs I guess they they you know they they watch Grant Cardone you know 10x and all that sort of stuff. They're like right I've got to go from zero Business knowledge or experience and set up the next Uber or unicorn and it's never going to happen. And you know set up a Business in in passion in your in your passion. I'm like, that is utter [ __ ] The worst thing you can do in Business is set up a Business around your passion. I've done that six times. And every time I've destroyed a passion. So, um it it's not a good thing. So, you need to set up a Business and then sell it for lots of money and then you can do your passion for fun because Business will kill your Business. Um and so the...\n\nYeah. So, go through the whole M&A process. You know, I've learned a lot and every time you sell a Business for five figures and six and seven, you learn so many new learning points each time because you're you're just at a a a more elevated table, so to speak. Yeah. And then um so I sold my Business partner and I sold a crypto PE firm last year for eight figures, which was nice. Low eight figures. Um and and then you know I've got a nice runway you know 100 plus years of runway I don't know um and so we wanted to I I wanted to take things to a different level. So I've always wanted to set up a Hedge Fund. Um but obviously it's I mean it's it's taken like 18 months jumping through all of the regulatory hoops. Now thankfully our CFO and CEO done most of the the hoop jumping. So we only got and you're in the you're in the UK. So I I would imagine it's a little bit harder in the UK to regulatory wise um than it is in the United States. I I don't know that for sure, but I think it is.\n\nIt is, but we're not based we're not regulated in the UK. So we're in Bahamas. So the premium SEC regulates us and that's pretty much the the regulatory crypto hub of the world. You know, FTX was based in Bahamas. I mean, not as a good Yeah. I mean maybe not the best example but but yeah so I understand and yes there's a lot of companies I know there's a lot of companies there for a long time a lot of people don't know this there was no other way to operate other than to doicile your crypto thing whatever it was in one of those sort of southseas countries right because because in America um the SEC was so cruel and predatory and random and arbitrary you know we're those days are in the past of Gary Gendler Uh but but there was a period that was very sort of uh prosecutorial, unreasonable, crazy. Um it was the only way to operate. So it wasn't weird for a company to be operating that way. So anyway, please continue.\n\nGendler just wanted the biggest gray space possible. He didn't define any key terms of even definitions of what a security, what is a crypto. And so because there's so much gray area, no one even dared set up a proper Business in the US for fear of getting a whales notice. So it's yeah, but thank God for you know, you know, the new Trump administrator's basically if you look at the cabinet, they're all super pro crypto. I mean, the head of the new SEC is the ex chairman of Ripple, I think, Paul Atkins. I mean, yeah. And and then you got Howard Lnik. setting up a massive sort of corporate publicly listed sort of crypto holding company like yeah so we finally got clear guidelines of what is what um so like the public don't see this but the the wheels of big money is starting to really to really spin yes that's so anyway so you have so you have this fund DSV Fund and it focuses on Bitensor only right like you're a Bitensor only Hedge Fund is that correct or is it a general crypto fund?\n\nNo. No. So technically like if you look at our documentation, we're a digital asset Hedge Fund, a crypto Hedge Fund. But um I decided or we decided that um like Bitensor is the best asmmetric trade I've ever seen in my life. And that's like 21 years of Trading. And so I was like we we got to like double down on Bit Tensor. So we are the first and only to my knowledge Hedge Fund that is 100% Bit Tensor. And so I guess the the the way I see us is that we have no coding skills. We can't code for [ __ ] I if I if I launch a Subnet, it'll probably be the worst Subnet. Um all all we can do is play I guess the money game. So we want to be a net positive teeny cog in this massive decentralized global machine. So I want like I I guess our our key role as ESB fund is to funnel in and attract as much Trading capital into Bit Tensor as possible. And so far, you know, it's a slower start than I'd like, but we're only bringing in about 700 grand a month of inflows. But that 700 grand a month of inflows that would never have touched Bit Tensor were it not for us being a big fork horn. Um and the way...\n\nWhy wouldn't these same why wouldn't these same people just go buy $TAO, you know, on Coinbase? Like why why why would they why would they buy your product as opposed to just owning $TAO?\n\nYeah, it's a valid point. Um so the the funds that we are inflowing at the moment, they're from high net worth individuals primarily. Um and uh in fact no so we're targeting fund managers and family officers and high net worth individuals but obviously we're too small and too young. So the fun of fund managers won't look at us because our aum is too small. Same with family officers to a degree. So really we've got I think 37 investors so far um and they're all high net worth individuals and they that when when we look at Trading money if you look at the demographics between of Trading it's typically Gen X and baby boomers. So these, you know, I'm a I'm big broad brush here for year, you know, 50 years old plus and and these are people that can't play with crypto, won't can't be asked, it's too fiddly, etc. And so we are simply the aperture for them to get to exposure.\n\nNow, so they basically they don't want to set up a ledger and and you know maintain their seed phrase and all that. So that's that's why they like you guys because they're used to stocks and you know traditional finance vehicles.\n\nThey're like, \"Oh, I know. I understand this.\" So that's that's the reason why.\n\nYeah. And in fact, with nearly all of the investors that we've had so far, you know, they crypto or even AI wasn't even on their radar. And so the reason why our inflows are so so small at the moment in my opinion is because we have this massive educational uh lag. So one we have to say hey look at this asmmetric opportunity over here and then we have to breach the whole you know oh it's crypto which is you know like a a contagious word people don't like that they people tend to have a negative internal immune reaction to the word crypto. Um and then and and you as you know Bit Tensor straddles three things. It straddles VC, crypto and AI. So we have to just educate these people and so when we find someone that's you know at least intellectually open-minded we we then have to educate them you know we don't force them if it just won't work. So we educate them and then you know maybe one month two months later they they obviously they do their own research because people like to discover things themselves. They don't like being forced into something. Yes. And so then months later they're like, \"Hey, um, it's time. Let's get going.\" And then we do the paperwork. So, but you know, my my goal is that eventually I want to basically suck up and neutralize all all sellside. So, I was looking at the the sell side in Mexi and Binance and on average it's about $20 million per month net of sellside. Um, obviously I can't get optics into Coinbase Prime. Um, but with Mexi and Binance, that's where most of the selling is happening really. It's 20 roughly 20 million. Obviously, when when stuff\n\n\nIt's going up and down, it's it can spike up to 50.\nSo, what I would like to do in a relatively short period of time is get $20 million per month of inflows from baby boomers and trfy and normies and institutions.\nSo, I can then just kill the sell side.\nAnd then when you look into where or who is doing that $20 million a month, it's not retail, it's validators, miners, and Subnet owners.\nBecause all of these entities, and I say this lovingly, by the way, if you're a valley sub owner or a minor, like you are the troopers and soldiers of the system, and we just want to help you.\nSo instead of, you know, mining a [ __ ] ton of alpha, you know, or or getting it as a value or Subnet owner and then having to dump it on market, you know, let us be your exit liquidity.\nWe will gobble that up.\nUm, yeah.\nSo, and and if we can gobble up $20 million worth of, you know, ecosystem sellside, then TAO itself is just going to go nuts.\nAnd then like I've done a lot of thinking and investigating in terms of when you look at all the subnets and their incentive mechanisms and and the relationships between the miners and whatnot.\nBit Tensor doesn't really get going until TAO is really around about $2 to $3,000.\nYeah.\nAnd then and then TAO really or Bit Tensor as a whole really gets going.\nSo, I just want to be that little shepherd to try and help push price up and get, you know, at least a base level of TAO of 3K.\nYeah.\nNo, I think um you know, I I've been hearing from a lot of different corners uh including just lately, you know, we had that uh Bit Tensor dinner in Los Angeles last night.\nUm which was which was great.\nAnd so I've been, you know, you know, I talked to a lot of people quite, you know, throughout the day in the Bit Tensor ecosystem and um without naming names or or being very specific about it, I hear from a lot of different people that a lot of Institutional Money is about to start avalanching into the TAO ecosystem and into subnets in general.\nIt's it's going to come very soon from a lot of different directions.\nThat is what I'm hearing.\nUm and on top of this we have the you know we have several efforts underway to provide an on-ramp for um consumers in the Solana and Ethereum and base ecosystems to on-ramp in directly into Bit Tensor and TAO because right now it's kind of hard for them to get into subnets right so so that is about to change on the sort of UI side and there's about seven or eight different efforts that are all going to launch I think in the next month or so.\nUm I'm actually getting a demo of Simply TAO who were in Paris.\nWere you at Paris, by the way?\nI don't remember whether you actually whether you went to Paris or not.\nWe have had in years.\nSo, you were there.\nOkay.\nOh, we got to talk about that in a second.\nBut, yeah.\nSo, so long story short is I think I think there's a lot of people that are that are about to a lot of things that are about to provide some new on-ramps for new money into the Bit Tensor ecosystem.\nAnd if we're only seeing only 20 million in in selling per day, that's not very much.\nThat's gonna get slimmed up real fast.\nYeah.\nOh, per month.\nPer month.\nI mean, even per month.\nIt will increase over time.\nThat that number will increase.\nBut also, so what you just said is spot on.\nAnd again, I've got firsthand knowledge of other publicly listed companies about to announce a strategic TAO reserve.\nAnd when you add up all of the the tens of hundreds of millions of dollars that of strategic TAO reserves, there's really not enough TAO to be gobbled up.\nYes.\nBy the we've got um you know, it starts off with Sello, but we then had Oblong coming out with their $7.5 million strategic TAO reserve.\nWe had James Ultra with SNPX and you know that's 10 million and then up to 100 million.\nThere's another one that's soon to be launched that's going to announce a roughly a $250 million strategic TAO uh reserve or um let's call it an STR.\nUm and then there's a few other things which I don't quite believe cuz it sounds too crazy.\nSo until I see the first TAO being purchased by these other things, I'm just going to shut my mouth.\nUm but long story short, there's not enough TAO to be gobbled up there.\nSo TA has to be has to re it has to repric.\nIt's never a case of there's not enough units of something to be bought.\nIt's always a case of units are not priced high enough for the for that demand supply curve.\nWow.\nYeah, it's coming.\nIt does feel that way to me too.\nSo um so let's talk about Paris for a second.\nSo what was So you you were inc you came back incredibly charged up it sounds like from what you saw in Paris.\nWhy don't you tell tell me a little bit about what the vibe was like there.\nIt was amazing.\nSo, I I I didn't think I could get more bullish in about Bit Tensor and then spending a week like I was there all week.\nLike I left on Friday.\nWe got there Monday, left on Friday.\nUm and I left like going, &quot;Holy [ __ ] I'm I'm still underexposed.&quot;\nAnd and that's saying something because 100% of my net worth, my personal net worth is in TAO.\n100% of all the spare cash in all of my businesses, they're in TAO.\nI mean the yield of TAO so the the TAO that my individual private companies have the yield of that pay pays payroll like I I love um yeah and I've personally borrowed money to put into TAO all of my private companies have done corporate bonds to borrow more money to put into TAO so like it doesn't do justice when I say I'm 100 in in Yeah.\nWow.\nUm, and so yeah, I I like do do you mind if I explain my sort of my mental scaffolding?\nNot at all.\nI'd love to hear your mental scaff.\nPlease go for it.\nYeah.\nSo, like I'm a I'm a big PR um first principles fan.\nUm because I think physics underwrites everything.\nAnd so if you have a goal or something, you have to go right what what are the bare physics behind it and then what's the straightest line to get to that goal?\nAnd then and so when you apply that to investing, um okay, I'm going to skip bits here, but my my my pure investment mental scaffolding is that I like networks.\nI've always been a massive fan of of networks and virgin landscapes and ecosystems.\nAnd so when you look at history, it's always been massive networks or new emerging networks that have garnered and gobbled up most of the eyeballs attention and capital.\nSo if we go back to recent times, if we go back to the 1960s to 80s, we had this brand new virgin landscape which was coding and anyone that nailed coding became billionaires.\nSteve Waznjak and you know Larry Ellison and all these people and then the next big network um was was the internet worldwide web and anyone that nailed the internet became you know the tech billionaires that you can all roll off your tongue Zuckerberg and musk and all that sort of stuff and then if you so that was the last big big global changing network.\nObviously, mobile phones as a network was pretty big over the 1990s, but if you then sort of zoom in a little bit, in 2008, the smartphone was launched by Steve Jobs.\nUm, and then one year later, 2009, the app stores were launched.\nNow, the app stores could only have existed if smartphones were there.\nSo what we what I find is that technologies always coagulate and merge or have the or lots of different techs have like this orgy of just innovation and and the app stores were huge.\nIt was like anyone around the world could build an app for smartphones and now the app store revenue is like one of the biggest revenue streams for Android and Apple.\nYeah.\nAnd then if you look at you know into the 201s you got the the crypto world.\nI mean, crypto is a massive network in itself and we've had we've seen all of the, you know, the 2013 cycle, 2017, 2021, etc.\nUm, so that was great.\nSo, that's why I love crypto.\nAnd then again, diving in a little bit into the weeds, we then have Ethereum.\nSo, late 2016, I discovered Ethereum.\nI went, &quot;Oh, oh, oh my god, this this is just insane.&quot;\nBecause they just created ERC20.\nAnd I'm like, &quot;Wow, this is like coding.\nThis is like anyone in the world could create a decentralized app.\nThis is the new virgin landscape built on top of crypto, built on top of internet, built on top of, you know, computers full stop.\nSo, I went all in on Ethereum at $9.\nAnd everyone said I was crazy.\nUm, you know, I said, &quot;Oh, we get $9, it will get to $1,000 this this cycle, easy.&quot;\nAnd then it went to like $1250 or something.\nAnd then it crashed like crypto does.\nAnd then I got went heavy in again at $100 during the the dip.\nUm, and I said this time it will go to two and a half three and it went to 4,800.\nAnd and that's because Ethereum was this virgin landscape.\nAnnoyingly, it all turned to [ __ ] because you had the ICO craze.\nEvery scammer on Earth was attracted to Ethereum and it just it was just a big bag of balls because the tech was [ __ ] It's so expensive.\nIt's clunky.\nslow.\nUm leadership within Ethereum was disastrous and you see this all the time whenever there's centralized entity of some sort.\nAnd so since Ethereum, I've sort of been sort of lost in the whole world of crypto because I've been really looking for that that next like mind-blowing moment.\nAnd I thought, well, maybe Cardano, but then that's hypeware.\nAnd then, you know, you've got the Ripple Army and all that sort of stuff.\nAnd then I I came across Bit Tensor because loads of people were proddding me.\nI looked at it and I was like, &quot;This is shit.&quot;\nYou know, you go to the official Bit Tensor website, it is crap.\nVery difficult to understand at first and it's not obvious what you're looking at.\nYeah.\nNo, I had the same reaction.\nSo, yeah, it's We were talking about that last night anyway, but go please continue.\nAnd and like I read the the website, I was oh, you know, pie in the sky, yada yada yada.\nAnd then in November 2023, I had another look at it.\nBut by that time, it was revelations came around and in October, subnets were created.\nYeah.\nAnd I was, &quot;Oh [ __ ] I'm a month late.&quot;\nAnd and when I read about the subnets, I was like, &quot;Ah, here we go.\nThis is the Ethereum moment, but for decentralized AI innovation.&quot;\nAnd then I was like, &quot;Shit.&quot;\nI mean, at that point, I was like 100% in Casper.\nAnd then I went I I just yoloed I just pivoted whole portfolio into into into Bit Tensor.\nSo I got in relatively late.\nI think it was $169.\nUm yeah.\nAnd so that was my my big year.\nAnd and and it's great that the barrier to entry within Bit Tensor is so high.\nLike you can't just spin up a subnet in your underwear at home like you can on Pump Fun.\nYeah.\nAnd and so the the the quality the caliber threshold is way higher than anything on Solana or anything like this.\nSo for me it's those massive virgin landscapes.\nSo if we had a chat again in 3 four years time I'll be very big into crisper.\nI think genomic um the gene editing landscape is also another virgin landscape.\nWe have people creating bioluminescent dogs in the garage.\nBut again, that's that's all in the future.\nBut yeah, sorry, I'll shut up now.\nI'm just vomiting all over.\nNo, no, that was that was fascinating.\nSo, thank you.\nNo, I I um I have a I have a similar way of thinking and and my career has been pretty much arriving early to new crazy things that people think are insane like the internet.\nI I I built and sold a social network from 2002 to 2004.\nsold it in the same month that Zuckerberg started Facebook.\nSo, so I was very early on that one and then, you know, early to Bitcoin.\nI was in the Ethereum ICO.\nSo, so I we think very similarly about trying to find these these new completely virgin landscapes.\nSo, I'm I'm with you on that.\nUm, that's 2015.\nThat was very early.\nYes.\nYeah.\nWell, I was doing a podcast like I do like I'm doing right now, right?\nand I inter I was just interviewing anyone who would talk to me about uh crypto stuff and I I did maybe 120 episodes of that one.\nUm most of those projects are no longer around but one of them was uh I I interviewed Vitalic about 3 weeks before the Ethereum ICO.\nSo that's how I found out about it.\nSo yeah.\nYep.\nAnd Vitalic it was you could it was he was pretty easy to get to, right?\nAnd the um you know anyway long story short that that was how I got in.\nUm so I want to ask you now about something specific because it's been sort of on a lot of people's minds.\nIt was certainly a topic of conversation last night.\nIt's, you know, being discussed right now on X and in the Discords of Bit Tensor.\nUm, is the root APY in Bit Tensor too high?\nRight now, here, so let me just set the stage for those who aren't familiar with this.\nRight.\nSo when when subnets were were born, right, uh and and alpha tokens were born, the thesis was um before subnets and alpha tokens, you would be able to stake your TAO and make uh something like uh 18% APY pretty pretty regularly, right?\nYou just got emissions just like Bitcoin miners make emissions, right?\nYou if you stake TAO, you made emissions uh from the system.\nThe idea though was that we really wanted to incentivize um we wanted to basically make the market decide who gets the emissions so that people subnetss and products that deserve them the most got the most emissions and the things that didn't deserve emissions were no longer um you know equal co-partners in the system getting emissions alongside other people who were excellent right you had people who should be getting Fs getting getting C everybody was getting C's right so now\n\n\nIt's like, okay. Now, some people are going to get A+es, but most of you are going to get C's and Fs, right? That's because that's the way the market works, right? Like, you know, 90% of things die.\n\nA lot of money was made pre-detail, like tens of millions of dollars. Yeah. So, um, so, you know, we launched this thing and it's largely, it's working to a large extent. Um, but there are some complaints that, um, it's sort of a gradual switchover. The Root APY, it's been as high as 25% after DTAL launch. Um, it is currently around, I think, 12% last time I looked, something like that. Um, so, so as a result, only 8.5% of $TAO is in subnets. The rest of it is kind of hanging out in Root earning the easy money, right? So it's sort of not motivated to, you know, why would I move out of my parents' basement, right? I'm that I'm nice and comfortable and I'm making money. Why, why not? Why would I leave, right? So, um, and then there's a number of voices that say, well, that actually has a purpose, um, and, you know, but what, what do you think about it? What, what is your gut on that? Because right now, we're all the subnets are actually down. Right now, we're all losing money in subnets, and some people point to this dynamic as one of the reasons. Why do you think about this?\n\nWeirdly, I am actually on the fence of this. Normally, I have a considered opinion on stuff. But I can equally argue on both sides, and I agree with both sides of the party. And I think where this really stems from is, I think people are attributing the cause incorrectly. So, cause of what? So, some substance is falling, as you just said. Everyone's losing an alpha, and everyone's looking for something to blame or pin the, you know, pin the tail on the donkey, and then everyone's going, \"Oh, it's because of the Root AP APR is or APY is too high.\" Now, that's the bit I disagree with, because you could move the APY down to 5%, and it won't do anything because the main reason the top 100 accounts are not in alpha is because the liquidity depth of the pools. So, um, like the alpha pools, like pools. Yeah. So, and I can see this on both sides because I got, I've got a whole bunch of wallets. I've got, you know, small wallets to big wallets, you know, um, top 100 wallets. Now, for those of you who want to come and do a $4 wrench attack on me, I, you can't come in and like, I can't give it to you. I, you just, just to make that clear here. If you come and raid my house, I couldn't give you access to that because it's all in a multi-IG, all that sort of stuff. So, let's get that out of the way first.\n\nSo, you have to put your mind or your perspective in the boots of a whale, let's say. And let's just say you got, I don't know, 30,000 $TAO. You're sat there on Root. Yes, you're making a hell of an income. Um, you know, every month, every day, but there the liquidity pools are just too shallow. Like, like the, there's really only four or five subnets that you could get some sort of fill. Obviously, shoots. You know, I was eyeing up, I was playing with, with, um, detail the other day, and I was, \"Oh, I could actually get, you know, a thousand $TAO into shoots with minimal slippage pretty damn quickly.\" Whereas typically, if there's another subnet I want to get in, I have to buy it five to 10 times a day every day for two weeks straight. Yeah. And that's why you have a lot of these.\n\nYeah. And that's why a lot of people are doing these DCA scripts. Um, and you're seeing some of the big wallets do those, you know, a lot of the F wallets are doing those, those scripts. Um, but, you know, let's take them to the limit. Let's say, you know, yield gets down to 2% or 5%. Yes, it will prod some of those bigger wallets to get into $TAO into alpha, but a lot of them, a lot of them won't move at all. So, that's one aspect of it. Now, from a whole detail perspective, I actually think it's doing what it was designed to do. You know, we're three, four months in. Um, all the trends of all of the main metrics are looking pretty good. And I think that people are just getting a little bit restless. Um, cuz it's like, we want, we want results faster. We want more to go into alpha. And, and, and I, I do get that. Now, I, I particularly like uh, David's proposition, David Fields. Yeah. David Fields at 33. He was at the dinner last night. Yes. Yeah, he's a great guy. I love David. Um, and the, you know, I like his proposal. And there was another proposal I saw where, you know, in the first month, 25% of the alpha emissions should be dumped into that. Uh, and I've seen a few other sort of spin-off proposals from David's. They're all very similar. Now, from an investor, yeah, I can get by that, you know, but for me, it doesn't really, I mean, it doesn't really affect me. I'm 80% in alpha already. Um, and I have been for over, you know, probably two months now. Um, so I'm not one of those Root s. Um, but yeah, I'm on both sides of that fence, unfortunately.\n\nYeah, I'm like, I'm uh, I'm I'm bullish subnets like you. I'm I'm like 66% in, 33% in Root. So, I'm not quite, not quite as den as you, but, but like you, I think the opportunity, I mean, I look at this and I'm like, look, you get, you get mad APY right now if you're in subnets, and we don't know when this moment is going to hit where everything's going to reverse and, you know, we, which I believe it will, because I believe that a lot of these, a lot of this big money is going to go directly into subnets. So, I don't, I think it's going to bypass, I mean, a lot of it's going to go into $TAO also, but I think a lot of it's specifically going to go in the subnets because the subnets are massively undervalued at the moment, right? So, even shoots is worth like a hundred million, right? It's not worth a billion. So, and, and it should be worth a billion, given its performance and the amount, you know, what it's doing, like it, it should easily be worth a billion. So, and I, I think that's going to correct at some point soon.\n\nCould we, could we just quickly double click on this, this whole market cap type, um, thing, because I think there's a lot, a lot of misconceptions when it comes to subnets and market caps. Do you please? So, I, obviously, a lot of the holders in Bit Tensor are crypto people, right? That, that's really 90% of our base are crypto investors. They found a Bit Tensor. It strandles crypto and AI. It was all good. And unfortunately, all of these crypto investors, they're, they've got the crypto sort of cassette tape put in their head, and they're, ah, you know, they, they look for market caps and FDVs and all that sort of stuff, which is great, but it doesn't, it doesn't work with subnets. So, I personally do not give a [ __ ] about market cap or FTV. They are the most useless metrics in my personal opinion. And I know a lot, I know a lot of people disagree with this, and you have to go back to how a subnet token is priced. So, the alpha price is the amount of $TAO in the pool divided by alpha in the pool. Okay. And, and then let's say the price, you know, let's say a bunch of people buy a subnet token, price goes up, and price needs to go up for a certain period of time to adjust the EMA, um, as in the emissions EMA. Once the emissions EMA starts kicking up, more emissions are then given to that subnet. Yeah. And that's demonstrated with more alpha going into pool every block. So, in every block, there's one, that's every 12 seconds, you have one tower going into the pool and up to two alpha going into pool. It's not always two alpha. So, it's definitely one tower, one alpha. And depending on how well that alpha, that that subnet is doing, um, it's up to two alpha going into the pool every block. Now, so the subnet is doing well, emission, you know, the EMA is going up, they're getting more emissions. Now, that acts as a sellside pressure to that subnet. And so what I worked out a few pretty soon after detail launched in, so the better you do, the more selling happens automatically, like the bigger your market cap is, right? That makes that makes the chain start selling your alpha tokens more, right? Is that correct? Yeah, pretty much. Are we allowed to share screen on this or does that? Yeah, you can. You can. Absolutely. That works. Okay. This beautiful. So, one of the metrics which a lot of people, I, I believe, don't understand is this one down here. So, as you can see, it's the amount of $TAO needed to sustain prices for 360 blocks. So, let's just focus on this big red one. This big red sort of thing. So, this is, this is shoot. Now, the way to understand this is, as you can see, it says $TAO needed is 12.879. Okay. So, let's get a calculator out, um, and use 12.879. Now, 360 blocks, that's what's called a tempo, and there are 20 tempos in each 24-hour period. So, you do 12.879 * 20. And it means in order, if we just go back to the price of shoots right now, which is, um, 216 $TAO. So, in order for shoots to maintain 216 $TAO, they have to do, they have to have 257.58 $TAO worth of buying every day just to maintain price. So, it's 350 now. So, times 350. So, that means every day shoots needs $90,000 of net buying just to sustain price. Um, and then when you times that by 30.42, which is the average month. So, at the moment, it's $2.7 million, um, every single month just to maintain flat price, water, just to, yeah, remain flat. And I did this calculation, you know, when shoots was really rocketing, and it was like 15, $16 million a month just to maintain price. So, a few months ago, I was chatting with, you know, some friends. Let's stop sharing the screen now. Um, and uh, and I was saying that, you know, when you, when you take things to the limit, and you try and calculate, okay, what, what do the emissions look like? How, how do these equations look like if the price of a subnet token was one tower? It can't, it really can't happen unless you have a stampede of people buying in all at the same time. You'll have a wick, you know, up to one tower, but it will retrace massively. And, and so for me, at least for the next two years, there's a very solid price ceiling of one $TAO. And I think there's a even, you know, almost as strong a price ceiling at half a $TAO. So, my theory a couple of months ago was that I think it's really rare that any subnet will, will trade above .5 $TAO and sustain it, and that's the key word there, sustain. And then everyone kept like prodding it with my personal network there, everyone's like prodding me when shoots went to like .35, .44, and I was like, yeah, I, I still believe, I don't think this is, you know, and I was working out all the, you know, all the sales side pressure and all that. I'm like, it's got to crash and then have. Um, and like, to put it this way, for, for a subnet to be at one $TAO, it would need like nearly all of, like over 90% of the emissions, and that's not going to happen. There's some big sub out there. So, in my opinion, PTO principles everywhere, like, yeah, I can see the number one subnet having 25% of emissions when it really gets going. But going back to, so that was the context for my answer to why market cap is [ __ ]. Yeah. Because let's just say you agree with me for the moment, and you, and let's say we agree that most, like, it's extremely rare for a subnet to trade above .5 $TAO, and then you have a smattering of subnets that'll trade between 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 $TAO, probably the top five, maybe, but then everyone else is, you know, down at the 0.1, 0.2 level. And so what this means is that $TAO prices will just oscillate, you know, between 0.05 $TAO, one $TAO, really the vast majority of them. Yeah. So, the only way a subnet market cap will go up is when the $TAO price goes up. Remember, market cap is price time circulating supply. So, if the price of $TAO stays at, let's say, $350 for the next 12 months, submit market caps will also stay flat. If not, they'll go down a little bit. That is a little bit with the emissions. So, if you have something like shoots, or maybe like, let's just say Templar cracks, um, decentralized training in a big way, right? And starts, starts inching up on challenging frontier models, right? And, and you've clearly got a subnet which should be worth billions of dollars, like, you know, it, it's, you know, if, if they actually do crack the grail, right? So, you know, let's say we, let's say it should be worth five billion. You're telling me, like, it can't get there without dragging up the price of $TAO itself? Like, there's no other, there, there's no other way for it to get there. Correct. Is that correct? Yeah. The math is simple. Like, the market cap of a subnet is price, so, which is price based in $TAO, time circulating supply. So, if the price of tower is low, it will still be worth, you know, by all. But that's where I think $TAO is the value capture, the, the overriding value capture of all the subnets, and, and $TAO will go up. It is not a matter of if, in my opinion, it's just when $TAO gets to 3K, 5K, 20K, and so it has to, like, when you see it has to, and it's a bit like, it's sort of a chicken and the egg, like when you look at Bitcoin, and then you have the hinging schedules and whatnot. Um, you know, a lot of people in the past have said, \"Oh, when Bitcoin halves, you know, it won't be profitable for the miners, and then miners will run away, yada, yada, yada.\" But what does Bitcoin do? Prices. Yes. Yeah. No, it definitely $TAO will reprice when a subnet or five of them starts kicking centralized AI's ass. Yeah, it's pretty simple.\n\n\nAnd then, when the tower product increases, the market cap of every subnet does this. And I cannot wait until we go to the AI category on Coin Gecko and the top 10 AI projects are all subnets. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, I mean, that's what it sort of feels like. I think you're right. I think this is a valid thesis, and I think, um, you know, I, I, we, we were talking last night about trying to remember what we were saying. We were talking about, um, Oh, I know. So, this is, so, one of the other guys that we were speaking with, uh, there were two people there from Arca, the, the, uh, the crypto hedge fund here, here in LA, actually, pretty close to where I live. And, um, the Arca guys, you know, Jeff Dorman and, and that, that crew, um, Jeff was not there, but some other folks from his, his crew were there. And, um, they were arguing that, um, you know, once subnet tokens are available for trading on Salana or Ethereum or base or, or on Kraken, because we, it looks like, you know, Kraken is going to at some point soon offer, uh, the per direct purchase of subnet tokens, uh, on their centralized exchange, once you can buy ches with USDC or Salana, that is going to devalue $TAO because $TAO is no longer sort of the, the reserve currency of buying subnet tokens. What do you think about that? Does that help things or does that hurt things?\nI, I don't think so. Most of these new sort of liquidity avenues that sort of poke into, into the subnets, most of them don't bypass $TAO from, from my knowledge at the moment. So, there hasn't been much real documentation around all of these new liquidity avenues. Uh, but the ones I've read so far, they're not bypassing $TAO or the, the liquidity pools. Um, I, I, I don't have a clear and cut answer for you. Just from an empirical perspective, $TAO is most likely going to be repriced as the, as more eyeballs and attention comes onto subnets.\nYeah. And, and, and with a lot of them, you can't access, you know, the capabilities as a subnet without $TAO. It is the, it's the oil, the lubricant of the ecosystem.\nYeah, agreed.\nOkay, let's talk about one of your tweets because this is, this is a pretty cool tweet. I, I, I've read it several times now, and I just want to make sure we go through it here. So, you, uh, you basically price sort of your thesis on which subnets you buy and why, and you talk about this, this range, you know, that you're, you're basically, you buy it within a specific range and expect it to go up to a specific range, and it looks like you're following this formula. You've been, you know, DSV has announced some subnets that they've invested in, right? And it feels like those announcements have tracked with this thesis. So, tell us, tell us which subnets you generally like, uh, which ones you've invested in, and, and tell us about this thesis that you posted. Yeah. So, I have to straight away say there's a big difference in thesis or, uh, the way we execute with from our OTC deals and my trading, uh, stuff. So, the OTC stuff, we, So, first of all, with the OTC stuff, as I said, like at the beginning, I just want to be a useful teeny weeny cog in this machine, and I just want to help subnet owners. In my opinion, subnet owners are the, are the true heroes in BitTensor because BitTensor dies if the subnets don't deliver. So, yeah, I want to help them out as best as I can. And a lot of them, they, they, they need to sell their alpha to pay the electricity bills, payroll, but they don't want to dump because they're worried about negative eyeballs going, &quot;Oh, some owners dumping. Let's dump.&quot; Yeah, sure. Um, so, we want to be the friendly. We're just a friendly credit card. If they're stuck with cash, use us as a friendly credit card line of credit, and we'll help you out. And they will make a big song and dance out of it so everyone knows they're sending, they're doing OTC. But, yeah, so with that OTC stuff, we park, you know, buy, park, and forget that. That goes straight to the multi-sig wallet, and then, you know, you know, um, idle fingers don't get, you know, distracted. So, so, that's the, that stuff. So, I, I don't touch it with the trading side. Um, this is really for $TAO amount maximization. So, like, if we, let's just say $TAO is going to at least $3,000 over the next 6 to 9 months. Okay, let's just say that it's that it's going there. So, that's, you know, let's just say it's a 10x. Okay. So, if all goes, you know, pretty dire or average, $TAO does a 10x, and so you, I could just sit on my ass and, you know, just, you know, buy $TAO, put on route, and accept that, you know, we'll do a 10x over the next year, let's say. But I'm a trader, and if I'm that certain that $TAO is going to do a 10x, I then have to come up with a way to, you know, how can I maximize the amount of $TAO that we own? And, and this is where subnets come in because, and this is absolutely beautiful because one, we now know, well, or in my opinion, the $TAO prices will be oscilly. You know, they're going to go up and down. They won't go above 0.5 $TAO. Most of them won't even go above 0.2 $TAO. And when you look at the summer subnets, 85% of the summer subnets is just the top 15 subnets. Yeah. Yeah. So, to go back to that post, you know, the reason why DSV's alpha wallet has done actually really well over the last two months is because I haven't [ __ ] around with the, the top 15 coins. So, when some of the subnets is crashing, that's really just the top 15 subnets which are crashing. Yeah. And, and, and also the top 10 or top 15, the, the subnets within them are constantly rotating in and out, just like the S&amp;P 500 or the footsie or whatever, you know, and loads of the top 10 have crashed more than 50%. Subnet eight, subnet one, some, like, nearly all of them have done a 50% drop. Um, whereas, you know, there's some real gems out there which have actually gone up over the last couple, couple of months. Now, so, in fact, I'm willing to lift my scope. Do, do you want me to go through our, um, our alpha pro screening process? I can share that if you want.\nAbsolutely.\nUm, I have not had, so, they don't, so, just to understand your process a little bit, because this is, this is really interesting. So, you look at the top 15%, which is 85% of the Market Cap of $TAO, and you basically say that's dangerous because it's already too big, right? So, you know, the, the bigger things, they can fall a lot more easily, right? So, um, so, let's stay away from that, and let's play sort of down, I guess, in the mid-range, where, you know, they're not schlimpmpy, nobody, uh, subnets, we, we know something about them, they've had some success, but they also haven't blown up yet. That's sort of what that's the thinking. And you, and you've done better playing in that range, middle of the pack, mid pack.\nYeah, I guess so. So, do you mind if I share my screen again? I think if I, if I draw it out, it makes way more sense.\nYeah. Um, sweet. Okay. So, let's say here is a subnet, and the start call function is kicks in. The price then goes to like nothing, and then you have crazy volatility for the first, you know, couple of weeks. The subnet then starts to bleed out for, you know, a period of time, a week, a month, it all, all depends. And then the average, and again, the key word here is average price action. Yeah. And then it forms a bit of a bottom. And then at this point here, this is, you can have a whole range of different things, but when you look at every subnet chart, it pretty, like, I would say 95% of them look like this. Yes, we are all familiar with this chart.\nExactly. So, there's me sat there thinking, right, this is a really heavy ceiling. You know, no subnet is going to be worth one tap. It's at least not over the next two years until we start having some harmonies. Uh, and then I've got this other massive ceiling in my opinion of 0.5 $TAO. So, so, where I see things is that, okay, well, you, I'm a trader. I look for the High Expected Value Bands, you know, for Trading. And I think, well, wait a minute. There is a lovely band here where a subnet has already bled out, and then it's just got, it's now starting to, it's bottomed out, and it's now starting to show signs of improvement. And it all, obviously, it, it varies, obviously, depending on each one, but that level I like to look at is at 0.005 $TAO. So, 0.005, 005 $TAO. Plus, when you look at the Emissions, the Emissions have also gotten, and it's starting to come back up. Um, and, and normally, when you see something around 0.5 $TAO, you'll see Emissions between sort of 0.15 to, um, to 0.2% in Emissions, and you start see lovely growth there. And so, I then start accumulating heavily around, you know, 0.5, and then what this means is that the price of the subnet doesn't have to moon. It just needs to get to like 0.025 $TAO. And guess what? I 5x my whole position, which means if I put 100 $TAO in that position over here, of course, it's going to take me a couple of weeks to do so, because, because there's no liquidity, but what this means is that once it has done its 5x, I've turned that 100 $TAO into 500 $TAO.\nYep. Does that make sense? It makes total sense. And then what I,\nYeah. So, then I take 75% of that out to then recycle into another subnet, and then I keep 25% in just to run, because who knows, this, you know, it's done well to get to 0.25, 25, 025, but it could go to 0.1, 2.3. Um, and then, then, yeah, so, then I can still get the upside if it is the next shoots or, you know, grains or whatever. Um, and so, that, so, this, so, really, coins between 0.5 to, let's say, 0.3 are, are really my High EV bands. And another way you can look at this is go, right, you know, shoots is 0.2 $TAO, let's say, what is the likelihood that I'll get 5x on that? Well, it's not going to happen. So, I can't, I can't, I can't trade, um, shoots. You know, if you got another big coin which is like 0.1 $TAO, what is the likelihood that that will 5x again? Very unlikely. So, if, if you're in the Business of growing the amount of $TAO in your pot, sticking around with the top 10 is not your, is not your play. The only way for buying the top 10 to make it financially make sense is if you can be truthful with yourself and you huddle for, you know, one to three years, cuz that way the APY bails you out.\nWell, let me, so, this is, I, I think this is absolutely, this dynamic is absolutely in play and true right now. This is, this is what I have observed also. Um, do you think this dynamic changes when outside money starts pouring in, and you know, like, with, with regular crypto, it's sort of like the rich got richer, right? So, the top coins got the most Investment, Bitcoin got the most Investment, right? So, do, do you know, do when the, when the Institutional Money comes in, they go, you know, uh, how about that shoots thing? It's number one. Let's just invest in that [ __ ] thing, right? Like, that's how they think, right? We've seen this movie a bunch of times. Do you think the dynamic changes with that money or not?\nHonest answer is, I don't know. I'd like to think it does change. I, I'd love nothing more than to be wrong, because if I'm wrong, it means there's way more upside. Yeah. Okay. Um, but have I stopped sharing the screen? I just want to double check. You did. You did. Yeah, we're all good. Um, I, I would love to be wrong. Um, so, that, yeah, but for, for me, that's why DSV has done really well over the last two months, even though some of subnets have crashed, is because, you know, we love getting in into those High EV bands. Um, yeah, it's a great, it's a great Trading feature. I love it. Michael White liked it as well. We had a whole chat about it. So, yeah. Yeah. And it just means that if I'm like, like being pessimistic, I reckon I can fi at least 5x the amount of $TAO that I have over the next year whilst $TAO itself does a 10x, let's say, and I've done the maths, you know, I, I could conservatively do a 20x, even though $TAO has done like a 10x, if that makes sense. Yeah. No, it does. It makes total sense.\nthe alpha size side as in the active part of the Hedge Fund comes in. But, um, I think one thing that may be helpful to a lot of, I guess, newer Investors is if I share my, my OTC subnet selection process. Sure. That, yeah, and this may be the last thing we, we talk about because we're coming up on the hour here, but, but, but please do, sorry, and tell us a little bit about the subnets. I don't know. Let's, you've, you've announced some subnets that you've invested in. Let's talk, tell me which, which subnets those are as well as part of this. Yeah, we tested, um, in one, two, 13, um, 33, 44, 50. Oh, and 25. So, three Macrocosmos, and then, you know, um, and then Omron, Ready AI synth. Um, yeah, I'm in Omron, too. It's sort of an oddball one, but I think that, I think that one's got, that one could be a very big one, I think.\nYeah. Okay. You think what I think. Colin is awesome. Colin needs more eyeballs on, um, as con, as Jake says, it's SSL for AI. Um, yeah, and, yeah, it's needed. It is needed. So, yeah, I love all of them. Um, like, you know, there, I don't think there's a stronger team in, in BitTensor than Macrocosmos. Um, yeah, equally as strong, I guess, is score that. So, the, so, the reason, yeah, the reason I love detail is originally BitTensor was stranding AI and crypto, but now detail is now also strandling the VC world and, and or the PE world. So, now, every single subnet is like a brand new AI startup, or that's what they are. So, then people like me can go, huh, sweet, I can, I know how to evaluate these because I've done it for the last 10 years. So, I start with the people. Do I like the people? Do they have a good seuite? Um, and like, what are\n\n\nI've had a lot of chats with different subnet owners, and there is a stark difference.\nSo yeah, for example, let's take Score.\nFreaking love Score.\nAnd one of the reasons Score, in my opinion, is so freaking strong is because, yes, it's doing something cool techwise, but the suite impresses me more than anything.\nSo if you look at the part, the pedigree and the background of Max, you'd invest in Max on his own.\nYou'd invest in Idol, you know, if he went off, you'd invest in Justin.\nI mean, I didn't fully understand Justin until I spent some time with him last week in Paris.\nJustin has a hell of a background.\nAnd then you got Peter, their chief AI architect, and like he's a polygot.\nUm, so this is the strongest suite I can see so far.\nAnd yeah, and it and they will they are obsessed with revenue.\nAnd I think subnets that deliver revenue and convert a chunk of that revenue into, you know, alpha purchases will be that lovely, lovely flywheel.\nSo, um, yeah, you know, where some owners, and I'm not saying this in a derogatory sense, they're really amazing technicians, you know, the great building tech, but they've never set up a business before.\nThey've never gone and got enterprise contracts and and got big seven, eight figure revenue streams in, whereas Score has done that, and you know, I have zero quams that, you know, Macrocosmos will do that as well.\nSo yeah.\nYeah, the Macrocosmos guys are great.\nI've had them on a couple times.\nSo yeah, big, big fans.\nJust saw them in Austin like a month ago at Endgame.\nSo yeah.\nOkay.\nWell, we're uh, we're a little bit over the hour here.\nUh, before we go, uh, anything you want to plug, websites, Twitter handles, this is the time.\nNo.\nUm, just if you know anyone that wants to get into Bit Tensor but doesn't want to play around and do all Finley stuff themselves and they're a high net worth investor, just ping them over to DSV, and we will gladly look after them and treat them like royalty.\nUm, and also we're we're we're launching Revenue Search.\nUm, Friday is our first episode.\nSo like novelty search and Hash Rate and and the the Bit Tent Guru podcast are beautiful for the long form deep deep dives, but I think Revenue Search, we're going to cap them at 15 minutes, and I just want as many of them as possible, and the sole focus of Revenue Search podcast is like, right, you have a new revenue announcement, share it.\nYeah, and and and I think this is this will help normies and non-coiners understand subnets better.\nYeah.\nNo, we definitely need that.\nI mean, I I try to keep I try to keep it dumbed down, but like we just it just it becomes insider baseball on this show for whatever reason, despite my best efforts.\nSo, there it is what it is.\nAll right, everybody.\nMy name's Mark Jeffrey.\nThis has been Hash.\n",
