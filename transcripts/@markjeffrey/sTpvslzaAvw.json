  "cleanText": "Hello everybody and welcome to Hash Rate. My guest today is jon_durbin of CHUTES subnet 64, which is currently the number one subnet in the Bittensor ecosystem. Hello jon_durbin.\n Hey, how are you?\nI'm doing great. So, uh, congratulations on all your success. We see Chutes all the way at the top of the charts. Uh, like the dark side of the moon was in the 70s and 80s was like perpetually on the charts. So you guys are sort of like the dark side of the moon of uh of the Bittensor world. So uh congratulations on that. Um, why don't we, yeah, why don't we just start off uh for people who don't know, there's a lot of people watch this show who are just sort of Bittensor curious. So they they sort of they've heard of Bittensor or they see the TAO coin, um, but they don't really know like all the ins and outs of all the things going on in the subnets. So why don't you just tell us really briefly what Chutes is?\nYeah. So, Chutes is a uh what they call a serverless compute platform, which is a horrible misnomer basically because it's always powered by servers. But um what we do is we sort of abstract that complexity away from you. So um you know, let's just walk through a quick experiment. You want to make an app, you need you know at least one server, right? And say it goes super popular overnight. Well now you're going to need you know n servers and you're going to need to build a load balancer. You're going to need to build scaling mechanisms. You're going to need to install the drivers on each of them. Like all this stuff. So you're going to have to do a lot of infrastructure setup. With Chutes, what we've done is we've said you just bring your code and we will handle all of the rest. So we handle scaling, we build the Docker containers, you know, we handle the drivers, we handle scaling as you use it more or less, we'll scale up or down. Uh, we handle user management, payments, everything. So it just simplifies the the entire AI deployment stack and it is specifically for AI models, right? So I couldn't just sort of run my website on Chutes. It's not meant for that, different different use case, right?\nYes. Although I don't see any reason we couldn't do that like a CPUon version of of Chutes in addition to what we do now. I mean, I think that would be actually super helpful because um I mean it would be great for us for example if we could decentralize our app across Chutes, that would be awesome. So yeah, I I think we will see something like that soon.\nInteresting. So, it's sort of Squarespace like, right? Like, and I've been I've been a CTO before long time ago, not not recently, but um but yeah, no, all this all the steps you describe are actually quite painful and just and suck up a lot of time and distract you from the main mission of making a great app. It's just all this sort of infrastructure. You know, it's like 90% of your time is spent on like that, right? Scaling and routers. And if you can just get rid of that and just have have like a Squarespace thing where you're like click click click click, boom, up and running. That's awesome.\nSo, if if I don't use Chutes, what what is sort of the alternative? I guess I go to AWS and I have to um what is sort of the alternative to using Chutes? Is it AWS or are there other sort of options as well?\n Well, it really depends on what you're trying to do. Um so, you know, AWS may be one option. Google. Obviously, any of the hyperscalers are going to be an option, but that's going to be mainly um renting raw servers and you know, again, you'd have to set them all up and everything else.\n Um if your use case is purely doing inference from LLMs, you could do, you know, chat GPT or Claude or any of those. And then of course, um you know, more direct sort of related products would be something like replicate or uh modal. Um, so they both have kind of similar features where it's um sort of arbitrary apps that you can deploy and then you can select the GPU types and and things of that sort and then um they'll scale up. So yeah. So um okay, let's talk a little bit about the metrics of your success. So I I I have some numbers here but I think they're old. I think they're from May. So I have a user count. So number of users who have used your product around 200,000. Um, is that still accurate or is that higher? I assume that's probably a little bit higher now.\n Yeah. So, um, anyone can actually see all of our metrics, uh, directly on the site. So, if you go to chutes_ai.appressearch, um, our user count today is actually 371,000.\n[Music]\nWow.\n So, yeah, little bit of growth there.\n Yeah. Nice. And the number that the total number of tokens uh was was around two trillion. I think you I saw the I saw the I saw go buy an X that you guys had passed the two trillion tokens served mark. It's pretty amazing. So is that still\n Yeah. Yeah. So um now we're at seven about 7.3 trillion.\n Oh my god.\nOkay. So quite a bit higher. Nice. Nicely done. Um and then uh and and so the other sort of stat I read was uh this was a tweet from you guys. I think yesterday we hit a 100 billion tokens processed per day. And for context, uh this is a third of what Google was processing just one year ago. So that I mean that's a that is amazing, right? So um so with all this so I'm trying to figure out like uh how to contextualize these numbers in terms of the broader AI landscape like what percentage of AI serving are you doing? Do you have a sense of that? Is it like 5%, you know, just in in the entire world of like all the AI that's being served up? Do you know?\n Well, so that's a great question because there are so many different ways to actually access these AI models, right? You can do um you know direct through some of these frontier labs and they often don't actually publish their numbers. Um so we have no idea for example the number of direct API calls that Claude would be doing. Um now we have proxies for that. So, for example, you can go to Open Router and actually um if you go to Open Router's homepage and then click on the rankings tab at the upper right, you can see um sort of all of the models by usage and you can do you know by week or by day or whatever. So if you look um unsurprisingly you'll have um you know Google with their Gemini models sort of at the top along with anthropic but then if you look at number five and number six you'll see um deepseek v30324 and deepseek v30 0324 free. So, um, if you look at the free one, that is, um, Chutes and Targon doing those, but it's insane to look at because we're at the the fifth mostus model. Um, and that's the free version. So, so actually, if you included uh the free and the non-free, um, I think that would actually put it closer to number three.\n Um, wow.\nBut you know and so that's behind anthropic uh you know sonnet 4 and Gemini 2.0 no flash. Um, so I, you know, as a percentage, I don't know. All I know is that, um, there's a huge use case for these open way models. Um, and you know, we're serving the vast majority of the tokens on, uh, the DeepC 30324 free. Um, and actually it the re, you know, we get asked this question a lot. I'm sure you may want to ask as well, but, um, we sort of get a lot of push back for doing, you know, these free models. Um, but you know, one of the core issues I guess with with Bittensor or any cryptoreated AI project is that there's sort of this like giant chasm between the AI world and the crypto world. And a lot of AI people just do not want to have anything to do with crypto whatsoever.\n Yeah. And so um you know the most important mission we can solve um is basically chipping away at that barrier and and getting more people to sort of understand the reason why we want something like Bittensor. And it really I mean it has I don't want to say nothing to do with crypto but really like crypto is what enables the decentralized permissionless mechanism. Like that's the whole reason it all exists.\n Yeah. And you know it's it's hugely important to have these sort of you know competitive models available to anyone and they're locked to a particular set of model weights so you know you're not going to have some random change in the API response quality at some point new filters added you know whatever.\n Yeah. So I did notice when DeepS first came out you guys had it up I think like before anybody else like you got it up super fast. I did notice that. So, uh, you know, if if you're looking for the new stuff, you guys are just on it. And that's that's like, you know, that's that's huge. That's huge value right there. Um, so you you were mentioning the the crypto versus AI thing. So, the the value proposition of Chutes is you can run these models for free or I think at a steep discount also because I do know that you have payments and I know you recently added fiat payments. Um, and I think before that you were accepting PE payments in TAO. Um, the TAO token, right? So that was how people paid you. Um, but the cost was something like 16th of what it would cost you if you hosted these models on AWS yourself.\n Um, plus, you know, everything's already pre-assembled for you. So it's just, you know, why wouldn't you want something that costs, you know, one sixth that is like, you know, a tenth of the work, right? It's it's it's a pretty awesome deal. Comma. However, it is subsidized. You know, the reason why you can offer things for free or at a very low price is because you are getting emissions from the Bittensor TAO chain. You're getting you're basically getting emissions in this coin. Kind of like the way Bitcoin miners work where they get bitcoins for mining Bitcoin, the chain um which you are then selling to pay for costs. Is this all correct?\nYep. That's exactly right. Yep. So um which is not to say that we won't offset that with revenue but it's again it's one of those things where um if we immediately started charging no one would have made that transition from the AI web 2 space into bit tensor power inference right and I think um so you know the discounts and things like this these are these are all ways to sort of build trust and you know build up the product and and show people why something like a decentralized platform form actually makes a lot of sense. Um so yes, we are definitely 100% subsidized by Bittensor emissions. um we are enabling fiat and even even something like fiat it really has um it's not quite as simple as just oh put a credit card on there because things like OFAC compliance and all of these other things and if you're trying to build a truly decentralized platform you want to make sure you can actually accept payments from people that are in embargoed countries right so um it it's not quite so simple as just enabling payments um there's there's regulatory things and compliance to deal with and all of that kind of stuff. But we are finally at a point where not only do we have the TAO payments which get automatically staked to the token.\n Um we wanted to do that instead of um you know as a company keeping that as revenue or anything else because by staking we're basically increasing the value of Chutes for all token holders which makes the most sense to us. Um, yeah. So, so just be clear when the TAO comes in. So TAO I pay you in TAO. You take my TAO that I just paid you with and you buy Chutes tokens, right? Technically you stake TAO which get you gives you Chutes tokens. So that's what you just said.\nOkay.\n Yep. And so when we originally made this design, I think it was maybe a couple weeks after dTAO was launched, I think we were the first or you know one of the first subnets, I think the first to um to start actually staking our revenue into the alpha token.\nAnd um at that point, as far as I know, the burn mechanism was not in place yet for burning alpha tokens. Um so I think there's an argument to be made there where um instead of staking the tokens, we should just burn them to permanently eliminate them from the supply. Um, so you know, that's probably something we'll do at some point, which is fundamentally kind of the same thing because either way we're sort of locking up, you know, either staking or burning. Um, but yeah, they're they're they're all locked up. And then same thing with fiat. So with fiat, it's kind of a a bit of a manual process right now. Um hopefully with some of these DeFi mechanisms that are coming on board it won't be uh manual but right now it's basically we take the dollars convert them into TAO stake to the alpha and then that will also be public. So like all of our payments everything is is part of our API right now. So you can actually track that.\n Okay. You said two things which seem to be at odds and I'm sure there's an explanation but I don't I don't know what it is. So, you said that you're you're basically subsidized by your emissions um but you're taking the payments and translating it into um your subnet tokens, but you're sell you're also selling your subnet tokens. I guess they're not at all. You're just you're selling your subnet tokens, correct? To pay for things like what's it like? Explain that to me.\n Yeah, so the the miners will sell the alpha token to pay for their server bills. I mean unquestionably that's just the how things work in in Bittensor and then same thing with the validators. So the validators it's a bit um it's a bit of an interesting topic because that 41% of the Yeah. So if you don't know there's a there's a 41 split to miners, 41 to validators, and then 18% to subnet owners. um the 41% that goes to the validators really the validators only get like nine or 18% of that because they have a a take the rest of it actually just goes to the the token holders who are staking.\n Yes. So most of the validator\n\n\nToken holders who have staked with a particular validator, they get the bulk, and the validators get 9 to 18%, kind of depending on how they set the, is whatever they offer, right?\n\nSo yeah, if you, you have to be careful which validator you stake with because you're going to get a different deal from each one.\nSo anyway, please continue.\nYeah.\nSo, so the selling is going to come from all three of those pools, right?\nIt's going to come from the miners who have to pay for their hardware.\nIt's going to come from the validators uh to pay for their hardware.\nGranted, on Chutes, it's actually really, really cheap to run a validator besides the main one, um, because they use like a lightweight auditing system to replicate the weights.\nUm, and then the subnet, you know, like we have bills, we have employees, we have expenses to run, and we run the main primary validator.\nY, um, so yeah, I mean it is at odds to an extent.\nUm, but I think it sets the precedent.\nSo at some point the revenue will far exceed the amount that we would need to cover the expenses, right?\nAnd so at that point, if the system is already in place where all revenue is staked regardless, then um, even though like we could set aside some from the revenue and then just keep that, but it's, it's a much cleaner, easier thing to understand that revenue goes to the alpha token.\nWe do sell some of the alpha token to fund operations.\nThat's just how it works.\nUm, yep.\nJust, just how it is.\nSo where do you think, actually, let me ask you a different question.\nSo if I am a miner in the Chutes universe, I am basically supplying GPU to you, right, to serve up uh all these models and the inference.\nIn what respect do I supply GPU?\nDo I supply a machine with a specific model loaded on it, or do I just sort of, you know, supply my GPU, which you then take and put into kind of a grid, like a, you know, an abstracted compute grid, and you manage all, all the stuff on top of it?\nLike how does that work exactly?\nYeah.\nSo, um, really it comes down to the incentive mechanism that we provide.\nUm, so on Chutes, we have four categories of scoring for our incentive mechanism.\nY, first is compute units, uh, which is basically the number of seconds your computer, your GPU was used.\nUm, second is the number of actual requests that you serve, regardless of the amount of compute that they used, but just the sheer number of requests.\nUm, and then there's a bounty mechanism.\nSo bounties are for what we call cold starts, meaning you either deploy a brand new model or there's a model that isn't being used, so it gets, you know, spun down to zero nodes, um, and someone requests that, well, we want the user experience to be that that model gets loaded very quickly.\nSo we have a bounty score to initialize, you know, to incentivize the miners to get that, um, that model running quickly.\nUm, and then we have what we call a unique shoot score, which is basically the breadth of models that every miner is running.\nUm, so that, you know, we want most of the models to stay hot, so they're always available to users as they need them.\nSo ideally, we kind of avoid the bounty mechanism entirely because the model is already ready to go.\nSo, um, so that said, we at, you know, Chutes, we don't control what miners deploy at all.\nUm, that's sort of like the intelligence behind chute mining is you as a miner are trying to optimize for those four categories.\nSo you know, maybe you just have a lot of raw compute that you want to throw at the most used models.\nMaybe you have, you know, really fast startup because you're, you have all of the model weights on RAM discs with really fast network, and you can load them quickly for bounties, you know, whatever the case may be.\nAnd so by just defining that incentive mechanism, the miners will basically perfectly scale any of the models to whatever the inventory is at the time.\nUm, and you know, people give us a hard time sometimes for saying we don't really have like intelligence on Chutes, but really, I mean, if you think about the complexities of DevOps and scaling, and you know, if you were to try, for example, to define an autoscaling metric for a model, what would it be?\nIt can't just be GPU utilization because whether you have one request in flight or 100, the usage will still be 100% because it's going to use up all of the cores to do those matrix multiplications.\nSo you can't really look at that.\nYou can't really look at just the number of requests because maybe there's a lot of input processing versus output.\nAnd you know, so to try to like manually define all of these, um, these parameters to scale yourself is actually kind of tricky to do.\nWhereas you know, that's what we have farmed out to the miners.\nThey control scaling the apps and cold starts and everything else.\nGot it.\nOkay, that makes sense.\nSo yeah, so it's basically, so it's not abstracted compute.\nIt is very specific machines where or it's model oriented.\nBut I guess you decide, you, you as the miner decide like how many machines you want to dedicate to a model, but what you were serving up, it's model centric, that is the atomic unit of the Chutes universe, and I have to, I have to basically slot into, um, that definition in order to earn emissions.\nSo okay, now that makes a lot, it makes a lot more sense to me now.\nOkay.\nUm, so in where does, where are you going with this?\nWhere do you, where do you think this business, the business of Chutes looks like at maturity?\nLet's say, I don't know, two years from now.\nUh, is it generating, is it profitable?\nIs it generating revenue profitably?\nUm, what, and and what, what is, what is the ultimate success look like for you guys?\nYeah.\nSo I think it's important to, um, maybe just go back to sort of what is the goal and what is Bittensor trying to achieve and all of this stuff.\nAnd so, um, you know, one of the things that actually got me into this sort of LLM universe is that, um, models from these frontier labs would would randomly decide to censor responses from, so I was working at an eiscocovery company, uh, sort of doing like legal Q&amp;A of documents, right?\nAnd and um, some of these models would just refuse flat out to answer, even though I've given them the documents and I've said, you give me the names, addresses, and times from from this document or whatever the case may be.\nAnd it would respond like, &quot;No, this is censored because it looks like you're trying to dox someone or you know, something like that.&quot;\nYeah.\nAnd so if you think about Chutes, um, you know, we're trying to be sort of a permissionless and open-weight, open-source platform so that if you're a builder, you know that this is the model, this is exactly the response you're going to get.\nWe're not going to add in some sort of new system prompt.\nYou can go see the source code.\nUm, you can deploy your own version of the model if you want to.\nIf you want to use a different inference engine, you can deploy an uncensored model if you need, you know, whatever the use case is.\nUm, and there's never going to be sort of like with uh OpenAI or any of these other companies, maybe they prevent people in the EU from using their model because of regulatory compliance.\nMaybe we sanction, you know, Russia.\nMaybe China takes the lead and they have their frontier lab and they block the US.\nUm, you know, so there's all these situations where we really need sort of permissionless above anything, but also decentralized.\nAnd so, um, and and to accomplish that, um, you know, one of the reasons we started Chutes was that we had compute subnets, but we didn't have ones that were sort of stateless that would survive minor dregistrations and things of that sort.\nAnd so we wanted to build a purely stateless compute substrate that would do all of the, you know, failover and scaling and all of that kind of stuff.\nSo for us, I mean, success is really, um, being sort of that universal compute substrate for for anything that you want to do, um, related to AI or you know, potentially not related if we do like CPUon website hosting.\nUm, and so, you know, getting more adoption.\nUm, and again, it's also about bringing the people on board that are currently sort of anti-Crypto.\nAnd so, yes, you know, revenue will come.\nWe're actually, I think either today or by the end of the week, um, flipping off free models entirely, but it'll still have a free tier.\nSo, it, you know, we can discuss that.\nAnd I, I don't know if the numbers are, um, completely decided yet, but basically it'll be kind of like Google Gemini where you have a free tier and then beyond that it's it's PGO.\nWe might have subscription plans and things of that sort.\nSo, um, in terms of revenue, yeah, I mean we're, we're, we're switching that into gear right now.\nUm, and profitability is one of those interesting questions because I guess it depends on what your definition is.\nIf by profit,\nGo ahead.\nI was going to say if by profitability you mean that what we have to sell is less than what we bring in.\nUm, that's one question.\nIf by that you mean the sum of all emissions for the subnet across owner, validator and minor, whether they get sold or not, um, that is a sort of a different question.\nUm, because again, you know, the 41% to validators, that's all staking mostly, and you know, a lot of that just gets held for the APY.\nAnd then the 18% to owners.\nI mean, my, my share is completely locked up, going to be locked up in a smart contract where it will just be inaccessible.\nHeard about that.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, so I think, I think the biggest thing for us to achieve is to actually just offset all of the minor costs more than anything else.\nAnd then we can start tackling the validator and the um, the owner emissions.\nBut um, profitability by my reasonable standard to start with would be offsetting all minor emissions with revenue.\nAnd then um, in theory, we could actually just start paying the miners in stable coins or something if we wanted to instead of TAO.\nI don't want to do that.\nI mean, I don't think that really makes sense.\nIt's the whole mechanism is already built in.\nUm, but yeah, I think, um, I think we, we do still have sort of one barrier though, uh, as a BitTensor ecosystem to get into sort of like the mass revenue cycle, and and that is, um, you know, it's like a a blessing and a curse is we have no idea who the minor is on the other end of that UID.\nUm, and so you know, we have a ton of verification and validation mechanisms in place to ensure the miners are always doing the right thing.\nUm, but there the, the limitation is really the privacy concern.\nUm, and so we need a way to prove that your prompts will never get out, right?\nIf we want to onboard businesses, we need to make sure your data and your code is always completely confidential.\nAnd so, um, and that's just not, that's not a Chutes problem.\nThat's AI White.\nI mean, I, I have some friends that are screenwriters, and I, I know one that has written a romcom with a very, very unique sort of premise to it.\nAnd she wanted to upload it to an AI uh to have it analyze sort of where the breaks were in act one, act two, act three.\nAnd and another screenwriter friend said, &quot;Don't do it because once you do that, the AI now knows your plot.\nIt's now training data and it may and your really unique premise may be spit out in an answer to somebody else.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nSo, it's pretty dangerous for IP.\nYeah.\nGo ahead.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, um, that's one of the things that we're, we're, um, working on and trying to get out as soon as humanly possible is, um, having TE for the miners, which is, it, it means trusted execution environments.\nAnd um, so like Targon has this, for example, um, with their TVM.\nAnd um, so TE is great in that anything inside that VM is going to be encrypted, and it's going to be guaranteed, um, you can actually check, like with cryptographic signatures, that it's in a secure environment.\nUm, but there's still a bunch of attacks you can do on TE, like you can actually just use uh file system mounts and stuff to inject random binaries.\nYou can open back doors, you can, you can do side channel attacks, you can corrupt the memory.\nUm, so it, it's not quite so simple as just enabling TE, but that said, we're, we're getting very close.\nWe have it working in in dev.\nAnd what that will do is it will actually allow us to prove, um, not only that all of your data is always encrypted, um, but that the code that's running, we can actually do like as part of the initialization process of the machine, you can have it be part of that uh TVX signature.\nI know I'm probably speaking Greek a little bit, but, yeah, I just, I, you only lost me when you said TV.\nI understood everything up until t.\nWhat does TVX stand for?\nI don't know what that, t, Yeah, TDX is, uh, Intel's version of TE.\nIt's just their technology.\nGot it.\nY, okay.\nAnd so, um, anyways, a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo, but what it will guarantee is that the software is exactly what we say it is, and you can go download our source code and you can compare it to the actual image.\nYou can inspect the files.\nYou can compare check sums and u from that you will also see that we have all logging disabled, no one is ever going to see your prompts, even if you have like direct physical access to the machine, you can't pull out the the RAM and copy anything from it, and the prompts never go anywhere, and I think that's, um, you know, BitTensor or sort of in general, I think the philosophy is always don't trust, verify, um, and so in this scenario.\nThat's exactly what we're trying to do.\nYou don't have to trust us that your data is private.\nYou can actually just go check the report, compare the source code, and know for for certain, um, that it's never going to be leaked.\nLike you, you can trust the system with your proprietary data.\nYeah, that's pretty awesome.\nI mean, I, I do that is one of the things I love about BitTensor is that it is, you know, what Open AI, it is what Open AI should have been, right?\nLike we should have this sort of ethos of, you know, the information is private and you know, your prompts are private, um, you know, for sure what models you're running and you know, whe whether it's it's decapped in some way or not, right?\nYou, you know exactly what you're getting, uh, and every and that is the world we want to live in, and I, I, I firmly believe in that, you know, that religion, um, that has always served us well in the past, you know, when the internet was was newly born.\nThere were all kinds of, um, you know, debates over whether encryption should be allowed, whether uh free speech\n\n\nShould be allowed, right?\nThankfully, we got the right answers on those, but we're now sort of facing those same questions again with AI.\nUm, and we're seeing the same bad actors sort of raise their hands and try to get their grubby little mits on it and corrupt it.\nSo we have to make sure that this vision in somebody with this vision, hope hopefully Bittensor, but you know, may, but in general, everybody, uh, this vision is the one that wins.\nSo I, I'm, I'm definitely very on board with that.\nHowever, in order for that to win, just like the internet needed this to win, you need commercial successes, right?\nYou need, you do need the speculation.\nIt's, it's part, you know, if it's, if we're doing capitalism, then you got to have capitalism in all of its, you know, the ugly as well as the, and you know, the, the ugly is also good in some ways, right?\nSo the speculation powers the innovation, and so you know, what, what I'm really trying to get at, I guess, with the profitability question is, what is, and I'm still trying to figure this out.\nI don't know what the answer to this is.\nWe haven't really had a breakout subnet yet that goes to a billion dollars in valuation or maybe beyond, right?\nMaybe $10 billion in valuation and is somehow, you know, really sustainable in terms of revenue and usage and all that stuff.\nThe closest example we have is you guys, right?\nYou guys have have gotten the furthest towards achieving fusion, but I don't think anybody has really achieved fusion totally yet.\nAnd, and I'm trying to figure out like, what does that look like?\nHow does it happen?\nIs it, does the subnet have to buy back its own tokens?\nUh, is it okay for the subnet to not be profitable at all?\nThat just sort of, you know, and there's an argument for that because that is indeed how Bitcoin miners work, right?\nYou know, Bitcoin miners don't have another business.\nThey mine Bitcoin and then they sell it.\nThey, they sell emissions, right?\nSo, you know, maybe that's okay, right?\nLike, I, I don't know.\nAnd I've talked, there are definitely a lot of different opinions on this.\nSo, when I ask the question like, where are you guys going?\nI'm really asking the question, what does a successful subnet look like?\nWhat are the characteristics of it?\nUm, may, maybe the subnet token has to have utility, like you demand payment in your token only, which that maybe that's bad, maybe that's good, I don't know, but that's, that, that is an option, right?\nSo, in your opinion, and I don't know if you formed an opinion on this, what, what is down the road when we see the first breakout subnet, what do you think the characteristics of that are?\nDoes it have to be profitable or does it not?\nYeah, I mean, that's a good question.\nI don't know that, um, well, I guess does it have to be or maybe the other question is, should it be?\nUm, so you know, exactly like you said, Bitcoin, there is no revenue there.\nIt's purely speculation, really.\nI mean, there are apps built on top and everything else, but really it's, I mean, the minor, it's, it's only cost, like, you don't generate a product by mining Bitcoin.\nAnd so, and I think, uh, what do we spend on on mining Bitcoin per year just for power and equipment and stuff like that?\nIt's what, 12 billion or something.\nIt's insane.\nI don't know.\nI don't know the actual numbers, but yeah, it's.\nYeah.\nSo, so it's a lot of money and it's purely speculation, really.\nAnd I mean, there's, there's other sort of second level, um, markets that that unlocks, but at the same time, you know, so if we think about AI versus something like Bitcoin, you, you can't go use the commodity that Bitcoin provides.\nI mean, you can use, there isn't one, there isn't one.\nAll that compute is, I mean, it maintains the ledger, which is incredibly important, don't get me wrong.\nI mean, it's very, very much important, but it's also one of those things where, you know, if we were to put, um, the $12 billion per year, if we were to match that and put that into Bittensor, and we didn't monetize at all, um, is opening up free and sort of incredibly powerful, unlimited, permissionless access to intelligence worth that expense, even if there was no revenue to speak of whatsoever.\nYou know, if you think about the, the, the calculator and how important it is to succeeding and now like having a laptop or something, AI is becoming that.\nSo, you're not going to be able to get through college or anything else at some point or even, you know, a job if you're not using, you know, some sort of AI integration.\nMaybe it's cursor to help you augment your coding or whatever.\nPowerPoint help, grammar checking, you name it.\nUm, so if you're not using these things, you're sort of uncompetitive in the marketplace.\nAnd, um, so, you know, I think it's important that we not lose sight of the fact that opening up AI to the world just to make sure we don't have these siloed things where you have to spend $200 a month to use Claude Pro and then, you know, maybe you're, you're gated access because of the country you live in and all these kinds of things.\nSo let's, you know, before I answer the other question, let's just not lose sight of this is an expense that, um, I think as a global population, we should probably, uh, work on regardless, um, just to make sure we don't sort of leave people behind in the AI landscape.\nUm, that said, what does a breakout, uh, subnet look like?\nAnd, and in terms of revenue, I mean, I think the first one that has sort of massive, massive profit margins and actual demand for it, so you could have 100% profit margin, but if you're only making a dollar a day, does it really matter?\nNo, it doesn't matter.\nSo, um, the first one that has like mass revenue and high profit margins, I think, um, you know, that could just, it would skyrocket emissions if they bought back their token because they're putting in way more, you know.\nSo the alpha pool would basically go to zero and you would only have TAO in it.\nUm, and so the price would be sort of infinite.\nAnd I think, um, you know, there is that possibility.\nUm, but I wonder, you know, usually those kinds of of cycles are short-lived.\nUm, because, you know, let's take for example, any of the agents or or like virtuals or anything else.\nUm, you'll see like massive skyrocketing and then nearly as quickly a massive crater.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI followed that whole thing when it, when it happened.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd so like these, these second and third order apps that are going to be built on top of all the the subnets that exist today.\nUm, you know, if their margins are that high, you can be guaranteed that many, many competitors will jump in the race and then that, you know, the, the actual value proposition is going to drop over time as well, right?\nBecause you're just going to have, have, um, competition.\nAnd so, you know, when I, when I think about Chutes, it's like, we're trying to get that foundational level right for Bittensor because whether, whether we achieve AGI tomorrow, whether it's a brand new agent, whether it's some new thing that, you know, we haven't seen before.\nEither way, it needs to run somewhere, and what better place for it to run than on a permissionless network like Bittensor and, you know, specifically Chutes.\nSo, you know, we're, we're trying to be sort of like the stable foundation for any of these apps that could, you know, blow up, um, to run on.\nAnd you know, I hope that at some point we, we do have something that sort of really achieves escape velocity.\nUm, from our end, you know, the foundation is the most important thing, but we're also trying to build these second and third order apps on top like we did the the agents platform.\nUm, you know, we, we did an alpha version of a chat interface that's going to be similar to like chat GBT, but you can also select whichever model.\nUm, we need to integrate more of the models into it.\nUm, you know, maybe we start doing like a visual, uh, studio type, not visual studio, the IDE, but programming.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nImages and videos and things like that, like I know there's, you know, demand for, uh, sort of translating videos and adding lip sync on top and doing, you know, we can do all of that in Chutes, but we don't have like a place to go do that.\nAnd, um, so these, these apps are where you get the higher profit margins.\nUm, and I think that would help drive revenue.\nAnd so, you know, us as Chutes, I think our team needs to to work on like, okay, we have the foundation now working very well.\nYou can see, um, exponential growth and token usage and model growth and everything else.\nBut now we need to actually start tying all of these models together in a cohesive manner and making these apps that can potentially, you know, have these much higher profit margins that are just making use of the commodity on Chutes.\nUm, so yeah, I think it'll, it'll be a dangerous thing in a sense, um, if you do have one of these completely snowballing subnets because it would dry up everything.\nUm, all emissions would go there over time.\nUm, and I wonder, you know, if it's too short-lived, then, um, yeah, what happens?\nBut we don't want, we don't want a virtual thing because that was, you know, that some of the tokens blew up to like, as I remember, like two billion was one of them.\nAix BT, I think was one of them.\nUm, I get, I get Eliza and the and the virtual thing mixed up because they, they feel like the same thing to me in a lot of ways.\nUm, but yeah, what, what I observed was they were basically chatbots.\nYou know, they're basically memecoins with mouths on on X, right?\nThat's pretty much all they were.\nUm, but the people could see them.\nThey were very visible.\nThey could touch them, taste them, talk to them, you know, and for a lot of people was very magical in the first time that, you know, they'd talk to an AI or an agent like that, right?\nSo, it felt like something very valuable.\nUm, you know, wrongly or rightly, and, um, and it was crypto people who blew it up to like five billion or two billion in valuation and then very quickly realized it was kind of, and down went everything, right?\nSo, um, and that we don't want that cra, we don't want that kind of volatility in the Bittensor world.\nThe bid tensor world is very much more a steer.\nIt's serious people doing serious, right?\nWe don't want to be too serious, but but it is serious people doing serious things.\nAll of you, for the most part, all of the projects are very good attempts at very interesting real things.\nThey're not meme coins with mouths, right?\nSo, um, but getting back to your point about, um, the 12 billion that is spent mining Bitcoin, the reason why those people, why those miners are doing it is because they know they can make money, right?\nThey know it's a business.\nUm, they know that those bitcoins at some point are going to be worth a lot more than what it costs to mine them, right?\nOstensibly.\nThat's the bet anyway.\nIt's largely been true.\nUm, so I, I think in order to have that 12 billion dollars powering AI, and I agree with you, it'd be much better used for powering AI and sort of creating, you know, what a open AI should have been for the world so that anyone of any anywhere on earth can access very powerful AI that's not censored, that's not kneecapped, that services their needs, that doesn't steal their prompts like that.\nWe do want that world.\nI completely agree with that.\nBut that has to be powered by somebody putting money in because they think they're going to get more out, right?\nWhich is what every venture capitalist does.\nThat's what every Bitcoin miner does.\nAnd so that, that sort of, um, that sort of cycle of, you know, I put a dollar in the black box here at this end.\nHow soon does $10 come out the other end?\nThat has to be better known or at least better guessed, I think, than what we figured out collectively in the better universe.\nAnd I think we're on our way there, but we're not there yet.\nDoes that make sense?\nYeah.\nYeah, definitely.\nYeah, I mean, in that respect, like in the actual business sense, I think Bittensor is still pretty early in its evolution, right?\nI mean, so we have, we have a lot of work to do and again, you know, these privacy concerns and and security and stuff like that.\nIt's just something we have to solve as a network.\nUm, you know, dTAO is one way to do it.\nThat there are other technologies and stuff like that, but I think until we have that as like a guarantee, it's really hard to convince an enterprise to give us the dollars that they would otherwise give to, you know, together or whoever.\nSo, um, yeah, but yeah, definitely.\nNo, I, I completely agree.\nThere needs to be revenue.\nI think it doesn't necessarily need to be profitable right away.\nI think it just needs to be something that you have like a plan for.\nUm, and so, you know, even like what we've achieved so far at peak, I think we did about 160 billion tokens in one day.\nUm, and so, you know, the vast majority, something like 90% of that is the Deep Seek.\nUm, I'm looking at the stats right now.\nSo, Deepseek V3 and R1, the new R1, the old R3 or V3, um, stuff like that.\nSo, you know, even, even if we achieved that level, uh, with fully paid, you know, say we charged 50 cents per million input or output.\nUm, that's, that's a pretty good chunk of revenue per day.\nUm, now when we immediately flip that switch though, again, we have this sort of conscious barrier of like, oh, well, you're crypto, so there's that we have to overcome.\nAnd then there's the fact of privacy and, uh, the fact that, you know, we're not a traditional web 2 company that has sort of these established, you know, roots and things like that.\nSo, um, I don't think we'll be immediately able to flip that switch and charge full price and get, you know, like all customers converted from free to paid.\nIt, it, it just won't work that way.\nUm, but I think what we've been trying to show is that number one, the platform works extremely well.\nBittensor works extremely well.\nWe can out compete.\nSo, you know, together AI, when I think if memory serves, and I could be totally wrong here, but if memory serves, when they did their last fundraising round, I think they had mentioned something about 160 billion tokens per day.\nUm, and they\n\n\nI've been around for a while now. You know, Chutes is six months old, and we hit the same numbers in six months because of proper incentive design and Tensor and things like that. So, um, I think the goal for us, um, yes, we obviously want to achieve profitability, and again, it kind of depends on what your definition is, but, um, I think it's again more important to unlock the $10 trillion AI market by getting these AI people to start trusting some of these Crypto projects, and we do that slowly over time, building trust and everything else. And, um, so yeah, no doubt, there has to be, um, I mean, I guess there isn't with Bitcoin, but there has to be some flywheel that people are looking forward to, and we're, we're, we're on our way. We're building it.\n\nYeah. Some thesis, at least some, some, some sort of, you know, at least we know, I think it's here, and I think it works like this. So, we're going to try this model, right? And you maybe it works, maybe it doesn't, but we get, we get those experiments running because somebody's going to crack it. I feel pretty, I pretty, I feel very certain of that actually within the Bittensor universe. So yeah, it is, it is by far the most, you know, the most fertile ground of all these experiments out there by far, in my opinion. So, which is why I'm spending my life studying it. So yes, so we're on the same page.\n\nAnd especially with dTAO. I mean, there wasn't quite as much pressure before, but now, yeah, it's uh, it's very much accelerated things, I think. Well, let's talk about dTAO because actually that's where I was going to go next, right? So, um, I, I think in many ways it's been a great success. Um, you know, technically it was a fantastic success that kind of an upgrade to a chain flawlessly out of the gate, uh, was extremely impressive and all the sort of like, uh, nooks and crannies. You know, I, I have some nits about the UIs of some of the websites, but you know, like TASATs.io worked flawlessly on day one. Like that is, in that is incredible. I was actually very blown away by that. So, because I know, I know the kind of work and the kind of testing that took to achieve that, and that was just insanely awesome. And, and I do think that uh, dTAO has largely been a success, even, even financially, a lot of people did very well out of the gate. Um, I think at the moments we're starting to see sort of, you know, the first challenge of it where a lot of the subnets are, you know, subnets are down, and and some of this is just market volatility, some of this is just the broader market being down, right? Like, like Powell's not cutting rates, so like everybody's depressed and not investing in anything, so you know, that's a big part of it. There's a big drag coming down from macro on everything, uh, but I also think sort of the subnets, there, there is a lot of disagreement on whether the root emissions are too high. The root is too damn high, as I keep saying, right? Um, you know, is, is, so my first question is, is do you think that's true, that people are not coming off of route because the root emissions are too high? So why would I move out of my parents' basement and go and take risks on subnets? Do you think that's a problem? Number two, this morning they just announced, or I saw Con tweet that uh, there has been a limit of 128 subnets at least temporarily imposed for the the foreseeable future, so that no new subnets can be created, which I, I think is a very good move personally. Um, I think it's good gardening, right, if, if you will. Um, so what do you think of that move, and what do you think about the thesis that the route is too damn high?\n\nYeah. So, I think, um, the cap of 128 is, I think, a good move right now. I mean, we already have open slots that are for sale. Um, so, I don't think that there's going to be a ton of pressure anytime soon, even gapping it to 128. I think, um, I think if you're a brand new subnet, um, it might be kind of hard to get out of the immunity period. But at the same time with, with sort of so many teams that, um, have just given up, you know, that was another sort of surprising aspect of dTAO is like a lot of teams just vanished. Not a lot, but some of the... Well, I mean, they were, they were forced to live on their own wits, right? They were no longer sucking off the emissions of the chain and not really doing much, right? So, that this, this forced them into the sunlight, which was the purpose of this whole thing, right? So, I, I think it's, it's market pressures.\n\nYeah. So, I, I think it, it's good and bad, um, in the sense that it's going to have, uh, sort of more competitive force on the subnet teams, which is great. Um, but it will be probably kind of challenging to be a brand new subnet. Um, and like it's, it's actually really hard to get, uh, again, you know, people from the AI web 2 world into the Bittensor world. Um, there's a lot of barriers. There's a lot of sort of things you have to go through. You have to start in, you know, finding and and getting to know the validators. The documentation on substrate is not necessarily the best yet. Um, you know, so there's a lot of hurdles to even start, and if you're trying to convince one of these like super talented teams that will have this breakout moment, um, you know, to get them on board, and then suppose they register the subnet, but then don't dump a bunch of their own funds into it to bump up the price to, you know, sort of get them out of that, uh, dregistration zone, well, then they're probably not going to try again, right? So, I, I think it's, um, slightly dangerous in trying to attract the new talent that we're going to need to push Bittensor forward, but overall, I think it's really good to sort of, uh, drive that competitive pressure up. And I mean, you know, there's this, this idea even in subnets today, this idea of dust, meaning, um, emissions being paid out to miners who aren't truly, you know, adding any value to the subnet. Um, and I think the same thing, you know, is true to an extent. If we had unlimited subnets, we would have unlimited dust paid out to all these subnets that aren't really doing anything. So, um, you know, net benefit, I think it's, it's absolutely the best move, but, uh, or, you know, but maybe some things to think about on attracting talent and and dregistration. Um, and then, um, yeah, sorry, what was the other question? I forgot already. Yeah.\n\nI mean, so there's been a lot of discussion, most of it emanating from um, Ready AI's CEO. Uh, right, about uh, about whether the root emissions are too high, right? And yeah, they, I've seen them as high as like 25% APY. Right now they're sort of floating around 12%. Still pretty good, right? So, so the thesis is, well, you know, only 8.5% of TAO is staked into dTAO. So, you know, the rest of it, you know, 60ish% of it is just hanging out in root, collecting that 12% all fat and happy, right? And and the remainder of it is just liquidity on on centralized exchanges largely. Um, so what do we got to do to get that 60% to sort of move out of route where it's just being, you know, getting fatter every day and become more useful and start betting on some subnets? Are are we paying them too much to just sit there? That's the question.\n\nYeah, it's a good question. I mean, so you know, the one thing I, I think about is, um, all of the money that's not in Bittensor, right? All these, you know, enormously wealthy people and institutions that could potentially invest in Bittensor. Um, if you approach them and say, um, hey, there's this thing called dTAO. It's part of TAO. There's 128 subnets. Every subnet has different, you know, if you try going down that rabbit hole, it's going to be really hard to be like, you know, you should put your million dollars and go research all of the subnets and then, you know, start investing in them. I think it's a really hard sell. And I think the liquidity right now is so small that even if you wanted to invest a huge amount of money into one of the subnets, um, slippage and everything else and with the sort of, um, you know, it's hard to put a lot of money in. It's hard to put a lot of money in, and um, you know, it's very deflationary to an extent, right, or inflationary right now. So, um, I think it's a much easier sell. What we need more than anything is just people getting involved in the TAO ecosystem in general. And so I think for these, you know, institutional dollars, keeping it in root is probably the first step, and it's probably the only step many of them will take initially, um, until they have a team dedicated to actually researching some of the subnets. And even then, I mean, what percentage of the subnets do you think any particular team is going to invest in? It maybe it's, you know, four or five. I mean, how much time do you have for due diligence, how much time... those investors, those institutional people, they won't do that, but they will look for a hedge fund who will go and do that for them, you know, they're basically people who are just living their lives in subnets, right? So, and those, those entities are popping up very quickly. I'm talking to a lot of those people, and I'm even talking to some of those institutional investors that are very wealthy, um, and I can assure you they are looking at this, and they are definitely interested. So, yeah.\n\nSo I mean, pros and cons, right? Like a high root APY is really good for just attracting those dollars that aren't necessarily going to go chase the subnets. And I think that's that's important. But at the same time, subnets are Bittensor. If you don't have, you know, alpha token liquidity and and and money going in, then I mean, what's going to happen to Bittensor? So, um, I think we need to find a balance, but I don't think we should be necessarily, um, you know, we're only how many months in to detail, and we haven't really let it... Yeah. Yeah. So, we're talking about potentially doing these giant changes, um, only a few months in for a system that, um, is enormously complex. And, um, what I heard would, would be sort of a good in between, and I think I don't know that anyone could really argue against it, is, um, that the token holders, the stakers, the root stakers can opt in to having their, um, staking rewards be the alpha tokens that they were proportionally staked to. So like an airdrop basically. So rather than saying root selling goes away, or we drop the proportion from 18 to, you know, whatever, or, you know, something, um, that's a good first step because then anyone who wants to participate directly in the subnets, but doesn't necessarily want to do all of the work of going and and um, investigating each, they can opt in to say, \"Okay, well, I'm just going to stake to these validators on root, whatever, but I want my rewards to be in the alpha tokens,\" and then they wouldn't be auto sold. It would reduce the root sell pressure for all of those who did opt in. Um, it kind of alleviates a lot of, I think, you know, some of the whale, absolute whales of Bittensor would opt into that. Um, so even if it's not 100% of the TAO that opts in, I think it's enough that it would have a pretty noticeable effect on root sell pressure. Um, and this is something, um... I don't know who the origin of the idea is. It's definitely not me. I think, I think it was either Const or um, one of the macrocosmos people, you know, I don't know where the the origin of this idea of the air drops instead of auto root sell, like the opt-in, but I, but I think that, you know, we should, we should be careful, um, we don't want to just upend the whole thing after four months of letting it play out, but something like this would have a net positive effect, I think on... Keith Singry actually had a similar idea. It wasn't exactly what you just said, but he was basically saying what we should do is instead of, he, I'm trying to remember what he... Oh yeah, instead of, instead of, he basically wanted to take the, he, he wanted to like your proposal or like the proposal you just referenced, um, not, you know, reduce the selling, the selling pressure is the issue, right, of of coming out of, out of root to for subnet tokens because it's depressing the price of the subnet tokens with emissions from the chain. So, instead of doing that, he basically said, \"Well, recycle the TAO, um, and just chuck it to the end of, of, you know, basically it doesn't get sold, and it doesn't get burned because we never actually burn TAO. We just throw it, um, we, we throw it in before the having, so it gets recycled back to the end of the line, and that, that's where it goes, and and that at least gets the the boot off the the subnet selling neck, right? So, for the time being, so I kind, I kind of like that idea, and that's it's an idea in a similar vein to the one you just brought up. So, um, yeah, these are, um, yeah, really, really complicated questions. Um, yeah, I'm a, I'm a simple AI backend engineer. So, uh, you're like, it's not my thing, man, I'm out.\n\nYeah. No, it's, it's look, it's a complicated thing, and I, I, my, my personal opinion is that the root emissions are too high, comma, however, I've been surprised by the brilliance of the core Bittensor team several times now, uh, both with the dTAO launch itself, um, and and in sort of the surprisingly good design of of dTAO, because when it, when it first launched, I realized that like, uh, having early information didn't do you any good, right? You basically, the prices are the emit, the way the the subnets are born and they emit their liquidity with just these crazy prices for the subnet tokens, at least initially, makes it so whales can't just come in and slurp the whole thing. That design is fantastic, right? Like I love that, and it defeats, it defeats everything that's bad about meme coins and, you know, the the the broader crypto world at large. So, I, I have great respect for sort of the ingenuity of these designs, not being immediately obvious, or at least not to me, and me later figuring out like, oh, that, I see why they did that now. That's actually great. I, I actually applaud this.\n\n\nUm, so even though I think, you know, perhaps it's the wrong move to reduce the root emissions because it upsets some other part of, you know, this carefully constructed thing that they've put a lot more thought into than I have. So I I don't, you know, I'm not sure if I'm right, but that, but from the outside looking in, it does look like to me that the root emissions are too high, or at least the selling pressure should be alleviated in the near term. I do think the reduction of, you know, basically taking, making the move to um, limit the number of subnets to 128 is indirectly uh, attacking this root emission problem, right? By by stopping the gushing of of new emissions because, you know, each new subnet that's born gushes a bunch of new emissions into root and artificially jacks up that, you know, that the APY and creates a lot more sell pressure, right? So, so at least, you know, so it indirectly affects that. So it's probably constant acknowledging that there's something you should do here in part and but not without actually directly monkeying around with the inards of what is probably a very carefully constructed um, emission schedule that, you know, if you monkey with it, it has other effects that I don't know about. So,\nanyway, end of speech on that. Um, hopefully we'll get there. Hopefully we'll figure it out. I I think I think the other the other side of that equation is that um, what would also solve it is a lot more buying of subnet tokens from a lot more money coming into the ecosystem. And from where where I sit, that looks like it's about to stampede in from institutionals as well as I'm not sure about consumer. I used to think consumer is going to because of all the bridges to Salana and Ethereum and all that stuff, that stuff is coming and I think it will have a material effect. But I actually think the institutional money all tutor um, you know, all we're seeing an announcement of a new hedge fund or a new uh, tow treasury company every day. Um, so I I think that money is coming. I think it'll arrive with a suddeness that surprises a lot of people and I think a good part of it will go into subnet tokens. So that that also solves the problem, right? So,\nyeah.\nYeah, let's hope. I mean, I, you know, I think again, revenue is also going to play a part there, right? Because that's going to drive token buying. So, I mean, you know, we could all all the subnets can work on that at least.\nYeah. So, uh, so we're almost up on the hour here. Uh, one last question before we go. So, I my I'm told that um, one of one of your core devs is a guy named Namay. Is that correct?\nWell, yeah. So, Namay is sort of uh, the founder of Rayon Labs.\nSo, I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily call him a core dev. I would call him sort of the the rayon mastermind.\nOkay. And he's he's not docs, so we don't know who he is, right? Is that that's correct also? And um, and and and my understanding is he's sort of the driver behind Deepseek getting up like within 3 seconds of release. Like he's sort of responsible for a lot of those things. Is that true or not? Or am I giving giving credit?\nYeah. No, that's fake news. That's fake news.\nWell, then never mind. All right.\nNo. No. So, so Namay um, he's actually sort of, so he originally he was doing subnet 19, right? Um, he was the the lead, you know, core dev subnet owner from pre-detail days,\num, and then he uh, you know, sort of at the end of the year, I forget when gradients registered, but um, so he has sort of stepped more uh, like up, I guess, to a more management type level where he's actually coordinating gradients 19 and CHUTES, um, because he is the sort of the founder of of Rayon. Um, so uh, the actual core AI and and backend work. So it's my fault those models get up so fast, um, because I'm like obsessed.\nOkay. So it's it's you. You're the guy doing it. Okay.\nBut um, but no, yeah, I mean, Namay um, at this point he's he's definitely got a lot on his plate with managing the three subnets. So, he doesn't get into like the AI deployment necessarily on CHUTES very, very often.\nGot it. Okay. All right, John. Listen, thank you so much for taking an hour to uh, explain this little world to us. Uh, super fascinating. And if you have something you want to plug, like websites or or Twitter handles, now is the time. What do you got?\nYeah, I mean, just head over to chutes.ai. We've got some uh, we just hired a marketing company to start writing some sort of educational blogs about how CHUTES works and things like that. So that'll be good. Um, head over to squad.ai to play with the Asian platform. Um, you can go to corell and use the models. Check out tow stats. Buy a bunch of TAO. Um,\nyep.\nYeah.\nOkay. Excellent. And the uh, the Twitter handle the official CHUTES Twitter handle is\nchutes_ai\nand then there's also Rayon Labs\nrayon_labs\nis the parent one. Very good. All right, John, thank you once again. My name is Mark Jeffrey. This has been Hash Rate. We'll see you all next time.\nThanks.\n",
