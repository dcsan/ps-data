  "cleanText": "Today we're going to cover Chutes.\n\nNow, Chutes is the number one subnet in Bittensor, and what they do is they provide decentralized compute as a service to run the popular AI model: DeepSeek, Mistral, all that stuff. Your options right now are: you go to AWS, you load it up yourself, you know, you set up the scalability yourself, or you can go to Chutes and just find the model you want to run, push a button, and boom, it's up and running. You don't have to have any IT staff. You don't have to monkey around with all the inards of AWS. It's like using Squarespace to make a website versus trying to, you know, do the HTML and set up the servers yourself, right? A lot easier to go to Squarespace. So, Chutes is basically Squarespace for AI models. And it's become massively popular. In fact, so much so that if you go to open router, you'll see DeepSeek, the free version. The bulk, the majority of the serving of DeepSeek that's going on right now is coming out of the Chutes network. So, massive win for Chutes.\n\nThe other sort of advantage to running a Chutes version of AI is that it costs 85% less than what you would pay elsewhere, which is absolutely mind-blowing, right? So, you know, you can pay six times more if you want, but if you'd like to pay less, use it. It's a lot easier, and it costs a lot less.\n\nOkay, so some of the use cases for Chutes include text to video. So, pretty self-explanatory. Type something in, and it makes a video based on what you typed in. Image editing, rentals, model training. So, model training is where you know if you want to make a vertical version of an AI. So, let's say you want to make a customer service rep for your company. Well, that customer service rep has to be trained on the data associated with your company, right? So, you've got to give, you've got to let it chew on everything it can find out and everything it can know about your company so it can be an effective customer service representative. So, you need to train the model up on the specific information of your company and making it an expert. So, that's one of the things Chutes provides. AI transcription. So, you know, taking this video and writing out what I said, that kind of thing. Music generation, so creating new music, you know, basically based on inferring what good music is from a bunch of samples of music. AI content moderation. So, someone who is, you know, or an AI that is sitting in a chat room looking for people disobeying the rules and you know, muting them or kicking them out, that sort of thing. Chat GPT, midjourney style user interfaces, so you know what we're used to sort of from the consumer big AI companies. And custom models and AI workflows.\n\nSo, Chutes has achieved almost 160 billion tokens processed per day. So, that's you know, AI tokens. So, token in AI speak is an idea, you know, it sort of represents a neuron. So, every time inference hits one of these tokens, that's a processing of the token. So, 160 billion pro tokens processed per day is extraordinarily large, right? It's roughly where Google was a year ago. So, Chutes is still behind some of the centralized guys, but the fact that it's moving as fast as it is with a decentralized infrastructure powering it is absolutely insane. And in fact, the Chutes AI cube compute token demand has grown 250x since January, which is absolutely nuts, right?\n\nSo, now Chutes used to offer free AI, and then it started charging in $TAO, the native token of the Bittensor ecosystem, a small amount, not a large amount, but a small amount. And now they will accept fiat payments, so you can swipe a credit card. You don't have to worry about getting $TAO, you don't have to worry about crypto at all. You don't have to even know that crypto is involved in any way with the Chute ecosystem. You're just an AI person, you want to swipe a credit card and get your AI now.\n\nNow, if you are a crypto person and you in fact you care about the Bittensor ecosystem, all the revenue that Chutes is generating, both fiat and $TAO, is going back to buy back their alpha token. So, the Chutes, if you understand the Bittensor ecosystem, each subnet in Bittensor, Chutes being one of them, has its own alpha token which rises or falls in value just like any crypto token. And the alpha tok, and they're called alpha tokens, the alpha token for Chutes, all of the revenue that Chutes generates is going to pay, is going to buy back their alpha token. So, this is a great motivation to own the Chutes alpha token if you believe in what they're doing.\n\nOkay. Now a little bit of insight from a guy named Siam, who's a big hedge fund guy in the Bittensor ecosystem. He highlighted something on a site called $TAO.app where if you sort of scroll down to this section, it basically shows because there's a bunch of emissions pressure coming out of the Bittensor blockchain itself. The block, the blockchain is emitting new tokens just like the Bitcoin blockchain emits new bitcoin with every block. Bittensor emits $TAO, and it also emits subnet tokens. And right now the subnet tokens are in sort of an early state. So, they're emitting quite a large number of new alpha tokens. So, this interface tells you how much buy pressure there has to be to buy up the new alpha tokens that are emitted with over a 72-minute period to for the subnet price to remain equal, so to not move at all, right? So, if there's, so the amount of buying pressure required to offset the amount of alpha token emissions by the blockchain. So, for Chutes, it's rather high because Chutes emits a lot of new alpha tokens because it's got one of the highest market caps in the entire Bittensor ecosystem, which dictates that it emits the most tokens, right? This can be good for you if you hold the Alpha tokens in your wallet because those emissions are also flowing to you. But the problem is is that if you want, you you have to make sure the selling pressure offsets the buying, you have to make sure the buying pressure offsets the selling pressure. So, in this instance with Chutes, you need 943 $TAO. So, roughly $4,000 worth of $TAO bought every 72 hours, right? So, if you multiply that by 20 because there's 20 72-hour periods within 20 24-hour period. So, over the course of a day, you need $80,936 worth of buying to offset the token emissions. Right? So, now we know that Chutes is using all the revenue they're generating to buy to offset this the sell pressure. So, what does that look like? Well, that's $61,000 of revenue per week based on one of their latest reports. So, that comes out to $8,714 per day of buy pressure. So, does that $8,714 per day of buy pressure offset the $80,936 worth of sell pressure? No, it offsets, you know, roughly a tenth of it, right? So, so the ninet of the buying pressure has to come from somewhere else, and that's just the demand for the Chutes token since it's the number one token in the Bittensor ecosystem. We expect that that will do very well over the last several weeks or so. It has not done well. There's been a lot more sell pressure than buy pressure. But it appears at this time to be sort of rounding out and and coming off, you know, bouncing off of a bottom. And it's still the number one subnet in the Bittensor ecosystem. So, you know, it could have a bright future. It's hard to tell, but we'll see what happens when subnet tokens are available on Solana, which we expect to happen any day now. And then also when institutional starts buying subnets in in larger amounts, which we also expect. There's a lot of reports of new hedge funds and treasury funds booting up right now that aren't, haven't quite deployed yet. So, we're, you know, we're hoping for great things, and all indications are that we should see a lot more buying of subnet tokens.\n\nSo, what's the size of this market? Well, the AI inference market is a $106 billion industry at the moment. It's expected to rise to 255 billion, that's in USD, in the coming coming years. So, that's it for this Bittensor brief. We're going to do a couple of these over the next few weeks. I'm participating in the Bitcast network as a minor. So, this is sort of an experiment to see how this goes. I'll report back once I know more.\n",
