I am a fan of the show, of course, and now it's an honor to be on your show, dude. I'm a fan of you and uh and I can't believe we we've never met before like sort of a couple weeks ago, right?\n\nI know. And we were talking about we have so many mutual friends and mutual experiences going back to the '90s, like 30 years of mutuality.\n\nYeah. No, that's pretty, it's pretty crazy. Um, so I was going to talk about, well, let's just start off by saying, uh, you are now, well, you're doing several things, but one of the things you're doing is you're running a TAO treasury company. So sort of a micro strategy but of TAO, uh, called TAOSynergies with a ticker of TAOx. And you put out a press release recently, or or the company did, uh, saying that, uh, you all had bought $10 million worth of TAO for your fund. Um, which is great, but there was a quote in there from you and it said, uh, Decentralized AI and TAO reminds me of The Internet in 1996 or Bitcoin in 2013 or 2014. Um, really interesting because I consider you to be like one of these Harbinger people. You're sort of like Forrest Gump. Like if you're in the room, like something's going on, right? And it's in every good.\n\nYeah. So tell, tell, why don't you run us through kind of your history for for those who don't know, because it's a rich history.\n\nYeah. And so, so I have a, I mean, I have a computer science background from way back, but also, and and you know, I went to undergrad computer science, graduate school in computer science. So, I was really early to the web. Like, basically, when the first web servers were out there, I got obsessed and was already making websites. I'm talking about like 1992, '93. My friends and I were already kind of making websites. And when I moved to New York City, I wanted to write the great American novel. I left graduate school. I spent years trying to write a a a bad novel. But maybe through that time I put in my 10,000 hours of of writing. So, So I've kind of had these these forked careers. Like I've been in the finance.\n\nI didn't know you were a novelist also. That's that, dude, that's awesome. Did you, is that, did you publish any of that?\n\nI, I did, although anonymously, but I published a lot of non-fiction books. So I've done a lot of what I call narrative non-fiction. Maybe like, you know, I've written about my own experiences of making money, going completely broke, bouncing back, going broke again, making money again, and kind of going through all the experiences that happened along the way. And I did it kind of in a literary way as opposed to a self-help sort of way. And so I, so I think my, the years I spent writing bad novels helped me, uh, for for when I, you know, actually, you know, I've written about, I've published about 25 books now and you know, I've written millions of words and uh, so, so that's been a big part of my life is the is the writing side, but it, it brought me to New York City. I took a job at HBO. And what I realized when I got to New York City, and this is like 1994, is that there were maybe, and we probably knew all the same people, there were maybe 10 people who knew how to make a website, and I was one of them.\n\nYeah. Were you, were you on the whack list?\n\nConsortium? You were on that list. Okay.\n\nYeah. And and there was, there was a bunch of like early lists, like whether it was the well in like California or you know, Echo, Echo NYC was the one that was on the east coast.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Echo. Um, yeah. Remember, remember the, there was um, I think Echo was being hosted on Panix. Remember there was just all these early like internet service providers that that you know, I remember fondly and you know, nobody knew what this web thing was going to be. Like I really wanted it and liked it as a artistic medium so that uh, you know, oh, there was going to be 3D art, like hyper, like instead of writing a novel, you could write a hypertext, you know, book, like what would that be? And so nobody knew it was going to be this commercial thing, right? So, but then at some point you realize, oh, wait a second, every single company on the planet is going to need a website and zero of them have websites. So then, and nobody knew how, again, nobody knew how to make a website. So, somebody like me who was like dirt broke, didn't own a suit, had nothing going for me, but American Express needed a website, here's $200,000 to make a website. Like, I had no money at all. And suddenly, like, people were paying me. And I had a full-time job. I was making an entire $40,000 a year as a junior programmer analyst at HBO. And then, I, my brother-in-law was like a designer, so I showed him this thing, the web, and I was a software guy. And so together we were doing like American Express.com, we did HBO.com, we did, you know, all, all the record labels, all the movie studios in New York City. Like we did all of them because there was nobody else.\n\nYeah. And uh, uh, and so I, I, you felt it then, like everybody was saying to me, \"Oh, is this just going to be a fad? Is this like, you know, there's no, what do you need the web for? It's just a bunch of academics. There's nobody really on the web. Like we have, we have two million customers. What do we need the web for?\"\n\nYeah. I was, I was, I was just talking to somebody yesterday who's, who's a young person, sort of like early 30s, and I was explaining to them how, you know, they're, they're, they're now a big TAO person, right? And and I'm, and and he's sort of confused why people don't believe in him. I was like, oh no, the early web, nobody knew that this was going to be a commercial thing, like exactly what you're describing, right? Like you thought it was an artistic medium almost, like, you know, I don't know, like, um, like Vermal or or like the Vision Pro or something.\n\nWhen Vermal came out, that was great, virtual the reality, you know, markup language.\n\nYeah. So, we, we didn't know. It was a, it was a full-on commercial thing, right? Until, and and then suddenly it became obvious, but it was not obvious looking forward. There's a lot of people who were like, \"Ah, the web, The Internet and the web is bullshit.\" We didn't even know. We thought maybe AOL or Prodigy was going to be what we later knew knew of as the web, right? It was not at all clear that the open web was going to win.\n\nWell, by the way, and that's a good analogy. Prodigy was an example of centralized networking and social networking and the the web, of course, nobody really realizes the history, like how much the web changed. There used to be something called network programming. Like if you work for a company like, I don't know, JP Morgan, if you're making an application that everybody at JP Morgan is going to use, you also have to write the network, the networking software, like the networking interface, that all disappeared because the web became the only network. It was this decentralized network that connected, you know, disparate computers and and disparate corporate networks and so on. That's why it was this beginning of decentralization on the planet. And uh, but yeah, nobody really, it kind of came out of academia and and and the academics sort of resented the people from AOL being unleashed on the news groups on on The Internet and then eventually the web and all the academics were saying we need to build Internet 2.0, know, now just to get rid of all the riffraff. But it was this, but it was this, and and you're right, everybody, even in 2000, so by 2000, I had already sold my company that was making websites and I was in a venture capital, I, I, I was a partner in a venture capital firm and it was...\n\nYou made a big pile of money and then...\n\nI did, but then I went 100% broke. Like I went from, I went from zero to $15 million, okay, in in in 1989, '98, 199, I sold my company in 1998, 1999 was very good, beginning of 2000 was very good, and I'm like, oh man, but I, I had like a sickness, like I thought, okay, everybody's making 15 million, I have to make more than that, and I had a real, like, it was almost like a brain disorder, and and of course, when you try to make, when you try to turn 15 into 100, it's much more easy to to lose it than make it. Yeah.\n\nAnd there's three skills to money. There's, there's making it, keeping it, growing it. And I was not very good at keeping it. And uh, at that time I had to really work hard to learn how to, how to do that. I had again, some sort of psychological issue almost.\n\nAnd it's called being a DGEN.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe have a name for it now.\n\nYeah. Right. And and so I, I, I, but I remember though, I was before actually going completely broke, I was at this venture capital firm and it was during the the beginnings of the internet bust and I remember just one of my, uh, we were playing this arcade game I had in my office, Defender, and one of my partners who was a a banker, uh, he just, he got, he lost the game on the on Defender and he just hit the screen. He cracked the screen and he's like, \"This internet thing is bullshit.\" and he just walked out and I never saw him again. Like he quit the firm, everything. And and then I went broke and just lost everything. And that firm shut down and I lost my home. I just went broke and had to start from scratch. Had to move out of the city and and and start.\n\nAnd this is what, this is after the dot bubble broke, right? Does that, and then 9/11 happened. It was kind of like a one-two punch as I remember it, right? And the, and I literally, like, I had cashed out when I sold my company. I didn't sell for, I had cashed out of, I did sell for stock, but I cashed out of the stock. So I had cash. Yeah. And then I just lost it all. So I went from 15 million to about $143 in the bank. And and and I'm, I'm not, I'm 143 is very specific because I remember the exact same account that had one, once had that 15 million in it. I just had $143 left. I had two babies. I was losing my house, and of course everybody's your friend on the way up. Nobody's your friend on the way down. So, yeah, I couldn't get, I couldn't do anything. I couldn't, I didn't know what I was going to do. I thought I was going to die. And uh, it was hard work to kind, and I thought also I had won the lottery. Like I didn't know anything at that time about business, but I thought I did. But it turns out it was just this big internet thing and I didn't and I just got lucky. And would I ever win the lottery again like that? And so...\n\nWell, I do remember that 2000 to like 2005 time frame as being very depressing because you didn't, we didn't know whether like, you know, startups or The Internet, uh, was going to come back like it had been in the sort of late '90s, like it, it felt like that would never happen again, right? And we weren't really sure that it would.\n\nAnd and you're right, because like, take just take a random year during those years, like 2002, 2003, even when things were starting to tick back a little bit in 2003, still nobody really wanted to put their credit card in The Internet.\n\nOh, it was going to get hacked or stolen or whatever. I think the time, the first time when people really felt comfortable, like, oh, this is here to stay, you used, you said the year 2005, and guess what happened in 2005, that's when there was a, finally there became a billion users around the world of the of The Internet, and I think that was the tipping point for The Internet, and I think a similar thing, by the way, is going to happen with Crypto and Bitcoin, like right now. So about two years ago, I remember reading there were about two or 300 million users, and just a few weeks ago I read there's about 500 million users worldwide of Crypto, and and a lot of that's outside the US, because it's people in Iran, for instance, that need dollars because eventually their currency is going to collapse, and people in Argentina were collecting Crypto because they're worried they're, you, so it's outside of the US that a lot of these users are, although, you know, at least half of it's the, the US, and but that was the big tipping point for The Internet, and and it was kind of a tipping point for social media as well, that number, because you know, there... There was early social media, like you, if you remember Geocities or whatever, that was here in LA.\n\nYep.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And then there was um, Friendster and then there was MySpace, and MySpace didn't quite hit a billion users. I think it hit, you know, a couple hundred million users, and then Facebook was the thing that hit a billion users, and then social media off, off to the races at that point. It was like 2007, '08, and then um, you know, and then Crypto starts 2009, of course, with with Bitcoin. And around 2013, I was exposed to it and I started, at first I thought, oh, this is just a Ponzi scheme, Bitcoin. Someone had asked me on Twitter, what do you think of Bitcoin? I'm like, oh, you know, BS, Ponzi scheme.\n\nYou know what I thought it was? Do you remember Flu from the '90s?\n\nYeah. Um, what was the guy, um, Bob Lesson?\n\nYes. And then Whoopi Goldberg did the commercials for it on TV, right? So for... For those that don't know, it was a centralized digital currency. And so there was a big server somewhere that kept track of who had what dollars. And and the pitch was, go online and buy Flu so that you can use it online. And everybody was like, why the [ __ ] would I do that? Like I have dollars. Why would I, why would I use this thing, right? And and I guess it was supposed to be some sort of like, you know, precursor to PayPal. And that was kind of the pitch. But it just, it never made any sense. It never took off. It was a big failure. When I first heard about Bitcoin, I was like, \"Oh, this is just Flu again. I've seen this before. or it doesn't work,\" and I just didn't get that it was decentralized. That was my reaction to it.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So, I had a similar kind of reaction and then um, I got an email from a friend of mine, Naval Ravikant, who was like, \"No, no, no.\"\n\nOh, you know? Oh, okay.\n\nYeah. Yeah. No, Naval. Naval, I know, I've known for a long time. And Kamal, his brother, uh, is one of my...\n\n\nClosest friends.\nAnd, uh, Naval said, \"No, no, no. Let's sit down. I'll explain Bitcoin to you.\"\nAnd so, this was around April of 2013.\nAnd I was blown away.\nLike, we just spent the day going over everything from the technology and the code to the tokconomics, the economics, the use cases, smart contracts, the whole thing.\nAnd he's obviously a very convincing guy.\nI was like, I went from being from dismissing it to being an evangelist for it.\nAnd I had a book coming out in June of 2013 called Choose Yourself.\nAnd I decided, you know what?\nBitcoin is like this choose yourself currency.\nLike, you nobody is forcing you to use it.\nYou choose to use it.\nAnd so, I made a Bitcoin only store, which sold one thing, which was an early release of my book.\nAnd I sold 60 copies PDFs of my book from this Bitcoin only store for one-tenth of a Bitcoin each.\nThat is amazing.\n60 people paid the equivalent of what's now $12,000 for a PDF of my book.\nAnd wow.\nSo, and I went on CNBC to talk about Bitcoin, and I remember the guy on CNBC, the anchor said, \"Are you just doing this as a marketing stunt?\"\nAnd I said, \"Well, I'm on national TV right now.\"\nSo, it worked.\nSo, that was when I was trying to get into Bitcoin.\nBut it was clear that it was early, right?\nIt didn't have that billion users, didn't even have 100 million users.\nNo.\nSo, it was not clear at all.\nAnd even when I was really advocating for it, I started a newsletter or a research service about Bitcoin in 2017 and 2018.\nPeople really were angry at me.\nLike, they did not like me for doing this.\nLike, the Crypto people thought I was making it too simplified, and the non-crypto people thought I was scamming them.\nSo, is this now is this the thing that I saw those ads for?\nBecause that was that was my first encounter of you, right?\nSo, it said it has a picture of you and it said cryptogenius reveals the next Bitcoin.\nDude, it was a beautiful, it was a great ad because it stays in my brain, right?\nLike, to me, it was like one of those classic all-time ads.\nI mean, I think, and look, I have to give credit, like, there was a company that, I mean, I didn't make the ads.\nI hated them.\nAll right.\nI hated being exposed like that.\nBut, but somebody's explained to me that, listen, the scammers are actually using ads, and if you don't use, and I was like, I don't want to do these ads, and they're like, if you don't use ads, then the scammers win.\nLike, they're the ones who everyone's going to subscribe to their research services, and they really are scamming.\nOrlando Baton did this video.\nYou know, nice guys often have to use bad techniques because if you don't use them, then the bad guys who do use them will always win.\nAnd so, I don't know.\nI use that to rationalize the ads.\nBut it, it didn't work.\nAnd I really, my point to the crypto community was, if you want widespread acceptance of Bitcoin, you have to be able to explain it to Main Street America.\nAnd that's what my goal was.\nI remember one time I was so frustrated.\nEveryone was just trashing me on Twitter because of these ads.\nAnd so, it was 2:00 in the morning, like, on a Saturday night, and I put my phone number on Twitter, and I said, \"If anyone really has a problem with me, call me right now.\"\nAnd, uh, I ended up on the phone for the rest of the night, including with, I think it was Jackson Palmer, the founder of Dogecoin, called, and I explained to him, I really have good intentions here.\nBut the, you know, the only way I'm going to get this message out is by doing these ads.\nBut actually, look at the content before you judge me.\nI'm trying to explain Bitcoin so that people could understand it.\nSo that Main Street America could use this.\nIt's very important.\nYou can't just go around hodling everything.\nMain Street America doesn't know what that word means.\nYou can't go around talking about smart contracts and blockchain.\nNo one knows what that means.\nDoesn't make any sense to people.\nSo, you have to show people that there actually is value here.\nThere's a million man hours of code.\nThere's, there's billions of dollars of incentives, you know, and electricity being used every year on this.\nYou have to, you have to explain that there actually is real value.\nAnd, you know, and, and he, to his credit, Jackson Palmer, he, he got it what I was doing.\nBut, you know, to this day, people still criticize me for those those ads, but I was a believer, and, and I've have been ever since, and I've, I've been running, I've been writing about Crypto ever since, among other activities I do.\nAnd we'll leave out the part where I went broke, started another company, sold that, went broke again, and finally, hopefully, I'm over the going broke thing.\nBut, um, uh, you, and then, and then, you know, around 2018, I was writed writing actively about all the different Crypto tokens that I liked, but there wasn't really, you still had this feeling, there wasn't really tokens, it was unclear how would you know a token was going to be used or not, there weren't any users yet.\nSo, like Zcash, for instance, was a good idea, it was a good technology, but there weren't any users of Zcash.\nSo, yeah, know, Zcash was dead end.\nBut what, what did you think about Ethereum?\nEthereum, I recommended it around $300, uh, to my subscribers.\nEthereum, I liked, basically, in 2018, the only things I liked were Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nAnd then it wasn't until later that I started to like, like, so, for instance, to, you know, Bittensor, I recommended to my subscribers in 2023 at about 49.\nLike, that seemed to me like it was.\nYeah, great recommendation.\nSorry.\nGo ahead.\nYeah, it was good.\nI mean, TAO's done very well, and, and it will continue to do well.\nLike, it seemed to me that was a good model.\nLike, I read that white paper, and I was, you know, compared to others, I was late to TAO, but compare, obviously, compared to many, I was early, but, uh, the white paper made sense to me, like, provide an incentive mechanism for people to, to create, you know, AI models or, or help others create AI models, and that seemed brilliant to me.\nSo, I liked TAO.\nI liked a few others, but look, out of, out of the 2 million or so Crypto tokens out there, maybe still only a handful are going to succeed.\nTAO being, of course, one of them, and, and a few others, right?\nSo, what, let's dive into TAO now because we're, we're here.\nSo, TAO is this, I, I think of it as a sort of generalized incentivization alignment engine, uh, that's mostly used for AI projects, but not exclusively, um, but, but probably like, you know, 80, 90% AI projects, um, and I think it, I think that it has the potential to eventually start beating, uh, the very large, very centralized companies, just as the internet beat AOL and Prodigy and all those things, and that was not obvious at the time, just as Linux beat out OS2 and Microsoft NT, you know, all those things, right?\nUm, I, I think so, too.\nWe're in, we're in that movie in AI, where right now the big centralized companies are winning, but this little, you know, kind of startup TAO, Bittensor thing is booting up, and already it's showing massive success in the petri dish, it's showing that it's got teeth when this thing, when this little baby shark, you know, turns into a grown-up shark.\nIt's going to start chewing through the ocean and ships and every other creature that it runs into.\nThat's what it looks like to me.\nWhat do you see?\nI, I see that also.\nAnd, but, but look, Mark, you're, you're so knowledgeable in the space, so I'm going to ask you questions, too.\nAnd I want to play devil's advocate a little bit.\nYou know, obviously, I'm doing a deep dive in the space.\nYou know, my company just bought $10 million worth of towel.\nLike, we're, we're, we're going to be buying more and more.\nLike, I'm, I'm, I'm neck deep in this.\nI'm neck deep in in the entire ecosystem fairly quickly.\nLike, even though I've been writing about it for years, it's, it's maybe in the past six months that I've done the the real deep dive that, uh, you know, getting into all the Subnets and and and the real mechanics of it.\nAnd I agree with you, and there's going to be challenges, like, like take Linux.\nLinux is such a great example of open-source, and, and open source has strong connections to decentralization, but Linux is a great example of they open sourced Unix.\nUnix was was developed by AT&T.\nIt was a corporate product, and Linux came along as an open-source version, but no company, like, no company was going to make a product using Linux.\nThey needed it to be cleansed.\nSo, some companies were created, like Red Hat or VA Linux to help cleanse Linux and make it, you know, their their pitch to the IBMs of the world was like, \"Yeah, yeah, don't use, you're not going to use Linux directly.\nYou might get fired that way, but use us.\nWe'll do what you need to do for you with, we're the corporate guys who will fix Linux for you.\"\nAnd, and that worked.\nThey were like the front door to to Linux.\nAnd, um, you know, I think, I think Bittensor needs some of those front doors now.\nLike, when I look at a lot of the Subnets, I think to myself, this subnet is an incredibly good idea.\nWhy do I, in order to use it?\nWhy do I have to, you know, put in my TAO public key in order to just use this as a consumer?\nYeah.\nLike, I just want to say click go and and have it work.\nLike, so, so, and I, I respect that, like, this towel is at that point where it's like the internet in in the 90s.\nIt's like mostly technical people, or Bitcoin, look, when I made my Bitcoin only store, even in 2013, it was technically very difficult to do.\nNobody knew how to do it.\nI called coin, found a way to do it, to be honest.\nYeah, no, I, I, I, and look, I was a developer, I was a software, I, and I couldn't really do it.\nSo, I called Coinbase.\nCan you help me out?\nThey're like, \"Nah, nah.\"\nSo then I called Fred Wilson.\nHe's like, \"Hey, you invested in Coinbase.\nHow come they can't help me?\"\nAnd Fred's like, \"Yeah, they should be able to help you, but I don't know.\"\nAnd so, finally, I found a developer to to help me out.\nBut Bittensor has a lot of, you know, technical people starting businesses, and there it needs now more user-friendly frontends.\nIt needs more marketing.\nIt needs more, you know, consumer-facing or even corporate-facing.\nLook, if I, shoots, shoots, for instance, is a great subnet.\nIf I'm a dentist and I want to put my my AI persona on my website, and I have kind of a bunch of things that are special about me as a dentist, I want to be able to easily feed that into shoots, come back with like an AI widget that represents me and put it on my website.\nBut right now, to some extent, you have to be a little bit of a developer to to do that.\nYeah.\nAnd, and I'm a dentist.\nI'm not a developer.\nUh, so, so now I gotta, who am I going to call even?\nI don't know who am I going to, I don't know what to do.\nSo, I just don't do it.\nAnd, or maybe I use open AI, which is 10 to 100 times more expensive.\nBut I think with shoot, so, like, the customer is the developer, right?\nIn the same way, the customer of AWS is the developer, right?\nThe dentist is not going to use AWS either, and that's a mature product, right?\nBut that's because consumer products that already been developed, like Dropbox and Google Cloud and and Apple's cloud and so on.\nGoogle, so, so, but, but look, even like 19.AI, which, uh, which is subnet 19, where you can do, um, text to image, you know, and, and, you know, you can do inference, text inference, uh, it's still, every time I go there and I use that subnet quite a bit, every time I go there, it, I have to figure out, oh, where was it again, what's the right button to click?\nLike, it's, it's so, by the way, these are not criticisms of these subnets.\nI think these sub, these are two of many examples that are great subnets that have a lot of value that they're undervalued at this point.\nBut, no, I'm completely with you.\nAnd in fact, I, in previous episodes of Hash Rate, there's like maybe five or six of them where I make the same complaint about there being no front door.\nI'm, I'm, but I was more, and I use those exact words, too.\nBut I was talking more about, like, um, you know, how do I find my way to the Subnets and what are they all doing and how do I buy them?\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo, there's TAT, there's TAO.app, done by our mutual friend Joe Jax.\nLike, these are great sites, but still, I want something, they're not good enough yet.\nEven, even I love JJ, but even JJ's, I personally, I think Backrop has done the best job, but, you know, even that is not consumer enough.\nAnd, and it'll get there.\nLike, it reminds me of, you know, again, we're, we're talking really early internet.\nI mean, look, there was, I don't know what, you know, the World Wide Web Worm was, like, the first search engine that Tim Berners-Lee actually developed, and then there was EI Galaxy, that was a little bit of a search engine.\nI mean, these things were very early stage, and they were just the beginnings of a front door.\nGoogle became like the, the ultimate, you know, Yahoo was making a directory, like a list.\nI remember when big list, and they weren't doing a search engine.\nThey were making a directory.\nYeah.\nIt was just a big list, and, and, and, and that's fine.\nLike, okay, all these technologies need, need a front door, and it'll happen with bit, like, any problem that we talk about is an opportunity because Bittensor's already reached escape velocity the way the web did once Netscape and Mosaic was around.\nYes.\nBut, uh, but it still needs that, that really nice front door, or, or in the case of Subnets, all the front doors, and it'll happen.\nI would encourage anybody listening to this website, go start a business.\nAnyone who starts a business at the front door, either helping the Subnets make their own front doors or, or just doing it yourself.\nMake the front doors to all these things.\nUm, you know, you're going to win.\nYou're going to have a good, successful business.\nYou could be like the Red Hat of of Bittensor.\nIt reminds me of, you know, so what's the fastest growing DeFi exchange right now?\nIt's Hyperlid.\nAnd what makes Hyperlid a little special?\nIt has a very nice user-friendly front interface.\nThe Sushi Swap doesn't.\nPancake Swap doesn't.\nDYDX didn't.\n\n\nT and Hyperlid\ncrushed DYDX in the derivatives trading space, and so Bit Tensor is going to need that. And then again, which is also a problem and opportunity, but then also there's another challenge, which is you have Facebook giving $100 million pay packages for AI programmers, and Bit Tensor's incentives have to compete with that somewhat. And so I think the subnets, that's I think they think that magically because they've got these, you know, sub tokens, they can use as incentives that everything's going to work out. But you still have to think of incentives like a businessman thinks of incentives. Like what are these incentives really? What are they really worth? What are they, how do you value them? Why should someone mine on your subnet and to get your incentives? Like you have to be, you still have to be creative with the incentives. It's not just about you got these tokens. So, so that area of Bit Tensor needs a little bit of work as well. Facebook knows what incentives they're using. Here's a $100 million dollars. Work for me.\nYeah, it's crazy.\nWell, let me, so, let me push back a little bit on that one because I, there was, there was an interesting sort of thought that popped up on the, on the very last All-In podcast, um, where Chimath was talking about something he calls the bitter lesson. And the bitter lesson is that what Elon did with self-driving cars is he just basically threw a bunch of GPU at it. Just sort of brute force, right? Just insane amounts of GPU, insane amounts of data. And that resulted in the best uh self-driving car. And it wasn't really about the brains or the engineers. And the bitter, the bitter lesson is that we don't matter that much, that really it's just the raw volume of compute that wins. So if that's true, right? And um, and Bitensor is, um, I don't know why I just pronounced it like Barry Silbert, but anyway, Bittensor, um, is is able to motivate at this time 10% of the GPU. So uh, Bit Tensor has 10% of the GPU between, I guess, Targon and Chutes that Elon has in his first data center. And this is when Bitensor is a tiny little baby shark. It's like not doing anything. It's like itty bitty. So nothing has happened yet, right? Imagine when it's a all grownup shark and it's really big. It should be able to be quite a bit bigger in terms of GPU than all of Elon's and anybody's server farm. Just like, just like Bitcoin is bigger than, you know, in aggregate the world's largest supercomputer by several orders of magnitude. It is the king of GPU. So yeah, right. You see what I'm saying? Like it would suggest that that's where this is headed.\nIt's it's a really great point. So, so I'm an investor in one uh storage uh storage company. They build data centers for other companies, and I just asked them randomly like a couple weeks ago, hey, are you doing anything with this Bit Tensor stuff? And he's like, funny you should ask. Uh, we're a, we're convincing our customers to be to be Bit Tensor miners by, you know, kind of leasing out their GPUs, their their spare cycles on their GPUs for, you know, TAO rewards. Uh, we're, we're, we're putting, uh, we're building Bitcoin ASIC chips to make it to to make the to optimize the GPUs that we're using to mine Bit Tensor, and we're selling these to our customers. So, so when storage companies like that are basically encouraging, you know, their, and their customers might be, you know, like Verizon, you know, with racks of of data centers out there or racks of servers. So, so when there, when when this is happening, that was very encouraging to me because the GPUs are going to get there. And then, but also there has to be the software too because, you know, there's other decentralized networks like Akos doing the GPU thing, but but like I like how Bit Tensor mixing mixes it up too with the software, but but that also seems to be happening. Like it, it does seem to be happening. Like it does feel like Bit Tensor now has reached the escape velocity that the internet had in let's in 1995 or Bitcoin had in 2013. It's just that it's just that nobody knows it yet. It's not escape velocity for consumers. It's it's, but it's the has the escape velocity that like it's harder now to figure out how this will fail than how it will succeed.\nYes, very well said. Completely agree.\nMy gut is everything, every molecule of my being is like, \"Oh my god, I've seen this like three or four times before.\" And and it doesn't happen that often, but this is like one of them things for sure. I\nI almost wish it was not a crypto token because it's different, you know, it's a, it's Decentralized AI, like Decentralized AI is what we are saying is going to happen. It just happens to be built on top of crypto technology, which we know works as a decentralized, you know, why reinvent the wheel? Bitcoin is the perfect decentralized currency, so here's TAO.\nRight, well, let's talk, let's talk about the subnets for a second because I want to, I'm just curious your view of, you know, we, we have these, each subnet, there's 128 of them. Each subnet has its own token, and that token is emitted into uh, the subnet's liquidity pool in the AMM on the chain. If you don't know what I just said, that just means that basically it's making more coins that are exchangeable for TAO within the Bit Tensor ecosystem. Right. So,\nyeah.\nRight. So, and we, we have this weird dynamic going on where the market caps of each one of these subnets are extremely low compared to their real-world counterparts, right? So, at one extreme we have Ready AI, which is basically um, um, oh, I'm spacing the name of the company. Um, Scale.\nYeah. Scale, sorry. Scale. No. Yeah. So, Ready AI subnet 33 is basically doing the equivalent that Scale AI is doing. Scale AI just got acquired by Facebook or Meta for 28 billion, whereas um, Ready AI, I believe their, their market cap last time I looked was about 10 million. So, you know, extreme difference there.\nWhen you say market cap though, are you talking about the value of their sub tokens?\nYes, I'm talking about the value of the circulating supply of the subnet tokens.\nI don't look at,\nwhich is not necessarily equity.\nNo, it's not equity. It's just they're just tokens, right? Subnet tokens. So there is one question, like, what are subnet tokens? Are they simply a memecoin for the subnet?\nYeah, I, we, we should discuss that. But so there's that. I'm just talking about the dynamic of the market caps are really low, but the emissions are really high, right? There's a lot of dilution going on because the chain, it's an early, it's a young, the chain is in a very young state right now in terms of the subnet tokens. So it's gushing a lot of, it's making a lot of new tokens every day, which is diluting all the holders, right? So there's that dynamic that's at play. Um,\nso we're in this. So anyway, so we're in this, that's the state of play right now. How do you view subnet token investing? Is it smart to get in early right now to the right subnets, or is it just dumb and you should just stay away? And what is a subnet token? How do you view that whole world?\nYeah, this is this is the critical question of subnets. And the answers to these questions, which we're not going to fully be able to answer here, but the answers to these questions are going to be what define the the the the future generations of successful subnets and and companies that are built on top of Bit Tensor. But the the issue is you're right, what is the value of a subnet token? If, for instance, it's not equity in the company. Like the market cap of Ready AI is not 10 million. That's just the market capitalization of their subnet token. It, it, it's just, it's just like with crypto tokens. Sometimes, you know, there are the subnet tokens or sometimes the crypto tokens in the in the crypto world reflect the profits and revenues of the underlying blockchain and protocol. And sometimes they don't. Sometimes it's a little bit BS, like Uniswap, which we know is one of the biggest DEX exchanges out there. They have a token, you and I, and people are often fooled into thinking you and I is somehow correlated to the growth of Uniswap. You and I has no extra, does not benefit at all from anything that happens on Uniswap. It's just a governance token. They get to vote on issues with Uniswap, but that vote is meaningless because there's\nI could say, I could say James, that Tesla, the stock, um, you, you basically, I mean, let's just assume you don't get dividends. I'm pretty sure you don't. You know, back in the 20s, right? Back when in Top Hat days, you own stocks because you're like, \"Well, Charles, look at my dividends that I got from this company, from the railroad, right? Like that's why you own stocks.\" And then at a certain point, like that became not a thing or a very small thing, and you just own stocks because you you thought that the price of the stock was going to go up, right? But what is a stock but a memecoin for a company?\nIt's true. Although there's, there's the mythology that Okay. So, so, so like using Ben Graham or Warren Buffett's view of a stock, a stock is worth the, you know, discounted value of all future cash flows. Uh, because eventually in some mythical future, those cash flows all get returned to the stockholders, whether it's because they got acquired or there's a dividend or or whatever. So, there's still that mythology that that exists that that's what a single share of stock is. It's it's worth, you know, the this discounted future cash flows of a company. And but with the with the tokens, and this applies to crypto as well, you have to do your due diligence, like what, how are the, how is the company behind the token, the subnet in this case, how are the subnets really incentivizing people to want to own their token? So, and I, I believe Shoots is an example. Every dollar of revenue they have is used for token buybacks, so that creat increases the value of the tokens you own. It's not a systematic thing. They don't have to do that. They've decided to do that. I think it's better if they systematically do it. But a little bit of the problem there is Shoots might have $10,000 a month in revenues, but half a million a month in emissions. So, it's still not enough to really incentivize. And by the, I don't know if those are the exact numbers. I'm making that up. Yes. But they, they, but it's roughly something like that. You know, they still have to come up with an incentive mechanism to make sure people are really incentivized to to to own those tokens. And I think there's not enough of an effort from these subnets at figuring out what the incent, maybe, maybe you attach equity to a token, but that's very difficult too then, and and I think because then you get into regulatory laws, and I, I don't think the Open Tensor Foundation is really encouraging of that, which I understand. So, you have to really think about what these incentives are and how they can be used. And I think that's still kind of just like, okay, I'll compare it to the web in the '90s. Again, we don't really know that if one day Uber is going to be on the web or Tik Tok or whatever, like that this is just going to happen in during the evolution of of this decentralized thing we're calling TAO or Bit Tensor.\nThat's going to be figured out by the by the most clever sub subnets. So, we don't really know the full answer yet. And and maybe right now there isn't one because it's so early. So, so miners are in there hoping that the incentives will be figured out, and the subnets are in there hoping that they're going to get more revenues, but they're still early stage startups, so it's not a requirement. And maybe they could figure out some way that, you know, like like AAVA is a crypto token that does lending. Well, just three or four months ago, they decided, okay, we're gonna, the profits from our lending, we're going to share with the token holders, and the A token shot up as a result. So, the same thing's going to happen with the subnets that figure out the right incentives. And I just, and you know, the problem is a little bit the in the the subnets, and this is a big argument I see on Twitter, you know, should people stake and root, should people stake with the subnets? The to stake with the subnets, you really have to do VC style due diligence. Are these subnets good companies or good services? And are they doing the right things for incentivizing miners? But then also because it reduces the importance of the root subnet, you got to, you still got to make sure people are incentivized to to own and stake TAO as well. So, you know, root APYs have been going down because more staking is happening in the subnets. I don't know the correct answer to this. There's some, you know, I think it'll just the free market will will figure it out, but it's it's an interesting dynamic right now for for subnets and for and for TAO.\nYeah. No, I obviously I agree, and I, I think that, I mean, I, I've heard you say that you think that some of these subnets will become multi-billion dollar companies.\nYes.\nAnd I, so yeah, so, so we agree there.\nYes. So,\nlike look, like look at like Ready AI. Of course, I don't want to use Scale if it's going to cost me an arm. Like Scale spends billions a year to do what they do. So, you know, Ready AI, the benefit of starting a company on Bit Tensor is that you have all these miners doing essentially for free work for you. They're doing it for the incentives you provide. But I would not, you know, if I'm a a young person in Oklahoma, I'm not going to be able to raise money from Silicon Valley VCs to start a 10 billion Scale. I've got to use a a decentralized network like Bit Tensor and TAO to start my company and build maybe even a better Scale because it's, you know, not to use the word Scale here, but subnets are infinitely scalable. They're not really dependent on how much money they've raised. They, they're, they're dependent on how they get excite miners and validators and then customers excited to do work for them. And so, so Ready could potentially be bigger than Scale.ai, and then are the subtokens worth it, or is it worth it to invest in the equity of Ready.ai? Like is that\n\n\nYou know, has that, is that an option? And so, these questions are still being worked out, but definitely, you know, companies like that, some of, some subset of them are going to be multi-billion dollar companies, and that's going to be a big tipping point for Bittensor.\n\nYeah, totally agree. And I think, I think, so you made an interesting point, which is, you know, if I'm, if I'm a small developer somewhere, um, I can't, I, I can't really afford scale.AI. It's expensive. Also, Meta owns them. So maybe I can't even get to them anymore, right? Because they're inside of Meta, right? Um, or I don't want them, I don't want to use them because I don't want them to know what I, I don't want Meta to know what I'm up to and steal my idea, right? So, um, so that, that's one problem. Uh, but number two, um, if I'm, if I'm a small developer, Bittensor right now can supply me with AI training, uh, for my AI project for 1/20th to 1/40th of the cost of the sort of mainstream competitors. Why? Because the chain itself is paying, is paying the developers that are running that AI commodity for me, right? So, yeah, right. Like, I don't, like the company Ready AI doesn't have to pay their people. The chain pays them. The chain pays them in tokens, right? And some people are like, \"Well, that's [ __ ]. You can't really, you know, how is that sustainable?\" Well, that's exactly what Bitcoin does. It's literally exactly what Bitcoin does. It pays the miners in Bitcoin, and that works stupendously well. So, there is some, so this model can work if the incentives are cooked correctly, right? So, now you've got this world where the AI training is 1/20th to 1/40th the cost, and the inference is about one sixth the cost. Oh my god, right? Like, it, it feels like, why, why isn't everyone using this? Well, it goes back to what you said earlier about Linux, uh, nobody has sort of wrapped this stuff in a corporate, you know, suit and tie, right? So, so everyone who, you know, so the big companies that would use this stuff at scale feel kind of, you know, they're kind of weirded out by the fact that, you know, it's this crypto, uh, freeish thing, right? Like, what's the catch? They don't like, there's something suspicious about it, right? But, but, but, but you're right, though. Okay, that suspicion happened with, with The Internet. That suspicion happened with Bitcoin. Um, and it's happening here with, with Bittensor. But let's, like, think of a real-world use case. Now, I've never used Ready AI, AI, so, or Ready AI. So, tell me if I'm, if this use case is incorrect for that subnet. But, um, let's say I have a bunch of doctors, and I've got a million patient records, but, you know, meaning a patient comes in, complains to me, and I write down their complaints with my handwriting, and then I make a diagnosis, and that diagnosis either turns out to be correct or incorrect. So, this is the data I have, but it's written in notes of different handwritings, and it's, you know, different pharmaceutical data, whatever it is. Now, I want to do, I want to make an AI model that, given a new patient, I look at my million patient records already, and the AI has that, has trained on them, is able to tell me a diagnosis for the new patient. So, maybe I go to a Ready AI and say, \"Hey, make this structured data.\" And then I'll go to, uh, gradients, and I'll say, \"Here's structured data, you know, make an AI model.\" And now I'm in business. I have a business, uh, giving medical diagnosis for, for AI. These are like enormously powerful, you know, if that's truly how these subnets are working. And if it's not them, I'm sure there's some subnets doing them, but that's truly powerful. If I can develop an, an AI company, you know, based on using these subnets of Bittensor that are also kind of like companies, I think you, Bittensor has a, a trillion dollar value. I mean, it flips Bitcoin even.\n\nYeah. No, I, what you just described is, is in fact correct. So, yes. And if, and if the, the world at large sort of catches on to the fact that, um, it can basically compose these subnets into, like, you know, you know, just like DeFi Lego bricks snap together to make bigger things, so too do the Bittensor subnets snap together to make bigger things, just like what you just, like your example. Um, once, once the world sort of catches on to that at scale, I, I do think that the, the horse runs out of the barn at, like, you know, warp eight, maybe warp nine.\n\nYes, I, I agree. Particularly, like, so, so let's take my example again. So, it's a bunch of doctors who have a million patient records, and they don't want to spend a million dollars on servers and networking and software developers, and, oh, and by the way, let's use scale.ai to, to structure our data. It would cost them millions of dollars to really put this together. Plus, they'd have to know what to do. They'd have to, like, hire software people in advance of hiring other software people to help them even just plan the business. But with Bittensor, I don't, I don't even think it's 1/20th or 1/40th. I think it's like 1/100th or 1/200th the price, and, and, and in just a matter of weeks as opposed to, you know, planning for months for, for a bunch of doctors to do what I described doing. That is such an enormous benefit. And you figure that, okay, Scale got bought for 28 billion. Open AI is worth like a couple hundred billion now. I don't, I don't even know. So, those are like the two companies I'd have to start off with, you know, in addition to, to hosting my stuff on some servers and everything. So, so, so Bittensor can do this with companies valued combined less than, you know, 50 million or 100 million. So, the, the fact that Bittensor is only quote unquote worth three or four billion is just ridiculous at this point. Like, I think that's why we could easily see $5,000, $10,000, uh, you know, per TAO token, you know, shortly after the having. The having is happening on December 10th of this year.\n\nYeah. But after the, after the having, I mean, something like 80 to 90% of, of Bittensor or TAO is, is staked already. So, people are already long-term holders. There's hardly any TAO for sale, and, uh, and I know this, having been in the market every day the past month or so. Uh, you know, imagine after the having, where the, the amount for that of supply that's for sale each day is going to get cut in half, but the demand is going to go up because the more subnets there are, the, the subnets demand TAO every single day. So, the demand's going to go up, supply is going to go down, just basic economics, the TAO token is going to skyrocket. On top of the fact that if we manage to hit one of these tipping points, like someone makes a business and says, \"Oh, this is a billion dollar business because of TAO, or a hundred million business because of TAO, it's just, it's just game over.\" Like, it's 5,000, 10,000, $20,000 TAO. And I'm not trying to shill TAO. It's $200 million volume a day. I'm, there's nothing that you and I can say that are going to make the price of TAO go up or down.\n\nYeah. But that's just what's going to happen.\n\nYeah, I agree with you. And it does feel, it does feel like, it does feel like the very early days of Bitcoin. I mean, I just, we keep coming back to that. But it's, I remember Bitcoin bobbled around, like, you know, between 200 and $400, you know, zipping up to like 600 or 650, maybe 700, and then back down again because it got scared. Um, and it did that for, like, I, I seem to remember, like, a couple years, and then all of a sudden, it just went up to, like, you know, 1,200. Then it sort of bobbled around there for a little while, and then it went to 5,000, and then 10,000, like, it, like, those, those hops happened pretty fast afterwards, and, and, and it sort of shocked everyone that sort of wasn't believing in it. And the difference now is that, um, Bitcoin did not have all those rails built for new money to come in, or at least they, they were, they were booting up and booting up slowly, like Coinbase and, you know, Binance and all, all the things that we know now were pretty new and just coming into being. Previous to that, there was like Mount Gox, right? That was kind of it, right? And, you know, and some, some corner store guys. Um, but, you know, here in the future, we have the advantage of a very robust crypto ecosystem. So, those price jumps theoretically can happen a lot faster than they did for Bitcoin. So, I, I think, yeah, and also, don't forget, for Bitcoin, you, if you were a miner, you had to sell the next day because you had to pay your electricity bills. So, and to this day, that's still true. But a Bittensor miner doesn't have to sell. So, not only is the supply being cut, but there might actually, because there's going to be more demand, there might be more reason to hold on to your Bittensor. So, the supply is going to just be, the supply for sale each day is just going to be drastically cut as, as demand slows, and you don't need a lot of demand. You just need a demand to slowly go up, and it's going to have an astronomical effect on, on the price. Right now, I think most of the volume in Bittensor, to be honest, is hedge funds with algorithms, because I mean, you have $200 million volume, that, that's not real volume. That's, you know, okay, Bittensor is so volatile. If you have some algorithmic approach to trading it, you're going to trade that with $200 million. So, it's that, that's a lot of the, a lot of the trading already on, on Bittensor. It's not like real trading. So, so an uptick in demand is just going to drastically affect price. There's another dynamic at play here besides the, the normal Bitcoin one, right? Where there's, you know, 21 million coins total, blah, blah, blah, blah. Unlike Bitcoin, where there was no use for it within the Bitcoin network, TAO is used frequently inside of the Bittensor network. You need TAO. You need to stake TAO in order to get subnet tokens, right? So, in, in, in a sense, subnet tokens are just rehypothecated TAO, right? And if, and if the subnet does well, the, the value is always driven back into the root token. In order to create a new subnet, you need to stake some TAO. In order to be a validator, you need to stake TAO. In order to be a miner, I think you have to register with some TAO, right? So, there's use cases. There's Ethereum-like use cases inside of the Bittensor network. But at each point, you're staking TAO in order to do something, which means you're bricking it and making it, you know, not go anywhere. And that's a dynamic that did not exist in Bitcoin. So, oh my god, right, is what I, and, and even using the subnets as a customer, you have to pay in TAO. Now, I wish there was kind of a fiat front end to that. So, I'm not aware, really, that I, some of these things do have those, that, by the way, there are, and they're starting to boot up the fiat front ends. I think Hippius, the, the kind of Filecoin competitor, I forgot which subnet it is. I think they're doing a, a fiat front end. Um, Targon's got one, too, I think. Uh, ah, as well. That's important. Yeah. As well as I know that Shoots does now, too, but the, the, the fiat front ends are actually pretty new. Like, about three weeks ago, three, four weeks ago, there, there weren't any. So, right. And, and that's, that's going to happen. It's going to evolve fast. And then at some point, the, the, the investor community, which right now overlaps a little bit with the developer community, but at some point, the investor community is going to realize, oh, this is real. This is something that's going to affect, impact the real world. It's not just this project. And, and already we know it's not a project. There's 128 subnets performing valuable services. But people are going to, it's going to be this realization all of a sudden that's just going to, I mean, we saw just in the past week, the price went from 300 to up to 450. Now it's around 410 or 412 or whatever. It's a very volatile crypto, but the next step is certainly a jump to a thousand. Okay, I can easily foresee that happening very quickly, you know, particularly in the, there's going to be, it's going to move up in the run-up to the having, and then after the having, it's just going to spike. Just the tokconomics are going to be ridiculous.\n\nYeah, I agreed. Well, let me ask you kind of a crazy question now, and then I'll let you go because we're coming up on the hour. But before we go, um, so inside of the, the crypto universe, we saw Ethereum boot up, right? We, we saw Bitcoin came along, and then there was a bunch of Bitcoin clones, and most of them kind of didn't go anywhere. There's Dogecoin and Litecoin, but that's kind of it.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, and then Ethereum came along, and that presented like a new kind of crypto, and we saw lots of things spring up around that, attempting to sort of steal the thunder from Ethereum, right? Um, one of the more successful attempts at that was Solana, and Solana was a VC coin, you know, obviously, you know, famously, like, something like 30 or 40% of it was like owned immediately, um, by venture capitalists who booted that up, right? So, the VC world saw Ethereum and said, hey, let's, let's go make our own one of those, right? And we'll, and then one we can own this time, right? And, you know, do you think, so my question is this, Bittensor appears to have created another class of coin and ecosystem. If I was a VC, I'd be looking at that going, hey, I like that TAO stuff, let's go make ourselves one of them. Let's do like a Solana of TAO. How likely do you think it is that, um, a well-healed VC, an A16Z or somebody like that, could do that?\n\nThe, the problem is, unlike a lot of those other projects you mentioned, uh, including Ethereum and Solana, Ethereum is almost a special case now after being around for 10 years. But, you know, TAO has a moat around it. Like, yes, it's easy. It might be easy to make another TAO 2, you know, TAreum, whatever.\n\n\nYou want to call it.\nBut, uh, you, but look, there's 128 subnets and then a waiting list of people who want to build on top of Bittensor.\nYou can't just hire people like Bittensor is not just the token.\nBittensor is the network.\nIt's got a network effect.\nYou know, Salana and these other, okay, let's say I'm BlackRock, the the big financial institution, and I want to start tokenizing real estate.\nOkay, well, I can use Salana, but maybe I could also use Avalanche or I can use Hideera.\nYou know, there's all these layer ones that have similar functionality with small changes.\nI could use any of them.\nThere's not really a moat protecting, there's tiny moats depending on per token.\nBut Bittensor has this network effect.\nWhat if I told you, \"Hey, Mark, for $10,000, I'll sell you a complete clone of Facebook.\nYou can make another Facebook and Facebook's worth $2 trillion.\"\nYou would say, \"No, it's not worth $10,000 because the clone has no value.\nIt's the network that had the value.\nIt's the Moors law and and not only that, u and metaf's law, sorry, and not only that, Bittensor is a network of networks.\nSo every subnet has, you know, subsets and and and has its own ecosystem.\nSo that there's something called Reed's law, which is like an exponential version of of metaf's law.\nMaybe I even saw someone talking on your podcast about this.\nI'm not sure you did.\nSo yeah.\nSo, I forgot who was it who was who was talking about this, but Mike Grantis.\nMike Grantis.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, I'm just repeating what's already been said on that I learned on your podcast.\nSo, give full credit to where it's due, but I believe it like that's that is a huge mode that is you, I don't know how you would create another, uh, you can't create a duplicate bider because how are you going to get the network?\nHow are you going to get the 128 subnets and and all the people who are already using those subnets?\nYou know, there are customers now who depend on shoots and who depend on gradients and and these other, uh, and you know, and ready AI and so on.\nYeah, I, it's achieved enough scale that's got escape velocity.\nI agree with you on that.\nAnd I think also it was born correctly, right?\nSo Salana was sort of born dirty and everyone kind of knows it.\nAnd and by the way, Salana hired a head of marketing.\nYou know, they they took what Netflix's head of marketing and made their own head of marketing.\nAnd and I give them full credit that this this woman started hackathons, Salana hackathons, and started sponsoring things.\nBittensor or the Open Tensor Foundation doesn't want to do that because they really believe in the decentralized ethos.\nBut again, some front-end person in the ecosystem will do that.\nMaybe me, you know, like I'm you know, someone like me will do that and and that will work.\nYeah.\nWell, they definitely need some help and I I'm I'm glad I'm I'm putting my shoulder at the wheel, too.\nI'm I'm with you.\nI'm a I'm a true believer.\nSo, I'm uh I'm I'm here I'm here for the long haul as well.\nSo, James, this has been an awesome hour.\nIt's always like super fun to talk to you.\nUm, yeah, thank you, Mark.\nSame here.\nLike, let's let's do it again.\nLike, I always learn from our conversations.\nYou have so much knowledge that it's and I always listen to the podcast that that's why I'm just I got to be careful when I come on here not to just repeat what I heard before on here.\nNo, dude.\nThis was great.\nThis is this was like 90% new stuff to me.\nSo, so thank you once again, James.\nMy name is Mark Jeffrey.\nThis has been Hash Rate.\nWe'll see you all next time.\n",
