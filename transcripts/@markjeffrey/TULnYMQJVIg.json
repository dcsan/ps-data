  "cleanText": "Hello everybody and welcome to Hash Rate. My name is Mark Jeffrey. I have three guests today from Gaia. First one is Gabriel Moraga, Noah Kramer, and Steven Hristopoulos. Hello gentlemen. Welcome to the show. Hello.\n\nI did not know that all of Gaia was going to be here today. The entire planet has arrived for the show, but I'm happy because we have more voices. So, it's always a better show.\n\nThis is only part of our team. We have uh at least two other guys that are shifting to full-time work on Gaia, but uh we figured that since we'd all have been on it since the start that we'd be the best people to talk about it and also not to crowd the podcast too much. Yeah. No, I appreciate that. I mean, three guests is about all usually it can handle, right? So, other than that, it just becomes madness, right? So, yeah. Okay. So, let's jump right into what you guys are doing. So Gaia is uh I I think it's a Weather Patterns prediction Subnet and so why don't why don't you guys tell me what what are you guys trying to accomplish with Gaia?\n\nSure. Um so I can kind of like start off with that. So Gaia was initially envisioned not only as a Weather Patterns prediction Subnet. Uh it was envisioned to be covering a lot of different Geospatial AI tasks. So after I came out of school and I I did a little bit of research in the Geospatial AI space, um I was kind of noticing that it seemed to be like there was uh just as much advancement happening in Geospatial AI but uh not as much commercialization. So it felt like a really good area to tackle. And there are so many different applications um in the Geospatial AI space with with these kinds of AI Models. When you say geospatial, do you mean like like mapping in general? Like what does that mean? Yeah. So really just like any sort of geollocated data? Um you could think of weather is a great example obviously because these data points are are you know located to a latitude and a longitude and also like in the atmosphere 3D space they're also located at a pressure level. uh but geospatial covers a very wide range of things. So another one of our tasks is soil moisture prediction which is related to weather and then uh the other one is uh geomagnetic which is is more a space thing than an earth thing but um yeah like the geomagnetic DST index basically what is that so is that like like where the earth's magnetic field is where you know the aurora borealis is going to maybe show up or something like that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Exactly. Do you want to talk about that, Gabriel? Yeah. So, DST is basically incoming, you know, um, basically radiation from the sun and it hits our atmosphere and yeah, it does create aurora borealis. Oh, so like space weather is what we're talking about. It's like the Carrington event, right? Like that's actually one of my a lot of people don't know about this. So like in the 1800s, like like 1850 or something, there was a massive coronal mass ejection from the sun. Like we've never seen in our lifetime. Yeah. And and it fried the telegraph wires. They caught on fire. And And people say like if that happened today, it would fry like every cell phone. There's like everything would just be destroyed. Yeah. It would be really bad. So keep our fingers crossed. Yeah. So So knowing about that is very good, right? Like we definitely want to know if that thing's coming, right? Although even if you had, you know, 45 minutes warning, it's Yeah. It's not going to do much. Yeah. But I have got like Faraday bags and stuff so like I'm good. Oh yeah, that helps definitely. Yeah. Anyway, so please continue. Please tell us more about that. Okay. So yeah, I'll um so that was the initial vision was that Bittensor provides this kind of unique uh platform with with the incentives and and the distributed nature of it to tackle these sorts of tasks which are really well suited for Geospatial AI machine learning because usually these models are are are pretty small relatively. So they're not it's not like a 500 billion parameter large language model which takes a a huge computer to run. It's it's more so like uh models that could be run on a laptop so or or just like a single GPU. So it's really well suited to Bittensor and there is also a lot of application um commercially speaking. So weather is why we're focusing on weather is that that is going to be the kind of data that is most uh valuable immediately like we can just turn around and and sell that right away. Um, the other Let me let me ask you a question about that because I I sort of, you know, when I first heard about you guys and the fact that this that weather in Bittensor was even a thing, my first thought was like, dude, we we've got the weather. Like, just go to weather.com or Yahoo or something, right? Like, we got it. Like, why why is why why do we need you guys? Isn't that good enough? Like, what's what's the scoop there? Yeah, do you want to take this one? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, it's a good question. I think there's a few different reasons. Um, one natural one is that AI Models are starting to be within the past two years are starting to be pretty promising in terms of like accuracy and skillfulness of the forecast compared to big like simulationbased forecast systems that something like the National Weather Service will implement. Yeah. Um, and you know, the benefit that I guess our Subnet, our weather task has is that the National Weather Service, I think, spends on the order of $50 million a year to produce the global forecast system. And each model run, if you want to produce like a 10-day forecast, will take several hours of runtime and pedlops of compute. Whereas these AI Models can run on a single GPU, they can make a full 10day forecast in like less than 10 minutes. Holy $2 max. Oh wow. Okay. So like orders of magnitude, less compute, and the accuracy is relatively the same, or is it better? It it can be much better. Um there there's a few different models. We're using Microsoft Aurora, which is probably the newest AI Model, and its accuracy is easily better than the GFS forecast at, you know, 3 days, 5 days range. It's comparable to HRES, which is the European um high resolution forecast, which seems to be like the the gold standard state-of-the-art benchmark to beat. So, it's very very competitive. Wow. So, and so Microsoft Cobalt, so is that like So, Microsoft basically is this is an LLMish uh AI Weather prediction model that's open source that anyone can download. Is that correct? Yeah, it's it's fully licensed under MIT. It is similar to an LLM where it's transformer based. Um, and they they provide a foundational atmospheric model that's tuned over, you know, a million GPU hours. And, you know, the weights are MIT licensed. The code is open source. It's PyTorch. Uh, it's super flexible. So, you can extend it to something like hurricanes or or, you know, particle diffusion like if you want to track ash from volcanoes to pollution. It's it's very flexible which is why we went for it. Wow. Okay. So now you said that this is the model. This is the this is this is the software you use. By that you mean um you have a a network of miners that are all competing for the Root Emissions, right? So all of the miners are required to download and install Aurora on their on their end and then com and then basically tweak it in various ways to like how do I win, right? right? If everybody's running the same thing, doesn't everybody have the same result? Like tell me tell me a little bit about that. How do I win your contest? Right. That's a good question. Yeah. So, Aurora is the the base model that we provide every minor and they can use the existing weights that Microsoft provides, but we're trying to build a scoring system in such a way that it incentivizes miners to fine-tune their models and to specialize. So maybe one minor you know will specialize in subtropical like temperature prediction and someone else will specialize in you know extratropic winds and stuff like that. So you know the validator's role is really picking out and determining which minor is the best and it is a competition here. Yeah. Yeah. So is each does everybody get the same data to crunch or do you sort of take like you know okay you you take the Bahamas you person you take Scotland like how is it sort of chopped up or versus or is everybody doing the whole world? It it's fully global. It'll it's at a quarter degree resolution which I think is around 20 kilometers like per pixel in size. Yeah it's fully global. Um no seams. It's, you know, nine different variables from things like temperatures to winds to pressures, humidity, um, and then a bunch of different pressure levels, which is like the heights above ground. So, every minor gets a standardized input of GFS data. They'll get current data, and then their task is to run the model and produce a full 10day forecast. And that forecast is produced at six-hour steps. Wow. Okay. And then, um, it's pretty big. Yeah. No, it's pretty wild. I mean, I'm trying to figure out like how this actually works under the hood, right? Because uh like LLMs are something. They're just autocompletes, right? Like, and they run on stats. It's almost like a Ouija board that runs on stats and somehow it produces something which appears to be able to reason and talk to us and pass the touring test, right? Like, and and nobody really knows why or how, right? Like, it's it's sort of weird, right? And so, um and so I'm I'm trying to figure out like how does this apply to weather? Like, how does it predict? Does it just notice connections between things that people can't see because our brains are too little? Like, you know, if a if a butterfly flaps its wings over here, like a hurricane will happen over there in 3 days. Like, is it like that? Like, do do we know anything about how it's produc how it's how is it figuring out what the weather's going to be? That's what I'm Do we know? Yeah. I think I think you're pretty on on point with like that it it's more so recognizing patterns between like a a given state and then like what it thinks the future state will be. So you know I think existing forecasts start with like fluid dynamic equations and physics equations. Yeah. And they'll iterate which is why they cost so much to run because you just need so much compute power. But the power of using like a transformer-based model like this is that the model can learn very well. like if you give it two different time steps, it can learn, okay, here's how the atmosphere will change over six hours. So that's really all the model's doing. It doesn't have any inherent like bakedin understanding of physics. It learns patterns and from that it it can understand like atmospheric dynamics very well. Like it it can track cyclones fairly reliably. If you look at something like, you know, a wind field, if you step it over all the 10day, all the six-h hour steps in the 10-day forecast, it'll look fluid. It'll make sense like there's no discreet random jumps. Like it it does seem very physically like intuitive.\n\nYeah. So, No, you were going to say something. Oh, I was just going to say I love that you mentioned the butterfly effect. Um, I think that the it's similar to LLMs in that there is somewhat of a black box going on there. The the prediction patterns are are all learned and each layer in the model is going to have a different loss function, but at the end of the day, it's essentially just it it is recognizing patterns from old data. And that old data is all constructed through years and years of weather research and numerical prediction. So it's not like this would have been possible without all of that. And I think that is an important important point to make is that those numerical um traditional weather models are are kind of the foundation of what we're able to achieve now. Okay. So the old way of doing it or the the current way of doing it maybe um it's sort of like it's very deliberate. It's it's like a physics professor, you know, well, I'm going to calculate the the en vector of the this or the that and it's very sort of like equations and he's got a big whiteboard and it and it and it takes like forever to crunch this data in this very deliberate, very planned out, very mathematical way and then along come you guys and your thing and this Microsoft uh you know LLMish model and it kind of vibes into it. It's like yeah, I just kind of kind of feels like this is what's going to happen if that happens, right? almost is what it feels like, right? But but it arrives at the same place or a better place, which I I I'm still just like I I know that it works, but it's still hard to sort of wrap your head around that it actually works, right? So, um so when you guys run your contest, what are you benchmarking against? Do you then uh score based on what actually happened or do you score against another, you know, this other traditional model and like what it predicts? What what's sort of what's the judge if you will, right? That's a good question. Yeah, we actually do both. So the caveat here is that actual ground truth data has like a on average 5day delay. So you have to wait 5 days and then hind cast validate the minor's predictions. Wow. But you know, we always want to give miners like immediate feedback on how they're doing. So after they run their forecast, they're compared against the National Weather Surface's GFS forecast. So we compare how's the miners forecast against compared to this existing fairly state-of-the-art forecast and then we compare both to like a historical climatology which is like an averagely a weekly or monthly mean of like what's the average temperature what's the average wind speed etc. Um so you know day one we can do initial like quality control and give them an initial scoring metric saying oh you're maybe you know x% better than the existing forecast but then come five plus days later. You can actually score on real ground truth like the gold standard which is era 5 and definitively say you know you are x amount more accurate or you know you are x amount less accurate. Wow. Okay. So that's that's pretty wild. So either way, there's incentive throughout the whole scoring process.\n\n\nRight? Yes. Yeah.\nYep. No, I like that you guys are doing both. That's pretty interesting.\nUm, okay, so now you guys, you know, you're obviously trying to create a product to sell to the world. Like that's the end goal here, right? It's not just to provide weather for free. It's like we want to provide weather to um, you know, the crop people. I'm not sure who buys it, but like I'm just thinking like, you know, the all I can think of is in Trading Places where they have the orange the orange forecast, right? Where they know what the orange futures are going to be. I don't know if you guys have seen that movie, but but like weather plays a big part like knowing what the weather is. You know, whether the oranges are going to freeze or not ahead of time, right? If you can see into the future. Um, so who are we selling this data to first of all? Who are we selling this data to? And how do you compete against the people who's selling the weather data right now and and who will you sell it to in the future and how big is that market, I guess, is what I'm asking. Sure.\nSo it's kind of hard to quantify the total market size. Um, there like as you said, there are so many industries that have a use for this data. So, in all of our market research, it's been kind of hard to figure out like the total addressable market um for specifically for weather API products. So, something like that, that'll be our first product. It's just like here's the forecast, here's here's the raw data um and it'll be API accessible. That's a $4 billion market and growing at a rate of about 7 to 10% um over the next 10 years. 7 to 10% annually. Um, so it's it's a good market to get into because it's like it's pretty niche, but it's also like still significant and a lot of those major players in that market are very well-established and therefore ripe for disruption. They um are legacy companies. So, I'm sure you've heard of Acueeather, but then there are other um companies like Open Weather, uh Mediomatics. Um, so, there aren't a ton of companies in this space, but the ones that do exist are kind of just repackaging products from uh government like forecasting centers and and then putting their own secret sauce on top of it sometimes. So the space itself is very ripe for disruption. Um, I know that a lot of these other companies are already starting to incorporate this machine learning type forecasting into their products. I think that where we have the advantage is one the competitive element to to be fine-tuning this model or or models into like more accuracy in specific regions or um variables. So, so we kind of have this like, you know, head start because we don't have to necessarily put the resources in as a company to do all of that specialization ourselves. Uh, we just kind of get that from the natural incentive structure and then we can combine all of those products at the end. So, say, you know, 10 miners are really good at the tropics and 10 miners are really good at mountainous regions. We can combine all of those forecasts into an ensemble forecast, which is kind of just like an average in a way, but uh it can get a lot more complicated than that. And that ensemble could be more accurate than any one forecast, especially when we're having so much specialization in different areas. Yeah, I don't think Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.\nYeah, I was just going to wrap it up and say though that so we have a $4 billion uh market for weather API products, the the greater market for like all weather and climate related data services, things like that is closer to 20. Then uh weather apps are kind of their own little niche and that's another $4 billion market. And that's kind of not even scratching the surface of all the other industries that might use weather data like agriculture and and finance, hedge funds or or energy. Um, so it's it's a pretty big space to get into.\nYeah. I mean, feels like weather's weather's a big deal. Everybody's got to know what the weather is, right? It's it's multiple dimensions, right? So, yeah. So, it sounds like, you know, add up everything you said, it's, you know, it's at least a 30 or $40 billion uh industry. And I happen to know when Uber started the worldwide black car market was 42 billion. So you're sort of looking at a market which is roughly equivalent to Uber which is pretty enormous, right? So uh Uber became Uber off of a market of that size, right? So if you can undercut and it sounds like your competition is all dumb and old, right? Kind of like Ubers was there a bunch of taxis, right? Um, it sounds like I mean I don't know for sure, but it sounds, you know, if I look if I looked under the hood at Acue, I bet I'd find, you know, ganky old forran from, you know, 1961 or something, uh, you know, you know, you know, or cobalt or you know, running on TR80s, right? Like they've never been changed, almost like the Swift system is all ganky and old like that, right? So um, so you have your new fangled model, you can charge a lot less for it and because you have the big world out there of miners, you know, sort of this Linux-like effect of weather forecasting, you know, all these people specializing in little niches so they can earn the rewards from the uh the tow emissions, you know, from the from the nut, you know, when it emits $TAO and subnet tokens. Um, it sounds like you can you're far more maneuverable than the incumbents and uh and also you can charge less because you yourselves are subsidized by the tow blockchain. It's doing what it does, right? It's it's subsidizing what you're doing. So, you can charge because of that, you can charge less to whoever these customers are. Did I characterize that correctly? Anything you want to add to that? Yeah, absolutely. I think that's a great summary. Um, I just want to add that I think I I don't want to say they're they may be old, but I don't want to call meteorologists dumb. Um, like they they're all very aware of of the advancements in these models. I would say these companies are definitely um attacking this new paradigm, but they are much slower. They're less limber than we are. And they they are plagued by the same thing that any longstanding industry giant is is plagued with. I mean, Acue is claiming they're the most accurate hurricane forecaster in the world. And then the study that confirmed that was paid for by them and it it made some claims that were not super supported by science. So, uh, the the meteorology community was a bit up in arms about that one. Um, but yeah, in general, I think that the market is ripe for disruption and these models are not quite commercialized yet. Um, so there's a and they're all open source. So there's a big opportunity to to commercialize them and uh drive this whole space forward. Okay.\nWell, let me ask you a question. Sort of more of a Bittensor Towide question and subnet tokenwide uh question. A lot of debate about this particular topic as of late. Um, so the way the the the $TAO emissions are are are, you know, they're basically driving a lot of subnet token prices down uh because there's there's new subnet tokens being minted every day and sort of flooding into the liquidity pools and it's not being at the moment it's not being offset by buy pressure. Um, there's lots of theories on this um, you know, from people buying, you know, sub new subnet tokens that even if they like the subnets are sort of staying out. Only 7% of $TAO has entered into the subnet token universe. So that means 93% of $TAO is sitting on the sideline just sort of watching going, &quot;Yeah, I don't know. I'm not going to get into subnet tokens yet.&quot; Um, and outside money is not yet coming in in droves into the $TAO ecosystem the way it might flood in if this whole thing were say in Solana or Ethereum or some other ecosystem where there's already a ton of liquidity, right? It's kind of kind of hard to get into the tow universe and that's this is then also exacerbated by the fact that you guys are paying yourselves, I'm assuming, um, by selling your own subnet tokens and and $TAO, right? So there's sell pressure from you depressing the price of the GAIA Subnet token. Um, this allows you to sell your product at a lower price because of the subsidy, which is true for every sub, it's just not you guys, right? Obviously, shoots is doing the same thing. Um, how do you feel about that and what do you think about that dynamic? Do you think that that will correct over time? How do you view that? Um, and what are you doing to mitigate against it if anything? That's a great question. Um, Gabby, did you want to say something? Yeah, just I know so Noah is kind of the the expert in detail here, but I do want to just say that um, you know, the GAIA community, I think they it's very understanding and miners know their role and they know if we look at this as a company that they own half or 40% of the company and so we rely on them and they rely on us. So, we listen to our community very well and I think that gives us that puts us in a really good position in the detail world um because we're super active on Discord and communicating and all of that. And um, you know, I I think we should be in the top 10. I think that's like like we're awesome. We're weather and I really do think that GAIA has what it takes. Um, but in terms of like the actual politics of detail, I think Noah has a more indepth um knowledge of that.\nSo I can I can go over that a little bit. So we as nickel 5, we've been in Bittensor um since 2013. I mean 2023, my bad. Uh, off by a decade.\nUm, so anyway, um, I I was hired a little over a year ago and we so we started building our first subnets uh before DTA and in that time I think it was more of sort of like an incubator type environment where it was safer to be a pre-revenue company and now post detail I I would say the best metaphor is that it's like forcing yourself to go public before you even have a product. And so that's super tricky because now you're answering to all sorts of investors that don't have like a longer term vision. Um, you get, you know, spikes in price on pure hype and then huge dumps right after. So it's it's a really tricky environment to organize a company around in terms of relying on it for your only source of income. Thankfully, because we started before DTA, we've actually kind of just been coasting on our pre- DTA earnings. Um, and we haven't sold any of our alpha token yet. So, we will have to do that soon. But, uh, we're trying to just hold off as long as we can until we have uh a more sustainable plan for how we'll do that without causing a a price death spiral. But it is hard because we have this constant sell pressure from miners, from validators and then just the the inflows are basically just hype uh at at the current moment or maybe 90% hype and 10% like true true believers who are willing to sit through a lot of volatility to see something through. So, it is um it is a tricky environment and that's why we're like really focused on a product that can bring us revenue as soon as possible because once we have that revenue flowing, we can use that to cover our business expenses and we can also bring more buy pressure uh just through buybacks. So, that's really our main priority. But, yeah, I'm not going to lie, it's been really hard for us. uh we we have felt like the pressure from the way things are designed is not conducive to to a startup type company. Um, that's why I think shoots is doing so well for instance because it was very easy for them to just go around and get revenue because they're selling a a product that already exists basically like pure compute. It's not like it took them months of R&amp;D to pull that together. Um, they have really good infrastructure, but it's they're just repackaging something that already exists essentially. And we are too, but it did take us a little more R&amp;D to get there. Yeah, I'd say Tahash is doing this is one of those as well that just repackaging something or you know, obviously produces it produces Bitcoin. So, you know, it produces revenue, right? Like right away. Shoot, same thing, right? Like they're selling compute and it's subsidized by their emissions, but you know they're they're basically reselling something. It's very easy. So whereas you guys to make a sale, so how do you guys make a sale? Like do you have to bisdev your way into a sale or do you just sort of put up a swipe a credit card, get a uh you know get a get a forecast? Like how does that work? Yeah, so we're going to do both. Basically, uh we'll have an API service that you know like any sort of online subscription model. There will be a couple different tiers um depending on how much data you want, how quickly you want it, like bandwidth limitations. And then we'll have sort of an enterprise tier which will be a bit more customizable. It'll be contract based so we'll require them to sign a year contract. And then with those two avenues, uh I think most of our sales will go to businesses eventually. So I think the um first part is get the product ready and the infrastructure and that's what we're prioritizing right now. We have the data coming in. So now we just need to package it for sale. And then once we're ready to do that, then we will turn on the the sales engine, hire some salespeople and and really try to do some like B2B outreach um and get some contracts signed or just have people sign up for like a monthly if if they don't need the full enterprise plan. And how far away are you from making sales, do you think? Um, well, the infrastructure will be ready in I would say about a month. Um, and then so once that's up, it it could be any day after that. It could be a while after that. Just kind of depends on how well we market it. Um, and how good our sales team is. We have some decent contacts uh, in terms of like people who are very experienced with B2B tech sales. So, we'll definitely be reaching out to them to kind of uh construct a a sales strategy and and just revamp our our marketing. We kind of have to divide how we market because right now pretty much we're just marketing to Bittensor and maybe crypto in general. And then once we're ready with the product, then we kind of have to split\n\n\nAnd say, \"Here's what we have, but don't worry about any of what's going on under the hood other than like decentralized AI and like, you know, cheaper.\"\nAnd then on the other side, we still have like miners, validators, uh, you know, Bittensor investors, people like that.\nYeah.\nSo, uh, and by the way, I'm just going to say something.\nI hold your token.\nIt's one of the subnets I hold.\nI've held it for a while.\nSo, I just find, you know, looking through the list of subnets, I was like, \"This one looks very interesting.\nI like the fact that it was weather.\nI think there's too few subnets that have a natural obvious customer.\"\nAnd yes, it's harder for you to get to your customer, but there is one and there is an addressable market.\nAnd, you know, everybody needs to know what the weather report is.\nIt's, you know, it's a need.\nIt's not aspirin, it's oxygen, right?\nPeople need this product, right?\nAnd um so I to me it was one of the few that was very obvious to buy the subnet token of and you know like you I'm like come on do something.\nIt's not going fast enough, right?\nLike it's always frustrating when like your guy isn't moving as fast as you hoped he would.\nBut I had faith the entire time.\nI'm like something's going to happen here.\nIt will, it's going to, they're going to achieve fusion at some point.\nIt's just we're not quite there yet.\nLike the plutonium and the uranium are still in the squeezing together and it hasn't quite ignited yet, but it's going to, right?\nSo, that's how I felt about it.\nWell, we really appreciate your support.\nThat's awesome.\nAnd and yeah, we feel like we're making a lot of progress towards that fusion point.\nWe've, I mean, Steven did a lot of the research.\nI would say my end is more just like architecture overall subnet design.\nUh, but Steven, I'm gonna give him credit for, I would say, 90% of all the heavy lifting for the weather research that it took to get this task to come together.\nUm, and we think we're pretty close to that fusion point of here's our product.\nIt's online.\nAnybody can get it.\nAnd we're going to start to make sales and uh bring in some real revenue and become not just a Bittensor company but a real one too, you know, funded by Bittensor.\nSo yes, incubated by Bittensor.\nYeah, exactly.\nYeah.\nAbsolutely.\nI mean, just general question about the way this process should work and I'm, I think none of us totally know yet.\nWhat is the, what do you think the recipe is for a successful subnet?\nThere there's like some competing thesis out there, right?\nSo at one end of the spectrum there's the theory that like, well, this is, you know, Bittensor and $TAO is like PBS, we fund these projects and they don't ever have to make revenue.\nUh, they're just subsidized by the blockchain, right?\nIt's this Bitcoin-like libertarian, you know, universe where it's just subsidized by an ever-growing $TAO valuation.\nAnd that's okay.\nAnd you know, people, you know, basically $TAO goes up in value because people like to consume the AI product and and so far that's actually worked and that's in fact how Bitcoin works, right?\nSo when people are like, some people are like, that's dumb and other people like, no, it's not.\nIt already worked amazingly well.\nYou have this $2 trillion asset, one of world, one of earth's greatest products of all time, Bitcoin, and it works exactly like that.\nAnd other people are like, well, that's unnatural.\nThis is like it's like a Soviet Union, you know, kind of thing where, you know, the government, you know, funds everything and that's just how it works.\nThere's no real free market.\nSo, that's that's sort of one view, right?\nThat's the way it should be.\nThe other view is that uh $TAO and DTOW tokens uh should function like a VC and this is an incubator and you get a little bit of, you get a grace period and maybe it's a year, maybe it's two years, but at some point get the out earn revenue and and and you should be buying back, maybe you should be buying back tokens or the tokens should be used as utility tokens in your ecosystem.\nSo, for example, in your universe, it would be like, you know, if I if you want a forecast, great.\nShow back up here with some GAIA Subnet tokens to pay for the forecast.\nThat's the only currency that's good here.\nLike, that'd be that's one thesis of how to do it.\nWhat do you think about the overall, you know, what makes a successful subnet and how should this work ideally?\nYeah.\nSo, I have a few ideas about that.\nI mean, I'll just go back to my analogy that um DTA kind of forces a company to be public before they're ready to be public.\nSo, traditional VC structure is like, you know, they're buying the idea, they're buying the team, and they believe in you, and they give you some time to make it happen.\nWhereas you launch a subnet and you have immediate sell pressure from the greater market.\nIt's not huge yet, but um that is really difficult, especially if you want to tackle something that requires more R&D.\nSo pre-detail, we're quite comfortable.\nWe're like, okay, like we're doing research, there's no rush to get revenue.\nUh, we're just, you know, seeing what is at the forefront of this particular space and uh trying to advance it and now it's like, okay, well now we need to monetize it because the clock is ticking on on just like coasting off of uh hopes and dreams, you know.\nYeah.\nI was going to say like subnets are built off of blood, sweat, and tears.\nLike successful ones, you got to put in a lot of work.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd it's clear the work has increased ever since the launch of DTO because you're right, the eye of Sauron, meaning me, I'm one of the eyes of Sauron, right?\nI mean, I have to, I'll confess.\nI mean, I was paying attention to subnets before DTO, but after DTO, it's like a whole new level of like, you know, scrutinizing all of these things and and actually and a whole new level of information flowing at me from all of these things and from everyone else who's looking at all of these things.\nSo in terms of a forcing function to get greater scrutiny on subnets, absolutely DTO has been a massive success, right?\nSo so round one goes to the DTA designers.\nI don't think they got everything right, but I think they got that right for sure.\nYeah, I agree.\nI think that like the the free market aspect of it is super powerful.\nThere are still some that slip through the cracks and um are able to, you know, boost a valuation on on nothing, but for the most part, it seems to work really well.\nIf if there's a good product, people buy it.\nIf there's not, they don't.\nAnd and I think that's great.\nUm going back to your your question about how how DTO should function.\nIf it was to function more like an incubator again.\nUm I don't think the current mechanics are are set up for that to work very well.\nUh for that you would kind of need token lockups.\nUm maybe some sort of like grace period to revenue before you start getting like the the whole network sell pressure.\nUm, so right now it's kind of like the the best way to success that I see.\nNot that I'm speaking from like, you know, hindsight because we're still battling it out, but it is like launch with a great idea, hype the out of it, and then that is going to be what you need to fund your entire project.\nOr maybe you get outside sources of funding as well, but ultimately you better move pretty quickly um or the funding dries up.\nWhat do you, I mean, what do you think about um OTC deals where people where venture capitalists come in and buy a bunch of your tokens and and lock them up maybe contractually, probably?\nI don't think there's any way to really do it.\nI mean on the on the D on the Bittensor EVM, maybe there's a way to do it uh down the road, but at the at the moment, I don't believe that exists, but let's just say there's some way to lock them up.\nUm what do you think about that as a mechanism?\nI and I noticed in some of your literature, you guys sent me some stuff.\nThere was an idea for token bonds.\nSo, you know, kind of like treasuries but with subnet tokens.\nWhat do you think about those kinds of ideas?\nI think it's a great idea.\nUm we we have had a few offers like that.\nUm and I think our main concern in that regard was one, we don't quite need the money yet.\nUm so why would we uh you know, introduce a new liability?\nAnd if it was contractually obligated, I would say it would feel better.\nBut there's, I guess crypto in general, there's not a lot of trust in the space that if you go sell someone, you know, half of your subnet alpha tokens and for quick cash in the hope that they won't dump on you when it is the worst, probably going to dump on you.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo I think it's definitely risky, but uh if you had a smart contract to say, well, it has to be locked up this long, um that would certainly help.\nI think the bonds idea could be implemented at a chain level.\nUm, where and it would introduce like, it it would be the same thing basically, just a way for investors to get in in a a longer term way, a way for the subnet to get quicker cash upfront, maybe just in $TAO instead of in the alpha token.\nAnd um I think it could be helpful, but again, it's it's hard.\nIt's like once you start introducing these larger sums of money, then you know, you have to make a lot more of a compelling story as to why people should lock up $100,000 with you for x amount of time.\nSo I think they're all potentially very good mechanisms that could work well for some subnets, not as well for others.\nWhat we're trying to do is just hold on to as much of our own value as we can for now and and then we can like really dictate our sales strategy such that we're not killing our price or or killing investor sentiment.\nUm and it's hard.\nI mean, most subnets are facing this issue.\nIt's like, yeah, how how do you take your money out now without scaring everybody?\nIf you if you sell, you know, more than five $TAO worth of your token, everyone's like, \"Oh, no.\"\nThey founders are dumping.\nYeah, exactly.\nIt's a scam.\nI knew it.\nYeah, there's a lot of that.\nI know.\nI know.\nAnd I I've been talking to the people directly and I know they're not a scam, but that the you know, it's amazing how the conspiracy theories arise in Discord the second you know, some somebody's wallet moves three inches.\nRight.\nSo yeah.\nUm so let me ask you another question.\nSo there's another there's another sub subnet, at least one that I'm aware of, uh that's also doing weather called Zeus and I don't understand exactly what they do versus what you do, but what I do, what I've heard is that they are actually, you guys have different focuses and you might actually be synergistic.\nCan you talk a little bit about that?\nLike are you competitors or not?\nI think yeah, Steven should should take a stab at this.\nYeah, I could take this.\nSo I I'll preface this by saying it's probably always good that there's multiple subnets trying to solve the same problem or work within the same field.\nI think that competition isn't that good.\nI mean, you see this with the compute subnets.\nYou know, it might take that like, you know, a few subnets in a certain trying to solve a certain problem have to show up first for someone to build on their success and failure to arrive at like a a proper novel solution.\nUm, and you know, I think in the future, you know, there could possibly be a route where we can collaborate with Zeus.\nUm, I might get some details exactly wrong about what they specifically do.\nUm, they seem to focus more on regional predictions.\nUm, I think with only 2-meter temperature right now.\nSo, we have like nine variables.\nUm, they have, they're focusing on a single variable.\nAnd I might get this wrong, but they seem to be wanting people to build a model from the ground up, like a completely novel architecture.\nUm, which is, you know, a valid approach, but I think it's a much steeper hill to climb than to than just starting with an already state-of-the-art model and just find And you guys are starting with Microsoft Aurora.\nThat's what you're referring to specifically.\nYes.\nOkay.\nRight.\nAnd then I I guess our focus then is the infrastructure and the incentive mechanism around that model.\nLike can we get a pipeline that handles, you know, a ton of data?\nI think the task generates around two terabytes of data a day across like 200 miners.\nUm so it's it's more how do you process and move that data around the network?\nYou know, how do you score, how do you incentivize miners to extend and improve the model and keep pushing the boundary of AI models further and further?\nYeah, I would say I would say it's what you're doing is analogous to what shoots does.\nLike shoots doesn't say, you know, upload your own AI model that they're like, no, no, we want, we want basically somebody to provide deep mind, right?\nWe want you to provide uh Mistral or whatever llama or whatever.\nRight.\nSo, you're doing the same thing with with with the weather model, the standard weather model that's out there.\nCorrect.\nRight.\nYeah, that is correct.\nAnd I will say in the future um there there's a lot of room for us to add new variables, which is honestly one of the big reasons we picked this model over um Google's graphcast, for example.\nThis one's much more modifiable.\nAnd you know, if if miners start reaching a limit of accuracy and skill, we can always add new variables, add new tasks.\nSay tracking ocean currents or tracking pollution in the atmosphere, doing you know, long range, long-term ice, you know, layer predictions, etc.\nLike there's a lot of flexibility for what we could possibly do.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nUm I just want to say like, yeah, there's no ill will.\nUm, and we like if if both of our teams were one team, we would be unstoppable, you know.\nSo, it's good to\n\n\nI have two teams in a space.\nUm, but yeah.\nYeah.\nWhere there's a Coke, there's a Pepsi.\nWhere there's a DC, there's a Marvel.\nThat's good.\nStar Sprite, you know.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nExactly.\nRight.\nSo, it's always it's always good to have competition like that.\nTotally agree.\nUm and and and frankly uh it doesn't really you know it it both of you being very great benefits $TAO.\nSo $TAO wins either way, right?\nSo that's that's fantastic.\nI'd rather have it all be in the Bittensor ecosystem than even somewhere else, right?\nSo So yeah, that's that's great.\nSo uh other sort of philosophical question, uh there there's sort of two things of foot right now.\nOne is uh a number of voices are saying that the Root Emissions uh in $TAO are too are you know the root is too damn high right as I keep saying right so and and and by that I mean that the if you stake your $TAO in root at the moment you're making somewhere between 20% and 25% APY so this disincentivizes you from moving that $TAO into subnets maybe losing it all uh maybe making 80% or 300% APY kind of depending on what you put it in, right?\nSo, uh, but you have to make a choice and you have to you have to place bets if you move it into subnets and there's, as I said earlier, only 7% of $TAO has dained to move itself into subnets.\nSo, 93% of it is sitting in root and of that roughly 66% is currently staked in root and earning 20 to 25% APY.\nPretty cushy life, right?\nBut it's a pretty highly subsidized life.\nIt's like welfare for a bunch of able-bodied $TAO, right?\nThat could could be employed and working, right?\nAnd it's just sort of sitting on the couch playing video games, eating chips.\nUm, what do you think about that?\nDo you think is the root too damn high and should we fix that or not?\nThat's a good question.\nI I'm not sure if any of us particularly have like a a very strong opinion on that uh just because we've been so focused on the the actual development of Gaia_AI.\nYou got like real to do.\nYou're not paying attention to the quibbles.\nYeah.\nBut I know that uh our founder uh Bad English T on Twitter, he um he's of the mindset that root is fine.\nIt's just like things are kind of correcting and and so we had this initial flood into alpha like the you know the pioneers of $TAO jumped in.\nThey were really eager.\nUh, some of them made a lot of money, some of them did not, some of them lost a lot of money.\nUm, and so I I can't quite speak to like I know they did a ton of modeling when they were designing subnets around like what the right root weight should be and and how fast it should drop compared to alpha weight.\nUm, in the context of a single subnet.\nUm, one thing we were really frustrated with was the root cell pressure in the beginning.\nUm, it's not as bad now, but initially it was like nobody's even selling and we're still losing 5% a day.\nUm, but now I think it's it's kind of evened out a little bit for us because we had this subnet launched with $TAO essentially.\nSo we're down to like 45% of root weight.\nAnd um as far as the APY goes, I I'm not sure because I think it is an attractive system for people who are like delving into $TAO but maybe not ready to take a full risk yet on a subnet.\nYeah.\nAnd I think that that pressure is good for the overall network to say like, oh well, I can buy $TAO and I can stake it and I can get this return on it and I don't have to take like huge risks yet, but the opportunity is there.\nUm, is it too high?\nMaybe.\nI I think like it would be cool if we saw a a lot of that $TAO come into subnets.\nUm it's just I I wonder on on like longer time scales if that is really like a concern like we need to adjust the hyperparameter or we should just kind of like wait it out and eventually uh root will drop by design and then it will be more attractive to purchase alpha.\nSo yeah, I guess that was kind of a non-answer but that's that's where I'm at with that pretty much but that's okay.\nYeah, go ahead, Steven.\nYou had something?\nYeah, I was going to say I mean, you know, I don't have a strong opinion about this either.\nIt I guess my intuition says it's probably slightly too high.\nUm, and I guess the best that subnets can do right now.\nAnd what we're trying to do is, you know, have a compelling enough narrative and product that you can bring people away from this comfortable life staking to root to, you know, put the $TAO into subnets and then support and believe projects.\nUm, you know, that's the best you can do right now.\nAnd, you know, I could I could hear arguments from both sides saying, \"Oh, it's fine or you we just need better projects, better subnets.\"\nUm, but I I do probably think that it is slightly too high, personally.\nGabriel, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but like I when I use, you know, a trading app, their APY is way lower, you know, if I hold within the app.\nUm, so I don't know.\nI would say a quarter of a 100% is is high, you know.\nUm just in just you know statistically speaking in anything um like we don't even as subnet owners own 20% of our subnet you know so it's like when you put it in that perspective I don't know I would say it's a little high okay so mildly high is sort of what I'm getting here from the from the group so yeah I hope this doesn't bite us you know no no I this It's an opinion.\nI don't think anybody knows for sure what the right answer is.\nI got to be honest.\nI mean, after this past weekend, I I you know, my own brain went went to um you know, it should be around three or 4%.\nI think you should get something.\nI I think it makes I think $TAO is an attractive asset and the fact that it makes some yield.\nYou know, it's better than Bitcoin in that sense, right?\nI kind of like that, right?\nSo, uh I kind of feel like you should get some reward, but I also feel like right, you know, 20 to 25% is like, you know, that's that's blockchain obesity.\nYeah.\nRight?\nLike it's you got to get in the gym and you got to go tonight.\nSorry.\nIt's it's just it's time.\nSo yeah, that's sort of what I'm that's sort of where my brain is at.\nThere are other there are other very smart people who disagree with me that I've been having sidebar conversations with.\nSo um you know, I'm not positive of that, but that's that's what I think right now.\nGo ahead, Noah.\nI've certainly not heard of anyone arguing that it should be higher at least.\nMore chips.\nEat more chips and some ice cream sundaes.\nI think 3 or 4% that feels reasonable to me as well and that would certainly make buying into subnets a lot more attractive and then if we have more liquidity in all the subnets too then things wouldn't necessarily be so volatile.\nUm yeah, I I think that that sounds like you know a good number but I guess we'll just see what happens.\nIt doesn't seem like F really wants to make a move on that either way.\nUm, if there are enough voices that say, \"Oh, it has to be lower,\" maybe that'll happen.\nBut I think for now, we can survive where it is at since we've gotten past the the 50/50 inflection point.\nUm, the root selling pressure on on our subnet is is quite a bit lower.\nIt's not nearly as noticeable.\nSo, uh, but for new subnets, it's, you know, starts at 100.\nSo that's tricky for sure.\nUh they might be stifling some innovation there.\nYeah.\nWell, okay.\nWell, I hope it resolves itself.\nI'm also looking forward to um you know, the future universe, which hopefully is going to be arriving soon, like hopefully in June even where liquidity from other chains can start making its way into subnet tokens in particular.\nThere is no way for somebody on Salana to just spend some Salana and and get some shoots tokens, right?\nAnd if there was a way to do that, I think we'd all agree everything would be up like 10x probably overnight, right?\nLike if that door opened up.\nAnd um there's a number of efforts underway to sort of make that happen.\nAnd there's some debate over, you know, what the right approach is.\nAre wrap tokens the right way to go?\nUh is remote control of a $TAO native w cloud wallet via a Salana wallet the right way to go because it respects the $TAO backing of all the subnet tokens and gets rid of the bridge.\nYou know, maybe that's a better way to go, right?\nSo, uh I I'm not really sure what the right approach is, but I but I I do agree that somebody should solve this and soon and thank God there's several parties, you know, apparently near to doing it.\nDo you guys uh closing thoughts on that?\nDo you guys have any opinions on that?\nI'm really excited for when it is solved.\nUm, I think I mean imagine like all the people in the Salana trenches that have been playing around with me Vince for 2 years and there's so much liquidity.\nI I can't wait to see what happens when that liquidity maybe starts to move on to like projects that are are trying to to build something real.\nYeah, that's the way I feel about that.\nThere's so much liquidity and it just it's going into just sadness, right?\nYeah, like it just chat bots on Twitter are are worth billions of dollars and come you guys predicting planetwide weather and you know and you're nowhere near the billion dollar valuation, right?\nLike every I think the last time I checked you guys is like the single digit millions, right?\nWhich is absurd.\nIt's absolutely absurd, right?\nChat bots are worth billions and you guys are single- digit millions.\nThat that is like like that can flip.\nThe only problem is that the salon people can't get to you and they don't know about you.\nThat's it.\nIt's the only reason why.\nAnyway, yeah, we're we're definitely rooting for all of those projects.\nI know Subnet 10 uh I forget the other ones, but uh any whoever does it first, we are going to be very happy with them.\nAnd yeah, maybe we should tell uh Ian Bad English T to go support those subnets a little bit while they work on it.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nHe's the money guy.\nAny any closing thoughts, guys?\nWe're coming up on the hour here and and now's the time to plug anything you got, your Twitter handle, whatever.\nSo, starting with you, Noah, what do you got?\nUm, well, first of all, thanks for having us on.\nThat was a lot of fun.\nAnd, um, we have a lot of exciting things in the pipeline.\nYou can check out our website.\nIt's gaia.ai.\nYou can check us out at Subnet57 in the Bittensor Discord.\nWe also have a Twitter.\nUh, you can find us all over the place.\nBut essentially what we just want to say is that what's coming up now that we have the task launched is that we are going to be monetizing the task and we're hoping to be one of the first Bittensor subnets to actually generate real revenue.\nUm I know there's a few but yeah we want to be one of the first.\nIt's not a lot of them that have hit that milestone yet and we think we're we're pretty close.\nWe're knocking on that door.\nSo very awesome.\nThat's what I want to say.\nYeah.\nStephen, what do you got?\nAnything?\nYeah, thank you for having us.\nUm, Noah plugged the website on there.\nYou'll also find links to our Substack.\nI think on Twitter as well, reads our Substack posts.\nYou can also find our abstracts.\nWe went to the European Geoscience Union Convention in Vienna present to real scientists for soil moisture.\nUm, and then just like general subnet architecture.\nSo, you can check out those abstracts online as well.\nUm, our website has a lot of cool new visuals now for the Weather Patterns task.\nThere's a there's a globe.\nUm, Soon you'll be able to, you know, pay and get data access as well.\nAnd if you're a minor, if you're interested, if you have domain knowledge, you know, come hop on Gaia, find who to model, you know, compete against other minors.\nWe're always looking for smart people, PhDs, everything.\nLook at you guys with PhDs and going to conferences in Vienna like to predict the Weather Patterns planetwide and meme coins on Salana are worth a billion dollars.\nLike, it just drives me.\nIt makes me want to just kill myself, but I won't do that because I've got more shows to do.\nYes.\nYeah, exactly.\nDon't do that.\nGabriel, what do you got?\nUm, yeah, thanks for having us.\nI just want to um let you know, yeah, stay tuned.\nWe we have also some like widget tools coming out um once uh Weather Patterns data comes in.\nSo, that will be more like userfriendly.\nUm you can just add it to your phone and see the weather 10day forecast.\nUm, and yeah, we're in talks uh with I don't know if you've heard of um BAE Systems and uh also we have contacts with a bunch of um actual scientists from Noah and LASP and Swiri who are going to be coming on and helping us mine.\nSo yeah.\nWow.\nA lot of good stuff coming.\nThat's super cool.\nThat's kind of like the um people who work at uh Google and Microsoft, you know, also running subnets.\nLike that's actually another trend that I've seen, right?\nIt's it's it's pretty wild, right?\nOr or even just mining in shoots or something like that, right?\nSo, yeah.\nAll right, guys.\nUh this has been awesome.\nI'm really happy that we did this and I I I'm a fan and a token holder and I wish you all great and giant success.\nMy name is Mark Jeffrey.\nThis has been Hash Rate.\nWe'll see you all next time.\n",
