  "cleanText": "Hello everybody and welcome to Hash Rate. My name is Mark Jeffrey. My guest today is PM PragmaticMonkey from RUJIRA. Hello PM. How you doing? Hi Mark. Super nice meeting you and uh glad to be here. Really excited to to spend the hour with you and uh and let's explore what we're building at RUJIRA. Yeah, I'm totally excited as well. I mean I've been a you know I've been a big fan of THORChain for a long time. You know, kind of a big vocal fan. And I just for those who don't know, THORChain is like this, I mean, it's called a chain, which I think is sort of a misnomer because really it's a crosschain DEX that is powered by a chain, right? So, so really it's like crosschain DEX THOR thing, right? That and then the flux capacitor that makes it all work is the THORChain, right? And the magic is is that um you you can basically you can use Bitcoin, raw Bitcoin um and it goes, you know, basically into this crosschain DEX into any other coin on any other chain and you can do that with any any coin on any chain that's connected to it. Um and it's that is extremely powerful and it's totally permissionless. Um kind of huge and cool, right? Like what how long have you been sort of watching THORChain? I know you're like deep neck deep in it now, but like you didn't start that way. So tell me about your sort of relationship and and with THORChain. Okay. So so first you nailed it like it's a THORChain is kind of one level uh level deeper in the abstraction of all those blockchains like it's not just yet another blockchain and you need a bridge to go there and then it's an isolated island. It's actually this blockchain that connects them all a bit. What effectively uh the Cosmos was trying to do but failed and was doing that only with a very limited scope which was other Cosmos chain. Here um the THORChain team GTO who started that and Chad back in the day they came they use this amazing Cosmos SDK technology and build a chain that really connects all the other chains no matter if it's Bitcoin, Etherum, Avax, XRP, now Docoin, like all those chain including some which don't have smart contract capabilities and we are going to come back to that because that's uh what make what we are doing very powerful but so it's it's this h that allows any conction chain to to do those crosschain native transfer. I have Bitcoin on the Bitcoin chain. I want Etherum on the Etherum chain and in a fully permissionless decentralized fashion. I sign a transaction on my Bitcoin wallet and a few blocks later I get my Ethereum in my Etherum wallet. So that's what it is. You you asking about uh how I got there. So I used not to be familiar uh at not not at all. I I followed from far uh the the THORChain ecosystem but I I really did not know much about it till last summer effectively. I knew it was this crosschain DEX and it has this cool culture of quite a lot of OG's, cyber punk, Eric Waries and these type of people which I really like and uh feel like align philosophically and uh so I I was always following a bit but never dig into the tech before that and then uh so what happened is so I was uh mostly like I was part of the Kujira community in the Kujira ecosystem we were this uh maybe I can go back a bit on the uh Kujira started uh as an application on Terra back in 2021 when Terra was this big amazing ecosystem where you could do all those things. It was just doing uh it was just started with one app called the Orca which was a very cool thing. It was effectively allowing you to uh uh democ it was democratizing access to liquidations effectively. And so instead of having um those typical liquidation mechanism that you have on most money markets whether it's a compound or uh any CDP markets as well like maker or whatever it always works the same way you get a liquidation goes like you have a fixed uh discount and then you have a arbitrage that can come and whenever there's you have your collateral that goes below certain LTV threshold it become at risk be liquidated and arbitrageer can come and buy at a fixed discount to market price this collateral and in the same block usually sell it which triggers us big liquidation candles that you see on charts and uh it's only available for uh a few very experienced people that know how to operate MV bots and there is no market for it meaning like the disc discount is set and it means that effectively people who get liquidated end up paying more than they should if the market was efficient and what Orca was doing at that time they managed to get plugged. So it was I wasn't part of the team yet. So that's why I say they they managed to get plugged into encore which was this biggest learning protocol on terra uh and you could liquidate atrisisk collateral on encore using ora via auction process meaning like anybody could come and say oh now there is this amount of uh of terra or they also had like a rap stack is and a few other asset ax as well added before the collapse. And so you could come and bids on the risk collateral and it create a market and so you get this touch auction process where bids are filled from the lowest discount to the highest discount and effectively it means that it create competition it reduce the cost of liquidation for liquidator and anybody can participate via simple UX you okay there's there's a lot here you just said so let me try to recapitulate it for those who might not have followed all of that right because there are some people who watch the show aren't familiar with all this stuff so so your so RUJIRA or sorry RUJIRA It's now called that was Kujira at the time. Yes, I'm getting there. So, RUJIRA is what it's called now because it's it's in RUNE or the THORChain, right? So, it got renamed, but it used to be this thing called Kujira and it that existed in the Terra Luna ecosystem before the collapse, right? And there was a little moment in history where that was the hot new chain. And so, all these DeFi apps arose and this one collateralized debt position lending protocol that you were just referring to, I think you called it Orca, was was part of the suite, right? So no, Enkor was the big you know enor the the protocol that allow you on terra to mint US the stable coin that failed. So and Orca was plugged into ENOR. They managed to get plugged into ENOR to allow to have this difference this more fair liquidation system for people participating. The liquidations are usually for super smart people and so and there's usually like not very many of them. Um, and basically blockchains have to have some outside actor poke them to to do things, right? There's no cron jobs inside of blockchains, right? There's no automated code. Something from the outside has to poke them. So, when there's a loan and there's collateral uh which is dipped bel its value is dipped below a liquidation threshold. It's now available for liquidation, but somebody from the outside has to come and poke it and actually liquidate it. And when they do that, they can make a little bit of money, right? So it's like they get a little cash and prizes for liquid for helping the blockchain liquidate these collateralized debt positions. There used to be no competition in that. It used to be too hard for people to get into. So this your protocol that you're referring to made it easy. So there was an actual marketplace and competition. So it's not no longer just, you know, three of my friends who can do it. Now it's like a whole bunch of people, maybe a couple hundred people that can come in there and, you know, compete, you know, oh, I'll do it for this price and it's a lot lower than that other price, right? So that's basically what you said. Correct. Yeah. Exactly. That was it. So, so and sorry like we are going on a a big tangent. Uh but you say you edit after so feel free to cut. Yeah, no worries. No worries. I like we're here now so I might as well just you know let's clear it up. It's a it's a longest story so I spend a bit of time. So that was part one. So Kujira was just that actually the day they the team launched a second product the day the USD collapse and it was called Finn. It was 100% on chain order books. Uh I I'll come back to that in a minute. But it launched on initially on the same day as USD dep and everything else. So, so you know, I was talking I was actually at the time I was contemplating doing a uh a crypto hedge fund. And so I was investigating all of the ways in which you could do custody and I was talking to the Fireblocks guys and Fireblocks is one of the major crypto custody solutions for you know industrial grade hedge funds and banks and things like that and uh and they just they had just like two weeks previously to the collapse launched Fireblocks Terra Luna support and they're like oh my god we're getting more traction transactions we've ever gotten more usage like the usage was absolutely insane. and and they'd worked on that uh you know extension for Fireblocks for like a year and a half like they busted their ass on it and like it only got two weeks of life and then the whole thing collapsed and I felt so bad for them because I was just watching that going oh my god you poor guys terrible and they it's a great team like I mean it's a very useful product that help effectively bridge the gap for for institutions to go on chain and uh I think it's a we need that at the end we need capital to influence in our ecosystem to win so it's it's very helpful so yeah feeling for them. But that explain why we are in talk with them in the chapter two of our history. Uh and so probably because they have done this work for Terra, it was relatively easy for them to add smaller chains. Yeah. Okay. So that was uh um that was uh chapter one. Then uh happened what happened? So the collapse of Terra uh all uh all this infinite meeting loop of US the dep uh loes shirt in this story. Um so uh Kujira was part of that. we lost like pretty much uh over half of the treasury of the race we have made because it was in US but uh it's it was a team so it was three co-founder uh at the time and uh very an incredible team uh and I was following them for me like I was just I started as just a user of this amazing product that was our car and then bought a bit of Kuji token and uh I was just a community member very involved uh but that was it and then on the collapse of of terra Um so I was in the telegram and you know it is in crypto and they I knew like they were saying they will continue doing something else. Uh so for me it was like the opportunity. I was like okay is I had a lot of fun tied into the ecosystem. I just went with everything I could salvage into Kuji and that gave me a a decent size back compared to my uh the total size of my portfolio. So I I became kind of very involved after that into this ecosystem because uh I was just very much align both ideologically about what those guy were trying to do which was really trying to find parts of the blockchain uh segments like the liquidation that were not up to the promise of what we are trying to do which is build a more fair more transparent and more accessible financial ecosystem for the world and uh having a system where only MV bots can participate is not really in line to that. So I was really like aligned ideologically but then after that also economically because uh Kuji was only trading in USD uh so the depect did not really have any impact and everybody was selling to try to move to another chain. So I ended up like with a small share of the supply and sub one% but for me it was it was very big at the time. So I became all in uh and so from there uh it did not miss uh around 3 weeks late 3 months later the team relaunched as an independent server chain on um on the Cosmos in the Cosmos ecosystem. So with the Cosmos SDK same tech as to chain uh but uh and then they started to build this amazing suite of of DeFi tools. So uh of course uh the oral equation engine but also like they started to integrate uh every piece of uh of the defy stack you can think of. So it was this like what let's let's specifically run through like what's what's in there what's what's in the goodie bag. Yeah. So, so if you you had like a so the core I would say the biggest revenue contributor and the core of it was Finn this 100% onchain order book decks and I insist that 100% onchain this is I haven't seen anybody pulling that off yet uh on any other ecosystem because usually you have like uh other like order book decks that you see on chain they are not 100% on chain you usually have the matching of order that happen offchain and from the moment you have something happening offchain It means anybody who is responsible for doing the matching of order can effectively front run the other and there is some sort of of value extraction that is possible to whoever come first. Uh and the Kujira team like in line with this ethos of really trying to do things there managed to do this matching on chain with a zero to one complexity meaning that you can scale to pretty much infinity. uh the more volume you get it doesn't increase the load on the application itself and everything happen at the same price for everyone. So if you want to sell an asset at 100s at the price of 100s, everybody in this bucket uh if the price gets there get filled proportionally to the to to to the size of their order compared to to the total of orders at this level. And so that's very unique because uh we get into the nitty-gritty of how an exchange work. But those are very things that No, but I think that that's I mean I do think you make a really good point. So, a completely onchain order book DEX. Um, and I've heard many people claim that they've done it. So, I I and I don't know, you know, who's lying, who's not lying. I have heard this claim before. And you're and and everyone brings up the matching is is the thing that the is is impossible or really hard to do on chain. Um, and and so a lot of people cheat and don't do it on chain. They just do it offchain. They go, &quot;Well, everything's a Dex except for that, right?&quot; and um and they just sort of sweep that under the rug. But you guys are claiming no, we actually did it. Everything is completely on chain. Now, don't you need a super fast chain in order to service that or is that does that not matter? No, not necessarily. I mean, like with the Cosmos SDK, it's already a super high performance uh text stack.\n\n\nSo, it's really not an issue. We never had any performance issues. I really invite you to go and try it. You will see it's fast and responsive. It's quite nice.\n\nSo, you had this order book DEX. Because it's an order book, it works a bit differently. Like most of, pretty much actually all the DEXs you have in blockchains are IMM DEXs, like the automated market maker. The DEXs are one and the same thing. You will have a bonding curve that defines the price over which you get executed. You put one asset in, you get another asset out, and the quantity you put in defines how much you get out. It's a single bonding curve. It can be xyk all the way along from zero to infinity or concentrated, but it's a single curve.\n\nWith an order book, you can be much more expressive, and you have much, much higher capital efficiency. If there is somebody who wanted to transact for 10 billion of Bitcoin at a price of 100k, and somebody on the other side was willing to buy, and the other is willing to sell at the same quantity at the same price, you can move 10 billion with zero price impact. That's the max capital efficiency you can achieve, and this is only possible with an order book.\n\nWe have the order book, which allows this type of stuff. Then we have, effectively, you need an order book like in a traditional market to still have market makers that facilitate liquidity. We have the IMM part that is separated from the order book. It's a multi-strategy IMM that is just layering different strategies on top of the order book. The order book acts effectively as an intent matching of various sources of liquidity. In the source of liquidity, you will have, for example, limit orders by regular users. We have different types of orders. I don't know if you want to go too deep into that, but...\n\nI just want to get a general flyby. So you've got the order book, you've got the DEX, you got the AMM. You have per stable coins. What else we got in the bag?\n\nSo, a money market, like a standard money market where you can deposit collateral and borrow. This means that we also get liquidation in giant Orca back in the game because if you have leverage, you need to protect the system's solvency, and so you need Orca to do that in a nice way where everybody can participate. We will have that's very unique, but thanks to THORChain technology, we can have access to native Bitcoin. So we'll do a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin. So that's also on the menu.\n\nWait, wait, wait, wait, Bitcoin-backed stablecoin?\n\nYeah, so that's one of the things that's awesome. It's big, and that's only possible thanks to THORChain. This is literally the only way to do that in a 100% decentralized fashion and without having to rely on a third party that is wrapping.\n\nYeah, like wrapped Bitcoin or something, right? This is actually a really, really, really big point. So I want to make sure we don't gloss over it. Right. So because you have THORChain, you can do operations with native Bitcoin on the native Bitcoin chain that you simply cannot do anywhere else. Anywhere else, you have to have wrapped Bitcoin, right? Which involves giving your Bitcoin to like some guy who then says, \"Here's a wrapped Bitcoin token on Ethereum or on Solana or whatever, right?\" But that's kind of [ __ ] because what if that guy runs away and then your Bitcoin's gone, right?\n\nExactly. So, that's actually the biggest. We started with the work done through the apps, but that maybe we should have started there. So that's I think the biggest point today. If you want to use Bitcoin in DeFi, your best shot, the biggest market, is to use wrapped Bitcoin. What is wrapped Bitcoin? It's a Bitcoin that is issued by a centralized custodian. So, BitGo in that case. So you have to trust BitGo, which has probably like three or five multisig or something like that, which we have seen again recently with Bybit can be hacked, and those acts happen. Then they custody it, and then they issue a representation of it on the Ethereum blockchain. If you want to use it on Ethereum, you can use this wrapped version, or you may want to use it on another ecosystem. Then you will use a third-party bridge, which is also going to add an extra layer of exogenous risk. You will bridge that to another ecosystem, and then you have your wrapped bridge Bitcoin, and that's just adding two layers of exogenous risk and trust and the centralization. You don't have to, thanks to THORChain technology, and that's really the biggest, like, the biggest win for us.\n\nWe had all this amazing tech we built on Kujira. The issue is we were competing in a very small ecosystem, which is the Cosmos ecosystem and a small chain inside this ecosystem, and we are struggling to attract liquidity. We had built an amazing rocket, but we had no fuel to make it fly. THORChain solved that and not just solved that by bringing some bridge liquidity. It solves that with the most elegant way possible with native liquidity.\n\nNow, so thanks to THORChain, it means that you can...\n\nYeah. So let's just give people like sort of a scoping of the size here. The last time it looked like the amount of TVL, or total value locked, in DeFi in Ethereum was something like $80 billion, something like that. Yeah. That's about, yeah, something like that, right? And then, like, and then I looked at, and then Solana is like about 8 billion, right? So it's, you know, one-tenth of what Ethereum is. Ethereum is like roughly half of all the TVL in DeFi. But if you compare that to Bitcoin, Bitcoin has $2 trillion dollars worth of liquidity in it, right? And mostly just sitting there, right? Like it's like there's Bitcoin sitting in people's ledgers in their sock drawer, and it's not doing anything, right? Because it can't do anything because you can't, there's no smart contract, right? And you have to wrap it, and something like 1% of Bitcoin is wrapped Bitcoin. So, you know, some Bitcoin has been bridged over, but 99% of it's scared, right? And properly so because people have gotten burned by Celsius and, you know, other things, right? So, people are like, \"Yeah, I don't, you know, it's gold. I just want to, I just want it to sit there. I don't want to do anything with it.\" But if there was some way to safely, you know, get yield or make it do things in a way that everybody felt very safe about it, more of that two trillion would move into an ecosystem that provided those opportunities, or at least some part of it would. Right.\n\nExactly. That's what you guys have done. That's the issue. Like, we don't need, and we will never get, even like 50% of the Bitcoin supply because most of the Bitcoin outcome maximalists, they don't want to do anything with their Bitcoin. There's a big part that at the end, you can have a big stack of Bitcoin, but if you keep it in your drawer and you don't use it, then you don't, you don't enjoy the financial freedom it gives to you because you cannot monetize it in the real world. So either at some point you need to sell some of it, or if you believe, which I think it's a case for most people, that in the long run, governance are going to continue to be completely irresponsible, and the only way out of the massive debt we have is to print more fiat currency to repay the stock of debt, preserves the interest. Then it means that the quantity of money, fiat money, in the system is going to continue to increase exponentially over the long run, as it has been the case already for the past 80 years or so. That means that Bitcoin, which has a finished supply, is mechanically going to appreciate in dollar value just because now there is more dollar in the system, and there is the same quantity of Bitcoin. So it's a denominator effect. It's mechanical, and so it makes Bitcoin like the pristineest form of collateral you can imagine. So it makes it the perfect asset if you want to still finance your life, but you don't want to sell it. Well, you can borrow against it at a safe LTV level. That's one way to use it.\n\nI think, and doing that, you could do either with a money market and borrow USDC against it, or you can also do that via a stable stablecoin that allows you to mint a new token, and that's another way. It's the same mechanism, but it's another way to get some money out, and then you will have to have liquidity for this stablecoin towards something that you can offramp. So it's a big, like, long-term project, but the potential is just massive, and that's true for Bitcoin.\n\nTHORChain allows us to give access to DeFi with native assets, and that works for all connected chains, including those chains like Bitcoin, which up to now don't have an app player because they don't have smart contracts. Now they will have an app player with smart contracts. They will be able to portion of the community that is interested into that will be able to do all those cool DeFi stuff that we have been doing in other environments, but it's also like very powerful because it's not just the case for Bitcoin. It's also the case for all those other connected chains that don't have smart contracts. So, of course, we have THORChain connected to Ethereum, to Base, to Avalanche, but those chains, they have smart contracts. So for the user there, it's nothing crazy. But if you look at, like, you have Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, XRP. Now, like those, does XRP have smart contracts? I actually don't know. Does they don't have smart contracts? Some of side chain, like, it's very small, like, it's they know it's similar. XRP is the weirdest beast. Okay, but anyway, there's an oddball, but it's huge. It's a top 10. So, it's also like a very material amount of capital that can suddenly be unlocked into DeFi.\n\nThat, and that's really like the very exciting stuff. It's not only you get access to Bitcoin, but you can also get access to all those ecosystems. But the beauty of it as well is, so everybody's like, we are building the decentralized finance. It's been a big meme that a lot of people have been saying, but that's also what we are trying to do, but I think we are in the unique position to actually deliver on that because this tech allows us to put in one place on THORChain all together those native assets from all those connected chains, the same way that when you are on Binance or any centralized exchange, you can trade your Bitcoin and your XRP and your Dogecoin all from your same little accounts. That's exactly the experience we provide, except that it's 100% decentralized and 100% trustless and permissionless, and everybody can do it, and nobody can censor you.\n\nYeah. So no KYC on the account, any amount.\n\nYeah. As long...\n\nExactly. And we will have, like, we are partnering for on-off ramping as well directly on chain via a partner called Bangsa. So if you want to offramp, then if you want to use that, you will have to KYC above a certain threshold. You can un-off below, but if you just want to use the system, you have absolutely zero restrictions. KYC, it's just a bunch of protocol, so a bunch of rules of set set into smart contract that's anybody can access and that don't discriminate.\n\nYeah, no, that's amazing. So, okay, so you build all this stuff in Terra, and then along comes JP.\n\nTHORChain.\n\nSo, and so maybe I need to give you chapter two to finish chapter two because what happened jumping ahead. Go ahead.\n\nSo, so Terra has collapsed. We relaunched as this independent chain on the Cosmos, and the issue is it was very hard to attract liquidity. So it pushed the team at the time to take some, some, like, mismanaged, miscontrolled risk, and they started, they were borrowing USDC against Kujira, the native token, to just try to bootstrap liquidity in this ecosystem because again, like a great rocket, but no fuel. The issue is, like, it's perfectly fine to borrow against your token as long as you have a borrow cap that is a function of the on-chain liquidity. What you want is just to make sure that at any point in time, if the price goes south and your position needs to be liquidated to stay at a compliant LTV level, you need to have enough liquidity on chain to allow people to come liquidate you without crushing the price to a level that again put your position at risk. They did not put any cap at the time. So it was like a, yeah, just over optimism from the team, I think, founder overconfidence, and unfortunately, this ended up poorly in August last year when I don't know if you remember, it was this big macro event, the unwinding of the Japanese carry trade. All market crashed, like equity markets and crypto, of course, the same. During that night, it was the 31st of July to the 1st of August. I remember you remember the date. It was quite whatever this was.\n\nYeah, it was a traumatic event, and the debt position of the team got liquidated, and it wasn't enough liquidity to safely bring it back to a compliance level in terms of LTV. So it created 3 million of bad depth in the ecosystem. So 3 million is peanuts if you think about what happened with store chain or all those big EOS ecosystem, but for us, it was big. So at that point, it did have a few things changed. First, one of the three co-founders had to leave, and they asked me to join. So I was already working super close with the team and 200% in this ecosystem for two years or so, like since the collapse of Terra, and they asked me to join to help them first, like, make sure that this type of misparameterization doesn't happen again, and so have kind of more strict control on protocol parameters, and also help with trying to find AP capital to replace this bad depth and find a path forward. So I joined the team in an official capacity from that point in time, and that's also the time where we met Gipito and Gipto. So he's a very interesting character. But he, it was great, like, he really gave us the lifeline we needed. He had this vision. I think he had very, he's very good at having like big macro visions, and he had this vision of building this app layer on top of THORChain, but it's a crazy amount of work and finding a good...\n\n\nThe team to do that is very hard, and he, he was able to recognize uh, very early because he did not really know us. And I think now he's quite pleased with what we have done, but he had no clue at the time. And uh, he took a bet on us. He backstopped an emergency sales of Kujira we did to clear all the bad debt in the system. So we raised three million, and we were able to clean up everything. So all the lenders were able to be repaid, and everything was back to normal. But we did on the back of that this deal where we bailed you out.\nSo it was a bailout, like crypto bailout. So he bought a big position of Kooji uh, via sales of treasury token, and then we did this deal where we agreed to effectively uh, migrate. We will eventually sunset the Rujira chain and go and build this app layer and replicate an even better version, like, cap, like, take, sorry, sometime I, this crap, uh, capitalize on all the lessons we have learned uh, during all those years and rebuild the same thing, but even better inside this uh, amazing uh, framework that offers that to offer to us, which is access to DeFi, these native assets. And so, okay, so let me, let me just, let me just recapitulate. So, so you guys built this really great stuff, this really great DeFi engine. Um, but you, you was like, you know, in the middle of the forest. There was no foot traffic. Nobody ever came. So, nobody could find your awesome store, cuz nobody was walking around over there, right? It was a bit, we had like a very faithful uh, community of like, we have, yes, we had some hardcore people, but like, who cares? It wasn't like a very small tribe that could not grow. Yeah. It doesn't mean. So, yeah, you were like a rock band that had like, you know, five core people that loved it, but like you weren't gonna be playing stadiums anytime soon, right? Exactly. So, because you, because you never get any radio airplane, right? So, along comes Thor. He's got THORChain. THORChain, you know, say what you want about it. It's always been pretty big, right? It's always been pretty well known. It is in the mainstream. It's in the mall, but it's also not growing very fast, right? Because there's nothing to stimulate its growth, right? Like getting new users is hard. Um, but if there were apps on top of it that did things that were bringing more people in, and so he's got like a bunch of liquidity but no apps. You have a bunch of apps but no liquidity. So you all looked at each other and said, you got peanut butter, I got jelly, let's make a sandwich, right? Like that's sort of the, that's sort of what happened, right? You are great with metaphor. That's, that's love it. That's a great summary of the situation. It's exactly what happened. And so yeah, on the back of that, we decided to do this bigger uh, merger deal. So we merged together Kujira, but GP also wanted a dedicated team to do pairs. So we got the Levana team as well to join, and we had a few other teams in our ecosystem. One team was building uh, uh, NFT marketplace. So we put them on board as another core vertical. Uh, another team uh, was uh, doing uh, the launch pads. Uh, so it was a joint venture already with the Kujira team, but we bring them back in. So we merged all those teams and all those smaller tokens, but the bank one was really Kujira, and the second biggest one was Leana uh, and created this new token RUI, which is the token for the app player that effectively give you access to uh, half the cash flow from all those apps. Uh, I, I say all because uh, there are nuances in that, but effectively we have to pay to chain for uh, the economic security it provides to us and the access to those native assets. And so we agreed initially on this uh, 50/50 splits. So every single uh, apps, like, unless it directly generates revenue for the app layer because it does swaps on the base layer, otherwise we have to share uh, 50/50 the revenue with the base layer. Then it's also how you we align interest and we accrue direct value. We will accrue direct value to uh, RUNE holders and to uh, well, you know how it works, chain, like you get revenue that flows, revenue from a liquidity fees that flows into the gross system income, and then it's between bonds, node operators, and LP, depending on the incentive pendulum. Well, now you will get a new stream of income to increase this growth system income, and that's the revenue from the app layer. Yeah. What is chain making for revenue like per day right now? Do you know the numbers? Yeah, it's uh, around between, let's say, 50 and 80k per day. So, it's a very uh, profitable business, like it's for, for blockchain, if you compare to most other uh, blockchain out there. It's a, it's great, like, and that's all revenue is like pretty much profit. Yeah. Yeah. So the way it works is you get that 50 to 100k per day, depending on volumes that flows that growth system income of that 5% goes to the dev funds, which is used to fund the nine realms and all teams contributed to build this ecosystem. You can alert now 5% that goes to buy back RUNE and burn it, and then the remaining 90% is split between node operator and a liquidity provider, depending on where the incentive pendulum is, and uh, oh, and TCY holders now, and now, sorry, you're right, and so, sorry, you also TCY holders, so I'm like, I want my 10%, you're not going to, I didn't hear me in there, I got to be in there somewhere, man, my bad, you, you get also 10% taken from uh, 40CY now and at perpetuity, and then the remaining 80% flow between the LPs and the operator. Very good to wet my beak there. That's good. I like that. So, okay. But yes, so, so it's a very uh, and now, like, since uh, well, since the blow up of, they removed inflation as well, and that's been very uh, very successful because historically, like, it was a cost. You're asking if it was net pro, it was pure profit. Historically was a cost when they were also adding uh, to gross system income, inflationary rewards, but you actually don't need that. And they removed that, and it hasn't changed anything, except that they, it removed sales pressure on RUNE, and uh, it's uh, it just uh, work perfectly now because those inflation were effectively a cost for the protocol that did not need to exist, like people were happy, like we can see now they're happy to receive just a pure cash flow from the economic activity to stay as a LP or to stay as a as another operator, and so now effectively it's uh, all the revenue equal profits with the split we, we, we mentioned, but so 80% of the revenue is profit for LP operator. Okay, so this is, so now, now is RUI is up and running, right? Like it's been, and it hasn't been very long, right? It's been only like a month or something like that. How long has it been up, and is, is it, how much of is it, is up? So, so it's, it has been a very long journey because first we, the, the start of it, we had to, so to chain was built with a very old version of the Cosmos SDK. We're at version 46, and uh, the latest version was version 50, and so it looks like nothing, but we had to do like a bunch of upgrades to get them up to speed to the latest standard. So that was a first big uh, uh, thing we had to tackle, a big hurdle. We did that thanks to our, like, it's one, like the Kujira main technical co-founder, Code Ants, is an amazing, like, it's a one in a million dev, like without him, none of that would be possible, like he's really like a, I mean, it's a gift for, it was a gift for the community and it's a gift for, for to chain community because he has been like experiencing all those change at a speed that is incredible uh, now, like working very close with Nar on all those things, but uh, it was all him. So, so was, well, actually was Strange Love team also helped with part of the things, like the upgrade to Cosmos SDK50, they were there, but so it was this part that needed, then the support for those secured assets. So what we call secured asset is effectively this capability to uh, get uh, those native assets from all those connected chain into uh, to chain. So instead of having to use those third party bridges and wrapping by centralized intermediary, the way it works is you can deposit Bitcoin in one transaction in a what we call an NSG vault, which is a multi-party computational vault that store your assets with a private key that is secured by 120 node operators with a a private key that churn every three day. So it's a much, so I say still a trust model, but much more uh, secured and much more decentralized and and way less uh, trust based than anything that's like a centralized exchange or any three of five multisync.\nAnd uh, and that that allow us to connect all those chains and get all those assets as what we call secured assets, which are effectively representation of those assets locked in those vaults on the app player, and then that's where we can use them to do all sort of things uh, into DeFi. So it was, we need to add this uh, concept of secured assets uh, to be able to, to have access to that, and there was a bunch of other like technical hurdles we had to uh, to overcome. Uh, we uh, and we had also to go through all sort of audits and things and reviews, internal with, of course, the N room team and and external with other auditors involved, and um, all of that is done now. Uh, last uh, two, so two weeks ago, we finally were able to uh, so a few months before that, we launched the first smart contract was a merge contract, allowing finally people to come and deposit their Coogi, LVN, and all other token participating in the merger into this contract, uh, and uh, so we haven't minted uh, or we haven't distributed RUI yet, but now people are in there and they are earning rewards, there's a mechanism with a decay, probably no need to enter into the decay, but you already have your claim on the future RUI that's going to uh, uh, be launched probably by the end of the month if everything goes as planned, and um, so that was the first app, the first smart contract, and then we also launched uh, like finally the first app uh, two weeks ago, so the 100% chain order book decks and the first version of the IMM uh, so we call the order book decks RUI trade and the IM rouge pools, and uh, with a very simple strategy, XYK strategy, replicate a UNI v2, but in another order book, and we launched that with a very limited set of token, just the three ecosystem tokens that are migrating from Kjira to to chain, so for now there is uh, no BTC, no is no big pairs, uh, that will come uh, in the next release. So, so you, you've launched something, but it's pretty sort of a, a small subset with no big, exactly, it's really just okay, a proof of concept for now uh, to test things, to refine the UI, to really like get things ready, and also because we have to do things in steps, it's all not that trivial. So for example, the next big step will be to create uh, a different market making strategy for ROI poolool that will allow us to virtualize the liquidity of the base layer pool, so that's going to be a very big one, that's how we are going to be able to create uh, trading pairs for all those uh, assets that exists on chain based layer pool, but we cannot do that, like we cannot simply tap into this liquidity in an atomic fashion. So we cannot do uh, something on the app player, like a a market order in the order book, and in the background it's do a swap in the base layer pool to fill the order, the other side of the the order. It's not possible because the way to chain works to protect against me is that um, swaps on the base layer are always executed at the end of the block, and they are always ranked by a price impact from the one that has the lowest price impact to the one that I has the highest. So to achieve atomicity with uh, so we are rugger is not a layer two, like it's, it's on the same, is on to chain, this cosmos smart contract environment inside to chain, so we same share the same consensus and the same block time, however, because of this mechanics of b layer swap always happening at the end of the block, we cannot have atomicity, so we need to create this strategy where effectively you will be, it will allow people to be market maker in single-sided type of of pool. So actually, if you have Bitcoin or stable coin and you want to be help, you can do that with no e, because this strategy is just a single side, and what this strategy does is effectively uh, it it allows to provide a quot strategy will be able to estimate, okay, if let's say you have like uh, 10 U, 10k USDC, you want to buy Bitcoin, uh, the strategy will be able to say, okay, if I have 10k uh, USDC, how many Bitcoin can I get on uh, on the base layer, I would get 0.1 Bitcoin. Okay. So, I, I'm going to uh, me as a help in this strategy, I'm going to actually borrow the Bitcoin for just the duration of one block, use it, give it to you to pay to, to, so you can execute, like I can be the counterparty of your uh, swap. Yeah. And then at the end of the, I receive your USDC at, and at the end of the block, I'm going to swap those USDC back on the base layer, receive uh, the Bitcoin back, and I will have priced you a slightly worse uh, price than if you had done this swap directly on the on the order book on on the base year, because uh, I need to have a little margin in case the price I get is worse than the expected outcome, depending on what happened inside this block. And uh, and then you, you, I, I get the the bitcoin in the next block, and I can repay the loan, and so it's like an arbitrage strategy with a very tiny margin, but that you can repeat very high capital efficiency, and you can repeat block after blocks to virtualize the liquidity, 160 million of liquidity in those B layer pool into the order book, and then on top of that, we are going to add ton of new uh, strategies, so uh, things like uh, conserated liquidity uh, strategy like unis swap V3, like you define a range, and within that range you can provide, we have like, we have some a specific type of order which are called oracle orders. You can think of those as limit order, except that instead of uh, putting an order at a fixed price, you put it at a fixed uh, premium or discount to an oracle price, which in that case is the price of the base layer pool. And so that will allow us to also create alternative market making strategy. And then the goal is to create all sort of different strategies and onboard third party strategies to also come and build their strategy that will add liquidity to the order book on top of the liquidity provided by the base layer, and that will uh, effectively uh, especially with those oracle orders, you can then build a layer of strategy that trade once against another, and as long as there is volatility, everybody makes money. Uh, some people have E risk, of course, but that's a consequence of providing liquidity in pair. Yeah. And effectively all of this economic activity then creates uh, fees that are then sent.\n\n\nto ROI and to the base layer.\nSo that's the vision.\nSo it's, we are just starting with this very small subset of tokens ecosystem tokens to showcase and stress test things.\nThen a big milestone will be when we create this virtualization strategy, which is eye on the line.\nLike, I don't want to put any timing, but it's going to be the next big stuff we are going to work on once we are done like profiling the basic block we have already built.\nAnd then after that, it will be a game of adding more and more market-making strategies that live directly on the app layer to deepen the liquidity of on the order book and increase volume.\nSo, when do you think we're going to reach the nirvana of Decentralized Binance, you know, kind of running at full power?\nLike, you know, I know you don't want to put dates on things, but just, I don't know.\nJust, I guess, I'm sure like people, everybody in crypto want everything now, but I would say like it will take us probably a good year to really like, Okay.\nIt feels like a year to me too.\nYeah, because like it's a very packed, like there's a lot of things to cover and like we also want, like I mean, we have this vision.\nLike there is something I really want to implement is, so one of the key success factors of THORChain has been the affiliate model, you know, like you can just go and add a fee on top of what the protocol fee is, and it allows to, it gives a way to all sort of front ends and integrators to monetize swaps on chain.\nWe want to replicate this model, but even like more so, it's more complicated because we have a lot of different products with different types of fees.\nSo it will, it's a bit more of a challenge, but also what I want is not just an affiliate fee because the issue is the affiliate fee that you charge on top.\nIt means that nobody can be as competitive as you.\nIn our case, we have our own front end base layer and you end up like adding a cost to the end user.\nAnd we want to also have a model what I call referral fees.\nSo I make this distinction: affiliate fee is what you charge on top like to THORChain, and the referral fee will be something we take out of our revenue, but that doesn't increase the cost for the end user.\nAnd then that means we can go and if we can replicate that for all our product, like we need a generic framework, we can then start and do the same as centralized exchange, go to key opinion leaders, give them a referral codes, and then they get a kickback every time people trade with or do any sort of things on the app player with using their code without increasing the cost for the end user.\nSo, so that's quite powerful, but we can also then do that for third-party strategists, like you can build a vault, a custom vault that will add liquidity with whatever opinionated strategy you have on RUJIRA order book DEX, and then you can put a management fee and the performance fees on this vault, and then you can effectively tap into the decentralized workforce will be building, and you can have people that just go and pitch your strategy to family offices, hedge funds, whoever, and whatever TVL they can bring in, they get a cut on that for as long as this TVL remain in the vault and keep generating fees for the strategies.\nSo, it's a this type of stuff allow us to also get much closer to parity with centralized exchange.\nWe want to also add like stuff like one-click trading so you can give an authorization for a certain period of time for certain amounts to do everything in one click and then you don't have to sign every time on your ledger or on your in your wallet.\nYeah.\nLike there is, we want to build this, have this vision for Rouge Leagues.\nIt's going to be a great.\nSo everybody does point system, but we want to do that a bit differently.\nSo we'll have a point system with competition, like a six weeks periods leaderboard, but the point in the leaderboard are direct function of how much revenue you generate for the chain.\nSo we really align interest with different tier of leagues for different size of wallets because of course otherwise people who have the most capital will always be at the top.\nSo we'll have different tiers, but then it allows to create like so gamify this experience while having a way to increase economic activity in the network and reward people that use the product the most and generate the most fees.\nSo you, they effectively with via this system get back a portion of the fees.\nSo, ton of different things we want to do, but there is also like some more fundamental things that will require a dialogue with the broader THORChain community, and notably, we are talking earlier about this Bitcoin-backed stablecoin.\nThat's something I'm super excited about.\nI think this as a tremendous.\nYeah, let's talk about that.\nI'm actually really interested in that.\nSo, how would that work?\nAre you going to do like an Athena thing, like how will it work?\nSo Athena works with Aina is synthetic, like you don't have any, well you do have collateral because you have the rap stack if that is used as collateral, but then they use per markets to correct to carry trades effectively and harvest the funding yield.\nI mean, we could do something like that, but I don't think that's the optimal design because you rely on having always negative funding rate on your position.\nAnd I mean, it's worked so far.\nExactly.\nIt's worked so far, but can we, will it work like that forever in 10 years?\nLike we really tried.\nWell, the Athena people will say like even during the [ __ ] show of the terror collapse and FTX, like we had, we had two, you know, complete catastrophes in a single year and even and even then over the three-year period the carry trade did work.\nSo it's a, it's a fair point.\nI mean, we could look at something like that, but I'm I'm not sure that that's the best long-term design.\nI mean, we we could also experiment with that, but but there also the big difference with ATANA is what they use as collateral is rap stack is which itself has a yield, which even in a scenario where let's say in the long term your average return on your car trade turn towards zero, you will still have this extra yield that will cover the cost and that allows the system to self-perpetuate.\nBitcoin doesn't have yield.\nI mean, you could say that the basement of fiat currency is the yield and so the value will always increase, but it's a bit of a different design.\nSo I think at least we will start with something that is much more like a battle tested and it's a standard CDP model like MakerDAO where you can borrow up to a certain LTV and if you get below this LTV you can be liquidated and that's also give an opportunity for people to effectively participate in liquidation via or the liquidation in g and when people go to the gen and don't manage their debt position well, well it's an opportunity for other people to buy into it at a discount and redistribute the wealth.\nSo it's great, you keep the cycle going and and money transfer from impassions to patients and from people with high risk toler high risk tolerance to people with lower risk tolerance, but like all in, it's a it's healthy like to keep the cycle of boom and burst and concentration redistribution.\nSo an idea adds fun to the game, but most importantly, it's a very robust design.\nIt has been around since the very first.\nYeah, we all know how that one works.\nSo yeah, that that actually makes sense.\nSo okay, so it would probably be that, however, no matter the system, whether it's with it type of model or with a standard CDP model, the issue is THORChain is a very unique beast with when it comes to security and so you have this concept of of security budget where historically up to very recently you always need to have $2 of RUNE bonded for every $1 of assets secured by the of exogenous assets secured by the network.\nAnd that's like for a long time, like up to recently we did not have enough security budget to even launch the app layer and then it was this raise the bond campaign which your RUNE campaign I remember.\nExactly.\nSo raise the bond.\nThat was one.\nBut also they started to relax the security budget because at the end there is a lot of um hypothesis backed into this security assumption, like people who put the capital at risk are the one who put the capital at risk.\nBut it's not true because now like people can bond with operator.\nSo the operator could with a fraction of the cost go malicious anyway.\nAlso the system does not track what the average entry price of everyone.\nSo you don't know actually maybe somebody has been accumulating a ton of RUNEs already and it's just waiting for the price to go up and to rug the entire system.\nLike reality is the system is already optimistic, but without recognizing it.\nI think it's good like that people in the THORChain community have this very strong sensitivity to risk and I think a lot of people got hurt and traumatized a bit by the blow up of top five and now they they doubled down on this, but effectively if you really want to compete with all these other ecosystem, really want to scale one way or another, we'll have to go around this security budget.\nSo there are different ways of doing that.\nOne is to just go like, okay, let's become like any other blockchain like Ethereum or.\nPeople will say, \"Yeah, but this blockchain doesn't secure exogenous assets,\" which is a fair point, but you you can, it's a bit of a mind shift.\nYou can say people are not relax a little bit because we're we're probably it's like, look, we're you know, the security is not as good as we thought it was anyway.\nUm and and it's probably fine and so let's let's relax a little bit so we can hit our bonding requirements and and actually launch this thing and then let's get in the air and then then worry about fixing it later, which kind of kind of what you said.\nYeah.\nNot let's get there and worry about fixing it later.\nNo, it's more like it's a change in mindset.\nLike for example, when you buy this a stock in a company, you don't buy it because of the value of the asset on the balance sheet.\nYou buy it because of the future cash flow you expect to get from this stock.\nAnd here like with this security model, we are constraining the growth of our chain.\nAnd especially at the moment where you will need so whenever the security budget goes down you prevent new capital to enter into liquidity pool which is productive capital that allows you to generate revenue and that's the time where you will want to keep this capital and even increase it so you can increase your revenue and increase the value.\nSo it's kind of counterproductive.\nSo instead of having a backward-looking approach is to more having like a equity type of thinking where effectively what you you your basic assumption is people are here by RUNE and stack RUNE and bond RUNE because of the future cash flows they can get and let's just maximize those future cash flow and that will make RUNE more valuable as an asset and the price will go up and the security of the network will scale up, which is how most of the yeah, that makes sense and why is it important in the context of a decentralized stable coin because if you create this Bitcoin-backed stable coin, we really want it to become the major stable coin like the golden SL stable coin backed by the most pressing collateral in a purely native fashion, which is an incredible narrative.\nIt's likely going to take a lot of economic security because every time somebody come and deposit Bitcoin, it's taking some of the security budget.\nSo we'll have to either relax the security budget or some people have been suggesting like some alternative model like with cold vaults where effectively you will not have all the liquidity available right away, but you always have a buffer that you can withdraw, the rest is stored in in a external cold vault all like secured by smart contract and by the node operators.\nLike it, it adds a bit more complexity to the system and it can potentially add a delay between the moment you try to withdraw your collateral and the moment you can actually get it back on Bitcoin.\nBut maybe that's acceptable tradeoff for for security.\nBut so we will have to solve this big question if you really want to be able to scale the app layer and especially if we go with this Bitcoin-backed stable coin.\nThis is something we'll have to to to sort out and the other corollary of that is if you create this stable coin you also want to export it because right now all those assets you can import them to THORChain, but you cannot export them.\nExporting them again create a very big security conundrum because then they are outside of your ecosystem.\nSo they are not even generating fee, at least when they are in the ecosystem, they are using being used in DeFi and in theory they generate cash flow for for RUNE, but if you export them that they are being used in other ecosystem with other apps capturing the fee and you don't get anything and still you pay for the security budget of that.\nSo and if we have this stable coin we want to be able to export it massively and if we really want to win and make it a standard that you can be a big stable coin, so so there is a that's a big discussion that we need to happen and and we need to find solution around is how do we solve this security security issue, security question and and make sure we can scale that.\nBut I'm sure like there are technical way to do that.\nWe just need to reach both a technical and a social consensus around how we tackle that and and then the sky is the limit.\nLike I mean it's so appealing.\nAll right, PM, we're coming up on the hour here, so I'm going to wrap it up.\nUm, where is there anything that I didn't cover that you thought I should have should have asked first of all?\nNo, no, really.\nI think we went through a lot of, we could, we could speak about, we could go for another two hours.\nI know we can't, we must end the show.\nSo, yeah.\nAnd how where can people find you on X and you know what are your websites and where can people find the products that you have launched so far such as they are?\nYeah.\nSo, so our next, I'm PragmaticMonkey, easy to find and for the product, like best place is just go to rujira.network or find us at Rujira Network on X.\nUh, join our Telegram.\nUh, that's where most of the community is.\nIf you are more of a dev, you want to build, so you are very welcome.\nWe are trying to onboard a lot of different builders.\nSo you can be in touch directly with me.\nUh, and the best place to do that is also either Telegram or you can join our dev discord and that works as well.\nAnd yeah, just very excited to get a lot of people from the THORChain community.\n\n\nTo start using our products once we scale a bit the liquidity.\nAnd uh, I'd be happy to come back, like there's still a ton of stuff we could have covered.\nSo happy to come back another time to uh, maybe even walk through the products once uh, we'll have a bit more to show and uh, and show, show you firsthand uh, what it looks like and uh, maybe I'll send you a bit of fun and you will play with it and uh, and you tell me in live what you think of it.\nThat would be fun.\nYeah.\nNo, I'd love that.\nI'd love that.\nAnd uh, and thank you so much for coming on today.\nHey, I mean, as I mentioned, I'm a TCY holder, so I am, I am very interested in what you guys are doing because because I make a little bit of that, right?\nSo, of course, I'm happy to hear about the about all this progress.\nSo, thank you.\nAnd by the way, you, you have the opportunity to use your TCY also in the app layer.\nSo, we have already built an auto compounder, one of the the team.\nSo, if you want to just stack and and increase your TCY position, you can.\nAnd if you want to trade it, get out in another book at a certain price, you will be able to do that as well.\nSo, ton of things you will be able to do with your TCY.\nWe are increasing the utility.\nSo, not only just increasing the cash flow, but also the utility of what you can do with it.\nSuper cool.\nAll right, everybody.\nMy name is Mark Jeffrey.\nThis has been Hash Rate.\nWe'll see you all next time.\n",
