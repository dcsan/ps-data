  "cleanText": "Hello everybody, welcome to Hash Rate.\nUh, my guest today is Max Sebti of the SCORE Computer Vision Subnet 44.\nHello Max.\nHow you doing?\nHey Mark.\nThanks for having me.\nI'm doing really well.\nSuper excited to be, you know, featured on your show.\nThat that's great.\nI mean at last, right?\nI mean you're a major subnet and I'm sorry it took me so long to get to you and I I feel I feel somewhat embarrassed that uh that uh Scoble got to you before I did.\nHe's good on that.\nHe was good on that.\nYeah, definitely.\nYeah.\nWell, I mean, Scoville, I mean, he's been around.\nI don't know if Did you know who he was before uh before you went on the show?\nI mean, he's he's got a large account and I mean, he's super respected.\nSo, I was I was kind of impressed to be featured like so so quickly on on on his channel.\nBut that that was a great conversation.\nI I also um noticed that you also went and talked to him about the tens.\nI did.\nI did, but you you kicked open the door.\nI got to be honest.\nI mean I've known Scobble I mean sort of I've known Scobble since like uh 2007, 2008.\nI was CTO of Mahalo where Jason KCanis was the CEO, right?\nSo there's like a four-year stretch where um you know the the Mahalo offices were sort of like Warhol's loft where like you know Elon was walking in the front door, this person, that person, like anyone who was sort of note in that era was in that office more or less continuously including like celebrities and you know it it was it Pretty awesome to be in that office, I have to say, looking back now, right?\nSo, um, you know, at the time I was working my ass off, so it didn't feel as awesome as it actually was if I just stood up and smelled the flowers a little bit more, right?\nSo, um, but nonetheless, uh, but so Sculp used to come in the offices and we got to know each other, but I was, you know, I was a CTO.\nI wasn't like the founder or something like that.\nSo, you know, he he vaguely knew who I was.\nAnd then on X more recently, we started interacting a lot more because I have a vision pro and I'm a vision pro afficionado as is he, right?\nSo that's sort of, you know, so that's where the love started.\nThen you went on his show, right?\nSo he's been seeing me post about Bit Tensor now for like the last year, but sort of like I don't know what that is.\nIt's some crypto thing.\nI don't care.\nThen you went on his show and then I started, you know, pointing out like, hey, look, Scoble's paying attention to a subnet.\nAnd then he reached out to He's like, \"Hey, I can you you want to come on and explain like what this is?\"\nSo, so thank you.\nSo, I have to give you credit for that.\nGood job.\nAppreciate I appreciate this.\nYeah.\nAnd also, thanks for what you're doing for the system.\nI mean, that that's amazing to have such platforms.\nWell, thank you.\nI appreciate it.\nAll right, let's jump into what you're doing here.\nSo, the optic nerve of AI, you're basically solving computer vision.\nUh, but I I what I like about what you're doing, I want you to tell me, you know, what I'm getting right here and what I'm not.\nUm, so it's, you know, broadly computer vision, but you were focusing on a you're crossing the chasm, as they say, like you're you're segmenting the market into something with revenue that you can get at right now, and that is supplying sports teams with intelligence, kind of like a moneyball thing um about their team.\nSo tell us what you're doing.\nYeah.\nNo, that's uh I think I mean that's pretty much that.\nBut um um I I think there's a there's a very strong reason why we we started with with football and I mean soccer and sports is because we identify that as a new team on Bittensor we had to be very focused on proving that we could use the tech to then go to market and you know really make something out of out of of out of the subnet.\nSo we we were I mean we're still extremely well connected in this world but we also actually realized that the main problem in sports at the moment is is on the Data Annotation end.\nUm so it's very hard for people to upload a video somewhere online and get Data Annotation, you know, in a very accurate way, fast way, and also in an affordable way.\nSo we we started with this in mind.\nObviously we had this customer um you know sports hedge fund trying to work with us and use our data and and and also our AI capabilities to get to better insights I would say.\nBut the very very very first problem we had to solve to kind of come on Bittensor and brag about being the optic nerve of AI was to find a good way to annotate data.\nSo if I take you through the actual tech we're trying to build it's it's it's pretty simple.\nIt's in three steps and all the companies that are using video and and and you know as core of their operations are you know go kind of go through this process.\nSo what you need to do when you want to handle video you know at scale and and build models and train models on top of of the video is you have to annotate the data first.\nIt's a three-step process.\nYou annotate the data, then you understand what's happening you know on the screen.\nSo it calls it.\nSo the first step is called tracking you know you can I'm sorry can I stop you there?\nSo when you say annotate what does that mean specifically?\nIs it like eight players um you know one of them is running towards the net like tell me what that Yeah.\nYeah.\nSorry about that.\nSo when when I say tracking data or annotation it's literally coordinates.\nSo you want to know that a player has been moving from you know one side of the pitch to the other side of the pitch that the ball has been moving in a certain way or that the corner flag is actually not moving but you know located at a very specific point you know on the pitch.\nSo that's the first step.\nSo it's purely coordinates uh and and flagging you know the different type of objects or characters people athletes yada yada yada.\nSo that's the first step.\nSo that this is what we call annotation.\nThen you need to run neuron neural networks, different architectures to understand events.\nSo you know has a player scored a goal, you know, has a player, you know, injury themselves.\nAnd this is more like this is deeper than just tracking what's happening on the screen.\nIt's you you get to get to a point where you let the machine understand exactly you know the type of event that you know is happening on the on the pitch.\nAnd then there's a third step and this is how we build our tech is when you have historical data uh and you and you annotate it and then you run neural networks through the data then what you can do is you can try to find predictability.\nSo you run inference basically on the data you collected and uh train the model on so that you could ingest real-time data.\nSo that's the that's the last that's that's you know that's the peak.\nThat's what you want to achieve is you want your tech to be able to be smart enough to send you insights or share insights in real time.\nWhen you say share insights, are you trying to predict the future or are you just analyzing what you're seeing?\nSo both.\nSo you you're analyzing what you see but then you try to predict the next frame.\nSo it's not it's it's it's a very short you know uh version of the future.\nis the next frame.\nAnd it's and it's critical because every time an object is moving frame by frame, you can deduct what's what's likely to happen.\nUm, and this is why it's so critical because you can think about obviously sports, you can think about robotics, self-driving cars, drones, yada yada yada.\nVery interesting.\nSo, okay.\nSo when you when you set up these competitions um well actually let's let's talk about what this the sports teams are paying you for this right now, right?\nSo uh that all sounds kind of awesome, you can understand what you're seeing um how do I benefit from that like how do I how do I make more money as a sports team by using this data or I guess win more?\nSo I would say so yeah the the first customers are like sports hedge funds so sports data companies uh and teams we are working with them.\nSo uh the difference is is simple.\nSo when you're like a sports team, what you want to do is you want to be more efficient with your Recruitment.\nSo the first use case is Scouting.\nSo you actually don't need real-time data for Scouting, you know, purposes.\nBut the funny thing is you start with Scouting and if you really trust the system, you run the same process in game and then you have a very strong management tool because it's actually the same thing.\nYou're scoring a player, you're scoring a system, you're scoring a formation, you're scoring, you know, you can score different things with, you know, getting data through this um workflow.\nUm the sports uh companies like hedge funds or, you know, betting syndicates, what they want to do is basically uh find an edge.\nAnd the reason they think our approach is interesting is because we control everything from the video footage to the insights and we are literally creating new data sets.\nSo with this within this new data, they think they would find new edges um and also they think they would benefit from being able to analyze real-time data because they would be able also to place bets in game.\nUh so that's why they're so excited about that if that makes sense.\nYeah.\nNo.\nOkay.\nSo that that does make sense.\nSo with the with the Scouting I guess the efficiency is is that you can understand a vast amount of video very quickly.\nUm whereas you know without you guys so let's play the game of it's a wonderful life right remember the plot where you know the plot is we remove George from the timeline right and then you know then we see like the mess that would have happened without him right so without you guys in the picture what do these sports teams what what what what's their alternative universe look like?\nSo, so what they do right now, so um it's it's it's there's an asymmetry.\nSo if you have if you're like a top team and you have a lot of money, you have access to strong platforms, uh but you don't have access to like low tier, you know, leagues, you have like good data for good teams, good players, and you end up paying players very, you know, at a very high price because for players to get on your radar, you know, they probably have to perform pretty well at a high level.\nUh so what they have right now is platforms with like hours of videos but it's it's not automated.\nThey have to hire a lot of scouts to go through the data and then travel to see the players and so it's very expensive.\nIt's manual.\nIt's human you know it's human based but you you still need human beings in in this process.\nBut I would say the the filtering parts of the of the job is is is is a heavy lift.\nUm and it's getting worse when you go down through the leagues.\nSo, if you're like a semi-pro club or even like a low-level club in Europe um for instance, you don't have you don't have enough uh resources to get access to Scouting data.\nSo what you're trying to do is you're trying to uh pay platforms like 6TV or Huddle uh and you have to go through like tens of thousands of hours of videos and maybe by chance finding some someone who would fit with your uh your system but also you don't have any capabilities to really share with the market that one of your players.\nSo if you're like a low low-level club, if you have a good player and if your business model is based on selling your good players to top clubs, you don't really have a marketplace to do that.\nYou have to know everyone.\nYou have to be connected to agents.\nYou have to be connected to top clubs.\nWhat we're trying to do and what we're trying to bring is a way for the for a whole for a whole industry to get the data together, create like a whole data set regardless of the video quality too because it's very important.\nMo most of top clubs are working with 4K cameras.\nSo everything is perfect but they actually create systems that are not really resilient.\nSo what we're trying to do is we're trying to create a system where even with low-level quality video we would be able to find gems.\nUm so we structure all the data and then we make sure that everyone can query the the data basically and the heavy lift for us is to create a scoring system that would be trusted across all leagues and then you would create a standard where people would be able to even film their kids playing soccer and they would go and be uploaded into this data set and maybe fit with other self Scouting right you're like my kid's pretty good.\nSo, I'm gonna take some video use case.\nSorry.\nGo ahead.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, I'm gonna take some video of my kid and upload it to this Scouting, you know, universe and and and hopefully somebody will, you know, the system will agree that he's a good player and that'll kick up, you know, be like, \"Hey, I found a guy.\"\nYeah.\nOr or a woman.\nI don't want to say it's again necessarily.\nSo, yeah.\nCould be anybody.\nSo, yeah.\nOkay.\nWow.\nSo uh so so basically the big clubs have the dollars to use the big AI right so I imagine some of the big clubs are already using sort of big AI\nyeah some of them are working with Palanteer, some of them are working with um OpenAI, Anthropic.\nI mean they could they can throw money out on the table so it's uh it's not really a problem for them um as long as you keep good quality video so I think there's there's a there's this I would say ceiling and then yeah they still have the same problem to kind of find gems at lower levels\nYeah, but you make it accessible to the, you know, to sort of the Long Tail Sports Clubs, right?\nLike your your your expenses are quite a bit less or you're charging quite a bit less, right?\nDo you have an what what is sort of the delta between you?\nYeah, definitely.\nSo, so and by the way, this is very interesting because our thesis is SCORE should be addressing the long tail of all the companies entities that would need to leverage computer vision but they wouldn't get you know they wouldn't have the resources to do it.\nSo that this is a very strong point you just mentioned.\nUm, so if you compare, so I'm not going to mention any specific clubs, but\n\n\nMost of the top-level clubs are spending between one and $3 million per year on scouting data, data analytics, and scouting. You know, um, data. So, if you think about something like SCORE Computer Vision, we would do it at like a hundredth of the price.\n\nA hundredth of a price. Oh my god.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, because that is insane, actually. So, that's the biggest delta I've heard yet of any Bittensor product. So, I've been looking at, you know, Hippius is, you know, I think it's like 1/40th of the price or something like that, which is amazing.\n\nWhich is amazing in itself, right? So, for storage, that's for that's a storage. It's sort of like Filecoin for those who don't know. I mean, the reason being, the reason being is Hippius is, is, um, competing against other already automated solutions, yada yada. We're competing against human-centric annotations. So, that that's the reason why we can reach that level because we are automating something that is usually done by human beings.\n\nOkay, so now you're, and I love the fact that you're generating revenue right away, and you're doing a lot of, like, you're acting like a real company, right? You're acting like a grown-up, which I love. I love the Bittensor hippie kind of vibe, too. I mean, I think there's something great. I mean, Bitcoin's got that same vibe, right? So, that's awesome, also. Um, but also acting like a real company is awesome as well. And I think if you combine the two of those, you have something extremely powerful, right? Best of both worlds. Um, you're making revenue right now. Have you talked about how much revenue you're making?\n\nUm, not yet. So, we've been talking about our first customer, the sports hedge fund. So, we have a deal with them. We're going to take 20% of the upside of what to generate with the money. There's no downside. Uh, but obviously, it's something fee-based. So, we would, I think, the only way people would realize the amount of money generated is going to be through buybacks. Um, and that's going to be for us the easiest way to prove me that revenue is kicking in.\n\nUm, by buyback, you mean you're going to buy your own subnet?\n\nYeah, Subnet 44, um, tokens. Um, also, yeah, so we've been, uh, I mean, discussing, negotiating. So, we are really close to getting, like, you know, record revenue, uh, from different clubs or sports entities, let's say. Uh, but I don't want to, I don't want to sell vaporware. So, we would announce things when they happen, again, behaving like a normal, uh, grown-up company. So, I love that. Um, and so the total addressable market, I read somewhere in your materials, is, uh, 600 billion. I guess that's, that's all of football.\n\nNo. Yeah, that's all football.\n\nSo, not really your total addressable market.\n\nUm, I, no. So, that's very interesting because, um, obviously, we have. So, it's funny because we're at the intersection of two different markets. Um, the first one is obviously sports analytics, and you can, you can add betting there because they're just paying for data. It's pretty much the same thing.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh, it's, it's, it's already a big enough market for us. Our TAM on that market would be close to 1.5 billion, our, our TAM, not just the entire market.\n\nGot it.\n\nUm, if we talk about something else, which something I'm passionate about, which is Data Annotation. What we have to realize is, actually, what we are doing with sports can be done with other types of, you know, industries, and then the market would be completely different. We would be competing against a company like Scale, for instance, uh, on the video end of the annotation. And for people who probably don't know, they've just been acquired, like, north of, like, 30 billion by Meta.\n\nYes. Uh, which is exciting because it's a big number. But what is exciting, too, is that, obviously, since they're now working with Meta, a lot of the tech companies are not working with them anymore. So, it's, it's opening up a huge market share. But anyway, so I, I don't want to, again, I, I can sell the dream. I'm very passionate. We're very passionate about what we do, but we're going to be focused on the next six months to really start selling products in the sports market and hopefully generate as much revenue as possible.\n\nIs there any sort of, um, worry? I, I was listen, I was actually been listening to, um, uh, some of the other podcasts that Siam has been doing, like, you know, basically Hash Rate, but like sort of a micro version of it that he calls Revenue Search, and he's been doing, like, you know, one a day, sometimes two a day, right? So, he's, he's going a lot faster than I am. I like, I like doing the deeper dives, but he's like 15 minutes, and one of the things that that popped out, I was watching the one with, um, Gradients last night, and they were talking about how, um, in order to sell their product to enterprise customers, there's this sort of reluctance because what the subnet is doing is they're giving it the data that is to be ingested to, uh, miners, and we don't, you know, who knows who the miners are, right? They could be anybody. So, people, so the, the perspective customers are like, well, we trust you, Gradients guys, we don't trust these 256 miners that aren't doxxed, we don't know who they are. Is there any sort of hesitation, do you think, in your world with the data that you're crunching, or does that just kind of not exist?\n\nUh, no. So, this is a very interesting, uh, question, and that's the reason why we decided to work with a, with one key partner. We've announced that we've been working with 6TV on getting the data. Uh, the reason we did this is because they know that what we're doing on Bittensor right now, and they're very excited about this new AI capability. So, we kind of solve this problem by, you know, by signing the right type of agreement with one key data provider. Um, it's a positive, but it's also negative. The negative part of that is, obviously, it's less of a decentralized type of play. So, you know, we, we had to know who's going to, you know, everyone knows who's providing the data. But the good part is everything is done in a very clean way. We're not trying to acquire data by, you know, scrape scrapping it here and there, or, you know, going behind the customer's back. So, and the funny thing is, because football is, uh, soccer, sorry, in Europe, is kind of democratized type of game, they already have access to law leagues, semipro, so it was a way for us to really do it in a clean way from a data perspective. I don't know if, if it, if it's a good answer, but this is what we're trying to do.\n\nYeah. No, no, it's a great answer. Uh, it's, it's, I think it's probably less applicable to you guys, but I, I wasn't, wasn't sure, and I know it's, it, it keeps coming up, like, I keep hearing that as a worry for people to, um, why they don't like Bittensor, why they actually like the centralized services, right? So, um, yeah, I mean, if I don't have to talk about school, because obviously, I'm, I'm, I'm more, if I'm honest with you, I'm more passionate about Bittensor itself than just my own subnet, if that makes sense. Um, uh, we're, we're extremely well connected with hedge funds and financial institutions, and actually, this is the main problem. So, the reason we see probably less hedge funds on Bittensor right now is because we don't have a way to protect, or maybe we have a way, but it's not democratized enough yet, or, you know, shared with, you know, the whole ecosystem. But yeah, we will probably need to work on something as a, from an ecosystem perspective. Well, my understanding is that both Chutes and Targon are working on trusted execution environments, right? Which that's the, that's the solution where basically that data is now obfuscated. Even though you're mining, you don't know what's going on inside your minor, right? And in terms of the data anyway, you don't know exactly what's going on, which I don't know how that, you know, does that prevent people from tweaking it effectively? I don't know. But maybe we should ask, we should ask them. I'm not sure about that brains. I'm just a football fan.\n\nI'm just a football fan. I don't know. I don't know how these bits and bats and fancy technology works. I just love my football. Yeah. No, nothing wrong with that.\n\nSo, um, okay. So, I, you know, the one of the things that comes up on X, you know, I've, I've now sort of started encountering the Borg or the trolls on X now that I sort of stuck my neck out in support of Bittensor, and I'm talking a lot about TAO, right? So, one of the sort of themes that has arisen lately is, um, you know, every mining pool can be replaced with a colo facility, you know, why, what's to prevent subnets once they achieve scale or real-world success from just kind of looking at their token, their subnet token and ecosystem and miners and going, you know what, [ __ ] all those people and those guys and those token holders, I'm just going to set up my own mining rigs and just mine it all myself, and actually, I'm not going to even pay attention to the token. I'm just going to pay attention to my equity and and make that bigger and bigger and bigger. Do you think that's a danger? And what do you think about that?\n\nSo, that, that's definitely a risk. Um, I think we're probably going to see some teams doing this. Um, I don't even really know what would prevent people from doing this. Uh, I would just say that it would completely break the very reason why we started a subnet in the first place. Um, I think we should always see Bittensor as like an ongoing, you know, flywheel where we would always be state of the art, uh, and I think, to be honest with you, I think the incentive for businesses to always be state of the art is probably bigger because, I mean, the air race is moving at a pace, and even if as a team you feel like you've reached a level where you find you can keep selling your product, you don't know if in, like, in, in, in a few weeks time or months time, OpenAI is not going to go and bring something way faster, more efficient at what you're doing. And then if you break the relationship with your miners and with your, you know, with your ecosystem, then you, you are stuck because no one would trust you, you know, anymore, and your product is going to be stuck, too. Um, I don't know if I can say this, but I would definitely say it. So, we're trying to raise money at the moment. Um, we, we're not just trying, we're raising money at the moment, and, um, basically what we say, so, we, we, we are stating different things, um, because for us, it's very important, first, everything we do is around being, uh, a subnet like a company running a subnet. So, our north star is to push our dTAO in the subnet. Um, obviously, internally, we have a target, you know, from a ranking perspective, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to jinx it. I'm not going to talk about that. Um, and the second thing we say is, um, everyone who would jump on board, uh, from an investment perspective, would have equity and a token warrant, and if the company goes one way or the other, uh, everyone would benefit from that. So, we couldn't, we couldn't move away from the subnet, basically, that's what I'm trying to say. Yes. Um, so investors know that the subnet for us is core and center, and we would be crazy not to think about it this way because how could you kickstart something like SCORE, literally save half a million a month in compute and, you know, salaries, because that's pretty much what's happening, and then just move away when, you know, oh, we're good, we're okay, thank you guys, you just, you know, funded our business, but now we're good, and we're going to go. I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't be able to go to bed or wake up and see myself in the mirror.\n\nYeah. So, it's not just like you, you're being loyal to your subnet because, you know, you have this hippie sort of afficionado vibe with Bittensor. It's actually very practical, right? So, you, you, you could not have booted up this business. You basically got 256 people that are working for you for free.\n\nYeah. It's crazy to move away from that just from a business perspective, right? And there. So, and you're saving, I guess you said half a, half a million dollars, right? That, I don't know what over what time frame, but whatever. It's, it's significant per month.\n\nPer month.\n\nOh my god. Okay. So, millions per year. Six million a year. Enough to build a bionic man, right? In the 70s anyway. So, that's a lot, right? So, um, and, and, and so that, that's, and but even when you get out of the boot-up phase, those same people that are working for you for free, and we'll get into what that means exactly in a second, because I, I do want to push this point for people who don't understand this. Um, they will be the people, those pe, those 256 miners are very clever people from all over the world who are continuously working to tweak what they're doing for you to make it better and better and better and better so that they earn more Bittensor TAO tokens and and your subnet token, right? So, um, to make, you know, basically make money, and this is the key point. So, the idea is that TAO, as TAO becomes more and more valuable, right? So, you got something that's sort of like a Bitcoinish thing. It worked once, so we're trying to do it again, but with different rules for the miners. Um, so, theoretically, TAO becomes more and more valuable over time, like Bitcoin did. And so far, it has. Um, so all the 256 miners in each subnet, not just yours, are working like monkeys to try to figure out how to get more of it faster early on, right? Because right now the getting is good. It's like mining Bitcoin in 2013. Oh my god, how much can you mine? Right? That, that's now it's worth $112,000 as of today, right? Like, if you just get it early and hold on to it, you're going to make out like a, like a bandit, right? So, and for companies, this basically, this dynamic, this Bitcoin-like dynamic results in free labor and free GPU, right? So, and and free smarts.\n\nYeah.\n\nRight. Free brains attacking a problem. I mean, that's, that's a proof of intelligence.\n\nYes. So, I would say, and, and\n\n\nIt keeps you hanging around you like when you think about leaving, you're like, \"Well, I don't know because I lose all those brains, I lose all, I lose all those GPU, I lose all that cost savings. Why would I do that? That's dumb.\" So that's the answer. Yes.\n\nYeah, that's the answer. And also, um, I've, I've been talking with VCs from the valley, um, and we've been talking, you know, back and forth about the tensor, you know, web two AI research labs, um, and at some point, we talked about a team. I don't know if we can name them, but they had a subnet, and then they decided to run their own token, um, and basically, even VCs from the valley told me, \"I don't know why would you do this?\" Because you, being the two, so to two token system, or you...\n\nNo, no, just moving out. So having a, having a subnet first, and then like throwing the subnet away and launching, you know, um, and, and they, and they were telling me, \"It's just crazy. You, you, you access to a legit AI research lab. There's an incentive mechanism that is, you know, proving that people are pushing your tech, and you would try just for maybe, you know, good, bad reasons, move away from this and, and then just throw that away.\" I mean, even for them, that was like such a weird and almost dumb move. So I think for teams that would be thinking like this, they should probably think twice. I think that's not a very good idea.\n\nThat's a great answer. Thank you. And I'm gl, I'm glad we explored this because that, that, that this question comes up a lot on X. I've had a number of people sort of come at me with it. And so I think it's great that, you know, you're a very, you're a button-down, real-world company, right? Like, like, if this were, if, if it made more sense for you to just ditch your subnet and take off, go running down the road that way, you'd do it. Like, I have no doubt.\n\nThat's what I'm trying to say. So I'm very, very, you know, like, revenue oriented and also profit oriented, and I'm telling you that having a subnet is way better than trying to be an AI research lab in web two or trying to do like another token on another chain or whatever.\n\nYeah, I've actually, I've heard this before. So I have a friend named Fred Krueger. Yes, that's his real name. I don't know if you've heard of that guy or not.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe's, he's an old friend of mine. He's sort of a Bitcoin maxi who's now become, you know, very, he runs a subnet now. So, he runs Subnet 90, and he's got a site called Den Predict, and it's pretty much longtail Poly Market, right? You can't, you and I can't go make our own markets on Poly Market, but what if we could? That's DGen predict. So, now there's, you know, at scale, millions of markets, right? So, how do you judge who won, right? Like, some of them are going to be very difficult. The only way to really judge it at scale is to have an AI adjudicate what happened, right? And, and, and so his subnet, Subnet 90, is AI adjudication of a poly market-like system.\n\nAnd, and it turns out doing that is really hard, right? Because of the hallucination problems and how the bet, betting market was stated, right? So getting it, getting it right is actually quite difficult. And so, uh, so his subnet is that, the, the referees, um, and, and I, I asked him, I said, \"Why don't you just do, you know...\" and he's running, he, I know he's running, um, he's a big AI researcher guy on his own. He, like, just loves tinkering with it. So he's bought computers where he's running AI models, and he's like, \"Oh my god, it's got this box, knows the all of human knowledge. You can ask it anything, and it's in this box. That's it.\" It blows his mind, and he loves playing around with it, right? So I'm like, and he's the kind of guy that would just do it himself. I'm like, \"Why, Fred? Why don't you just screw this Biter stuff? Why don't you just go do it with your little box in your office that knows all of human history and just make that better?\" And he's like, \"Well, because I have 256 researchers that are smarter at this stuff than I will ever be, and they're competing with each other to grab coin, this Bitcoin-like coin. Um, I, I just, they're just going to be better at it than I am, and they're going to move faster. So, of course, I'm going to do this, right?\" So, yeah.\n\nCool. Thanks.\n\nI'm glad I'm hearing a consistent answer from people. So, okay, let's talk now a little bit about Bittensor in general.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, um, you've been watching the subnet. Subnets have been out now, what is it, 140 days-ish at this point? Maybe 150 days.\n\nDTO.\n\nYeah, DTO. Yeah. So, yeah, sorry. It's DTO I'm talking about, not subnets in general.\n\nUm, where, and this is a system whereby each subnet has its own token, and that token, and there's basically like this uniswap-like thing built directly into the chain itself where you are, you're, you're not required to stake TAO, but should you, should you choose to accept your mission. Your mission is there's 128 subnets. Take your TAO, stake it for subnet tokens, and each, and you, you stake TAO, and you get subnet tokens back, and the idea is that hopefully that subnet token will be become worth a lot, and when you trade out of it with the chain itself or unstake, there's a lot more TAO in there, and it's worth a lot more, right? That's the game.\n\nSo, and, and if you choose right, you could make, you could like 10x your stack. I mean, this is not financial advice, but just sort of theoretically. Um, you, you might 10x your stack. I've seen people 10x their stacks by doing this.\n\nBut if you choose wrong, you could lose everything. You could lose all your TAO, like, it just, if that subnet becomes worthless. Oh, your TAO is now worthless that you put in there or that someone else put in there.\n\nWhat do you think about this system? Is it working as expected? There, there's been a lot of sort of views on this. What are you, your views on DTAO and whether it's working as expected or not?\n\nYeah, I mean, that's, that's a fair question, but, um, I have to say, uh, and I've been talking to F sometimes, to other people, other subnet owners about that. I'm, I'm, I'm a kind of pragmatic type of guy. So, first of all, I want to say it is what it is. But, but, um, yeah, but so we have to play within, you know, the, the rules. Uh, I think there's, there's a positive side of it, there's a negative side of it. I think the positive side of it is it's set up to bring attention, and it's set up to bring liquidity, and I think it's a positive because basically, I think that's the best fuel for growth that Bittensor could, you know, could get. Uh, I'm talking to people from other ecosystem, from Solana, from ETH, um, and everyone agrees that this kind of launchpad kind of thing where you can pick your poison and you can, you know, vouch for teams and push people to follow you. I mean, that, that's exciting in itself. Um, reality is, I think we were the pre-detail world was super easy, I would say, to navigate, and it was just based on your ability to advertise your subnet to a very small audience.\n\nNow the game is very much complex because you have to be a legit AI team. You have to be good at marketing. You have to go on podcasts and explain yourself, and people asking questions about revenue. Uh, some subnets are extremely good, but they're not going to generate revenue in the next few months. So are we talking about the right metric? So it's, it's, it's complex, and it, and it brought complexity on top of something that was already complex. So I would say the negative point is even before detail, it was hard to explain Bittensor to people, and they were like, \"It's kind of an AI web3 thing, but the chain actually is more, you know, to handle the incentive mechanism than it is to, you know, process AI on chain.\" So it was already like a long type of conversation where you, you had to talk about Bittensor, and now, I mean, but you did it pretty, pretty in, in a pretty beautiful way, but now you, you also have to to explain detail, so sub tokens, um, you, you have to explain the fact that, you know, you can buy or sell, but actually, you don't buy or sell, you stake your own stake.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo that, that's that. So I would say that the, the, uh, but I like that because it created a new market, created almost like a new economy, and, and honestly, behind detail, you can almost feel, you know, const, uh, character, because, you know, it's like, \"You guys now do it,\" and it's in your hands, and I like it because it's, it's just a good game. Uh, but it's tough. It's really tough. I mean, being a subnet owner is, is tricky, definitely.\n\nYeah. I feel like, um, every time, it's funny what you say about Kch, because I feel like, um, when I first heard about how it was going to work, I, I, I sort of had like a couple weeks where I was like, \"Why the [ __ ] are they doing it? This, this is the weirdest thing. I've never seen anything like this.\" Like, there are a lot of like what appeared to be bizarre choices, right? And I was like, \"Oh, [ __ ].\" These are like AI wonky guys sitting in a tower somewhere, and they're trying to do, you know, they're trying to do things like what they do on ETH and Solana, but they have to do it in this weird way. And the more I sort of sat with it, the more, and actually, it was wasn't until I started playing with it that I sort of got this feeling of, \"Oh, that's actually far more clever than I thought it was,\" you know, as I'm now using it, right? And in particular, the, the way, you know, building the exchange into the chain itself, that was kind of weird, right? Staking to get things. That was kind of weird. But I realized that, \"Oh, this is driving value to TAO,\" right? Whether it doesn't matter which subnet tokens go up, as long as some of them do, right? As long as we have some winners, the value of TAO gets dragged up with everything, right? It's like a index fund of of all the subnets, right? Uh, or, or the best of the subnets, right? Maybe is a better way to say it.\n\nUm, but also in particular, I love the fact that, um, as someone who sometimes has advanced knowledge of things, um, because of the way the liquidity boots up inside of the subnet pools, which are baked into the chain, uh, it, you know, knowledge of the future gives you no advantage.\n\nYeah. It's, you know, it's like you're, you're on the level playing field with everyone else, which is extremely different from the Solana and Ethereum universes, right? Where insiders dumped on the people who came lately, right, or later. That's just like, that, that dynamic is completely been defeated. And I love that. That is...\n\nRight. And it's a completely new mechanism that I've never seen anyone else do before. Right. So, they weren't afraid to sort of do new things. And the more I sit with it, the more I really love it. Um, my, my gripe has been continuously, you know, the root is too damn high. However, as of this podcast, the root is no longer too damn high. It's now settled into like around 10%, which I still think is a little too high, but that's like reasonable, right? That's not like crazy like the way it was. So, I think it's sort of forcing people out of root. Uh, we're at like 9% now that are in of TAO that's in subnets.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd it's, you know, it's climbing. I mean, part of that climbing is because of emissions, but, but part of it is because more people are, are actually going into subnets. So, um, it, the, the system appears to be getting healthier with every single day, and I think it sort of was unclear whether it was healthy in the beginning, but I think it's, it looks healthy to me now. So...\n\nYeah, I share the same impression, and, uh, and I've been asked directly by people if I wanted to change root cell pressure or stuff like that, and my answer was, \"We should pick our battle. I think we should all work harder to bring new liquidity.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nRather than try to change the game now for now, because I think 140 days or, you know, 150 days, that's not enough for us to really grasp, you know, the core concept behind that. So, yeah, I mean, it's been set up to bring liquidity. So let's try to just join forces, uh, all together and make sure we can bring fresh liquidity and, uh, and get people to get attent to, to, to pay attention to TAO, basically.\n\nYeah. No, I totally agree with you, and I've seen, I've seen some things that I can't talk about, um, that, that I think are going to launch pretty soon, which will, will basically bridge the Solana, Ethereum, and Base universes. And I've seen several things, and all of the things I've seen are [ __ ] awesome.\n\nAmazing.\n\nAnd I, I'm super excited for the world to see it. And I think that if the sort of the Solana and Ethereum and Base worlds see this and, and sort of get what they're looking at, uh, and get that the market caps of the subnets right now versus, um, you know, the venture-backed corollaries are just way out of whack, like, in a, in a good way, which provides a lot of opportunity. I think we will see a bunch of liquidity flood in, just in, just in retail, but also the hedge funds and, you know, there's an, there's an awful large number of entities which are now booting up for institutional...\n\nThat is, I think about to enter, specifically in the subnets, and I'm, I'm hearing that like from every direction, and I'm, you know, one, one of, you know, I was talking with a guy who works with ARCA at an event, like, maybe a month ago, and he, he was basically telling me that, like, you know, the only sort of coin, one, one of the coins that they, that they just get requested information on continuously is TAO, because a lot of people don't know how to get into it, right? Like, it's weird and hard to get into, so they're like, \"How do I get into these subnets? Like, where's the front door, and how do I get in?\" Right? You just don't go to Coinbase and buy, shoots, not yet.\n\nI've been talking to some, to some tier one exchanges that are trying to list subnet tokens, but, um, it's, it's a journey because of the tech tech choices that have been made, but it, I'm sure it's going to happen pretty much soon. And I agree with you. We've been at, we had conversations with a lot of hedge funds in...\n\n\nNew York mainly.\nSo my business partner Nigel is currently in New York, and everyone was trying to buy TAO.\nAnd yeah, that that's funny.\nEven our data science main person, who's a chief data scientist for a large hedge fund, I think the most amount of money he managed was north of 20 billion.\nHe just met one of his neighbors in Connecticut, a guy who runs a hedge fund, and he realized that he was long SCORE, and he connected with his neighbor, and his neighbor was like, \"Yeah, of course, BitTensor.\nSo my biggest bug is on SCORE.\"\nAnd anyway, so that's funny.\nSo yeah, I agree with you.\nEveryone in the finance world, hedge fund world, is talking about TAO.\nAnd it's crazy to hear something that we can think of, you know, of being like a bit naive, which is we missed Bitcoin, we could jump on TAO.\nIt's a very, very naive statement.\nWe're in crypto when you're in crypto.\nBut actually, I'm hearing this from a lot of finance people.\nThey really believe that it's the case.\nSo that's funny.\nI think that's going to bring a lot of liquidity.\nOh, I think it's the case.\nAnd I was there for Bitcoin in 2013, right?\nLike when the price was exactly what TAO's price is right now, and I was watching, I started watching that chart, the Bitcoin chart, like a hawk, like daily.\nLike I start, I started chart watching in 2013, right?\nSo it's now, what are we, 2025?\nI got, I got like, you know, so uh, 12 years, 13 years, whatever the [ __ ] that is.\nI can't do math.\nUh, worth of chart watching daily in my head, and I watched Bitcoin kind of go, and then I watched Ethereum basically track almost exactly what Bitcoin did.\nThen it diverged.\nUm, uh, but it was, but I, I know what those charts look like.\nTAO looks just like early Bitcoin and early Ethereum.\nUm, Ethereum sort of petered out at like 4,500 or something like that.\nAnd but I think Ethereum, but also Ethereum doesn't have the 21 million only uh economics that that Bitcoin did, right?\nSo I think, and also I would say that, you know, when I watched two phases of Ethereum, I watched the ICO phase, and then I watched the DeFi phase, and even in both phases, I would say the the ICO phase was like 95% [ __ ], 5% good stuff.\nI would say the the DeFi summer was 80% [ __ ], 20% high octane, really great stuff, you know, that's still with us today.\nUm, I would say that BitTensor is 80% high octane good stuff and 20% [ __ ].\nI, I have never seen this before.\nSo I, I just feel like it's all this concentrated bald energy.\nAnd the people that are sort of my crypto friends, crypto only friends, they're largely, you know, they got their MetaMask, they got their ledgers, they got their uh, their phantom wallets with a p ph.\nAnd when they hear about TAO, they're like, no, how do I put it in my my [ __ ] MetaMask?\nHow do I get these, how do I get these [ __ ] subnet tokens on my MetaMask?\nRight.\nLike that's where their brains go.\nAnd if they can't get it on their MetaMask, they don't know what to do.\nYeah, exactly.\nI mean, I was talking about that with Michaela from Nova actually yesterday.\nAnd uh, what we want to do is we want to team up with subnet owners and do the work of going to everyone like Solana Foundation, ETH companies, um, you know, wallet companies and and everyone and try to kind of explain how they should help us to create this kind of one-click button, you know, one, so so they, so people could buy alpha tokens.\nI, I agree with you.\nI mean, there's a, there's definitely a lot of traction.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI, so, I've seen several attempts at at what you just described.\nUm, some of which are going to launch soon, and some of them are pretty awesome.\nI think you're going to be pretty happy.\nI don't know if you've seen what I've seen.\nNo, I don't think so.\nI've seen a thing, and I'm, I can't say what it is.\nI've seen a thing.\nFOMO right now.\nOh, man.\nYeah.\nNo, I, uh, it's, I what I saw last week, I, I'm just like, thank you, baby Jesus.\nThis is like in my little picture in my head of like the magical universe that I was hoping was going to come.\nLike, it's going to be here real soon.\nSo yeah, it's, it's real.\nSo, um, okay, so let's talk about your marketing efforts because I think, I think you're right, and and I, I think of all the subnet owners, you have attacked subnet marketing with professionally produced podcasts.\nI got to say your production values are even higher than mine.\nRight.\nSo you've got like a, got a pro host.\nYou're like, I'm just a guy, right, with a broom and a camera and whatever.\nBut you've got like a pro um, host, and you've got like pro editing and lighting and the whole nine yards.\nWhat in, so who else?\nI don't think anybody else is doing that.\nWhat, why did you decide to do that?\nAnd what's, what's sort of the reaction been to it?\nUh, I would say maybe because we realized that um, we were not uh, early enough in the ecosystem to be considered as a strong AI research team.\nYeah.\nSo, we just made the decision to stand out in a different way and create a new type of communication strategy for people to first focus on the brand and then realize we're actually doing good tech.\nUh, it was kind of silly for us to try to compete with a macrocosmos or a templar.\nAnd and it's so obvious that they're bright.\nThen we were like, maybe the, maybe the blue ocean is not on trying to be a gigab brain, but to be actually a nice brand, a nice brand, you know, you know, to market your way out of it, you know, I, that was that.\nAnd honestly, oh, also, just one thing I'm going to share with you, so we started with a, with a version of the of the subnet that was not good at all, uh, that was called SCORE Predict.\nEveryone told us, we've been called out even by const, and we weren't too proud to say that it was true.\nSo, we made the decision to move from some, some sort of a, you know, sports prediction subnet to a computer vision subnet.\nWe kept the sports DNA because we knew that was the shortest route to revenue, but we actually went deeper from a tech perspective.\nAnd when we did this, when we announced the pivots, our emissions went down dramatically.\nSo, we went from 1.3%, so pre-detail 1.3% to like 3%.\nAnd it was hard, really, really hard.\nSo what we decided, because detail was was around the corner, was to also take the good part of the crypto space, which is marketing is driving attention, and attention most of the time is driving price action.\nUh, and again, we couldn't compete against the gigab brain.\nSo we just put more time and effort on creating a good brand.\nWell, I saw you had Will Squires on your podcast, so it looks like you are recruiting the Gigab Brains onto your podcast.\nI watched episode two last night.\nSo, thanks for that.\nI love Will.\nI mean, Will is has been so supportive with us since uh, the the very early days, and yeah, that was such a good thing to have him on the podcast.\nBy the way, you should join, you should come on the podcast, too.\nWhenever you want.\nI'd love to come on.\nAbsolutely.\nSo, yeah, I'd be honored.\nSo, yeah, especially, I mean, following Will Squires.\nI mean, you know, who can follow that?\nBut I'll try.\nYeah.\nBut no, I agree with you.\nThe macrocosmos guys are are brilliant.\nThey have, they have four subnets now, I think.\nUh, I think so.\nYou know, I lost, I lost the count, but um,\nYeah.\nYeah.\nNo, I'm like, it used to be three, but I think it's four now.\nSo, I don't.\nYeah, I think it's four.\nYeah.\nYeah, maybe.\nAnd their IOTA one is like the new one, right?\nSo, which is sort of a competitor to Templar.\nSort of not.\nYeah.\nSo, I haven't really dug too hard into that, but I, I think the, I do think that their brainiac subnets, right?\nThey're, they're not as, and Templar also is a brainiac subnet.\nThose are moonshots.\nThose are um, very, you know, zero to one projects where if they win, they are the gods of the universe, but they're not sort of going after, there is no sort of little crossing the chasm market that they can go after like what you're doing, right?\nSo you're, we need them.\nWe need them because that that gives such a big credibility that shows that we're doing like strong AI things.\nSo yeah, these are moonshots, but we actually really need them.\nWe do need them, but they're not really, well, they're not really well suited to the DTA universe, right?\nWhich is sort of forcing people, right?\nLike the the old research PBS, like this is a debate, right?\nLike is the purpose of DTA and BitTensor to boot things up with very, you know, instead of going to VCs and raising money and burning that money, just boot up a subnet and you get a bunch of free work, right, for which ver, and but, but that's sort of, and it's just a condition of your existence that this is, you know, it's part of your VC fund raise, if you will, that you're in the subnet and um, subnet token world, alpha token world, uh, versus no, BitTensor is PBS, right?\nIt's you're supposed to live forever off of emissions so that we can do these moonshot project projects, and that's just, you know, we should never, and those things should never get to revenue or don't have to, right?\nAnd and I, I hear two opinions on this, right?\nLike there, there's very wildly different opinions on whether that should exist.\nI, I love the fact that Templar and and Will Squires exist.\nI agree with you, and I, and I feel like they bring cred to the entire ecosystem because this is like the serious person's uh, universe, and I think, I think we need that, and I, right, because we got the crypto side, which makes people think we're [ __ ] artists, right?\nSo we need like, we need like the brainiacs here too, people like, oh, looks like there's some smart people there.\nYeah, I know that Macrocosmos is also getting revenue from different customers.\nSo, I think it's probably just a matter of time.\nUm, and the the thing you just pointed in the right, you know, you pointed out the fact that detail, I think it's also brought up a different time frame.\nYeah.\nSo, people are going to be impatient, which I get.\nUh, but moonshots are very, very important for for the system.\nHonestly, I'm a huge revenue guy.\nI mean, we've been talking about that, but uh, without s, without, you know, um, Templar, without Macrocosmos, without Targon, without shoots, um, you know, we wouldn't be considered as uh, like a serious web 3 AI protocol.\nNow you mentioned in the podcast LA that I watched last night that you're using subnet, you're using one of macrocosmos subet subnet 13.\nYeah, we actually, we are.\nUh, yeah, we part, we partner with Macrocosmos, and when the first uh, so when our c, like our sports betting customer would start generating revenue uh, by the new season in late August, uh, we would start kicking part of the revenue back to Macrocosmos 2 as a data provider.\nOh, interesting.\nOkay, very good.\nBy the way, for us, it's also very important.\nSo, what I'm trying to do now, uh, with my very, very little platform is to vouch for subnet collaboration and also some sort of an abstraction where a customer could come and just use all different subnets without even thinking about, you know, all the scaffolding.\nSo I think we should really promote uh, subnet collaboration, um, you know, when we needed to, and before Basilica, when we needed to uh, train our model, for instance, we went and, you know, we used Selium, uh, when we when we needed some data, some extra data for our AI agent, we went directly to subnet 13.\nI think we should all do this.\nWe should all try to see what we can, you know, bring to each other.\nUh, we should introduce ourselves to different customers, opportunities.\nI, I think we should, we should definitely do this.\nThat would, it's, it's, you know, it's positive, some, it's a subnet composability.\nOh yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd there, and the reason we do it is partly because we're, we, we, it's we're, we're all we're a Kretzu, and we're all joined together to hit by the underlying token.\nSo it's right.\nSo if I'm in subnet X and I can use subnet Y or I can just use a vendor that has nothing to do with BitTensor, it's in my interest to use subnet Y because that will drive value to BitTensor that will to the token.\nYeah.\nSo very interesting.\nYeah.\nBecause I don't think we've never had an ecosystem before where, you know, a base token has has created a Kretzu, you know, sort of Ethereum and DeFi, but sort of, but but it is, it isn't as directly related.\nYeah.\nUm, you know, the the value creation driving everything in the TAO, that doesn't exist in Ethereum because you just, you know, you spend your ETH, and then it's gone, and you don't give a [ __ ], right?\nAnd ETH sort of gas and ephemeral, and away it goes, whereas TAO is a very diff, the tokconomics and the way it works was just extremely different.\nSo okay, well, we're, we're almost up on the hour, so I just want to uh, uh, first of all, thank you, but I also want to ask you, what were you doing before this?\nWhere do you come from, and how did you end up coming into this universe?\nUh, so my, so my background is in, I was working in advertising, be like before in the early days, then I started a company, and we were trying to mine Bitcoin with green energy.\nThat was like late, late 2016.\nUm, but I was too close to the metal, that was like an engineering player.\nI'm more of a business person, marketing type of person, so I just enjoyed the crypto side of things, but not really the engineer, engineering side of things, so went back to something more digital, helped some projects go to market, learned a lot about game theory and stuff like that, tokconomics.\nUh, started working for a protocol that was called Human Protocol, and uh, we were annotating data for AI companies using a global workforce.\nI was, you know, really passionate about their vision, uh, not so on the product roadmap.\nSo I was still trying to understand how I could leverage like a crowd of people to create value, and I ended up co-founding a company called Crunch Dow, and uh, we built\n\n\nA community of machine learning engineers to create machine learning models for banks, hedge funds, financial institutions.\n\nUm, and I learned a lot about uh decentralized intelligence.\nThen, um, in parallel, I met with my current co-founders Nigel and Tim, and they were extremely well connected in different world tech sports.\nUm, they built a company together that they sold to a public company in the UK, so they know how to do business too.\nUm, and we started working with athletes, one of them being Harry Kane, um, the England captain.\nWe built an app with him.\nWe started talking with players, coaches, and, and I don't know why, but at some point someone, I think that was a football manager.\nHe turned to us and say, \"Why don't you do what you're doing in finance, but in the world of sports?\"\nAnd it started like that, and then we started trying to do uh, so we launched the subnet, trying to do predictions, realized we need to do computer vision, then yeah.\n\nAnd here you are.\nOkay, well, yeah, because you definitely, I love the fact that your your your DNA is that of a marketer and that of a business person, and it's it's very clear the way you run your subnet, um, which is, I think we need, I think we need more use in our little universe, at least to get at least to begin with, right?\nSo, we also need the Brainiacs, but we we also need more use.\nSo, I'm really, really happy that you're you're one of our subnet uh owners and operators.\n\nI appreciate it.\nThanks for that, Mark.\n\nWell, thank you, Max.\nI really, really appreciate you taking some time to come and explain your universe to us.\nAnd I'm sorry it took me again so long to get to you.\nIt shouldn't have happened, but but it did.\nHere we are now.\n\nSo, all right.\nAll right, everybody.\nMy name is Mark Jeffrey.\nThis has been Hash Rate.\nWe'll see you all next time.\n",
