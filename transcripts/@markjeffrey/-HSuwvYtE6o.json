  "cleanText": "Hello everybody and welcome to Hash Rate. My guest today is Voter from Zeus.\nHello Voter, how you doing?\nHi Mark, thank you so much for bringing me on.\nSo let's talk about Zeus. So it is a subnet for predicting the Weather, right? So the the biggest question that most people will probably have when they hear that is, \"Yeah, dude. I've already got weather.com and I've got like Apple weather. So, you know, why do I need this, right? Like, so what what is the answer to that just in general?\nI think the answer is I agree with that. Our focus is not necessarily for the people because let's be honest, we we all don't care about a .5 degree difference in the prediction of the weather of tomorrow. We just want to know like what's the temperature going to be like. Um we mainly want to focus on companies that highly depend on accurate weather data. So for example, energy grid forecasting and everything that uses like the most advanced weather data in order to get the most accurate predictions. That's basically what we want to focus on.\nUm so your Apple app or your Google app will stay the same. It will likely not depend on our data and we're fine with that.\nAnd does and so the people So tell me who are these people that need extremely precise weather predictions? Is it like farmers? Is it you know who who are we talking about here?\nYeah, there are a lot of people that need it. Indeed, farmers are one of them. Um\nuh on top of that also high performing athletes such as in Formula 1.\nOh wow. The accuracy of rain is is is really um important for the outcome. So also traders that actually want to trade on things like Formula 1 also depend on it because they want to know who's going to win and Max for Steappen from the Netherlands is pretty good in the rain. So I always like to see it rain and maybe we can predict that in the future.\nVery good. Okay. So um so we we've spoken with another subnet and I won't name them, but there is another subnet out there that does weather.\nAnd um I did get an explanation from them of how they um you know what what they're using. And basically their their whole um the way they work is all of their miners run MS Aurora, which I guess is a um it's a weather package that Microsoft puts out there. And all their miners are tweaking, I think, tweaking Aurora to make it better or, you know, hopefully better. Um, and the ones that get the most accurate predictions using MS Aurora, they're the ones that get the emissions out of the subnet. Are you guys also using MS Aurora or are you using something else?\nNo. So, um, this other subnet that we won't name.\nYeah.\nUh, basically what it's all about is fine-tuning a model. Uh, something we in the AI are all familiar with. We think that is not the right right approach for forecasting weather. um because this is something that has been done for years and years now and it only results in models that are slightly better say .1% and it cost cost millions and millions of dollars to train these models. So what we do is we just send over a query for a specific area and then we retrieve the data from the miner and then we track their performance on local areas. And this allows the miners to really excel in specific areas and train like sophisticated smaller models for smaller areas.\nAnd then based on like their track record, we can track back um which minor is the best on that specific location. So this utilizes the decentralized uh let's say bit tensor method uh optimally because people can train small models and be really really good at it. And we see that it works because we just published like a paper yesterday that we if we utilize this smartly we can see that miners perform 30% better than state-of-the-art models like combined.\nWow. 30% better. Okay. So so let's just let's just recap. So you know we were talking about MS Aurora. Your claim is that that you know using that uh package could get you like a 1% better accuracy. Um, and so you you're like, \"That's not good enough. So, we're not we're gonna go do that.\" Instead, you focus your miners are focused on small geographic areas, not like sort of conceptual areas, but geographic areas. So, like, you know, this city here or something like that, right? And I don't know what they're using, but I guess they're they're using some form of an LLM or or, you know, probably not probably not an LLM, but something like an LLM, like the way the image generation is LLM. It's something like that but with weather and um and and it's a a model that's tuned for weather but not Aurora. And you're getting 30% better forecasts, more accurate% lower error rate.\nAnd that's all because we just track on every single location which minor historically performs best. And then based on that, we can say, okay, now we're going to use this minor for this location and this minor for this location. And this allows the miners to essentially kind of work together. Um I do have to do like a small disclaimer. We're only getting that on temperature which was the first thing we introduced and we're increasing the variables we want to want the miners to predict one by one. So every single time we see an insane performance like this we will move on to the next one. Currently we're doing precipitation. We also see promising results and we want to do it like one by one so that eventually in like one or two years we get a 30% lower error rate for every single variable and people will really start using our API.\nWow. So um what so if you're not using MS Aurora what are you using?\nYeah. So that's the um big difference between our subnet and the other weather subnets. Um the miners are not uploading a model. So they're basically just providing answers. So we're we don't know what the miners are using. What we do know is that we uh let the validators use an API that queries state-of-the-art models so that we have a benchmark uh against the state-of-the-art models and we incentivize miners. We basically give them a higher reward if they beat that prediction. Um\nsorry let me let me just this is a this is a key point and so you are so the validators determine who is right who did the best job and they do that not by recording what happened and then comparing the forecast against the actual measurement of temperature or whatever they compare it against another model um I believe probably erra 5 climate if I'm not mistaken I'm just guessing but that's that's what I That's what I\nwe are benchmarking it against both like uh what the actual data is and then based on that you can can get a reward of like uh .5 so half of the reward and then on top of that if you beat the state-of-the-art model uh from this API you get like the other half of the score so you can get like double the score if you beat state-of-the-art and what is state-of-the-art uh we query an API that intelligently uses multiple different models across the globe to get the best predictions so basically what we are doing currently, this API is also doing with the best models out there.\nUm, and we're just trying to build the same thing but then better and it works.\nWow. Yeah. I know this feels like a I mean I do think in general this weather market is a big one and and it feels like it feels like this this AI technology is is yielding some very sort of shockingly good results and and what I what I've been told about the the old way of of predicting weather is it's sort of it takes 5 days for these old models to run apparently and they're all like written in cobalt or some probably forran actually is probably like they're really old and ganky, right? Like, and nobody's updated them since like the 60s, you know, and and so yeah, it's like it's like the Swift system in the bank in the banking universe, right? It's just like why the hell are we still dealing with this garbage? It's just because nobody's cared to update it, right? There's been no reason to.\nSo, yeah. Okay. Um Okay, so let's talk about who you're charging. So, do you have paying customers yet or is that something still in the future?\nAnd who do you think tell me what your Yeah, tell me about your business model and who you might charge.\nYeah. So um as I said we can dive into multiple different things. I think the most obvious one that we can dive into is um green energy. So basically energy prices across the globe change a lot every single hour based on the amount of green energy that is being being generated.\nUm because it's always like when there's a higher demand the prices go up and when there's a lower demand the prices go down. And basically what you see is that during the day when there is sun there's a lot of green energy from solar panels and therefore the price goes down but you can like predict that based on how much sun there is that day.\nSo what we can do is as I said before we are introducing variables one by one every single time we want to beat the state-of-the-art before we move on to the next one. And what we will do is just cherrypick those to address a specific market. So the next variable we would like to introduce is wind speed at 100 meters which is perfect for wind turbines because it directly correlates with how much energy those get.\nYeah. So 100 meters off the ground is what you when you say 100. Yeah. Okay. So like where the where the propellers are. Yeah.\nExactly. Yeah. Yeah. So um our first market will likely be energy trading and therefore we can cherrypick the the right variables in order to address that market as soon as possible. So as soon as we have like two or three more variables in we can start selling the API.\nWow that's amazing. That's that's a absolute need for that right. So um so what is the total addressable market for uh energy weatherdriven energy green energy? Yeah. So that specific niche is u more than a billion dollar industry yearly. Um so it would be awesome if we get the most accurate forecast on weather so that people can trade on our data and that's our goal. We're going to address that market first and the market is bigger but I I don't want to beat the guy that says it's a trillion dollar market and\nRight.\nYeah. No, it's it's best to to aim smaller and overd deliver than Yeah.\ntotally with you on that.\nUm,\nokay. So, how so let's talk about your subnet. So, how long is have you been running your subnet and how is it funded at the moment?\nYeah. So, um, we've been running it since March I believe. I'm not really sure to be honest. Um, and it's funded by our mining operation. Uh, we initially were a mining team. uh we might like a lot of subnets and at some point we really saw that climate forecasting was something that wasn't really done in bit tensor and bit tensor is like perfect for climate forecasting because it essentially is a decentralized problem. So we saw like the need for climate forecasting or weather forecasting and we had so much experience that in like a couple weeks we programmed an entire subnet and we we funded up until this day with our mining operation and that's the way we roll and on top of that one of our engineers our machine learning engineers actually did research at Cambridge to AI weather forecasting and he's actually currently in Vancouver at ICML, one of the biggest AI conferences, and he's presenting that they're the only paper that is accepted into ICML on climate forecasting. So, this is a big announcement here.\nHuge.\nYeah, it's actually huge. We we sponsored the paper. Our company name will be in it. And yeah, they basically created a state-of-the-art model for climate forecasting. So, he's the one with all the knowledge. He created the entire subnet and that is what allowed us to incentivize the miners to get this insane results of 30% lower error rates.\nThat is incredible. So\nyeah.\nUm so this is a question that I get a lot actually when I'm explaining Bit Tensor to people uh and the subnets, right? Um you so you're living off of you basically been living off your own emissions from your subnet, but also you've been mining other people's subnets. So that's been generating some revenue for you.\nUm, and at the moment you're not you're not generating revenue. Although there's this big market, you you could start attacking and charging people for these forecasts.\nUm,\nbut let's just say you're successful. Let's say you're selling like crazy and you know you're making I don't know, call it a hundred million a year in revenue. Let's say, right? It's a billion dollar market. Let's say you get a tenth of it, right? Because you're 30% better. A tenth feels reasonable, right? So\nI agree. So, you're making 100 million in revenue. Um, why would you not at that point just say, \"You know what? F this subnet BS. Uh, f all the miners. You know, I don't want to share my subnet emissions with them. In fact, I don't even care about this Bit Tensor thing. I'm just going to run my $100 million business and turn it into 500 million and then I'm going to flip it to somebody um who doesn't want anything to do with subnets or crypto or anything like that.\" Why wouldn't you do that?\nWell, um, as I just explained, uh, one of our machine learning engineers is really good at AI climate forecasting.\nYeah.\nAnd we actively try to mine our own subnet, and we just can't make it work because the other miners are just really really good at what they're doing. So, we need them. That's that's the simple answer. In order to get this insane results, we need them. And, uh, that will just keep going forever. And it also allows us to focus on other things than the performance. It is the main selling point. But um if we can just set up a world where people are incentivized to get the best results and we can do everything else that is the perfect world because otherwise we would need like additional engineers in order to get this performance and now this is all solved by bit tensor. So we need them we want them and in the future we will definitely pay them for what they're doing. Currently it's all bootstrapped by $TAO but eventually this revenue stream will also go into their wallets or\nOh really? Yeah,\nthat happen.\nYeah. So, as soon as we are start starting to make money, we will just give it back to miners and what that ex\n\n\nExactly will look like uh is something we still have to think about.\nIt will likely change over time, but it's uh definitely something we're going to do because we want to keep this performance.\nWill it be like you pump USDC into all their wallets, or will it be?\nYeah, more like you do.\nOkay.\nSo, actual So, yeah.\nOkay.\nSo, actual crypto payments into wallet.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nInteresting.\nYou're the first person I've heard that.\nYeah.\nNo, no, that's you're the first.\nSo, I've heard like, you know, people say, \"Well, we're going to do buybacks of our alpha tokens.\"\nUm, you know, or we're going to require our customers to buy services from us using our alpha token.\nWe don't accept anything else.\nSo, I've heard that thesis.\nThe buybacks is by far the the the preferred one at the moment.\nSo um I see obviously we're going to do that as well because we want to keep the bootstrap going, but um yeah, as time progresses, the amount of $TAO that is like given out because of the whole things will decrease significantly, and you need to keep incentivizing the miners.\nSo we will do that by basically paying them for their insane uh predictions.\nVery interesting.\nOkay.\nYou're you're literally the first person who said this to me.\nSo that's that's a new thought from my brain, and I'm going to be thinking about that from now on.\nUm, okay.\nSo, uh, who are you guys and what were you doing?\nWhat were you doing before all this?\nI guess I know what the Cambridge guy was doing.\nHe was at Cambridge.\nSo, who who else what what were you doing and what led you to get into, uh, Bit Tensor and and weather, I guess, in general?\nYeah.\nSo, um, I studied AI actually at the University of Amsterdam, and um, I was doing my thesis at KPMG.\nUh I was in my final weeks, and then someone introduced me to Bit Tensor, and I read the paper on Bit Tensor, and it immediately clicked, and I was like, \"Oh, damn.\"\nSo I literally dropped out of uh university.\nI was three weeks out, no joke, um, to start mining and to start like building on top of Bit Tensor.\nUm, and it went pretty well.\nI started a company to start mining, and then eventually because we saw the need of the Weather on the tensor, we started a Weather subnet, and um yeah, two of the machine learning engineers that work with us also come from my study.\nThe guy that went to Cambridge actually is also from the University of Amsterdam, but he was asked to come and do his thesis over there on uh weather forecasting because he's a really intelligent guy, so they spotted him.\nThey were like, \"Come over here, we 2,\" and now uh they're presenting their work on the one of the biggest biggest AI conferences in the world.\nSo yeah.\nWhat are the AI what are the AI people like when you tell them, \"Hey, I'm I'm a Bit Tensor Subnet,\" right?\nBecause they're all like, \"Well, I'm with OpenAI.\nOh, okay, well, I'm with Grock,\" right?\nAnd you're like, \"Oh, I'm I'm with this crypto Bit Tensor thing.\"\nLike, do they look down on you as like, you know, what what's that?\nI think or or are they curious and do they think it's kind of cool?\nYeah, they're definitely curious, but crypto obviously also has like a name, and uh I'm always trying my best to to explain to them that there's actually real value over here, but um I feel like everyone is trying to do that with every crypto, and there are some scam cryptos out there.\nSo, I think people are definitely interested, but at the same time, they're also like, \"I don't know.\"\nWell, I think that's got to be changing a little bit with all the activity, at least in the United States, with all the activity in Congress, just, you know, over the last 48 hours, right?\nWe passed three crypto bills, right?\nThey're not totally signed in law yet.\nBut I mean, holy, that's like that is far more than that's happened in the last, you know, 20 years.\nI agree.\nBut in Europe, it's the other way around.\nEverything is like anti-crypto.\nEven setting up a company and trying to pay like taxes and just do everything legit is really hard.\nGetting a bank account in Europe as a crypto company is super hard.\nUm, well, it used to be that way in the United States, like until until Trump.\nI mean, under under Biden and and Warren, it was it was horrific, and it was exactly the same way, right?\nAnd then everything just sort of flipped around, you know, over the last like, you know, four months or so.\nSo, yeah, I agree.\nI I really hope that the same will happen in Europe because um yeah, I think it's unfortunate that you let people that are so intelligent spend their time on things like getting a bank account and and explaining crypto when you all we're trying to do is make good AI and uh make it all better.\nBut um I think over time people will just see that um for example with Zeus, we're doing such a good job as soon as we introduce every single variable and we actually beat state-of-the-art, uh people cannot deny that that it actually holds holds value.\nSo u it will just take time.\nAre there companies that are not uh Bit Tensor uh but yet our AI, are they attacking this same weather problem that you are?\nYeah, absolutely.\nIt's such a big industry.\nThere are so many companies trying to do this up until this point.\nBasically what you also see in other industries, the the big companies such as Google, um they completely dominate the entire industry, and um yeah, I love it that we with Bit Tensor can kind of attack that by uh joining forces and letting people like combine their work.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nPretty pretty interesting.\nSo um all right, let's talk now just about Bit Tensor in general a little bit.\nSo um you know that I it it strikes me and some other people that I speak with that we have not yet seen a giant breakout multi-billion dollar subnet yet.\nRight now, I mean, I'm not talk I'm not talking fully diluted value.\nI'm just talking, you know, market cap with circulating supply today.\nRight.\nIt's all you know, it's pretty much shoots is at the top, you know, around 100 million or so.\nIt depends on where you look, but whatever.\nYeah.\nAnd and everybody else is sort of, you know, uh, varying degrees of schlimpier, you know, down to like, you know, a couple hundred k for sort of like the schlimpiest of the of the subsets.\nYou know, the average one is sort of like, you know, 1 to 2 million, maybe four to five million kind of depending on on where they are in the pack.\nUm, which is which is kind of shockingly small compared to some other projects uh out there in the in the uh broader crypto world like Akos or you know whatever, you know, or or virtuals things in the virtuals universe, right, which are several orders of magnitude larger in terms of market cap with circulating supply.\nUm, which I think is good because I think I think Bit Tensor are sort of healthier, um, but but I think these market caps are way too small, and I I think the only reason why is be one of one of you know, one thing is education.\nA lot of people don't know about the Bit Tensor universe yet.\nI think they're figuring it out.\nI think that's changing.\nBut I think the bigger problem or challenge or reason why we haven't seen a lot of liquidity flow in is because it's hard for it to get over into subnets, right?\nYou have to buy a token, you have to get a Bit Tensor wallet, right?\nSo there's there's sort of there's sort of two-prong attacks on this problem.\nOne is institutional investors uh or or people creating vehicles for institutional investors to invest in subnets directly.\nYou know, give your cash to a hedge fund.\nThe hedge fund then puts it into the subnetss.\nAnd I'm hearing a lot uh there there's a there's a lot of activity there.\nIt's not it it hasn't launched yet.\nUm, but I'm hearing like within the next few months there's going to be a lot of money flowing in through institutional.\nWe all know Barry Silbert is doing a lot to sort of facilitate this.\nUh, but the other sort of more immediate um thing I'm hearing about is consumer, and there are basically two um efforts underway that are going to drop I think both next week.\nUm, one is what Sturdy is doing, uh, which will allow subnet tokens to be purchased with USDC, Tether, or Ethereum on the base chain.\nUm, right.\nAnd then you buy your subnet token, and it goes directly into your MetaMask wallet.\nYou you never have to you don't have to worry about TOAO at all.\nYou just you're basically just in Ethereum universe.\nYou're like or base universe, and you're like, \"Well, I just want to buy something that tokens.\"\nYou can just do it, right?\nThat which I it it looks magical, right?\nLike I cannot wait for this to launch.\nThey say they're launching next week.\nThe other the other option is something called um Void, and Void has got a traditional bridge and wrapped token uh on Salana.\nOh, okay.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo that's apparently coming like any day now.\nAnd the idea there is that the the subnet tokens will appear in the standard issue Salana dexes like Radium, like you'll go to Radium, and there will be subnet tokens, you know, on the on the menu.\nAwesome.\nAwesome.\nWhich this other thing which Sturdy will not have, right?\nLike to my knowledge, right?\nBecause when you buy a subnet token using Sturdy, it actually exists on the EVM layer of the Bit Tensor chain, which means it's honest, right?\nThere's no bridge.\nSo anyway, I know it's kind of a long- winded explanation, but um that's fine.\nWhat what do you think of of these these consumer bridges and and things?\nAre you bullish on it?\nWill you be participating in it?\nUm, I think they're definitely good, but I think we we should go even one step further.\nUh I think most of the volume in crypto is coming from people just opening an app that everyone knows uh and buying some crypto.\nI think that is like I have no clue what the actual numbers are, but let's say it's like 50% of the volume.\nUm, but I think it will just take time.\nSo for example, with Zeus, if we really uh become the best weather forecasting agent out there, people want to buy our alpha token, and people will start asking, \"Where can I buy this?\"\nAnd companies will jump uh in there and be like, \"You can buy it over here,\" and then other companies will do it as well.\nSo I think we should just keep building, and then as soon as the value goes up even more, we will see that companies just start building on top of these things you're just explaining.\nUh to make it like super, super easy for people to just open an application on their phone and be like, \"Ah, I want to buy Zeus because uh they're doing an insane job.\"\nUm, so yeah, I am bullish, but I'm I also think it will take some time before it actually starts working because I think you have to build something else on top of that if that makes sense.\nYeah.\nNo, I and there's another sort of part B to this whole question, and that is what what is a subnet token, right?\nI thought about this question a lot.\nYou know, is it just is it a memecoin for a subnet, right?\nAnd and right kind of feels like maybe that is the case, but you know, is the stock Tesla nothing more than a memecoin for the company Tesla?\nRight.\nAnd and and sort of yes, right?\nSort of a meme coin for Elon.\nSort of a meme coin for whatever Tesla is doing.\nYou know, theoretically there are fundamentals and other things, but really the market just decides on what they think the valuation of Tesla is based on how they feel about Elon or the or you know what products.\nI think I totally agree.\nIt's it's kind of like stocks in general are kind of meme coins, and as soon as you get dividends, it's just the company deciding they're going to pay like a little bit to the people that hold it.\nUm, and I think with uh what I've just described with giving back to the miners, we can also do that to the validators or the stakers.\nUm, because we want to keep money inside the system, so people will be incentivized to invest.\nUm, but yeah, I I don't know how to answer it other than it it's just like you described.\nIt's an Elon Musk meme coin, but so it is a memecoin, but that's okay.\nYeah, because I think that's fine.\nThere is value.\nBack in the olden days, right, when people own stocks, like, you know, kind of in you know, top hat times, you know, like muffin, I've got my stocks, and you know, I'm getting dividends, you owned them for the dividends, right?\nLike that's why you own, yeah, exactly, right?\nAnd then like, I don't know when it happened, but at a certain point, like the dividends kind of went away, and this the you just had stocks with no dividends, which is sort of weird, right?\nLike would have been to you know, those people in the 20s and the top hats, and and and now we just own stocks here in the future, and there's basically no dividends, and that's not why you own the stock.\nYou own the stock because you think it's going to go up in value, right?\nSo, but there is no real connection to the fundamentals of the company.\nIt's all sort of, you know, it's just psychological, right?\nIt's not directly.\nTheoretically, if you have like 51% of those stocks, which is like impossible to get, but you actually have like a big vote, and um and even if you accumulate a lot of stocks over time, and you you get like a significant amount, you officially have the right to to have a voice inside the company.\nUm, so I think that there's some value over there.\nI don't know how this relates to alpha tokens to be honest.\nUm, but in some sense, it it might be the same because currently what you see on Bitensor with alpha tokens is that miners accumulate like a lot of alpha, and all of a sudden they they start conversations with the subnet owners because yeah, they they hold like a significant amount of the subnet.\nSo they obviously have a right to say something, and if they don't believe in the future, they will dump it, and that's also not good for the company.\nSo I think it kind of works in the same way.\nUm, do you guys have do you guys have people approaching you saying like, \"Yo, uh, I own 3% of your supply.\nUh, when can we meet?\"\nDo you have like that?\nWell, not like that, but but yeah, we definitely talk to our miners.\nThey're doing an incredible job.\nUm, we currently have two variables on our subnet, and we see one team that is good at one and another team that's good in the other.\nSo, we're just trying to make the subnet uh fair in a way that both\n\n\nMiners groups can stay in.\nUm, and but yeah, so yeah, they definitely reach out.\nThey don't say like the amount they have, but we can definitely infer that based upon what we see in our Subnet.\nUm, yeah, I guess what I'm saying is like some people feel like, you know, when they own a large amount of your Subnet token or or guess stock in your company, they feel like they they now have a right for you to like demand answers from you, right?\nThey're like, \"Okay, I I kind of agree on that, although I don't like it, but uh it makes sense if someone owns a big big big part of your company or whatever it is that they can say something about it.\"\nSo, um yeah, although uh as a Subnet owner, I might not like it.\nI think it's something uh you have to deal with and I think it's also healthy because otherwise it's just your vision and your team deciding what's going on.\nAnd now you also have like other people jumping in.\nAnd of course, you have to take everything they say with a grain of salt because they always try to make the submit in a way that will be beneficial for them.\nUh, sure.\nOr or they might not know anything about Weather or AI and they might be like, \"Listen, I got an idea.\nI just don't stop me.\nDon't stop me.\nI know how to predict the Weather using a magic eightball and I it totally works, right?\"\nThey have some baddy idea like that, right?\nAnd you have to be like, \"Oh, I guess I have to listen to this.\"\nSo, yeah.\nSo you you as an owner of a company, you always have to like uh pick out the right information and sometimes you have to ignore people and that can uh negatively impact your company temporarily, but as long as you make the right decisions every single time, the long game will will work out.\nSo uh yeah, we definitely had also people that wanted to change things on the Subnet because indeed they had like a lot of alpha.\nBut um yeah, if we truly believe that it's not beneficial for the Subnet, we just won't do it and uh we will just take the hit.\nWhat do you think about uh the Subnet scene in general?\nUh and by that I mean the yield in most cases, right?\nIf you if you own Subnet tokens, um you are getting somewhere between 70 to 70% to 90% APY kind of depend on what Subnet you own, right?\nVersus if you're just staking to root, it's now like 8% or 9%.\nIt used to be like 20%.\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo, and I used to on every show be like the root is too damn high.\nAnd now I feel like it's still it's still high, but it's not too damn high.\nI feel like it's at least something reasonable now.\nI think it should be like 4%, but I think it's heading in the right direction.\nUm, so the yield is pretty good, right?\nIf you if you stick around for a year, you roughly you don't quite double your your your holdings, but almost.\nUm, however, the dilution is pretty extreme, right?\nSo, you're getting diluted because of the emissions out of the chain of Subnet tokens, right?\nIt's it's in month one when a when a Subnet was born, it was roughly 75% dilution in a month, right?\nOh, really?\nI didn't even know that.\nWow.\nYeah.\nI I actually measured it.\nIt was about two and a half% a day like when a Subnet is just first born because it's just gushing, you know, at first it just gushes new tokens like crazy, right?\nAnd then that curve goes down pretty fast.\nUm so the dilution is after like month two, month three, it calms down into something a lot more reasonable.\nUm but you know, you're still you're still dealing with dilution.\nUm and it's still pretty big, right?\nUntil the happenings kind of come, right?\nUm comma again.\nBut the market caps as we noted earlier are extremely extremely extremely extremely low.\nReady AI uh I think last time I checked was like 20 million market cap.\nUh its correlary in the real world is Scale AI uh which just got sort of aqua hired by Facebook for 28 billion I believe.\nSo um I'm you know so I mean quite the delta there right?\nI agree.\nI agree.\nYou know and you have I'm not really too worried about it to be honest.\nUm I think that Yeah.\nSo the question is this.\nAre you an idiot if you're investing in Subnet tokens right now?\nAnd if not, why not?\nOkay, go ahead.\nTell me why.\nI think up until this point, Bitenser was a lot of bootstrap.\nPeople were still building.\nThere were a lot of mistakes inside Bitenser that uh we're still solving today.\nUh but at the same time, great things are coming.\nSo it makes sense that the uh entire market cap of Bitenser is relatively low.\nI think it's fine because it motivates people to go outside bit and actually do something with the product and that creates like uh a revenue stream into Bitenser which eventually will result in a higher market cap.\nSo it both motivates people now to to actually make things that work and eventually it will work out.\nSo if you want to invest into a Subnet, I would say if you truly believe in a product, just invest into it.\nWait for 10 years just like with Bitcoin in 2010 and then you will see the results.\nYeah, I think you're right.\nI mean I obviously I agree with that because I feel like I feel like the the riskreward of of moving early especially in crypto but especially in Bitensor uh where I I believe the economics are extremely good you know because you have you know everything is driving value into $TAO just more or less continuously and I think the decision to sort of shut off the spigot of new Subnets right so we we we're capped right now at 128 temporarily fairly we don't know how long this cap is going to last but I think that's forcing that's forcing the ecosystem to think only about those 128 obviously because there isn't anything else before there was everybody in their brother was trying to add a new Subnet and they were starting to get kind of shitty you know so like 90% of Bitensor is really awesome and then like anything there's like 10% maybe 15% that's just goofy ass and dumb and like shouldn't be in there but you have to deal with it um but that's sort of the inverse of the way Ethereum was during the ICO and the ICO phase and even the DeFi phase where it was sort of like 20% good stuff, 80% right?\nBit Tensor, it's flipped.\nIt's like 80 or 90% really good stuff and then you know 10 15% So, uh, but the 128 cap has really solidified that ratio of good to not good, I think.\nUm, so I I think I think I think taking the risks early while these I think the market caps are so low that it outweighs the dilution that you're seeing like it it won't Yeah.\nAnd I and I think these other and combined with the macro crypto market kind of exploding because of the regulations uh in the United States being passed in Congress and all these liquidity sources that are about to erupt both on the consumer side into Bitensor and on the institutional side.\nI think all it's just a guess and it's just my opinion but that's what it looks like to me.\nSo yes, concur.\nI agree.\nI just agree.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nAnd uh I I I yeah fully agree on the the ratio.\nI absolutely uh yeah, I'm a believer in the the temporarily cap and what you said about like the balance of the 8020.\nI think you will always see that and that's also something um that is encouraged by the low market cap because if the mark cap was like way higher, you would be super incentivized to create like a Subnet.\nAnd uh and get like 0.00001 emission because you would still be rich and right now that's not possible.\nSo uh I think the ratio is also correlated with the relatively low market cap and uh that allows us to keep building serious stuff and that will work out in the in the long long game.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo let so let's ask a sort of unpopular question.\nUm what are the threats to to um as as an investor in the Bitensor ecosystem, I'm always sort of running the disaster scenarios in my head like you know like with Ethereum right we had um you know Ethereum was a big success but then along came Salana right all the VCs looked at Ethereum and went oh you know what that looks pretty good let's go make our own one of those and let's fix all the problems with it right so let's make it super fast and let's go kill that thing with this Salana thing now it Salana did not succeed in killing Ethereum uh amazingly right because it it had everything going for it the speed the VCs you know I kind of thought it would I I you know by now have have sort of surpassed Ethereum and killed it off but Ethereum has hung on and still has like a giant amount of the TVL in the DeFi space something like 60% of all TVL is still to this day in Ethereum and it looks like it's going to start growing I know it's crazy right like it you don't you you think of it as like this old chain That's sort of like creaky and maybe Salana surpassed it, but it hasn't.\nNot even close.\nSalana is like 16th the size of Ethereum in terms of total value locked in DeFi or decentralized finance, which which is amazing given the advantages that it has, right?\nBut the VCs came along and they own a ton of Salana.\nThey don't own a lot of of Ethereum, right?\nSo they're like, well, we're going to own most of this one.\nCould $TAO face a Salana?\nCould A16Z wake up one morning and be like, you know what, that towel thing looks pretty good.\nLet's go make our own one of those and, you know, we'll own a third of it, right?\nWhat do you think about that?\nIs that possible?\nYeah, I think you basically kind of gave the answer I wanted to give, which is as soon as you make the the shift, people will be like, \"Ah, this is next big thing because it's a little bit better than Bitensor.\"\nAnd then they're going to go all in.\nAnd then what you will see is that a few big investors own like 80% of the market cap and that is so bad for the ecosystem.\nAnd I think Bitens did a really great job in like spreading all the tokens across multiple people in the beginning so that it's not owned by like four or five big institutions.\nSo yeah, you can definitely start like a better Bit Tensor or start your own Bit Tensor-ish token uh just focused on your own Subnet ID.\nUm I think in theory it would work if everyone on the same day in the same minute would uh shift towards it.\nUm but it's it's just impossible because initially you will see people that just buy uh and do a pump and dump or whatever you want to call it.\nSo, I think there's a threat if everyone would shift at the same time, but uh I think that's very unlikely.\nYeah, I agree with you.\nI think it was I think I think Bitenser was born well.\nUm yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's as it's as even even Bitcoin did not have the immaculate conception that a lot of people think it had, right?\nAnd and even I subscribed to the the the immaculate conception theory for a long time.\nUm until I have a friend named Fred Krueger and and another friend named Ben Sigman and together they wrote uh a book about Bitcoin where they they actually did a shitload of research into trying to figure out how it was born and who Satoshi was.\nThey've got some pretty interesting ideas on that.\nUm, but the the main thing I think that they uncovered and walked me through uh was that it was it was it was iterative.\nThere was there was sort of like this thing which led to this thing which led to this thing and they actually traced the evolution of it.\nRight.\nThey've got like they've got like the Cro-Magnon man uh you know the Neanderthal man.\nThey can show like you know the gradual evolution.\nAnd once once they sort of laid it out for I was like oh my god you're right.\nI think I think this is the right story.\nThis is pretty close to being the exact right.\nwhat I'm going to read next.\nBut now I'm curious about who who the founder of Bitcoin is.\nOr did they have Well, they don't say they don't say who they think Satoshi is, which which is which I think is good because I think like look, if you know that Clark Kent is Superman, you don't want you don't want to share that knowledge because you want to help Superman, right?\nYou want to be you want to be on Superman's team, right?\nI want to be on Satoshi's team.\nLike, if I knew for sure who he was, there's no way in hell you'd ever get that out of me.\nAnd I'd just pretend like I didn't know, right?\nSo you want I want to help Superman, right?\nBecause I like what Superman does.\nSo um so yeah, but but I I don't I no longer believe that it was, you know, sort of born perfect, you know, like like a like like a Mozart symphony.\nLike Mozart seemed to be able to do that, right?\nBut but I don't think I don't think Satoshi was able to do it with this.\nThat said, I do think that um Bit Tensor also is not perfect.\nUm but it's it's pretty good.\nIt's pretty it's as close as you probably get.\nUm and and I think I think it would be very difficult.\nIt's very close to an Immaculate Conception.\nUm and I think it would be very difficult for a venture-backed entity to replicate that vibe and I think that vibe is incredibly incredibly important.\nYeah.\nSo yeah, I think I agree with you that would be difficult for A16Z to do.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd bit was not also not like super overhyped at the beginning.\nAnd I think that's also a good thing because otherwise you you will get the the the thing where big VCs just buy like crazy and people would not like evolve over time but it would be like oh this is amazing.\nIf if people would know nowadays what Bitcoin was like back in 2009 and it would be like the new Bitcoin everyone would buy it and the entire like idea behind Bitcoin is gone.\nAnd I think the same for Bitenser.\nSo I think that's true.\nYeah, I've always thought like, you know, if somebody if somebody honestly totally got what Bitcoin was in 2009 and just basically bought every single Bitcoin, right?\nLike or bought like 90% of supply, then Bitcoin wouldn't have worked, right?\nBecause, right, because everybody would have looked at, well, that guy's got like 90% of it.\nLike, this is Like, it's not, you know, it\n\n\nHas to spread out amongst a lot of people for a lot of people to trust it.\nSo, yeah, I think you're right.\nYeah.\nSo, and I, I think people will be the same with $TAO in the future.\nThey'll be like, \"Oh, back in the day I mind, I wish I kept it.\"\nYeah.\nNo, I, I'm totally with you.\nI'm, I'm in, uh, I'm, I'm in accumulate as much as possible mode right now through multiple, uh, through multiple, um, efforts.\nI'll put it that way.\nAwesome.\nSo, awesome.\nSounds good.\nYeah.\nSo, um, what, what haven't I covered that you wish I had asked?\nIs there anything you want to sort of go over, or is that kind of it?\nWe kind of got it.\nOkay.\nMaybe I want to tell you a story about the stock market, about, uh, where the name is coming from.\nYou just talked a lot about the stock market and what it is, and do you have any idea where the name is coming from?\nWhere the name stock market came from?\nYeah.\nNo, I don't.\nOkay.\nSo, um, hundreds of years ago in the Netherlands, people would buy these ships, and they would sail out to India and wherever to, uh, explore the world, and that is what made Netherlands rich.\nUm, it's called the golden century for us.\nUm, but one of the things that happened is that people would invest a lot of money into their boats, and there was a relatively big chance that, um, these boats would be captured by pirates or just wouldn't make it back.\nSo, they thought about how do we fix this?\nSo, they thought about it for a long time, and at some point they were like, we should, instead of every single person buying a single boat, we should just combine it and buy boats together, and then they sell out, and then we share the profits.\nAnd people were trying to scam, uh, other people telling them that they owned, uh, a piece of the boat.\nSo then at some point they were like, how do we figure out who owns the boat?\nSo it turns out that if you take a stick and you break it, it always has like a unique breaking pattern.\nSo what they would do is they take a stick, break it, put one in the boat, and the other one they give it to the owner.\nAnd in the Netherlands, a stick is called stock.\nSo, so it's like a key, right?\nBecause only like that my stick goes with that stick, right?\nSo yeah.\nSo basically, you can identify your, your stock or stock in the Netherlands, uh, by showing your stock, and, uh, that's how the name stock market was born.\nThat's a great story.\nI love that.\nYeah.\nSo very, very cool.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nWhere can people find you online and where can we find Zeus?\nSo personally, I'm not doing anything on X.\nI'm just in behind Zeus.\nUm, I should probably change that.\nDo you, do you have an X account at all?\nYou, you must.\nI just have the Zeus account.\nOh, you just have the Zeus account, 'cause I know I'm like, I talked to somebody on X.\nOkay.\nYeah, the Zeus account.\nI have the Zeus account, so people can find that.\nAnd, uh, I think the tag is @zeussubnet if I'm not mistaken.\nLet me, yeah, I'll find it.\nPut it in.\nIt'll be in the show notes.\nYeah, @zeussubnet.\nAnd, um, people should definitely go to it and read the paper where we, uh, show the, what is it?\nOh, it's even 39.8.\n8% lower error that we achieve on temperature.\nSo read that, be hyped.\nI, people, I think that people generally don't understand how big this is.\nUm, yeah, but, uh, they will soon.\nSo, uh, so if I'm a Formula 1 racer and I want to buy, uh, predictions from your Subnet, where, where do I go do that?\nCan I, can't do that yet, right?\nWe're currently working, uh, on the API on our website, and soon, uh, you can actually start buying, uh, basically, can I like sign up to get on a list, you know, for when it, when it releases?\nYou know what?\nWe, we will actually implement that because you said.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWell, I mean, I figured we might want to collect customers, right?\nSo, I fig, I figure some people will see this, you know, uh, see this podcast or one of your many others, and, uh, and be like, \"Yeah, actually, I want to sign up for that.\"\nSince the last podcast I did or the first one, uh, people actually reach out to us, uh, mainly energy traders that want to buy our, uh, data because they're interested in it.\nThey see the performance.\nSo, uh, we do have some traction, and that this is also the reason we're going to cherrypick those variables because these are the first customers that actually reach out to us and want to buy our data.\nAwesome.\nWell, I wish you all success, man.\nThis is, it's been a fascinating hour.\nSo, thank you very much for.\nThank you so much for having me on, and, uh, Okay, see you soon.\nYep.\nMy name is Mark Jeffrey.\nThis has been Hash Rate.\nSee you all next time.\n",
