  "cleanText": "We did it.\nWe have completed the Vibe Studio.\nThis right here is my dream studio, and I'm building it, or we built it in San Francisco, and we're building it within my dream company.\nA few months ago, four months ago, I moved to San Francisco.\nI've been sleeping on the floor.\nIt's great.\nIt's fun.\nWe're having a good time.\nUh, we raised a bunch of money.\nI'll talk about that more in a little bit.\nThere's pros and cons to that, but we're like, okay, how do we want to spend this money to grow the company?\nAnd one of those initiatives is to build the Vibe Studio.\nAnd the Vibe Studio is a mixture of hardware.\nObviously, we have camera one, two, and camera three.\nYou also have a big display.\nYou can't see it, but uh, if you look right here, I can actually control my screen.\nAnd so, if I had three people sitting at this table, which we've done already in a previous episode, we can all be plugged in, and we can all share our screen at the same time.\nAnd if we wanted to create a video where we're all like three, like we compete against each other to see who can vibe code the coolest app.\nI think that style of video is really fun.\nAnd so I wanted to create a podcast studio that is both high quality and it has the flexibility to do a lot of screen sharing.\nWhy did I want to do screen sharing?\nWell, the biggest inspiration, I don't think people would be surprised by this, is Greg Eisenberg.\nSo Greg Eisenberg has the Startup Ideas podcast, and it is one of the fastest growing podcasts in business, or at least it was last year.\nI'm not familiar with how fast it's growing now, but I will say it is a new phenomenon, and it is something that I'm calling a demo cast.\nI think people are a little bit bored and tired of listening to people talk in podcasts.\nMaybe they're not tired of it because the podcast market is growing so fast and less and less people are making podcasts, right?\nThe growth rate of people who are making podcasts is actually going down.\nMeanwhile, the amount of eyeballs on podcasts are going up.\nThe appetite for long-form content is there.\nIt's just it's very winner take all.\nIt's not like short form where anyone can go viral.\nA lot of the people who are into podcasts watch and listen to the same podcasts.\nAnd I say watch because they're becoming more visual.\nIf you look at the long-form trends, right?\nPeople are watching YouTube videos on their TV, and it's becoming a replacement for Netflix, and I think that's very interesting, and so I think we're seeing a rise of like more visual podcasts, and people are getting tired of like the same pseudo philosophical Chris Williamson style podcasts where they just kind of like talk about philosophy but not like really, and I think people want tactical strategies to learn how to use specific tools and actually learn, right?\nThey don't want to just listen to two people talk about how AI is changing the world.\nThey want to see it.\nAnd I think Greg Eisenberg did a great job of creating this new thing called a demo cast, right?\nI call it that.\nI don't know if he calls it that.\nUm, which are almost like collaborative tutorials.\nAnd I wanted to do the same except I am in a company where almost everyone within the company is really smart, and they're really good at speaking, and they're really good at explaining things, and they all are interested in making content.\nThey just don't want to do all of the boring stuff that goes into content from their perspective, which is like making the hooks really good, making sure the edits are very solid.\nAnd if we can build a team, right, if we can build a system and a place where we can safely record things and and um make content where all they have to do is show up like it's a consulting call, then we can grow rapidly, and we can build the personal brands of every person in the company.\nAnd so I've had Kihan and Muhammad come on and talk about cursor, talk about claude code, talk about N8N and other popular features in the space.\nAnd then we can also include the Vibe Code App because the Vibe Code App is actually the company that we started is actually the cursor for mobile apps, and it's directly on your phone.\nI would say the design isn't the best right now, so it feels a little bit clunky, but we just hired a full-time designer.\nThey're going to be on the podcast uh very soon.\nWe're going to talk about AI and design.\nUm, but after that I think people are really going to realize that like we are literally building claude code in your phone that is a mobile app that builds mobile apps, and it is as good as cursor or cloud code if not better at building like full-on mobile apps.\nI mean 100% that is true, like we've tested it, and yeah, shameless plug, but we are building full speed ahead.\nWe are building the claw code in your phone that builds mobile apps, and it is epic, and the people who are working on this are elite, right?\nWe saw in the last video, we saw Khan build Lovable in uh like a 2-hour period as part of the episode.\nIt's going to be one of my um like we can see right here, we can see that it has like if we look at the analytics for it, you know, I mean, look at that.\n31,000 views in the first day.\nThis could really pump.\nOh, although it is starting to trend down.\nAnyway, point is, we have really, really, really talented people at this company, and we can bring them on, and we can talk about really cool topics, and we can teach people how to do things, and I think that is just like a really, really fun thing.\nAnd what not enough people are talking about is how to come up with video ideas and YouTube thumbnails, which I call pre-production.\nMy favorite way to do pre-production is with Spotter Studio.\nAnd as you can see here, it really helps with generating new ideas and going from initial idea to publish video.\nAnd I can do this with Spotter Studio.\nAnd so obviously right now I'm making a video about the Vibe Studio, three camera, three lights, AI powered studio.\nAnd I can just put in my idea.\nAnd so this will help me brainstorm my idea.\nAnd I just think this is more effective than chat GBT, for example.\nAnd like here we have these titles, and I can just save all the titles that I really like.\nOoh, tour Vibe Studio.\nThat's not that good.\nOoh, Vibe Studios cutting edge AI tech.\nNot as good.\nI definitely like Vibe Studios AI camera setup.\nI can hit continue.\nAnd here this will we can actually press explode and kind of make it explode.\nVibe hard.\nAI studios need actors.\nHm.\nWe can like add to it my fully AI powered uh three camera setup for my startup.\nAnd we can just hit continue and we can just rephrase it.\nI don't fully love it.\nOoh, I like this.\nContinue.\nLet's just go ahead and save this.\nOkay, now we can move on to thumbnails.\nAnd here, this allows us to create a thumbnail.\nAnd this actually allows us to we can save these different thumbnails.\nSo, we can basically just like workshop all of our different ideas, right?\nWe can create variations of this thumbnail because that had some interesting text on it.\nI want to change a different one.\nAnd so, we can just save these.\nVibe Studio.\nVibe Studio.\nAnd so, here's a cool thumbnail.\nSo, I can hit save.\nAnd so, now I can actually download not one but two.\nOr if I wanted to, I could download a third because on YouTube it's really important to do ABC testing for videos.\nAnd I think that is just incredibly important.\nAnd then I can also go to story beats which allows me to like fully outline my video.\nAnd so obviously it allows us to do the hook.\nWe can do some challenges and we can also edit these.\nSo trying to set the Vibe Studio and struggling to automate everything in the beginning obstacles and we basically just want to go through all of these.\nAnd now we can actually see how our video will actually show up on the feed, which is incredibly useful because your audience is going to always be comparing your video to other people's videos.\nAnd then I can also add any notes that I want to all of the steps when it comes to creating highquality long-form video.\nAnd that's just how Spotter Studio just helps me stay fully organized when creating long-form content.\nRight now, Spotter Studio is running a limited time summer deal.\nYou get a yearly membership to Spotter Studio for only $99.\nThat's over 80% off the original price.\nStart your free trial right now by clicking the link in the description to capture this limited summer offer and start making more hit videos on your channel.\nSo, after doing a lot of research, this was kind of the hardware setup that we have.\nSo, we have three cameras.\nAnd so, these are just like cinematic Blackmagic cameras.\nBlackmagic has really good um built-in like camera switching.\nRight now, we're just doing a multi-corder recording.\nSo, I'm just recording everything at once and then we're just doing all the work post.\nAnd that's another theme that I really want to get on.\nIf you're trying to optimize for AI to do a lot of the automations, I think you should start off doing everything manually and then you should one by one replace the steps with AI if that makes sense.\nAnd so that's what we're doing.\nBut over time, right, because these monitors are plugged into an ATM, which I'll get to in a second, we're going to be able to like do auto switching based on who's talking and we can do a lot of the the manual work automatically using AI tools and using macros and using the uh data that comes in from the microphone.\nBut so we have three Blackmagic cameras.\nWe have these three lights, and so they're Nanite Forza 150 lights, and they are pointed down.\nI'm not an expert on lighting.\nUm, we're going to bring in some experts to come in and help optimize everything.\nMaybe we're going to get some new lenses for the cameras.\nI'm not sure about that.\nBut we also have this ATM.\nSo, ATM.\nAnd what this allows us to do is that we have four input HDMI ports that we can plug into the computer and they get uh run into this ATM and then plugged into our Windows computer that's basically recording all of these and at the same time.\nAnd so that we have all of these different tracks being recorded cuz I think the screen share is the most important thing.\nAnd we also have a monitor so that when we're doing multi-person recordings, everyone, no matter what table you're sitting at, you're going to be able to see the person's screen uh whoever is um kind of using their computer at the time.\nAnd that can be controlled by our producer who isn't here today.\nUh normally I'll have a content producer and they'll be controlling checking the audio levels of everyone while they're recording.\nAnd I think it's really important for me.\nI like having someone in here while I'm recording so I'm not just rambling.\nUm but even for podcasts, like you want to make sure your audio is good.\nYou want to make sure that everyone's recording at the same time.\nSo having someone in the producer chair is very important.\nFor software, we are using the Windows computer.\nSo we're running Windows and then we also have V-Mix.\nSo V-Mix uh has all of the tracks.\nSo all the audio tracks and the video tracks recording at the same time.\nYou can record in two settings, right?\nYou can record in multi-corder mode and you can just record like which is a lot like um you know in Premiere Pro you have all these like sequences you have all these levels to it and it shows up as like the main uh composition and so you can record that and uh you could have someone manually switch between like whoever's speaking and it's just like recording that one or you can record everything at once and so to be safe uh while we're setting up our system we're recording everything at once.\nNow we will be optimizing this.\nI still think we're just going to record everything at once using the multicorder.\nWe may get a bigger attempt which will actually record it and save everything to an external hard drive and then it will go uh and then we'll record this like sequence.\nBut I think we're going to be able to figure out a way to get AI to automatically edit everything that we record.\nAnd so it'll just basically save all of these files.\nSo if if we have three people in here and we're doing an episode, right, we have three video files that will have the person's audio connected, right?\nSo camera two right there would be pointed at this chair.\nThe mic will be recorded will be from that camera will be plugged into the camera itself.\nAnd so then we'll have three video tracks of person one, person two, and person three.\nAnd we may even get a fourth camera that kind of films everyone so that we have a close-up camera on the main person or the person sitting in this seat because I think it's cool to have a view of everyone sitting here.\nAnd it's kind of casual.\nIt's kind of fun.\nYeah.\nAnd so we're going to record all of that.\nAnd then let's say all three of those people were recording their screen.\nThose should all be recorded in the same track.\nCurrently, the way that we have it set up, we have this ATM and they plugs in and it only records one of the tracks.\nSo the person who's sitting in the chair switches between whose computer is visible.\nAnd I think we can switch that so that it just records all of them.\nBut maybe we don't want to do that.\nLike maybe we don't need to record all three at the same time.\nMaybe we do.\nThat's up for debate.\nBut the point of this podcast is the screen sharing.\nI think being very tactical and explaining things, even if that means if we're like describing a concept, right?\nI really like um Excaladraw and I've taken a lot of inspiration from Mickey who was on my podcast a few days ago or like I think a couple weeks ago where you explain topics visually and so I've gotten really good at using like Excaladraw and like really understanding like these like shortcuts that allow you to create like these highquality graphics, right?\nbecause you can, you know, I'm not really creating anything right now, but I think it's just like a really engaging way to share stories and do processes, right?\nLike, so we have the vibe studio and, you know, we have hardware and we have software and then we have the system, right?\nAnd the system is actually the most important part and it encapsulate all of this, right?\nAnd all of this in these this system, we have specific goals, right?\nSee, it's just a fun way of kind of sharing stories and just explaining things.\nYeah.\nAnd so as soon as we're done with these videos for certain types of episodes, I send them to our new editing team and they handle everything manually.\nBut simultaneously to this, we're also um working with another editor um so that we can actually get an idea of the full process so we know how to automate things.\nAnd so we're\n\n\nBasically using Descript because Descript allows you to just upload as many tracks to the timeline as you want and you can move things around while maintaining the proper aspect ratio or the resolution of all the individual tracks.\nAnd that is really, really useful.\nAnd so one thing I think people get wrong with content and marketing in general is they try to automate everything upfront.\nAnd what this causes is you to just like create a high quantity of like really lame things.\nLike people who've never created a podcast before are like, \"Why don't you just automate everything in your podcast?\"\nAnd they're like, \"You've clearly never made a podcast before.\"\nAnd I'm not saying that we can't automate like 98% of the work over a long enough time horizon like a year.\nWe could probably automate 90% of the labor that goes into the post-production and the pre-production, which I'm going to talk about next.\nBut I still think you have to set up your entire system, right?\nThe same way that we have this Vibe Studio, we have hardware and software and we have this system of like, you know, like we record the tracks, then we're doing the I call like cutting, right?\nSo like we're putting the tracks into a timeline and then we're cutting those timelines.\nWe're cutting out the part that we don't like and then we're doing arranging and then we're doing like that's basically where like I'm either full screen talking to the camera or I'm in screen share mode and someone has to manually go in and change it depending on what's going on in the screen.\nNow the question becomes like, uh, can I do this with AI?\nAnd the answer to that, um, like is 100% yes.\nBut you should always be asking like at what quality or rather like at what percentage success can you do this?\nAnd like right now, right, if you were to have a multi-track sequence that you cut onto Descript, Premiere Pro or whatever, if you wanted to do the arranging, there are some tools that you can do it or we could build our own in-house tool that arranges everything automatically based on our brand assets, right?\nBecause part of this arranging, there was a long step before which was branding.\nAnd so if you look at my videos, they are branded in a specific way.\nAnd so you basically take all your brand assets and it's very repetitive at this point because we've already determined the brand and that's part of the arranging.\nAnd so after you have that, you could have an AI basically arrange your sequences in such a way that like makes it look good every time depending on if you're doing a screen share, if you're looking at the camera.\nUm, and so I think this like percentage is pretty low.\nLike I just don't think it's going to be that good.\nI think it would end up being more work for the editor, but I know companies like Tela, I know Descript's working on this.\nI know Premiere Pro or Adobe's working on this.\nAnd I know some other companies that are working on these screen share demo style kind of auto arranging.\nI think Riverside might be working on it a little bit.\nIt's just not quite that good.\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're just going to um do this manually.\nAnd then as time goes on, we're going to continue to test and we're going to see if we can get this high enough so that we can fully rely on it.\nAnd I think by the end of this year, there's a good chance we're we have that fully automated, right?\nSo we have we record tracks, we cut, we arrange, and then we have like editing.\nLike this is like basically like really going through making sure that everything's running smoothly.\nThis is still kind of tedious.\nLike and I'm I can just call this like tedious editing, right?\nThis includes like audio optimization.\nAnd then we move into something onscreen educational graphics, right?\nThis is something that I want to do a lot and someone that I uh take inspiration a lot from is Jayl Klouse.\nHe has really interesting lists pop up on the screen that really build his brand.\nIt has his blue colors on the screen as he's talking and I always find it really engaging and so I want to create that.\nAnd so, right, if you have an editor, right?\nIf you have, if you think about it, you have an editor and this editor has a finite amount of time, right?\nSo, this is your editor's time.\nWhat you want is you want most of the editor's time to be in in in this because like you have the on-screen graphics and then you have the like you have the music, you also have the optimized intro, which is like the most important part of the video.\nAnd often it's kind of like cinematic.\nIt's it's faster pace.\nIt really gets people locked into the video.\nAnd so, yeah, you want your really talented team members to be spending most of your time in this taste zone and not doing these boring menial tasks.\nI want to have 99% of this stuff right here fully automated.\nAnd I want to have 95% of the work uh from short form clips that come from these long uh these longer videos to be automated by AI.\nAnd I want them to be uploaded to Buffer automatically.\nSo I can just wake up and I want my morning routine every morning to just approve or reject short form clips.\nSo I can just watch them.\nI can spend 20 minutes watching the clips that were made by AI automatically and I can reject them.\nWhen I reject them then they will go to a human editor.\nEventually we may replace that.\nBut ideally we have like a 90 to 95% success rate that they're like, \"Yep, that works.\nThat can go on LinkedIn.\nBoom, boom, boom.\"\nbecause we're going to be going for quantity on short form platforms and then quality on the long form platforms because if you create really high quality videos, I think you can get AI to create really high quality clips as well.\nI also want all of my pro my research on the entire AI landscape like what people are interested in to be fully automated.\nSo, at the uh at the beginning of the day after I approve all those clips, I also want to get a research report that's actually like really high quality on our competitors on other creators in my niche in the AI business space.\nI want to know what people are talking about.\nI want to know what people are struggling with so we know what tutorials to make.\nAnd I want some of that to even be automated to give us outlines for future videos that we should create, different ways to express our ideas.\nAnd then I want to fully automate our thumbnail design and ideas and concepts.\nI think I'm going to keep my current thumbnail designer cuz he's like really, really good.\nBut like we should he should have like 20 ideas when he starts out because a lot of his time is spent in the ideation phase.\nI want him generating more thumbnails in the time that we're hiring him.\nAnd so if we can ideulate through the best ideas and come up with similar videos but also just face swap my face onto them, similar to the Mr. be tool that he released recently.\nI really want to automate that.\nAnd so if a lot of his work is just tweaking that and making them perfect, I think that would be a really cool thing to have automated by the end of the year.\nAnd then finally, I want an AI to automate the process of like rotating.\nSo ABC testing, and then when the ABC testing of the three thumbnails is done, I want new thumbnails to go up.\nThose get tested and basically have an auto rotator um of like really high quality uh YouTube thumbnails that might actually be in the early part of next year.\nBut the cool part for you is I'm going to be doing all of this publicly and I'm going to be sharing it and making videos on it.\nSo, you'll see it right here on this channel.\nSubscribe if this is interesting to you.\nI'm really excited to build out the Vibe Studio and create so much highquality, highv value content.\nAnd I'll see you here for the next\n",
