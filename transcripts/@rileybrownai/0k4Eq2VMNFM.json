  "cleanText": "Imagine if your web browser remembered every single thing that you browse.\nAnd imagine if it remembered every single step of all of your workflows so that all you have to do is ask the AI agent within your web browser to do any task and it will do it.\nThat is what's coming very soon.\nIn this video, we're going to be comparing the different Vibe browser tools.\nWe're going to take a look at the features inside Perplexity's new Comet.\nAnd then finally, we're going to talk about what it means to have a state-of-the-art AI agent in your web browser.\nLet's just dive into the video.\nThis is going to be a fun one.\nAnd before we dive into the browser wars comparing the main tools, I want to give a concrete example of Comet.\nI talked about DIA in my last video if you're interested.\nAnd the OpenAI browser is just a rumor, but it's 100% coming within the next few weeks because Google's stock is already tanking.\nAnd it just makes perfect sense that OpenAI would release a browser.\nBut right now, I want to talk about Comet, not as like a you should use this, but I really want you to get a good idea of what a Vibe browser or an AI agent within a browser looks like and feels like.\nIt is a combination of a familiar interface with an AI agent interface here on the right.\nAnd that is what Andre Karpathy has been talking about a lot.\nHe talked about it in this talk where you have a fast feedback loop between a familiar interface and an AI agent that basically is keeping track of all of the keystrokes, all of the things that you're doing.\nIt's learning and soon it's going to become more proactive and that's how we get the the kind of the Jarvis of the future.\nSo let's talk about this.\nObviously it is Perplexity, right?\nIt's a Perplexity simple interface.\nWe can search things.\nUh we can say um what did Andre Carpathy talk about in his Y combinator thing, right?\nAnd it will just give it to us straight right here, the evolution of software 1.0, know, etcetera, etcetera, standard Perplexity uh response.\nAnd so this is cool, right?\nObviously you have Perplexity, right?\nNothing new.\nOpenAI or ChatGPT can do this, Claude can now do this, but what it can't do is say, \"Please uh go to LinkedIn and post uh this uh but condense it to four sentences, no emojis or hashtags.\"\nAnd so now you see it says working.\nCheck this out.\nIf we click on this right here, we see that this in this little side browser, it navigated to LinkedIn.\nNow it's writing the post.\nI don't know if you can see that.\nIt's very small on my screen.\nIt's now reasoning.\nI need to create a new LinkedIn post.\nAs you can see, it's actually pasted that post in.\nAnd boom.\nAnd if we go to a new tab by pressing command T, I can just go LinkedIn.\nAnd we can see here that if we go to my profile, we can see that it posted this for me.\nIt automatically posted it.\nAnd so that's basically what's going on here.\nOne thing that I really like about these Vibe browser tools is that you can at@mention different things that are open or your bookmarks.\nSo for the Andre Carpathy video, I can do at Andre Carpathy and enter it in.\nWith Perplexity, it doesn't seem to have really strong bookmarks or have really strong uh like you can't mention bookmarks like on DIA browser for example, which is a very similar idea and I think it's useful that we actually talk about this.\nSo this is forget Google and Microsoft.\nOpenAI maybe building the ultimate suite of apps, right?\nSo let's say that I am writing a Google uh I'm on Google docs and if you watch my last video you already saw this um if you go commande E it opens up this side panel I can not only go at and tag that article say uh write uh write five sentences on this um I can also for the next one right it's going to write this for me and I'll be able to um please write it right?\nIf you get it to write it in this format, you can very easily insert it, but you what you can also do here, what you can also do here is you can go at all open tabs and you can also at your bookmarks like my short form hooks, right?\nI can write short form hooks, I can go at um long form hooks.\nAll right.\nUm, and I can say, \"Please write in my voice.\"\nSo, I just gave it context of some of my content and the context of the rest of the tabs open.\nAnd so, that's actually my favorite feature out of DIA or Perplexity.\nLike, I absolutely love the fact that I can just at@mention all of my bookmarks because it turns my web browser and all the things that I consciously save into permanent memory that I can access at any given time.\nAnd this is just one pretty good example right here.\nHowever, the thing that I don't like about DIA is it doesn't have really strong AI models.\nI'm pretty sure this is GBT4.1 and it's just not great at writing yet.\nAnd so I still can't tell which web browser that I want to go to go with.\nBut yeah, you can like atmention things.\nAnd on this you can actually have it go do things.\nYou can say like please uh go to Amazon.\nUm, search for a new, I don't know, pen that is uh futuristic and uses AI somehow.\nPlease scroll until you find three.\nAnd you literally can basically just send an AI agent to go do tasks for you while you are on your main tab.\nAnd you can see here it's browsing something or it's browsing Amazon.\nIt's taking advantage of Prime Day and it's going off and doing things for you.\nAnd so that's basically what's going on here, right?\nOver time, very very quickly, this AI aspect of this web browser is going to get more and more powerful.\nProbably to the point where it gets so powerful that you just you don't even really need the web browser portion.\nThe AI is going to be able to do so much for you.\nThat is what I want to talk about today.\nThat's what I want to really dive into some of the details and kind of compare these different tools.\nDIA was the first one to launch.\nThey launched a little over a week ago now and um I've been in their beta for like 2 weeks and a lot of people really like it.\nBut I will say Comet is stealing the show and I guarantee you OpenAI when they release their browser within the next week, they are going to steal the show from Perplexity.\nAnd so one thing that OpenAI released last year, they released Operator and deep research.\nAnd so you can think of deep research as basically a PhD level researcher that can go off and research things and it will decide when it's done researching.\nAnd that's what makes it so agentic, right?\nAn agent is a model that uses tools in a loop.\nAnd so if you're losing tools in a loop, it's not just going to use tools in a loop forever.\nThe agent will actually decide when to stop using tools.\nAnd the same goes for operator, which is a browser use agent, which is very similar to what you saw with Perplexity.\nPerplexity has an operator, right?\nI'm just calling it operator.\nThat's the name OpenAI gave operator, but we're just going to call it operator, which is just a browser use agent.\nAnd Perplexity also has deep research and their deep research has access to many different models.\nYou can use Deep Seek 1, you can use OpenAI's models, you can use Claude's models, you can use any AI model.\nUh they just added Grock 4.\nUh DIA is free, right?\nOur cheapest plan is $200 per year to get access to Comet.\nMaybe there's free, but like I don't think you get access to all the features for free.\nBut DIA seems to be free, but I do think they're going to add a premium uh plan with the different AI models, which I would pay for.\nAnd so these three tools, DIA, Comet, and ChatGPT have features that are somewhat similar.\nAnd that is skills, spaces, and projects.\nIf you're in DIA, you can actually press slash and you have access to basically like custom prompts, right?\nAnd so let's say that I'm watching a YouTube video on DIA and it's this video right here.\nThis is the this is the demo.\nWe press command E and we what we can do is we can actually create custom uh this is quote summary.\nSo this just grabs the most important quotes from the video and it just puts them in a line.\nAnd obviously it's not numbering them properly, but this is just a custom summary format.\nAnd I have another one which is summary quick which is a very short summary that I can use at any given time.\nAnd this is just a way to access certain AI powers really quickly in in comet.\nUm I forget which ones I even have.\nThey have what's called spaces.\nIt's very similar.\nUm this is like AING.\nThis is basically my AI agent that um uh explains things really simply.\nSo I can say explain AI agents and the custom prompt within this.\nRight?\nIf we were to open up a new tab here and we were to open up spaces in aing, um if we were to go into our custom prompt, if we hit settings, um it's like you're a you are an expert explainer specifically on the topic surrounding AI.\nSo I can very quickly access this system prompt and any other files that I upload to this like almost like a ChatGPT project or a Claude project.\nIt's very similar.\nYou can basically um have access to it at any time.\nAll you have to do is press at and it's very similar to the way that you at mention on DIA.\nChatGPT has projects and it's very similar and I guarantee you they're going to be carrying that into their web browser and it wouldn't actually surprise me if ChatGPT just didn't become a browser because I think that they just want to keep people on that platform.\nAnd so that's what I mean by skills, spaces, and projects.\nThey all have different ways that maintain different types of memory and system prompts depending on the task that you want to do at any given time.\nIf we compare the amount of users, right?\nObviously Chrome has 2.5 billion roughly weekly active users and OpenAI has weekly 800 million weekly active users.\nThey are growing by far the fastest.\nThe same way that Google Chrome in just a few years took over the browser market.\nChatGPT is doing the same thing to them again.\nAnd so obviously in late 2022 we were introduced to ChatGPT and then you know in 2023 and 2024 we had separate experiences.\nWe had ChatGPT and we had Google and a lot of things was going to a web browser copying and pasting things pasting them into ChatGPT getting some summaries pasting it back into Google and it's kind of this like kind of this slow process and the were two separate entities and now with this VI browsing revolution we get a very nice you put them together basically we put together this web browser with this AI chat feature and they're very much related, right?\nYou can highlight something on Perplexity, right?\nIn Perplexity, right?\nLet's say I were to copy this, right?\nIf I highlight this, look, it shows up right here, and it immediately puts it into context.\nUh, on top of this, right, on top of this, let's go to an interesting part.\nSo, this is a slide.\nIf I were to press this button right here, this is a screenshot on Perplexity.\nAnd I could say please uh like do additional research, right?\nAnd it would have context of that image.\nAnd so it's very much uh intermingling these chat features and the browser feature.\nAnd it's the same exact process on DIA, right?\nDIA has this camera thing.\nIt's like click to drag.\nAnd this has like a snap feature.\nIt's actually pretty solid the way it does that.\nThey have a really good design and then you can just very quickly reference things.\nSo the feedback loop and the just kind of the speed of usage between the browser and the chat is becoming like that.\nAnd obviously in Perplexity's case uh you can literally browse just by telling a basically a separate browser instance to go off and browse for you which is really really cool.\nAnd this is kind of another shift.\nAnd so this little side panel right here is still reactive, right?\nYou still have to go to it and tell it what you want it to do.\nYou have to tell it to go browse stuff.\nIt's not yet proactive.\nBut mark my words, that's exactly where this is going.\nRight?\nI was reading an article today that said these companies are aiming to transform browsers from passive tools into proactive assistants that anticipate user needs which they can deliver smarter and more tailored experiences than Chrome has yet to fully embrace for now, right?\nWe'll see if Chrome responds to these tools.\nThey basically have to.\nAnd the way their whole product team is set up now.\nYou've I've seen Google completely turn it around and they are now innovating as fast as OpenAI.\nGemini and Claude are both rapidly advancing in terms of revenue and I anticipate it's going to get much more competitive from those players as well.\nSo, what will Open AI's browser do, right?\nWhat will the features be?\nAnd I really want you to think about this because you might have heard of all of the things that I'm about to say, but have you ever wrapped your head around what it means to have all of them in one single tool?\nIn my opinion, the way that ChatGPT is moving as it becomes a browser, it will become a business.\nYou and ChatGPT are a business, right?\nWhy do businesses exist?\nBusinesses exist because it's more efficient to have many people working together, right?\nThe sum of all the people working together on a problem is greater than its parts.\nAnd you know, you don't have time to learn accounting, to learn design, to learn how to build a product, to do marketing, and to do all these different things.\nWell, ChatGPT as it gets smarter will allow you to become a business in and of yourself, and you can just move a lot faster.\nYou don't have to set up meetings.\nYou don't have to talk to people.\nYou can just take action.\nYou can learn anything because let's talk about their features, right?\nChatGPT is a web browser, right?\nIt is an AI that can use a browser and it can run many instances of a web browser, right?\nIf you remember operator, it takes control of your browser.\nIt can go off and do tasks.\nIt is also a deep researcher.\nObviously, it has normal web uh web search, but it can already research for up to like 45 minutes depending on how hard your research question is.\nAnd it is AI that can research like a PhD.\nAnd obviously with a tool like ChatGPT, it can answer any question.\nObviously with their image generation tool, it can create any visual, whether that is an image or an infographic, right?\nIt can speak to you.\nAnd then where it gets really really interesting is it can create documents.\nChatGPT\n\n\nT released a feature called canvas.\nAnd you can see it a little bit right here.\nWe can make this a little bit bigger.\nBut if you ask ChatGPT or if you ask Claude, they have the same feature, right?\nClaude has the same feature.\nI used it right here.\nThis is a little canvas, right?\nAnd you can highlight it and you can say explain, and like it's kind of this natural separation between your chat interface and kind of the work that you're working on.\nIn ChatGPT, you can actually directly edit it.\nYou can't type on this on Claude yet, which is kind of annoying; they should add that feature.\nBut the point is, you can create these little canvases.\nIf you use Gemini, right?\nGemini's feature where I'm pretty on my arc.\nIf I go to Gemini on gemini.google.com, create a canvas on a poem, right?\nIf you just ask it to create a canvas, it should.\nMaybe I have to.\nOkay, so I asked the AI to create a canvas.\nAnd now you can actually edit this right here on the side.\nAnd Gemini's interface has gotten a lot better.\nAnd what you can do is you can actually hit this share feature.\nYou can export it to docs.\nAnd ChatGPT can do this same exact thing where it can use a canvas, and soon, in OpenAI, you're going to be able to add it to their version of Google Docs.\nSo, not only did OpenAI hire two former Chrome founding team members, they're also building, right, they are building the ultimate work suite of apps and services.\nSo, they are literally building Google, the equivalent to Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, and I believe I would anticipate there will add a mail.\nAnd the same way that Google copied Microsoft, they're going to be building a full office suite; they already added a granola-like feature.\nSo granola is a notetaker.\nWell, OpenAI copied that exact feature as well.\nSo it seems to me that they're going after the kind of office suite.\nAnd so yeah, that's kind of the direction they're going.\nIt can do all of these things.\nThen pretty soon, not only will it be able to do all types of research, answer any of your questions, create, speak, and create documents for you and create sheet, slides, and mail, right?\nNot only is it going to be able to research or answer your question, create any visual or speak to you, it will be able to create any document for you in the file type that you need.\nAnd as a thought experiment, I really wanted to talk about now versus one year from now.\nAs a thought experiment, right?\nAs you know, if you've used deep research, right?\nDeep research on ChatGPT, how good is it doing research?\nAnd I would say it's pretty good now.\nLike I would say it's a six or seven out of 10.\nTyler Cowan, who is an economist, he talks about how his deep research is actually better than some of his research assistants.\nBut a lot of people think that it is very good at doing research.\nNow, if you used Operator, you know that it's not very good at controlling a computer.\nIt doesn't really have good context of where it's at, right?\nWhich is you know, very similar to this Comet thing.\nIt's just like go to LinkedIn and please draft a post.\nDon't post it.\nJust type it of this.\nAnd in this window that opens up right here on Perplexity, I would show you on ChatGPT, but I just got a new MacBook and I'm not even signed in.\nOkay, there you go.\nSo when this thing pops up and it says working, that means it is using the browser agent.\nAnd so this is what I'm talking about.\nThis is what it means to browse an to like actually browse.\nSo here it's actually typing something on LinkedIn for me while I work, right?\nYou don't even need to have this open.\nIdeally, this gets so good that you don't even need to like really keep tabs on it.\nIt'll just be like, \"Yeah, buddy.\nI got you.\nI posted it.\nDon't worry about it.\"\nAnd it's just like, \"Oh, okay.\nThat's pretty damn cool.\"\nAnd you can see here that it is lined up.\nI don't think it's actually posted it, but it's still not great, right?\nIt can do like four or five steps of a thing, but it forgets where it's at, right?\nIt doesn't have really good context.\nThere's another tool that I've been that I've used.\nIt's called VI by Vers.\nVI.\nIt's like a computer use AI agent.\nIt literally controls your actual computer.\nIt doesn't just control your browser, but it's not very good.\nI'm going to be honest.\nAnd so, I personally think this is going to get a lot better very, very fast.\nIt's already gotten better in the last 6 months, but I've been talking to companies who are working on this problem, and there's a lot of innovations coming around the corner to basically allow for the agent to have like spatial memory and know exactly what step it's on and be able to retrace its steps and know what the next step is to be.\nCuz right now it's just kind of getting lost.\nImagine in a year, right?\nWhat happens if in one year it becomes better than 99% of humans at doing research and controlling a computer?\nMeaning it could just fly through web pages much faster.\nIt could memorize long workflows, right?\nAs you can see here, like I set up this research by like copying and pasting things from around the internet into this Figma board.\nI drag them around this canvas, organize them in an interesting way.\nImagine if an AI agent could do the same thing, right?\nImagine if an AI agent could actually like I think that would be really cool if it could copy and paste things that it thought that I would think are interesting and pasted them on a canvas.\nMaybe it leaves me little comments for what I think would be interesting.\nI think that would be like a really fascinating and super useful tool.\nNow, what does that mean for a lot of people?\nI think that would scare a lot of people because like most people who went to college went there to build expertise, right?\nTo build knowledge and to be able to do things in a company that requires a computer, right?\nYou are using your knowledge through a computer.\nAnd what we're doing in this specific case is we're basically teaching an AI, right?\nIt can already answer any question for you.\nBut like you're like, \"Yeah, but you know, I'm safe because you know AIs don't know how to actually do this stuff.\nIt might have knowledge, but it can't actually do anything.\"\nYeah, well that might not last very long, right?\nIf you can teach an AI to use that same knowledge that it has in ChatGPT and you could exert that knowledge into using a computer, right, which I think it's on pace to.\nI think by mid 2026 it's going to be a 10 out of 10 at controlling a computer.\nLike I actually believe that maybe even by the end of 2025.\nLike who knows?\nWe are one leap away.\nAnd the implications of that are insane.\nAbsolutely insane.\nWe are in a massive shift right now.\nWe are in a massive shift.\nAnd it started off, you know, like as you can see here from like 2010 to like 2018, we saw Chrome just like take over the browsing market.\nAnd right now, like over the past, I would say 5 years, we've seen a shift from a lot of the way that people interface with the internet have just become really social.\nPeople are using TikTok to search.\nPeople are using Instagram to search.\nPeople are using X to search.\nRight?\nI keep up with AI advancements and adoption mostly through X, like 90% of it, because that's where all of the smart people are hanging out and posting things in real time.\nAnd it has just become a better source of information than Google, which basically just serves me ads all the time.\nAnd so, we're kind of going through this third shift from like browsers to social to chat.\nAnd then now we're gonna kind of get this like weird merger between AI chat and browsing, right?\nIt's it's it's this weird phenomenon.\nAnd we don't fully know what this looks like yet, but we do know it's powerful.\nWe know that browsing is essential.\nPeople still use browsers all the time.\nMore people use browsers.\nMore people are using Chrome than ChatGPT by a lot, right?\nAs we saw earlier up here, right, we see 2.5 billion weekly active users on Chrome, 800 million on ChatGPT.\nBut if this was left alone, ChatGPT is going to pass Chrome within the next year or two, right?\nAnd so a lot of companies are asking themselves right now.\nThey're like, \"Okay, what do we do?\"\nRight?\nHow do we show up on these browsers?\nAnd in the future, I'm going to make a video on kind of large language model optimization.\nThis is a new trend that requires probably an hour-long video and I'll probably bring someone on to talk about it on a future episode of the podcast because I don't know much about it.\nI do know that you probably want to show up on popular publications.\nYou probably want to show up there and you probably want to be talked about in public, right?\nI have a startup, the Vibe Code app, and I want people to know about it, right?\nI'm in charge of its marketing.\nAnd I think it's important to get out there and kind of intermingle your brand with other brands and and really get out there because AI is going to be searching the internet, right?\nPeople are going to be interfacing with the chat, and as we saw with the Perplexity example, AI is going to be searching the internet.\nMost of the entities searching the internet is AI.\nAnd so the whole paradigm of search engine optimization is going to be flipped on its head.\nWe don't know exactly how it will be flipped on its head, but that's why we have this channel.\nI'm going to be talking about it in the future.\nAnd the way that I see the most successful people handle the AI revolution in general, and I think it would stand for this transformation from this like chat paradigm to this browser chat paradigm is just to become a business.\nNot only become a business but become a content creator.\nIt is now more risky to get a job than it is to become a founder or entrepreneur.\nAnd that's because of all of this futuristic technology, right?\nBusinesses don't want to take the risk of bringing on too many humans if you don't know what role you're hiring for.\nLike if you're asking yourself, will my job be safe?\nJust know that like if you're worried, if you're playing defense, right?\nIf you're playing defense and you're worried about these agentic browsers that can go off and do tasks for you, you're already doing something wrong.\nYou need to attack through it.\nDo not be cynical about it and just learn how to use these tools effectively to always be connecting or ABC.\nAnd so this is something that I've been talking about, right?\nYou always want to be finding connections through all of your life's experiences.\nAnd you want to find connections between like AI content and certain marketing principles and then also like take concepts from poker, which is one of my other interests.\nAnd you want to focus on being human, finding connections, things that AIs aren't likely to find.\nAnd you want to make sure that you're not just doing repetitive behaviors on a computer because that's exactly what AI is getting really, really good at.\nAnd so you can use these AI search these AI-powered vibe browsing tools to just rapidly accelerate the speed at which you learn.\nAnd if you just focus on like being really fast, delivering high-quality work, and using AI across the board, you will make it.\nYou will be fine.\nIt's going to be such an exciting time in the world of AI.\nAnd every single tool that we know of is going to is going to kind of transition into something like this where you have this familiar web browser or familiar interface, right?\nThis is going to be Adobe.\nAdobe is going to literally be this, right?\nYou have this familiar video editing platform.\nYou'll have your timeline down here with all your tracks, and then you'll have an AI agent that can go out and control everything, right?\nAnd if your tools are built in such a way that it can't do this, your software tools are in trouble.\nThat's just the way it works.\nAnd it's going to What an exciting time.\nAnyway, that was just a quick little video on the browser wars, all the different tools and the transition.\nAnd yeah, I'll see you here in the next video.\n",
