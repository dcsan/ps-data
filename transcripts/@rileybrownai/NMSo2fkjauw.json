  "cleanText": "AI generated images and videos are taking over the internet, and I don't think people realize how easy it is to build apps that use this technology.\nAnd there are people making all the way up to 150K per month using these APIs.\nAnd in this video, we're going to talk about how you, without any coding experience, can actually build apps and how you can actually test and compare all of these images and video models to best create an experience that uses this AI technology in a novel way.\nLet's just dive straight into the video.\nOkay.\nSo, this is going to be a real time image editing platform that you can make with Replicate.\nSo, let's say let's generate an image of a unicorn.\nOh, wow.\nThe loading.\nLet's wow.\nMake this a 90s character style.\nLet's give this unicorn a rainbow mane.\nAnd let's give it two horns.\nThis is awesome.\nI'm going to show you some examples, some more examples of how you can sort of play around with some of the parameters that are exposed.\nUm, but this is just like a really simple app that one of our Replicate staff members just Vibe Coded in in a couple of hours.\nWe used OpenAI real time API.\nUm, that's what gets us to just like have a natural conversation with the app and Flux Context Max.\nSo that's doing the image editing.\nThe image creation is Flux Chanel also on Replicate.\nUm, and yep, all created in cursor.\nWe just pop in the Replicate API docs and there you go.\nThat's amazing.\nI love it.\nAll right.\nSo, this is the explore page of Replicate.\nI love how you described it, Riley.\nIt's just like kind of like an app store for all the latest AI models where you can just see what's what's the latest.\nYou can test them super quickly.\nYou can fine-tune models.\nYou can put up your own models, which is something that not a lot of People know about.\nYou can we provision GPUs for your models so you don't have to worry about any of the backend infrastructure.\nUm but if you want to use one of the latest like state-of-the-art models, we've have quite a few of them featured here.\nSo like for instance, Bite Dance just came out with video and image models.\nWe have Cling, we have Google, we have V3, which has been super super huge.\nUm ID, Black Force Labs, Flux models.\nThese are all just like our featured main ones right now.\nAnd then we have official models.\nSo we even have like your open AI models like we have one, we have GPT 4.1, GPT40, like all of these you can sort of just access all these state-of-the-art models with one singular API key.\nAnd I think that's like the biggest draw of Replicate is you don't have to like go to OpenAI, you don't have to go to Anthropic and test them all out.\nYou can just stay here and sort of plug and play with all of them.\nYeah.\nAnd for those of you who are watching who are completely untechnical, what's important to understand is like all of these have an input and an output.\nThese are AI models that you can plug into any workflow that you want.\nSo whether you want to build an app and sell it commercially right here, you can see that this has a text prompt.\nAnd so this is the the example prompt for this one looks like the sun slowly between tall buildings, etc., etc., etc.\nAnd it allows you to just type in a prompt and you get this video.\nAnd if you can create an app or come up with some interface as he showed previously with the voice input, right?\nAnd interfaces are incredibly important whether you're on web or Mobile App, you can create these User Interfaces that make using this technology more more fun, more useful.\nYou can give them access to AI agents who can actually go out and use these.\nThat's kind of what he's showing you right now is there's inputs and there's outputs and these different models yield different inputs, different outputs for different costs.\nAnd so these are all decisions you have to make when designing a Creative AI Tool.\nAnd yeah, I just wanted to uh provide a little bit of context there.\nSo this is what we call model page.\nWhen you click onto a model, you can see all the different parameters.\nSo like for instance, this is a video model.\nWe have prompt.\nWe have starting image if you wanted to pass in like a key frame that your video starts from and then creates the image from there.\nDuration, resolution, aspect ratio.\nYou can just sort of plug and play with all of these and then get different outputs.\nAs for pricing, we are super transparent about pricing and we clearly list what prices look like.\nSo for instance, uh this Bite Dance model is is 3 cents per second of output video.\nAnd um you know we and these are for different resolutions as well.\nSo 480p versus 1080p are different prices.\nUm, so yeah, you know, we have all the information here just for like you to test out what whatever works for you, whatever works for your use case.\nAnd you know, you can just sort of in our search for instance, you don't even have to know the type of model that you're looking for.\nLike I I'm looking for a video model, but I don't know what's called seed dance one, for instance.\nOr maybe I'm looking to edit images, but I don't know what these these models are called.\nYou can literally just type in your use case.\nSo let me do just like edit edit image and we've created collections for you to just sort of browse through and curated a bunch of these models that you can just see like what works for your use case.\nSo we have some recommendations right now.\nFlux context and flux cont flux context pro and flux context max are really big for image editing as well as ideoggram 3 is really good for text and typography stylistic changes.\nWe have a few here, but you can just sort of go through this kind of app store of models and see what works for your for your use case.\nQuick break to tell you about the app that Vibe Coded Mobile Apps in just seconds.\nWe've been working on this app for the past 4 months straight.\nAll you need is an idea.\nYou just type your app idea and it will build a native Mobile App right on your phone.\nIt connects with cursor or any other IDE.\nYou can create games, AI powered productivity apps, and we even have an NAN integration that lets you build apps powered by AI agents.\nYou can download the app at vibecodeapp.com or use the link in the description cuz obviously right now there's only so much information you can get navigating through these model pages.\nI think it's very useful to see the inputs, the outputs.\nIt's a great place to get started.\nBut like if you're let's say you're a content creator and maybe you're not even trying to build an app.\nMaybe you're trying to create the best thumbnails and you're trying to find what technology makes the best thumbnails.\nThe way that I do it is I go into Playground and I you can add models to your playground and you can actually test them side by side and they show up in the grid and you can see which model created what.\nSo you can kind of have this like AB testing of like what models are performing best for whatever it is that you want to create.\nYeah, this is Playground.\nSo, this is basically your space to test out all the latest state-of-the-art models and see like, you know, what works well for certain use cases and what doesn't and just like side by side compare things.\nSo, for instance, with video models, like a big thing People want to test is physics.\nLike, is a video model good at simulating an Olympic gymnast diving off a diving board or flipping off of a balance beam?\nSo, I just wanted to go ahead and test like is Cling better, is V3 better, is Bite Dance's new model better, like what is what is doing well for for physics?\nAnd you can just see like all the different outputs.\nI can click one and see that this used uh v2.1 master from Cling and this happened to be like the best at the physics um for me.\nBut it's just like the best way to test like you can see we have all the different models you can put into your own version of Playground.\nSo I've loaded all these ones up here for testing and yeah and even here I was just testing out different outputs from this is Google's Image and Video Models and 3 model for image um we have Blackforce Labs flux pro um 3 again and flux dev.\nSo, just like seeing, you know, just like super quickly like what what are the the best best models here?\nAnd what's cool and what I've noticed that and I've talked to a lot of People who've created AI Wrappers who make Millions of dollars per year.\nUm, a lot of the time they're actually chaining these together.\nThey find these subtle workflows.\nThat's kind of their edge.\nYou know, if they're they find some specific use case that they're good at generating and then they find like a specific workflow.\nSo, oftentimes the output of one model can be the input into the next model.\nSo, for example, if you were to just download, if you just press download on that squirrel image and you want to just toss that into the editor in the like Flux context because you generated that on image gen from Google, right?\nYou could upload that as the input image of another one and then you can edit that.\nAnd so, that's kind of the flow I get into is like you could say make the squirrel\nI'll just say like get rid of the flowers in the background for Flux context max.\nThis is our image editing model.\nAnd what's cool is you can run multiple of these at a time.\nLike you don't have to wait for it to finish.\nLike a lot of like I use some other tools.\nUm like you said, get rid of the flowers.\nYou can say make his hair green.\nYou can constantly change the prompt.\nI don't think People like creating YouTube thumbnails.\nUm they're kind of annoying to create.\nAnd for the first time, we're actually getting these affordable image editing models like Flux Context.\nIt's almost like having Photoshop in an AI model.\nIt can like locate the part of the video or the image that you want to edit.\nIt can change testing.\nI was just like testing ID is like huge for creating ads or like ad copy and just like really good with text and just I was creating like UGC ads for instance like you could toss this into a video model and create a UGC ad that you can post on Tik Tok or or whatever short form content platform you want to.\nAlso, one thing that um I don't think you touched on that I think is just like quite important is the recent predictions.\nThis will actually help you troubleshoot a lot.\nSo like if you're using it within an app, right, you can actually see all of your recent ones that go through.\nAnd if you click on I think if you just click on ID, you can see like you can see here.\nI just did a podcast with Matt Wolf and I was testing with the the different image models and we were testing upscalers.\nThis one is like really subtle.\nUm, but it's pretty fun to look back and you can actually see you can even click on that little like uh document with the magnifying glass to get like an at glance look.\nIt's right next to to the left of the ID.\nYeah, there you go.\nOh, lovely.\nI like that.\nCool.\nYeah.\nAnd you can see this one failed.\nAnd that could be for um this looks like it was an error in my Vibe Coding abilities.\nUm but it's good to be able to see that, right?\nBecause sometimes when you're Vibe Coding an app, you don't know if the error happened on like communicating with Replicate or if the error is just the app not displaying the image back into your app.\nAnd so it's it's always good to um kind of be able to um kind of know where what's wrong because then you can just tell the AI like it's showing up, it's it's succeeding, it's not an API issue, you're just not displaying it correctly and it'll usually fix the problem.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd so what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to go to um Playground.\nSo if I type in Playground, I don't know if that's the easiest way to find it.\nThat's just how I do it.\nWe can actually just So obviously, yeah, we can select a model.\nI'm going to use Flux Context Pro.\nAnd um like I want to be able to upload an image.\nLet's find an image of myself.\nHopefully I find one here pretty quickly somewhere.\nI'll just go to Twitter.\nI'll get my profile picture.\nI'll save this image.\nYeah, I always do the same exact thing when testing.\nI just don't know where it is.\nUm, okay.\nSo, we can just I believe we can just drag an image in right here.\nSo, we can just drag this image right there.\nSo, now we have this input image.\nUh, please make this a uh YouTube thumbnail of this person.\nI don't know if this prompt is the best.\num with text that says\nuh one\nor let's go yeah million\ndollar rapper\nand then uh we can change the aspect ratio because aspect ratio of a YouTube thumbnail is 16 by9 so you don't even though this is a square input it should change it to 16 by9 and obviously there's some other um things that you can edit we don't need to dive dive too far in detail there, but they're worth checking out.\nUm, some models have more parameters than others, but once we find just like an API that we like, like if we like this result, okay, million-dollar rapper for whatever reason, it um or we can say uh in the style of anime,\num\nI don't know, this is probably a bad prompt.\nUm,\nbut the point is what we can do.\nOh, okay.\nThat's not bad.\nYeah, not bad.\nNot bad.\nAnd then, um, what we can do here.\nUm, oh, I like the one the Yeah, million dollar rapper.\nThat's actually like legit not a bad I don't think it would really good.\nOkay, so we like this, right?\nWe like this.\nAll we need to do is just copy this, right?\nAll we need to do is copy this and um we're going to get I know that HTTP usually works the best because this is kind of like more universal actually.\nI'm very curious um what your take is on this.\nSo like you've probably seen a lot of People Vibe Code or even just code with these workflows.\nDo most People start off with kind of a front-end mockup and then adding the AI or do you think what do you think is better?\nOh, that's a good question and I feel like it might depend on your expertise level.\nSo, I would say like if you're just starting off, putting the API straight into your prompt is is going to work way better than you expect anyways.\nUm, like you're you're able to create a very high functioning app just within one or two prompts.\num like just the first prompt you get it working and then maybe you just have\n\n\nto kind of massage the UI a little bit. Like, you like, maybe I want it to be dark dark mode, or maybe I want the image input to be front and center, and I want the prompt box to be here. But usually, it just takes like three or three prompts. Um, but if you have like a really good idea of the UI, and you like, um, you know, you're a designer, or maybe even just like you could sketch it up on a post-it note and send that as part of your prompt as well. That works pretty well. Um, it just depends on like how comfortable you feel with like design. Um, but even if even if you're just a beginner, just the prompt works wonders. Yeah. Okay. Here's a fun hypothetical question for you. Let's say I'm completely untechnical. I'm watching this video right now. Maybe I don't like my job. I feel like I'm not able to use AI, and I want to use AI, right? And I want to create an AI Wrapper, and I want to create an app. Let's say I have like let's say two weeks, and maybe I have some spare time, and I can learn, um, you know, I can spend 10 total hours learning some skill to build an AI Wrapper that actually makes money. Like, how would you start to take the most like efficient path to creating an AI Wrapper that gets attention and maybe a few customers? I'm going to be so honest with you now with Vibe Coded tools. The number one skill I think you should be learning is marketing, like how to market and catch attention again, because Vibe Coded has made it so easy to make an app. Like, honestly, there's like no excuse. Like, you should just like toss in a Replicate API and then make an app, and it's so easy. Like, really, anyone can do it. And so now it's kind of like you get to expand more, like question-wise. Like, now you get to sort of think about like what kind of UIs or design choices do I want to make for my users? Like, you get to sort of be more creative now. Like, I think the leverage has shifted to creatives and like people were really thinking about design thinking or, um, how users experience platforms or marketing, like how can I best capture the users's attention and their problems, and you know, how can I create short form content that works really well? Um, you know, we're seeing like crazy, like the like, uh, Roy Lee, for instance, he's he's taking over mostly because of the marketing aspect, and I think it it makes everything more creative in a sense. Like, you get to really flex your creative muscles now versus before you really had to learn these technical skills, skills that didn't really like get your juices flowing like it does now. So, I would I would totally say marketing or like design or just like anything that really resonates with the user the most. And first of all, I really think marketing is incredibly important. Um, and like I've actually talked a lot about that on my channel. One thing I haven't talked about is actually design. Like, it's very obviously I want I want to say I'm good at design, right? I like good design, I think. But like to me, it's pretty unclear on how to even learn design. Like, what really well-designed apps have you seen created recently? And like, how can I actually go and like learn those? Like, is it just finding a bunch of examples of really good apps and trying to copy them? Like, what do you think? Honestly, I think that's a great starting point. Um, just like think about the apps that you use every day. So you use your iPhone, amazingly designed product, an iPhone. Um, Duolingo, another great example of just like a typical language learning app that has been really fine-tuned for good design. Siri, uh, Cursor, another like tool that was forked from VS Code, which already has great design. And so it's now more about like how is the user going to interact with the AI interface. I think like start starting from things that have already been built. You don't have to reinvent the wheel at all. Um, I think that's a that's a great starting point. And just talking to users, seeing how people use your app. Um, it's just a great, it's fun. Like, it's fun, and it's the best way because that's ultimately like you're you're putting a product in people's hands, and so you want to know how it's working. In the meantime, I could I could totally show you like one of my Vzero examples of using the exact same API. Go ahead and do that. Yeah, that'd be amazing. So I I personally like to use Vzero just because, um, and and literally I'm doing the same exact thing that you're doing. Um, so I wanted to create a modern web app for an Image editing platform. Uh, and I I just said using the Replicate API documentation of this Image editing API. And this is exactly the Flux Context Pro uh API that uh Riley is using. Um, state-of-the-art Image editing right now. Uh, I just copied and pasted the the docs that you would see just right if you go into we have our form. This is like what you first see. And then I just hit N.JS because all of your web apps are going to be in JavaScript or N.JS. And I just copy and paste this code snippet right here, which is the actual API run. Um, and I I then I just pass it over to to Vzero. Oh, not sure if you saw the the docs, but this is this is pretty much what you would copy and paste from. Oh, amazing. Amazing. From Replicate. Yeah. Um, I like Vzero because it automatically will ask for your token and store it. So, you can actually like run the app in in house. Um, but you can see like you can also track like all the different versions that you started off with. So, this was like the first version that came up uh with just this prompt.\nuh, was was this, and you can see like it it hits all of the parameters that are included in in the flux context API. So we have Image upload. This is where you type in your prompt. You can change the aspect ratio. You can change the output out output format, and then safety tolerance is something that will provision against, um, harmful outputs or harmful inputs for the prompt. Um, but this is this is what you get one shot, which is already amazing. So like literally the rest of my chat history is just fixing the UI and making sure it's like something that So you can see like this is the rest of my chat history. It asked for my Replicate API token, and it just added it right here. Um, so now it's like stored in this app, and I can run it natively. Um, you can see my next iteration.\nI said I want the UI to be like this, and I gave it a sample image. I'm not sure. Can you see that? Yes, I can. Amazing. Yeah. So, I gave it a sample image of just like a quick mockup of this is the image. The prompt box is underneath it. And I wanted to see my like edit history as a as a series of thumbnails underneath. And this this automatically worked. So, we can go to version two.\nAnd in version two, we have it exactly like how I set up. So, we have like our image input. We could type in whatever. So for instance, I can type in or I can put in the\num, let's do the ad.png.\nSo this is one of the ads that I created on Replicate. And we can transform this. We could say uh change the text reveal your radiance to let's say like cleanse cleanse your soul.\nAnd we'll just go ahead and hit generate and see what happens. So again, it's hitting the flux context API that's on Replicate. So we're using Replicates API here. You can see that it just changes your text right there for you. And you can see that we have our image history that's going to be stored in in a series. It's exactly how I sketched out my my image. That's amazing. That's amazing. And one thing that I've noticed, um, people do on these, um, like on apps is they like change the uh editing animation. I don't know. you want to try and make a change on this one and say like, uh, oh, I don't know if you can Oh, what's cool about VZ is you can actually like fork these. So, if you want to go off in different directions, you can hit the fork button up there at the top, and you could say like change the um editing animation. Um, and you can just find ways that makes the experience just better kind of. Um, which is really cool. Yeah, you can see in my like final version. Um, so let's see if I could go back to my previous versions. My final version ended up being this after I just like massaged out everything. I was like, I wanted a dark UI. Um, I wanted the UI to be a bit more clean and modern. Um, like pretty much was just like massaging out the best UI, and it it only took four prompts. Um, but yeah, you can fork this. You can change like, you know, I want a different editing animation. um, all that. So I I think it's a great platform to sort of test out these Replicate APIs with. What are you seeing as the most like popular APIs right now?\nThis again is the the explore page. So we've curated the the models that we think we see on Twitter a lot are the biggest ones that we just like put up really big right here, and like people people really want to use them. So like again V3 is super super huge. Um, this is what people really um are just like like this is like first grab, like I want to use an Image generation model. We have Image in 4 from from Google. Um, or Image editing, we have flux context is another big one. Um, next we have the official models. These are always on models or warm models, which basically means we keep the GPU associated with each of these models on at all times, which means for you that you're going to get super super fast results, which is what users likes to to see, obviously. So we have our OpenAI's, we have cling for video, we have uh, Bite Dance's new video model, which a lot of people are talking about. Chatterbox is a good text-to-speech model that a lot of people are starting to use. Anthropic, you can totally just like browse all the official models that we have, and we have them a bunch right here that you can just sort of pick and test. And then what I would say is best for intros, like get just getting started. Uh, you wouldn't know what the names of these models are, but you come into the platform knowing what your use case is. So like generate images, generate video, edit images, upscale images. We've curated all of these APIs here just for your particular use case. Um, use LLM, like we have OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, uh, generate speech, transcribe speech. You can even caption videos. So I know a lot of people have started to use this for like Tik Tok short form content. We have video captioning here. So you can just come in and like, you know, let's say you want to edit images. Just click one of these collections. We have like our recommendations here. So we have like a little blurb about what you can sort of do. So you can change the style of your images. You can add text, keep specific parts of an image while keeping it structure. And then we, you know, sort of go through our recommendations. And then here we have all of the models that we suggest you might want to use. Like these are our top three. So we have the flux context pro and max, and then we have idoggram, and then we have just like a bunch of like upscalers. We even have OpenAI's GPT Image model that went super viral. Um, flux all Yeah, that was the the studio gibli one that was super viral. Yeah, you can use this for studio gibli. Um, you can even use flux contacts for studio gibli at a much cheaper price. Yeah. What do you what do you see between um the GPT Image and flux context? I think a lot of my friends who are interested in the space are very focused on those two models, like because I know the GBT one is a decently more expensive, right? Yeah, it is more expensive, and this uh GPT Image model is what's known as an auto auto regressive model. Um, so it's basically it's different in how it's generating the image itself. So it's going to generate it from top down, whereas a diffusion a diffusion model, which is what flux context is, is going to sort of create it all around. So it's it's different technically, um, like architecturally wise, but they're still both really good models. This one's a little bit more pricey, but you can do multi-image input. So you can see for instance, I said add a floral pattern to the vase, and you can see like her different images are this vase and then this pattern, and then it just puts it on on there, right, for you, and that that itself is an app idea. You can just take this API and have people put two images, merge them together, and that's something that people would pay for. You can go back up to flux context. Um, so these are the big Image editing models that are going super super viral. You can see a lot of people are starting to use these. The difference between these two is is price and um efficiency and like sort of output as well. So pro is the the chiller, more distilled version of max. Max is going to cost you 8, um, so 8 cents per output image, but you can get really great outputs like this style transfer. It preserves text. It adds text to images. And then Pro is going to cost you four cents per image. And it's still a great, great model. You can see that this is really good at style transfer. Make this into a '90s cartoon is the example right here. Um, but people are creating amazing apps just from these two APIs. Flex Context Pro and Flex Context Max. Um, Image editing, thumbnail creation for YouTube, real time voice editing. There's just so much possibility here. Yeah, I think I think it's starting to go more mainstream a little bit. Like Mr. Beast just released a tool that I I'm pretty sure it's just using Flux uh context, but to all of his viewers, right, who might not be AI inclined, just see like, oh, this guy's selling magic. Like, I don't have to generate thumbnails anymore. That's awesome. Um, we might we might have a connection there on the download potentially. I um I could have guessed that. I think that's really cool. I think just with AI images and AI video over the last, I would say three months, like since the OpenAI Image model, we've seen just this rapid acceleration, like uh Google showing all their cards with I think their Image models and obviously their video models are really good, and we haven't even seen what Sora does now, which I never count out OpenAI, so who knows what that'll look like 3 months from now. So, like I'm just saying right now, if you can get some sort of marketing advantage and you are\n\n\nMaking content in some niche, I think there's never been a better time to kind of like dive in and try and create tools because as the technology gets better, your tool will get better.\nSo, you should just focus on marketing and then just constantly be testing the APIs and plug those into your app.\nAnd like I think that is kind of the big recipe that I've seen work across social media, especially as a creator.\nI know a lot of creators who are working on tools like this and I just think you don't it doesn't need to be perfect.\nJust get started and kind of make improvements as AI gets better.\nYeah, totally.\nI mean like all the AI is there.\nLike Replicate is an AI marketplace.\nYou can just take one of these APIs, put it in your app, and then at that point it's just the distribution and the marketing.\nIf you have an advantage there or if you're able to, you know, storytell or, you know, create great content, that will be the advantage in the next coming years for sure.\nOh yeah, totally 100% agree.\nUm yeah, and I think I'll link everything down below.\nLike I'll link a link to some other resources to learn Replicate.\nI'll also link just kind of a link to the Playground and other tutorials that might be helpful.\nI really appreciate you coming on and talk today.\nI learned a lot.\nI took so many notes and I'm actually going to try and recreate the voice app that you created.\nI think that sounds really fun.\nIt is open source also.\nSo if you want to, I will send you I'll send you that link, put it in the description.\nIf you guys who are out there, you know, you want to riff off of it.\nWe love to see what People create.\nAmazing.\nI will do that actually.\nThat sounds really fun.\nAll I need is like an OpenAI key and a Replicate key probably, right?\nAmazing.\nGreat.\nI'm going to do that.\nAwesome.\nNice.\nAll right.\nWell, thank you so much for coming on.\nAwesome.\nThank you so much.\nThanks for having me.\nLove being here.\n",
