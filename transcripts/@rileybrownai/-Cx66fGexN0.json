  "cleanText": "So, if you watch my channel, you know that I normally talk about vibecoding and other AI topics. But today, I'm going to talk about two other Vibe subjects. One being Vibe Studio and the other being AIediting. So, in about a week, we're going to be done building the Vibe Studio. And this will be a full production studio in my new startup in San Francisco with my two co-founders. We are building a full production studio with three cinematic cameras that is going to be fully powered by AI agent. All of the post-production or at least as much of the post-production that we can solve for will be done by AI agents. And I'm so excited about this. And so what will this look like? So this will be three cameras hooked up to a central computer and everything that we film will be sent to the cloud and that's when the AI agents will begin working. And so this will be AI workflows that will automatically be triggered as soon as all of the footage is sent to the cloud. And so we're building this custom software with a startup that is building tools for Vibe creators or Vibe editors. And this setup is going to allow us to create so much more content, so much more educational, high-quality content. And we can focus most of our stuff on pre-production. And in a world of AI where things are moving incredibly fast, when you're making content that helps people, most of the work is actually done in the pre-production. And the part of the pre-production is in the ideation and the actual learning of the topics, right? You want to really dig deep and learn about certain topics. And that's where I want to spend most of my time. I want to spend most of my time creating a marketing team because we now have money. We raised some money to create a vibecoding tool. But we have a marketing team. And this marketing team is going to be fully managed by AI or at least we're going to use AI everywhere we can. And so every employee that we bring on, we are going to be 10xing the amount of AI agents that we use. That's the core mission of the Vibe Studio is to create a ton of content. So the first part is kind of this automated workflow and the second part is what I've been talking a lot about on Twitter/X, which is Vibe editing. And so Vibe editing, the first vibe editing tool that was released has been Descript. And just like Cursor, which has all of your code files on the left and it has, you know, the active code file in the middle and then an AI agent on the right, Descript is very similar except it has the transcript on the left, the video that you're editing on the in the middle and then an AI agent on the right. And for example, I could say, \"Please make this shorter, edit out the parts that are not necessary, add subtitles, and do anything else you think is cool.\" And so we just we're going to run this prompt. Now, it's going to actually plan this out and immediately get started. And just like Cursor or lovable, replet, vibecode app, any of these other tools, you have an AI agent that goes to town to create everything. And here it says editing 1 to 13 chunks. And we have these AI thinking models going through your transcript. Let's create a tic-tac-toe game, but let's use the new GPT4 image model. And we'll make it sharks verse elephants. Have the AI model generate images for the And look at it. It's doing everything. And so it edited script. Now it's determining the best layout for five scenes. Now it's creating additional scenes. So it's basically dividing it into chapters. Here you can see that it's actually adding these little title screens. So icon studio demo. You can see here that it is doing elephant verse shark game. Here we can see that it is doing selfie analyzer app. This is very cool. And so we are going to be using tools like this. So, we're going to have an automated workflow to get everything organized and into a video timeline. And then we're going to use video vibe editing tools like this to use AI agents to edit all of our videos. And our studio is actually going to look a lot like this in this video. We're going to have a really nice studio. We're going to create a replica of this studio that we went to in San Francisco. And I could not be more excited. And so, that is a really cool process. And so obviously we've talked about the automated workflow part and then the vibe editing part. But that also leaves two things which is AI video generation. And if you've been following the Google announcements recently, the AI video generation just hit a major leap forward. It now generates videos with sound natively, which is insane. But I'm going to get to that in a second. Right? That is kind of this post-production that will be deeply embedded into the vibe editing, right? With the Descript AI agent, you're going to be able to say like generate B-roll for this section right here and highlight it and it will generate B-roll for that section. It's going to be really cool. And let's touch on that in a second. I'll talk a little bit more about that. But before you even get to that point, you need to come up with really good video ideas. So, this is actually where I've been spending most of my time recently. Kane Callaway is a creator who's a really good friend of mine and we talk a lot about packaging and creating content on short form, long form. And so I think one of the best places to find really good video ideas is Spotter Studio. And Spotter Studio allows me to be much more creative when creating content scripts. And Spotter Studio also allows me to find outlier videos. Let me show you what I mean. So if I go to this outliers tab right here, I can click on this. And here we can see other creators that are in my niche and I can see their outlier videos. When you're coming up with YouTube video ideas, you need to make sure that people want to click on those videos. And looking at the raw numbers is just not enough. You need to choose videos that are performing better than anyone's average videos. And so this one is performing 5.3 times better than their average video. And so this is how to humanize chat GPT content 1% human to 99% human. And this tells me that I could create a video similar to this and I might get somewhere close to that 5.3x video. Now if I have more subscribers than them, and I do. I have about three times more subscribers than them. I might actually get three times more views if I create a video that's as good or even better. I could get better than their 5.3x multiplier. If you want to find really good ones, you can set the minimum multiplier to like let's say 15. And now we're going to see videos that only do 15 times better than their average video. Take a look at this. This is a really interesting thumbnail idea, which is deepseek will retire you. So instead of just putting like chat GBT created this in 5 minutes, you could say, you know, Cursor will retire you or Claude 4 will retire you and then you show the paid Stripe link down below. And I mean that is really interesting. If I go to the calendar, let me show you this. So I can hit this plus sign right here and we can actually create a video and it will help us come up with our ideas, our outlines and help us organize our thoughts to create a high-quality video. So here we can go through all the stages of ideation. So I can save titles. We can save some of these titles right here. We can go on to thumbnails. And here it will actually use AI to generate some thumbnails. And in the package tab, it really shows us what the video will look like in the feed. Click the link in the description for a free trial. And so that's the pre-production, but if you've been following what Google has been releasing, look at the level of quality AI can create videos at. I mean, look at that. May I remind you that in 2023, just two years ago, this is what it looked like. Smith eating spaghetti made. Look at that. That is what it looked like 2 years ago. And everyone in the comments were like, \"Oh my god, it looks so bad. It's never going to get anywhere.\" And still to this day, people are saying, \"No, it looks lifeless. The goalposts have moved.\" And now AI can literally generate with sound. It can literally sing and it's not great, you know, it's okay. It's fine. But like, imagine this in your AI agent workflow. Imagine as I'm speaking in this video, if I'm editing this video with an AI agent, I can generate any cutaway scene to an AI saying whatever it is that I want or any visual that I want as I'm speaking. AI agents in a workflow that looks a lot like Descript. I'll be able to go here and say generate a video for the intro scene that does X, Y or Z. And it will add it in the exact part that the AI and will analyze the part of the transcript and think to itself, okay, what prompt do I need to send a VO to make it look really good? And it will place that video there. That is what it will look like. And so that is where the future is going. And that is all of this is technology that we're going to be using on a daily basis. And so as I learn more things in my company, as we learn how to build out the Vibe Studio, right, from pre-production to production to post-production and all of the vibe editing that comes after distribution and using AI to cut everything and post it on a ton of different social media platforms, I will be talking about that in great detail. I'm going to talk about it a lot. And so that's just one of my biggest passions. And so I hope you follow along. I'm going to document and start creating more vlog style videos of my company. That is what we're working on. It's really exciting. We're going to build the Vibe Studio and I'll see you here for the next\n",
