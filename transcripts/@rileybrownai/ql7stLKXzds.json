  "cleanText": "I am here with Yoni Smoljar, who has built an app that went viral. It was number one on Product Hunt, and I think you would attribute this to posting every single day for a year on Instagram and then releasing a product. So, can you please tell me about the process of creating content for a full year and then kind of why you decided to make an app after you'd been making content for that long?\n\nDefinitely. By the way, thanks for having me on. Um, I started posting content a year ago on social media. I started with Instagram short-form video that I posted onto TikTok and YouTube shorts as well. The thesis was that it would only serve to my benefit if I had some kind of social media following if I wanted to be successful in online business space. Definitely heavily inspired by Peter Levelvels on Twitter, who, you know, has a huge following online and uses it to distribute his portfolio of bootstrap products. So, I started with like not much of a plan of what I was going to be posting or who am I talking to or what am I talking about, but the discomfort of posting videos was something that I wanted to overcome. So, I just picked up my phone in Instagram, no edits, click record and said, \"Today's day one of doing nothing for every follower I gain. Follow me to find out.\" Totally nonsense. But I posted my first video. Then I posted some more nonsense the next day. Slowly over time, I kind of got my stride. I tried different types of content. I'm a lifelong entrepreneur. Various amounts of success and failure in my businesses, but every time that a business would kind of peter out, I would have to start over from scratch. And nobody knew who I was, the guy who was constantly scrappy, trying, and failing. So, I thought if people knew who I was, maybe it could help my businesses in the long term. And throughout the year, I've had different business ventures that I've attempted with various degrees of success.\n\nI ultimately came up with the idea for Brain Rot, my latest app, which had an explosive success thanks to the following that I had managed to accrue throughout the year. Was the biggest post or like the most impactful post to grow Brain Rot the one on Instagram where you said comment something to get a link where you DM'd them automatically? I'm assuming you use like ManyHat for that.\n\nYeah, I used Manyhat for that. That was probably the single most impactful post, but I spent 2 months in the trenches building the app when I didn't really want to share what it was that I was building. Maybe not a great tactic, but simple enough concept, Brain Rot. So, I thought I want to be the first person to put this out. I sort of built it in silence yet sharing that I was having different obstacles I was running into. Apple rejected the submission like seven times. So, I shared that process. So, I kind of built up this tension over a couple of months as I was building this thing. Um, and so I think that that definitely helped.\n\nYeah. I think going back to posting every day on Instagram, it's very interesting. I'm sure the first time you went viral, like it you have you feel it in your body. It's exciting, right? When you show up to the app and it shows 999,999 and you're like you have your notifications maxed out. They don't go any higher. And there's a reason for that, right? It literally teaches you how to make content because it reinforces that if you want to get really good at making content, the best way to do it is to just start and then learn through this process of like seeing something not work, seeing something not work. If you do a month of making decent videos, people will see it. You will go viral, right? If the content is actually interesting and valuable to someone, it will go viral. And you just basically need to take enough shots on these algorithms for it to happen once and then you just learn from there. And you kind of ride the waves.\n\nYeah, I definitely agree. I started out with in my bio, I had 1% better every day because I think this is kind of what it takes. You start out um you're going to get 200 views on your video, right? Or 100 views. And that might happen for the first 10, 20, 50, 100 videos. Like Mr. Beast, I think famously it took him whatever many years, many, many, many videos before anything happened. So, I think I would caution or I would at least prep anybody who's thinking about content or just starting out in content. Like, it very well may take longer than you'd like for things to start working. Be prepared that it'll take a 100 videos. I think Mr. Beast famously said, you know, come back after you've posted 100 videos and we'll talk. So, like it really does take that amount of time. Constantly iterate. If things aren't working, change something. Don't post the same video 100 times expecting something's going to happen. You're not going to get rewarded just for showing up. You're going to get rewarded for showing up and improving. So yeah, I mean, and to your point, like these platforms are addicting. They reward you with dopamine and likes and comments and follows. Try not to get too sucked into these metrics because they can make the whole thing a bit devoid of meaning. Now, you're not posting the things that you want to post. You're not posting things you're interested in. You're just like kind of guessing what the mob wants, which is not really a good long-term strategy. But yeah, definitely uh use the feedback loops for what they are. The algorithm might not tell you how it's written, but it tells you what's good and what's bad. I 100% agree. Just planting a flag in the ground and saying like this is the content that we're going to do. We're not going to deviate from content around this because these are our morals. We're going to create very high quality content and we're going to make it very valuable and we know it's valuable because what we're talking about is inherently valuable if you were just talking to someone on the street versus whatever is working in the moment. You know, like last month it's it was The month before that it's some other niche strategy. It was posting these like still TikToks that are 5 seconds that just have a little caption and then you end up with thousands of people with millions of AI agents assembling these videos and slopping them on the internet. When I hear the term growth hack, I've now conditioned to think basically just like optimized low quality for the moment. But that when it is low quality, it's easy to reproduce. And so I think I'm really glad you said that because the most sustainable long-term strategy is providing value. And the best way to provide value is not only teaching people how to do things, but to kind of make sure that it is a cohesive story. And this brings up your point about how you've been in a lot of entrepreneurial endeavors and when you would do one and then one would fail, you have to completely start over. But if you build a personal brand and like root it in your actual values, so you're not like lying. you're you are yourself, then you basically are just taking a lifelong bet on yourself. And people say like, \"Oh, I don't really want to be a content creator.\" And it's just like, \"Are you a resume creator?\" And they're like, \"What?\" And I'm like, \"Do you create résumés when you want a job?\" And they're like, \"Well, yeah, you have to.\" And like, I would argue that it is more important now to create content than to create résumés. I'm sure you can attest to this. There's no amount of résumés you could write for the rest of your life that would be more valuable than creating the content that you've created. you have infinite more connections and that's you your own person. So any business that you might want to start in the future or any job you might want to get in the future, you are increasingly well positioned to get it.\n\nI think you're I think you're totally right. And I would also add that it can't be understated the value of the trust and credibility that gets built by, you know, being somebody on the other side of the screen of people's phones. A lot of people don't want to be a content creator and it's a lifestyle choice and I totally get it. Obviously, we can't have 8 billion content creators or certainly can't expect it. But we have 8 billion content consumers and nobody thinks twice. I can speak personally through creating content. I've got to meet on, you know, personal levels people who used to be idols to me or people who I used to look up to that you see them on the phone when you're scrolling and you kind of have some sense of who they are. You've maybe listened to them for many minutes or many hours. you have some sense of what their beliefs are. You feel like you know them. Now that I'm a content creator, I'm sort of in the arena. These people have become my friends. So like the doors it opens to you can't be understated 100%. If you can build a product and then make content or tell interesting stories about your life and how you make that product, you are a digital assassin. That is what people should be learning right now. And creating content should almost be a foundation.\n\nOne thing I wanted to dive into is the Brain Rot app. And so cool. I guess at what point in your content journey did you come up with the idea for Brain Rot and just talk about that idea a little bit first because I think it's brilliant.\n\nCool. So I'll tell you where it came from. I had as I spoke to earlier an e-commerce business that ended and I had this moment of contemp where I didn't know what's next but I had the eyes of like hundreds of thousands or millions of people upon me. And so I I felt like I wanted to do something meaningful. I've always been a scrappy entrepreneur and I've always done kind of like whatever's the shiny object. So I took a couple months and I just thought and you know not like deep think but I just observed my life to see what problems I have because a lot of times this is sort of a valuable thing to index on is like solve a problem for yourself. Not always, but a lot of times. And having at that point posted content for many, many months and being sucked into this social media vortex of likes, comments, and follows and notifications. I was just spending so much time on my phone and I just felt like this dependence on my phone. I was constantly checking these apps, checking notifications. I wasn't present. I felt like cognitive decline. I had short-term memory. I was just like so deeply in my phone. And these apps exist for like screen time apps, but I had this idea of like, you know, this is clearly brain rot. I feel that my brain is rotting. I would love a cute little brain avatar that would rot. And it's a simple enough app. And I made a video that said, uh, yesterday I had the realization that I have a problem in my life that a very simple app could fix. So I sat down and started brainstorming the feasibility of that app. And it turns out, you know, it's a fairly simple app. Thankfully, I'm a software engineer. So maybe what's fairly simple to me is not fairly simple to everyone. But in the world of vibe coding, this is increasingly becoming the case that to build a mobile app is becoming fairly simple. And so I just started building and I built and I rebuilt it a few times. I had some isolated user feedback of people close to me that I ran ideas and wireframes off of, but almost all the code, 90 plus% vibe coded. All the digital assets, all the images, animations, the wireframes, all the design was all AI. So that that was kind of the start.\n\nYeah, that is really interesting. So like you didn't hire any designer to make your app. Let's take five minutes here. I'm going to share my screen with AI. like you can create content in the form of software because what you just described is like you wish you had this little brain rot thing and you could have made a video talking about how as you spend more time on your phone your brain deteriorates but you decided to turn it into software and it's a pretty hard app to uh to vibe code. I'm assuming you dealt with a lot of problems with the internal uh Apple APIs that you needed access to. Um and I'm sure that like that's probably going to be your toughest problem going forward is just kind of like managing that. Did you have GPT40 image model? Is that what you used for this?\n\nYeah, GPT40 image model is how I made the assets and it's also how I made the wireframes. So, you can vibe code and say build me an app that does XYZ and you'll get Claude or whatever LLM to write code that will lay it out in some way. Or you can just ask a chat 40 image generator to generate you an iPhone mockup of this app that you describe. And the images of mock-ups are usually much better than the code-generated mock-ups as far as design goes. And then you can take this image and put it right into your whatever vibe code of choice and have it Yeah. See, there you go. Cute little brain. You can create a cute little brain. So you have like the brain when it's healthy and then you have a brain. I'm assuming it it just switches the image once it hits 90% or something like that or something.\n\nYeah. And then so you created like five little brains. All right. So now make him a 10% more thick. And so this is just like a little example, but like something as simple as representing screen time in the form of a cute character can be something that goes super viral because it wasn't just your post. Not only does your post need to go viral, but the quality of the app is going to determine how viral the video goes. You took a term that was brain rot, which is a very common thing to talk about. There's been apps, other apps created called like PDF to brain rot. when people don't want to read a full PDF. Instead, it'll turn it into one of those Minecraft things, right? And um it'll create brain rot, but in your case, you're preventing brain rot by showing you're kind of the brain rotting. And you went through this process of creating these diagrams and then you basically imported them into any app. This right here, I think, is Oh, he's sad. He's sad. But uh yeah, anyway, I just wanted to show people that this is that easy. And you could go to uh apps like Vzero, Vibe Code, and you can just say like create an app and use these images and you can upload all of them. Like you could probably create like most of the designs.\n\n\nYou could just say, \"Create an iPhone mockup.\" Exactly.\n\nYep. With this as the logo, it's called Brain Rod, and it is like a dashboard of, you know, screen time top and center. The app is a dashboard of screen time. It is called Brain Rot. Yeah. And then it'll just create a little mockup. And then you can copy and paste this mockup. And if you uploaded multiple images, you could say, \"Please create the mockup that looks like the first image and use the second image as the logo.\" And it will literally just use the PNG.\n\nSo, I have a lot of exposure to what is the public sentiment around AI code generation, using AI to build apps and businesses. And I think that there is still this perception that AI is slop, that like people will refer to anything AI generated as slop, as some kind of like slur, that like, you know, they don't like AI. There's this like pretty broad anti-AI sentiment. See, there you go. I mean, look at the... Yeah, it's great. So, you know, haters will call this AI slop. I would encourage those haters to use the tools more. If that was not a good mockup, ask for another mockup. Open a new window and ask for another mockup. Come back tomorrow and ask for another mockup. Like, I built this app. It's not going to build me an app, and it's going to be a working production-ready code. But if you're persistent, built this app probably as an amalgamation of like 500 to a thousand prompts, right? So, just like keep prompting, keep iterating. If you're persistent using these tools, like you can really have outsized returns, 100%. And I, a lot of the people who talk about AI slop and who talk about how vibe coding, it's all swap, it's going to be terrible. If you think about the beginning of content creation, or it wasn't even called content creation, you needed to have a big clunky camera and like you actually had to know how cameras worked, more so, like if you think about the 1990s, to have a video camera and then also be able to edit that video is like, how do you even do that, right? It's without a very specific niche expertise, right? Same with software engineering in 2020. It is a skill that you need to develop. But if you go back to content creation, turns out that these devices that we all have, we had Canva, we have CapCut. Now we have tools that make everything more simplified. And if you go to a lot of the people who make content all the time on their phone, who are also calling vibe coding slop, and you ask them how their camera works, they won't know because technology has made it easier to understand. And then you're, and then you ask them like, \"Oh, how do you change the color of the c of the shot when you film?\" And they're like, \"Oh, I apply a filter.\" And it's like, what does that mean? Like, there's something really complex going on there, and you don't even know what it is. So if you're using a filter, is that just slop? That is kind of some of the arguments. So like technology has made it so easy for anyone like you and me, right? We have significantly changed the trajectory and quality of our lives through creating content on technology. We don't understand. I don't want to speak for you, but I don't understand how cameras work. I understand how to edit videos, but I don't know like what's happening under the hood. I don't even know what under the hood would look like. And my point is like, that's just how humans use tools in a society. We make tools and we use them, and you can use them to express yourself. So yes, you used AI to make the Brain Rot app, but you iterated over and over and over again until the end experience to the user was something that could go viral, that it's fun, it was very cute characters. I thought it was really good. It was way better than the one we just created on the computer because you went through those iterations. And so this is a long-winded way to say, maybe don't be cynical to anyone listening to this. Maybe try not being cynical and like thinking about things in a positive light, and it may completely change the trajectory of your life. Just maybe completely agree. I think all the benefits belong to techno-optimists, and then all of the, I don't know, maybe noise and complaints, it's all technopesimism. Like this is happening whether you like it or not. You can complain and moan and hate on the internet, or you can lean in and ask how you can use this to your advantage.\n\nYeah. And I've never claimed that this technology is great for society. I just know that it doesn't matter. And a lot of people who are in my shoes will say that it is great for society. AI is great for the world, or the internet's great for the world. I don't know if it's a net positive, but like you're not going to stop it. And I think if there's one thing that I'm really sad about our generation, like I'm on the edge of Gen Z in terms of age, like if there's one thing I could change about this cohort of people near my age, it would be to be less cynical and try to use the technology, anything that you're cynical about, like just for a month. You don't even have to tell anyone about it. Just test it and see that if you understand the benefits of the technology, can it improve your life in such a way that it would improve the lives of people around you? Because it's likely that it would. I'm able now to hire people, like give people careers because of learning content creation and learning how to use AI. You're in a position... I've been seeing people on social media left and right saying, \"Yoni has inspired me to create content. Yoni has...\" and and that's one thing I wanted to get before the end of this. You have actually inspired me. Like, you have made me realize that I have become a static character on Instagram and Tik Tok. Like, I've become the Kevin Malone, but I make content on AI. And I'm realizing now that I need to start making content. The video I posted last night, I was like, you know what, it... I'm going to make this video about being in an abandoned barn because I think what I'm doing right now is really interesting, but I've trained myself to be in the algorithmic bucket that Instagram and Tik Tok put me in, which is this guy who talks about AI. Guess what? AI is going to replace that. So I think one of the realizations, it's kind of along the themes of like elite media, but like it's becoming a dynamic character. AI is really cool, and it can offer a lot of opportunities, but it is coming for the static characters on social media. So that's just one other thing that I've noticed. Yeah, you've really inspired me, and I hope that people, like I hope I can inspire people to do the same and and actually use this technology to better their lives because I've seen how much better your life can get when you use technology and you get rid of the cynicism. Thanks.\n\nYeah. Well, I definitely appreciate that. I'll say, uh, I think that you are doing something a little more interesting than posting videos every single day. My current, uh, the thing I'm doing... You have a company to build, and I think that I think the vibe coding is going to have like really outsized impact on people. I'm not sure it's more interesting. It's however you tell the story. I think you're doing a better job of telling your story than I am mine. And I think that telling a story is like critical to the success of anything. And I think that is kind of the beautiful thing about this period of time is like you don't need an insane story. Like to anyone listening, like you don't need to be... you... I think people can really get... people want relatability, and that's one thing that I'm learning more, um, about content is like people are just starving for hum... like a human to relate to who can also provide advice, someone who's like right ahead of them. This is such a big reason why a lot of the grifting course guru types win because they understand the fact that like they buy a penthouse in Miami and they take a video where everything is interesting behind them, and they capture the minds of 17 to 20-year-old males who like want to live that life. And I think it's important for people who like are doing actual cool things to tell their story to kind of counteract that, or else you're just leaving it to the people whose job it is or who've created careers around around that. And so like I think if you're a startup founder or you're in the business space and maybe you spend time on X or LinkedIn, I would highly encourage you if you can to shift over to X or to Instagram and Tik Tok because not many businesses and successful people are... I think it is a such a vector for people who are actually like doing interesting things and can provide value.\n\nI completely agree. I think specifically in our space of AI and technology that X is like a hive mind or X, you know, this is a bubble where everybody is in the loop on all of the latest, greatest, what model drop today. This is upstream of the rest of the internet who has no idea what are these conversations or what we're talking about. So like there's a massive arbitrage. If you want to do like a media company where you just tell Instagram what's going on on Twitter, huge opportunity there. Or if you're just an entrepreneur and maybe it's not working out yet. Maybe you're an entrepreneur who hasn't had his first big win yet. Maybe things are starting to fall into place. Maybe they aren't yet. I think you can follow my playbook. Just tell the story of what happened today or what you're thinking about tomorrow. Doesn't need to be highly edited. 99% of my videos are not scripted. I just sit in front of the camera and I talk for a few minutes and then I cut it down into 60 seconds and post it. So, you know, I think, uh, to your point about relatability, like this is something that a lot of people are craving online.\n\nDo you write your scripts first, or do you... you just... you just... you don't even have an outline? You just sit... Oh, wow. Okay. Like sometimes I don't even know what I'm about to... what's going to happen when I open my mouth. Really? Wow. I will say that surprises me just because it feels like your videos are like structured in a way that they're very coherent. I always thought like you maybe take 30 minutes to just write out a general outline or script and you sit down and read it. That surprises me. Yeah. So I'll take like 5 to 8 minutes to just talk into the camera, and I'll even sometimes repeat the same sentence over and over again until it sounds good in my head, and then I just cut it down and, uh, post 60 seconds, 90 seconds, whatever it is. That's amazing. I'd always been like fully scripted or fully unscripted, but when I go fully unscripted, my brain, my ADHD brain will go into many different directions, and it's not like it's not a straight through line through the video.\n\nWhat's next for you? You've been posting consistently. You've kind of captured a lot of the attention on Instagram. It seems like Tik Tok might be lagging behind. How is Tik Tok going?\n\nI don't know. It just never took off. I think different people have different... I have some theories as to... I'm wondering if on Tik Tok, hear me out here. I want you to maybe try this for a week. Post it without the music. I have a theory that it will work better. That's one thing that I did. I was AV testing a year ago on Instagram and Tik Tok. And whenever Instagram did a lot better than Tik Tok, and I removed the music in the background, the video started to do better because I think they want you, if you use music, to use their trending sounds, and they don't want you to use copyrighted music in your thing. I just want... I'm very curious about that AV test.\n\nThat's a good theory. I'll definitely try that.\n\nYeah. So anyway, you're on Instagram, you're on TikTok, you've grown Brain Rot. How is Brain Rot doing? Do you feel like this is something that like you want to like... this is going to be your main focus for a while?\n\nI think so. Yeah, I think so. It's going really well. It had like truly an explosive launch, and I think it just has such potential, and it's exciting and interesting to me to have it realize that potential. So like, you know, I spent all last night and this morning building this little widget into the home screen. So it's like go, you know, that's fun to me. It's fun, and so it's worth putting time into. So that's what I'm doing now. I think it has huge potential.\n\nI do too. And it has a massive market. Anyone can relate to it.\n\nDoes totally. It has a massive market. So now it's kind of time for phase two of the business, which is just growth and impressions. Um, so, so do you have any plans for that? Like, um, or are you going to try and stay focused on what's working? Because that's usually the best option when you're growing fast already is just to not get distracted and just keep going because what you what you're doing seems to be working.\n\nTotally. I will say like I don't want to market this app to my followers. So I mean, those who are interested in the story and want to support me, it's amazing. I don't want to become a salesman in my videos. People who, you know, are following to see the journey of an aspiring entrepreneur, which is, you know, like the just true story of my life. I don't want it to kind of flip where I'm like, you know, download my app, download my app. I'd much rather show them what it is to market an app on social media and just show that story and let people continue to learn from the successes and failures. So, I think... I think that's a really good way. I mean, I know Alex Hormozi talks about that, how he actually never promotes his products on his page, but he does run paid ads to his following, um, and kind of builds up that goodwill and then, uh, runs ads, but his ads are usually to some like pretty expensive event, like $50,000 a ticket or whatever.\n\nYeah. Yeah. $50,000 a ticket. So it may make sense there where an app like your app's pretty cheap, and so it might not make sense to run to run paid ads. Um, but like, yeah, I mean, there's so much you can learn, and that's so much fun. Um, because like basically now, like all you have to do is learn how to become a successful marketer and then teach other people how to do it, and that is like a fun life to live.\n\nI... I will say like you're just teaching people how you became successful, um, and you're not really selling it, but I mean, obviously you're the founder of it, and as you grow, your app will just naturally grow. That's just...\n\n\nHow following works.\nUm, and that's a good thing.\nUm, and so I...\nYeah, I'm...\nThat's awesome, dude.\nI'm really happy for you.\nThanks.\nYeah.\nAnyway, yeah, thanks for coming on the pod.\nMy pleasure.\nThanks for having me, Riley.\nThis was awesome.\n",
