  "cleanText": "As we all know, about a month ago, Google VEO mic drop. It generates videos not only with sound effects but with perfect audio. It's insane. In this episode, I sat down with two of the biggest experts in AI video, Bilawal Sidhu and Matt Wolfe. I got an early preview of Google VEO 3 before I was even allowed to talk about it, and it absolutely blew my mind. I think we're going to get cinematic movies by the end of maybe like next year. We talked about Google's new Google VEO 3 model that is taking the world by storm, how creators are using Flow and Luma Labs to generate cinematic scenes, and why editing with AI might be the most underrated superpower right now. A lot of people think that this is a huge threat to video producers. I think it is going to be a golden era. You go back to being the creative director, the conductor of the orchestra. That's what I think is going to blow our minds. We also dug into vibe, coding, and 3D video and what it means to create in a world where real and synthetic are starting to blur. I still think that people are really, really going to value when humans do cool [ __ ] in a world where increasingly we can't tell the difference between real and fake anymore. I think there's going to be two things that are going to be very interesting.\n\nWe're going to talk about the latest and greatest in the world of AI video because I'm not going to lie, six months ago I was a little bit bearish on AI generated video. I'm like, I don't know about the whole diffusion models thing. I was kind of bearish on the fact that you had to generate the videos and get the Audio tracks separately and then stitch them together through some cheesy lip-sync model. And then as we all know, about a month ago, Google VEO drops the most insane. It's it's insane. It's like it's a mic drop. It generates videos with not only with sound effects, but with perfect audio, not not maybe not perfect audio, but high quality audio. And it perfectly matches with the uh movement of the mouth, which is what I thought was the biggest barrier. I was like, you know what, I think we got a year and a half. I no longer think that. I think we're going to get cinematic movies by the end of maybe like next year. People are going to be using 99% uh AI generated video. So, I guess I'll go to you first, Matt. What has surprised you the most about the new Google VEO 3 model? Yeah, it's it's interesting because I did the same thing where like I don't know, maybe 18 months ago I put like a tweet up on well an exp post up where I said like I don't really think that AI video is going to get to the point where people are generating, you know, 30 minute videos that you can't even tell are AI and then like I don't know how much longer after that but call like 3 months later I got an early preview of like Google VEO 3 before I was even allowed to talk about it and I had to go to to X and went Yeah, I was wrong. Like we're we're gonna get there. It's going to happen. I just saw something that blew my mind and I wasn't allowed to talk about it yet. So, it was like a total tease to everybody, but like I saw behind the scenes. It was like holy. And this was V2 at the time. It wasn't even Google VEO 3. And yeah, it just it absolutely blew my mind. Especially, you know, I was making videos 2 and 1/2 years ago about things like model scope and zero scope. But I don't know if you remember those AI video models, but like you could barely even tell what was going on in the video, right? Like I would generate a monkey on roller skates and you'd get like a sort of blurry mess of pixels where if you like squinted real hard, you're like, man, maybe I could see a monkey in that video. Now it's like they're actually generating like anatomically correct monkeys that I had to like censor in my videos. Monkeys are going Monkeys are going viral on Instagram as we speak. I'm going to show a video on the Oh, the Yeti stuff is awesome, too. Yeah, there's literally apes like in the middle of the jungle like cooking stuff, doing uh cooking influencer content, speaking to the camera. So, as we speak, you know, a year ago, you couldn't really make a coherent monkey. Definitely no sound effects. Now, you can do create a monkey influencer in front of a fire. you can get it to say whatever you want it to say and do whatever you want it to do. Just reacting to the video stuff. I think similarly, man, it's like this collapsing of complexity that's happening. That's super nuts. Just like, you know, with like GPT even 40, right? You had to like prompt this thing several times to get to a result and then models like 01 Pro and 03 drop that sort of like, oh, we're just going to have that internal conversation amongst ourselves and give you the answer that you wanted. Like an expert prompter. I kind of think of reasoning models as like an expert back back and forth forth prompter kind of collapsing all that complexity down. Same thing happening with video. Kind of what you said earlier, Riley. Like you had to duct tape a bunch of these tools together in this cluji way. And so this is the perfect example to make something like this that's funny. It was next to impossible. Like yeah, you could use like whatever video model of choice. Then you'd maybe toss it into something like Runway to kind of retarget and reanimate the lips. Maybe the voice is coming from ElevenLabs and sort of kind of monotone and you can't really like you know make it sound genuine or like authentic. Now I just give a highle prompt to something like Google VEO 3 especially inside of a tool like Flow and it does everything else for you and like you said gives you Audio and Video out. My takeaway is that like this stuff feels like a generative Camera and you're like prompting people on a sound stage to do stuff versus, oh, I'm going to make my video, then I'm going to make my audio, then I'm going to combine those things together, then I'm going to do that any number of times. So, it's like just a drastic like speeding up of like making generative creation capabilities accessible to people without needing to know how to duct tape a bunch of crap together. 100%. And so, first of all, this first frame here, this part is AI generated. Like, this is Google VEO 3 right here. All of it's Google VEO 3. All of this is Google VEO 3. Like, it's actually crazy. Like, look at the dirt. Like, the dirt is flying up. Like, the physics are solid. And then I love the cutaway. Just the cutaway to the sky talking about it. It's It's amazing.\n\nOkay, so this is on a new platform. It's called Flow by Google. And so this is a platform you go to and it just looks like any other um kind of video or image generation tool and you can just generate videos. My question for you guys, like what do you think is next in this platform? Like in my opinion, it has high quality video generation already and you can what I think it needs is character consistency and then like being able to like add in the next scene. Like what do you think? What do you because it feels like Google's trying to make a play at create at making this tool that kind of has everything you need built into it. I'm wondering, Matt, I I'll ask you like what do you think this will look like 6 months from now? Like what features do you think Google wants to add to this platform? Yeah, it's almost like they want this like CapCut kind of thing, but also with like generative AI built right into it so you can generate all the scenes instead of having to pull them all in. Now, with with Flow, I really like where they're going with Flow, but if I'm being totally honest about it, it still needs a lot of work. So, if we're looking at like where I see it in the future, I mean, I I don't know if you guys run into these issues with playing with Flow, but like I can get it to generate audio on like the first 8 seconds, but then when I go to extend the video, it like kills the audio on the second generation. Um, you know, it it's still really really funky when you try to add like an image as like your starting frame. A lot of times it it won't even generate audio most of the time if you use an image as a starting frame. Like the the user interface is still kind of weird. you can hit the plus button on the very right and it'll like generate a frame in between two other frames instead of generating a frame all the way on the right or a new scene all the way on the right. Um, so I I still think Flow has like a lot to be desired. I think it's still kind of buggy, which is the reason why, you know, all of their plans are still discounted right now. I think they sort of know this is like very very beta still. Um, but yeah, I mean I I I think where they want to go with it is that sort of like CapCut style thing, except instead of having to go and record a bunch of videos with your iPhone, go and record a bunch of videos with your Camera, import them in, chop them all up. Every single scene that you're making, you just generate with AI, you rearrange it. Maybe you have a scene where somebody's talking, you'll be able to go in and prompt it and say, you know, give them a more Texas accent or whatever, right? And it'll actually change the way they speak a little bit. Um, you know, I I think that's what they want to go for, but you know, I still struggle to get exactly what I'm looking for out of it. The one thing that I have actually been impressed with is that the character consistency is actually pretty good in my opinion where if you generate like one frame and it's got like two characters in it and then you have it generate another frame or another scene that second scene a lot of times the audio is no longer there for whatever reason it just stops creating the audio but the characters still look like the same people. So I feel like the character consistency is probably the best I've seen out of video generation. It's just there's you know still some issues. I don't know. Bilawal, have you seen like a different experience or what what has your experience with Flow been?\n\nNo, I mean I would plus one what you said. The audio thing is like you can kind of fix it with prompting a little bit. Like you have to explicitly in your prompt say that you want this kind of audio cuz otherwise I agree even for the first generation. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. I know there are like pesky things they're trying to fix. Like I'm sure you got the weird subtitles that keep freaking popping up. The letter boxing keeps popping up. So clearly they know these things. I mean, like my take on it is like the one place where I'd like slightly refine what you said is like the CapCut reference, right? Where it's like it feels to me more like they want you to go edit this in whatever nonlinear editor you use, but they want this to sort of be the conductor of the orchestra to get everything else. So, I almost think of it more like a Camera replacement and a sound stage replacement. Like I'm thinking this is like the equivalent of somebody like I don't know going into like like you're James Cameron and Avatar instead of shooting on a super expensive capture volume you're pulling the [ __ ] out of latent space on your laptop right I think the next step from here is like hey if I'm doing multi-shot generation I just want to be able to say here these are the three characters I have this is what they look like this is what they sound like this is like the sets that I'm shooting in this is the time of day and whether that's it's like appending stuff to the prompt behind the background or doing some sort of multimodal prompting where it's the text and the images too. I think like that's the next step and the extend scene is I think going in this direction. But maybe the second and last thing I'll say is that I'm really excited about is man I want this to like I want them to do something like the videotovideo stuff that Luma Labs just came out with and everyone's going wild over like flux concept as well. And same thing with four row image generation where it's like I have a shot. Here's a prompt or an image reference to change it. But don't take what I said literally. It's more like you're telling a creative director to make a change or make a shot. Yeah. Stuff like this I think would be the perfect addition to it because again I love text prompting when you're fleshing something out but it's so much easier. Maybe pull up some of John Finger stuff if you go to his profile. Can you quickly break down this for all the viewers right now? Like what is what is happening here? What is So, this is Luma Labs. So, Luma Labs made an announcement. Um, and there's all these different examples here. And so, introducing modify video. I I'll let you explain it because you're the you're the VFX king. Sure. I mean, so think of it like what 40 image generation and flux concept lets you do where you have an image and then you use text or image references to define how you want to change it. Think of this exactly like that for video where we've had video to video in the past, right? Like those like anime reskinned videos were so popular, but it was kind of cluji. It like adhered to the structure of the scene too literally. Now it's kind of doing this like semantic interpretation. And what I mean by that is that you got control over the style, character, and setting separately. And you can define all these things. And that what lets you do is almost view it like wireframing with video. You're providing the coarsest grain reference of what you want like the final result to be like you in your backyard swinging stuff around or holy [ __ ] Go to John Finger's profile. I think you'll get a bunch of really funny uh examples there cuz I would say like he's kind of like a J just without the H. So John worked on a bunch of this promo video stuff and he's been doing these kind of workflows forever. But like the idea again being rather than you using text and image references to describe all you want, just use your iPhone and capture roughly like a breakdown of what you're looking for. This example is really crazy. It's actually the bottom that's the input into the model here. So he's puppeteering this thing and then he's provided an image reference of himself so that he's basically using the puppet to puppeteer himself. So that just gives you an idea of like video in, video out. Well, but this like smart model in the\n\n\nMiddle is going to unlock so much.\n\nOh, wait. The puppeteer is the real video, and then the top video is the interpretation of him. Oh, that's so weird that I thought the top video was the input.\n\nExactly. You could see him puppeteering in the back on the bottom left if you see. It's kind of funny. And uh yeah, look at the one, the one below that is a really cool example too, just to crystallize this point. It's like you could have something as simple as a video that you've recorded on the top, and you go into Premiere or After Effects or Cap Cut, and you're like, \"I want like a little freaking, like, you know, uh, gnome walking around the street like this.\" That's like the coarsest grain wireframe or like gray boxed or whatever your term of choice is representation. Toss that into a model, and boom, you've got your gnome walking around. Super photorealistic. The shadows are freaking perfect. Imagine, like, this is where I get blown away, dudes. Like doing this in 3D was like a [ __ ] like days job, and now it's like, \"Oh my god, this is what I want. I tell the model what I want, and boom, there you go.\" It's kind of crazy.\n\nOkay, so going back to what you were just saying about um, so Google Veo or Yeah. Yeah. the Google Flow platform. You were you were suggesting that this would be a good addition to the platform because you can generate with Google Veo, and all of these videos or all what Luma Labs is, Luma Labs has an input video and then like an input prompt or maybe an image prompt. Can you add an image prompt with it? Yeah, you can. Yeah. And so you basically have this base layer of whatever video you create, and then you can just turn it into any style that you want. And or another way is you can actually just go out with any Camera out into the real world, take footage of doing things, and all you have to do is get the rough sketch. Um, and so yeah, this is starting to make sense to me because I haven't really wrapped my head around this. But now anyone can go create some cinematic film, and all they don't even need a nice iPhone. They just need any iPhone, and they just upload it, and they can change it to anything. This is I have not. Have you tried Luma yet? I have yet to try Luma. I've used it. U Yeah, it's cool. I, I, for whatever reason, when when I use it, I've struggled to get some of like the similar results. Obviously, when like companies like Luma post their stuff on social media, it's going to be a little cherry-picked, right? Um, definitely cherry-picked. But, so when I've tried to use it, I've really, really struggled to get like the character consistency. Like I would record videos of myself and then say like, you know, put me in a different shirt. Like they had examples where somebody would like jump, and then every time they jump, their outfit would change, but it still looked like the same person. I was doing tests like that, and I could not get it to make it consistently look like me. Every time I would like change the video or tell it to change the shirt, it would like look like somebody else. I'd be wearing a hat. It would make the hat be gone. It would get rid of the beard. It would just be a completely different person in the video whenever I tried to do that. To be fair, there's probably some like prompting best practices that I'm not aware of to get that kind of result. Um, but in my testing, I really, really struggled to get that kind of thing. Where I found it um useful and helpful was almost kind of doing the same thing that Runway Gen One used to do, where you make a video, and then you'd say like, \"Turn me into a robot\" or something, right? And it was all the exact same motions, but now it was like a robot doing those motions. That kind of stuff was pretty easy to get those kinds of results out of, but to get the character to stay consistent, I really, really struggled to make that work in my tests.\n\nI think this is also where Google VEO 3 is better. Like Matt, like would you agree that like Google VEO 3 has the best sort of hit rate of like you give a prompt, image, text, hybrid, and like the results you you require fewer rerolls to get to something that's usable. 100% 100%.\n\nWhich is great because it is the most expensive AI model I've ever seen, I think. Yeah, it's you get 20,000 credits, and each one is a hundred like each one is a 100 credits. So if you're generating four at a time, I mean, they go quick. It'll go in 10 minutes if you're not careful. And on their lower plan, their $20 a month plan, you get 10 generations total. Like once you've used 10, they're they're done. You're gone. Like they don't reup every month. You get 10 generations for joining that plan. That's funny. That's like so if if they do the stuff that Luma is doing, I think it's going to be so much like it's just like I don't know if it's the data mode or some algorithmic stuff, but yeah, even having myself seen the evolution from like they did a V1 preview last IO, and then they didn't really kind of roll or they kind of rolled it out for a little bit, and then it was straight to V2. That was a holy [ __ ] leap, and then V3 with the Audio is like another like holy [ __ ] leap. And oh my god, man. like Flow is then again like trying to make it easier to prompt these things and make it more accessible. So like it's it's the de facto. I think that that's the current king, and like what's funny is like Sora kind of started all of this, and what the hell happened to Sora? Like does anyone even go to sora.com? I'm not going to lie, I still think they're sitting on something. I feel like they they they feel like they've fallen behind. And so like they it doesn't strike me like Sam understands that if he releases a model that's like not as good as Google, it there's really no point. Like they have such a deep they they've just captured so much of the market on the tech side. I feel like the next time they release it, it's going to be 10 times as good. Um, just based on just how much talent they have at OpenAI, I I'm gonna make the prediction within three to six months they're going to announce something insane. Yeah, I I agree with that. I think I think they have been sitting on a much better version of Sora. I mean, I think the version that anybody has access to now is still not as good as the demos they showed when they sort of sneak peeked Sora like a year ago, right? Like that stuff was really, really good. The the version we got access to was like what was it? Sora Turbo or something like that, which was like a faster sort of um I don't know, quantized model or something. I still don't think we've even seen the model that they were demoing early on, cuz that early model was able to generate they said like up to one two-minute generations, like we haven't gotten that out of any of the AI video models yet.\n\nYeah, I think I think that might just be $200 uh for one generation. That's probably why they haven't got the cost down. So, okay. So, one thing I wanted to talk about, I tweeted about this today. I think the same thing that happened to developers, and it's it's blown my mind working with actual cracked developers who are really talented, use AI for nearly everything. The speed at which they move is insane to watch them navigate their computer, and like there they have multiple AI chat windows. They're asking multiple models about how to solve a problem, and then when they and it's it's kind of really fun to watch. I personally believe the same thing is about to happen with like very high-quality video editors. You know, a lot of people think that, you know, like this is a huge threat to, you know, video producers, video editors. I think it is going to be a golden era if you know how to storytell and use Premiere Pro or use any of the video editing tools. It doesn't matter. I think it is a golden era, and I think it's something that I'm actively hiring at my company because it is so high leverage to just give a video editor access to the tools. They can go out. They don't need to rely on anyone to get the B-roll footage if they're good enough. Um, they can stitch things together in a way that's coherent. And I think all of the really viral videos we've seen across social media, there's a lot of manual work. Maybe all of the frame, like everything was generated by AI, but the stitching them together requires so much more skill, and so I think I think for the next 5 years even, like the or I I don't want to make predictions that deep, but for the next year, the the the return on being able to elevate these outputs, stitch them together, and make them like into very high-quality stories is going to be astronomical. I'm wondering what you guys think about this perspective.\n\nYeah, I mean, I totally agree. I that's sort of always been when it comes to AI, that's sort of been the head space I've been in for forever is like if you're good at something, AI turns you into like a superhuman at that thing. And that goes for coding, that goes for video generation, that goes for art. I just think uh, you know, a lot of creators need to sort of get out of their own way. I think there's a lot of creators that are very, very, very resistant to using it, but usually once they start using it and realize like, \"Oh, this isn't replacing me yet. It actually just makes what I do a lot easier.\" A lot of them start to adopt it. I think, you know, long term, the companies that are really in trouble with it aren't actually the people that are making the creations. You know, the editors and the video producers and stuff like that. It's the, you know, stock footage sites. I think, you know, the story blocks of the worlds, the motion arrays of the world's uh companies like that are going to be the real ones that are the ones that are like really hit by this in my opinion.\n\nMy first question, I guess maybe more geared toward uh, Bilawal here. Um, I'm curious what's going to surprise us because I've always had the suspicion that like tools like Unreal Engine are going to come into play and be a a real or um because what's the one tool that you sent me? It was like Skyglass, where you could like turn yourself in real time into these like 3D avatars. I'm I'm still really curious about that like in the more like almost like game engine space. What do you see coming like in that area or like in general, like with the 3D space, like what could surprise us over the next for the rest of the year, I guess?\n\nYeah. I think like the video to 3D leap, and this is where I go back and forth where a part of me, like I would say last year if we had talked, I was like really bullish on 3D as like the intermediate state where you need like a 3D representation of everything so I can move the Camera around, move entities around, and you've got this scene graph, you maybe toss into a model like the new Runway model and have it kind of take it all the way, handle different entities differently. Oh, the character is supposed to be this, the background's supposed to be this. I think there's going to be two things that are going to be very interesting, and you know, like one is like the stuff Luma Labs is doing. So this is like Fale Lee's company that's trying to do to start out like text and image to 3D worlds. I think that's going to reach a quality where we were with like Midjourney v4 like 2 years ago or something like that, and we're all going to be like, \"Holy [ __ ], we can actually do this with large-scale 3D scenes.\" I think that's going to be very exciting just for like, \"I made my environment once, and this is the environment I want to shoot everything in consistently.\" The other is there's this company, there's this startup that's a like some ex-Unity and uh, uh, Electronic Arts folks called Intangible AI. They're going to be coming out and like decloaking in the next month or so. You can still look them up and stuff, but they're trying to solve this problem of like, \"How do I just say stuff to create a 3D scene that you can then have control over, but then you plug in all the video models and image models to kind of take it all the way.\" I used to play with this workflow a lot, but again, you have to open up like Blender, then you need to know how to use Blender or Maya or like do some other [ __ ] like this is going to just make it so so much faster. Yeah, exactly. This Yeah. So what you literally say stuff, and you can create like 3D environments, and everything just works. So like if you've got like a road that's going through a forest, and I want to move the road over, you move the just drag the road over, and the forest will kind of get out of the way. It's almost making like these really high-end tools like Houdini, etc., accessible. But then the really crazy part is since Flux and Luma and all these image and video models have gotten so good, like if let's say you have a shot like of a freaking Jeep that's like going through a forest, and you're like, \"I want the exact reverse shot of that like this.\" You're like, \"I want the exact reverse shot of that Jeep right now.\" It's like a lot of crazy prompting. Maybe your background will still kind of change even with things like Flow. I think that hybrid approach is going to make us very, very excited. Maybe the last prediction is I've got a feeling going back to our homie James Cameron, you know, those moments of delight we had with like voice models where you're like getting a voice model to almost act out and play a role. Imagine a couple of those in a shot where like you're literally the director, and you're sort of like conducting this performance between different entities in a scene. You're already kind of seeing that in a more asynchronous like offline process fashion with things like Flow and Google VEO 3, where you're kind of giving it a high-level prompt of like street interviews, and it's coming up with the jokes. You're not necessarily prompting the jokes. I think the same thing's going to happen, and to just go back to what Matt said. I think that's where the creatives are going to get empowered, man. Like rather than you worrying about this is exactly the dialogue you have to see, you go back to being the creative director, the conductor of the orchestra. And I think like that's what I think is going to blow our minds is like 3D is going to finally reach where images were a couple years ago, and maybe this hybrid approach of like, you know,\n\n\nKind of real time and offline is going to kind of come together in a very interesting way.\n\nWe, I also want to just like add too, I don't really think, you know, there's the whole narrative too that it's like going to kill human creativity, and you know, so I still think that people are really, really going to value when humans do cool [ __ ], right? Like, like I don't know if you guys have seen the studio with Seth Rogan, so it's this Apple TV show with Seth Rogan. He's like, he just becomes like the studio head of this like, you know, um, fictional like Hollywood studio, but the way it's shot, I am watching that thing in awe of like how the cinematographers and the director of photography are like setting up these shots, and they have an like episodes two called episode two is called the where the whole episode was done in a single take. It's like a 30-minute episode where it was all just one take, and you watch this thing and it still blows your mind that like humans built this. And so like the whole narrative of like, you know, AI is going to kill that human creativity, I still think humans are going to like love the fact that other humans created this. I just think it's creating like a new genre, right? I think there's going to be the the stuff that humans create that we're all super, super impressed with that humans created. And then there's also going to be the stuff that, you know, we were able to, you know, get way more creative and use our imagination and do the stuff we never thought possible because AI now helps us do that thing. And they're just going to be two separate genres. They're not mutually exclusive, that we're still all going to appreciate both of them ideally. You know, that may almost makes me want to flip a question back to you, Riley. Like when you hear this conversation, especially like to Matt's point of like there's this like either creators super leaning into this stuff or people are like literally putting their heads in the sand saying this is like the like devil incarnate. It's killing the craft. What do you see on the vibe coding side? Like is there like cuz I see occasionally some posts people are like super negative about like kind of the vibe coding approach to building stuff out. Obviously, it's a spectrum, right? Like the way like you and your co-founders are using stuff. Like obviously y'all are like cracked folks. So you're doing like maybe more advanced workflows, consensus polling, different models, and then there's like the newbie that comes around and tries to vibe code stuff. But in general, are you seeing like a positive or negative response to sort of the explosion of software that we're going to see too, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I think, are you, are you saying the the reaction from pe people about other vibe coders or reaction from the Yeah. Like how, how are like the programmers reacting to a lot more people becoming programmers now, I guess, like or vibe coders or whatever. I honestly think it's it's uh, it's the midwit meme, you know. I think the people in the middle are the most upset about it, and I think genuinely believe that the most crapped pe I've never met like a really good developer who's like really good who doesn't just love it, and they're just they're chilling, you know, and they and and they're loving using the tools, and they're like admittedly lazy about certain things. I mean, Andre Carpathy, who's like a god at this, like he's the one who's just like just throw it together and and just just vibe code it. And I mean, he's not saying to do it for everything, but I think I think what vibe coding is doing for people is it's getting people to the aha moment. And if you want to go further and learn more, you can, but you can select which part you learn. I think because I do think there's a large crowd of saying everything is slop and the same way that uh people are saying about AI generated video right now. And um, I think as the tech gets better, I personally am taking a big bet personally like that AI coding models are going to get so good that it's just going to do everything end to end. Um, it'll debug your code after you, it'll check for security issues. We're already working on that. It's so true. It applies exactly the same thing is playing out in media generation, right? Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I' I've seen the same thing, right? Like I I'll talk about, you know, Cursor and Windurf and Factory AI and all of these various like coding platforms on my YouTube channel, and you know, I I see kind of the same sentiment around it. Um, I think more and more developers and coders are coming around to the fact that, oh yeah, AI is getting better really, really fast, and yeah, it is going to be able to do my coding for me in the future. That doesn't necessarily mean they're happy or excited about it. I think that sort of stresses a lot of developers out. It makes developers worried about what their future career path looks like. But I think most of them are coming around the idea that yeah, this is going to be able to do my job pretty soon. 100%. And I guess I guess a fun thing to do before we before we end here, a lot of people who watch this are going to be working in a business or business owners um or aspiring small business owners. And I'm curious with this new technology, Google Veo with Luma Labs, obviously we have Runway, CL, I'm sure Clling, I I know that these other models are going to be releasing soon. They're all going to compete with Google Veo. Audio is going to be embedded in all of them. How what would your guys strategy be? I guess if you were me right now and you wanted to grow grow a product like like mine, like that is my job now, like we have to do that. like how would you guys use AI to um increase revenue?\nGPT 03\nasking what do you do with your life?\nNo, no, I'm joking. I mean, honestly, it's just like you. It depends. It's so contextual, right? Like I mean even simple things like, oh gosh, you're like a small restaurant and you want to update your photos on freaking like uh, you know, Uber Eats or whatever, take Camera photos and then use the new full row to swap out the background or use concept to swap out the background cockroaches from the restaurant. Yeah, exactly. I mean, like there's so many like, you know, for product photography if you're selling stuff online. Oh, in your bedroom, you're like taking photos of sneakers, now you can make it look like a professional like, you know, shoot. Same thing for like video stuff. It's funny. I think there's already so much like kind of faux UGC content that's flowing around. I don't know how I feel about like the ethics of faux UGC like masquerading as real UGC, but clearly people are doing it. And gosh, I mean, I don't know. It's like everything from like the descript style editing tools and then like all the video tools that are almost like a replacement for a Camera that you might have to go and shoot in person. Like if you're making memes, you want to make memes around like the founders of your company, use that as like character references and make a bunch of funny videos with like Google VEO 3 and Flow. I mean, this the world is your oyster truly packaging all of that content. I don't know, man. Like there's just so many things that you can do. It's like the main thing you can't do is like not try these things and then pick the ones that work and integrate them into your workflow. That's that's like the general piece of advice I've been giving to everyone, like it's just like the one thing you can't do is ignore these tools. Yeah. Yeah. No, and I totally agree with that. you know, the the I I posted um something on on X a couple weeks ago and at first it it went well and then, you know, after it it started to go viral, it got all the hate, but it was like I posted a headline of something that was like the people who refuse to use AI and I posted like this is in a couple years this is going to look like the people who refuse to use the internet, right? Like why are you trying to avoid this stuff? like you're just going to close your eyes and pretend this doesn't exist and it's not going to just like disappear because you decide you don't like it and you're not going to use it. The companies aren't going to be like, &quot;Oh, you know, Karen over there said she's not using this. Let's stop, right? It's it's not going to happen. It's going to only get better. It's only going to get more prolific. You like you got to go use it.&quot; So, definitely echoing Bilawal there. But I also think we are entering a world where when it comes to marketing, the marketers who lean into the human element the most are probably going to be the ones that win, right? The ones that actually put their real face on video, the ones that go on podcasts, the ones that are, you know, actually at events that you could go and like walk up to the booth and talk to the companies. I think the human element becomes more and more important, right? Like how often are we hearing about like the dead internet theory now, right?\nI never even\nlike at least once a week because of all the AI and all the on reply to my comments. Like at this point I'm just assuming like 50% of them aren't even real people or same with the comments on YouTube, right? And so I think we're kind of coming into this world now where like if you sort of lean into the human element with your marketing and you become like the figure head for your product and you put out videos into the world and you're on social media showing that you're a real person, not being an anonymous, you know, avatar. Um, I think that's only going to help with your marketing in a world where like increasingly we can't tell the difference between real and fake anymore. Yeah, I think I think you just don't want to be in between because while I do I'm I am fully investing like for the rest of my life I'm fully investing in in um I think um I I tweeted about it the other day. The idea of elite media or media where like you want to be out there, you want it to be highly opinionated. Uh you want it to be natural, free flowing human content. I think that's really important. I do think on the other side though, I think we are going to see some Vibe marketers, maybe that's not the right term, win where they're sitting in front of a computer, you know, maybe they have a $100,000 per month budget and they are just cranking away at Google VEO 3 and they're basically testing every hook and this is what will create the the dead internet theory where they're just throwing things up, seeing what's working. It's purely metric driven. It's just like the the algorithms on social media. You're just feeding what the algorithm wants. I think we're going to see a shortterm period where that strategy will win. I just don't think it's a good long-term strategy. Yeah. Well, and just to just to sort of, you know, lean into that a little bit, I think that will be a strategy that will work for getting you views on content. Right. If your if your business, if your model is to get viewers to watch your content, I definitely think that you can fully use AI, not be on camera, not be a, you know, a real human behind it and deliver that dopamine drip that people want, right? Create that content that has the, you know, appealing visuals and it, you know, delivers the information or um, you know, delivers that sort of brain rot content, whatever you want to call it, that delivers the dopamine hit that people enjoy that content. If your goal is to get more views, I definitely think you can lean into AI to do that. I think if your goal is to sell more product um of something else, like use like like if you're trying to like market a business, I feel like that's going to be less effective in a world where people are, you know, increasingly wondering what's real or not. I think if you're trying to sell products, at least in the the current phase we're at now, this could be a different different thing a year from now where we can't even tell if the like spokesperson of a product is actually real or not, which we probably will get there, but right now where you can still kind of tell, I just think like being that real human is going to help you sell more products if we're talking about marketing from that perspective.\nI mean, the way the way I'd split the difference on what you guys are saying is like I I think it's going to be both, right? It always is. I mean, we have mascots of companies that are essentially like, you know, animated characters that are sort of the brand. We've had the VTuber thing. Japan still loves Vtubing. I think there's going to be certain people that are just going to be like, I don't know, we're going to basically have characters that stick around, you know, till kingdom come and we'll take advantage of these new technologies. And maybe as a company you kind of want that like sort of somebody who can always evolve with the times, isn't subject to aging and kind of like you know we're going to we're going to have what 20 30 40 more years of doing this type of stuff and like some of this stuff's going to stick around forever. And kind of one of a cringe example to look back at here is like did you all ever catch when KFC did a rebrand to make like a Gen Z friendly kernel? I don't know if you also they made this like salt and pepper like you know like uh like a kind of really slick back hair kind of kernel and I think you're going to see so much more of that where like brands are going to have their own like digital characters that are essentially like for theirs to puppeteer and control. I think that's going to be amaz and same thing with like longtail content. Like a lot of the stuff that is can and maybe should be automated is going to turn into being consumed maybe by these type of avatars. But on the other hand, man, you're right. Like Matt, you're dead on like there's so much push for like real world in-person authentic connection. There's so much of a push back against a retention editing on on YouTube as well. But it's just going to be both simultaneously. And I think I'd be remiss if we don't talk about this is like when a lot of people talk about both vibe coding and sort of the video stuff. I think the people who get [ __ ] the most like I think it's not cool to say that oh like everything is going to be like totally fine. I think entrylevel folks are going to kind of get screwed\n\n\nLike whether it's entry-level creators, whether it's entry-level developers, like that's the stuff that's going to get automated first.\nAnd I don't know, maybe there's a massive value expansion in the demand for media and software, but I don't know, we still have 24 hours in a day.\nSo with that in mind, I hope the algorithms for these platforms also think about if you're looking for more like authentic content, how do you get more of that and less of the sort of retention edited slop that's also going to indendate these platforms, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, you do have, you know, Tony the Tiger and Geico the Gecko, you know, stuff like that.\nYeah.\nAll the serial mascots, if you will, too, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nWhere, you know, they've used those as the mascots.\nSo, I do think there'll be an element of that.\nI think I don't know.\nI just have this theory that in an AI world where that becomes easier and easier to do, it also becomes harder and harder to use that as like your sort of marketing gimmick, but I don't know.\nI could be totally wrong there.\nNo, no, I that is another thing is is like as as it becomes easier, if anyone can do it, then yeah, it loses its novelty.\nUm, yeah, it's going to be an very very interesting time.\nAnd so, yeah, I'm really excited.\nUm, I guess I guess we'll do a final final words.\nWhat is your I'll go each of you.\nWhat is your prediction by the end of the year?\nThe biggest thing that you think will happen in the AI video space?\nI actually hate making predictions because I'm usually like way off on my timelines.\nOkay, fine.\nWhat do you hope happens?\nWhat What would you love to see in the AI video space?\nI would love to be able to make a 10-minute video with consistent characters and audio that's perfectly lip-s synced.\nAnd I think by the end of the year, I think maybe bleeding into next year, early next year, but I think by the end of the year, we should be able to be there.\nYeah, I would totally plus one that.\nAnd I was going to say three to five minutes instead of 10.\nAnd but we're all just like, you know, kind of grasping at straws here anyway.\nI think maybe the other piece is I hope we see a little more progress on 3D.\nI think it's the multimodal stuff is really exciting.\nThe fact that these models have such good multiv- view consistency that you can run it through like a Nerf or Gaussian splatting app to like turn it into a 3D model is super exciting.\nI'm hoping we start seeing really good quality like text and image to 3D environments and characters, not just objects and things like that.\nAnd hopefully we start seeing the earliest signs of sort of like 4D 3D as well where like animated you know spatial uh you know media starting to pop on the scene.\nI I hope we get like the earliest signs of that.\nMaybe that's more in a research capacity but already some of the results there.\nTaking advantage of the world knowledge of these diffusion models and being able to do some stuff is like kind of crazy.\nAnd so, um, yeah, short form videos with like consistent entities, and then maybe the earliest signs of 3D environments, characters, and maybe even some 4D.\nYeah, I guess I guess I'll go.\nUm, my my prediction, my hope is I want this in real time.\nLike, um, what's the Unreal Engine extension?\nOr is it like called Cam Link or Oh, yeah, totally.\nYeah, VLink [ __ ] really high quality 3D models.\nI want to make a high quality 3D model of my face and I want to be able to use it in real time.\nI don't know what computer I need to do that, but I just want that tech to be more accessible.\nI used that a few uh a few weeks ago.\nSomeone who that's what they did for a living showed me it and I was like, why?\nWhat is the barrier that's causing people not to like have this?\nAnd it feels like it's just like compute at this point.\nAnd like I think that's going to be really fun.\nUm and so that's kind of my hope by the end of the day.\nDude, if you haven't checked out the new Unreal 5 announcements, you have to cuz like the advancements they've made there to like puppeteer those characters is really cool.\nAnd there's a few apps out there that'll make that meta human character for you.\nYou have to like move your head to the left and right up and down and kind of do the scan.\nBut it'll do the manual like the [ __ ] that you had to do with a photo scan bringing it into like Unreal was like multiple steps.\nThat's already collapsed to an app already, which is cool.\nAnd uh and yeah, some of the epic announcements are just, for the lack of better word, epic.\nAmazing.\nWell, thank you guys for uh coming on the pod.\nUh this was a lot of fun.\nWe covered a lot of stuff.\nUm and yeah, appreciate it.\nKeep vibing, Riley.\nGood to see you guys.\n",
