  "cleanText": "The AI browsing revolution is here. DIA Browser is the first tool I would truly call the cursor for web browsing. In this video, I'm going to break down the five features that make DIA Browser essential for content creators, marketers, and business owners like me. I'll walk you through every single feature, show you exactly how I use them in my daily workflow, and explain why this represents the future of AI enhanced browsing. And I'm also going to discuss how I think DIA and other AI powered browsers like Comet by Perplexity are going to progress as time goes on. Let's dive into the video.\n\nSo this right here is DIA Browser. As you can see, it looks like, you know, kind of just a standard ordinary browser. We have these side panels, which is very similar to Arc. If we open up new tabs, we can type in ESPN.com. We can type in twitter.com. We have these tabs here on the side. We can then type in DIA Browser. What we can do is we can press command-click to open these up into a new tab. Vertical tab options is available. That seems relevant. I might want to check that out later. Um, this guy's opinion. Let's get Morgan's opinion. That's really interesting. Here's Nick Dobos who actually works at DIA Browser. Let's go ahead and open that up into a new tab. And the reason I'm doing this is let's say I'm writing a newsletter post about the new DIA Browser. What we can do here is we can just type in content calendar. And so let's imagine for a second that we wanted to create a new newsletter on the new DIA Browser. Let's say for a second that we wanted to write it in the same tone as the rundown AI. So, we could go to the rundown AI and we now have this open. Let's say I wanted to write a newsletter. I could now open up this chat with document, which is where all of the magic happens. Whenever people say the cursor for blank, it usually means familiar interface, which is a browser with a side panel that has AI that has context over what you're doing and can actually take actions and do things for you. And let me show you what it can do. We can actually at certain tabs, right? We can at the rundown newsletter and say, I want you to write in the style of the newsletter and tell me about the new DIA Browser. Search internet. Then include all of the opinions I have open. And because we opened up in new tabs like these four opinions from other people across Twitter, it can actually use them. And it would be kind of annoying if we had to at@mention all of them. I'm going to close out of ESPN because it's not relevant. But I can just go at all open tabs. And now you can see all of them get added to this context right here. Now we can just press run. And so now it's going to go through all of these and then it's going to write a newsletter. And because I'm in Notion and my cursor is right here, the output that it creates, I'm going to be able to insert all of the output into whatever I'm writing immediately. And I'll show you how that works after it's done.\n\nAnd look at this. So, it has this write thing that we can copy. We could copy and paste it. But what's cool at the end here, if we wanted to insert it, we just press insert. And so there we go. It inserts it into Notion. No matter where we're typing, we can just press insert and it will insert it very easily right here.\n\nAnd let's say, for example, that you're like, \"Oh my god, this is awesome. I love the tone of this. I want to use this later.\" That's no problem. What we could do is we could actually right-click on this and we could hit add to bookmarks bar. And what we can do is when we open up a new tab, we'll see the bookmarks bar. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit new folder and I'm going to say voice. And I'm just going to call I'm going to rename this to rundown voice. And so I'm going to drag that into the voice folder. And now we have all of our folders neatly organized in folders. And I have this voice tab right here with rundown voice. So now let's imagine that we didn't have this open later and we're writing this article. Um I could let's say I'm creating I just create a new page right here on Notion. Now search the internet tell me about the new meta AI news with open AI. Do it in the voice of at and I can just type in voice and we are now just pasting in that bookmark. So bookmarks bar voice you can reference things that you save as bookmarks and so if you get in the habit of that and you save things in an organized manner you can always mention them when you're using them in line. So now it's actually just going to search for the new news on open AAI and Meta which you know Meta is trying to poach all of their employees. It's looking for it four days people. Here's what Mark Zuckerberg you can see it's going through all of them. And so now it's saying good morning AI enthusiasts which is exactly if we go to a new tab and we open up rundown voice. Let's see how he starts it. We say good morning AI enthusiasts right and so it is actually using this as an example. And again when we are in the notion page right here all we have to do is press insert and there we go. One thing it's really good at is on YouTube. Let's say we're on YouTube and we now, okay, cursor replaces your entire business. Let's go ahead and click on this podcast by Greg Eisenberg. Let's imagine for a second that we wanted to chat with this video. You can absolutely do that. And so I am doing research for my podcast and want the key quotes from this video. Um, seven of them. Please give me these quotes. One, two, two, no, let's say two to three sentences long. A after reading these quotes, I want to accurately understand the overall arc of this entire video. So, make sure that these are both standalone, but also share the full story of the episode if I read them all in order. And so, here we go. We can now press enter. And it has context of everything. And here it here we go. It is writing all of these. So, and you know what? I really like this. I'm going to let's say for example I'm going to use this research prompt over and over and over again. What we can do is we can press this little heart button and we can save this as a custom skill. So we're going to just call this quote summary. And this all has to be one word because check this out. Let's say for example we're on a new tab and we're on YouTube and let's say we're watching another video. What we can do is we can hit chat with this video and we can just hit this slash button and we can go down to quote summary and we can press enter and it's going to do that exact thing. And so this right here is a skill. So you can now repeat these prompts, right? Because that is what I think people have always wanted. They want something that's contextually aware and then whenever they come up with a really good prompt, they want to be able to reuse that prompt over and over again. And since you can save these as little skills, you don't have to write things out over and over again. You can find useful things that you do on your browser and then do them over and over again really fast. And then you could take these quotes and you could just say at all open tabs and say how will DIA Browser affect sohome you know I wouldn't you know it doesn't really this is not a realistic question. And I wouldn't ask this, but like you can take the outputs of your skill and then quickly reference them with all of your different tabs. And now you can find these connections between different ideas and you kind of treat your browser base or your DIA Browser like a codebase and you're constantly referencing things and you can very quickly change the context of your AI chat.\n\nOkay, so what have we talked about so far? I want to make sure that you guys fully understand why I think this is such a big deal, right? Um, a normal browser, right, if you used Arc browser, you just had, you know, this normal browser experience with tabs, right? You can save tabs, you can save these tabs as bookmarks, but now you have tabs. You still have these bookmarks that you can save, right? And not only can you save these bookmarks, you can also kind of like save these folders of bookmarks. And so you can have these folders with bookmarks that you can mention at any time. And so what I'm thinking right now, and again, I've only been using this browser for a few days. And so here's kind of my plan, right? Like I want I'm going to have a folder for voices as we as we created today. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to find like my newsletter voice and just save like really good examples of my best newsletters in my own voice. And I'm going to save that to a folder so I can very quickly reference it. Right? I post a lot of Twitter videos. So Twitter video text, right? In the text that comes before the Twitter video. It's very important. It's like the thumbnail of Twitter. It's how you frame the videos in the feed. I'm going to keep a bunch of good examples in a document and keep them there. If we just type in docs.google.com, google.com. What we can do here is we can actually go to my Twitter and we can actually sort by um let's say sort by highlights and we can pick the best videos. And so this is a video setup. This one is short and sweet. So we could actually copy this to a new Google doc and we could just paste this in right here. And we'll go heading one. And we'll go um post one. We could go post two. Uh post three. And we could um basically um find our best one. So, this one did it. This one did pretty well. So, we can actually copy this whole thing. Let's go ahead and paste this one here. And then let's do that one more time. Okay. Yeah, this one was a really good one. So, we can copy this. This one was really simple. We'll paste this one here. So, these are three posts. And what we can do is I'm going to just name this uh we'll call these Twitter video text. And then what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to save this add to bookmarks bar. And so when we go to the bookmarks bar, we see Twitter video text. We can drag this into voice. So let's say I have descript right here, which has the full transcript of my video. I can press chat and then I can very quickly say at Twitter video text. I know this is open, right? So I can mention it because the tab is open. But if this wasn't open, we can still mention it by going Twitter um video text. This one isn't really popping up right here. I don't like that it's not popping up with the name, but I think they're going to fix that. But I know that this is mentioning that because it's in the voice folder. But we could actually mention that as a voice and say please um create uh three options for Twitter uh video text based on this uh transcript in the style of the uh Twitter video voice ones. And so now it's reading both attachments. It's reading both this.\n\nLook at this. This is the new way to build AI. No code, no stress. With any end, you can create agent workflows that replace entire teams. I'll show you how to connect them, test them, and even have agents delegate to each other. Plus, you'll see how to plug these workflows into your own custom apps. If you want to automate your business without writing a single line of code, this video is for you. This is exactly in the voice. And it gives us these three options, right? It's so cool how it gives us these three options. And, you know, I could actually just like comment on this. So on um let's say I was communicating with my team, I could just like comment this and now we can just insert this as a comment and I could just say uh at Emily uh please use this in the text post that you post. Um and we can then use it in a future video. And we entered that into the comments. Very quick, very easy. And honestly, as I'm doing this right now, like that is 100% going to be my workflow, right? Um, we could have one that is like just like YouTube uh description voice because these are all different voices. Um, we could have a short form scripts. I'm also going to have um long form hooks. Right? So in notion, right, if we actually go to notion, I've already done this. So in notion we log into notion and if I just type in command K you can very this is just a notion tip. We can just type in long form uh examples Riley or long form hooks either one. These are um some good hook examples that we can do for our videos. These are our top performing ones. What we can do is we can again come over here. We can add to bookmarks bar and then I'm going to drag this into voice. Now we have long form hooks. And so let's say that in notion um we're going to be talking about we're doing a long form video on this topic right here um which is the meta meta poaching open AI employees. All we need to do is come here. We type at long form long form hooks in notion and then we can say please write three options um for a hook on this topic and then we always have um these voices that we can use for content right so if I'm writing the intro this is the body you know let's imagine I'm writing it here we can now very quickly insert a highquality intro that's contextually aware based on all of my past high-erforming long- form hooks. Um, as you can see here, Meta is handing out $100 million offers to lure OpenAI researchers. Is this just talent arms race or the start of something much bigger for AI? Let's break down what's actually going on behind the headlines. We can insert this directly in the script. We have option one, two, and three. We could just put all three options in if we wanted to, right? Um, if we wanted to just give options to someone on our team, this is very cool and we can very quickly edit this. And yeah, I think that's really, really powerful. So, that's kind of how I'm going to use bookmarks is I'm going to definitely have these voices that I can use. Um, I'm also going to have like um core business context. Um, right. And these are ones that I would\n\n\nProbably like to keep more private, right?\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to keep um like uh financial metrics.\nUm we will have um all of our content metrics.\nI'm also going to have um competitor metrics.\nSo with tools like N8N, you can create um automations, right?\nWe could create an automation in theory, right?\nThat basically automatically pulls in data and puts it into one single spreadsheet.\nAnd that becomes much more valuable with Vibe browsing tools, right?\nIf we're creating a workflow, let's say we had a workflow that basically um that we created that triggers, you know, we could trigger it every day.\nSo like on a schedule, uh we basically trigger an automation that um that pulls in from Google Sheets.\nYou know, I'm just showing you a random example.\nAnd it basically updates a Google Sheets whatever like document that we have here, right?\nThis will basically um let's say we had a sheet uh we could have this sheet called like company KPIs which are like most important things in the company.\nAll right.\nAnd we had this sheet update here.\nWhat you could do is you could actually go to sheets.google.com.\nWe actually do have this, but I don't want to show our company metrics right now.\nUm, but let's just say our MRR was uh 10,000 um and our spend last month was was 20,000.\nRight?\nAll you'd have to do is call this uh company uh KPIs.\nAnd what you could do is you could very easily just add this to bookmarks bar.\nAnd then you could toss this into what I just put into the metrics finance.\nAnd then anytime you are talking to someone, let's say we're on LinkedIn, which I don't know why you would ever be on that site, um let's say that you were messaging someone within the chat, you could just go at um you know, uh at company KPIs and you can say like what is the um what is our key data up to date?\nAnd obviously there's only like three fields or four fields filled in on this and it's going to get it really quickly, but this could be all of your company data or all of your most important data.\nAnd if you keep it on sheet one, I think it will actually navigate to it and find that information.\nAnd as you can see here, it pulled the 10,000 and 20,000 MR 10,000 spend last month 20,000.\nAnd let's say you had a voice for emails and linked in DMs.\nLet's say you had a voice for that.\nWhat we could do is you could very easily reference that right here in this chat.\nAnd so here we have this kind of bookmark context.\nSo you have immediate access to your bookmarks.\nNot only that, right?\nNot only that, but you also have this access to all of your open tabs.\nAnd you can very easily reference these open tabs just by going at all open tabs, right?\nAll you have to do is go all at all open tabs.\nAnd you have very easy access to all of your tabs and you can just chat with all of them.\nSo if you're doing research, just have 10 open tabs open and then you can chat with all of your open tabs very quickly.\nAnd so not only do you have bookmarks, but you have quick tab access.\nAnd then the final thing that we did talk about briefly are skills.\nAnd so I think that the future of the DIA Browser is going to rest in skills.\nAnd I don't think it's just going to be like memorizing prompts.\nI think this is going to have to do with using tools and external tools to actually do things on your behalf like a Slack tool that allows you to take in information with your quick tab access bookmarks and the kind of built-in memory into the platform.\nAnd you're going to be able to take actions with it.\nLike you're going to be able to send something to Slack, you're going to be able to send an email in the background.\nAnd the these skills, right, that you that you can access by pressing slash are going to allow you to do things that actually send data off the platform.\nYou can communicate with other people.\nYou can do deeper research.\nYou can do um use all of the external tools because that's what I think the future of browsing is is this kind of free form um access to all of your data as well as being able to communicate with others.\nAnd so that's kind of where I see this going.\nAnd so in this case, right, you can have like you can have like specific custom summaries, custom summaries.\nAnd I haven't even really scratched the surface on specific skills, but these are basically at for the time being just like good prompts uh you can use at any time.\nAnd that's kind of the basic premise of the DIA Browser so far.\nIt's kind of this quick tab access.\nYou have access to bookmarks.\nYou have access to skills.\nThey did talk about how it has like good memory of what you've been up to.\nLike I'm pretty sure you can go like history browser history.\nLike what have I done recently on DIA?\nBut like this hasn't worked for me so far.\nLike I don't have direct access to your personal browsing history.\nUm, and so this would be a really cool feature.\nAnd again, this is a brand new tool and I'll explore it a lot more, but I'm very excited by just these three things, which is like permanent access to bookmarks from this AI chat, uh, quick tab access, skills, and then like another main thing that it has is like I really like the quick insert.\nAnd again, if you like any prompt, you can actually save it as a custom skill.\nI don't actually want to do that.\nBut you can see all of your skills right here.\nLike I have summary quick quote summary.\nUh custom skill.\nThere's no prefix here.\nUm I can actually delete that.\nI don't need that.\nHere you have code skills.\nSo what are your preferences for coding?\nUm I have not set that up yet.\nI haven't seen a huge reason to do this.\nBut you can also specify the voice like how you want Dia to write and who do you um who inspire or who inspires you or shapes your taste.\nI just put Naval Ravocant.\nUm how do you best digest information?\nUm you can actually really customize it here.\nAnd so this is kind of the bare bones of Dia Browser.\nI feel like they're going to add so many cool future features going forward.\nThis video is not sponsored by them.\nI'm just really passionate about the future of Vibe browsing because I just think browsers are outdated.\nJust the same way that Google's outdated and it's being replaced by chat GBT.\nI think the way that we browse the internet is outdated and it's going to be replaced by something much smarter.\nIs it going to be DIA?\nI have no idea.\nComet is coming out.\nPerplexity's web browser and I'm going to do a video on that one as well and there's a chance it's going to be better.\nWho knows?\nAnd so I just think my five biggest things that I'm really excited about is just kind of this quick tab AI access.\nLike I can just very quickly open up a new tab and immediately chat with AI or navigate with it.\nAnd it seems like very snappy and very fast.\nUh along with the quick insert, the quick tab access, um access to your bookmarks permanently as context.\nAnd then uh skills, right?\nYou can create custom skills.\nAnd I think that this right this right here is the biggest opportunity.\nI think that this is going to be what u makes this tool um futuristic like over the next year.\nI think we're going to see the biggest um advancements in the skills because I don't I don't even think we're even scratching the surface.\nAnd so yeah, this is Vibe Browsing.\nThis is DIA Browser and these are my honest thoughts.\nI'll see you here in the next video.\n",
