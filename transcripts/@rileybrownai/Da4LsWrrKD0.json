  "cleanText": "So it's receiving the chat message and then that's going into this AI agent node.\nSo, basically what this AI agent node is, it's a node that is accessing different tools.\nI have a video to newsletter workflow set up separately that I've brought into the agent.\nI want you to tell me if this is a good definition.\nVibe marketing is a way of running your Marketing Team or any business by wiring smart AI tools together.\nSo most of the busy work happens automatically.\nInstead of writing a blog post, brainstorming social hooks, for example, or crunching keyword data by hand, you plug a few smart tools into one chat window and let them do most of the heavy lifting.\nAnd then a quote is like, \"I alone can outcompete marketing teams of 10 or more.\"\nWould you say that is a good understanding?\nI think you're spot on.\nAnd, uh, to sort of illustrate like a real use case of how all this came about, I'll give you a little story here.\nSo for the past couple years, I was running like this kind of AI-assisted SEO agency.\nWe used AI to help create content and stuff like that, but a lot of the work that we did was still like heavily manual.\nYou know, people were going into tools to find keywords.\nThey were writing.\nThey were going out there and doing link building.\nAnd I was like blown away as to honestly how slow that things were moving and I was like there has to be a better way to do this.\nSo we cracked open n8n and just started like hacking away at stuff and over the course of a couple months we were able to reduce our team size, increase our output, and save $15,000 a month on payroll.\nSo our cost went from $15,000 a month to like $300 or $400 a month.\nRevenue went up.\nClients are happier.\nThey're getting better results.\nSo I was like, there's got to be something here.\nSo we started to explore all kinds of other use cases of what we could automate in marketing and we just started sharing that stuff and it kind of blew us away.\nThat's insane.\nWhy don't we first go through an example of a workflow that would actually help people out?\nYou got it.\nOkay, cool.\nI've set up a few things for you here today like, uh, all around VibeCode App.\nI'll just dive in and and show you an ad in here.\nI'm going to share my screen.\nSo, you create a lot of like YouTube and and video content, right?\nYes.\nAll right, cool.\nOne of the best use cases and a really great way to start with Vibe Marketing is with content repurposing.\nSo, you create a video or whatever that's a great top-of-funnel asset that's helping you get exposure.\nIt's growing your audience, but maybe you have a newsletter where you're giving more information about your product and service, and you want to repurpose some of that video content so that you can send out emails to keep people engaged.\nSo, what I'm showing you right here is a YouTube video to newsletter issue or whatever other kind of like written content repurposing workflow.\nAll you need to do in this workflow is provide an example URL.\nSo, in this case, I did your most recent YouTube video and then I just have a a couple sentences of instruction.\nYou can make this a lot deeper with some guidelines around how you want the content to turn out, your brand voice, however you may prompt for that.\nSo, I just say, \"Write a newsletter based on this video.\nUse the exact voice style that I use in the video.\"\nSo, I'll just show you live how this works.\nI'm going to copy and paste this into here and we'll talk through the different steps of what it's doing along the way.\nSo, I send it in the chat window here.\nThis is a trigger in in the trigger is when a chat message is received, which we just went over, start the workflow.\nSo it's receiving the chat message and then that's going into this AI agent node.\nSo basically what this AI agent node is, it's a node that is accessing different tools.\nI have a video to newsletter workflow set up separately that I've brought into the agent.\nBasically what that's doing is transcribing the video.\nIt's understanding the context.\nIt's saving it in this memory node and then I have an LLM that's accessing it and kind of rewriting it into the content that I want.\nSo, I'll pause for a second and make sure that that makes sense.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd so, I just want to make sure that for those who are new, like 100% maybe you've heard of chat GBT and you want to dive a little bit further.\nWould you agree that it's pretty poorly explained in the social media atmosphere?\nMost of the times when people are saying AI agent, what they really have is like a workflow.\nAnd right here, we have a workflow with some memory and a task.\nSo, in that context, we're calling that an AI agent.\nI think the true definition of an AI agent in a year from now in this space is going to be completely different.\nIt's going to be something fully autonomous.\nYou give it a prompt.\nIt goes out and does all this kind of stuff without you needing to build complex workflows.\nSo that in my mind is like the true definition of what an agent would be.\nDefinitely something to pay attention to.\nLike workflows that have an agent within it is just so incredibly powerful because AI agents not only do they happen automatically right in this case, but you can give agents access to tools and AI agents will decide if they should use the tools or not.\nSo if you think of a normal workflow, it's basically step one, step two, step three, step four, step five, right?\nAnd the first step is a trigger that is some event that happens that triggers the rest of the workflow and each of those is a step in a workflow or an automation would just be this kind of linear path.\nYes, you could create forks in it, but like it basically just deterministically like moves through.\nWhat you can do with agents is you can take any individual step and basically turn it into a tool and give it to an agent.\nAnd then the agent will decide not only what tool to use, but it will actually decide when to stop using tools.\nWhat is the memory step there for?\nThe memory is just storing the output from this tool and then the LLM is accessing the data within that node.\nSo the agent is storing what it does there so then it can, uh, be used in a later step.\nYeah.\nSo this is a tool right here, the video to newsletter repurposing workflow.\nIt's a separate workflow that I'm referencing right here for the agent.\nThe agent is able to access that tool to transcribe a video.\nThe transcription.\nI'm using ampify, which is an awesome library of different web scrapers and things like that.\nSo, it's building the transcription.\nIt's storing it here in this simple memory node and then open router is allowing me to access an LLM.\nI use Claude most times for anything related to content.\nAnd then what it's doing is it's accessing the stored data here so that it can create our newsletter issue.\nAfter that, we've got something created and it's stored within here.\nThe next step is, uh, we're going to instruct n8n to create a Google Doc for us.\nYou know, as as marketers, we don't really have like an IDE or a complicated, you know, development environment or whatever.\nWe work a lot from like Slack and Google Docs and things of that nature.\nSo, if I create a workflow and I'm working with other people that aren't as technical, I need to send that information to a tool or a place that they're they're comfortable with using often times.\nSo, in this case, I'm creating a Google Doc.\nAnd then this merge node, all it's doing is taking this information and putting it into the Google Doc I've created.\nAnd once the the information is in that Google Doc that I've created, I get an updated Google Doc here and it sends it in Slack to me as a message.\nSo it says, \"Hey, here's your completed newsletter.\"\nAnd, uh, I can open it up and and show it to you.\nThat's amazing.\nYou have this workflow that meets you where you are.\nSo you already spend a lot of time in Slack.\nYou got to communicate and boom, you see this agent that just pops up in Slack and it just shows up.\nThat's right.\nSo, I will, uh, screen share another tab and show you some of the outputs that we've created here.\nSo, a couple different newsletter issues.\nI did one for myself earlier.\nI did like a video on cursor recently and MCPs.\nSo, it repurposed that.\nThis is based off the transcription.\nI read through it.\nI thought it was really good.\nIt summarized my video perfectly.\nI'll go ahead and I'll open up yours as well.\nThis is about your vibe designing video that you just recently published on YouTube.\nI think it was like two weeks ago or whatever.\nYou can obviously customize this for your voice, but this is what it created.\nSo, vibe designing build landing pages and apps without code.\nKind of geared toward creators here tells you like what you know you did.\nHere's how we do Vibe designing.\nIt goes through the different steps and talks about the results and what you built and then highlights what you're going to talk about in your next video.\nSo, you can add calls to action in here, anything that you want.\nThe process of simply like uploading the video and then repurposing that into other forms of content is like a huge gain in leverage and efficiency for for marketers, you know, 100%.\nOne way that you can get these automation tools to like write in your voice is Claude can actually ingest PDFs.\nSo on one of those PDF on the clawed tool or the open router tool, for example, you could have an input PDF that is always is just basically a PDF of your 15 best newsletters or your five best newsletters and say here's the tone of my voice match my tone of voice.\nAnd I found that especially as Claude for Opus and Sonnet get better, the more examples you give, the less in actual instructions you need.\nA couple really good examples is worth like two hours of typing out the perfect prompt because AI is often better at finding the pattern in things than than you are at like typing out instructions.\nI don't know if you agree with that.\nI I completely agree.\nI use a lot of different tools to do this.\nI'll scrape my own website for example if I like my copy.\nYou can use like firecrawl for that or something.\nThe more examples you feed into Claude, the more powerful it is.\nI think people get really hung up on like prompting and prompt engineering and stuff like that.\nAnd as the models improve, I think actually prompting as a skill set is less valuable.\nAll you need to do is add enough context into the model and tell it what to do and it produces a pretty killer result for you.\n100%.\nNot enough people are putting these pieces together.\nAnd I think people have heard the concept around MCP and they're not fully wrapping their head around that the tools that we know and love are going to get access to tools.\nI watched your and Greg's last episode.\nYou guys talked about using MCP.\nAnd so I'm wondering if you want to talk about MCP and what it's meant for your business and how you've kind of seen it impact other people.\nLet's do it.\nMCPs for me, like when I first saw a like a Vibe marketing MCP use case in Claude, I was like, this feels right, like this is Vibe marketing to me.\nLike I don't have to go and build a complicated workflow.\nI'm leaning into the power of the model.\nI'm just giving it access to a tool or context so that it can do a job and then I have the full power of Claude 4 opus or sonnid or whatever to build artifacts, to map out landing pages, to create content and I was like, you know, there's not really like a like a cursor or an IDE that marketers work from, but this feels like that to me.\nSo, I got super excited about it.\nAnd, uh, I think the best way is to just kind of show you what it is.\nWhile you're pulling that up, I want to share my magic moment when I realized how big of a deal MCP was.\nOne of them was like my video about it, which was setting up Claude basically as a Blender extension so that you could control Blender just from Claude.\nAnd I asked it to create this castle.\nAnd it was like, are you sure you want to do this?\nAnd I just hit yes, yes, yes.\nAnd then Blender opened up.\nAnd then it built a castle.\nAnd then I was like, can you please make add colors?\nAnd then it just added colors in this is a 3D model.\nAnd then I realized I'm like, oh, this is going to allow people to hook this up into any useful tool that they have.\nIt was blew my mind.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd you know, MCPs in Claude opened my mind up to MCPS and cursors.\nSo over the last few days, I've been doing like cursor deep dives, just understanding like how marketers can use it as a platform because really like it can do a lot more than just like build stuff for you.\nYou can build documents as markdown files.\nYou can pull in context and data and information from these different MCPs and kind of use it as like a hub for like total efficiency across the board, which is just wild.\nAnd Cursor has so much support for MCPs and there's so many new ones coming out all the time.\nYou can go to like Smithery or something like that and find ones that have like solid marketing use cases and essentially get started playing around with those types of tools right away, which is just crazy.\nIt's like the ideal interface, not even just marketing stuff.\nAnd so I'm super excited to see how people mess around with these these new types of interfaces.\nAnyway, I'll let you, I'll let you move to the demo.\nOne last thing on MCPs that I've kind of realized is that I think MCPs will bring about the death of workflows.\nI think that it's kind of like a like an evolution at least for Vibe Marketing.\nYou know, step one is marketers are playing around in, you know, LLMs or siloed tools or whatever and things aren't very connected.\nStage two is you start to build workflows and chain those things together.\nStep three, you discover MCPs.\nAnd then step four, you start messing around with with Cursor and things like that.\nAnd and you realize you can pretty much build whatever.\nYou don't have to go in and configure all these nodes and debug those or whatever when you have agents that can solve that stuff for you.\nWhat you're seeing here in in Claude, I've got some MCPs, uh, that I built in in NADN and integrated into my Claw desktop here.\nSo under the hood when you go into inadin, really what these like little MCP tools are, they're they're super simple.\nSo I've got like ampify and I've got the the web hook or the script that I'm running to go and and scrape.\nAnd then if if I put a couple limits on that on that data so that I don\n\n\nIt's sort of like overload Claude or whatever. That's all it is. So it's like two nodes. It's like start workflow when the command comes in from Claude, and then it's like accessing the API, and then you build your MCP server in n8n, and that's all it is.\n\nSo I wanted to research some of the VibeCode App apps that are out there. So I researched cursor app, repletable, and bolt, and my instruction here is help me fetch the posts one after the other across Reddit and X. And so what it's doing is it's going and scraping X and Reddit to identify what people are talking about with these platforms. I want to find like what are the problems they're facing and what kind of gaps can I go with my marketing efforts.\n\nSo what it did, uh, it accessed the tool here. So you can see within this, it's going and searching Reddit, right? So it's in the vibe coding subreddit. It's pulling different posts and stuff like that to build context on what is going on. It did the same thing for X, and it's going through each of these different platforms across these channels. It fetched 20 posts around the general topic of vibe coding. Talks about tips, experiences, debates, effectiveness, etc. 50 tweets about Vibe coding. Then it did the same thing for each of these individual platforms.\n\nSo real quick, like if you're just using Claude or something out of the box, you don't have all of that context within your LLM. If you're like, hey, like go and research the gaps in the vibe coding space or something, it may hallucinate. It may not have all the data and all the context. This solves that, you know, so that you can build super, super relevant and custom outputs for your marketing efforts. That's really cool. And I think that is actually kind of the what LLMs are missing for a lot of use cases in marketing/communications in general is kind of this contextual understanding that you have control over, right? Because when you ask to create a blog post, it's just like, are you making this for a 22-year-old person who makes a lot of UGC content and they're very tapped in, or is this, you know, a 42-year-old marketer at Microsoft? And you want different contexts for both. So, this is a really interesting way to find context. And it's really cool.\n\nYeah. And one of the most powerful, like, I think that, you know, people often times, like, we have a community, and I talk a lot about this stuff, but like, people are often like, where do I start? What's the first workflow I should build and stuff like that. I actually think that the most powerful workflow that you can start thinking about is one that gives you like a a powerful insight, you know, so getting all the contacts and information about your competitors, finding keywords that people are searching for, stuff like that. Everyone wants to get to the sexy stuff, which is like the end result, the content, the thing that they're making. But really great marketing starts with like a unique angle, a unique insight, something that the market is really going to like take hold on. So that's why I like to start with these research and analysis steps. And if you were to try to do this manually, I mean, we've got, you know, a 100 different Reddit posts here. We've got 250 tweets about these topics. You just literally couldn't do that without this tool, right?\n\nAnd here, yeah, it's like a whole day, a whole day's work of like at least 6 hours of work kind of diving through the trenches. Yesterday, uh, I used computer use via the Playright MCP within cursor app. So, what I did was I used a Facebook ad scraper. I went to the Facebook ads library and I pulled like 300 different ads for, you know, a certain niche. And once I had those in cursor app, all I did was commanded the playwright MCP to actually navigate to like a certain set of those ads. There were like 25 or 30 of them. And it took screenshots of all the ads. I pulled that into cursor app and I had like visual analysis of like what the elements were in there, like, you know, were there people, were there products, was it lifestyle imagery, stuff like that. And while I was sitting there watching this run, like Playright was opening up my Chrome and looking at these ads, and it was just like, \"Wow, this is a glimpse into the future right here.\" Yeah. Because you could you could take you could create a flow that does that where it analyzes the visual elements of anything, and then you could imagine a quad step where it like where you have it generate uh a JSON of a bunch of GPT image prompts, and you could get 10 thumbnails back based on whatever, whatever is this is a random idea here, but um, those types of workflows are actually how I have been using it. My favorite workflow is a packaging workflow that gives me five options of the uh image like of a thumbnail concept with a title packaging, and it uses a PDF of a hundred of my favorite thumbnails, a lot of them from people like Greg, Diary of a CEO, all my like favorite YouTubers, and it does a really good job of seeing what that style is and converting it to English and then passing it to the GBT image model. I think that is a really good way to to to start for sure in Vibe marketing is to create an ideation workflow. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nSo, uh, that's kind of what we did here. We went through all of these companies, and I took it a step further. I wanted to go and see how they're advertising on Meta. So, went and scraped their active ads from Meta using an Appify tool. So, these are the the links of their ads libraries. So we get an idea around like what ads these companies are running, how they may be addressing or missing a lot of the conversations that are happening out there that you know customers care about, you know. So to me, this is kind of like a gap analysis step. This allows me to find like a targeted wedge into a market that I can develop an angle around. And what I noticed here was a lot of these companies are missing out in terms of getting an app to like production level. That seems to be like what a lot of folks are talking about. I also use Trustpilot to go and scrape all the reviews of these companies. So, you know, people are like common problems, AI gets stuck in infinite loops, I'm spending too much money, they don't have good customer support, um, works for simple projects but fails at others, broken integrations. So, the overall pattern here is that all platforms share similar issues. AI creating bugs and charging to fix them. Poor customer support, billing and refund problems, and working well for simple demos, but failing at production ready applications. So, I mean, that is a pretty solid pattern that we can dig into and start to create some content and some assets around. Now, we know what problems people are having. And part of your marketing philosophy is like, how do I just add as much value as possible? This is a way that we can think about adding value to people. This is also a way we can think about hey, what maybe what features or whatever might people care about as we build.\n\n100% that is an insight as a company. We are in the trenches trying to figure out what the limitations to vibe coding is, then I said, uh, okay, my product VibeCode App helps you build production ready apps from a native iOS app. So I'm a competitor. My philosophy is all around like adding as much value as I can via organic content. I'm Riley Brown. I share this content on X, YouTube, Tik Tok, Instagram. What are the best marketing opportunities to grow my app now knowing what you know? So then what it does is it kind of goes through like all of these various ideas for for a content series and stuff like that around how to address these problems. So, fixing what others break content series, transparent pricing and anti-loops, production ready proof series, community rescue missions, why this fails, competitive comparison content, and then it even gives like hook ideas for short form content, strategic positioning statements or angles around your marketing, ideas for content partnership and SEO play, what you should emphasize as key differentiators against them. So, you know, this is like really cool information, but then the next question is, all right, great. What do I do with it? How do I make this very actionable? This is why I love working in Claude. Once I give it this context, I can access all of Claude's features. Claude can code, it can build things, I can share those things with my team. So, I was like, \"Hey, build a 14-day Vibe Code app organic growth content calendar.\" And I had it uh create an artifact here. This took like a few minutes, I guess. And this plans out 42 different content pieces tied to customer pain points and your unique angle across, you know, four different platforms, X, YouTube, Tik Tok, and Instagram. And it gives you like briefs, hooks, um, formats, and essentially everything that you need to do to to create this type of stuff. That is amazing. So, it it wrote it all out, which seemed kind of like, okay, I now I have to read this essay, but now it puts it in this clean format, which kind of brings in the vibe coding nature of of just how like interfaces are whatever you want them to be now. And wait, can you go back to the calendar view real quick? I I love this. Like, this is this is lovely. And I think um yeah, and you could you literally could ask Claude to change it in any way that you want. Like, can you actually tag it by uh this you can you uh you know, make it match my brand colors, etc., etc. And you could uh you can publish this and send it to your team too and be like absolutely and you know as as creators one of the difficult things I think is like scaling some of these content efforts because you become sort of the bottleneck in a sense. It's hard for others to like nail your voice. They don't really think as deeply about like what people are talking about. You're so in it. It's like in your DNA. So, you know, what's going to like inherently work and engage people in my mind, like being able to pull all of that into one place that is going to give me the chance to get more leverage and kind of escape a little bit from uh that content treadmill and empower my team members with this type of thing is like such a powerful idea for like a Marketing Team. Amazing.\n\nOnce you start like seeing cool stuff, it's like, hey, what else can this do? So I was thinking about other good organic growth strategies, and you know everyone talks about like SEO and AI-driven SEO to show up in LLMs and stuff like that. One of the ways I think about that is like programmatic search strategies. So you know identifying search terms or topics and then building out a number of pages. If someone goes into perplexity or something like that and they say hey like how's VibeCode App different than cursor app or whatever, like I'm there to answer that question. So the cool thing about AI is that you can do that kind of thing at scale. So I had it create sort of like a a comparison page that you know you could essentially take and and publish on your website. Obviously you could like make this tailored to your brand and integrate certain keywords that you want to rank for, but this is all like highly contextual again about what problems people are facing and stuff like that.\n\nOne of the common things that people like say when they're sort of like skeptical of Vibe marketing is like, \"Isn't this just going to create a bunch of AI slop out on the internet?\" Well, that was like phase zero of of this stuff when people were just like going into chat GPT and creating blog posts. Like I think at the end of the day, if content adds value, it doesn't matter if it's created by a human or by AI. I'm there to answer their question. And how I do that is sort of irrelevant. And this type of content is addressing their problems in a very solid way. So, uh, you can do that when you set up these types of workflows and MCPs at scale, which is super, super cool. Very cool.\n\nI'm reading this right now with the target audience. Like, you nailed it. Like, Gen Z wanting to build mobile apps, like people are very mobile first, entrepreneurs with app ideas, but no coding exper Well, the designers who want to bring their iOS concepts to life. Like, I'm reading through this and I'm like, this is pretty solid. It's not just making stuff up. It's and that's one of the reasons why MCP is so cool. It's literally a context protocol. Like it literally allows them to give responses that are relevant to whatever context you're in if you set them up correctly. Because that's one thing you do have to set them up correctly. And that's why I think communities like yours are so valuable like to kind of help people set up things in such a way that they're not like getting false productivity. Yep. Yeah. I mean these are powerful tools. They can give you a lot of leverage and efficiency and you know you get this dopamine rush from like you know creating on them and stuff like that. But yeah, I mean at the end of the day you have to be focused on the things that are actually going to like move your business forward. Like that's why we're you know utilizing these tools and stuff in the first place.\n\nI wanted to ask you a question. Take someone who um maybe they're in your community and they become a Vibe marketer, and I don't know what product they're selling. That's not important for the example. They were at the beginning of 2026. They are now a Vibe marketer. They wake up in the morning, what are they doing? What take me through the morning of a vibe marketer? What is the first thing that they do? What is their mentality like?\n\nYeah. I mean, I think the best thing that I can illustrate that with is maybe an example of of my day a little bit. So, um, you know, when I wake up in the morning, uh, I chug a Celsius and I throw a Zin in, and my mind just starts like rolling with ideas. So I go down and I start like experimenting with new tools, you know, like I'll open up cursor app, I'll open up inade, whatever it is that I'm sort of messing around with that day. So I reserve like a certain amount of time to kind of like experiment and learn. I think like staying at the forefront of what's happening here in an industry like marketing is super key, like MCPs and things like that. If I didn't have this dedicated time to go and like learn these tools, then I wouldn't be able to hop on here and kind of show you these powerful demos. So I spent time learning and experimenting. The other thing, like once you figure out how to learn and experiment and gain leverage from workflows that you actually kind of like push into production so to speak, you can\n\n\nRun a lot more like tests.\nOne test that I ran, I actually vibe coded it um with Replet.\nI built like a template directory for n8n workflows.\nSo I use Manis.\nI had it code up some example templates.\nI threw that into Replet.\nI built a full directory site.\nI linked it up to my Beehive account and I published it in a couple hours.\nAnd to date, I think that simple directory site has gotten me like three or 4 thousand emails of people that are signing up as like a lead magnet.\nYou're able to like act on ideas so quickly and you're able to test and experiment in a really, really fast way.\nIn my past life as a digital marketer, I would have to go on to like Upwork and Fiverr and like all this stuff and find like freelancers and go back and forth and to build that template or directory site and get this test out and try to validate if it actually adds value to my business would have taken me two weeks, you know, and instead now it takes a couple hours.\nSo, I'm able to cycle through these things a lot.\nAnd since I've been doing that on like my content, my lead magnets, my landing pages, stuff like that, like my business has exploded, you know?\nIt's it's crazy.\nFirst of all, I am really happy for you because I've been following your account for 2 years on X and I've just seen like the recent rise in both the community followers engagement and I think I just think you found like this amazing sweet spot with these AI tools and you've done such a good job at being the beacon of signal in this space that was kind of like no code automations before that I thought there's like pretty bad information in and it's honestly like made the space like hard to create content in without people thinking you're like some sort of like course guru type, you know, that that's selling like a BS course.\nI think you've done a really good job of saying, \"Okay, no, no, there's real value here.\nHere is specifically how you can get this real value out of it.\"\nAnd like I want to commend you on that.\nAnd meeting you in person with Greg and and talking about this and seeing like your genuine excitement around Vibe Marketing has made me like now I'm leaning in and now I'm like, \"Oh my god, like this is going to be so useful for our business.\"\nLike I'm doing a startup now and like I I I couldn't be more excited to like create a team of AI agents over time and like it's hard to kind of prioritize what skills to learn.\nOne of my final questions is in terms of like priorities if you were in a startup, if you're in my position like you know we raised some money, we're trying to grow an app pretty fast.\nIt's relatively competitive but like I think we have some distribution advantages.\nWhat do you think we should be prioritizing in this Vibe marketing stack?\nYeah.\nUm, so thinking about sort of like the the landscape out there, you know, after doing a little bit of this research and stuff and perhaps your target audience, I don't know, I see an opportunity for your product to be like the on-ramp to this entire world for a completely new segment like the the younger generation, this whole Gen Z uh generation.\nAnd I think one of your unique talents is breaking all this down in ways that the broader audience can understand it, can learn it, and things like that.\nAnd that's how you built up your audience across channels like Tik Tok and YouTube and Instagram and stuff.\nSo, I'd be looking at ways to sort of tap into maybe like Tik Tok with other like micro and nano influencers.\nI'd probably be starting to experiment with some AI UGC type uh products.\nArc ads is really cool.\nI've been testing that as well.\nI've run a lot of like app acquisition campaigns over the years and I think that there's an opportunity to uh test some like paid campaigns too, especially on like Tik Tok.\nSo, if you create a great video on Tik Tok, it starts to get some traction or go viral, you can use that as like they used to call it a spark ad.\nI haven't run campaigns for a little while, but uh so it it looks like a natural piece of content, but when someone clicks on it, they go to the app store, they download the app.\nSo, I'd be experimenting with a little bit of paid.\nI think that you have a great way to validate like what topics and things work on these channels and then things that do, I'd be either looking for other like micro and nano influencers to dig in on those topics and I'd be putting a little bit of money behind those as well.\nThat's probably like the first thing that that I would be thinking about.\nAmazing.\nWhat was that?\nArc ads.\nI don't even know if I've heard of that yet.\nIs that like um kind of a an ad an ad creator or content creator?\nYeah, it's called Arc Ads and uh essentially what it is is like an AI UGC creation platform specifically for Tik Tok and ads and things like that.\nSo you uh have a script that you bring into the platform and then they've got hundreds of different sort of like AI avatars that you know you can access.\nSo write a good script with a solid hook.\nIt helps you to optimize those things and then and maybe maybe we use uh your your MCP workflow to create some of these uh scripts.\nExactly.\nSo I messaged the founder on X and I was like, \"Hey, I got to start testing uh this API.\nSo he gave me access.\nI'm starting to like build some workflows around scaling up like organic and paid Tik Tok creative with Arcad.\"\nSo I'm excited to to talk more about that.\nAnd who knows, maybe we'll maybe we can run it as a test and uh I'll generate some content for for VibeCode App.\nHell yeah, bro.\nUm this is awesome.\nI I think this is a really good kind of intro into this world of Vibe Marketing and I hope I genuinely hope to have you back on soon.\nI'm sure you guys are cooking up something pretty cool over there and every couple months, new models, new video models, new avatar models are going to change everything.\nSo I I I look forward to having you back on.\nThanks for having me.\nThis was a lot of fun.\nAppreciate it, Riley.\n",
