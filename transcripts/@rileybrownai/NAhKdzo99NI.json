  "cleanText": "Thanks to N8n, the fastest growing AI tool, people like me with no coding experience can build AI agent workflows that can replace entire teams, all without writing a single line of code. But more than that, you can also create custom interfaces for those agentic workflows, and you can sell them to businesses, or you can use them to grow yours. This video is the most complete guide to N8n and creating AI agents without writing a single line of code, and also how to turn these N8n workflows into your own customized Vibe-Coded Agentic Applications. In this video, we're going to cover it all. We're going to first talk about the great agentic opportunity and how software is changing. We're then going to talk about the four most important things to understand with N8n. We're going to do an initial setup of an N8n workflow and go through the basics. We're also going to talk about the built-in tools, APIs, and HTTP requests. Then, we're going to dive into some more detail with AI Agents and go through a lot of examples. We're also going to talk about a better interface for AI Agents. Then, we're going to put it all together. And at the end, we're going to show you our full examples of our Vibe-Coded Agentic Applications. And we're going to show you our master chief marketing officer that is an AI agent that has access to AI Agents. And then at the end, we're going to talk about how Vibe-Coded Agentic Applications are going to get better as the years go on. And finally, we're going to talk about templates that you can download that will help you get started much faster. If videos like these excite you, we're going to be doing these basically every single day for the next 10 years straight. So, make sure to hit the subscribe and like button. Let's dive into the video.\n\nBefore we dive into N8n, I want to talk about the opportunity that is in front of us. Literally, the length of tasks that AI can do is doubling every 7 months. And so we are seeing correctly, we are seeing a rapid growth in popularity of N8n, which is the first tool ever to allow people who've never written a line of code like me. I know you're very technical, and so it's actually easier for you to pick it up. But people like me, we can build agentic workflows because it is the first visual builder of AI Agents. And as you can see here, N8n is actually more, I don't know how this is even possible, becoming more popular than the term AI Agents. Yeah. And I think part of the reason is there's a lot of people on YouTube who are shilling N8n as a way of making money. They're selling these templates, doing all these things, and it feels like there's some sort of scam going on, and I can't speak to those creators, but that doesn't mean that N8n is super powerful. It is incredibly powerful. So at my previous startup that I founded, I had to make my own AI agent, and I can tell you how it went. Eight hours of coding minimum just to get like the bare bones, just basic agent, and you need a lot of experience to know it. You can't just go ahead and start typing it up, or you can't even vibe code it. It would take too long. And yeah, and if you wanted to add any features, you got to spend another eight hours fixing that, trying to make it work. And that's just the back end. This has no like interaction with the front end. This is just how the AI works, and nothing works. And you'll probably look something like that right towards the end. And that's how I looked. I think I was actually blowing steam out of my nose. Yeah, exactly. Um, but since like the past two weeks we've been working on N8n, it's been glorious. 20 minutes just to get the agent set up. You can start immediately. You need no years of experience. You can start, and they have a bunch of tools and things you can add to it that we'll explain later to make it just as powerful. One thing I will add is like it is a little bit intimidating at first because there's a lot of inputs and outputs. Right? There's some coding adjacent things you need to understand, like JSON is is useful to understand how uh different AI models can output in different formats, I feel like is a really important thing, and then just having like a general understanding of software is useful. Yeah. But yeah, basically anyone who's just like interested in technology can learn it, and we'll go over that today, and we're going over you just do it maybe two or three times. We'll show you how to do it, and then you got it. It's super simple, and you'll look something like that. Amazing. You'll be happy. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSo, we're going to talk about a lot of things today. N8n has a lot of different features, but the four most important things that we need to understand. What what are these four biggest things that we really need to understand about N8n? The first thing you should understand is the workflow. So, this entire thing right here is a workflow. And every workflow has actions. And so, they have it's like a sequence of actions. A sequence of actions. And every workflow starts with a trigger. Every workflow starts with a trigger. And then from there it hits those actions. In this case, we're just using a schedule trigger. So it just triggers every 15 minutes, and then it goes through the sequence of actions in which this case this workflow just takes a file from my Dropbox, adds some captions, and then returns it in my Dropbox. Yeah. And so basically every period of time, in this case, you have it set for 15 minutes. That's if you want to use AI to like actually make decisions. Yeah. So the third most important thing to understand about N8n is their new node AI Agents. And if you can see here, it's not linear at all. It has a trigger, of course. But then you can see here that the AI agent has different tools, which are essentially actions that you saw before that the AI agent chooses when to use if necessary. So that's the key difference, right? Linear workflows, those are actions, right? But AI Agents, these are kind of like tools they can use if it basically needs to, right? You have it's like a super smart AI model that can decide when to use the tools. That's the key distinction. So the difference, yeah, for example, the difference here is it'll it'll always get the files in my Dropbox in this linear workflow. In this AI agent workflow, maybe it doesn't need to use a Slack, but we have it here just in case we need it, right? And so that brings us to our fourth most important thing about N8n is these new interfaces that people are making to connect these AI Agents with them. And so I have one set up right here. We'll go over how to make all of this in just a second. But I'll go ahead and show you how it works. So we'll just go ahead and send this message saying tell Riley I like his studio and to make a new calendar event for a meeting I have. We'll go ahead and send that. And then you can see, wow, the app triggered the workflow that's now using an AI agent that has access to tools. Yeah. Amazing. And so it sent me a message on Slack. Yeah. And then it's going to ideally schedule an appointment. So it added something to the to-do list, which is very cool. Yeah. And that's exactly what I wanted. And then so it sent you a Slack message. One of the things that can happen is things can fail. As you can see here, the whenever you have a web hook trigger, uh, basically the AI agent's going to respond back to that web hook. And it actually wasn't able to schedule the appointment. It was able to send me a message, but it wasn't able to schedule the appointment. And so the AI agent realized that and sent that back through the web hook. So the VAAP actually, so now when you're using this Vibe-Coded Agentic Application, which we'll talk about later, you actually know exactly what went wrong. And one key part of N8n, right, if there was a the fifth thing that you really need to understand is you need to understand how to fix problems when they go wrong, cuz let's let's figure this out. Yeah. So if we open the calendar, it says forbidden. Perhaps check your credentials. So he didn't set up credentials. We're going to talk about credentials a little bit later. He chose the wrong account. Yeah. Um and I don't know if you I think I probably mislabeled it or something, right? And it happens. And it happens. And so the key is once you set this up correctly the first time, you then have access to these AI Agents. So it's very important that you are very detail oriented when you're first setting these up so that at any time you can use an AI agent that has access to all these different tools. And I think that's a benefit of AI Agents is that it'll tell you exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. Whereas if it was a linear workflow like this, it would just silently fail and you wouldn't really get any feedback on what what failed and how. Amazing. Okay, let's actually build one of these workflows. And so anytime that you use N8n, it just it looks like this. Yeah, this is how it looks. It's a canvas that's blank. And your first step will be those trigger nodes that we talked about. And they have a bunch of them. They have, you know, if you send something to Notion or Telegram, it'll automatically trigger. You can do web hooks, which we'll talk about, but for now, we'll just do a schedule one. So, let's set this trigger to trigger every 15 minutes. So, every 15 minutes, what do we want it to do? So every 15 minutes, um what we can do is let's do that uh workflow that you showed with the Dropbox. Awesome. So let's see what happens next. Do action and app. And they have over 400 different applications with their integration. They have a bunch of them and you can search for your own. I'll just search for Dropbox. Very cool. And then we will list a folder. List a folder. Yeah. I don't I wouldn't know what that me means honestly. Um, well, if you go here, it says return the files and folders in a given folder. Oh, it lists the files within a folder. Got it. Yeah, got it. And so, we'll do that. And we can return all of the files. And the folder path is I have Dropbox open right here. It's just raw for like raw videos. So, we'll just put raw here. Raw. That's the name of it. That's the name of the folder. Okay. So, whatever you name the folder, but if that's a subfolder within your thing, it's going to be a different path. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it'll be a different path. And then say it was like raw and then in that folder there was another one that said videos. You just add another slash and it'd be videos. Yes. And if you get confused, just ask chat GPT. It'll always tell you. You can ask chat GPT also. Yeah. Raw. And then each input area has like this little question mark that you can hover over and it'll tell you the path of which to list the content. Amazing. Awesome. And then also another resource is this AI tool that N8n has built in. they can actually read your workflow and give you feedback on it. Amazing. Awesome. So, after we list the Dropbox folders, go ahead and get the video that we want. So, if it finds a video, it'll get that video. And let's see if it can download a file. Awesome. Download file path. And this is where things get interesting. instead of just putting like a set file path or folder path like you just saw me like I could do raw but the file name could always be different. It will always be different. It will always be different. So we don't want to do that. So what we want to do is use the output the result of the previous Dropbox. So when it lists all the files we want to use whatever it lists into this file path. Absolutely. Actually go back go back to the the list here. So, so one of the things to understand with any workflow builder, can you go to the just the out? So, like as you see, there's a trigger. Every 15 minutes, it's going to look in a folder and it's going to get a list, right? It is basically going to pull a list of um of files, all of which will have an ID of some kind. Yeah. And that's one thing you need to train your brain as you use N8n. You need to start thinking about what are the inputs and the outputs of each one. Right. Once you train your brain to always think that, then you'll always realize that you need to correctly connect the output of the previous action into the input of the current action. Yeah. And here uh every single time it's going to be different because the end result of this will move those files out of this. So every single time it's going to be new. So it needs to be dynamic. So each one is kind of like a variable. So if it finds a list of folders, each one will have a new number. We're using all those numbers in the flow anyway. Yeah. And so in order to do that, if you look on the left side of when you open a node or an action, you will have these variables here. And so what we want to look for is name. And so you can just drag the name just into there. And now you'll see the little brackets around it. And that means it's dynamic. It'll change every time. Yeah. And it's an expression. And then what do we want that file name to be inside of N8n? We'll just say video because that just makes things simpler. And let's rename this action node so we can keep track. That's great. All right. Now, how are we going to add captions to our video? I don't know. You're telling me. Yeah. We're going to use a service called uh ZapCap. And I'm sure maybe some of you have heard of it. And I just wanted to show you this is because we can connect any API to N8n. And so this is not a built-in integration, is it? No. And by built-in integration, right, like you want to add in another action. Obviously, there's hundreds of these, but they're not always there. Not all of them are there. There's unlimited actions that you could uh create with all of the tools on the internet. And that's thanks to the HTTP request, which is one that I I need I need you to like kind of help me on this because these are the harder ones to set up. So yeah, let's explain what an HTTP request is and like what even is an API. The way I think of it is an HTTP is like the common language that is spoken between different software and machines over the internet. This is a customer service bot, okay? Um, they're not Open AI\n\n\n, but they use Open AI to make their bots, right?\nAnd so, let's say a customer comes in with a request.\nMaybe he wants some help with something.\nHe's shopping.\nSomething broke.\nOkay, he comes in with that request.\nThis customer service bot looks at the request and he's like, \"Oo, I need to talk to Open AI about this.\"\nBut Open AI doesn't know this has happened yet.\nSo, he's chilling.\nHe doesn't know what's happening.\nSo yeah, he sends a request over to OpenAI with everything that he knows and then Open AI has this link right here and that's where this information would be sent.\nAmazing.\nYeah.\nAnd so basically so there's just one way of saying like hey I need information and then on the way back it's just like here's the information that you need and sometimes there's a charge associated with that.\nOpen AI, that's how OpenAI makes a lot of their money is they charge people for these requests for these requests.\nAnd in the case of N8n, for all the built-in integrations, it has an open router integration, right?\nIt basically just sets up the HTTP requests for you so that you don't have to do this.\nYeah.\nBut if you want to actually build agents, build workflows that are unique and useful, something that people would pay for and you and like you don't want to be limited by the built-in integrations, you have to be able to build your own HTTP requests and set it up so that you can use any external.\nExactly.\nYeah.\nSo, and and will usually set this um conversation up for you.\nUm in which case they don't.\nYeah.\nWe would have to set this up on our own.\nAnd it's also it's very simple.\nOnce you just do one or two, you got it.\nYeah.\nUm and so yeah, so let's basically go over exactly how this works.\nSo let's say again customer server spot send something to OpenAI start, right?\nAnd the first thing that happens is is the a API endpoint um even there?\nIs it even real?\nIs this right here?\nRight?\nSo let's say it's mistyped or it's old or doesn't exist anymore.\nThis thing will shoot its shot completely miss and it'll return like yeah return error endpoint not available and usually you get that 404 error that everyone has seen when they've been onto like a page that didn't.\nIf it succeeds it sends the HTTP request and then that reaches open AI and then it goes in through another step.\nWhat type of HTTP request?\nSo there's four main ones, but usually you'll only use two, which would be get and post.\nAnd we'll explain that.\nAnd they're pretty simple.\nOne method is get, which is just retrieving data from the uh it's just retrieving data.\nSo that would just be like getting information back.\nSo what that would look like is Open AI would just send information back.\nAnd so if if OpenAI generates something that is a get like like if in the case of the the um customer service bot in the case of the customer service bot it would send information to Open AI and then they both receive information and so that would be a post where it sends data and so you can think of posts as get and put which put would just be putting data into Open AI and then Open AI wouldn't send any data it back.\nGot it.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nAnd then the next one is delete, which would probably wouldn't happen in this scenario, but you would just delete something from OpenAI.\nMakes sense.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nAnd so, so get means retrieve, post means send.\nYeah.\nPut means update a field.\nAnd then delete means remove data.\nYeah.\nSo the method right here be delete, get, and you don't got to worry about.\nAnd what are we doing on this step?\nSo the first step we would be sending the video to Zapcap and then getting the ID of their upload back.\nSo what are we putting here for that?\nWe're using post.\nWe're using both getting and receiving information.\nAmazing.\nYeah.\nAnd so what happens after that?\nIs the request successful?\nDo you have, you know, proper authorization?\nAre you allowed to make that request?\nUm did the request go through or was there an error?\num if it's no then it will fail and then if if in the case of N8n if it is no then the the actions are done you're not going to be able to keep moving along right and so that's why it's so important to make sure that things are successful and they are robust in a sense they are um able to take in multiple files right because if it tries to get a file and then it ends up being a image right then like is it everything going to fail or like that these are all the things that you need to think about because as soon as one step fails like the whole chain is done.\nYeah.\nAnd so you got to make sure everything is set up.\nYeah.\nAnd you can sort of handle errors sometimes, but in the case of N8n, it usually won't work.\nAnd that's how you get, you know, an error of 500 or something about that that you may see.\nAnd that's that's actually what makes agents so interesting is because like if you've used agents on N8n, it one of the HTTP requests could fail and then it might actually try another method, which is super cool.\nit ends up um so because like just like you and I like if we're setting up our presentation and we fail we don't just say like error and then quit we just try something else and so agents are beginning to do that which is super cool.\nYeah.\nAnd you can also set something up where like if it fails you can make it search the web and find an answer and then try again and that's what makes it agentic.\nSo what happens when it succeeds?\nIf it succeeds, receive response with data and you would process the response and then you usually get 200.\nUm, which is like a code that you get, which is okay.\nSo, you want 200, you don't want 400.\nYeah.\nYou don't want four or five, you want two.\nAmazing.\nAnd so, actually, if you go into that workflow, go back to the HTTP request, there's going to be an output, right?\nOn the left side of these settings, you have the input and the right side, you have the output.\nThat's what you're sending to the next note.\nAnd it's important to set these up correctly.\nSo yeah, let's set up our first HTTP request.\nSo our method is post because we're both getting and receiving information.\nAnd the URL is that endpoint that we talked about.\nSo in this case, API super cool service.\nZapcap's case, let's go over to their docs.\nTheir URL would be https/ API.\nAll right, so the first thing that we need is the URL and the endpoint.\nGoing back to the diagram, uh it is this thing right here, the endpoint.\nThis endpoint like where where do we find this endoint?\nIn our case using zap cap, we're just going to search up zip zap cap docs, but you could do that for anything.\nSo you can so like no matter what step we are setting up.\nSo let's say we were setting up access to perplexity, which I don't think they have a tool within N8n, we would look up perplexity docs or documentation and there we will find this magical endpoint link.\nSo you'll find the post and then the endpoint link.\nAnd in this case, it looks like that.\nAnd so we'll go over.\nSo we'll get that URL and then we'll go back to N8n and just paste that there.\nOkay, perfect.\nCool.\nAuthentication.\nLet's go back to the docs.\nSo in order to use this URL, we're going to need to give in some sort of password because we do have to pay for these tools most of the time, right?\nThere's some open APIs that you can use up to a certain amount for free, you know?\nUm but there most of the good ones are ones you have to pay for.\nYeah.\nAnd so we need to like set up some sort of account here.\nYeah.\nSo yeah, you will sign up for an account and then you'll get what's called an API key which is just a randomized, you know, numbers and letters.\nThat's your password like the the little the auto passwords Apple sets up for you.\nYeah.\nThose annoying things.\nYes.\nUm and so here you need an API key.\nAnd so we'll just Google Zapcap API key and you'll get one.\nZapcap API.\nSo when you hear API key, just think unique password that you need to keep secret.\nDo not share it with anyone because then someone else could use all your credits in whatever tool it is.\nYeah.\nSo here in the docs, you'll see you can get your API key from ZapCap dashboard.\nRight.\nSo we'll go ahead over there.\nI already have an account.\nYou just sign up.\nAnd here's your API key.\nAmazing.\nYou don't need to view it.\nYou can just copy.\nCopy that.\nYeah.\nAnd then we'll go over back to N8n and authentication.\nWe'll just go.\nIt's a generic type.\nGo into headers.\nYeah.\nSo, I already set up Zapcap, but in case you have it, um I can show you how to do that.\nSo, we'll just create a new credential.\nAnd you can call it Zapcap 2.\nYeah, we'll just call that Zapcap 2.\nAnd so, um, basically it would be really annoying if all of the time, every single time you set up one with Zapcap, you had to go and get copy your API key and paste it back in.\nA credential is basically a saved password uh and or API key with a certain name so you can use it at any time.\nSo, you definitely want to label those.\nAnd so, we'll call it like what?\nZapcap.\nUh, we just call it Zapcap 2.\nthis name right here.\nWe can go back to the docs cuz that is also important.\nWe have to name it right here.\nYou have to name it X uh- API- key.\nOh, you have to name it exactly.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nAnd that's what it expects.\nSo, um Zapcap will be looking for the name that looks like that and then a valid API key.\nSo, we'll make sure that is exactly how it looks.\nSo that would be X dash API- key.\nAnd then that API key you can just paste in right there.\nCool.\nAnd then we'll hit save.\nNow you're all set up.\nAnd now when you're in here, it automatically loads.\nAnd now anytime you're setting up Zapcap, um, not only can you save this entire node, right, you can actually copy and paste this entire node and use it later.\nIf you ever want to use Zapcap, you just look for it under header off.\nYeah.\nRight.\nCool.\nAwesome.\nAnd now we have to send information to Zapcap.\nSo in this case, we'll be sending the video.\nSo we're going to send a body.\nOkay.\nAnd let's see what it expects.\nSo it expects a multi-art form data.\nWe'll go back.\nInstead of JSON, we have form data.\nAnd if you remember back to when we downloaded the video, we just named it video.\nAmazing.\nSo we'll just go video as the name and the value is also video.\nSo it's always going to be named video.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo you can just put that in deterministically.\nThat makes sense.\nAnd then we'll rename this to send video to zap cap.\nGreat.\nAwesome.\nNow let's see if we got everything.\nYeah, we got everything.\nCool.\nIs there any way at this point we could test this?\nYeah.\nSo we can upload a file to Dropbox, test it out, and see if it sends a video to Zapcap.\nBut it triggers every 15 minutes.\nIt also isn't scheduled for 15 minutes, but once I flick this to activate in production, it will.\nOkay, we'll get to that later.\nOkay.\nOkay, this is good.\nAwesome.\nSo, let's drop a video in here.\nSo, this is the folder it will always be looking at.\nAnd so, it's very important to just keep testing things.\nSo, we're uploading a video and and raw.\nSo now when you hit test it searches and there's an error.\nIt failed on download workflow.\nThat's okay, right?\nThat's going to happen.\nAnd so let's talk let's dig in.\nLet's talk about this.\nSo why did it fail?\nOkay, let's see what it said.\nPlease check your parameters.\nError in call files download match pattern.\nLet's check the error from Dropbox.\nerror in call to API function file download did not match.\nSo I think I see what the problem is.\nUm so N8n tried downloading a video from just video playback.mpp4 but video playback.mpp4 is in folder raw.\nAnd so if you look here this other variable called path lower has raw/v video playback.\nI see.\nAnd so let's remove this.\nAnd we can just drag and drop this one in here.\nAnd so now Dropbox will look for um video playback in the folder raw.\nGot it.\nOkay.\nSo let's go ahead and test that again.\nYep.\nOkay.\nNow it's sending to ver.\nSo now there's another error.\nThat's okay.\nLet's go ahead and look at it.\nAnd remember, let's say you have no uh technical experience.\nGo ahead and copy that real quick.\nThe request.\nYeah, just yeah, copy that whole thing.\nAnd then what I would do is you can open up chat GBT at any time.\nObviously, you could ask um N8n, but you can just paste that in here and I or you could literally give no prompt and it'll it'll still understand what you're doing.\nlike it'll be like um bad request um um attach an actual file stream.\nSo it's not actually a file stream.\nNo.\nOkay.\nUm and now let's say you don't understand that.\nSay can you please expl that this is an N8n workflow.\nUh can you please explain this in simple terms if I don't understand this?\nAnd you can do this all the time.\nLike if you're not doing this all the time, you're not pushing yourself enough in whatever it is that you're doing.\nLike I do this 20 times a day because I'm always trying to figure out some new thing um to make my workflows better.\nAnd so here it's like in an um use node read binary file.\nAh is that the issue?\nThat is the issue.\nIt it's expecting the string.\nIt's expecting um the text video instead.\nWe want it to upload the file.\nOkay.\nname video, not just the words video.\nSo, we'll go over to parameter type and instead of just form data, which is basically just words, we'll do N8n binary file, which would be um the actual video file.\nAnd so, we can just name this video.\nLet's test it again.\nSo, we can test the full workflow again.\nTest workflow.\nTrigger files, video, send video to Zapcap.\nYay.\nSuccess.\nSuccess.\nOkay.\nNow, where is it?\nWe don't have it.\nWe don't have it.\nLet's go ahead and let's keep going in the docs.\nAmazing.\nYeah, that's So, we went down option A.\nNow, let's go to step two.\n\n\nGet available templates.\nUm, and so Zapcap just has different templates for like different types of captions that you want that you might want to have in your video.\nSo, this is actually a really hard workflow.\nUm, you want to show them the one that you made?\nLike, show them how long it is.\nYeah.\nLike, so it's actually really long, but we actually we we started with a really hard workflow on purpose because what we want to show you is the fact that everything in N and one of the reasons it's gone so popular is uh influencers are actually selling workflows.\nLuckily for you, we're just giving everything away for free.\nYou can copy and paste everything.\nSo in the description, you can find a link to this page.\nYeah.\nAnd this is uh we have four templates here.\nUm we'll add more.\nUm and we're going to organize them.\nWe're going to give them tags.\nWe're going to organize them depending on why you might want to use them.\nBut here we have this audio video or auto video caption which uses Zapcap.\nYeah.\nAnd then so you just go over here.\nIt's actually just one long JSON.\nUm but you'll just go ahead and copy that.\nAnd so every template within N is just a JSON.\nSo like if you go back to N, this node-based system is basically just a wrapper on a JSON, right?\nIt JSON.\nIf you don't know what JSON is, it's just this like formatting uh text in a way that makes sense in computers.\nIf that's not technically true, screw you.\nI'm using that definition.\nAnd so um and go and so what you can copy, you can literally select and copy it.\nDon't do that because we already copied the other one.\nYou can paste the whole flow right here.\nYeah.\nSo let's just command V.\nYep.\nBoom.\nWe have the entire flow that was um from the other page as well.\nBut yeah, just copy the JSON, command V, and it's all here.\nSo now you have that entire flow and you can create it.\nNow, since we're kind of going over all of these individual nodes, you can go in and customize them.\nYeah.\nUh you can make sure that the credentials are set up correctly for your own account, but we have this uh workflow that should work out of the box, right?\nYeah.\nYeah, it will.\nAnd if you wanted to um maybe instead of sending it to Dropbox, maybe send it to your Discord channel or Telegram, you can you can just edit this.\nAnd so you want to go ahead and uh you want to see if we can test these?\nYeah.\nSo we still have that video in our Dropbox.\nBut is it going to be the same folder since you copied it?\nIt'll be the same folder.\nOh, wow.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nUm Yeah.\nSo let's go ahead and test it.\nAnd so it gets the folder, the file, and it sends it to Zapcap.\nAnd I think one of the reasons why we went through each individual node before this and talked about the docs is like you may still need some of that information if you want to veer off in any direction.\nYeah.\nRight.\nAnd you can always use AI.\nYou can always copy the docs for Zapcap and ask questions and figure out how to do it.\nAnd you can even ask for the JSON the same way you just copied our template.\nYou can ask AI to generate the JSON and it will actually generate sometimes it'll be 98% right.\nUm we want to get it to 100.\nIt would be really cool if it was 100% correct every time.\nI think that would be a lot more fun, a lot easier for most people.\nYeah.\nUm and then this step is literally wait one minute.\nOne minute as we wait for Zapcap to finish up.\nOkay, cool.\nUm yeah, and then it's just going to use get, if you remember that, to get the video.\nAmazing.\nSo, it's done getting the video.\nAll right.\nSo, now it's downloading some file.\nOkay.\nNow, it's uploading it back into the Dropbox, but it's a different folder this time.\nYeah, it's a different folder.\nGot it.\nOkay.\nSo, and so if anyone else downloads this template, they're going to need to specify their own Dropbox folder.\nUm, and so they they might name it something else.\nYeah.\nSo you'd have a kind of a a pre-edited folder and then post-edited folder.\nYou can name them that as well.\nOkay.\nSo workflow executed successfully.\nDo you want to check?\nYeah, let's go ahead and check that.\nSo this is the upload folder.\nAnd now the download folder.\nWe have a new one.\nI named it just W.\nW.\nLet's play it.\nAnd that's a 20-year-old video that just got automated.\nYeah, we get the point.\nAmazing.\nOkay, so this is a workflow and you can just download this template and now what you can do is you could actually make this whole thing a tool and give it access to an agent in theory, right?\nLike this could be one tool.\nYeah, that could be one tool.\nSo as we transition, right?\nSo this is a linear workflow and like what did we learn?\nLet's think about what we learned for this.\nLike throughout this process, we learned what an HTTP request is.\nYeah.\nAnd if you're struggling through HTTP requests, I struggled with it for a week or more.\nIt just takes some time to understand, but like we went over the basic parts of it.\nWe did a really hard example, but what's cool is that there's templates all over the internet that you can find that allows you to just copy and paste them directly in on top of ours.\nRight?\nI'm not suggesting you need our template database by any means, right?\nThere's actually whole GitHub repos.\nAnd we'll also paste that below.\nUh, two massive N templates that you can find on the internet.\nAnd you do not need to pay for anyone's N templates.\nThat's just an insane thing to do.\nThey It's free on the internet.\nThis only works, right?\nThis will only work while you're testing it until you publish it.\nYeah.\nHere you Now we published it.\nNow it'll work every every 15 minutes.\nIt'll check your Dropbox.\nSo, if you have 20 shorts that you're done with for the day, you can drag all of them into Dropbox and they will all be triggered, right?\nAmazing.\nBut now I think it's time to bring in the AI Agents.\nSo, this is what an N AI agent would look like.\nUm, so compared to the linear flow, it's not linear.\nThis is more three-dimensional, two-dimensional, whatever.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd I always think of these these little little things sticking out of the agent, you know, they they're not they're no longer nodes in a path, right?\nThey're no longer steps in a path.\nThey are they are optional tools that can be used except for the model.\nSo like before we need a trigger node, right?\nUm in this case, we'll use web hooks and we'll get into that in a bit on how we can integrate that further on, but let's just start off with a web hook.\nBoom.\nWe'll work on that later.\nNow, let's bring in the AI Agents.\nAnd just know that this web hook is basically just going to send in text.\nAnd we're going to show you exactly how this is, but the web hook is super magical because it allows you to hook up your whole entire flow, which will include the agent into an external app of your choice.\nYeah, you can vibe code an app and have it communicate with this AI agent workflow.\nAnd we we'll get to that in a second, but let's move to the agent first.\nYeah.\nSo I went ahead and added an agent.\nAnd so this is the screen you'll be brought up into.\nSource for prompt.\nSo there's a source for prompt.\nAnd then you're also going to add a system prompt.\nWhat are those two?\nSo inside the AI agent, there's two different prompts that you can use.\nSo there's the user prompt and system message.\nThe user prompt would be something like, what's on my calendar today?\nCan you do this?\nCan you do that?\nAnd this is going to be what comes in through the web hook.\nWhatever we send into it, this it would go right here and that's what the user message is.\nThe system message is just for the AI agent.\nIt's and it's going to stake the same.\nYeah, that is all the same.\nSo, yeah.\nSo, the user message would change every time.\nSystem message, that's what it gets hit with all the time.\nAnd that's the same thing if you were setting up a chat GPT uh custom GPT or a clawed project.\nYou set the system instructions, right?\nThis is the it gives it kind of grounds it in the right context or it tells it exactly what it's going to do every time to make it more predictable.\nAnd with agents, I would say with agents, the system instructions is actually much more important because if you give it access to a bunch of tools and you don't specify what you want the agent to do with it, you're going to be in a world of hurt.\nYeah.\nYou basically want to put it in the right headsp space if that makes sense.\nYou're going to give it like, you know, maybe you can even give it a title.\nYou are a master designer.\nIn this case, you are an idea generator.\nYou have the abilities to XYZ and those abilities would be the tools.\nSo in this case, you know, you have the ability to read Notion\num and use buffer which we'll get into later.\nUm and it's also if you run into like any errors, you can be like important.\nWe're not using a chat trigger node.\nWe're using a web hook.\nSo we'll define below.\nWe can also just like set like for for testing this is important.\nYou can be like hi and this is just like the user message.\nYou could be like, you know, whatever you want.\nWhatever you want.\nAnd so you can actually have two different triggers, right?\nA web hook would be coming in from your own external tool or you could set up another trigger that would be like um chat.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOn a chat input field.\nAnd so this allows you to like really test it within this app because if you once you connect this, right, you can connect this in and then there's going to be the option to open up a chat interface at some point.\nOh yeah.\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSo yeah, open chat and then we can say hello send.\nNothing's going to happen probably because we haven't set up.\nYeah, we haven't set up the agent.\nYeah, one of the predefined options is connect uh with the chat trigger node which we just set up.\nYeah.\nSo, and it has no Oh, yeah.\nI guess it would it respond or do we have to give it an AI model?\nWe have to give it an AI model.\nSo, um, in the chat model, it'll open up this menu and there's a bunch of different, um, providers to choose from.\nAnd then for the model, we'll just use Cloud Sonnet 4.\nThat's the best agentic model out right now.\nUm, so at this point, I think the AI agent could actually just respond to a simple how are you doing?\nRight.\nThis is an agent, but it just doesn't have any access access to any tools.\nYeah.\nSo, it should just respond, right?\nCL responded with what did it say?\nI'm doing well.\nThanks for asking.\nIt responded, but like it's not interesting because it doesn't have access to anything.\nYeah.\nRight.\nSo what we could do is we could actually give it access to other things.\nYeah.\nAnd so there's a bunch of different tools that you could choose.\nUm and so let's go ahead and give it access to Notion because that's where we keep all of our content.\nSo on Notion, I use Notion now specifically for AI Agents because it's Notion has a really good for whatever reason their builtin features that allows agents or AIs to basically index their their databases.\nIt makes it easy to find things that it just gives really good context to the AI agent.\nYeah, let's go ahead and do that.\nYeah, let's go ahead.\nAnd what do you want it to give access to in Notion?\nSo I will give it access to let's give it access to a database right a database for those of you who use Notion that's basically a list of database entries or wait can you click on that database thing again it's a list of pages and so we're giving it access to all of the pages within the database and I have a specific one which we can find here um we wanted to get a database we'll get a specific database and I think we can choose it from a list here it should be the one like if you just type in SOP, it should have one that's called how to create content SOPs.\nThis is how I create all my content, right?\nAnd so now we should be good to go.\nWe could ask the AI agent something right now.\nWe could say how what are five long form hooks I could use when explaining AI agents and how they're going to change the world.\nAnd so go ahead and run this.\nAnd so what it's going to do now is it won't just run the chat thing and say check mark and then respond.\nIt is actually going to go to the Notion node think.\nOkay.\nWhy didn't it go to the Notion node?\nBecause we didn't set up the instructions to tell it, right?\nAnd so the reason why we did this to is to illustrate the fact that if you don't set up your instructions, your AI agent is going to operate in an unpredictable way.\nBut now if we give the agent good instructions and we say that it has access to my content then it will use the tool because it never used the Notion tool.\nAnd that is the key distinction.\nIn the last example we showed you a linear workflow where things happen automatically.\nNow they happen optionally but you need to make sure the agent knows what it has access to.\nOkay.\nSo you are a helpful assistant.\nUm your job is to make the best content.\nYou have access to a bunch of Notion tools that will assist you in making content.\nAnytime you are asked to be to write content, you need to look for either short form hooks or long form hooks or good tweets.\nThese are all pages in the Notion database that you'll have access to to use as examples for your style and tone.\nYeah, that's good.\nSo, let's exit out of this.\nNow, what we should do is we should probably give it access to some more Notion pages, more Notion tools.\nThey have a bunch of different p um different tools that the AI agent can use.\nSo, let's let it get many pages in a database.\nGreat.\nUm from the same content SOP,\nI want to Yeah, same one.\nReturn all and let's just keep it how it is.\nNow let's add more Notion.\nLet's see.\nYeah, let's let it search and let's let it choose its own search.\nUm yeah, we'll let it search.\nAnd then um what you can say is so now you're giving it freedom to search through all this whole team space which I think is like a 100 databases.\nAnd let's go back to the system\n\n\nprompt here.\nI always wanted to start off with content SOPs.\nSo let's spec just go into, uh, make a new paragraph at the bottom and say, when asked to create content, just use the, uh, creating content SOPs page that you have access to with a tool or like that you have access to, but if asked a more open question, you may search the database for help.\nYeah, that's good.\nOkay, awesome.\nUm, yeah, let's let it search.\nAnd then this little button right here lets the AI put in its own search text.\nThis is how cool it is.\nAs AI Agents get smarter, AI Agents can just put it in like they can use these tools.\nThe AI will decide what to put in here.\nYeah.\nSo, we're giving it access to this massive database and we're giving it the ability to search, and so that means we're giving it some level of autonomy and it can go out and just search through it.\nIt can decide what search text, right?\nThe search text is not going to be deterministic.\nIt will decide what it wants to search, which is so cool.\nYeah.\nSo now we actually need to add another tool, which is get block, which is basically the things beneath the page or whatever's in the page, right?\nAnd and we can make this AI.\nAI can decide.\nYeah.\nUm, so you want to just select?\nYeah.\nWe'll just let the AI choose the URL.\nYeah.\nAnd then, um, yeah.\nReturn all.\nAwesome.\nNow, let's go ahead and try and get short form hooks because I have a list of 60 or probably like 40 of them that have been very high performing in previous videos of mine.\nAnd if we tell it to get short form hooks, it should just do that.\nAwesome.\nYou want me to read them?\nYeah.\nWhat was the first one?\nToday I realized that AI Agents aren't just fancy chat bots anymore.\nThey're digital employees that work 24/7 without breaks.\nYeah.\nAnd so here, go ahead and open up the link that I just texted you.\nYeah.\nSo, if you open the link that I just texted you, what it had access to was this right here.\nAnd you notice today I realized that.\nYeah.\nAnd that's the one that it used.\nWhat was the next one that it used?\nYou're not going to believe what I just found about AI Agents.\nSo, if you do command F, you're not going to believe, right?\nYou're not going to believe what I just did slash found out.\nSo now here like you can decide what is high quality and then you can say before an AI Agent does something like creating content script, it will look at a bunch of good examples so you know that you're going to get at least something that's like pretty good.\nAI is going to have context over what you think is high quality, which I think there's one thing you could take away from this video when it comes to AI Agents is context is king.\nAnd this is a really great way to do it is to give it access to your database, whether it's Docs, Google Docs, Notion.\nIn this example, we're just using Notion.\nUm, but giving context is king.\nSo, we just made this agent.\nUm, and you know, here are some things that you might need to know when you're making one.\nUm, if you remember, we ran into a few hiccups, um, and little errors.\nUm, so let's go ahead go to executions and we can see past executions.\nEvery single time that you use the agent, it create it's it's an execution.\nYeah.\nGot it.\nYeah.\nAnd then you can go back in time and see the successes or the errors.\nAnd some of the successes can be errors because it success just means it finished.\nYeah.\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that you're happy with it, right?\nYeah.\nSo let's go to the middle where we can see let's open it up and then we can go ahead and hit the logs to make it look better.\nAnd here we can see each step the AI Agent took in order to complete its task.\nPreviously you could kind of do something like this in the linear paths right by clicking on it you can see the inputs and the outputs.\nHere it's just steps because again it's not linear.\nSo it actually lists all of the things that it does and so you can keep track.\nAnd part of prompt engineering or AI Agent engineering is making sure that you you look closely at the steps.\nIf it doesn't look like the way you want it to look, you need to adjust the prompt.\nYou need to adjust the tools.\nIt's all about like seeing what it does and then adjusting.\nSeeing what it does and adjusting and that's how you end up building the best AI Agent system, right?\nYeah.\nUh, so if you run into any errors like that, um, me and Riley were making like a messaging agent and a lot of the times when you said message Muhammad, um, it would spell it differently.\nYeah, I'm the one on the bottom.\nI'm with the U.\nSometimes it would do O.\nYes.\nAnd the AI Agent would be like, well, there is no Muhammad with an O, so I'm not going to send him a message.\nEven though you did mean me.\nUm, and in this case, you want it to be less like a perfectionist and be like, if there is one Muhammad, it's probably me.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd so to fix that, like what you said, just change the system prompt.\nChange the system prompt.\nBe like, get the closest one.\nAll right.\nSo, back to our AI Agent.\nSo, like we're only interacting with it in N8n by opening this chat.\nBut it's like it'd be super, super annoying if every time you wanted to use this AI Agent, uh, to have to go into N8n and, uh, open up the chat and type to it.\nYeah.\nSo, one thing that I like to do and the thing that I've been working on as a side project is creating a group chat with AI Agents.\nAnd the way that you do that is the web hook.\nSo, we can actually go ahead and delete the chat input.\nAnd we can use the, uh, web hook feature right here.\nAnd so, if you click on this web hook feature, yeah, you have this URL right here.\nAnd that's kind of like what we talked about your own endpoint that you can hit wherever you are.\nUm, so and there's two types of them.\nWe talk about the two types.\nSo the first type is they have this test URL which you can use, right?\nSo if you exit out of this and hit test while it's testing, if you hit the test URL, it'll work.\nIf you're not pressing test actively, it will it won't work.\nBut this is nice because as you'll see in a second, we can see exactly where the agent is as we're testing it.\nYeah.\nAnd so let's go ahead and do that real quick.\nLet's set up this web hook a little more though.\nUh, we want this to be a post method because we're both sending information and receiving information back.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAs we talked about earlier.\nYeah.\nAnd we can edit this jumbled mess of a path and just say content agents.\nAnd so now you your URL looks a little nicer.\nAmazing.\nAwesome.\nAnd then respond.\nSo whenever the AI Agent is done, um, it'll tell you what what happened and you can see that information which will show you, uh, respond immediately.\nNo, we want to respond when last node finishes or when it's done.\nYes.\nAwesome.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nThat looks good.\nSo I'm going to bring up my app that I vibe coded and then let's go ahead and add that URL that I just copied.\nSo, this is an app that we vibe coded on the VibeCode app and it actually has an N8n integration built into it.\nAnd so, this is if you want to hit one single web hook, but this app allows you, the app that we created allows you to hit as many web hooks as you want, you can just add them.\nAnd so, right now, we're creating this is like content agent test.\nAnd when we deploy it so that we can hit it over and over again, we're going to just going to call it content agent.\nAnd we're going to make sure that it's active.\nIn order to create an agent like this.\nIn our previous video, we built one of these VAAPs and we actually started a website and community around creating VAAPs.\nSo, if you want to learn more about that, you can see that down below.\nJust know that you could create this with one prompt on, uh, the VibeCode app or any Vibe coding tool, uh, just by saying create an app that allows me to interact with a web hook and send data to a web hook and await its response.\nAnd what's really cool about this and why I'm so excited about this type of vibe coding, which is like the Vibe-Coded Agentic Application, is it simplifies really long workflows down to a single interaction, single web hook, right?\nYou send a web hook in and you await its response.\nThat's what it's doing.\nWhich means that you can change all of this, as we'll get to later.\nAll of this, you could add a hundred different tools with this right now and as long as you keep this the same.\nNothing about the code needs to change, right?\nAnd so this allows you to set up these basic apps and then add backend complexity, backend functionality without it ruining your front end.\nAnd it that is one of the biggest problems.\nI've been deep in the vibe coding space, people trying to build apps with AI, and the part they struggle with is when they're trying to adjust the back end, their front-end code gets messed up.\nWhen you only want to be editing the backend flow.\nAnd it's also hard to have a mental model of your backend, like if you're trying to actually create an AI Agent, which is impossible.\nThis allows you to just hook it up to an AI Agent.\nYou can and then you can build the front end, interact with it, and then if you want to make changes to the agent, all you do is add nodes or you can give the AI Agent access to other AI Agents as we'll show you in a second to build out a better functionality and nothing about your front end will change and that is why I think it's so powerful.\nLet's see how it works.\nUm, yeah, I'll show you, but we're going to run into an error immediately and I'll show you why.\nSo, let's go ahead and test.\nAnd let's just do high because it'll fail.\nAnd if you can see, the AI Agent node failed.\nAnd that's because we kept it as the chat trigger node.\nAnd we don't have that anymore.\nWe have the web hook.\nSo, let's go define below.\nLet's scroll down to the web hook and see our text that says hi.\nUm, we'll just drag that in there.\nAnd yeah, and see it says hi.\nSo notice that whatever you sent in, right?\nIf you go to wherever it failed, you'll see you can look at all of the inputs, you want whatever variable is the thing that you said to be the thing that is in the input.\nYeah.\nSo that way whatever we put in next will be there.\nYeah.\nPerfect.\nNow that it's all set up, let's try a real one.\nSo, let's go ahead and test workflow and let's say give me five hook ideas, um, or, um, creating workflows with Zapier, which is a competitor to N8n.\nShort form short form please.\nSo now the AI Agent was triggered by the app that we created with the Vibe Code app N8n integration which is literally if you go to the Vibe Code app, um, it will literally have the option to use the N8n integration and you can just plug in your web hook.\nYeah.\nAnd so as long as any workflow whether it's an agent or deterministic workflow you can just plug in your web hook and you can build a VAAP, a Vibe-Coded Agentic Application.\nYeah.\nAnd as AI Agents get better over time, okay, you can see here that we got a response.\nSo if you look at the phone, you see that we got a response.\nThis feels illegal to know.\nThis feels illegal to know to believe what I just built is in my hooks.\nIf we search illegal, this feels illegal to know.\nSo think about what we just did there.\nWe basically, um, we created an app and this this app you can vibe code with the with the Vibe Code integration.\nYou could create this in one prompt, right?\nYeah.\nAnd you actually designed this N8n integration in the Vibe Code app.\nUm, and like we're working really hard to make this process seamless and we're going to build a tool that's probably better than N8n, um, to help these workflows.\nI still think is a little too hard, but for right now there's so much value in being first to understand this and actually create, uh, Agents.\nAnd I know people who are selling these agentic apps or VAAPs to companies and making a ton of money because they can actually work with their company data.\nIt doesn't even need to go to the app store.\nYou can share it amongst your peers without even publishing it to the app store, which is really cool.\nAnd on Cursor, you can create web apps that do the same exact thing.\nAnd we're going to be talking about that more in the future as well.\nWhat we just showed was the fact that you could create this sort of Vibe-Coded Agentic Application just by connecting a web hook to an N8n AI Agent that has access to different tools.\nRight.\nRight.\nWhat if I told you that this process right here, which is an AI Agent that has access to tools, can be turned into a tool that another AI Agent has access to.\nYeah, we can.\nWhat if I told you that?\nThat would be I would I would.\nYeah.\nNo way.\nYou wouldn't believe me.\nNo freaking way that works.\nWell, that is 100% possible and that's what we're going to do right now.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, essentially, instead of just a normal tool call that will come back to the AI Agent, we can connect another AI Agent with other tool calls for the AI Agent that we're going to connect.\nUh, which what what do you want to do?\nSo, we get content idea.\nOh, but we could connect our buffer agent to it.\nLet's connect our buffer agent to this for sure.\nActually, let's do that.\nLet's do buffer.\nAnd let's also maybe we can add like image generation too.\nWe can add multiple so it can get content idea, an image, and then send it to buffer through this process, right?\nUh, we're still going to be able to connect it like that phone, right?\nThe phone that we have here, this is still going to be connected to the web hook.\nSo, we're basically empowering our VAAP.\nAnd remember the app that we coded that we vibe coded does not change.\nSo we can literally add infinite levels of complexity which is never good for the sake of adding complexity.\nBut if you want to make more powerful workflows you can edit the back end and this does not change the experience on the front end.\nSo that's what we're going to do.\nWhy don't we go ahead and do that on N8n?\nSo let's go ahead and implement that.\nSo let's go to toolsing because we're going to\n\n\nAdd another AI agent. Yep. Um, and then if you actually, it's at the top, call N8n workflow tool. And so this will basically just call another N8n workflow. And essentially, it doesn't even have to be another AI agent. It could just be, you know, the linear flow that we had in the beginning. Let's go ahead and add that. And so now we need to select which tool, uh, yeah, which workflow. And so actually, we already have uh, an agent like that. And so let's go ahead and explain this. So the model that we use still is Claude, um, and in this case, we gave it just simple memory so it can remember the user's first prompt and then come back to it if it ever forgets. And then we have actually five tools. So let's break that down even more. Um, there are all HTTP requests, if you remember what that is. Um, and if you look inside, it's an HTTP request to FAL, um, for text to video and returns the response via link to the media. Amazing. Um, so basically, it just hits this FAL. Do you want to explain what FAL is? Yes. So FAL is a tool, and do you have, let's go ahead and go to their uh, web page. They are basically a platform that allows you to get access to all the creative AI tools. You've heard of VO, you've heard of ChatGBT image generator. This tool has all of the popular APIs. And so you can actually chain these together, or you can give uh, N8n access to these APIs. So if you want image generation to be part of your workflow, you can just give an agent access to these APIs. Yeah. But not only can you just use these APIs directly, you can actually create very similar to what we're doing with N8n, you can create flows. So there it will edit the image. So it might generate an image and then you might have an edit step which would edit the image that it just generated, and then you'll have another step beyond that which might add text to it, and then it will and then it gets sent through the API. So the same way that you can take a full agent that we are that like we're doing on N8n and turn it into a single tool, we're taking a workflow on FAL and turning it into one single API endpoint. And it looks like this. If you go back to N8n, right, this whole workflow, which is multiple steps, just looks like one single uh, HTTP request on N8n, right? Yeah, and so what we can do is we can just turn those into tools that we can use on N8n, and that's what we've done. And so we can actually pull up the app here. I'll help him with this, right? You pull up the VibeCode app here on the right side of the screen, you can see the VibeCode app. So this is another one, um, that Muhammad created. And so you and so show the web hook. So here, the same thing that we did, um, for the last uh, Vibe-Coded Agentic Application that we created. We connected to a web hook, but you've already done that because they get saved into the app that you create. Yeah. So let's go ahead and uh, test this.\nSo, generate an image of a cat with a sombrero, and yeah, then turn it into a video where it rides. No, dances. Yeah. Let's test the web flow. Send it to the web hook. Amazing. Let's see how the web flow works. Yeah, it's going to the text image. Amazing. And so you can see here, like normal, the AI agent thinks. Now it's using the tool, in which case, one of the tools is a workflow on FAL. Right. Yeah. And again, we're experimenting with all these different things, and we're using all these different external tools and connecting them and using the power of AI to actually know what to do in the moment. Um, and this is how people are creating content at like automated content. So, it looks, it looks like it made the, it went text to image. So, it probably generated the cat. And then now it's turning that image and text to video. Right now, we, it's, we see a success. Success. Let's scroll down. That's our image of the cat with the sombrero. And then if we go to the right, let's watch it dance. Hey. Yeah. Oh, that is freaky. That's okay. I mean, now, wait, let me see it again. That's fire. All right. So, now we have this cat dancing. That's pretty sick. I guess that's as good as a cat could get. Yes, that's great. Also gave me the first image back. So that's cool. That's a cute cat. Love it. Awesome. Now connect it to the other agent. So to connect it to the other agent, we're going to want to add this other trigger note. And that's called when executed by another workflow. And to do that, you'll just click this plus, add another trigger. And then it's right here when executed by another workflow. And when you open it, the input data mode should just accept all data. So whenever another AI agent like this one calls this other AI agent, the media AI agent, it'll take in all the data that it knows and then work with it. So really think about what we're doing here. So as you just saw, we sent in a request exactly to generate an image of a cat and then to turn it into a video. Yeah. And we could do that, and we could set it up to an external app that you can VibeCode. If you've been watching my content, you know how to VibeCode at this point. Now, instead of using the web hook on this one, we just switched it to when executed by another workflow. If you go to the other workflow, the master workflow is what I call it. This agent is above it in authority. So now, instead of it being triggered by you, it's going to be triggered by another agent that is triggered by you. So now, like what we could do here is like we can now generate videos that are more relevant to us because it has access to all of my content in my Notion. Yeah, I have an idea. So now we have this master agent set up that can create a video. Um, it can create a video if it wants. Let's choose which one it was. We have a bunch of them. Media agent is the right one. Source database. That's fine. Let's give it a description on what the workflow does so the head agent knows what it does. Mhm. Um, this workflow uses an AI agent to generate different types of media because it can also generate photos and videos. And then let's rename it just media agent so we know. Cool. Okay. So, we just added this as a tool. So, would it work? Could we use it as a tool now? Yeah, let's try it. All right. So, now we have the VAAPs open, uh, that same one that we made earlier. So we just added another AI agent to our AI agent. Amazing. Um, and that's tool call. Yeah. Let's go add call N8n workflow tool. Really cool. Um, and let's make it post on buffer. All right. I think we made this agent, um, in another video. Yeah. So a few days ago, we created an agent that has access to buffer, which is the tool that we use to schedule social media posts. And so it's called the poster agent, as you can see here. Yeah. We'll connect that and let's add a description. This workflow has an agent to post on buffer. And so now our master agent has context about what this workflow does and what to pass to it. Perfect. And now let's move that here. Let's rename it poster. Mr. Poster poster poker. Rename. Cool. All right. So now we have an agent that has access to four normal tools as well as two other agents, which is an agent that has other tools within it. Yeah. And we set this up. So now we can try it on our VAAPs. Wait, does the poster agent have a trigger of use tool? Yeah. Uh, yeah, when executed by another workflowing hit this. So we're ready to go. Cool. In fact, it actually also has get content SOP read SOP. Okay. So we could actually remove those. Let's go ahead and remove it. We don't need to save it for this one, but like right, that outside of the scope of this one. Yeah. Um, and there's no need to do things twice, you know. Yep. Okay. So now let's go ahead and Yeah. test workflow. I want you to please write a short form video using the short form hooks as an example about how tigers might go extinct. The post should be a short form script with an image of a tiger and then post it on social media through the buffer tool, and that gets sent in to the agent. So now it needs to actually go to Notion first, probably. There we go. It searched the Notion. Now it's thinking again. That's that's what we want, right? And now search. Now it got it, searched for the right page, and then it got the information from the page. Yep. And now it should go to the media agent. There it is. Now it's inside the media agent. Now it's generating an image. This might take 15 to 20 seconds here. Um, and this will go to my buffer. Yeah. And so the media agent is done. So I'm sure it returned um, the image, the image that you wanted. And now the agent is thinking again what to do. And it went to poster. Now it's going to poster, the poster agent. And I am just going to plug this into my screen right here. Other side. And and if we refresh buffer, here you go. We see the title. And so, um, this is awesome, right? We have this image of a generated tiger, and we have a short form script right here from 100,000 to less than 4,000 tiger in just a century. And one of the hook templates is from X to Y in less than a certain period of time. So, it actually took a hook from my Notion, and but here's hope. And so, this is kind of it. I feel like it's pulling this from my own voice. I do never use hashtags. So, this is something that I might want to change in the system prompt, too. You could do something like that. Yeah. And I also did an image post, so it might think that it was trying to do a tweet. Um, but this is really cool that it used the from X to Y uh, hook format. Yeah. And Yeah. And we just threw this together last minute, and it was able to go through all these different steps. Yeah. And it's sort of like Lego pieces, you know, you have different types of agents, and if you want to make a whole new workflow, you just connect, you know, media poster, new agent, new brand new utility. And going on the Lego piece theme, like just realize that like at any time you can copy everything, and you can paste them just like Lego pieces. If we started a new template, like you could create a new N8n page, you can copy it just by, you mean you first of all, you could duplicate the whole thing. Yeah. But you could also, um, just copy and paste parts of a workflow or the whole workflow and paste things together. And whenever you get stuck, just always remember to ask AI. Take screenshots of the page or just copy the full JSON. In fact, that's what you should probably do most of the time is just copy the JSON and paste it into chat GBT and ask questions to really, um, to really get through the tough parts. Like if you get stuck, and you will get stuck. It's almost guaranteed. So if you get stuck, you're not stupid. You're learning something that is actually valuable. And if you fight through it, you won't regret it. Yeah. And it's only going to get easier from here, too. Okay. We talked about a lot here. And I think, I think we should just mentally recount what we talked about today. So we talked about today how AI agents are basically changing everything. The length of time that an AI agent or an AI chatbot can basically work is doubling every seven months. Yeah. And so we're at the point where an AI agent can just, you can give it a request, and it can work for over an hour. Yeah. Soon it will be over 24 hours. Soon it will be a week. And that's it's obvious. The trend is obvious. Like you work, you're way deeper in the AI agent space. AI agents are getting more powerful. It's getting easier to connect them to tools. In future videos, we'll talk about MCP, which even makes it easier to communicate with tools. Yeah. We're heading towards a world, and correct me if I'm wrong here, where AI agents are just going to be freely roaming and just grabbing things, and you're going to be able to give them money that there's startups that are working on giving uh, like USDcoin or or uh, crypto to these AI agents that can go out and if it needs to pay humans to do tasks. And so understanding that modern AI models like Gemini 2.5, like 03, like um, Claude Opus, all these tools are built to use tools. They're built to be agents, and it's only going to get better. And yeah, I mean, look at this chart. Yeah, I mean, if we start from the very beginning, Turochamp, the first AI chess, um, the AI tech was not there, and there's no adoption. Big Sleep. That was my first interaction with AI. It's like an image generator. First one of its kind. Complete trash. But again, is just that was just the beginning. 3.5 reasoning agents. And if you can see the AI tech is up here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But the adoption really is not where it's supposed to be. And I think this area right here is an area for opportunity. Yeah. And I think, I think that's why N8n uh, is so popular is I think it's addressing this gap. Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of other tools. And so, while we're talking about N8n, um, I think N8n is actually like annoyingly hard to use. I think for someone who's not technical, who doesn't really know the ins and outs of documentation, HTTP requests, it's really annoying. This is something that we're going to try and solve at some point. Just to be transparent and open about it, like we want to solve the N8n problem because I think the key to VibeCode is being able to VibeCode backends and workflows and agents. I think that's where all the magic is. I think people are getting bored of making landing pages with uh, VibeCode tools. No matter how like well the AI streams out, it's, it's getting a little bit boring. And so I think the key to creating like really useful apps that anyone can build for any reason, um, the same way that like Cap Cut made it super easy for anyone to create content. Like I think all the magic of that happens in the back end, being able to use these backend workflows. But this is like a two or three-year run. And so like right now, you have this window where it's still hard to create these back-end workflows. That's a good thing. Anytime something is hard but just now possible are the things where\n\n\nYou can make millions of dollars.\nAnd I don't mean that in like a selling you shovels way because I'm not trying to sell you anything.\nWhat I am trying to say is like, I got into AI right as it became possible.\nPeople didn't really know what it was, and the amount of opportunity in the AI, in just in the LLM space at the beginning was like so much opportunity.\nAnd like right now, I think AI Agents is in that stage, and so understanding AI Agents is very important.\nI think N8n is the best place to start.\nAnd so thank you for watching this video.\nThis has been a grind, a long one.\nUm, but we're going to make some more videos in the future.\nYeah, let us know what you guys want to see next.\nAmazing.\nSee you guys later.\n",
