  "cleanText": "This is the fastest way to build a mobile app with Cursor. You can start by building the app from your Phone and then share it with Cursor. And then in less than an hour, you can have the app sent to the App Store. In this video, we created an app that lets me and my friends swipe on movies like Tinder in a room. And when we both liked one, we matched. We can immediately share the app with friends and then we sent the app to the App Store for review in under an hour. We're going to show you every step of the process. Let's dive in. So whenever I want to start building a mobile app, I always start in VibeCode. So I usually just start by describing my idea in simple language. I want a movie matcher app that allows me and my friends to swipe on the same set of movies and then when we both find a match, it will show us which movies we match for. I can click start game. Then I can enter a room. So like a room is generated with a random fourdigit pin. I can put in that pin and my friends would put that in as well. And then we both enter the same room and we swipe on the same movies. Start by just building out the front end for this. Don't worry about the backend features. We can just use some mock data for right now. And yeah, and I'll click generate and wait till VibeCode generates me a great first draft of this product. Your problem statement is that like when you and friends sit down to try and watch a movie, you spend like way too much time trying to pick a movie. Yeah, I think everyone's faced this problem. So, we can see what the agent is doing right now. It says, &quot;I'll build a movie matcher app with a game-like interface where you and friends can swipe in movies and find matches.&quot; So, it's exploring the existing template and building the movie matcher app with state management, navigation, and the screens that we need. All right. So, the app's done now and let's see how it looks.\n\nCool. So, we have Movie Matcher the game.\nUm, start new game.\nOoh.\nOkay. So, it has the little It has swipes, but it's kind of stuck at the bottom. Just take a screenshot. Yeah, that's a good idea. It looks pretty good, though. Look at that. No, it does. I I think it looks good. It just needs to be centered and Yeah. So, I'll take a screenshot and I'll add that screenshot here. I'll be like when I start a room and begin playing the game and the cards load up with the movies for the various movies that I have to swipe on. The swipe animation's great, but the cards show up in like the bottom right corner. I think there's some issue with the spacing, the sizing, or the padding. It should be in the center and it should be large and take up like a large chunk of the screen. So I I think you know think logically around how you set up that screen and make sure that you logically construct it such that this issue doesn't happen. I've also attached an image for your reference.\n\nVery well put together prompt there. I love it. You've done this a time or two. I like I think it's really good to include images when especially with like design changes. Yeah. Yeah. Because it can usually figure out what the problem is pretty quickly. Okay. So what was the other feature? So you could hit new game. What was the other button? Join game. Join. Oh, nice. Nice. So, so essentially when we get this app to Cursor, we'll set up the back end such that each time you can create these rooms and then rather than like having a whole system where you add friends and like complicating it. Let's just keep rooms and so you join a room. Could you potentially add a feature that you go share and like you can send it to me on text, click on it, immediately join the room. Yeah. Okay. Sick. We can definitely add that. It's a good idea. And then yeah, I'll download the app. Like you'll be able to send it to me.\n\nSo, it looks like it figured out the issue and it's trying to fix it right now. Okay, we can see if this made the edit. We can start a new game. And cool. The cards are centered now. And we can swipe on them. Wow, that animation. Oo, that looks pretty good, actually. This would have taken me like two hours to to code out back in the old days.\nWow. Um, kind of a smooth animation the way it flies off and it turns red or green. Yeah. Can I try it? Yeah, go for it. Oh, that's kind of nice, actually. Okay. All right. Cool. Um, so maybe we want these like buttons to to appear below the card. And then maybe we want there to be some haptics. That could be fun. So we can say make sure the red cross dislike button and the green heart like button appear below the cards which have the movie details and add some haptics when I swipe left and right on the carts and cook. So you want to explain haptics for those who are brand new to vibe coding? Yeah. So when you make native mobile apps and you know if I made this on lovable or bolt or any of those other tools, you couldn't add things like haptics or you couldn't do things easily like camera access, contact access, calendar access. The good part with building native mobile apps with Cursor and web code is that you can use these native libraries like haptic. So you can make your Phone go likez, you know, satisfying feeling like on the cat GPT app um when like it's loading a response, you get that nice little like vibration thing and it makes it feel like almost alive in a way. Yeah, exactly. Okay, cool. It made the update. Let's check this out. Start new game. Okay, amazing. That looks so good. Then it looks really good. Yeah, we can just we can just ship this to Cursor now.\n\nOkay, so we're moving to Cursor. Why are we doing that? We want to do a few things in Cursor. One, we want to add some assets that is required by Apple to submit our app to the App Store, which is the icon, the Splash Screen, and things like our website, privacy policy, that kind of stuff. And then two, we want to add backend functionality. So we want to actually, you know, have rooms that are on Firebase and currently we need to install packages and do things that are currently not supported with the Vibe Code App. Amazing. So to do that on Cursor, we can just open the menu here, click connect to SSH, connect via SSH, copy this command, open a Cursor window, click connect via SSH. It's the same thing. Okay. So, so, okay, let's go slow here just because I'm trying to figure out how we're doing this. So, um, on the Vibe Code App, when you press share, you press you press menu, you can click connect via SSH. Amazing. It opens up this and then you just open up any new Cursor window. Yeah. Or Windsurf or anything, you know, it's the same for Windurf. So, I copy it from the Vibe Code App. Then I click connect via SSH and Cursor right here. And then I click add new SSH. Don't you paste it and then you hit add new SSH? It doesn't matter. Okay. Yeah. I I click add new SSH host cuz we're connecting to a new project. We're going to add a new host. And then it says enter this command. That's example SSH hello at Microsoft. We can see that our SSH command on VI code looks very similar. Mhm. Um it starts with SSH. So we can just paste that in and press enter. And then we can just press enter for the first one. Okay. And then it says host added. We can click connect. So this will open a new Cursor window. And it says, do you want to continue? The first time you connect to a new project, it'll say this. Um but it shouldn't after that. Just click continue. And then it says enter a password. Again, we can copy that. Okay. So the Vibe Code App gives you the SSH command which we've already copi copied. And it also gives you a password which we use here. Yeah. And then we'll paste the password and click enter. Amazing. And then it'll take a few seconds. I'll just position my window here. There we go. Um, so at the bottom it'll say downloading VS Code server. Wait until this is done and the loading here stops. So now it's done um setting it up. And there there we go. You'll also know when this clone repository button um pops up. But let's start by opening the folder that we want. So this when you click open folder, click on workspace. That's going to be the workspace that you're working in. And then click okay. Okay. So it should be the the one on the far right should be workspace. Yeah. Okay. Um now we've opened the workspace and this is your project uh project's code. Um, don't worry about these environment variables. They are our personal secret environment variables in the Vibe Code App that it doesn't matter if anyone has access to because they're they're fake. Um, one of the cool things about the Vibe Code App is you don't need to put in any of your environment variables. It will just replace them. Once you export it to Cursor, then you do have to use your own API keys. Yeah. But we're not exporting to Cursor right now. We're just creating a two-way connection via SSH. So you don't need to worry about that. So those aren't the real keys. Those are But the real keys are in the Vibe Code App. The real keys the how that works is a secret. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. Now when you make a change on Cursor, right? Like on if you guys have watched my videos before when we use Cursor normally we do local host like you run this locally and it's usually a web browser. In this case replace the local host web browser with the mobile app except it's realtime sync. You can make a change on the Vibe Code App and it will update on Cursor. Make a change on Cursor and it will update. It'll always stay updated on your on your Phone. And you don't have to use the Vibe Code App. You can, you know, make a build yourself. Um there are a few advantages though. One is like you don't have to worry about API keys until you're ready to publish to the App Store. And then two, um you don't have to keep rebuilding the app that we handle all of that. So your changes are instant. So for example, if I ask this to let me make this cloud for sonnet. Let's say I want to change the name of the app in the home screen from movie matcher to movie Movie Buddy. Movie buddy. Perfect. And so now it's just we're using Cursor and it's making changes. It's thinking about it. It's going to generate some code and then when you hit apply it'll be updated. Yeah. So, it depends on your Cursor settings. I think the best settings to get set up is make sure you click the settings button. You go to indexing in docs and you make sure this codebase has been 100% indexed. That's usually really good and looks like mine has. I also have a feature where it like auto saves the apply, but by default, you will have to accept all before before the changes are saved. Okay, so this is done. Once the changes are done, you can click the menu button and you can click reload. And now it's buddy. Amazing. That's super cool. So you didn't have to rebuild your app. You didn't have to run any local host server. And if we were using AI features, we didn't have to put in any API keys either. But now, um, so this is a great start. Let's accept all of these changes. Um, now we want to make sure that we actually fetch movies from an API. We act like right now the Shaw Shank redemption is just placeholder data that the app put there. Yeah. What we want to do is we actually want to have access to a database that is up to date that is shows us real movies that are and then obviously like you could make it better through sorting them through some mechanism or separating them by genre etc etc but we want these to be real movies ideally with real placeholder images for them right yeah exactly so we can go look up free movie database API um and there are a few options I think the top two are OMD DB and TMDB. Um, based on my research, uh, TMDB gives you the images for the movies and OMDB does not. So, we're going to use TMDB. So, we can go here, click get an API key. I have already made an account and so I have an API key which I'm going to get from here. Okay. So, I copied this. Now let's let me test it out here. So let's try this out. All right. So that did not work. Want to just toss this whole thing to Cursor and be like make it better. Yeah. I mean I think that's honestly the best move right now. We can just toss this whole thing to Cursor and we can tell it I am using the TMDB API. Here are my credentials. Here is my authorization header. And I'll paste the long one here. There we go. And here is my API key. There we go. And then let me give it some more guides. Um that discover. We probably want to use discover. So I'll give it some more links cuz Cursor Cursor can actually browse the internet and if you give it the specific links that are necessary, you're just basically like increasing the probability that it'll get it correct because you could just say I'm using TMDB. Yeah, I did say that and it can browse it. But I know that we want to use the the discover option. And so I can just um you know put that in um and so here is how to use the discover option. So all I did here was I copied the curl request. You can use it for any language programming language you're using. Curl is like very common. And then at the end I'll say I want to replace all the fake data by fetching real movies that are fetched at the start when creating a new room. Nice. We still have yet to write any code. We've only copied code and cop I mean we're only like five prompts deep into this. Yeah. I mean on the Vibe Code. This is second one on Cursor. Yeah. I mean, the first one wrong Cursor is just changing the name. You think this is going to work out of the box, or do you think we're going to have to I think we gave it a lot of context, so it should work. Okay, it's trying to run this command. I'm going to skip it cuz we don't need to run anything since we're testing it out on the Vibe Code\n\n\nApp.\nSo, it's done. Now, it can reload the app on Vibe Code by clicking menu and then the reload button on the top right.\nAmazing.\nAnd nothing could be different on this page.\nUm, and then we start new game.\nIt's loading the movies.\nThere we go.\nNo way.\nBallerina.\nWait, wait, wait.\nSo, go to um is 7.1 maybe like the IMDZ score.\nCan you look that movie up?\nThere.\nIt's the exact poster John from the creators of John Wick.\nWe can see that.\nScroll over.\nGo back.\n7.21.\nOkay.\nBut maybe some doesn't matter.\nThat's basically right.\nLet's check another one.\nStraw.\nOkay.\nStraw 6.5.\nThis says 8.0.\nSo the data, it seems like the rating is wrong.\nOkay.\nIt's the average rating given by users on the TMDB platform, not on IMDb.\nGot it.\nSo it is very different and that's okay.\nI think we should show more stuff on this card ideally like show the release date, show the title in full.\nSo maybe we can try we can get rid of this the stuff at the top.\nSwipe movies.\nSo it'll just like give us more space.\nOh, okay.\nI like that.\nI like that.\nSo um yeah, I mean we could make this change on Vibe Code or we could make it on Cursor.\nUm my instinct was to go with Vibe Code, but let's just do it with Cursor.\nYeah, let's do Cursor.\nDo you have whisper flow?\nUh, yes I do.\nOn the screen where I'm swiping movies, can you remove the header that says swipe movies just have the part that says room uh with like the number of the room as sort of the the top header part?\nAnd then also, can you make the card the movie card like bigger?\nJust make it like taller and make the width also bigger cuz right now I can't see the full movie name.\nI also can't see the image of the movie fully.\nSo I just want want it to be bigger.\nAnd then also when I click on the card, not swipe on it, just open like a full details page so I can see the whole movie card um in its totality and make it look really nice.\nShouldn't we show more of the data like the year?\nAnd I mean we're showing the year 2024.\nOh, I didn't even see that.\nThis is actually a really cool app.\nOne thing if you want to check do is there was there anything about like where you could watch the movie like the streaming platform.\nOh yeah, that that'd be cool.\nSo I'm just going to search this up.\nWatch providers.\nWatch providers.\nThat's that that is the the most useful feature actually.\nYeah.\nSo you can hit that this API.\nSo we can copy this link.\nWe can copy the curl request.\nUm, and then we can, um, let's try it for for this random movie, Sonic the Hedgehog.\nCopy the ID, paste it in here, and let's try it.\nThis is what the data looks like.\nIt gives you results.\nUm, oh, wow.\nSorted by country.\nSo, that's a lot of data.\nSo, let's find the US.\nGuess I'll just have to scroll.\nI forget they're all different depending on what country.\nThat's insane.\nThat looks like the US the longest one.\nSo you can watch it on Amazon video, Apple TV, Google Play Movies, YouTube, Fendango, Microsoft, Flick Thing, and Plex and so that's where you can rent it and then flat rate or buy um Okay.\nYeah, I think flat rate is the streaming services.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, let's check it.\nThat Sonic the Hedgehog 3 or oops there's a fourth one apparently too.\nYeah, watch now Prime Video.\nAmazing.\nUm and that's the first one in the flat rate which is the streaming services.\nSo I'll copy this response as well and we'll add that feature next.\nCool.\nThis is coming together.\nThis is like a legit app.\nYeah, it's Oh, it added the haptics too.\nCan I feel it?\nNice.\nI dig it.\nSo, we can set up the rooms and then we can publish the this app on the app store.\nLet's go.\nWe might not even need authentication cuz if you just authenticate with rooms, what's the point, right?\nYeah, just create room and then text have the text feature.\nI think that's key.\nYeah.\nSend it to your friend.\nOkay, looks like it's done.\nSo, we can reload the app and check it out.\nStart new game.\nWow.\nThat looks so good.\nLet's go.\nThat's insane.\nThat's awesome.\nLook, that added all these animations as well.\nAnd we still have pass like KO the whole poster 2024 6.6.\nThis looks weird.\nI think this app is is ready to ship.\nI think the one thing you may want authentication for would be like um would be like if you could like save movies like people might want to save like their favorite movies or something.\nYeah, but like I don't think that's needed for MVP.\nOkay, this is kind of annoying.\nWhen I swipe it opens it, regardless annoying.\nSo, okay, let me accept these changes and I'll be like this looks great.\nBut now, regardless of if I swipe left or right, it opens the movie details right after I swipe.\nThe movie details should only open when I tap on it, like not when I swipe on it.\nSo, make sure that you think hard about how to differentiate between those two.\nSo funny that we've moved to the era where you have to like where you basically tell AI how to allocate its thinking resources.\nYou're like think hard about this specific thing and it actually works.\nThink harder actually works.\nI have read a lot of code from anthropic where they where they say if prompt includes think harder give more tokens.\nThink harder is a great prompt hack.\nYou know I think I don't know if it came I think it was like users doing it that made anthropic put it in.\nBut you you were paying for the thinking tokens so it's not like it's a hack.\nI mean, we're still paying for it, but it does work.\nThis app looks amazing.\nLike, it just looks perfect.\nI don't No, it does look really good.\nThe swipe gesture is so good.\nLike, I feel like this one usually Cursor messes up at So, what what else do we have left?\nSo, let's say it fixes this thing.\nAnd then we're uh the next thing you were going to do is the streaming platform.\nYeah.\nSo, platform and then uh and then the rooms.\nYeah.\nThe database.\nAnd so for the rooms, just to be clear, so for the rooms, we want to be able to do this, right?\nIt's ju just like Tinder, right?\nWhen we both swipe right on a movie, we want it to match.\nSo we want to be able to create a room.\nAnd so Ansh wants to create a feature that allows us to with one click, basically create a room, and then he can send it to me.\nI can open the app, we can both swipe, and then we're if we're both in a room, we can match.\nYeah, exactly.\nOkay.\nSo, let me reload this app now.\nAll right.\nSo, instead of tapping to show the details, we we just added a new button.\nUm, it's the info button.\nThat's how you can see the details.\nAnd then, yeah, the cards look great.\nUm, now we want to know which streaming platforms to actually watch these movies in.\nSo, I'm going to paste um this API that from TMDB I can copy this link right here.\nDo we need to which location we want?\nMaybe we did US or whatever cuz there Yeah, that's true.\nSo, if we look at this data, it gives like the locations, the UG, US, like these are all countries.\nUm, so I'm going to paste first of all I'm just going to copy everything and then even the response I'll copy that and I then come the very bottom and I can be like hey above I've given you a API that gives me the providers of the movie like where can I watch it like on which streaming services.\nSo, for each movie that you show me in the movie card, I want you to show me which providers I can watch them on.\nSo, is it Netflix?\nIs it Amazon Prime?\nOr there are a bunch of options, but I only want you to show me US streaming services.\nI don't care about renting or buying.\nYou can maybe show the rent and buy data in the the details the details card, but in the main view, just show me the streaming services.\nYeah, I feel like that's kind of everything I would want to know.\nThe streaming service, is it like a good movie?\nRight.\nWe have some rating.\nUm, it shows the So, I can see like if it's an actor that I like.\nUm, obviously there's if we kept iterating there's a lot of other things you could add, but I think this is a good first experience.\nWhere would you want it to display the streaming services?\nProbably like right here next to the the rating maybe cuz there's some space there.\nSo, it just finished.\nLet's see if we got the streaming services.\nSo, now it's loading movies.\nSo, now it's loading movies.\nIt might take a little bit of time to load the streaming services.\nOh, so this one Oh, doesn't have any like streaming.\nSo, it didn't show it like I told it to.\nI see.\nBut it has a rent and buy option and so it shows me those.\nAnd it shows the logos for them, too, which is awesome.\nAnd then this one has streaming.\nSo, let's go.\nIt shows it to me.\nI didn't know it would show the images for each one.\nYeah, that's pretty cool.\nSo, this one doesn't have streaming or but that's that's the API because we know it's working for the other ones, right?\nRight.\nAll right.\nAnd also Mission Imp.\nDidn't this just come out?\nLike this is 2025.\nI think it's out.\nThis is coming out in the future.\nUm, Valerina, I think it's probably coming out.\nIt says 2025.\nOh, Amazon video.\nOkay, cool.\nUm, Thunderbolt.\nThese are all super new movies.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, um, but this one, Straw, this is out Netflix.\nOkay.\nAmazing.\nI mean, we need to specify like only movies that are like came out before the current date.\nI think this app is good as is.\nI think we should just add the rooms and we should swipe and see if we can map on a movie.\nYeah, let's do it.\nSo, now we need to set up Firebase.\nNow, I'm going to build a Firebase project.\nSo, to do that, I can just open up Firebase.\nUm, so I'll just search for Firebase.\nAnd if you've watched our old videos, we used to do this a lot.\nGo to console and I can click create new Firebase project.\nLet's call this Movie Buddy matter.\nYou can add this if you want, but it just makes the weight a little bit longer.\nSo I I don't like adding it usually.\nThat's provisioning these resources.\nThis should be done.\nAnd then on Cursor we can say now can you add Firebase to this project?\nMake sure to add FirebaseJS version 10 and make sure to connect the Firebase Fire Store database.\nI also want it such that when I start a new game, that game or the room or whatever is stored in Firebase with all the same movies and then I can share the pin for that room with a friend of mine and the friend can enter that same pin and join that room and swipe on the same movies.\nbefore starting the game um and playing the the game in the room, there should be like a waiting screen where I'm waiting for like my friends to join the room and they can enter the pin to join the room and that should all live update.\nAnd then yeah, once I'm done, I should be able to look at um you know the matches that me and my friends had.\nSo what movies did I swipe on positively that my friends also swiped on positively?\nSo these are a lot of changes but make sure that you think it through and build them throughout the codebase.\nThis is a massive task.\nHonestly, this is a very very big task.\nAnd I we're not done yet.\nSo in Firebase when you come here, make sure you click on web.\nWhy did you click web instead of mobile?\nSo with mobile you have to make new builds and go through Xcode and all that process.\nBut because um React Native, we're using React Native.\nWe can use either the mobile version or the web version.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nIt's both both the same thing.\nSo I can also copy this Firebase config or you can just copy the whole thing.\nDoesn't really matter.\nKeep those secret.\nBy the way, here is my Firebase config.\nAfter the Firebase config, you don't really need to keep it secret.\nUm yeah, it it should be fine.\nlike anyone who uses Firebase has their Firebase config like public.\nYou just need to make sure that when you give this app to other people, you add rules to your database so people can't access it.\nBut for now, we're just going to set it up um in test mode.\nSo, we're going to create a database um just go with the defaults.\nSo, these are the secure rules, right?\nSo, make sure if you're launching this to real people, you ask chat GPT or Claude or Cursor or Vibe Code, whatever your favorite AI agent is, like what these rules should be.\nUm, but for now, we're just going to start in test mode.\nThat means your data is open by default and enable to enable quick setup.\nSo, I'm just going to start in test mode for now.\nSo, I've created this database.\nSo, we did two things.\nWe created a web firebased project and we created a fire store database.\nUm, and this these are your rules by the way, the ones that you'd want to change if you ever launch this to to production and gave it to real people.\nBut yeah, this is this is where we are.\nThis is all we need.\nUh, this is all we need to give and let's just let Cursor cook.\nOkay, so all we need is no authentication needed.\nThat makes sense.\nWe're just creating database.\nCool.\nAll right, it's loading.\nOkay, maybe it wasn't done.\nLet's try again.\nWe got an error.\nI am just going to copy this error.\nPaste it back into Cursor.\nI'm getting this error when I click start new game.\nPlease fix.\nSo, yeah.\nI'm not sure why this error is happening, but we can figure it out.\nCool.\nThis is the hardest part, though.\nIt just added like a thousand lines of code.\nThat's actually And that was the That was one prompt, right?\nThat was one prompt.\nIt took like 20 minutes.\nLike it actually took 10 minutes.\nLike it actually took 10 plus minutes to integrate Firebase so that we can create rooms so that we could swipe.\nSo I just made this change and there's this warning here.\n\n\nUm, we'll dismiss it.\nUm, so I can show you my prompts.\nThere were a few errors that happened, but I just copy pasted them back in.\nNothing crazy.\nUm, I just copy pasted it back.\nAnd but there was one change I had to make in the code that's pretty important that the AI couldn't figure out.\nAnd this is the same error that like Kevin and Muhammad ran into yesterday.\nThis is the error with Firebase.\nIf you use like Superbase or you use instant DB or Convex, you probably won't need to do this.\nBut basically there's these two lines of code that it's given in the documentation by expo.\nWhen you're setting up Firebase, you need to copy these two lines of code and you paste in your metro.config.js file.\nOkay.\nSo if you're using Firebase, just make sure if you're using Firebase, we'll paste these like docs from Expo.\nJust give this context to your Cursor or VibeCode App agent when it's setting up Firebase.\nSo like Cursor just doesn't normally do it.\nCursor.\nYeah, it just didn't know to search this up.\nThere are a few things to be aware with Firebase.\nUse version 9 or 10.\nUh, use the JS version and then make sure you paste in these docs from Expo.\nSo that's pretty much it.\nAnd then you should shouldn't face any issues.\nUm, you might face some, but you can just paste them back in like I did.\nUm, I just said I think you broke something and pasted an error back in.\nSo now click start game.\nIt's loading movie, so it takes a little bit of time.\nNo way.\nRoom it has 034.\nNow I have the share button and I can send this to you Riley.\nBut you need to share the app with me first, right?\nOh yeah.\nSo I'll send you the room and then I'll also click this click publish click share and share the app with you as well.\nSo Ansh just texted it to me and so what I need to do is with the VibeCode App, I can very easily, like you can share apps with me and I can open them.\nSo I'm going to open up this app right here and it immediately downloads.\nI have now a movie.\nUh, so let me create the game.\nOkay, you create the game.\nUm, I guess I have to create a new room.\nSo, the PIN is 9826.\nDo you want to join my game?\nJoin game.\n9826.\nOh, and actually this is going to be sick.\nSo, maybe let me share this new one with you.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, I share this with you.\nNow, click join game.\nNow, click join game.\nAnd look, look at the form.\nHey, let's go from messages.\nThat's crazy.\nExcept I can't do anything.\nI can't press enter.\nThe keyboard is blocking it.\nOh, okay.\nI guess we have to make a change.\nWe got to make a change.\nSo, um, let me accept these in the join game screen.\nUm, you both you show fake keyboard and you show real keyboard.\nJust don't show the real keyboard.\nUm, we'll just have input from the fake keyboard in that in that screen.\nOh, actually, no.\nI want to show the real keyboard cuz then you get the auto complete.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, in the join game screen, I want to be able to click a done button on my keyboard or like click outside the keyboard to like dismiss the keyboard.\nRight now, there's no way to dismiss the keyboard.\nYeah.\nAlso, don't show a fake keyboard there.\nUh, the real one is good enough.\nWe can use Apple's best feature.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat is actually so sick.\nAnd so it shared it and it looks at the most recent message and it just grabs a code from it or something.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo if you format a message with like a code and it since we're doing four-digit codes, six-digit codes, those usually auto complete.\nSo, as you can see here, he's making changes to the VibeCode App.\nAnd since I'm synced with Ansh's project after Cursor is done loading, we're both going to hit refresh and we're both going to have a new app.\nYeah.\nSo, Cursor is almost done.\nUm, we'll wait.\nWe'll wait until it stops going and then we both need to hit reload in just a second.\nSo, yeah, let's both hit reload.\nI don't know how yours loaded faster than mine, but Okay.\nSo, you want to start a new game?\nYeah, let me start a new game.\nI mean, you could start one, too.\nSo, now we have a new pin.\nLet me share that with you.\nYeah, but that should autocomplete.\nWhen you click join game, I'm going to hit join game.\nTap to enter pin from messages.\nNow, we can dismiss it.\nJoin room.\nCool.\nSo, we're in the room and I can see I'm smart wolf and you're cool tiger.\nOh, and you only you have control over the game.\nYeah, I have control over start the game.\nSo, why don't you ready up?\nSo, Oh, I can ready up.\nOh, so now instantly it updated on my screen that you're ready.\nWait, whoa, whoa, whoa.\nCan I try?\nCan I do a reverse it?\nThat is so sick.\nReady up.\nAnd now the Oh my god, that's crazy.\nSo, we're ready.\nAnd now let's start the game.\nOh, what?\nSo, wait, what will happen if you swipe left?\nOkay, so I can just go speed.\nYou can go at your own speed.\nOkay, I don't want to watch that.\nNah, I don't really want to watch that.\nSo, that's Let's go at our own speeds and see what we want to watch.\nUm, do I want to watch this movie?\nNo.\nMaybe we'll have No.\nOh, yes.\nWait, I swiped right on that one.\nWait.\nSo, final destination.\nLet's swipe right on it.\nOkay.\nSo, I think after you swipe, it takes a couple of seconds uh for Or maybe it's going to wait until the game's over, the next one to to load.\nWhat if it waits until the game's over to like give us a list of the ones we swiped on?\nWell, I can already see that it does.\nI can already see the matches.\nYeah.\nOh, we can see all of our matches.\nThat's So, those are Yeah, I know we swiped.\nLet's just go through the list.\nI'll just We'll just go through swipe through the 30 because there gives us 30.\nUm Oh, see, cuz I'm on the previous one.\nYou have to wait until I get on the same one to start swiping on it.\nOh, see it's like kind of like smaller on your screen.\nBut now if we are on the same one now you're ready to swipe.\nOh, it's like made to be played at the same time to be played at the same time.\nNow you'll be able to swipe cuz you weren't able to swipe just now.\nRight.\nRight.\nRight.\nAnd we can see.\nSo let's swipe right.\nSo I'll swipe right.\nNow you see three max on the top right.\nYeah.\nWait.\nSo now like wait, let me see.\nSo if I try to swipe here, if I'm here, I can't.\nYou can't swipe this one.\nOh, so now now you can swipe.\nAmazing.\nThere you go.\nThis is cool.\nSo, we're we're both swiping.\nUm, this is insane.\nActually, this is so cool.\nLike, what is this?\n10 prompts vibe coding, you know?\nYeah.\nOr 11.\n10 to 20 prompts.\nIt looks like we're done with the room.\nSo, now you can press the matches.\nNow, we can see our matches.\nThey automatically open.\nSo, we have we have final destinations, which we kind of uh did ourselves.\nAnd then, oh, and also ranks it.\nSo, if we multiple people, we could see like everyone's matches.\nOh, we could create a room for like 10 people.\nYeah, that's sick.\nOkay, so back to home.\nNow we're now we're reset.\nAll right, let's put it on the app store.\nLet's get it.\nOkay, so this is perfect.\nI love the changes so far.\nSo, I've saved them in Cursor.\nI'll click on this git tab and then I'll click this plus button to save everything.\nThen I'll click this generate commit message button which will just generate a commit message for me.\nUm, sure that looks good.\nAnd I'll click commit and then push these changes.\nAnd now all these changes are synced to Vibe Code to your app.\nI mean they're always synced with Vibe Code without going through Git, but now with Git, you can make sure that they're saved forever.\nUm, so yeah, now it's time to get our app on the App Store.\nSo, I'm going to close all of these screens and I'm going to open the terminal.\nThe way I can do that is click the terminal button at the top here and click new terminal or I can click control and tilda together, which is this like shortcut, but I have the terminal open.\nAnd then I think the easiest way to get on the app store is to run this command called npx test flight or in our case bunx test flight.\nThey both do the same thing.\nUm, you might have npx installed, you might have bunx installed.\nThe way to figure that out is just to to run both of them.\nI have both installed.\nSo, I'm just going to use bunx test flight and then press enter.\nBut we probably want to get a home screen or sorry, an app icon for our home screen, a splash screen icon, right?\nUm, for our app, and then we also probably want to change the name of the app.\nSo, right now the app is called Vibe Code.\nSo all that data is inside this app.json file.\nSo right now the app is called vibe code.\nThe slug is vibe code.\nThe scheme is vibe code.\nUm so what we can do here is we can come here and change this to whatever we want.\nSo we can make this Movie Buddy.\nMake all of these movie buddies.\nUm and yeah that should be pretty pretty much it.\nThen we can generate an icon.\nSo we can go to chatgpt.\nCan you generate me an iOS app icon?\nUh, make it a square with no background and no rounded corners.\nUh, make it for an app called Movie Buddy.\nAnd make it a penguin who uh has 3D glasses on.\nYeah.\nAnd so, okay, so we have the name icon uh which is just like a square image with no background.\nYeah.\nUm, and then splash screen.\nYeah.\nSo you can just you can just make your splash screen be configured through the icon using expo.\nSo let me just read through the documentation here.\nIdeally we don't need to even worry about a splash screen.\nYou can just sort of use a the icon okay to do it.\nSo yeah we can see over here that you know this is the code again.\nWe'll put this in the in the um description below.\nBut I'm just going to copy this open Cursor.\nSo the icons are almost done.\nOh, they made four.\nIs that a new feature?\nYeah, it is a new feature.\nIt didn't remove the background, though.\nIt did not.\nI think it did.\nWhat's the red?\nDoes the red mean no background?\nI like I think this is perfect.\nOkay, let's use Yeah.\nWhich one do you like?\nUm, they all look kind of the same.\nThey do look the same.\nThis one looks good.\nJust use the one on the bottom right.\nI think we ship it.\nYeah.\nCool.\nCool.\nCool.\nSo, I will just drag that.\nAnd so, um I all I got to do is create a new folder here.\nSo, click this button, new folder, call it assets.\nAnd then I will just drag this into the assets or I guess I have to drag it to my downloads first and then I can drag it into assets.\nAnd then I will rename it to icon.png.\nPNG and then I'll create a new tab on Cursor and I will um say look at the documentation above and add the icon that I put into assets/icon.png as my icon for this app.\nUm also make it my splash screen for this app and just make my splash screen like whatever background color you want and then I will do at slash or at icon.png and it shows up there.\nSo I already said it's in assets icon.png.\nThat's all I really need to say and then it should be done.\nWow, it's crazy that this app like No, this is insane.\nThis is in mobile app.\nUm that has social features, right?\nLike you can use it with friends.\nYeah.\nThat has external datab like external API usage that is genuinely useful and fun.\nAnd we created it in less than an hour.\nYeah.\nAnd there's so many more features you could add.\nYou could add, you know, your ability to select the movies that you like swipe in and but like depending on how the review goes, like this could literally be on the App Store.\nYeah.\nIn 24 hours.\nYeah.\nThat's insane.\nThis is so cool.\nLike way more people should be creating apps on the App Store.\nIt's done.\nNow we can accept these changes.\nWe can close the Cursor chat and we can make the terminal bigger.\nSo this is the hardest part but also the easiest part depending on um what you think.\nSo I'll open a new terminal and type in bx test flight.\nOkay.\nSo you've added the icon and the splash screen.\nIt's just using the icon as a splash screen.\nNow we're opening the terminal and typing in some things.\nYeah.\nSo it's asking you need to install the following packages.\nJust click Y and it'll install the packages that it needs.\nOkay.\nSo now you're just kind of going through whatever test flight needs you to do and you're just doing through the terminal.\nAnd by the way, the in the description, we're going to put like a little PDF or uh written instructions on everything that uh we talked about today.\nUm, so that's super easy to follow um, in case you miss anything because there are a lot of steps to So now it's asking me to log in to EAS with my email or username.\nSo to make an account on EAS, you just go to expo.dev and then you make an account here.\nSo you just sort of make that account.\nUm, and I already have an account and so I'm just going to enter my username and password.\nOkay.\nSo, it's asking me would I like to automatically create a EAS project for Expo for um onandha/movbody.\nI'll type y.\nIt's creating it and then it's linking the local project to the ES project.\nAnd then it's asking me what would you like your iOS identifier to be?\nAnanda/mov movie ready sounds good.\nYou do need a website.\nThis is like in the reverse domain thing.\nYou can also just make up any anything here.\nBut um idly it's like a website that you own in like the reverse domain.\nSo I own anandanda\n\n\n.com.\n\nSo over here it's com.nandanda.\nMovie Buddy.\nBut you can also use something if no one owns it.\nYou don't need to buy a domain necessarily.\nBut if someone owns it, they might have um a app registered to that identifier.\nYeah.\nYou know, so just yeah, make sure you put that.\nAnd then iOS app only uses standard exempt encryption.\nClick yes for that.\nIf you don't know what this is, you likely should just click yes.\nAnd then it says created the project.\nDo you want to log into your Apple account?\nI'll click yes.\nEnter your Apple developer account to continue.\nI'll type in my username and password.\nOkay, cool.\nSo, it's asking me to sign in.\nI'll click device and then I'll put 543729.\nThere we go.\nIt's validating my code.\nI'll choose not number labs incorporated.\nUm, not number labs incorporated.\nA bunch of generate new Apple distribution certificate.\nYes to both.\nAnd then would you like to set push notifications?\nI don't need push notifications for this project.\nSo I'll click no.\nYou can also click yes.\nBut then Apple review will ask you why did you ask it if you don't need it.\nBut yeah, that's it.\nIt's done.\nWait, it's sent to Apple.\nIt's sent to Apple.\nOkay.\nSo it's sent to Apple and someone a human at Apple's going to review it.\nAnd depending on how that review goes, it could be on the app store.\nYeah.\nRight now it's being built.\nSo versions being built on an EAS which is like expose platform which takes some time.\nUh which takes like anywhere from like 5 to 20 minutes.\nUm and then it's and then so it's asking for some more generate a new app store connect key.\nI'll say yes.\nIt's like my submission progress.\nI can like open this and see what the progress is.\nI know it's cued.\nI can see the build.\nIt started less than a minute ago.\nThe first version and yeah it's just building.\nThis will take a little bit of time, but it should be done.\nAnd this super easy.\nIn theory, could if you, let's say, get rejected by the app store, could you just take what they said and paste it in Cursor and be like, &quot;Hey, this is the problem.\nCan you fix that?&quot;\nYeah, you can.\nYou can also paste into Vibe Code.\nBut yeah, you paste in Vibe Code and it'll and then you just do that until it gets accepted.\nYeah, for this app, I honestly probably don't even need to submit it to Apple.\nI feel like there are a lot of apps that you can use that you can just share with your friends or your family.\nshared it with me and like there's no need for me to go through that review process.\nNow I can like make updates and like instantly share them.\nYeah.\nAnd then maybe the move if you're trying to test it is to like literally use it with your friends and if everyone's like, &quot;Oh my god, this is a sick app now.\nYou have a validated app idea.&quot;\nYou could then go and get it in the App Store.\nThe the only real reason to get on the App Store is if you want to make money, right?\nRight.\nOtherwise, no need.\nThere's no need.\nYeah.\nUm but yeah, if you want to make money with this app, you want to sell it, um then definitely get on the App Store.\nAnd so in review today, we built an app using VibeCode App on our Phone, then uh once we felt like it was most of the way done, we got it most of the way done on Vibe Code, we used the new SSH feature, which allows you to sync the Vibe code with the Cursor code.\nAnd so when you make a change on Cursor, it'll also update on Vibe Code.\nAnd then we added the the what did we do on Cursor?\nWe so we added Firebase and Cursor and we added the TMDB API.\nWe added the TMDB API and then we put it on the App Store.\nYeah.\nAll of those things you could also do on Vibe Code or you could do all of this in Cursor.\nLike there's no real difference.\nI think each have their strengths.\nLike for example, in my opinion, it's way easier to get started on a project in Vibe Code cuz you don't have to set up the whole repository and all that stuff.\nYou don't have to deal with a terminal.\nAnd then it's way easier to add like backend features and Cursor cuz Firebase Cursor you have you need Cursor to get it on the actual App Store.\nYeah.\nTo run this lost command, you do need Cursor.\nSo yeah, that's that's basically and you're probably somewhat technical if you're if you're using Cursor a lot.\nAnd so it's good to get the option to just like okay you have one while you're like at a coffee shop you can build an app with your voice and then as soon as you get back plug it into Cursor realtime sync gives you full optionality on what you want to use.\nYeah.\nSo I can go in my builds and 9 minutes later or 7 minutes and 36 seconds later this build is done.\nUm, I can also go to the submissions tab and I can see that this is now being submitted to App Store for review.\nUm, and so this should be done in a few seconds as well.\nThen I can go to App Store Connect um, and I'll be able to find this app.\nAmazing.\nOkay.\nSo, in the actual Apple interface, which is App Store Connect, you'll be able to see the app that you created on Cursor and not in.\nYeah.\nSo, I create click apps and then it should pop up here.\nThere we go.\nMovie Buddy, we're ready.\nLet's go.\nThe build is still um submitting, so it'll be done soon.\nBut yeah, it should automatically submit to Testlite.\nSo, you should find it on your phone if you download the Testlite app.\nIf you don't, you can you can come here, you can click team and you can see your team um and then add add um people to your team to make sure that they get the app.\nBut yeah, that's pretty much it.\nIt's on the App Store.\nIt less than an hour and um we started on Vibe Code and went through Cursor and this is Movie Buddy.\nNow we have Movie Buddy and an app that we can both use at the same time and we can swipe.\nI left the the room.\nYou left the room?\nYeah, you left me alone.\nI can't do anything now.\nAll right, well that was the episode.\nUh, subscribe if you like videos like these and uh we'll see you here for the next one.\n",
