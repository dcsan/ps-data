  "cleanText": "Three of the biggest trends in the world of AI over the past two years have been AI automations, AI agents, and vibe coding. And we're going to be using 10 of the top AI tools in the world in one central platform that brings vibe coding, automation, and AI agents together. Today, I'm talking to Fabian Stellzer, the founder of Glif, and we are going to be using Glif to create AI workflows that can help you grow or start your business. We're also going to build multi-step workflows that help my content team. We're going to talk about how to use these workflows in vibe coded apps. And we're going to see a live demo that will allow you to create an AI agent that has access to all of the workflows you create, which will make powerful AI agents accessible and easy to use. Let's just dive in. All right, I'm going to show you how to build an automated meme generator. This is an example one I've made. It's been run like almost 90,000 times. So, it lets Claude take your input and figure out what a good meme would look like and then it generates the classic format that we all know and love. So, this is on glif.app where you can build these sorts of workflows very easily and the basic idea is that you're playing with AI Legos. We have a bunch of different types of blocks and I'm going to go through them one by one and then we're going to sort of upgrade this workflow to be a bit more fun. Now the way Glif works is that you usually want to start with one of these input blocks, right? You can send stuff into it via API, but it's also something that like you can test on Glif or have others like use it on Glif. It's going to show up in the native Glif UI basically for these workflows. Like you want some type of input that your user is going to put in. And that is at this point like we we have like text inputs which is just a prompt. You can use image inputs. You can have like a multi-pick which basically lets you the user has like this drop down where they can choose from. Right? We're not going to do it here, but this is just an example. I'm going to take this workflow here. I'm going to make a remix and we're going to make an audio version of it. We'll delete this text input and we'll replace it with an audio input. That's going to give us this like little audio interface for folks to upload stuff. Now, in order for this to work, we need to add a separate step, which is we're going to go audio to text and we're going to plug our audio input in there. So, Glif works with these variables, right? It's technically more like a spreadsheet than a note-based sort of thing. So, you add these variables and we can just click on that one. It's going to sort of take the audio input, plug it into our audio to text. And we're going to call this one input one as that's what it's called in the rest of the workflow. And now this gets piped into a text block, right? And that's part of the sort of generator suite. So you've got text generators where we have tons and tons of LLMs. We have image generators where you've got Flux, stable diffusion, deli, GPT image. We're just about to add image 4 which is awesome. Then you have a full Comfy UI environment if that's your jam. So you can build pretty sophisticated comfy workflows, add them here. If you don't know what that is, never mind. You don't need it. If you know what it is, it's really powerful. You can add like audio generators, generate speech, music, sound effects, this audio to text thing, which we just used to change our text input to an audio one. And now this here gets turned into text. Then it gets piped into this block here, which is clot 3.5 set. I'm actually going to upgrade this to clot 4. I'm going to go with opus because it's new. Nice. You you added opus. We added opus. Yeah. So, we're going to add cla opus um to put it to good use in simulating virgin versus chat memes, right? So, you have the ability here to add a system prompt where we're giving you like broad context on what it's supposed to do and a regular prompt. And in this case, I have it generate JSON. And I think you went over this in one of your previous tutorials. JSON is this really useful format for generating structured outputs. And you'll see in a second why we want structured outputs. Basically, I'm having it generate these individual pieces of the meme, right? I'm giving it an example here so it knows how that's going to look like. We've got like five quotes for the virgin and five quotes for our chat. I think the best way to think about it, the same way that your audio input, the output of your audio input was a variable, you're basically taking one single AI response and turning it into 10 different variables that you can use later on individually so that you can deterministically place those variables wherever you want them on a later step in the canvas. Exactly. And this is what's happening here in this JSON block. Right. So, we've got a bunch more slightly sort of utilitarian blocks like we've got a text combiner where you can combine text like you have multiple prompts you want them in one text box or you want to just add a readme use text combiner or use this JSON extractor which will basically let you do this where we can add like the inputs that we want and in this we send we're sending the JSON that Claude Opus is going to generate for us and then we split it up D into multiple variables that we can then use on one of the output blocks. So for output, we've got HTML where you can write HTML code or VIP code HTML code. And we have this canvas which is pretty straightforward where I basically just uploaded the chat versus virgin meme format. And I'm just like adding these here. That's it. Right? And because I for this one I like it to look amateurish. I'm making sure that some are bold, some aren't. So, you know, it doesn't look as automated, basically. Let's run it. We've got an audio input, right? So, I'm going to I'm going to just go I'm going to allow VIP coder versus senior staff engineer. So, I'm going to run this and we can see how it's going to go through these little steps. So, whisper turns it into text and now Opus is turning it into a meme. This is the first time I'm testing Opus on memes, actually. So, I'm curious how it's going to do. And there we go. We have our meme. So virgin senior staff engineer versus chat vip coder. So it's kind of fun that that's the beauty of LLMs, right? Like Opus groed that obviously the vibe coder is the chat in this context and senior stuff engineer is the virgin has strong opinions about semicolons and tap with whereas wipe coder variable names vibes saw the thing with message 10x engineer because uses ChatGPT for everything solves po incidents while having mushrooms that's what it's like 100% hasn't shipped code in three years only reviews Ouch. So, yeah, that's the beauty of Glif that you can make these kinds of workflows. I'm I'm a huge fan of memes. I remixed one of these and I turned it into a productive workflow. Let me share my screen real quick because I created one for all of my YouTube videos. Let me see here. I have my glyphs saved here. So, this is creating a thumbnail design. Whenever I do this, I always go into edit and let me zoom in and make sure you can see it. So, right here, this is this is my flow. And the one thing that I think the biggest and so I'm going to change this to uh to Opus. One thing that I did on here is I'm actually using a PDF that I uploaded to GitHub. So on GitHub, if you just upload a PDF, you can actually turn it to a public PDF that Claude can use for examples. So Claude can actually ingest full PDFs. For example, if we were to just go to this link, it will actually show us exactly what it's seeing. And so you can see here it just automatically downloaded this. And that's basically what it's doing in this workflow is it's going to look at a ton of highquality examples of YouTube thumbnails and titles. It'll go through pages. There's pages of these. And so I'm giving Claude access to highquality examples. And then what we're doing is we're saying you are a helpful assistant that analyzes packaging which are titles and thumbnails paired together. And again, since I forked your meme generator, I just made I basically created the same workflow where it's going to output 10 different variables. And these are separated in the JSON parser. So we have title 1 through 5 and then thumbnail image 1 through 5. And then this goes through individual image generation for the five. And so it's like thumbnail image for your YouTube video. This should be a high quality thumbnail of this variable right here. And so it's going to and the input the input I skipped over this. The input is just notes about my idea. And so the more you put the better it's going to do because whatever makes your episode unique, it'll pick that up and then it will look at all those examples and create high-quality thumbnails and titles. And then it's going to go through that five different times. And then it's going to throw everything onto a canvas just like your meme generator. And so let's go ahead and run this. And this will take a little bit longer, I think, cuz it's actually generating the images where yours had deterministic images. They were automatically placed there. So, it will take a little bit longer, but this is fun. Let's say a a complete uh guide to vibe coding, how to build apps with natural language using AI where we built an app in 90 seconds and made $5,000. We're just coming up with something random. And then you can run this Glif. And it's kind of fun because you can kind of just follow along and see where it is. And so you can see that it's obviously finished the input step. And now it's going through this text step. And so right now it's analyzing the PDF basically and generating 10 based on my idea while using the PDF that I showed you earlier as examples. And now it's generating the images. And this is the longest step. Unfortunately, OpenAI's API can take a little bit. But what I didn't realize is that these are all generating at the same time. Like any step that can be done in parallel is going to be done in parallel. Any step that's sequential because it's depending on another one is going to have to wait for the generation to be done. Amazing. Yeah, that's huge. And so yeah, these are all generating at the same time. And the reason I like to go in this edit field, and this is something that I asked you about, it would be cool if you could make the output have the images as well as separate images. Because in this field, if you if you just run uh like right now, we're in the edit view where you can edit. And this is cool because I can actually copy all of the outputs for all of them or save them to my computer. So, this is like where I do the work. Yeah. I mean, so the there's some changes coming to the API where it will support multi out. For now, there's a little hack that you can use that I'm going to show you. So if you if you go to your workflow and you add a a text combiner at the very last step.\n[Music]\nOh. Oh. But after the canvas. Yeah. Like the canvas is cool because it's going to sort of put them all together so you get an overview, right? Which is useful. But if you by API want the individual image URLs, then just add a text combiner. And what you could what you could do is you could just like do some JSON here where you say like you know curly brackets uh image one and then I don't even know how to write in JSON. I've only ever had AI write in got you got to vibe code it. But the basic idea would be that you've got like so if you if you look down there you've got image one, image two, image three, image four, image five. Those are images but they're image URLs. If you just like click on them, it's going to give you all of these as the sort of final step output of the API call for this individual Glif. And then you can just like pull those images and do with them whatever you want. Wait, so where would the canvas go in this workflow? Like would the output be in this in this world? So it depends on how you want to use this, right? Like if you want to use this just in Glif and you want to see everything on one image, then you want to have that canvas as your last step. But if if what you want is to get these individual images in like some vibe coded app then what you need is ideally um both the canvas actually you could put the canvas on render the canvas you could put the canvas so you would do a JSON output of all the images and the canvas and then you just plug those into the output of the app. Okay, great. I want to come back to this. We'll talk about this. I want to show the output because I think this is pretty solid. So this is one of the most important things about a YouTube video. like after this video, like I'll spend an hour, an hour and a half with my team thinking about how we want to package this episode. And it's it's hard to initially come up with ideas, but once you have a few ideas, it's a lot easier to be like, &quot;Okay, we can do that, but we'll tweak it.&quot; And so, like my main page that I have is this. So, now I have five decent ideas. It's like the complete guide to vibe coding, build AI apps with just words, $5,000 in 24 hours. And we can zoom in here and we can see that these are like pretty good, you know, and they're not always perfect, but they always give me ideas. And then I can very easily go to the OpenAI API or OpenAI and ask it to like edit them. And I can also send this cuz I have a YouTube thumbnail guy and I can send them examples. I'm like, make it like this except change this. And so we create five different examples. And then if we like any of them individually, like let me show you. I can save this. So, I'm just going to save this image. Let's go ahead and call it vibe coding Riley. And one of the APIs that I wish you would add, I found this uh it's called Seagmind face swap v4. Let me try and find a good face swapper on Glif. And you can put that step right in there. It\n\n\nAmazing.\nI would love to throw a face swap in.\nI'm pretty sure this thing you're using is using the inside face one, and these guys don't give out commercial licenses.\nSo, we never, we weren't able to get one, but I think a lot of folks just ignore it.\nOkay, this is a really bad image of me, but I just create, I created this before the episode.\nAnd you can just drag in your face into here.\nAnd if you go into the, I actually like the uh, the swap type.\nWhere's style?\nOh, yeah.\nHere we go.\nStyle is the way it's better.\nAnd this one takes like 20 seconds.\nI did a bunch of testing on these in case I actually just wanted a last-minute thumbnail, and I had to use one of these thumbnails.\nAnd they don't do that bad because it has examples of good thumbnails.\nI have some improvement ideas for your workflow.\nYeah, let's hear it.\nIf you send it to me, I can remix it, and I'll show you.\nAmazing.\nLet's do that.\nOne thing that's really cool is you can actually share these workflows with your team.\nAnd this is something that we're doing uh because our team's growing.\nSo, I want other people to have access.\nAnd it's really easy.\nYou just click share.\nAnd then I'm going to go to Twitter and send it to you.\nAnd then you're going to pull it up, and you're going to remix it.\nAnd you can make these private or public.\nIf they're public, then anyone can remix them.\nAnd I think that's just really cool.\nIt allows me to find other people's workflows, and I can remix them.\nThis is a remix from a meme generator.\nSo, it's great.\nLet's make some improvements to your VIP marketing workflow.\nSo, I'm going to hit here for remix.\nOkay, so I've remixed Riley's thumbnail ideator because I want to add some cool extra feature, which is basically, so you have like this is the main step, right?\nSo, this is cloth on it, and it's basically analyzing the PDF of yours, and it's going to sort of come up with these ideas for thumbnails.\nAnd what we're going to do is we're going to add an extra step where we adding another LLM.\nSo, we have a bunch of them here.\nWhat I want to be adding specifically is Perplexity because we're going to add like some online research to the whole thing.\nSo, I can add Perplexity Llama 3.1 Sonar 70B.\nHere, I'm going to call this one research.\nI'm going to say you're an online researcher working for a YouTube creator, and you'll be researching stuff online for them, or we're just going to say just so they have current context on the series of videos that they are creating.\nAnd I'm going to say research this topic, and we're going to plug in your input.\nRight?\nSo if you, if you like whatever input you put in here, it's going to go in there.\nWe can give it a few more tokens to work with.\nLet's say a thousand output tokens.\nAnd now we have this extra step research.\nAnd what we can do is now we go to this here.\nHere is the users video idea.\nInput one.\nOur research team found additional context that may be relevant.\nAnd now I'm just going to hit research.\nAnd that's going to plug in this generated step.\nAnd if we now sort of run this again, we're going to do current LLM jailbreaks.\nNow it's going to run this step first, right?\nAnd so we get the power of Perplexity's online stuff.\nSo it's going to be a bit more current.\nWe're working around the context cutoff or the knowledge cutoff issues that even the latest LMS will always have.\nThis is something that I don't think enough people uh take into account with the current AI models is the fact that prior to adding this step when we put in our idea for the video, all it has is my idea obviously, and then it has all of the different examples, but it doesn't have all of the current culture and knowledge and new, cuz when we say vibe coding, right?\nIf I put in make a video about vibe coding about building an app with AI, it actually doesn't fully understand, it doesn't have proper context around what vibe coding means, what people are doing with vibe coding, what popular apps are surrounded by vibe coding.\nAnd so this step will actually allow Claude, because the following step will be Claude.\nIt'll allow Claude to have that additional information.\nAnd that's how Claude might actually come up with the best memes or the best uh YouTube thumbnail, and it might reference something that is popular in culture.\nAnd this is just very important.\nAnd this is how people are uh writing scripts like the most relevant scripts for social media especially.\nIt's very important to give it internet access.\nAnd I'm assuming that maybe adding the Grock API because Grock just added search like their to their search API, like you could even pull from Twitter directly.\nAnd so there's a lot of different ways to get context.\nThis is super cool.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd one of the inputs that Claw generated got flagged by OpenAI, so not all of them went through.\nAnd I think it's because there was like some mention of jailbreaks, but that's all right.\nWe got, we got a few of them.\nAnd um but yeah, exactly.\nSo that's the, that's the kind of step that gives it the context to have things that it may not have had in his training data because vibe coding is new.\nClaude doesn't know about vibe coding yet.\nAnd yeah, what you said about Grock and um real time access to all the tweets on X is going to be pretty awesome.\nSo we're going to definitely add that.\nAnother thing that might be cool showing is you can add other glyphs inside of your glyph.\nI don't know if you know that.\nSo for example, I have a glyph called get random Vicki.\nSo if I just run this, this is using a block called the web fetcher with which you can call any API, and I'm calling a thing on Valtown that just gives me a random Wikipedia article.\nLet's say we want to add some randomness to your workflow, some entropy.\nWhat we could do is we could go in here and add another block, and we're going to use a glyph block.\nAnd with that glyph block, we can just paste the URL of the glyph that we want.\nGet random Vicki is now in here.\nI'm going to call this, can you show, can you show what you pasted?\nWhere did you get that code that you just pasted in there?\nIt's just this sort of little piece here.\nThat's the ID.\nAnd but also the URL will work.\nTechnically, it just needs this ID.\nAnd so you put that in here.\nThere's a bunch of like presets in here as well that are quite useful, right?\nLike extract text from website or prompt, etc., etc.\nBut most of the time, I'm just going to use it for like stuff that I've made like another workflow I want to plug into um another workflow.\nAnd so now we've got random vici, and this is probably not super useful for this particular workflow, but for many it will be, right?\nAnd so here we could now go and be like also be inspired by this random thought you just had.\nLet's suppose you want to generate like wild ideas.\nWhat's the problem with LLMs and wild ideas is even though they're kind of not deterministic, they sort of are, right?\nAnd one of my favorite tricks is to just plug in random Wikipedia text, right?\nLike you can just run this, and it's going to just pull random bits of stuff from Wikipedia.\nSo now we've got the Braggs law, also known as Wolf Bracks condition.\nSo that's going to sort of, you know, pull it into a different direction.\nAnd what I like to do is I like to just like include that and tell it last night you may have dreamt this, you can ignore it.\nThat's going to be enough to let's say you, you have a workflow where you need this bit of entropy.\nIt's going to sort of pull it into different directions.\nIt's going to make it more creative.\nCool trick.\nAnd uh yeah, at the same time, of course, an example of how you can like just take any, any other glyph and put it inside of your glyph.\nThat's very interesting cuz you're right.\nI've tried to get AI to create things at random.\nAnd you're right, it will kind of predictably come up with things that are random, and it doesn't really help the workflow.\nThat's very interesting.\nI've never heard of that where like you dreamt this last night, but don't worry about it.\nIt's very similar to one guy I met in San Francisco tells cursor, the cursor agent, like in its cursor rules that he is uh a mixture between Rick and Morty and then one character from Silicon Valley.\nI forget which character from Silicon Valley.\nIt's like you are this person, and then it's like in last night you did this activity, but it doesn't really matter that much.\nNow write your output, and it's output's way more concise, and you can find little ways to like get it to act in a certain way, like where you change where it's looking in the uh training data, and it's really fun.\nSo that's a very useful trick.\nI'm trying to think of other ways that you could use glyphs within a glyph, glyphception.\nUm and uh yeah.\nYeah, I feel like my mind is going crazy.\nFor example, what you could do is let's make a glyph that is basically using GPT image for face swap.\nRight?\nNow, the way we would do this is like we need two images, right?\nLike one is our target image.\nWe're going to call this target, and this one we're going to call face, and then we're going to add an image generator at this step, and we're going to pick GPT image by OpenAI.\nWe're going to advance controls.\nAnd there we can do image URLs or blocks that return images separate with new lines.\nAnd so we're going to put face and then new line target.\nAnd I'm going to call this GPT face swap.\nAnd I'm going to publish this.\nAnd now we have to write a prompt, right?\nAnd we're going to try something very simple where we basically say take the person from the first image and replace, take the person and face from the first image and replace the face on the second image with that one.\nKeep everything else exactly the same.\nAnd we're going to test this now.\nThen you're going to plug this into the other workflow, right?\nYeah.\nAnd you know what?\nI'm going to grab my face from here, and we're just going to test it with this one.\nSo, I'll just like paste the URL here.\nThat's the face.\nAnd then I'm going to, I'm going to go to your workflow here.\nAnd we're going to copy this image and paste it here.\nThat's good to know that you can just paste this image URLs.\nThat's cool.\nShould be working.\nAnd now we're going to run this glyph.\nAnd let's see if that's going to work because I feel like, yeah, sometimes GPT image can do these face swaps reasonably well.\nThey're not perfect, but they're fine.\nWe might want to sort of adjust the the output size to match our target image because now it's going to generate a square one, and obviously it's GPT image, so it's going to take take its sweet time to do that.\nWe could also, let me see, I have another, I have another face swapper in here.\nSo I'll just like take my face again and put it in here.\nAnd if that one works, we can just also use this one.\nI'm going to copy this image address and put it in here.\nAnd we're just going to say some additional context YouTube thumb.\nNow, this one is using like a comfy workflow that's actually quite complicated because it sort of detecting the image on the target, the t, the face on the target image, masks that then runs like an inside face, not the face swapper, but another sort of similarish um algorithm.\nAnd we can see now it's the sort of comfy flow.\nAnd while that's running, let's check in on our on the GPT one and see if that one worked.\nSo, that kind of did kind of work, right?\nYes, we need to, we need to adjust it for landscape, and then we can run it again.\nBut can you try with my, my face on Twitter?\nOf course.\nSo, we're going to go grab your face.\nSo, going to go here.\nCopy image address.\nAnd I think it was here.\nNo.\nOkay.\nSo, that's the other one.\nThat is the other one.\nThat's great.\nUh, so obviously like this one is messing up the rest because we're looking at like a stable diffusion based workflow, but so I think, I think this here will be much better.\nAnd we're going to sort of drop your face here.\nAnd then we're going to grab one of these again.\nI think this one was fine.\nLet's see.\nAnd now we add this as our target.\nSo we're putting my face on one of the images that we generated in my workflow.\nOkay, correct.\nSo now this is going to run and usually takes like 30 seconds GPT image.\nHey, there we go.\nThat's not bad actually.\nIt's not bad.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBasically, you would take this ID, right?\nAnd you could say, hey, I'm going to take one of these and in the end add like a glyph block, right?\nAnd then add this particular workflow we've made, and we have like lift again.\nAnd then it's going to sort of perform the the face swap on your on the generated ones.\nAnd uh it's going to be a very sort of GPT heavy workflow in terms of like, you know, just credits and and image image gen.\nBut uh it's worth it.\nI think it's pretty cool.\nYeah.\nI mean as someone building a startup and we're trying to create so much content at scale, like it's definitely worth it for us to just create these models, like if we were to do that face swap step, you know, if sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't, I would probably have it just do five different outputs so we have five options.\nSo, so ChatGPT's every step it has five chances, and since they run in parallel, it doesn't take any additional time.\nI take a few seconds because it's you have to wait for the one that takes the longest.\nBut I think it's really cool to get a ton of options for things.\nAnd I think AI is really good for ideation.\nAnd so one of my favorite things about creating workflows is just creating a ton of options that allows your team or for you to like get to the final output the quickest.\nI just want to talk about how you can actually turn this into a vibe-coded app because we've actually done this on the vibe code app.\nI made a video on Twitter where I took the meme generator, and I think the the the hook was Greg Eisenberg at the beginning, like I took a photo of Greg, and then I, I had the im, the input was an image, the um an image and a description of the person, and then the output was one of those memes of that person where um and it and it was really funny, and I plugged it into the app, and I basically just asked cursor to do it cuz I've never written a line of code in\n\n\nMy life, and it worked pretty well.\nI had to, like, battle with it maybe two or three iterations, but it worked after that.\nAnd so, you want to talk about that?\nTotally.\nYeah.\nSo, so this one is cool, right?\nSo this is a Glif I just made.\nThis is a workflow that generates LM Studio like podcasts, right?\nSo, it takes a topic, you tell it how many turns, and those are the two inputs, and it's sort of running it through Claude, GPT-4 mini, and then two audio blocks that generate two different speakers with 11 labs.\nAnd then it's generating these types of, like, little podcasts.\nIf we were to run this via the API, you just basically want to go to this little button here, run via API, and that's going to give you a curl that you can just, like, literally paste to cursor winds or Vibe Code app, and it'll know what to do with it, right?\nLike, you'll have to get a, you click through to this page to get an API token, right?\nThat's your little password secret that you also need to include in your app.\nMake sure it doesn't leak.\nThis is not the Vibe Coder friendly version yet.\nI think there's another version going out where you just get, like, a piece of text that you can paste into whatever Vibe coding app you're using, and that's going to have all the context that the LLM needs to then integrate this Glif into your app.\nI want to make sure everyone understands how valuable this is because if you went to cursor and you're like, I want to create an app that allows me to put in my idea and then it would you, uh, and then we're going to use Perplexity to search the internet and do research on this thing and go through all these different steps and then create this LLM, uh, this, uh, kind of notebook LM style podcast as an output, it would be a nightmare.\nMaybe you'll get cursor to set it up once.\nBut what happens when you actually want to modify it as a vibe coder?\nEven as a programmer, it would be annoying to, like, go through those workflows and and and and go through the code files and manually change the variables.\nSo the reason why I think the marriage between no-code automation and vibe coding is going to be so powerful is because it allows you to fully test this backend.\nAnd I think over time, it's only going to get easier to add these backend workflows directly into your app.\nAnd so it's just one API call.\nIt just looks at what the inputs are and gets the output.\nAnd so it doesn't matter how many steps are in between.\nYou can add as many steps as you want, and you can just test them right there.\nSo you nail the backend.\nAnd so now when I'm making apps, I'm using Glif.\nI'm like in there creating these workflows and seeing what the input output is like.\nAnd then and then I think, okay, how would should this work on the Vibe Code app, right?\nLike, how could I make this show up in a way that makes it the most, like, it completes the experience in a way that would be fun or it would go viral?\nIt could rank number one on the app store.\nUm, that's kind of how I've kind of changed my thinking around creating these fun workflows.\nTotally.\nYeah.\nI mean, there there's, like, there's this, like, special place for a somewhat deterministic workflow where, especially when you're kind of, like, dealing with AI models, right?\nLike, not having to have six different API keys is kind of neat, right?\nSo, and, like, being able to know, okay, I've set this up in a way where I'm, like, really happy with it.\nAnd you might sort of find that you want, like, a different voice here, right?\nSo, you just pick, like, a different voice.\nI like Jeremy and I like, um, Charlotte.\nYou might like another voice.\nAnd then for the sort of script writing, you might want something more unhinged.\nSo, you basically can go in here and be, you can basically say, like, well, look, like, these podcasts are, like, truly unhinged.\nThey're, like, more comedy stage than regular podcasts.\nSo, you just change it here.\nYou run it.\nYou test it until you're happy.\nAnd once you're happy with this workflow, you just do this last step, and you get, like, everything you need to plug it into your app, into your sort of, like, front end that you've created.\nAnd obviously, yeah, you're just only using one API key for it.\nAnd it makes it, yeah, that makes it so much easier to not have to get, like, 10 different APIs.\nYes.\nYes.\nThere's workflows, there's apps, and then the third thing is agents.\nAnd I think the key difference between, like, a workflow and an agent is that an agent, instead of having this one thing that it always just goes through step by step, agents decide themselves what to run, when to run it.\nAnd you just basically set up an agent and give it a bunch of tools.\nAnd so in this world, like, the Glifs become individual tools that are used by the agents.\nAnd so one fun agent I've made for myself is Clawberg.\nAnd Claudeberg is my Bloomberg terminal replacement.\nAnd the way it works is that I go, \"Hey, Clotber, let's find some unique opportunities for stocks to short this week.\"\nAnd, um, so what Clotber will do, it has, like, a custom UI that I've wipe coded, and it'll check the date.\nIt'll say, \"Good to see you again, Fabian.\nLet me scan the landscape first.\"\nThen it's running a tool called basic internet search.\nSo it's learning about stuff that's been happening.\nGeopolitical tensions running high.\nLet me dig deeper.\nLet me see what's moving.\nSo you can give, you can give these agents access to tools as well as Glifs as tools.\nIt has access to Glifs, but because Glif can access any other thing, in this case, the basic internet search is a Glif.\nIt's a Glif with Perplexity.\nGot it.\nAnd now, so it's identifying Palenteer is interesting.\nSo it's generating for me these artifacts that are visualizing the stock data.\nThis is HTML.\nWow.\nWow.\nThat's insane.\nAnd so it's going through, as you can see, like, all I did is I said, \"Hey, let's find some unique opportunities for stocks to short.\"\nAnd so it's going through all of these, and then it's generating this report where it says, like, primary short is Palencia.\nSecondary short is Lulu, Lululemon.\nAnd those are the recommendations it came up with.\nAnd I can go through these, check out.\nIt also has, like, super micro computer inc, but seems like it doesn't want me to short that one.\nAnd now the cool thing is that we've made it, like, extremely easy to make these agents.\nI've got one that's called Longevity Genius, which I quite like because I can just go and say, \"Hey, can you research what are some hot new supplements for brain health and generate a podcast on them?\"\nAnd so this, this guy here is going to go and use its skills, as we call it in that context.\nSo it's going to run web search with Perplexity four times.\nThen it's going to sort of take that knowledge.\nI've uncovered some fascinating developments.\nLet me create a podcast that dives Steve into these topics, and now it's running a skilled generate and play podcast.\nRight now, that's going to take a while because it's, like, generating all the speech and everything.\nThe idea is you've got the workflows on one side, and then you have the agents on the other side, and they are using the workflows.\nAnd we've all seen Manis and, like, Genpark super agent, etcetera, etcetera, and they're cool.\nThey're great products, but I don't want to live in a world where we're all using the same three agents.\nLike, I think everyone should have their own agent or multiple agents, and it should be, like, as easy making it an agent as it is to write a prompt, basically.\nRight.\nYeah.\nAnd so this, this is insane.\nThis is actually, this is really exciting because I think, you know, like, someone watching this, right, they saw me create this YouTube thumbnail workflow, and they're like, oh, it would probably take time to create the YouTube workflow, and then maybe I have an Instagram workflow, and maybe I have a script writing workflow, but you can basically take all of the workflows that you create on here and basically give them access to one singular agent.\nSo, I could have a content creation agent.\nCorrect.\nOr, or I could just have a Vibe Code app marketing agent that has access to all these different workflows, and then any new hire that we bring on, it could have access to the way that we think.\nI want people to understand why we're doing certain things, and you can actually include that in the output, whether you do that through HTML code or canvas, like, features.\nBut you're basically centralized.\nMe just, you can just type YouTube thumbnail with the idea of blank because basically the, the central agent is actually just deciding what to input into the Glif, sort of, right?\nOkay, cool.\nAnd so here now this guy just went, like, the four times Perplexity search, uncovering some interesting new directions for brain health, and then it generated a podcast that you can listen to here with a microphone here.\nSo, I've been hearing this term everywhere lately, vibe coding.\nLike, literally every, yeah, you get the point.\nIt's like a sort of that one is deterministic.\nIt's not vibe coding it.\nLike, it knows how the structure of that HTML is going to look like, and it's going to sort of run this sort of thing to generate the podcast and to play it, and you can download the episode.\nAnd yeah, and so basically, you can, like, go and also, like, we have some stuff like Tik Tok studio, which is a fun one, or you can go in and be like, so that one's going to generate, I think, brain rot if I go and say, hey, let's first do five images on spooky castles of the world, and it's going to go and run, like, it has access to this tool, which is called, so I've made a tool called fast Tik Tok image, which is just using flux schnell to generate these, like, crappy, sloppy AI castles.\nNow it's running them all, and now I can go, sweet, let's turn this into a podcast and then a video.\nAnd so now it knows I've got access to generate podcast version two, I've got access to create Tik Tok video, and so the first thing it's going to do is going to sort of generate the audio part, and then it's going to run this other Glif, which is generating the Tik Tok videos.\nAnd so you can see where this is going.\nSo it's basically the sort of, like, hyperpersonalized agent that has access to the specific tools that you or your marketing team or your colleagues or your family or your kids want to use, and then it decides itself when to use which skill, as we call them.\nThey're just tools.\nThey're Glifs.\nWe're calling them skills in this context when they're used by the, by the Glif agents.\nUm, is awesome.\nI genuinely, like, I think this is such an ideal interface for Glifs.\nI think having a bunch of different pages open can be kind of intimidating, and so if you want to create a workflow, but, like, this is just a chat interface that many people are used to.\nYes, it will take some time to set up, but, like, that's the fun part for a lot of people who want to dig in and actually personalize these workflows.\nAnd it's worth it, right?\nIf you're doing anything creative, if you're, and you want to do it repeatedly, like, it's worth the time to get your hands dirty.\nAnd you can always start with other people's Glifs as well.\nLike, you can remix people's Glifs.\nMaybe you only need to alter it a little bit.\nAnd so that's a really interesting way of creating these, like, mini apps.\nI really cool.\nI, I'm very excited.\nWhen can, uh, people expect this to drop?\nThis is basically in the final stages of testing, and we're going to open it up very sooning.\nDays, not weeks.\nAmazing.\nAmazing.\nLet's go.\nI'm excited.\nI'll, I'll send you the thing that it's generating here because they're quite, it's generating, it's generating a video.\nAnd so the thing, the way it's set up is, like, this guy.\nIt literally has as it prompt, you're helping folks create all kinds of content using various tools.\nUse a bunch of images per video, not just one.\nAnd that's it.\nYou can obviously go much more sophisticated on that.\nBut this is the only prompt it has.\nPlus, it has, like, access to these, like, tools.\nAnd this is really what makes it kind of, like, understand, especially when you're using, I think, like, this one's using Claude 4, like, these brains, they're also just Glifs.\nSo you're running a Glif as its brain essentially, and then you have, like, yeah, you can, like, change the theme while we're waiting for this to, we're going to go YouTuber theme, use gradients, and those, uh, agents, they're going to get an API as well.\nSo once you have an agent, and that can be a personality.\nSo say, say you've made, you've really crafted a personality that is extremely unique in how it chats, then again, same thing, single button, turn this into a chat app.\nAnd so it's kind of like, you basically get full access to the agent, and then you make your own front end for it in Vibe Code app, or you make, like, a specific type of setup where it's like, hey, actually, anytime I just press this button on my, on my vibe coded app, I want the agent to do this at Vibe Code.\nHey, once you release this, we're going to make it as easy as possible to integrate it with the Vibe Code app so you can create these experiences on Mobile App and get them on the app store because I think AI agent-based tools like these are going to crush on the app store, like, genuinely, because you know, the current apps are, are quite dumb, you know, especially on the app store, and I think we're going to go through this period where, like, people are going to create much cooler apps that can do a lot more creative things, and I definitely think that this is the interface that to, like, create them.\nI think this is great from, like, a vibe coder's perspective is you just create the workflows and you get it deterministically to run well.\nNot deterministically, but, like, you get it to, you know, 98% of the time it's doing what you want it to do, and then you're like, you know what, this is a super useful workflow.\nAnd since you have so much customizability, you can embed your knowledge, right?\nYou can embed your what you've learned in any given domain and include them in a PDF reference somewhere.\nAnd maybe that's the secret sauce to make it work.\nAnd you can turn that into an app, and you can monetize it.\nI'm super excited for you guys.\nLike, this is a really cool tool.\nSend you some examples.\nLike, it gives you this, like, classic YouTube, Tik Tok style with, like, um, subtitles and everything.\nBut yeah, that's the, that's the vibe of it.\nAnd yeah, I think it's going to be really, it's going to be really cool.\nLike, you can do entire games, like, agent.\n\n\n-based games basically.\nIt's going to be interesting.\nAmazing.\nWell, thank you so much for coming on.\nThis was super fun.\nSuper excited for the agent tool.\nLet me know the day it comes out.\nI will be testing it, probably make a video on it and maybe create some vibecoded stuff with it.\nAnd yeah, appreciate you coming on 100%.\nWell, yeah, this is a really in-depth look at Glif.\nAnd I think once you kind of learn the interface, like you'd be surprised at how many cool use cases you come up with.\nWhat I've always found with vibe coding, with tools like Glif, like no code automation, you come up with more ideas the longer you use them.\nIt's hard to come up with ideas, but after you create one workflow, you're like, \"Oh, wait.\nI could do that workflow, but for this.\nOh, for this.\nAnd before you know it, you have 10 different workflows.\nAnd then I just save these as bookmarks.\nAnd just anytime you need a thumbnail, I just go to my thumbnail Glif.\nI just type it in.\nI just type my idea.\nNow I have five ideas.\nNow we're rocking and rolling.\nNow I can send it to my editor and say create two or uh three thumbnails similar to this with these titles.\nAnd yeah, I'm going to slowly build out every decision that we make as a marketing team into workflows.\nAnd so yeah, thank you for giving us the rundown on this.\nThat was awesome.\nMy pleasure.\n",
