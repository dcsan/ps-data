  "cleanText": "Today, we're going to build a mobile app, 100% with AI.\nThis mobile app is going to be a full clone of an iPhone app that did $7 million worth of revenue last month.\nThis app literally does $80 million worth of revenue per year.\nAnd we are going to build it for iPhone and for iPad in one sitting.\nAnd then we're going to send it to the App Store.\nOn this channel, we don't waste any time.\nLet's just dive in.\nMuhammad, what are we building today?\nAll right.\nSo, we're going to build a phone storage cleaner.\nThese have been blowing up recently.\nI don't know if you've seen it on your TikTok or Instagram.\nThey have ads everywhere or it's essentially like Tinder but for your photos.\nSo, if you swipe left on a photo, it deletes it.\nSwipe right, you keep it.\nThat's been blowing up recently.\nAnd then this app called Cleanup, $7 million last month in revenue just for cleaning up your like iPhone storage.\nThat's insane.\nAnd they have over 50 million active users last month as well.\nSo, it's something that's just been taking off.\nSo, we're going to VibeCode this app.\nLet's write out the first prompt.\nWhat is the first prompt that we're going to tell AI to build this app?\nPlease search the internet.\nTry to find cleanup.\nAnd then we're going to tell it to really understand the purpose of these apps and what they accomplish.\nKind of the main value proposition.\nYeah, we will recreate the entire thing.\nPlease import all of my photos.\nOkay.\nSo, this app because it's native um iOS app, it will have access to all of your photos.\nYeah.\nAnd you can give it permissions to access all of your photos just like a normal mobile app.\nAnd we're going to build this on iPhone and iPad at the same time.\nYeah.\nYou think that's a good enough prompt?\nI think that that looks good to me.\nAll right, let's ship it.\nSo, copy the prompt.\nYou are opening up an app, VibeCode, which is basically it's cloud code but builds mobile apps and it's better for mobile apps.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo, these are basically going to be sync.\nYeah.\nI guess you can start out on your phone.\nYeah.\nAnd paste the prompt.\nYeah.\nWe got to do is paste that generate and then we'll just wait for the agent to finish.\nAnd then I can go over to my iPad and see that started uh the creation process.\nAnd okay, so now they're they're synced.\nSo on the Vibe app, you just entered in a prompt to build an app.\nAnd since you're signed into the same account, you can open them up on iPhone and iPad.\nWe don't need to have any we don't need to have cursor.\nWe don't even need to use our computer.\nWe're using our iPhone and iPad.\nYeah.\nAmazing.\nSo it's also it's building on my iPad right now.\nIf you see that and then it's also building on my phone right here as well.\nOkay.\nSo they're in perfect sync.\nThey're in perfect sync.\nAnd you can see that.\nOkay.\nIt's loading.\nOkay.\nIt's done.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nSo, talk to me what what's going on here.\nAll right.\nStorage cleaner.\nFree up space.\nIt actually looks really nice.\nUm, has this bottom nav bar that they all have.\nAnd right now, I think it's just loading in all the pictures that I have.\nSo, that'll take a minute, but let's see.\nI can scan for duplicates.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nOkay.\nA thousand a thousand photos loaded.\nWait.\nSo, went through a thousand of your photos.\nYeah.\nSo, what does that mean?\nOkay.\nNow let's scan for duplicates.\nOh [ __ ] 251.\n7.9 GB worth of\nYeah.\nOkay.\nAnd now it's just a bunch of duplicate photos that I mean, yeah, they are duplicates.\nI can review and delete them.\nNo way.\nAnd these are they have native access to your phone.\nYeah.\nAnd delete.\nAnd that actually delete from your phone.\nYeah.\nAmazing.\nLet's see what happened.\nYeah, it deleted it.\nIt deleted it.\nAnd so that's a fix we can do.\nYou want to fix that right now?\nWhy not just go through that?\nEasy fix.\nI'll fix that.\nI'm going to find some more bugs.\nI can throw all the fixes in at once.\nAnd we can even write that down as well.\nYeah, I'll I'll I'll note it.\nAll right.\nNow, we can scan for blurry photos.\nAwesome.\nAnd then maybe we want more than just duplicates and photos.\nMaybe we want to see all the photos eventually.\nOh, like a whole photo all gallery.\nYeah, all of them.\nAnd then it seems I definitely have more than a thousand photos.\nSo there seems to be a limit and so let's see if we can also push that higher.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nSo delete animation, right?\nBecause it is being deleted but it's not updating on the visual until you leave.\nYou press back and then you go back in.\nThen you see that it has been deleted.\nIt's just like a it's just the fact that it's not showing up immediately.\nOkay.\nAnd then that you want all of your photos um like to show just show like a grid of all your photos and then you're being cut off at a thousand.\nSo those are the three things.\nOkay.\nSo uh when I delete the pictures they they do delete off of my device but they still show up in the app.\nSo please fix that state error.\nYeah.\nYou had to go back and then come back into that gallery.\nI think you would say that.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat's what happened.\nUm, and also we want more quick actions.\nUm, so think about different type of um, categories you can add for these photos.\nAnd then I also want another category with just all of the photos as well.\nAnd also there seems to be a cut off limit at 1,000 photos.\nLet's make that 30,000.\nPause that and it should transcribe.\nAmazing.\nSo you just recorded those three changes.\nPlease fix that error state.\nAnd we want more quick actions.\nAll photos and the limit.\nSounds good.\nLet's send that.\nAll right.\nSo now the agent, yep, the agents are working together.\nUh both on iPhone and iPad.\nAnd this is like the same code.\nAnd what's cool about this is you can actually say like on iPad I want it to look like this, but iPhone I want it to look like this.\nWe can we can actually make custom layouts for device specifically even though they are sharing a codebase basically right now.\nAll right, looks like it's done upgrading.\nWhoa, we added a bunch of new features.\nOkay, all photos, duplicate, large, old, screenshots, and videos.\nOkay, so it is interesting that there's this kind of like little um loading period at the beginning.\nYeah, I just have to refresh.\nYeah.\nOkay, cool.\nCool.\nUm so I'm sure I can add it.\nSo, what did we try to add?\nThe delete animation.\nYou want to try and delete something off of one of the categories?\nYeah.\nSo, let's go over here and delete this picture.\nDelete.\nWell, I can still see it deleted.\nWait.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah.\nSo, let's try that again.\nDelete.\nOkay.\nUh, what else did we want to do?\nWe wanted to do the all photos.\nSo, now it's showing.\nIs there an all photos section now?\nYes.\nYes, there is an all photos section.\nOkay.\nSo, it added the all photos feature and it also didn't cut us off at 1,000 cuz I saw that you had there's a lot more than a thousand now.\nYeah.\nSo, wait, go back.\nAnd so, earlier you had how many gigabytes?\nHow much how many gigabytes do you have now in there?\nOr is it I have 123.\nAnd I think previously I had 20.\nJust 20.\nAnd then we can check out the iPad.\nIt sort of does the same thing.\nDelete.\nAnd so, we still don't have this like delete animation for whatever reason.\nAll right.\nI got it.\nYou want to cue me up a prompt here?\nYeah.\nListen to me very carefully, Claude.\nWhat I need you to do is I need you to allow me to go into one of the categories and I need you to when I delete one of the photos, right, it shows that like are you sure you want to delete message that's looks native to iPhone.\nAnd when I press delete, it's deleting it.\nAnd I know that because when I press back and come back in, I see that it's been deleted.\nBut as soon as I press delete, it doesn't immediately show that it's being deleted right away.\nI want it to show me and be responsive and show me that that it's being deleted as soon as I press that delete button.\nSo, please add that in.\nThoughts on the prompt?\nThat was a good prompt.\nI think it should.\nYou were stern with it in the very beginning, too.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nListen up, Claude.\nWell, and and so this is um I actually don't recommend doing what we did before, which is we did three edits in one.\nI think it's better to go one at a time.\nIt is fun to see.\nIt's fun for our internal testing when we test when you're building an agent to see if it can do that because users often ask for multiple things at once, but as just a general prompting guide, it's probably faster and better to just go one thing at a time.\nYeah, for sure.\nOr at least make sure that they're related like the all photos and then also like the limiting to a thousand seem to be a related thing.\nThen after this, yeah, we can work like on the 10 and then we can do some design.\nI think it's as tempting as it is now to like be like, \"Oh, I want it to look good.\"\nLike I would recommend getting the core functionality of the app and then doing the design.\nYeah, the design's the easy part.\nYeah, that's the easy part.\nAnd then that way at the end you can just be like, \"By the way, you are absolutely not changing any of the functionality of the app.\nYou're just changing the design.\nPlease make it look like this.\nYeah, it's good that we know it works.\nIt has all of my photos and it actually deletes them.\nYeah.\nAnd so that's pretty cool.\nSo then when we add the Tinder feature, how are they going to show up?\nIs it going to be random?\nIs it going to be um we can have a few different ways.\nWe can do like chronological order.\nWe can have it random.\nWe can have uh separate Tinder swipings for like every category.\nOoh.\nOh, I see.\nSo maybe you have a normal feed which is completely random, right?\nSo it's the main feed.\nIt's completely random.\nYeah.\nAnd then maybe there's like a in this settings mode, you can like just toggle between like if you want to switch to a new category, maybe we have those ordered from highest amount of photos to lowest amount of photos.\nYeah.\nAnd then that way you can do random and then biggest to smallest.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nWell, let's see the new update.\nOkay.\nSo, we got to refresh.\nYep.\nGot all my photos.\nAll right.\nSo the only thing we changed was the just one thing.\nSo ideally this will immediately respond.\nOkay.\nIt just refresh the entire thing and just look like it's gone.\nVery interesting.\nI think that's good enough for now.\nYou know, we're building an MVP.\nObviously, we'd like to see it animate out like just show the image and just kind of like vanish.\nUm we are dealing with a lot of photos here.\nLike yeah, this is a lot.\nThese are 4,000 images and we probably have to change like the pageionation of these.\nLike there's a lot of issues that we could dig into, but like for an MVP it doesn't really matter.\nShould we do the Tinder feature?\nYeah, let's do it.\nSo, how do you want this to look?\nThis is what I'm thinking for the Tinder feature.\nWe I think it should be its own tab.\nYou know, maybe it's the center tab, right?\nAs soon as you get there, photos will start showing up and they should randomly show up in a Tinder feed.\nSwipe left or right to delete.\nYeah.\nThen there should be a little toggle.\nLet's say a toggle on the top right with a folder icon.\nWhen you press that, we'll have it go from I should be recording this.\nOkay.\nSo, this is how the Tinder thing.\nSo, there's a new there is a new tab at the bottom that is called Tinder.\nAnd and uh and this is a Tinder-like experience where you can swipe left to delete, swipe right to keep.\nYeah.\nAnd these are random.\nSo they take random photos.\nBy default, it's random.\nAnd on this feed, it shows the photo.\nYou can either keep or delete.\nOn the top right of this screen, there should be a folder icon, and it should allow you to go through photos in specific folders.\nSo all the photos that are listed here, all the different categories that are listed in the app should also show up in this little menu.\nAnd they should show up in order of how many photos there are in that folder.\nAnd you should be able to click on that and then you're only deleting or keeping images from that folder.\nAnd that should still be in random order.\nYeah.\nAnd we want this to feel like Tinder.\nThis is a hard This is the hardest thing we've done yet.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nLet's go ahead and send it.\nLet's ship it.\nBut right now, the app works pretty well for what it's at.\nAll right.\nSo, it looks like Yep, it's done.\nYeah.\nI'll just go ahead and refresh it.\nOkay.\nMy app crashed.\nOkay.\nAnd I see a fifth tab.\nI do see a fifth tab down there.\nCentered swipe.\nWhat is it called?\nWhat did it I can't read the tab.\nWhat does it say?\nUh, it's actually the one to the right of the middle one is just blurry photos.\nLet's try it.\nOkay.\nOh, what?\nSo, we seem to have gotten issues on this one.\nSo, yeah.\nUm, what happens?\nWhere does the error occur?\nOkay, the error occurs not in the home screen.\nOkay, not when it loads all the photos.\nIt doesn't happen when I load more photos.\nIt happens when I go into swipe.\nAnd what it looks like is there some type of animation error that uh Okay.\nSo, just copy and dismiss.\nCopy and dismiss.\nPaste it back into the AI.\nWhen I go to swipe, this error occurs.\nAll right.\nYeah, let's send that one through.\nAll right.\nSo, we are fixing the animation error.\nAnd we thought this would be the hardest feature to add.\n\n\nSo, this is the first time we got a bug.\nYeah, this is the first time it ever threw an error that we.\nYeah.\nAnd it's been all reliable since I started vibe coding.\nAll right, let's see.\nLet's uh get the photo.\nSwipe.\nOh.\nOh, wow.\nOkay.\nOh, so we're gonna go through.\nOh, that's so sick, actually.\nOkay, hold on.\nHold on.\nSo, swipe delete or actually this might have some.\nOkay, you might want to I forget that we're literally going through your personal photos right now.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nWell, if anything.\nAll right.\nKeep keep keep for sure.\nSh.\nOoh.\nSo, now I can't swipe anymore.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nThis is good.\nSo, let's try clicking the buttons.\nSo, the buttons at the bottom, the green heart and the X.\nSo, did you just press keep?\nYeah, I pressed keep.\nFind one you can delete and see what happens.\nAll right, let's delete this.\nOkay.\nUm, delete.\nAmazing.\nIt deletes.\nIt deleted.\nLet's try this one.\nOh, wrong photo.\nOh, that could be.\nUm, so yeah, it seems like there's some type Oh, wait.\nLet's check out the uh the folders.\nI could see they're up here.\nSee the all photos on the top.\nI see the all photos at the top.\nCan you click on it?\nI am.\nAnd it's doing something weird.\nI see something under myself.\nAll right.\nWe might have a long prompt in store for us right now.\nLet's check the iPad cuz there's more real estate here.\nThere's more real estate in the iPad.\nOkay.\nLet's sit.\nAll right.\nSo, all photos.\nI could see something that also has try and delete it or something.\nI mean, I kind of want to keep it, but let's try delete.\nKeep it.\nOkay.\nUm, yeah, delete.\nThat's my sister.\nDefinitely want to keep that.\nI can't.\nYeah.\nSo, the swipe is still um broken.\nBut cool that it works.\nYeah.\nSo, it's cool that it works.\nI think it looks pretty good.\nThe images could be less tall because they're covering up the buttons.\nOr we can lower the buttons.\nBut I think let's just make the images just max height smaller, right?\nYeah.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nLet's let's open up a prompt here.\nLet's just talk it through.\nSo, everything is good except for the swipe.\nThere's a few errors.\nFirst of all, after the first swipe, when I actually move the picture to the right or the left, I can't swipe after that.\nIt seems to get stuck and the image looks a little blurred and grayed out.\nSo, please fix that.\nAlso, please make the images themselves smaller because they're going over some of the things on the screen like the X and the heart and the folders on the top.\nYeah, I think that's good.\nI think you got everything.\nOne little thing to note is that yeah, the further you get into your app and it's usually useful to specify like what it's not going to do like you're just changing this thing.\nYou are only changing this thing.\nYou might be inclined to change this, but please don't.\nSo like it's good to set up clear boundaries, especially the later you get in the project, especially it's context is loaded up with um like in the chat it's loaded up with other features you've added.\nSo it's just useful to like really narrow its focus I have found.\nUm so it doesn't do anything unexpected that you find like 10 prompts later.\nYeah.\nUm but I think our prompt was pretty good here.\nAll right, so let's give it the old refresh.\nLet's see if this works.\nSo, all of these changes are within the swipe tab, correct?\nYes.\nThis is all for the swipe.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nLet's go to swipe.\nGo to swipe.\nIt looks like they're no longer covering the buttons.\nLooks really good.\nAll right.\nKeep Ooh, now it works.\nAll right.\nSo, this is fire.\nKeeping that.\nWe're going to delete whatever that is.\nOkay.\nSo, that that's one thing that we should look into is you notice how that is like a horizontal image.\nYeah.\nNotice that was a horizontal image.\nAnd it will the full image isn't showed.\nSo, it should show you the full image, right?\nOkay.\nSo, that's the one thing.\nLet's keep going because I think we could probably do more than this.\nLet's uh let's keep that.\nLet's don't need that anymore.\nOh, okay.\nAnother thing I see.\nLook, when I delete a picture.\nUhhuh.\nI saw my uh Wait, was that even the right image that you just swiped delete on?\nYeah, this is the right image.\nBut let's keep that.\nLike if I Okay, I delete this one.\nYou see this image in the background?\nYeah.\nIt changes and it doesn't seem like it has a good stack.\nAnd that is the right image showing up as the delete, right?\nYeah, that's the right image.\nOkay.\nUm that's my knee.\nOh, this is this is this is strange.\nYou We're literally going through your images.\nThere's Joe.\nHe's almost Look, he's he's about to disappear.\nOh, sorry.\nSo, he's disappearing.\nOkay.\nShow full image aspect ratio is the one thing we want to change.\nYeah.\nUm, and then what's the next thing we want to change?\nUm, it is the the stack is messed up.\nOkay, I think these two are good.\nYeah, that's nice.\nThe animations all look good now.\nUm, just one problem.\nSorry, two problems.\nSome of the images are getting cut out and it depends on their aspect ratio.\nSo, make sure for every photo you show it in the aspect, the original aspect ratio, but keep the uh maximum height the same.\nRight.\nYeah.\nDon't cover up any other elements on the screen.\nYeah.\nAnd so I guess this will mean practically that um like right now the images that are horizontal orientation are the sides are being cut off.\nSo those will just naturally show up as smaller like it won't reach the full max height.\nBut make sure to not change the max height.\nSo they can extend above or below where the current max height is.\nYes.\nAnd you may need to play around with the scale of some of this, the scale for the photos itself.\nAnd the second thing is whenever I swipe left to delete an image, the image that would come right after that disappears and it gets swapped out with another random image.\nSo please fix that so there is concurrency in there and that the stack works correctly and efficiently.\nYep, that sounds good.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nUm yeah, we'll enter that and then I Yeah, let's talk about what could be wrong in the logic of the app right now.\nThis is very interesting.\nUm yeah, ship it.\nOkay, so we shipped that and the app is now loading both the iPhone and the iPad.\nWhile it's loading, I want to talk about what how the app is actually working right now.\nRight.\nSo, the way that it mimics the Tinder feature is it it's showing a random image, which is good, and then as you delete it, it's probably it's just showing another random image behind it.\nSo, what would probably need to change is that it loads like 10 images so that at a time and then like you swipe through them and then I guess the question becomes like when does it load more?\nJust always it'll always be 10 right behind it.\nThat's sort of how like Tik Tok and Instagram work.\nWhen you're scrolling, they'll they'll download and have like five different videos below it ready in case you start.\nYeah, I noticed that even on Twitter, I noticed that when uh I get on a flight and I've been using Twitter and Instagram and Tik Tok and then I lose my internet connection, I can still scroll for a while because they load them.\nAnd so like it's like once you reach the bottom, then it loads like a whole new feed or I don't know how that works.\nIs that difficult logic to change?\nIt shouldn't be that hard.\nNo.\nUm no, that's actually I think an easy fix for it.\nI think another a harder one would be like the image showing the full image because it doesn't really know like it can't like visually see how the images would look and there's like different aspect ratios for every picture.\nIt looks like it finished so we can see what it did exactly.\nWow.\nOkay.\nSo, that was only a couple that was like a minute and a half.\nOkay.\nSo, let's hit the swipe feature.\nAwesome.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nThere's our office.\nHey, what happened?\nThe stack is still a little broken.\nOh, yeah.\nYou see how it changes?\nOkay, that's like the beach, the beautiful beach.\nThen it changed to something else.\nSo, you delete it or do you want it?\nWhat was the other one?\nThe other one was the ratio.\nOh, the aspect ratio looks pretty good.\nLet's see if we can get a Oh, yeah.\nI mean, that's the full image.\nI mean, are they getting cut off?\nDo you have like a horizontal one?\nI'm trying to see if I can I honestly think it's fine.\nWe just need to uh address the stack.\nUm.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nWe can hit this one more directly.\nYeah.\nI'll let you describe it under the frame that I said last time.\nLike you can kind of have it Yeah, I think you'd be better at articulating it.\nI'm going to do it from my phone.\nCool.\nOkay.\nThe image aspect ratio looks good, but we have to still fix the stack issue for when I delete an image.\nUm, it's still it is still the case when I swipe left and I get prompted to actually delete the image by my device, the photo that was right behind that image get swapped out with another before I can even interact with it.\nSo, there seems to be a um stack ordering issue here.\nSo, please look into that and fix that.\nUm, and maybe load more than just three cards at a time.\nYeah, that seems good to me.\nLook into how the likes work because when I swipe right to keep a picture, everything is fine.\nBut when I swipe left and the device prompts me to delete the picture, that's when um the photo swap happens.\nSo it's good on a like.\nYeah.\nOn the like when it deletes.\nLook.\nYeah.\nSo that's the Eiffel Tower or whatever hills.\nThat's the Eiffel Tower.\nThat's okay.\nYou see the fish?\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSee, that's how we just want it to show up.\nThere's just probably like an error in like the math like uh because you're removing an image so it kind of messes up the position or something.\nAll right, let's see the changes.\nGo to swipe and we're looking for um the stack to be good.\nOh, that looks good.\nDon't look at that.\nIt's a negative 900 day on stocks.\nWe want to get rid of that.\nIt looks like it works.\nOh, wait.\nYou switch to a new one?\nYeah, right at the end.\nOh, shoot.\nUm, all right, Connor, you're gone.\nOkay, so I did specify that when it when the device prompts me to delete a picture, that's when it switched to another picture, right?\nAnd right now, that's not the case anymore.\nSo, it fixed that.\nBut when I delete the picture, then it switches.\nSo weird.\nI know.\nSo, I think I think we need one more final shot at this problem.\nWhat if we tried a different approach where we swipe left to delete the pictures, but instead of being prompted to delete all of or delete that picture immediately, what if we like keep it in like this separate like trash bin and then you deleted all of them at once?\nYeah, I think that's good.\nYeah, I think that's way better.\nI hate the delete popup.\nYeah, and it would be annoying to But it needs to it needs to do that to access the photos.\nOkay, so it keeps them in a little trash bin.\nThen you can just like empty trash.\nEmpty trash.\nYeah, just like Apple.\nYeah, let's do it.\nLet's ship it.\nAll right.\nSo, there is still a problem with um the stack shuffle whenever we delete the image when the device prompts me to delete it.\nSo, let's go in this new direction.\nInstead of deleting the image immediately right after I swipe left, we should now have a trash bin that would store the location and the exact photos in that trash bin.\nAnd the user can store many photos in that trash bin and then empty the trash bin, which would delete all of the photos in the trash bin.\nMhm.\nGreat.\nYeah, that should be good.\nAll right, let's see.\nI'm going to keep that one.\nWe can delete that one.\nDelete.\nAnd it doesn't go to my trash bin.\nOh my god.\nOh, it does.\nDoes go to my trash bin.\nIt's just the number does not update.\nSo, that's a little annoying.\nNow, let's see.\nDon't need that.\nOkay.\nLet's delete that as well.\nLet's keep that.\nAll right.\nAll right.\nLet's see.\nDelete all.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, delete four photos.\nSo, it actually does work.\nThe trash bin does work.\nThe only thing is the number by the trash bin.\nI actually like the design of the the trash bin.\nYeah, it's super nice, bro.\nGoing through your photos this way.\nIt's illuminating your your character.\nIt's kind of scary.\nThat should be one more quick fix.\nAwesome.\nThe bin feature works well.\nBesides this one problem, um as I'm swiping left and adding photos to the bin, the number um by the icon does not change.\nSo, I don't ever know how many items are in my bin.\nBut once I go ahead and delete um it does delete all of the photos I swipe left on.\nJust the number on next to the icon, the trash icon stays at zero.\nSo that usually means there was like an issue, like a real issue in the code that it probably found immediately.\nIt didn't have to do much invest in investigating.\nOkay, so let's see the results now.\nAll right, swipe.\nOkay.\nOh, nice.\nLet's keep that one.\nUh, let's keep that one.\nKeep.\nDelete.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nSo, it works.\nThree.\nThat's it.\nThis is now It works perfectly.\nAmazing.\nAmazing.\nYeah.\nDelete all three.\nBoom.\nKeep.\nGreat.\nOh, that hair is crazy, bro.\nOh, you haven't even seen how long it could get.\nAll right.\nCool.\nSo, now we know that that works.\nSo, we can now officially go to the folders.\nAmazing.\nOkay.\nWhat happens if you press folders right now?\nUh, there's only one folder and it's all of them.\nOh, there's only one\n\n\nfolder. I see.\nHold on. Let me test something real quick. So, if I scan for duplicates and then do it, then it might scanning. We should maybe have like an animation. Okay, that's a thousand. Now, let's scan for blurry. Oh, yep. Duplicates. And there is a blurry one. But if you see that, I say it's covered.\nOkay. So I can go to\nSo I think we should change this to be a like a menu that's like over everything that that could work. Maybe there's also\nOkay, let's try that. Um then do we also want it to scan automatically?\nYes.\nYeah, we do want that. Okay.\nOh, when you open the app.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUm everything with the stack works perfectly now. So now let's shift our focus to the Folders uh when swiping. Currently I have to scan for blurry and duplicate photos manually and that's sort of tedious because I have to do that every time I open the app. So let's do that automatically.\nAnd that will achieve um them always being in the folder section in the swipe.\nUm, and then the other thing is that the Folders gets covered up by the images in the swipe screen. So, we got to change the UI for that. Let's try like a dropdown modal that comes down that's on top and in front of everything.\nAnd yeah, I dig it.\nOkay, cool. Let's do that. We want to tell it Yeah, it did a good job. And now we want to shift its focus in another direction so it doesn't touch everything that's already working and now just focuses on what we need it to do.\nMakes sense to me.\nLet's see the new update. Cool. Scan for duplicates. Okay. So now, so we're trying to get it to scan for duplicates immediately and we're getting an error. So let's copy it. Paste it back in. Be like, yo, when I open the app, this error occurs.\nOkay, I'm going to get rid of all of this fluff here. And that's basically stuff the AI couldn't even change if it wanted to. So, there's no point in putting it there.\nAll right, let's see the changes here. Ideally, it'll auto scan. Is it auto scanning?\nAuto scan enabled. I think I think it actually scanned it, but now I just have to refresh to get the state to work.\nOkay, that's fine.\nUm, we can also fix that as well, but that's fine. So, that works. That works for now. Um, yeah, maybe we'll put a refresh button at the top for the MVP. But like for now, let's go to the let's go to the swipe tab and let's click on the all photos.\nOh, nice.\nAmazing. So, now we have duplicates. So, you can click on duplicates.\nYep.\nI think that's great.\nBlurry. Yep.\nAmazing.\nAnd find one to swipe left. I know these are valuable to you. Yeah. Okay.\nAnd it works.\nIt adds to the thing. and clear your trash.\nCool. And let's empty the trash. Delete the photos.\nAmazing. Awesome. All right, there's our MV actually. So, now let's do some design stuff.\nYeah.\nDo you have ChatGPT on your computer?\nYep.\nLet's open up ChatGPT and let's generate the app icon because remember this is going to be called Photo Monkey.\nWhile uh three prompts ago when it was loading, I bought photo monkey.app on namecheep. Yeah. And I already made a landing page. It's pretty bad. Um, you can open up the landing page if you want right now. Um, not not on Photo Monkey. It's in your texts.\nUm, this is what it'll look like.\nUh, Photo Monkey. It's fine. And then in you see terms at the top right and privacy.\nPrivacy.\nThose are what you need for the Apple App Store.\nThat's all you need.\nYep. That's all you need. Terms, privacy, and then we'll we'll get it on photomon.app. Let's go to ChatGPT and uh create an app icon of a photo monkey of a monkey holding a photo IO. Yeah. iOS icon. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see what it does.\nSay, please make this a cartoon image uh in the style of a top 10 app on the App Store icon and have it include the monkey holding a photo.\nThat's a cute monkey though. So now it should be cartoon style.\nI like where this is going. This is going to be good. Oh, it has a little little icon on it. Like a little notification icon. I dig it.\nTop 10. I guess I'm sure that's where it got that.\nOkay. Okay. Oh, it gave it a little award. Okay. Say, please make it full screen and don't have the white background. And get rid of the 10. And then make the image a photo. Should we do a photo of a trash bin?\nA trash bin. Or maybe like um what do monkeys not like?\nOh, so we'll make him like angry and he's getting rid of it. Maybe he's putting it in the trash and it's a photo. What do monkeys not like?\nI know. I'm trying to think.\nUm uh a gorilla.\nOkay. A gorilla. Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah.\nMake the image that the monkey is holding of a gorilla.\nOf a gorilla.\nAnd make him putting it in like in the monkey. Make it put it in a trash bin.\nMonkey. Okay. Let's see what that does.\nOkay. So, um, it looks like it's going to be like, uh, 9 by6.\nYeah.\nSo, I would just type in right now, make it square.\nUm, and then as long as we like it, it's fine. Like, it's not that crazy. Oh my god, that's perfect. So, please make it square.\nWhy is his nose the same color as the gorilla? Actually, keep it. It's fine. It's fine. I like the blue in the background.\nThis is good.\nThis is awesome.\nSend me that image, actually. Just send me that real quick. I will uh toss it in the landing page.\nAwesome. Okay, it made it a square. Um, let's download that. So, there's our app icon. And so, now maybe it should be like a splash screen. So, like make it like put that image in the center while it's loading or like it's loading. It's just like Photo Monkey is getting your images or something like that. And then change the name of the app to Photo Monkey. And maybe like I'll actually get the um like I'll do photo color and we'll get the actual um or we we'll do a color picker. Make a little splash screen. Put the image in the center. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\nYou want to add here. Type this in.\n#2596B.\nAnd then Yeah, let's just do that for now. Let's just go one at a time.\nYep.\nIf we wanted to make it refresh automatically, too, we could do that later. But this app is actually fire. It's great. I I mean, look at this. This app $34 is How much is that? That's 300 almost $400 a year for this little app.\nNo wonder they're making so much money.\nAnd we just created it in like 10 prompts.\nYeah. Awesome.\nLike I actually think if we sat down for like three straight days, we could make the app better than the actual app.\nWe could launch it for way less for free.\nYeah.\nJust maybe if we hated the guy.\nYeah. It doesn't appear.\nUm, there we go. That's money. Wait, refresh it again on the iPad.\nThe iPad refreshes really quick because there's less photos.\nI see. So, make make the minimum amount of reef time for on a refresh 3 seconds.\nYeah. Oh, I love it.\nI love it. That's good. We're good.\nPhoto Monkey.\nMaybe we should make it also refresh automatically.\nOkay, let's do that. So, automatic refresh and minimum of 3 seconds. That That's a good sweet. Okay, that looks really great. Can you please make it so that whenever the user first opens the app, it auto refreshes the page, which would show the monkey cuz right now the user has to manually refresh by scrolling up. And then can you also make it so that the minimum amount of time the monkey is shown is 3 seconds? All right. So, for an auto refresh.\nOkay. Auto refresh works. And if you look at the iPad, that would have been 3 seconds. Boom. There it is.\nGood.\nPhoto Monkey is done.\nThat is pretty much Yeah.\nAll right. So, we got all the features. I guess we can um Oh, so it's refreshing here to get the pages, right? Because Yeah.\nThere we go. And now if you click\nThat's my boy Troy.\nThat's great. Wait, click on the Folders at the top.\nYou can now switch it.\nOh, yeah. Yeah, cuz it's refreshing to get those Folders.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThat's cool.\nCool.\nAnd yeah, these are all good. Yeah.\nAmazing. The app's done.\nMVP's done.\nYes, it is done. Now, we can push it to the App Store for everyone.\nYeah. So, we want to get on the App Store. Now, what?\nOkay. So, there's two ways we can do it. We can SSH into it via cursor or we can just download the code. I think I want to SSH\nLet's do it into it. That's easy.\nYeah. And so if you guys saw a video we did I did with an about three weeks ago, we showed you exactly how to SSH from the Vibe Code app into Cursor. It's super easy. Um you just open up the menu like you're editing it except you're going to press these three little dots here and then you hit connect via SSH.\nThis is going to uh then you're just going to hit send email instructions and that will send you an email.\nYeah.\nAnd then I can open the email as well.\nYeah.\nSo, he's going to get an email. There we go. It shows up now. You just click on the link from cursor. Opening cursor. You see where it says cursor? Click on that. This will automatically open up cursor. And then all you have to do now is this should prompt. So, hit enter.\nNow, paste in your password. So, if you go back to the app, you see on the app here, it has a password. You don't even need to do the SSH. The email included that part in there. So you just paste that into the top in the app. Press enter.\nGuess what? Now after it loads here, any change you make on cursor will be updated on your phone. So like we did here, we had our our phone and our iPad um going in tandem. We can do that from wherever. And then if we want to access the terminal, if you're a nerd and you like to code, you can easily get it into cursor. And we have it right now.\nYeah.\nAnd so we don't need to make any changes on cursor. Um, and again, you could have done this. We could do this same process with Windsurf, I'm pretty sure.\nYeah, maybe. I don't.\nYeah. Anything that's a VS Code. You can do a VS code.\nVS Code as well. Yeah. And so now we just need to get it on the App Store.\nYeah.\nUm, so what we need to do now is I would go to that image that I um that you generated.\nI'm just going to give it a cursor.\nNo, drag it into your project files.\nOkay. Yeah, I think I think you need to do that somewhere.\nRight here. I'm just going to rename it to icon.png. And that should be what we need.\nYeah. And then I would just tell cursor to just like put it in the right folder.\nAnd we're going to use this as the app icon.\nYeah. Let's just commit this change so it reflects everywhere and so we don't run into any scary ghosts when we reconnect to SSH. Okay, cool. Please. um icon PNG. Oh, it hasn't indexed the codebase. So, like all my files aren't here. Like if I there's no like\nOkay.\nRead me can\nSo, yeah. Yeah. Please move icon into the correct place.\nYeah. Into the correct place.\nUse it for the app icon and splash screen.\nYeah.\nIs that it?\nYeah. There's one other small thing.\nOkay.\nCool. So, it made a new folder assets and it just moved icon.png into assets.\nOkay. So, now the monkey photo is in assets. Now I can use it.\nYeah. Yeah.\nNow we can continue.\nYeah. And then it did some app.json.\nCool. Now there's like one more thing that you need to do um which I can show you. Cool.\nAnd it's super simple. If you just submitted the the code how it is right now, you'll get these error messages.\nU missing purpose string and info.p list. It's sort of like a um a safety feature for Apple where you have to um like describe why your app needs certain things like for here like calendar usage or contacts, camera. Um you kind of need that in your apps like core. So Apple can trust you to use those type of cursor to like analyze the codebase and figure out what it would need for this.\nYeah. Um and please fix this for everything in my app.\nAnd it should go ahead and add that stuff.\nSo it'll analyze the app. It'll basically be like why it needs access to all of your photos, which is a probably a big permissions thing like to access all your photos. That's I feel like that they're probably more strict about apps that can do that.\nYeah.\nUm and so yeah, you always want to double check that it's there before you submit it or else um you just will run into that error. But then after that, I think we should be good to just go ahead and submit it. So just like two changes, one icon change, permissions icon and then P list.\nYeah.\nOkay. Okay. So, photo icon, P list, and then three. Step three is going to be to NPX test flight.\nYeah.\nAnd then obviously if you haven't set up your test flight already, I'll link down below this video somewhere on like how to get that set up. That's just an annoying thing that you have to go through to get set up.\nAnd then you can move on to the next step. But yeah, can you hit refresh it?\nI like this flash screen. It's pretty good.\nThat is nice. That is a cool logo.\nI dig it.\nOkay. Wow. It added a lot of a lot of um P list stuff.\nUm some of which we may not need, but I think\n\n\nIt's just good to have.\nThat is a lot, but that's okay.\nNow, let's go ahead and push this to get so we don't lose anything.\nSo we're basically committing our changes.\nYeah.\nAnd so now that'll reflect both in\nWell, we didn't make any big changes really.\nYeah, we did.\nBut it'll just keep progress and everything should still work.\nCool.\nAmazing.\nNow, let's open the terminal.\nSo, okay.\nSo, now we're moving to step three.\nWe first did the photo icon, then we did this little pist feature so we don't run into that error um when we submit it.\nNow, we're doing npx test flight.\nAnd that's basically what we type in here.\nYeah.\nI mean, and even if you didn't want to do this, you could get cursor_ai to do it for you.\nYeah.\nYou just say, \"I'm ready to get it on the App Store.\"\nNow, what?\nYeah.\nBut we could do npx test flight, and it should make me log into um\nYeah.\nAnd then if you weren't logged in right here, it would probably be like you need to log in to test flight.\nAnd then you would basically just follow those instructions and then go to the internet or go to ChatGPT and say, how do I get set up on test flight?\nHow do I get set up with on the App Store?\nIt will take you through the process.\nIt does, if you've never done this before, it does take some time to get approved.\nAnd this may take some time.\nThat is the downside of the Apple App Store versus deploying it on the internet.\nSo, you also need um an Expo account.\nYep.\nWhich is free.\nYou can go ahead and here it's making me log in to EAS.\nExpo, would you automatically create an EAS project?\nYes, you want that if it's a new one.\nUm, and it just created the What is it?\nMonkey.\nPhoto monkey.\nAnd so yeah, it's gonna build in the cloud and then submit it to App Store Connect.\nAmazing.\nUm, and it's loading right now.\nIt's loading.\nI um would you like Yes.\nI want that to be my identifier, which is basically just my app.\nAmazing.\nUm, iOS app only uses standard exempt encryption.\nIt the most of the time it will be yes.\nI think you'll know if you have some weird encryption like Telegram or something, but Photo Monkeys has no encryption because it's all local.\nCool.\nWould you like to log into your Apple account?\nAnd this would be your App Store Connect account as well.\nOkay.\nIt's the same thing.\nOkay.\nUm I'll do it on my phone.\nOh, very interesting that it's like completely hidden.\nYeah, that's cool.\nUm select a team.\nI'll do just myself.\nUm, and I'll be my own I'll be my provider.\nSounds good.\nUm, yeah.\nYeah.\nUh, what is this asking?\nReuse the distribution certificate?\nYes.\nWould you like to generate a new Apple provision?\nYes.\nUh, it doesn't matter.\nYes, sure.\nSo, yeah, we're basically just logging into things and saying yes to things.\nYes, that's a lot of yesing and that's about it.\nAnd then this will submit a build.\nIs it sending it now or is it um computing project fingerprint?\nUm, I think it's just I think it's going to send it to EAS now to actually start building it.\nAmazing.\nWhich should be right now.\nOh, no.\nIt should have Yeah, it's I think it's going to create um the app in the App Store Connect right now.\nOkay, cool.\nSafari.\nAnd you go to that website I sent you earlier, the photo monkey.\nI refresh that.\nThere we go.\nNice.\nUm, swipe away your photo clutter.\nYeah,\namazing.\nUm, coming soon.\nAnd then once we get on the App Store, we'll put the link instead of it saying coming soon.\nComing soon, we'll put it right here.\nYeah, it'll just say get the app.\nSo, literally while you were working, I got photo monkey.app.\nUm, and then I deployed it to Verscell or I I went to Vzero and created this.\nAnd so, here we can actually click I deployed it.\nWe now have a build submitted to the App Store and we have sent our app to the App Store which has the following uh features.\nYeah.\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and log into the App Store Connect so you can see how the build is doing over there.\nOkay.\nPhoto monkey right here.\nPhoto monkey.\nAll right.\nAll right.\nIt's on there.\nAnd we just basically await their response.\nAnd so you're just going to check your email.\nIf something goes wrong, you now have this on cursor_ai that you could basically just paste in the errors back in cursor_ai.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nCool.\nYeah.\nAnd by the way, when you make changes on cursor_ai through the SSH feature, you can test it live on your phone.\nJust hit the refresh button and you can test it live.\nAnd yeah, we vibe coded a full app.\nIt's submitted into the App Store.\nIt's and we have basically every feature that it had and it's doing how much per uh per year?\n$80 million a year.\n$84 million every year.\nAnd we just upload it to the App Store.\nAnd if it got accepted, it would be free.\nYeah, it'll be free.\nThat's what we did today.\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n",
