  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHello and welcome back to The Big Brain Podcast.\nI'm your co-host, Larry Serak, CEO of The Block, and I'm joined by Namik, chief strategy officer of Megie.\nToday we have Guy Young, founder of Ethena, and Rune Christensen, founder of Sky, formerly known as Maker.\nLet's do a quick round of intros.\nI'm Rune.\nI'm the co-founder of Sky, formerly known as Maker, which is a decentralized DeFi protocol backing USDS and the DeFi stable coins, which together are the third largest stable coin ecosystem in the world and the largest decentralized stable coin.\nYeah, I'm Guy, the founder of Ethena.\nWe issue something that we call a synthetic dollar.\nSo it looks a bit different to a stable coin in terms of the construction and the backing behind it.\nWe came out to the market around 14 months ago and grew from zero to around 6 and a half billion at the peak in December of last year.\nAnd yeah, been working alongside the Sky team in Rune since day one and I think you know similar products doing similar things within DeFi and happy to be here.\nWell, you guys have been clearly at the forefront of not just DeFi but also stable coins over the last few years.\nThe my first question and we can start with Rune is you know DeFi obviously exploded at this point like 5 years ago for the first time then it kind of fell off a little bit in terms of mind share but seems like some interest is coming back now but especially the infrastructure seem to have changed drastically to the for the better.\nSo Rune, how what's your perspective on how different it is right now than it was when it first kind of came to the spotlight?\nI mean, it has really really matured.\nThat's really the thing that's so different.\nIt's sort of bittersweet for a former ideologue like me, right, that got into crypto as a Bitcoin maxi and, you know, came to rugpull the the evil empire of global finance and all that.\nAnd what's basically happened with DeFi now, it has it has really just become like a increasingly financialized industry, right?\nWhere it's all about, you know, what's the real value?\nWhat are the real data points that show how you're creating value?\nObviously, DeFi continues to be all about the big picture, the massive vision of of uh you know, huge improvements to global finance, but now it's really rooted in well, if you're going to change the world tomorrow, then like how are you running a sustainable business today?\nThat's very different, right?\nBecause it used to be all about uh huge hyperbolic claims and crazy ideology and sort of visionaries that would then raise gigantic sums of money.\nUh and then without fail kind of crashed the whole crypto economy one way or another, right?\nTo the point where the market became immune to this kind of stuff and that then allowed us to enter this new era where things are just so much more uh grounded in reality.\nThe really big difference like the way you can sort of really make an example out of what's so different is the prevalence of I mean what we um I think um accidentally ended up calling real world assets, right?\nWhich is sort of a an annoying misnomer in a sense because obviously crypto assets are also real.\nBut when we say real world assets is re it actually really means assets that rely on like the old world or the traditional system to basically uh have have a real value, right?\nTo have a kind of a value that's like like rooted in in um yeah like the the the traditional structures of legal enforcement and financial systems and so on.\nFor me like the thing that finally kind of fully or at least like was a huge push over the edge in terms of accepting okay this is now this is the this is the age we're in you have to start thinking differently right is actually the emergence of Ethena right because uh I completely I mean Guy he would like ping me when they were still like um like pre-launch and I mean I I I I definitely missed some pretty sweet deals on uh on getting some good like good Ethena token allocations but at the timer is just I looked at it and I was like well to me this looks centralized so I mean I don't this is not going to be big because why how are you going to how you going to get the visionaries and how how are you not going to just get like cancelled for not being uh ideologically pure enough right um then after it launched sadly only after it was actually live I realized that okay well this is uh based on like exposure to really good economics on centralized exchanges but it actually has a really like a really strong uh setup for for like its resilience which is that you have this like you hold things in like custodians and there's like this segregation like there's all these like approaches to how you make it secure uh despite being sort of like despite of following a more like idealistic uh design.\nSo I think Ethena might be one of the first examples of like a like a DeFi business that um you know that just like succeeded off like a a really clever construction basically that is all about making a lot of money creating a lot of value uh opening up access to pertocs like Sky which then let Skyo dump you know allocate hundreds of millions into it quite early uh rather than being like you know a big um visionary thing that got a bunch of people excited without really knowing exactly how uh the real value was going to be created.\nDo you think we've like overcorrected towards being very pragmatic as opposed to trying to solve some of these like big big problems with the financial system?\nWell, I mean that's what you us for in Sky.\nSo, we're taking care of that in Sky.\nWe're taking our sweet time as always, but um basically there's obviously a lot of like there's a kind of a next phase beyond okay, we figured out how you know what not to do in crypto, which is because it's dumb and like just a bunch of like going around in circles around uh semantics and ideology and and and vision, but instead we're like, okay, there are certain business models that work.\nUh those are the ones we should focus on, and now let's try to compete in those and try to get them really efficient, right?\nSo we can deliver some value today.\nThat's then going to give us the sustainability we need to take our time to, you know, actually take the technology to its true potential, which is super duper amazing.\nLike it still is going to change the world and be everywhere and integrate all over the place and and really have a real impact.\nUh maybe not as like uh again as sort of in a such in as a kind of visionary purist way as as I used to think 15 years ago, but it's all it's all coming and and I don't I think it's a you know we always say things like whenever there's like a crypto crash it's actually good for the industry because it's like it's good to kind of go through that and sort of um not get overly excited and and and do too many uh dumb things, right?\nAnd in the same way in the sense that now things have become quite cynical and mercenary that that is also good in the sense that that now that makes a huge opening for the visionaries and sort of like it it it lets you know it lets people come in in a from a position where you got to really be sustainable but then if you have some truly interesting ideas you know there's going to be a kind of a a scarcity of that right so there's a big opportunity.\n[Music]\nI feel like the craziness of macro translated positively for Bitcoin, right?\nLike now more than ever, people understand the value proposition of Bitcoin.\nSimultaneously, we've seen like a much clearer and fleshed out, you know, let's say RWA approach to DeFi.\nUm and the entire value proposition of like you know a permissionless financial system and like all the value propositions associated with that is kind of flown to Bitcoin.\nI do believe that there will be a correction to like this narrative shift very much towards like hey let's use DeFi as a tool for effectively a lot of these off-chain financial instruments to be more efficient but that's obviously what Guy might have a lot of domain expertise in.\nYeah and and on that side Guy if you can maybe quickly touch on um you know your vision when when it finally when it clicked for you that building something like Ethena will make sense and also your perspective on why do you think it took so long to build a protocol like this like it's it it seems like everything has been tried in DeFi and um you guys came out relatively late and still succeeded to to the effect that you have um so what do you think contributed to that?\nYeah I think um it's it's mainly like a difference in perspectable approach that I actually had when I first came across DeFi so uh my introduction to DeFi was actually using MakerDAO uh in 2019 and that was kind of the moment where I was like this is incredible that I can deposit ETH and then uh you know draw up like a loan without anyone telling me what to do.\nUm but the thing that I actually found the most interesting wasn't like uh that was like an incredible experience sort of going through that and it sort of felt like the first time where like finance sort of felt magical like using technology if that if that makes sense.\nBut I think the piece that interested me the most back then wasn't actually um the the idea that these things were fully decentralized and that was like an important quality.\nIt was actually that uh I'd spent a lot of time looking at fintech as like an investment category in my old job.\nAnd I'd always felt that fintech was a bit of a bit of a letdown actually in terms of you know different front ends with uh with fancy looking UIs but kind of like the same backend infrastructure that's had in the background.\nAnd actually if you looked at the P&Ls and uh business structures for for uh fintech, it didn't actually look that interesting in terms of like the cost savings that you were making from those businesses.\nWhat I think really interested me was basically if you had this idea where software could basically scale or finance could scale at the marginal cost of software and you didn't need 2,000 people to run something like a Sky or an Ethena.\nThat's actually really interesting because you can scale to 10 or 20 or 30 billion dollars and maybe you have 20 30 40 people who are sort of running it rather than a few thousand and that to me was actually the interesting idea which is when capital can move around the world at like the speed of the speed of information that's actually a really powerful thing to sort of create like powerful businesses.\nSo, um, that's kind of what drew me to the space originally.\nAnd I didn't have a lot of these, I don't know, decentralized ideals, which I think maybe held back some builders in the past where they thought that they needed to do that to sort of appease a different crowd during a different period of time.\nAnd then I think yeah the point that you're making is um a fair one which was really the only difference between Ethena and uh two projects who try to do the same thing actually last cycle was that difference in approach from my side which was saying clearly you are making a trade-off here and you're going to have to get people comfortable with what that trade-off is but actually if you're just honest to people and saying you guys are all adults here are the risks if you're going to be engaging with this and these are specifically the trade-offs that we're making them making and why we're actually making them.\nI just thought that that was something that you could get people comfortable with if you're sort of being transparent and and open about it.\nAnd then that obviously just unlocks in order of magnitude you know uh in terms of scale that you can actually reach uh when you make those trade-offs.\nSo it's obviously been a trend I think that actually the whole space has actually gone towards a cycle.\nSo if you see some of the most successful products actually uh you know Hyperlid was basically a centralized exchange when they were running like four uh validators before they started to open it up.\nUh pump fund is kind of like you know um a casino that's sort of like just settling on Solana and then even Namik at Megath I guess his approach here is actually saying we're going to maximally centralize like block production in this environment to actually push out um uh you know the u levels of uh throughput that you can actually achieve and I think that these are actually the approaches which are you users are actually responding to in the best way this entire cycle which is we want good products we want products that can sort of scale and a web two sort of equivalent.\nAnd if you can actually just find what quality of decentralization you're actually trying to solve for, it actually makes this all a lot easier.\nSo I think one very good example here is actually with the whole exchange idea.\nI think the optimal actually construction between these two things is you get something that feels like trading on a centralized exchange and it's okay if pieces of it are centralized, but the only thing that you actually care about is that you're customing your own funds onchain.\nAnd so if you told me that I was trading, you know, on an AWS server that was sitting in the background doing all the matching offchain, but I was just holding my assets, that's the only thing I actually care about in terms of like the decentralization of an exchange.\nAnd so I would just sort of encourage people to think think a bit more deeply around this term of decentralization and actually just ask deeper questions of what specific quality you're actually trying to sort of like achieve uh from from doing that.\n[Music]\nAnd you guys both touched on Hyperlid, obviously a huge topic over this entire cycle, but over the last six months, it's become kind of the go-to for everyone.\nWhat do you think uh made it so successful compared to others that tried before, like Dydx obviously fell off a bit, but there were a bunch of projects that tried to do the same thing.\nIs it Guy you're talking about here where it was just a little bit more centralized and usable initially um and just more user friendly or was there something else and and follow up on that are the network effects so strong now that that it's going to be hard to dethrone u that protocol?\nYeah, I think there were a couple of pieces that were different.\nOne was that it was just outright a better product than anything that had existed before.\nI think even Dydx, you know, they had that awkward transition back into a chain where I think I do somewhat feel bad for them because I think a lot of it was actually driven by reg issues within the US where they needed to appear more decentralized and that sort of made a worse product as a result.\nAnd so that was a you know pretty awkward transition that they had to go through.\nSo I think the first piece is just it was the best product by far that we've seen ever in terms of like a onchain um exchange.\nUh I think the other piece is that what people don't understand I think about exchanges is that the only thing that is valuable is actually finding retail taker flow.\nIt has nothing to do about is winter mute or jump plugged in to\n\n\nProvide liquidity because if you have retail taker flow, those guys will turn up, and they'll actually pay you to trade on the exchange rather than the other way around. And I think, again, that's a very different approach that Jeff took to other exchanges, where pretty much every single of the decks that existed before would just be, you know, farming incentives out to these market makers who are basically just treating it as a large farm, basically, to sort of like farm and dump the token. And I think his approach to actually just say, \"We're only going to like focus on the true real users who are like retail takers,\" and then make them rich from the airdrop, and then created this incredible, you know, community of real genuine users, and everything sort of falls downstream of that. So I think that that was probably the two biggest pieces, which was the best product, and then I think they focused on the most important user group, which is like retail tokens.\n\nSo what do you think about Jeff's decision to kind of move away from being an app chain, right? Very clear value proposition for Hyperlquid. It knows the trade-offs it's making. It's happy about them to, you know, becoming an ecosystem, HyperVM, increasing the validator set. What do you think these are the right trade-offs to make, or what are your thoughts?\n\nUm, yeah, I think up to a point, I think it's helpful to decentralize beyond the team running full validators, but I think if they continue to do that, it actually worsens the product. So, I think in a strange sense, you actually want to find this like optimum where it's like not just the team, but not like fully decentralized like everything else. Um, I don't know. I didn't actually spend too much time thinking about the Hyper EVM. I think the core business that they've got there is really the exciting piece, and I think it can be a bit of a distraction as well. Um, there isn't a ton that I've seen on the EVM that I think is, you know, unique or zero to one type ideas. Um, a lot of it is just stuff that you find in other chains that have sort of come over there. So, uh, yeah, I think the piece that's most interesting to me is the exchange and how that continued to sort of grow relative to centralized exchanges. And I don't spend that much time thinking about, um, yeah, what's going on in the EVM.\n\nYeah, I think on that, on this specific point, um, this actually aligns with exactly the overarching vision and the principles that has been driving the, you know, extremely, uh, sort of massive makeover and transition of Maker, transforming into Sky, and in many ways, sort of also taking this step of like rethinking itself from like a sort of product protocol to more like an ecosystem protocol. Eventually, uh, all DeFi, and in the long run, all organizations, like all forms of, like, I guess you could say, like, capitalized or financialized, um, economic activity, uh, will undergo this process, which I just think of as being generalization, basically. And the reason for this is, I mean, the, I guess, the sort of the most, the kind of the most, uh, direct reason is like the technological singularity and AGI and AI trends, basically. It used to be that in the past, uh, you need to sort of specialize because there's like a limit to how much stuff humans can keep in their brains, basically, and they have to kind of like, you want to keep a small, lean team so you can like execute really well in something and do really well in what this particular area. But what's happening now is like, now you need as much data as you possibly can to basically constantly adapt to the environment because you're competing against entities that are doing the same thing, right? They're like gathering all data systematically, processing it, and then adapting.\n\nJust take the example of the, uh, like the hyperlquid, um, retail flow. Uh, I don't, I mean, that right now is probably one of the strongest modes you can possibly imagine in, uh, in crypto today is having that kind of retail that keeps turning up. But it's not going to be a long time until they're using agents or something like that to like optimize, uh, how they manage their funds, right? And like, and those that don't do this, they're just going to lose all the capital, and they're, they're just not going to remain in the game long term. And so everything becomes this like super efficient, uh, optimized, uh, capital allocation problem. Um, and the way you compete in that type of environment is you do the same thing everyone else is doing: you gather as much generalized data as possible, and you try to kind of adapt to all opportunities, and you try to build up as much generalizable network effects.\n\nThis occurred to me about four years ago. Um, and it was actually like, I was sort of thinking about it for a while, and then it all started, like, for me, it sort of clicked when you had the actually the project called FRA, which kept talking about like, \"All road rows lead to fracks,\" and they were like building a whole bunch of stuff, like, I guess the thing they, um, they struggle with, like, this how to systematically sort of ingest data and process it and adapt, like, act in a systematic way, but they did sort of like realize that there's a whole bunch of business models that synergize well with each other, which is probably also what's, I mean, I don't think they're sitting in hyper liquid and pontificating about the singularity or anything like that. They're probably more like observing that there's a bunch of obvious synergies, uh, that can be unlocked if you start to generalize a little bit more. Like this is the type of entity everyone will be competing against in the future.\n\n[Music]\n\nAnd in terms of just generating, you know, both the retail institutional flow, do you, do you think that Sky and also Ethena, like, should it be the front end to do that? Should it be the main UI/UX, or do you, do you prefer when their other applications are maybe more user-friendly, or more applications are plugged into your guys' ecosystem and using that? Like, do you think more users should come from your own front ends or from other front ends as well?\n\nIt depends on, I think, where you are in the life cycle. Like, I think, you know, Ethena and um, Sky, the majority of our users obviously came from DeFi when we're um, sort of maturing as protocols, and then at some stage you have to reach a new user group who's not actually going to be coming on chain and randomly trying to sort of connect to what you're doing. And so I think there's sort of a natural evolution where you go from DeFi, maybe you're the back end for CFI, maybe there's some web two fintech type application where you're just sitting in the background, and then Tradfi is sort of like the final leg there. I think as you're taking each of those steps through those various, um, um, pieces that I was mentioning, you're probably being abstracted more and more into the background, where you're more abandon consumer-facing product. I think you can even just look at Circle or Tether. I've probably been on the website like once in my entire life, uh, and transacted, you know, however much of both of those, um, assets. And so I think in the end, for the products that we're providing, you're probably more in the background than you are trying to sort of own the user as a front end.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I agree. And, uh, I mean, and that also like speaks to the concept of generalization over time. Over time, you should expect retail users to use, you know, highly capable open-source agent frameworks to manage their capital. So you're just going to lo, like, the kind of the stupid, uh, retail revenue, uh, um, potential is going to go away, I think. And that doesn't mean it's not incredibly valuable to go for retail, uh, currently. And that's because, I mean, it's because of like lost funds or like stock funds. So you get this like incredibly like sticky, uh, low-efficiency capital that sort of sticks and accumulates in, uh, in DeFi protocols today. But at some point, you sort of run out of unsophisticated humans, uh, and instead the dominant, uh, economic actor becomes basically, um, artificial intelligence agents, right? And that's the real, that's like the real playing field is actually being able to, uh, compete for those. And what's interesting about that is that you can really think of that as like hyperrational actors, right? So, um, that type of customer is what's today usually referred to as mercenary capital, right? And actually, most DeFi protocols, they are, they kind of don't, you know, they kind of deliberately are trying to avoid the mercenary capital, and like, they don't want that. They, they want the organic, uh, the organic user, but in the kind of the long run, the marginal user is hyperrational mercenary capital. Users will no longer be inter, like, they're just not going to go on some website to manage their money, right? They're going to, they're going to control their, like, they're going to own their own interface, and they're going to have these models basically calculate for them what's the, what's the right move to make.\n\nOnce we approach this future of just AI agents competing for, you know, same yield or same products, isn't it just going to like crowd the products even more because the the smarter the agents, like, the more they will just go to for the same things? Um, sort of similar to the issue with Ethena is that like, more you utilize these strategies, the the less yields that there will be, or do you think that that's kind of a fixed that that will fix itself in the future?\n\nToday, you can, you can really differentiate through brand and front end, and that is going to be super, like, that is the right move to focus on that, and that is like a big part of of the battle plan for Sky because the Sky framework enables the the stars, right, the kind of the economic agents that go out and capture users. It enables them to target all these different demographics and experiment with different types of apps and rapidly innovate on on like retail and like human user acquisition, right? Um, but the reason why you want that is because you want to build up that sticky capital. You want to build up that gigantic war chest of capital because the endgame is just like pure economies of scale, uh, and basically sort of recursive self-improvement of your underlying infrastructure and efficiency. It's going to come down to something like fundamental trust, like you have some, you subscribe to some paradigm of, like, let's say you like really trust the West or something, right? And then that's your sort of ground truth, then probably all these products win that they will be like effectively equivalent, or maybe even there will be a single winner, uh, that just like dominates everything else in economies of scale. If that's the case, of course, our goal is that should be Sky, that's how we designed it, but that's also seems like naive to just assume that like, I mean, there's, I feel like that's been a big failure in crypto this whole time is people always tend to think this like winner takes all stuff, and they do all sorts of kind of, uh, yeah, jumping around, sort of dealing with that instead of just being like executing and and focusing on the on the next steps, and then what you end up seeing is actually there's like this natural, um, you know, stratification and and constantly room for disruption.\n\nYeah, on my side, I have less comments around the, um, AI agents. I think just to the comment you were making around, is it a concern if too much capital comes in and sort of compresses the rate? I think, um, it, it's been something that people sort of said since we came out, like, in the beginning, I think rates were like 60% or something when Ethena came out, and they were like, \"Aren't you worried that's going to come down?\" And, uh, it's the opposite. It's kind of like, that's the point, which is you've identified that this number is too high, and you need more capital to come in to get it to a level that makes sense and is some sort of equilibrium. And it's the same as any financial market on earth when, I don't know, an American bank is looking at Australia and thinking that mortgage rates are too high there. Your response isn't, \"Uh, I think rates are going to come down.\" It's, \"How do I get as much money as possible to push those rates down and then create some value for yourself while you do that?\"\n\nYeah. I mean, the thing is that Ethena is, I mean, like, it's like a sort of, it's a noble pursuit, right, for something like Ethena to come in and be like, \"This is stupid, you know, this is so inefficient.\" What's basically happening is there were a bunch of like hedge funds that were just making obscene profits. These crypto-based companies coming in and being like, \"Hey, we can do this.\" They're literally just the first to discover this after there's been these like generations of bankers just, you know, colluding to keep it, keep like hiding the alpha, basically, and and as a result, making everybody else worse off while they are basically buying like yachts and private jets or whatever, right? And I mean, basically, our whole economy is like rigged in this way, right? So, uh, that's that's going to be really like really cool, right? So, there might be some downsides such as low yields or whatever, but the upside is like literally societal transformation through the tech we've all been like grinding on for all these years, right? And messing around with and like our little hobby basement, uh, nerd stuff, right? And now that's potentially going to really have a positive impact on the world. Uh, and I mean, obviously, Ethena holders have done well and so on, right? The big difference with something like Ethena coming in and just generally kind of opening up and and fixing this market and making it more efficient, it's going to translate into like higher Bitcoin prices in general and higher Ethereum prices in general, which to me seems like that's a that's like a social benefit, right? That's like actually going to benefit, uh, global financial stability and and resilience. So we've gone from, uh, private jets just for the bankers to private just for crypto hedge funds, and now it's private just for Ethena holders, and and absolutely now. So it's it's the right direction.\n\n[Music]\n\nWe are definitely seeing an increasing maturity of like DeFi, right? And with that, you know, it's really exciting. You have RWAs, etc., etc. And the way I see Ethena and the way I see ENA in particular is effectively like, you know, there's this basis trade. The basis trade is I would push back. I don't think it's just like, you know, these bankers somewhere had found this trick and just like made a bunch of themselves rich. They made every single credit investor who wanted to participate in this trade rich, right? And it was very much available to a lot of people. Now, not everyone, and not nearly at the same level of ease as it being back to a stable coin. Hence why I think Ethena is so cool. Um, but it was possible, and as we're seeing, you know, TradFi coming into crypto, you know, recently Apollo had their private credit, uh, fund come on chain, we are going to see more and more financial instruments come on chain, and with that, a lot more strategies, uh, opportunities which let's say weren't available.\n\n\nFor the vast majority of people, but with that also comes like KYC, right? And the additional regulation which is associated with like these um traditional institutions coming on chain. So like the Polar Credit is a great one. It's fully KYC. I guess my question to you guys is, you know, as we see DeFi mature and we see crypto mature, what will the role of KYC have to play in it, and how does that follow with those original ideological uh values which Rune, you kind of alluded to earlier today?\n\nWell, so first of all, KYC versus something like the alternative versus which is like the blacklist or something like that. You can't like derive uh how it works from first principles, right? It's sort of like arbitrary based on interpretation of regulations from different countries intersecting weirdly, right? In a in sometimes unpredictable ways. But there seems to be one uh particular sort of guiding principle uh which is that the more you diversify and the more you decentralize and the less you have sort of central points of failure uh the less likely it is that stakeholders in sort of the chain, the value chain, will feel the pressure, feel the risk from uh from uh from some particular uh regulation that would make them uh require KYC versus something like uh freeze capabilities, like retroactive capabilities.\n\nJust to pick up on one earlier comment that you made, Namik, I think uh on the Ethena piece specifically, uh yes, people had been doing this for a while, but it's a trade itself is like the least interesting piece of this. I think it's actually a good analogy here is actually like staked ETH. So yes, anyone can go and participate in staking ETH, but there's $30 billion sitting in Lido right now. And the question that comes after that is why if you can go do it yourself? And I think it's actually like the collateral use case and like the magic that's actually unlocked when you tokenize something, put it into different systems, uses Lego through DeFi collateral to trade other things within CFI. And so that's actually like the the piece here which is the unlock, which is it's not about the basis trade because yes, people have been doing it forever. It's putting it in a format where it's useful, can be levered up, and you know, things like as a very basic example, taking it and using it as on Ave to borrow dollars and sort of like lever the trade that is something that simply you cannot do if you're a hedge fund trying to do it yourself on a centralized exchange. It was just like a net new use case that was created outside of it. Uh so yeah, that was just one comment I wanted to make on something you said earlier.\n\nUm yeah, I think the piece you're getting to about here which is like direction of DeFi, where does this all go? Um it does feel like DeFi is sort of going in two different directions. You sort of got this reg arb sort of side of it where you're doing things where if you went and asked for permission to do them now, you probably wouldn't have been given an okay. And I think even like the basic idea of a stable coin itself probably wouldn't exist right now if someone went and asked for permission to launch the first one like right now, if that makes sense. You're kind of giving like non KYC access to the dollar to the rest of the world. And if you just say that one liner there, it doesn't really sound like something that people would be accepting of if you came with it as a as a new idea now. And so I think a lot of the things that actually exist and are useful within DeFi sort of all have this flavor of of being in regard in in some perspective. But then when you start to get into like the land of like pure securities, uh it starts to get a bit harder, I think, for people to be able to digest that and sort of justify ignoring those rules like entirely. And so I do think that we're going to see a sort of divergence in DeFi in some respects where some applications might run two different front ends. One which is like if you're touching these assets and actually interacting with XY Z private credit fund or equities, whatever it is, you need to have some sort of proof that that you have sort of provided KYC in some ways. I think there's interesting work that's being done on sort of ZK passport, ZK identity type stuff uh where you can actually just carry that around with you on chain to sort of unlock that. Uh but I do I do think it's quite hard actually for people to fully ignore all of those aspects when you start to touch real securities um not just like crypto assets uh going forward.\n\nUm I think there are interesting areas though if we think about that middle ground between uh treasuries and every other credit asset that exists um in in the world. Uh, one interesting thing that I think both Sky and Ethena have provided is like if you actually look at the distribution for who's holding Bidd Rock on chain, um, I'm pretty sure Rune might have more accurate numbers here. Between the two of us, there's 90% of the owners are basically sitting here on this call. Um, and I think that that's actually a pretty strong demonstration that uh, you know, basically the demand for these assets actually are derived from being put in more useful places. So if you're holding a T-bill just sitting on chain, that's not actually fundamentally very useful thing. Like it's actually higher risk than holding it in your in your own account sort of sitting within trad. Uh the thing that is actually useful is putting it in a format where it can then be used as collateral and sort of integrate into different systems. And I think the the piece that's interesting about both of our sort of projects is that we've opened up the Overton window of what else you can start to put within dollar-based assets and be used in interesting places. And it wouldn't be surprising to me where in a different rate environment going forward where Tedles just look less interesting as an asset, you start to see experimentation around different um axes around duration, liquidity, and return with a bunch of these different assets. So my view is that actually hybrid dollar assets like the you know, the products that we have will actually be the by far the largest driver of all of the demand for RWA going forward and it's less about like individuals coming and saying I really want to hold this KYC private asset that's sitting on train.\n\nThere's like multiple points here that I think are really interesting and a sort of putting them all together kind of brings us back to the original uh question or like the starting point of like what like why is DeFi different now and how has it gotten really real, right? And really blockchain, what's the point of blockchain, right? Because basically, I mean, so what the thing that sort of triggered me just now, right, was when you said you and like the two of us here are holding 90% of the Biddle uh assets, right, which is obviously not remotely the case, right? It's it's it's protocols that we were part of building, but that ultimately are like, you know, they are not as ideologically purist decentralized as, you know, people like me were envisioning back in the early Bitcoin maxi days, but they still are decentralized. Like they're actual blockchain-based smart contract secured protocols. And that does make them like vastly more decentralized, vastly more transparent uh and reliable and sort of requiring of less trust than like I mean any kind of like trady banker middleman type of structure from from time immemorial, right, of how finance has always worked up until this point. Like that's blockchain, that's what blockchain exists to do, that is the core value proposition that it offers, and it's the reason why it's going to like take over the whole world. It's really about liquidity. Like it's I mean that's the the underlying characteristic is the liquidity, right? Liquidity sort of means everyone's using this, everyone's accepting it, everybody understands this. So you can use it as collateral everywhere. You can like pay with it. You can settle with it. You can you you can hold it, you can give it to somebody and they'll hold it for a while without worrying whether it has any value at all. Right? You can only do that with blockchain. Like you can't do that if it's some like slip of paper from some banker guy in like New York or something saying, \"Yeah, totally trust me. This piece of paper is totally super valuable.\" Like nobody would ever accept that, right, as collateral unless they like knew that guy in particular. So that's why the old world was all these like sort of closed off opaque networks of trust around like some banker that bought somebody else a yacht or something, right? And then that's the reason why there's a bunch of trust and there's a bunch of like there's sort of liquidity between in these networks, right? Now in the blockchain world suddenly you have somebody like Guy that like just like yeah yeah yeah we're going to do like the hedge fund thing and we're just going to like build the gigantic system everybody can use as collateral. I mean and we I think in in Sky we are we are pushing for this to happen, right? And we are sort of participating in this that we want of course Ethena to be more and more transparent and sort of more and more like it should be easier over time to really verify the end to end risk and security and so on and and and there is a like there's a clear kind of evolution in that direction because everybody involved wants this to happen because it's like the new it's the new paradigm. Um, and and and this is what I was talking about earlier about like this is just how everybody is going to be competing now. So there's just no space for like gatekeepers anymore. Like now the new play is of cut, you know, cut your margin to to zero or even negative and then just focus on economies of scale because that gets you to that sort of the thing you're really looking for which is the liquidity, the kind of the dominant market position where the whole market they like trust that you're not going to ruck them and they trust that you're not that you're like you're going to make give them a good deal, right? You're going to take very low margins and that's the kind of basis for why the market as a whole buys into this and and sort of chooses like Lido and like Ethena and USDS and so on as like the go-to assets where liquidities and and and um like collateral status is is given. Again, like I was saying earlier, this is just the beginning, right? Like we're scratching the surface of this because it's like a it's like a paradigm shift that's going to change like every industry and every aspect of society that is about capitalization and financialization.\n\n[Music]\n\nSo, one thing I want to quickly touch on is like we're we're building these systems for the new world, but we're definitely letting the old world come in alongside, right? Like that's where the vast majority of liquidity is. So, you know, there's obviously MicroStrategy. Uh there's a new one for Ethereum, there's the one for Solana. I'm hearing more and more rumors of MicroStrategy as a service emerging, right? So, how do you guys see that? Um I'm curious if Guy, do you have any opinions on this? Um do you ever see a world where there's like a MicroStrategy for Ethena, for ENA? Uh there was like a um spack thing. I don't know if you saw a couple of months ago which uh there's actually a submission from a spa uh to basically make a vehicle around Dino. I think um taking one step back and commenting less around like us uh it does remind me a little bit of um that sort of roller coaster youth in Asia roller coaster that like has diminishing returns through time where you always see like the second and third and fourth one just you know have less impact. Um I think it's actually interesting to look at the trading as well, like for the guys that came out and announced this recently, they traded down uh pretty aggressively on the news. Um I I think the issue here is that uh whenever it sort of like appears as a free money game to sort of capture this AR between where things are trading and the underlying BTC, it's like one of those very obvious things in retrospect when we look back at the end of the cycle saying like did this make sense that everyone was sort of running around and then automatically 1.5xing or 2xing uh the NAV of these vehicles. So I don't think it's sustainable in any way. Uh I do think the one exception here is actually Sailor and there's a there is actually a very good reason for why it does trade at a premium to NAV which is he's got efficient financing to own levered BTC without liquidation risk and that is worth more than the underlying BTC. Uh I don't think that that's worth 2, 3, 4x which is kind of where I was trading uh back in November, but there is definitely you know premium that's warranted for being able to get le exposure which is not the same thing as buying IBIT within within BlackRock.\n\nUh, I do think like for other assets, um, I think TradFi just has less interest in everything else that's going on if I'm being honest. Like look at the ETH flows. I think that they were, um, incredibly disappointing even on like a relative basis. Uh, completely underperformed everything that you saw with uh, BTC. And I don't think that there's any reason that someone looks at Solana or any other list of like assets that come afterwards. I think the piece that we found slightly interesting about a potential vehicle for what we're doing is that uh dollar assets, stable coin issuance, that kind of stuff is I think one of the most uh important themes of what's happening this cycle and I think it's one of the very few things that TradFi has actually latched on to as this is a killer use case. This is a graph that's just going up and to the right uh uh into the future and there isn't actually that many ways to get exposure to that outside of Circle's potential IPO that's coming. Um and so I think if there are very specific thematics where trady hasn't got access to a trade and you can sort of provide them that trade in a package sort of almost mimemetic format that they can sort of get exposure to that. I think there is something interesting there, but it's not at like the size and scale that people are doing these um uh MicroStrategy copycats and I think that the demand for this ETH vehicle in particular is going to be um disappointing like the ETFs as well.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I think you're spot on, Guy, with uh like it's there's something unique about Bitcoin and access to cheap financing for Bitcoin because with ETH and with every other asset, ENA and so on. I mean, if you look at borrowing rates and sort of terms when you collateralize crypto assets offchain versus onchain, you're got I mean, the deal you're going to get uh is just so much better if you do it onchain, right? So it's really easy to get good leverage for ENA because there's like a gigantic hyperefficient um you know, fully worked ecosystem to tab into in in DeFi, right, where you can get that with Bitcoin is like you have to\n\n\nGo through like a custodian, and you know, like with MicroStrategy, like you get the whole thing in one. You get the custodian, you get the leverage, you get it all in one easy-to-understand, easy-to-use package, and that's unique for Bitcoin. It's more like a downside of Bitcoin that it is not fully exposed to DeFi, but it's just so big as an asset that the kind of the cost of then wrapping it all in a company like strategy because they become sort of vanishingly small, you know, because the Bitcoin itself is just such a big market.\n\nDo you guys think that the demand for Bitcoin, and I completely agree with you, Guy, that there's just so much more interest for Bitcoin versus everything else? Do you think that ever leads to like some economic activity existing on Bitcoin, whether that's stablecoins or protocols like both of you guys are building on some sort of actual permissionless layer 2, or is that just for ETH and Solana?\n\nI have a less strong view on like the BTC L2 sort of ideas. I think it seemed like something that people were trying to make happen like a year ago, and then it doesn't seem to be like interest in like genuinely building on that. I just don't really see what the user unlock is for doing that. Like it's there's an ideological element to this, which is like, \"Oh, it's cool to build on Bitcoin,\" but it's not clear to me how you get the user to actually leave me Ethena and go over to some Bitcoin L2. And I think that every property of Bitcoin makes it kind of a worse place to go and build what what they're building. So yeah, it's unclear to me.\n\nOne semi-interesting idea though is there's obviously this whole sort of like thought process around what happens with tail emissions and that kind of stuff with BTC in the end, and how do we sort of get come towards that. Um, yeah, it's maybe an interesting thought experiment, which is like what happens if BlackRock owns like 20% of the BTC and it's literally just owned by TradFi? Maybe there is like an economic incentive enough from the fee stream that's being generated off of the asset management fees on ETFs for them to sort of just like secure themselves. Yeah, exactly. And when it's like so widely just owned by these enormous businesses that have just found like a different income stream, which is sort of like delivering it to people in some sort of digestible format, maybe that's a solution, but it wasn't really like the original vision for everything.\n\n[Music]\n\nSo we have a pretty fun way to end the episode today. We have a segment called F.A.F.O. around find out thesis as you guys walk us through what you're doing on chain. What are some cool things you guys have seen? Feel free to show something that you're building or something that you just think is interesting. We can start to learn.\n\nUh, so um, just a couple of days ago, Sky migrated its governance back end from the MKR token to the Sky token, which is like a gigantic upgrade. So you that sort of means, you know, moving the whole like sort of security backbone. Uh, and and uh, yeah, that that was just that was a huge upgrade of like many months in the works, and you know, if if handled incorrectly, would have been very risky to do, but uh, now that it's successfully been done with no issues as we expected, uh, it it opens the door to Sky staking, which is a feature we've wanted to release for like a really, really long time. Something that that there's been, you know, talks about in the Sky ecosystem for for years, right? It was like one of the main drivers of like maker is going to upgrade to Sky, and then you'll be able to stake your Sky tokens, but there was just a lot of these sort of technical considerations holding it back. So uh, what I basically did was I upgraded my MKR this guy and then sort of locked it into the staking engine.\n\nUm, initially there will be staking rewards in the form of USDS of like like right out of the gate, it'll be like 250,000 USDS per day distributed across all the Sky stakers. What's coming next is that you have SPK. So SP, the Sparkst Star, so the first Sky agent that's been, you know, it's like the second largest lending market and doing a bunch of cool stuff, and they have a big campaign going right now with airdrops and and that kind of stuff leading up to their launch, which then also results in their token, I mean, sorry, their token launch, which results in that token being farmable for USCs holders, but also becoming available as a reward for Sky Stakers. And and after Spark, there'll be multiple other stars coming out. And all of these initial very large in-house incubated stars coming out of of the Sky ecosystem, they're all going to distribute their their tokens to Sky Stakers alongside this USDS staking reward.\n\nOne of the other features coming from the staking engine is also that you'll be able to actually directly collateralize that sky and so access like, you know, generate USDS and lever up on the sky, lever up on the staking yield if you want to. And this kind of like goes a little bit back to the whole MicroStrategy thing that is sort of like in Sky, there's sort of like a MicroStrategy as a service built into the token itself where sort of it's all packaged together, right? The staking rewards, uh, the access to uh to uh leverage, uh, and all of this is of course done in a way that in like that insulates USDS and and the broader Sky protocol from the from the risk that is is is built, you know, that inherently exists whenever you use leverage in a in in a position like this.\n\nYeah, I'm uh not doing that much on chain, uh, just quite busy day-to-day um with Ethena. I think uh the thing that we brought a market in, I think both Rud and I uh did a reasonable size scale, which I thought was pretty interesting, was um when PT when PTS from Pendle were sort of first enabled on money markets. I just thought it was one of the coolest sort of like examples of uh like the DeFi money Lego thesis sort of coming together where you had Ethena importing a rate from CFI in chain into into USD. Pendle then taking like a floating rate of interest making a fixed rate uh product. Then you had Sky uh lending into Morpho where people could use a fixed rate product to lever it up as like a floating rate borrow. And it was just this incredible sort of like four different projects within uh DeFi all bringing their like unique skill set together, and then you created something which was just literally never done before, and it went to a billion dollars within like two days basically in terms of like what you had unlocked, and to me it was just kind of one of the best examples that we've seen since 2020 of uh like composability just unlocking like net new things, and uh I still think to this day that whole sort of trade right now people have been doing it on our pretty consistently now to generate 20 to 25% return on dollars even when uh the market's down uh pretty considerably in terms of rates, and I think on like a risk adjusted basis, it's kind of one of the most interesting things that you can do at scale with uh with dollars.\n\nAwesome. So when will you be trading on Ethereal? That'll be some onchain activity.\n\nWhen uh that's going to be live, uh, it's actually next week. I've already had some people coming through and uh using private test nets. Um, I I don't do a bunch of trading right now. I'll just hold some spots and uh pretty boring.\n\nYou're not tempted to pull a James win.\n\nMaybe for Mark. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of does make you wonder, you know, what was the reason behind doing all that. But anyway, guys, uh, thank you so much for for coming on the podcast. Thank you so much for chatting with us. This was quite insightful, and um, love to have you on at some point again.\n\nCool. Nice guys. Thanks for hosting us.\n\n[Music]\n",
