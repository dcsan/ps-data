Well, before we get into it, just a quick note. If you're hiring in crypto, check out campus out of all your candidates. It will help you pick out the real crypto natives. Head to theblock.co/campus to get a three-month free trial. Now, today's episode is about crypto going crosschain. So Wormhole has seen a lot of growth in uh asset transfer volume, institutional integrations. What has been the main sort of driver behind this growth?\nYeah, I think so. If you think about, maybe we take a four or five-year step back, uh, we very much so viewed the world, or or maybe the consensus, the thought, main thought at the time was actually that everything was going to exist on one chain. Once upon a time in our journey of building Wormhole, that was kind of the school of thought we were up against. It was a lot of people that actually didn't believe that there was a need to connect multiple chains. They didn't believe that there would be multiple chains. Um, it was a lot of specifically, you know, the everything will kind of settle to Ethereum. Um, and over the years, we've kind of seen that slowly become evolve and and and become debunked. I think there was a period of time where it was like, well, there will be a fragmented multichain world, but it'll still all settle to Ethereum. And then now I think we're we're very, very much so in this period of time where all right, there's going to be a lot of blockchains. Solana is, you know, arguably one of the more used and popular ones right now. It's not even kind of all the focused on Ethereum. Um, and there's other big ones like Sui coming up, obviously Monad, there's Barerchain, etc. Um, so now we're kind of to this world where it, we are absolutely multichain. And so if you think about if you're an application, so you're a developer building something onchain, um, you are an asset, right? We we have a lot of stablecoins. We have a lot of institutions that issue something on chain. The the funny thing about blockchains is you're beholden to kind of the that ecosystem, right? The the users, the apps, the liquidity of that one ecosystem. So that could be Solana, that could be Ethereum. You're only accessing one. You're deploying your contracts or whatever your logic is and you're accessing like just one. And so if you really want to be successful and you want to open up whatever application or business or asset you're you're developing on chain, the best way to to get the largest market uh is to build or issue across all of these chains. And so what we're kind of seeing is this this evolution of from over the past four or five years of you know block, everything's going to be on one chain, there's not going to be multiple, to there's multiple, but it'll be on Ethereum, now there's you know, there's multiple and there are all different types of virtual machines and now we're starting to see more and more adoption, especially institutional, and they want to be on all the chains. I think like the last thing I'll say on this is, um, you know, the concept onchain should mean all the chains. Like I think some blockchains, Base for instance, and this, you know, we work closely with them, this is just something they will say, not an attack, but they'll say onchain meaning Base, but I would push this a little further, meaning onchain does just mean you're across all the chains or at least across some chains, and I think we're starting to see kind of that critical uh adoption on specifically needing to be across all these chains if you want to be successful in building something on blockchain.\nAnd are you seeing any growth in any particular chains recently in terms of like people moving assets to that chain? I'm just curious about Hyperliquid, like I know people are starting to build projects there. If you're seeing sort of growth there.\nYeah, absolutely. I think Hyperliquid is the current darling or the uh, you know, the the new kid in high school, if you will. Not really new anymore, but um, they're definitely, it's definitely that moment in time where we're seeing a lot of activity on Hyperliquid. We actually are launching Hyperliquid, um, uh, I believe in the next week and a half. Um, so we'll start to push a lot of flows towards Hyperliquid. Um, but we we see still see a lot of flows on some of these like the main ones. And one thing I'll say too, Tim, is that there's a common misconception that like you, I I sometimes I see like uh certain providers say 100 chains, 110 chains, and there's definitely that many, but the activity onchain activity is actually, I think, like 95% or something like that. And this is kind of a finger-in-the-ear number is across probably like the top 12 chains. It's very like 80/20. And so we see a lot of flows between Solana still, uh, you know, Arbitrum, Base, Sui, Hyperliquid, of course, but it's kind of that, it remains that kind of like top 10 almost, how some people would think about like the coin market cap top 10, uh, is kind of the same same with blockchain.\nAre you seeing much activity on on Sui? Like I'm starting to see people talk about a little bit more um recently, but I haven't really like used the ecosystem that much. Yeah, I think when so what we kind of monitor is we look at flows between blockchains and um with Sui in particular, we see a lot of flows there. I think they're probably, we did like a 2024 wrapped um, and it's kind of like when everyone was doing the Spotify wrap thing. Sui was our top, that was top three, I think that, yeah, the third largest inflows of any chain. Um, so meaning like users sending assets onto the chain to do, you know, something on the chain, whatever it is, it could be DeFi, it could be some sort of game, etc. So just based on that, and this obviously was towards the end of last year, we still kind of seen, seen the same behavior. We're definitely seeing inflows there. Um, what it exactly is for, you know, is is a, I think, a more of an open question, but I know Sui's recently launched a lot of homegrown protocols, um, Walrus, Deep, etc., that have have seen some success, launch their own tokens, and that's really when a when an ecosystem starts to hit that critical mass as well, right? Like a blockchain launches its own tokens, but when you go through that evolution of those the DeFi apps built on that blockchain also launching tokens, it's this like positive flywheel, um, and Sui is kind of going through that moment right now. Solana obviously had that. Barerchain hasn't even gone through that, I would argue. Um, so I think it's it's definitely a good, good time pursuing.\nYeah. And are there any like crypto apps you've been sort of playing around with recently that you know, you found quite interesting?\nYeah. I I think, um, so one thing I I've been focusing on a lot, because this is a lot of uh where we've found strong product market fit, is um real world assets. We say real world assets, we say institutions. I think you know, maybe what does that that mean? Um, you know, a lot of it is is tokenizing securities today, a lot of it's money markets in particular. Um, I have recently, you know, taken a position with it with private credit, you know, we can maybe get into this in a little bit, but I think private credit on chain is like a meaningful use case that blockchain or tokenization can provide that you know, you couldn't get with maybe in a traditional market. So I I token or I um, tokenized some private credit and then I've I've just been toying around with what it the experience is to go from this KYC tokenization protocol. So we I did this via Securitize, we work closely with them, to then using it in a money market onchain. Um, and so I kind of went through the end-to-end process of effectively just looping my position. Um, so doing this on Morpho and Polygon, actually. Um, shout out to that team. And, uh, you know, it's obviously looping on a money market is nothing new, but I think just the the novelty or the using an actual RWA, I thought was was something I wanted to try because I you don't actually see it that much, right? We talk a lot about tokenization and it's happening. I think tokenization AUM is probably around 30 or like TVL is probably like 30 billion on chain today. So, it's definitely gone up. Um, but seeing it in DeFi, I think, is still where that next kind of catalyst or next wave is happening. So, there's only a few select use cases for tokenization in DeFi today, actually. So, um, that that's that's mainly what I've been focused on. It's still pretty clunky process. Um, but it does ultimately work, but it's a lot of like manually, someone's manually managing the position, etc. So, um, I've been focused a lot on that kind of the actual intersection of you know, these like tokenized securities and using them in DeFi.\nOkay. And why would someone want to tokenize their credit? Like what are the the advantages there?\nYeah. I think I think when it comes to the asset class of of private credit, it is an asset class that has been effectively, you know, I'm going to use some just in this use, spirit of time, like I'm going to use some broad strokes, effectively been gated for very high net worth individuals. So it's an asset class if you wanted to invest in, usually involves maybe some sort of lockup, but in return, you get some sort of higher, higher yield, of course, you know, risk-adjusted, etc., etc., but the way in which you get access to typically like a private credit investment, uh, you know, some big, big private credit uh funds are like Apollo, Hamilton Lane, I believe KKR has a has a big private credit fund too, uh, the way you kind of get access is, first, you you need some sort of like um, broker, right? Like man, financial manager there. There's usually minimums involved there, right? So, you have, first of all, you have to be able to get the financial advisor or the the what have you in order to be able to buy this this asset vehicle. So, there's lots of different minimums, lots of difference requirements for all these different brokers, you know, but there is some sort of minimum, right? So, that all instantly gates some some people. And then to actually invest in the the the um asset vehicle itself, there's also a minimum there. um, a minimum could be, it could be $500,000. I think that's actually like pretty, pretty normal, right? And so then you you probably take out the majority of the population that with that, um, and so when you think about bringing something on chain and being able to kind of fractionalize it, um, and have kind of these offer these secondary markets, more liquidity, etc., uh, you open up kind of the TAM of investor class that can invest in this. Um, and so I think we talk a lot about over the years with crypto, like democratizing finance. I think it makes a lot of sense for stablecoins. We've done a good job, right? We're like exporting the power of the dollar to certain countries where people get paid something and the value of their money between paychecks goes down 15%. Like that's insane. So, like there is a cool democratizing of finance happening with stablecoins. I don't think anyone's arguing with that at this point. But I think I think private credit's also interesting too because this investment that you know, we always hear the terms, the rich get richer. These investments that like these high net worth individuals have access to and maybe others don't. We kind of open up the TAM there. Um, and so you know, you could buy Apollo private credit or or Hamilton Lane private, I think is $10,000 now. So we're going, we went from a a broker and half a million dollars to $10,000. So there's still a minimum, but like, come on, that's gone down significantly. And so that that to me is pretty exciting. Um, and I think kind of helps deliver on some of these like promises we talk about so much with with crypto and blockchain.\nSure thing. And what is Wormhole doing in the tokenized uh equities or sort of you know, real-world space?\nYeah, absolutely. So, uh, we are effectively moving all these assets between the chains. So, why is that important? There's kind of two two reasons. Number one, um, what fund managers, talking a little bit more specifically, we say institutions, a lot of them today are these these large fund managers. What what what they want is uh, you know, they want assets under management to grow. So, they want more people investing in the products. And so they we the and this is the first bucket. They actually view uh crypto now as an asset class, right? You have a lot of people that want to invest in things that are onchain or within this kind of crypto realm, if you will. And so when you think about, let's say I'm a fund and I'm issuing on one blockchain, I really like, yes, there's a lot of users that use multiple blockchains, but there's you know, it's still pretty sticky. So, if they're issuing on Solana, they're only getting access to those users or those investors as they view them. So, they want like the 2.5 whatever trillion market cap market of crypto, not the like what's beholden to one blockchain. So, we help make sure that any asset issued on chain can be on multiple blockchains. There is like some nuance in the sense that like the blockchains have to be approved and certain things have to be deployed on the other ones. But in general, we're expanding the TAM for them so more people can invest. So, you can buy Bidd, let's say on Solana, but you can also buy it on Arbitrum, Aptos, Polygon, Ethereum, etc. The second bucket is this kind of going back to this DeFi concept. So, uh, if you, let's say, hold the majority of your assets on Ethereum for whatever reason, you have a multisig there, etc. But we know that DeFi apps, you know, are different across multiple different blockchains. You know, Athena's on Ethereum mainnet, um, there's Drifter on on Solana. um, you wanted to use one of these DeFi protocols. Let's say I had, I don't know, $50,000 worth of Bidd on Ethereum. I wanted to long my Bidd or use it as collateral. Let's say not long, use it as\n\n\nCollateral on Drift on\nSalana. I could keep, let's say, 25,000 on\nEthereum, and I could send 25,000 to\nSalana, and then I could take a position\nthere. And this way, you're not like\nhaving to sell it on the secondary\nmarket for cash and then going and\nbuying it on Salana and buying Bidd, etc.\nSo it makes it, it makes the flow of\nfunds much easier, reduces a lot of\nfriction. But what the behavior we\ntypically see is using those assets\nwithin D5 protocols.\nOkay. And it seems that institutional\nadoption seems to be quite a big role in\nyour strategy. Um, so what's your, I\nguess, what's your main sort of strategy\nthere in terms of finding success\nwith the institutions?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah. Um, I think there's, I think one\nthing that we always try to do at\nWormhole is one, is to try to be as\nintellectually honest as possible in a\nspace that's kind of mired, but or or\nthat that that has a tendency to not be.\nAnd um, I would say the second thing\nis, um, making sure that the\nI would say, I'd say with, with, yeah, with\ninstitutions, we, we, we like to target the\ntokenization platforms today. Um,\nbut I think what I was, what I was trying\nto say was, like, we like to target real\nuse cases. Um, and so being honest about\nwhat those, those real use cases are, I\nthink is something that that is\nimportant to us. So we, I think we went\nthrough this period in, like, 2020, 2021,\nwhere we talked a lot about\ninstitutions. You guys, you, you probably\nremember this, Tim, where it was like, the\ninstitutions are coming, the institutions\nare coming. Lo and behold, it actually\ndidn't happen for a number of years\nafter that. You could argue that, like,\nFTX kind of set us back as an industry,\nand that's probably why. I think that's\nan acceptable argument. Um, but I think\nfor us, we, we try to understand what is,\nwhat are the real use cases today, and\nthen target those. And and the real use\ncases today are tokenizing kind of, like,\npretty rudimentary, like, asset vehicles.\nWe talked about money markets, we talked\nabout private credit. Um, and so today\nthe strategy is, you know, these\ntokenization platforms often act as, like,\ngatekeepers to the relationships of\nthese institutions and also the way in\nwhich these institutions issue anything\nonchain. So we've, we've done a lot of\nwork, um, with our close partner\nSecuritize, who's, who's, I would say, one\nof the leading tokenization platforms.\nAnd, um, you know, making sure that they\nhave, they have good relationships with\nBlackRock, Apollo, etc. Um, and then\nanything that they're issuing on chain,\nWormhole is being used. So I would say\nthat's kind of, like, one of the\noverarching strategies. Um, and then it's\ntrying to figure out what actual value\ncan a blockchain technology provide and\nbeing honest. You can't, you can't fool\nthese institutions, right? You can't\njust be like, \"Oh, just do it. We'll\nannounce it. We'll figure it out.\" Like,\nwhat actual tangible value can this\ntechnology provide and then going to\nthem with these, with these use cases.\nAnd, um, you know, we have a few things in\nthe work there around, you know, on the\nweekend in traditional markets. Let's\nsay, uh, an institution gets, has cash, but\nthey want to make interest over the\nweekend, but they, the market's closed, so\nthey can't buy anything. Like, how do we\nkind of set up an arbitrage where they\nthey are able to kind of invest in the\ncrypto market, get that interest over\nthe weekend, uh, you know, some something\nlike that, right? Like, bringing these\nkind of, like, interesting use cases where\n24/7 markets or fractionalization or, like,\nthese, these various things that a\nblockchain tech can offer, like, actually\nbenefits these, these institutions at\nmass. Um, so I would say our strategy,\nmaybe just to summarize, is, like, real use\ncases and being intellectually honest.\nLike, these, these institutions appreciate\nthat. They want tangible, here's, you know,\nthe ROI, if you will. Um, and then the\nsecond thing is working with\ntokenization platforms. Like, that's still\nwhere we're at today, is still in this\nkind of, like, tokenization era. Um, it has\nbeen coming for a while, but it really\nnever, nothing was happening until the\npast year, and now focusing on what it\nlooks like to then bring those, those\nRWAs into D5, right? We have 30 billion on\nchain, let's get that into some D5\nprotocols.\nWould you say there's been a big\ndifference in the openness and\nwillingness of institutions to, like, talk\nto crypto projects like Wormhole? Like,\nwhen did, like, did that change, when did\nit change, and and sort of how, how much\nhas it changed their, their approach\nchurch?\nYeah, I would say absolutely. Um,\nI, I, I, I don't want to give all the\ncredit to this, and I think this is kind\nof, like, a copout answer, but I do, I do\nthink that we can't underestimate, like,\nthe US, in terms of, like, a world capital\nmarkets, is, it's, is pretty big. And so I\nthink a lot of these institutions kind\nof have a no BS approach to, they don't\nwant to touch this unless there is some\nsort of regulatory clarity. So I think a\nlot of them have started to get more\ncomfortable. Good example of this is\nafter the Genius Act was passed, I think\nJP Morgan, like, announced that they were\ngoing to do something with the stable\ncoin, right? It's like, as soon as, as\nsoon as there's clarity, these, these, I\nthink these guys are going to start,\nstart getting in in a big way, or they\nare starting to get in a big way. So I, I\nthink we've seen, um, a significantly\nbigger push since this kind of this\nclarity we had last November with the\nadministration shift. I, I would say even\nbefore that, though, we kind of started to\nsee, uh, more, for instance, BlackRock's\nobviously very involved with Securitize,\nyou know, they're a large investor, so\nthey're, they were thinking of a\nthoughtful approach of how do we take\nthis, you know, uh, take advantage of this\ntechnology, but maybe not super directly,\nright? So, like, working closely with, with\nanother provider, um, that they're\nobviously on the uh, cap table of. Um, so I,\nI, I think that we're starting to see,\nlike, we're not even starting to see it,\nthey're here, right? They're here. The,\nthe, the amount of banks and financial\ninstitutions that are tokenizing\nsomething, I, I, I'd be hard, you'd be\nhardressed, let me say this, to find\nsome that haven't announced or haven't\nannounced something. Like, they most have.\nAnd you could say, \"Okay, that's cool.\nThat was, like, 2021, 2022 as well.\" I\nthink you'd be, you know, I think you\ncould find a lot of them, but a lot, a\nlot of them have actually issued\nsomething on chain, right? So, like, JP\nMorgan, um, has issued stuff on Shane,\nBlackRock, Apollo, Hamilton Lane, KKR,\nVan, uh, you know, obviously there's,\nthere's many, like, we have the Middle\nEast cohort is has as well. So I, it's,\nit's, I think we're beyond they're coming\nto, we're to the point that they're here.\nUm, I think we're just at that point\nagain where it's like, what does it look\nlike to actually use this in DeFi and\nand and really grow the pie. If you look\nat the RWA, and I kind of associate this\nwith institutional adoption, RWA.xyz is\na really good resource for this. If you\nlook at, like, RWA on chain, it's just up\nand to the right. Um, which I think is a\ngood indicator of of real adoption.\nAnd how do you think all of this plays\nout over the next 12 months? Do you\nthink it's just more, more companies,\nmore and more projects, they just keep\nexpanding?\nI actually think there's, we're kind of\ngoing through a little bit of a\npotentially consolidation period, and\nmaybe not when it comes to institutions,\nbut I would say when it comes to to\ncrypto, to crypto protocols, to\ncryptonative companies, um, and and also,\nyou know, these larger institutions\ncoming into the space, looking at, you\nknow, what, what can they purchase? I\nthink Stripe's a great example of, we\ncould call them an institution, right?\nBut, like, you know, whatever. They're,\nthey're, they're a non-cryptonative\ncompany that that has a lot of success\nin kind of the traditional market or\ntech space. Um, they've obviously made\ntwo large acquisitions. Um, and we've\nseen Ripple obviously make large\nacquisitions. Uh, Hidden Road is was a\nhuge one. Um, Coinbase is is is making\nsome of these. So, like, I think when it\ncomes to cryptonnative companies, we're\ngoing to actually see continue to see a\nlot of e&amp; um, we're going to see uh,\ncryptonative companies buy cryptonative\ncompanies, and I think we're also going\nto see non-cryptonative companies by\ncryptonative companies and and\nprotocols potentially, like, what you know,\nfiguring out what that could potentially\nlook like. So I would say as I think\nabout, um, kind of institutions coming in\nthe space in the space or or kind of\nnon-crypto native companies, I think M&amp;A,\nthat's it, is happening. I think it'll\ncontinue to happening at a faster clip.\nRight? If you think about the cycle of\nany sort of M&amp;A deal, it's long. You're\nthree months is best case scenario. Six\nmonths is probably average for a deal\ncycle there. And then, you know, probably\nsome of them last, you know, 12 months\nmore. So, like, there's, I thought this\nsix months ago, but there's, there's a\nlag. So, I think you'll even start\nseeing more, more kind of landing as time\ngoes on. Um, and then the other thing is\nkind of back to what I've been saying is\nuh, liquidity is king, right? And um, I\nthink that what institutions offer is\njust more liquidity than we can ever\nimagine. Our, our crypto or DeFi native\nminds, um, and so these protocols become\nmore efficient typically with more\nliquidity. um, offering something like\nBidd's collateral to mint a stable coin.\nThat's big, right? Because Bidd is an\nasset could grow to billions if not\ntrillions. I mean, we're talking an an\nasset manager that has 13.1 trillion\nunder management. It's not too crazy to\nthink of that, right? Um, so I think\nthose are kind of the two, two buckets.\nM&amp;A, we'll definitely see more of it. We\nalready have, so it's not that hard to\ntake. And then just more of these assets\nin DeFi. I'm starting to see it week\nover week, day over day, actually\nhelping some of the institutions figure\nout how that these assets can be\nutilized, um, within, within these\nprotocols.\nYeah, M&amp;A has definitely been\nquite a big trend. What do you think\nabout um, IPOs? Like, obviously Circle has\ncaused quite a big splash, and now I\nthink we're going to see a lot of demand\nfor other companies to to IPO.\nAbsolutely. I, I think here's one thing\nuh, crypto companies do a really good job\nof, and it's, it's chase narratives. So,\nlet's just move, remove fundamentals for\na second, right? Um, or the reasons why I\nthink, well, not all the reasons, but one\nof the core ones, I think, is just that I,\nany sort of crypto company IPOing, Circle\nkind of kicked off this, like, beautiful\nwindow of success or likely success. So,\nif you're thinking about, like, hey,\nwhat's a sort of net new, how can I get\nsome capital w within the company? Like,\nsome sort of, like, net new motion to kind\nof, um, I don't know, get, get renewed\neyeballs, get more capital, etc. An IPO\nis probably a good, a good move. Um,\nespecially given Circle's, you know, just\ndid that. And then also IPOs on chain. I\nthink a lot of people are talking about,\num, some, some, maybe some companies, like,\ncryptonative companies that may be too\nsmall to uh, actually IPO on a, a\ntraditional market could be pretty\ninteresting for them to just IPO, IPO\nonchain. Um, you know, it could be uh,\ncould be media companies doing stuff\nlike this. You could see that. Um, I, I\nthink it will be in particular for me. I\nthink that that that is, like, an\ninteresting uh, company segment is, like,\nthe ones that can't maybe can't launch a\ntoken because they don't have utility\nfor the token within a protocol. They\ndon't have a protocol potentially, but\nthey're definitely cryptonative. Um, and\nI think, like, these, you know, media\nagencies are are particularly in uh,\ninteresting there. I think uh,\ntokenization platforms could be very\ninteresting for that. Um, so I, I think\nwe'll see some, like, onchain native\nIPOs, meaning, like, they don't, they, they\ndon't, you know, IPO like Circle did, but\nI also think we'll see more companies try\nto go the Coinbase, Circle route, um, as\nwell.\nYeah. Can you explain more what you mean\nby an onchain IPO? Like, is this like\nissuing, like, security tokens?\nExactly.\nExactly. Just doing that. Issuing\nsecurity tokens onchain. Um, because if\nyou think about maybe the IPO process in\nthe traditional sense, it's probably the\nlike walled garden to making that happen\nis, is probably a little too high for\nsome of these, like, smaller, small cap\ncompanies. But maybe the process of\nlaunching something onchain or ipoing\nonchain, um, you know, via some sort of\nlike tokenizing the the securities, I\nthink could be an interesting approach\nand open up, like, a window where these\ncompanies that couldn't IPO through this\nnormal route can now, um, maybe we change\nthe acronym, right? It's not, maybe it's\nnot IPO on chain, but, um, yeah, I think, I\nthink that could be a, an interesting\nroute.\nYeah, it's definitely, definitely curious\nidea. Um, how's the Wormhole, um,\ngovernance\num, setup been going?\nYeah. Um, Wormhole\ntook an interesting approach to\ngovernance. So, we launched our token a\nlittle over a year now, and we actually\nnet new built, uh, we, we built a net new\ngovernance protocol. Um, and the idea\nwas, we talked to a lot of uh, governance\nprotocols, like Tally. Um, I think\nthey're, they're, like, one of the biggest\nones on Ethereum. I think they run most\nprotocol governance. One of the biggest\nissues they had was, as multi-chain\nbecomes more of a a thing, right? So,\nyou have a native token, let's say, for\na protocol on Arbitrum, and people send\nit to all these different chains. Uh,\nyou actually can't use it in governance\nwhen the token exists on that chain. Um,\nand so governance participation in\ncrypto. I think governance in general is\nthis area of crypto that needs a a lot\nof work. Um, but one of the core\nproblems is, like, as you send these\ntokens to different chains, you can't\nuse them in governance. So, like, we're\nalready struggling with kind of\ngovernance being effective on chain. Um,\nand then you add this additional\nfriction layer as multi-chain becomes\nmore and more of a thing. Tokens go\neverywhere. You know how\nit introduces more friction. So we said,\nhey, what if we built something because\nW, our native token is exists on all on\nall these different chains. Um, so what\nif we built something where you could\nvote from any chain? And so we built\nmultiggov with Tally, where effectively\nyou can send your token to whatever\nchain, have it on there, use it in D5,\netc. Uh, and you could still vote with\nit on that chain. And this is all done\nin the either the w.wormhole.com\n\n\nOr the tally.xyz Wormhole like governance tab. Um, so it took us a while, candidly, Tim, to launch governance, and that's because we rebuilt a lot of those core primitives, and we also rebuilt a lot of the governance stuff on Solana. It was a little bit clunky. It wasn't what we needed, and so we spent a lot of time rebuilding some of the core primitives for governance on Solana. Um, so you could vote from EVM chains and Solana with multichain. So we rolled that out finally, uh, I think a few months ago. We're on our third proposal now. The proposal is kind of getting grants together. But here's the thing is, um, maybe not to be too long-winded, but I have this thing about like crypto's going through its practical era. I think one of the, we're asking ourselves a few questions, right? One question is, how many validators do you really need to secure a network? Um, do you need to have thousands of permissionless validators across all these different geos? Can you have, you know, a hundred? Can you have 13 like Hyperlquid? I actually don't know Hyperlquid's latest number, so don't quote me on it, but I know it's not a lot, right? We, we used, we came from this world of like, you know, tribally arguing this, right? Like saying Solana was centralized. You look at Solana and they have thousands of validators, and now we have protocols that are just like the darlings of crypto with 13. So I think that's one thing we're asking ourselves. And then the second thing I think we're asking ourselves is how is governance the best thing for these protocols? And I absolutely think you need governance. That's not what I'm saying. But I think like how decentralized is the question. I think a good example is, um, is Jupiter recently, right? Jupiter has been coming under a little bit of fire because they put stuff like who they're hiring, those decisions, uh, through the governance process. And look, but I don't know exactly all the details. There's a lot to follow in crypto, but I do know that they were catching a lot of fire for that, right? It, it was slowing them down. The leaders were having to focus and argue with people in the forums, right? And so I think for when we think about Wormhole's governance, one thing that is really important for me is I want to be thoughtful, making sure that it's decentralized, um, just like our protocol is decentralized, but I don't want to slow down, you know, the development of the protocol. It's a competitive space, uh, interoperability, and we need to be in a position where we can move fast, uh, and make decisions effectively in order to maintain our edge on the market.\n\nSo you don't think you'll ever be fully decentralized?\n\nNo, no, no. I'm not saying that at all. I think again, decentralization is a spectrum, unfortunately. Like, you, I was in DC, uh, recently and talking about like this exact thing, decentralization, and I think, I think some of the like leading discussions are, are actually trying to answer like, what is decentralized? I think so, maybe some traditional definitions, you know, I'm going to botch this, but are loosely around like, no one controls over 20% of a like given decision or something like that, right? So you could translate that into cryptonative speak to something like a five-party multi-sig is probably not okay, or at the min, at the bare minimum of okay, right? You have five people, uh, you know, that's maybe like each have 20% or something like that, right? Um, so, so I think, I think what, what I'm saying is I want to figure out what is sufficiently decentralized, but not so much so that we have a DAO that is lost in a quagmire of decision-making, um, and doesn't act slowly, loses their edge on the market, right? Um, that's what I'm, I'm worried about. So, I think we'll be decentralized. I think we will be sufficiently decentralized. I don't know, you know, what exactly that will look like in the future, but if you go on today, we have a delegate system similar to Arbitrum, um, all these other blockchains. So like, we are well on our way in terms of decentralization and decision-making. I think I'm just kind of being actively cautious about what sort of decisions go to the DAO because, uh, I've seen it time and time again, slow things down, and I've even seen token holders want this, right? Token holders in a project want there to be some sort of autonomy, uh, with the core people who are focused on it 24/7, uh, wants them to have some sort of autonomy with decision-making to move faster, more efficiently. And again, I encourage folks to go to the Jupiter DAO. I don't think Jupiter by did anything wrong, by the way. I think they just had some learnings along the way with how much they decentralized and the decisions they probably pushed to token holders.\n\nDo you think with the sort of changing regulatory environment in the US, projects are less worried about the need to be or appear decentralized and that it's now sort of a bit less of a focus?\n\nI think that it's definitely given projects the opportunity to take a breath and think about what is best there. We kind of went from this era of sprinting to decentralization at all costs because people were literally scared. So you wanted to be able to sprint at the at the expense of, again, like you really have to think about the trade-offs, like if you have, you know, you have to wait two weeks to make a decision versus making it in a day with a group of stakeholders who think about this all the time, like that's a significant business trade-off, and that's what effectively happens within decentralized governance. Um, and so I, I think that it's given a lot of projects the opportunity to like at least take a beat and not, not their decision-making process isn't decentralization at all costs because if not, I will, you know, I'm could get in some sort of trouble, right? I could be the centralized party controlling things. It's gone, it's gone from that maybe to like decentralization is important. It's a core primitive to crypto, and we want, we want the protocol to be decentralized. We want governance to be centralized, but we also want to win, and we want this protocol to be successful. And so maybe taking a little bit more time to understand what could be a more of a thoughtful governance process versus like, again, I, I really think we came from an era of just like sprinting to max centralization and then like having to pick up the pieces along the way. And I think we're even starting to see this kind of more thoughtful approach to, you know, all everyone, it's what's interesting, what I found, especially as going through this process myself, everyone in all the token holders, all people in crypto, the main thing they want from tokens is value accrual, but value accrual to flow back to the token, that is still something that is largely gated today, right? There's really not that many examples on chain of projects that are doing it. Um, a lot of them will do buybacks and burns because that will kind of bring value to the protocol. I've reviewed a lot of these, and it doesn't really help the token price that much. Um, and so a lot of them want buyback and then stream of revenue to these tokens. And so that's something that I think, uh, the regulatory shift could hopefully bring, um, for token holders because I think it's this like weird thing where projects token holders are asking for it, projects know it, but they're way too scared still to do that. Um, because they don't want their token to be a security. They don't want to pay this dividend, etc. Um, and so that's something that I'm hoping we, we definitely don't have regulatory clarity on right now. That's something I'm hoping we will soon. But that's, that's also when we think about like this shift, I think people are kind of positioning themselves to be ready for that. We're starting to see a lot of projects that start are getting revenue. Revenue is now kind of like a narrative. Um, you know, get, hey, we should get revenue, we should be, we should be revenue-generating companies, and then, and then they're positioning themselves to like bring the revenue in, hold, uh, and some sort of treasury, and then as soon as there's this clarity, I think we will really start to see flow to the tokens, and then the, the you'll see a separation in protocols even more. You'll see the ones that are actually making money and that money is flowing to tokens and not, but right now we're at this weird period where everyone's trying to figure out hacks like buybacks and burns, yeah, that's great, but it's definitely just a narrative pump still. It's not long-term value accrual. And even the narrative pump is going away, I would argue. I've seen a lot of people announce these buyback and burns, and it's very short-lived, um, success. So, I'm hoping, I'm, I think to answer your question, Tim, I definitely think this regulatory change has given protocol builders a break to figure out governance, and it's been good, and, and I think we, it's been needed. But I think we, if we want to figure out that value accrual and that flow to token holders, I think we need a little bit, little bit more safety there.\n\nDo you think you could see Wormhole doing revenue share within the next 12 months?\n\nUh, we will be in the position to do it if it is, uh, okay to do that's what I can say, absolutely. Um, so Wormhole today has multiple ways in which it can, uh, you know, value can be accrued, you could say, um, and we will have that value flowing to an onchain treasury, and then as soon as we have clarity on what can be done, we, we, of course, token holders are the number one, um, focus for us, uh, so absolutely, and, and especially token holders that participate in the governance process. Um, so yeah.\n\nIs, is there quite a bit of pressure to do that, given the sort of historical price, uh, performance?\n\nUm, more, I, I think there's a lot of pressure in general to just, um, have like a longer-term, like to start showing revenue, right? I think, I think we're, again, I'll maybe I'll go back to this like broad brand of practical era, right? Maybe the third kind of prong here is that as this industry matures, there's going to be more expected of these protocols. Um, no longer, I think, well, in the very, I think in the next 12 months, it'll be much harder to like launch a token and and survive off of the token. You'll have to have a meaningful business model. You'll have to create, have revenue, um, and be able to kind of create this like flywheel, right? This, this important, um, this ecosystem within your protocol. And so I think beyond, you know, anything token related, um, or price related, I think it's just something that's the natural progression for a company going through this, the phase that Wormhole is at, the stage Wormhole is, and a lot of other protocols for that matter that have kind of been around, um, surviving a token, etc. Um, so yeah, I think it's kind of this part of this practical, practical era for crypto.\n\nCool. And where do you see Wormhole in the next, in, in sort of five years time?\n\nUh, connecting every asset, app, institution, AI agent, and user onchain. I mean, that, that's like when we think about crypto, everyone talks about the UX needs to be better, blah, blah, blah. Like interoperability side of me say blah, blah, blah, like people have been saying the UX, the UX, and it's just like these things get a little tiresome over time, but it, it's not that it's not true. Um, you know, it's definitely not, not great. But I think the interoperability is the bit, one of the biggest unlocks for this like UX thing. You, you, we're going to see frontends and applications definitely dominate. Um, and then Wormhole is the actual connectivity layer behind all that, right? So like, let's use Poly Market as an example. If Poly Market's on Polygon, but if I want to, let's say, you know, and I'm not saying this is live today, but like, let's say I want have USDT from Tron. Um, but I just connect a wallet. It doesn't matter that I have USDT from Tron. I spend, I place a prediction for 100 USDT. But, but, uh, Poly Market says, \"Hey, we're on Polygon and we only accept 100 US or USDC on Polygon.\" Wormhole is the settlement for that for those stablecoins. So all that can happen seamlessly. Today, if you wanted to place a prediction on Poly Market, which I'm, I'm using an example because it's obviously one of the leading applications for crypto, uh, you would literally have to bridge over, uh, you know, your USDC from a certain chain to Polygon, uh, into Poly and swap it into Polygon USDC, and then you place your bet. It's, it's an awful, it would be an awful process, right? I think they've done a lot to to make that better by the way. Um, but like the concept I'm, I'm showing is just like any asset, doesn't matter the wallet, um, you know, and and and making sure all this is kind of connected in the background to provide a unified experience. It's like we are supporters of a Jupiter, supporters of a, of a, um, a Poly Market, etc. Um, so it's just a more assets, more institutions, more, more users, more apps, all of this. We're the connectivity layer, making, making everything seem like one chain is the best way to put it.\n\nAll right, it's quite the vision. Um, that is all we have for today.
