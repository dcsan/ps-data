  "cleanText": "Larry is back and with a new bet on infrastructure. He's got this message though. If your company isn't using AI, don't even bother pitching him. The global economy is shifting and he's moving capital accordingly. I'm Lawrence Lewin, managing editor for North America at the block. And our conversation starts now.\n\nYou know him from Shark Tank, but Kevin O'Leary has spent the last few years deploying serious capital across digital assets, infrastructure, and institutional computing. He was an early investor in Wonderfi, the Canadian crypto platform that quietly lit and quite literally took on his name. It consolidated much of Canada's regulated crypto sector and was just acquired by Robin Hood in a deal worth 250 million Canadian dollars or roughly $179 million in American exchange rate is not that bad just yet in an all-cash deal. So now he's backing BitZero, a clean energy data center that powers Bitcoin mining, AI, and high performance computing. And all of this is happening as the US imposes sweeping new tariffs on Canadian goods. And former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney is three months in as Prime Minister. Kevin's here to talk strategy, macro pressure, and why infrastructure is the next frontier in crypto. Kevin, welcome. Great to have you. Great to talk to you again.\n\nThank you. Great to be here.\n\nThank you for being here. And so, uh, let's kind of start with the the big macro story that's happening in North America. That's what's making headlines this week. President Trump hitting Canadian imports with a sweeping 35% tariff. It's the kind of policy that doesn't just impact goods. It hits capital, infrastructure, and strategic investment decisions. Kevin, you've got deep ties on both sides of the border. What's your reaction to this move? Well, the market has figured out Trump's strategy is um bombastic to say the least, but that just when he throws a 35% tariff on Tokyo or Japan, I mean, or the EU or Canada or Mexico, it's it's it's part of a negotiating strategy. And the market has decided that probably where we're going to for the majority of this is a 10% reciprocal tariff. And how long that's going to take. Most people think that will happen before the midterms come into play. So, kind of year end. So, where do I think Canada's going specifically with Carney? Well, you may recall um in November Daniel Smith when you think about all of the all of the goods and services that you know Trump talks about in terms of trade with Canada, the majority of it is energy. And so if you took out energy specifically from Alberta, there is no trade deficit with Canada. In fact, Canada buys more from America and vice versa with the exception of energy. It's multi-billion. She was smart enough to go to Mara Lago when Trump was just talking about tariffs maybe before he was the inauguration and sit down with him there off the record. And lo and behold, she's the only province with a 10% tariff on her major output, which is energy. Everybody else has got this 35% thing for our American for our American friends that you're talking about the premier of Alberta. But I mean it's a good case study of when you ask me of you know what's going to happen and why the why is the market at an all-time high because it's already discounted a 10% reciprocal tariff with the rest of the world. That's kind of what it's thinking. Could be wrong. But right now, that's why these announcements that come on a Monday morning all the time when he gets back from wherever he was on the weekend don't really affect the indices that much anymore with the exception of China, which I think is a separate conversation. That is not a typical tariff deal. That is an economic war between the two largest economies on everything from AI to Tik Tok to social media to uh the theft of IP and lots more. But the market's getting used to volatility is what I'm trying to say in a long- winded answer.\n\nWell, yet so, but looking at at it in that way, is Trump just posturing or or do you think this is truly a a structural shift? you know, you say that it's kind of he's taking on a big 35% number there with US's largest trading partner and as you said this is uh much of that the trade happens because of energy and if you take out energy it's actually maybe something that could potentially hurt the US. So, do you think that this is a just but do you think that this has changed America's long-term uh position or is it uh is it just Trump making a lot of noise?\n\nWell, those of us that are investors in real estate, and that's my largest holding in in in my portfolio investments know Trump as a developer and this is how he negotiated and I would argue quite successfully over the last 40 years. And so when he hits a painoint, you know, going back to why all of a sudden Canada um remember just 10 days ago they were about to impose a digital tax on American social media content. He basically said if you do that all negotiations are off and of course that was changed. Carney changed that because that was proposed back in as far back as 2019, never implemented and for good reason. It was bad policy then, it's bad policy now and he decided to take that off the table probably wisely. I think Carney will negotiate a 10% reciprocal across the board with Trump. That's where we're going on that. What it does change and remember you don't make money off politics, you make money off polit. And so you try and ignore all the noise which is what I do and say what is the outcome of this? Can the US economy continue to grow at a 10% reciprocal tariff? Is that too heavy a burden? And my answer would be no. Because you already know countries in Europe and in the G20 impose what's called a value added tax which can be between 7 and 14%. And their economies are successful and we pay those VAT taxes in many cases when we buy or shop or buy, you know, get goods or services from them. So, think of the 10% tariff in the US as the US putting on a VAT tax, a value added user tax, a consumption tax. Now, nobody could pass that in Congress, but Trump kind of called it something else. And now he calls it a tariff. And everybody's saying, \"Oh, tariff. Okay, a tariff. It's that. That's all it is.\" And you know, for me, I think we we can live with that. And I think the markets have figured that out, too. And but but I really think in terms if you want to think timing of it, you'll get this thing resolved pretty well by year end because he does not want to risk his majority on this issue into the midterms.\n\nAnd do you see so with that in mind, how are you structuring your your your investments now? How do you allocate capital between the US and Canada? What what side of the border are you playing?\n\nWell, I I didn't invest at all in Canada during the period of the economic coma under the idiot king Trudeau. Um, and that's because no one else did either. We all quietly left. I mean, he put in place a bill called C69, which got nicknamed the anti-pipeline bill, but it was anti- any development. You could not develop anything. And you got to remember, the country created all of its wealth uh from resources. So, there were no mine permits granted. There was no pipelines, no gas, no LNG, nothing. Um, the idiot king had some vision that nobody ever understood. And he basically took the Canadian population that was around 9 10% at the poverty line to 25% impoverished. And he did. It took him 10 years and then they finally threw him out. I mean, they just said, \"Sorry, idiot king and we're all starving here. What the hell are you doing?\" And they threw him out. And so, um, one of the challenges Carney has is he's kind of got a little bit of that stink on his suit because he was advising the Idiot King for the last four or five years. And he also has some idiot king advisers like Freeland, which was, you know, deputy prime minister. She was the finance minister. She took the country to its knees. It was a disaster. And the I mean, Paul, it was bad policy. I'm sure he's not a bad guy, but he had no idea what he was doing. And so now, um, you have to look at Canada. It's it's in the toilet bowl. It's it's the it's a disaster. But from from the wastage, the carnage, are there opportunities? I mean, that's really what you do as an investor. And so I listened to Carney. I didn't vote for him, but I want him to be successful. And he's saying the right things. And he's telling people like me, bring money back. And I'm saying, well, how can we trust you? I mean, you your policy screwed us to the ground. I mean, you just killed us. And how do So, but I'm listening and I'm thinking to myself, what's the biggest opportunity Canada has right now? It's data centers because they have the lowest cost of power in the world with stranded natural gas. And so, that's what I'm focusing on. and I went to see Danielle Smith and said, \"Look, you you have unlimited stranded natural gas. I would like to build the world's largest data center here. Is that possible?\" And that's what we've been working on because I've already experienced it in Norway and in Finland on bit zero, which I know we'll talk about. But the reason those those places worked is the price of the power was under 6 cents a kilowatt hour. And here we have a situation where it could be lower than 4/10 a kilowatt hour in in Alberta. So yes, I think Canada has a lot of opportunity and I'm I've proposed a development there across 13,000 acres um near Grand Prairie, Alberta. My team is there today. We just got off discussing it and it's third it it will be over 7 gigawatts. I mean you find me anywhere in North America with a bigger opportunity than that. And so, yes, I'm telling people, let's go back and revisit Canada under the new regime. Uh, the idiot king is gone, and this guy sounds like he knows what he's doing. Let's talk to him.\n\nWell, uh, to full disclosure on your part, you you were considered a potential candidate years ago to lead the Conservative Party. Um, I I think it was an issue of of language, of course. Uh, my Egyptian mothers yelled at me in French. Uh, I I know I know you you had a Lebanese mom. I don't I she maybe should have yelled at you a little more in French like my mom did. Um, maybe the history of Canada would have been a little different. I don't know. But we can't visit that again. But nonetheless, what is your view on uh what's happening in the Conservative Party uh with Pierre Paleva basically floundering uh after almost having it in his hand.\n\nWell, there's here's some stats. you can look at the past to educate yourself about the history because you're right I'm pretty steeped in the parliamentary system even in England and in Australia as well and the rules are pretty clear and so in the case of let's talk about caring first he did not win a majority mandate um he was he was a few seats shy now unfortunately the history of the Canadian parliamentary system if you don't win a majority mandate right out of the gate your average shelf life is 18 months before another election and then after that um that you you have to try and win a majority mandate because you really can't get too much stuff done with a minority. Uh in Canada, you need a majority mandate. So, it's highly likely within 18 months he'll have another um uh election and if if the Canadian people like him enough, they'll give him a majority mandate and then he can do what he needs to do. However, um it the history books aren't good. Now, let's go to the conservative side in the side of the Conservative party. Even though Pier did a pretty good job getting a lot of seats in Ontario, which is very important economy, unfortunately, when you miss on an open net, to use a hockey analogy, in the Conservative party, um you're toast. And so, you'll find that out in August when he has he didn't even win his own seat. And so, that's not good. He's not really officially the opposition leader till he gets back um you know, into parliament. And so unfortunately uh anything could happen but the history books are very unkind to missing an open net. Every single one of them that missed an open net is history. And so you know that's the way it is. It's a cruel business. Parliamentary politics is nasty. I experienced it myself. I was winning by 3% or 2.3% until I hit Quebec and I got slaughtered. So I know how that works and I do respect anybody that goes through that process. It's incredibly hard, but I wish Carney the best. And he has 18 months to deliver and after that probably history.\n\nAnd if if he doesn't deliver in those 18 months, is that something you're interested in?\n\nNo. No. I'm so busy. I'd rather be a lead uh on Canadian investment, try and get the world back after the king is gone. And I think that that would be a good job for me. I can't imagine going through that meat grinder again. And you know, and I'm I'm not sure the Canadian people want me to do that. they'd rather see me bring billions of dollars back to the country.\n\nSo along those lines, uh, and and you mentioned a bit about infrastructure here, but but how do you see the the change as you mentioned? Uh, just kind of flesh it out a little bit more. How do you see things changing now that Trudeau is back to in Montreal or wherever, I don't know, where wherever he's going. Um, enjoying the single life, I guess. Uh what allegedly maybe not. Um the the uh the question of course is how do you invest in infrastructure under a Mark Carney? You you talked a little bit about Alberta. Anything else going on?\n\nYou know, it's he did not repeal C69, their forementioned um policy that stopped any money coming into Canada. Even the Canadian pension plans didn't invest in Canada during the reign of the idiot king. And so that was incredible. they they went elsewhere. And so he has to change that. And what he signals is he's saying every province, which I thought was a great idea. Bring out your best ideas to get us out of this economic rut and I'll improve them individually by projects. I'll I'll accelerate. I'll green light them. I'll get them through the permitting process, you know, in a very short period of time, which it which is required to get\n\n\nCapital. I mean, if you told me I had to wait 10 years to get a permit, I wouldn't bother going to Canada. There's opportunities elsewhere. And that's exactly what happened. So he's saying even though he's leaving the policy in place, it gives him personal control project by project. But unfortunately or fortunately for him, the only one that's material in terms of really a large amount of revenue in a short period of time is pipelines for oil and gas out of Alberta. That's where you could make billions of dollars in a very short period of time to rebalance the Canadian economy. And so he's going to have to look at a lot of soul-searching there because he's also known, and this is where the mistrust may come from, as a guy that brought this green group together in Glasgow when he was around the Bank of England. They've all quit. Every country that got involved that has quit because it wasn't practical. It didn't work. So that fell apart. If he still has a mandate to decarbonize the Canadian economy, he'll fail. And he probably knows that because the Canadian people will continue to go into poverty. So that's he's got this 18 months to prove that he's not like that, that he cares about the Canadian people and that he greens lights some projects, but the one that makes all the money is oil and gas. And so, um, you know, whether it was Bergam or Daniel Smith, the premier of Alberta, that got them the lower tariff rate was to set up for this. But he's on a pressure cooker. He really, really is. And I'm saying I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt because I mean I would love to invest in Canada because it's it's it couldn't be any worse there. I mean this is the when there's when there's blood in the economic streets is when you want to invest and everybody hates Canada right now. This is the time to get in.\n\nWell, you mentioned just briefly right before that he was also the head of the Bank of England. This is the first time we've ever had a prime minister who was head of not one but two G7 countries central banks. He understands in many ways, you know, you might not agree with his policies and and what have you on as a central banker, but nonetheless, he at least has some insight into what some of the largest economies and how they run. Do you think that that's going to help long term Canada's innovation edge and also particularly, let's focus obviously because of our audience, let's focus a little bit on digital assets and and and there do you think that having Mark Carney helps or hurts the future of Canada and digital assets?\n\nWell, let's, I mean, you're making a great point here. I mean, to put it more bluntly, Mark Carney is not an idiot king. He's a very intelligent man. You may agree or not agree on his policies. And he's very accomplished with executional skills. And this is something the previous administration had none of. And so it's sort of in in that we trust and we see where it goes. But the problem is everything he does now is extremely measurable because you'll either see it in the value of the Canadian dollar or you'll see it in the value of capital coming back into the country through infrastructure spending or and and digital. This is a really interesting thing you brought up here because I I have been almost to every state in North America and every province. I have looked at projects as I did. In fact, that project in Norway started in upstate New York when the policy went wonky. So, we moved the facility to Norway where we could get stable policy and then we discovered how good Norway was and we we went into Finland. So, I've been doing the same thing. I have gone to states like Oklahoma, Virginia, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and and working with the governors there saying where can we build because you can't have a digital economy without a data center, AI, defense, crypto, it all stems from the infrastructure of data centers. So I like to be in the infrastructure side. I like the picks and shovels. Yes, I own crypto. Yes, I own, you know, stable coins. Yes, I own the company that makes the stable coins. But I want the the the infrastructure and that's where, you know, I could take my abilities or at least my history in real estate and apply it to the complexity of building data centers. And that's where the biggest opportunity is for Canada. They have the lowest cost power with hydro and gas in the world. And so if they want to diversify their economy, and Carney's no idiot on this, he's got to find a way to attract guys like me to come in because these the minimum the minimum in Alberta to put to work now just to get the first gigawatt set up is 5 to 6 billion.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd then a total expansion up to 70 billion. I mean, that is huge money. It's it's huge. And there's no way you're going to attract that with the policy that that Canada lost on the C69, all the rest of that stuff. So, he's got to change all that. But what in the job creation and just the onset of of being part of the digital age and AI development, Canada could lead in that. But we'll wait and see what happens.\n\nIt's very exciting. I could certainly hear that message from Daniel Smith in my ear. I don't hear it from Carney yet, but I'm an optimist. Uh, one of the other provinces, Quebec, um, has a lot of the hydro. It shares it with New York. That's kind of part of why New York had all those infrastructure plays to begin with, why it had all that Bitcoin mining. It was the dams over in Msina, the Robert Moses Dan, giving very cheap power. New York rejected it. They said, you know what, we don't want this Bitcoin mining stuff. Uh, it hurts our socialist base. Let's throw it out. And and They took it over to Norway, you said, to the Nordic countries, but not to Quebec.\n\nNo, I don't think you can attract capital of Quebec right now. Um, just on the permitting aspect, I think there's a complete mistrust over the last decade. Um, and I I don't mean to disparage them. I was born there. I mean, I'm a native. I was I was born in Montreal. I love Quebec. I love Montreal. But um I I don't think it's a place you can do business. They they would have to change a lot. They'd have to basically I don't know what they'd have to do because I don't think you can get a permit. I don't think you can build a data center there. I don't think you'd die of old age before you got a permit. And so I mean I I you know if that changes I'll be the first they should call me. That's what they should do. I mean because I I have I have I have Carl Agran, the granddaddy of all grand, he was the first guy to build. He was a civil engineer for the army and and he now lives in Dubai. He's on my team and everybody respects him in data center development. Um we we we haven't even looked at Quebec. We wouldn't I mean they'd have to show us they'd have to show us a road map on how because it it's too much risk when you're talking about you know five two and a half billion in equity, two and a half billion in debt with a with a government that has never issued a permit for anything in over 10 years.\n\nHow's that going to work? It's not going to work.\n\nSo, LGO nonetheless has been has often positioned himself as business friendly. Uh having been a business...\n\nReally give me an example of that.\n\nWell, okay. I I I'm saying he he tries to he tries to have that image at least.\n\nWell, if you know him, tell him to call me. Maybe I could help him.\n\nI was just going to ask if you've ever spoken to him about...\n\nNo. No, I haven't. I mean, I listen, I wish him the best. I I want my home province to win some stuff. We're talking about data centers now. I don't think there's anything on the books there. I I know every data center project on Earth. I don't think anything over a gig, not a chance in hell it's going there unless he does some massive change on policy. And if he did, he he would get a lot of interest. So, it's up to him. It's it's it's his feet. If he can deliver power and policy and fiber and put it in a place where there's at least 2,000 acres, they'll be lining up at his door. Maybe he'll figure that out. Well, LGO, you heard that. You heard it right here. Uh, give Kevin a call. It's a local call from Quebec City, I think. Uh, you should be fine. Uh, let's talk a little bit about why you're here, though, because it it's definitely an infrastructure play. It's Bit Zero. It's your latest investment. It's focused on clean energy data centers, uh, powering everything from Bitcoin mining to AI compute. Uh, this is a different kind of infrastructure play than you normally find. Why now? What makes this space investable in today's climate?\n\nYou know, there's an insatiable demand for um clean data centers worldwide. Over 225 gigs of demand. Uh the US alone or North America, 45 gigs. Only five are under construction. Insatiable demand. I allocate capital. Um capital I raise my own capital and my own funds, whatever. They're all telling me they want to take a position on this, you know, three to 5% waiting in a typical multi-billion dollar sovereign fund. I'm you know that's what I do for a living. I do allocations. I do indexing. So they're telling me okay where can we deploy debt and equity into this space? And um I say my policy is always you you own the asset. This is this is akin to hundreds of years ago in the gold rush. Yes, you want to own the gold, but you would have made more money just selling the jeans, the shovels or the shovels and the picks, you know, and and the equipment for building the mines themselves. That's better in terms of diversifying your risk. So, I I tell everybody, why not do both, which is what I'm doing. Buy the infrastructure of the actual data center because you're gonna that that's where all crypto comes from and lives. Whether it's Bitcoin mining or supporting Ethereum or stable coins or whatever, own that then own the companies that issue the digital product. That would be a Coinbase and a Circle. I own them. A Robin Hood, I own them. I own Wonderfy. Robin Hood bought it. I mean, it it that that was my whole thesis. Own the infrastructure and you'll participate in the growth of this sector. So it's a two-pronged approach. Owning own the asset, own the bitcoin or whatever crypto your you know blend is. I have a Har is another big position for me for me. I think that's a very important product in the market. You know it it has a great use case for infrastructure and logistics management. So I own that. I mean I it's sort of all of these things fit together and I'm just saying this is how I'm doing it. You don't have to do it my way, but it's worked for me and I I tend to do things that work for me and and that and I have a longer term in view. I put investments in the ground to sort of five to seven years and um they they prove to be often very very successful and they pay for all the mistakes I make because I I make mistakes too. But you know, it's sort of like um it it's you go where the puck is going. Again using the hockey analogy and the puck is going to data centers everywhere. The returns on data centers now are double digits and and but you getting them done is complicated. So the how do you see bit zero particularly is it is it an AI is it more of an AI infrastructure play or is it more of a crypto infrastructure play? Is it both or how would you allocate the kind of play it is?\n\nIt's a power play. It's a it's a beautiful thing because it's figured out and I love the management there and I've increased my holdings there. Um they understand everything starts with power. You can't do anything in crypto, anything in Bitcoin, anything in stable coins, anything in anything without power. So they try and find where is the power, the cleanest power at the lowest cost I can get. Then where is the land? Where can I buy or lease land beside the power? Then they say where is the fiber? How do I connect this data center to the world? Can I get fiber there? You get the power, you get the land, you get the fiber. Then you need the people. Do I have an educated workforce near this town, near this place in Norway or Finland? If the answer to that is all yes, that's where bit zero goes. And because they've had success and they understand how the politics and the and the policies work there, they have been successful. And so, and you know, obviously with Bitcoin, they're mining Bitcoin now, you know, on the Norway site at 120,000 this morning. Uh they're very profitable. And so, you know, they understand how that works. And so I back management that does that. And so that's one of my infrastructure plays. It's far more advanced than I'm at in Alberta right now. But that's part of what I'm thinking. I saw it worked for me when we moved it out of New York. We moved it to Norway. That was over 5 years ago. And now I've see the opportunity in Alberta and I'm looking at one in West Virginia right now. All the same.\n\nThey're all the same.\n\nThe West Virginia one is primarily coal.\n\nNope. It's gas.\n\nWow. And so this is going to be uh in many ways this is we we talk about ESG, of course it's become a dirty word uh particularly over the past few months in to some extent but nonetheless uh how do you see a way to profit off of ESG investing?\n\nYou know I I don't think you need to to talk about it in the context of ESG. The fact is the tenants. There's 15 tenants of data centers. The Microsofts, the Google's, XAI, Soft Bank, and all of us involved in there's there's probably only 12 viable groups developing giga centers. I'm one of them. There's others. We talk to these tenants all the time and they tell us what they want and they want cleaner power. And so right now that but but they want it today. I mean, I love I love the ideas of small nukes, but they're not going to be around for 14\n\n\nYears. So, the cleanest power I can find right now is stranded net gas with carbon sequestration.\n\nAnd so, we have that. Um, and the thing you got to understand about this form of development is you're developing the specs with the tenant that they're telling you, \"Here's what I want.\" And then you're, you know, whether it's Gendler or Sudlo or, you know, we've got a huge team of engineers. I funded this whole thing myself so far, the soft cost on Alberta at least. And I'm learning a lot about what the tenants want. And I talked to them and they say, \"Look, Kevin, we we don't want 250 megawatts. We need a gig, but we got to be able to expand to two.\" And then lately, it's been, \"We got to be able to expand to three.\" And for the first time last week, I heard, \"I have to be able to expand to five.\" So you see how fast the market is moving, and so I have to move that fast. And so the people that can work with them beside them and bring the capital in the debt and the equity, um, and be able to understand, and a lot of this comes from the work that Paul Pangen and Carl Agran are doing that they they they head up my whole thing, um, in these data center developments. And Carl's a legend. Um, I mean, he's he's the guy, everybody respects him. He's one of the co-founders of A24. So it's sort of like, or you know, A42, I think it is. It's you know, the one of the founding, um, data center building companies. I I get mixed up with A24 because that A24 is a production company doing my movie with Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nI didn't realize you were doing a film with...\n\nI am. I'm an actor in a movie coming out on Christmas Day called Marty Supreme. I've been working on it for six months. I'm a really bad guy in 1952, but the richest guy in America in '52. Gwyneth is my wife and Timmy's a guy hustling me. Um, we had a lot of fun making it. We're still shooting it.\n\nThat's A24 as a production company. G42 is what Carl's working on. I got to get those numbers in my head right.\n\nIt's okay. As long as it they they pay, then they'll be fine.\n\nOh, I think you're going to love the movie.\n\nOh, we'll definitely look out for that one. The um, but how are you structuring your your your infrastructure deals? This is this is through um, this is through Bit Zero. How are you structuring it? Is it are you independent from them? How you have an investment in them? What's the what's the setup?\n\nWell, when you're dealing in different sovereign regions, you have different structures. I mean, Bit Zero is is not in Alberta right now. That's not the case. Alberta is in a Canadian province, so it has a complete separate company uh building that out. And Bit Zero is in Norway and Finland. And so that is a separate entity on its own. I'm just an investor in both. And so, you know, they're in my portfolio, but they're separate entities with separate management, separate investors, separate financial structure. It's diversification, but Bit Zero is far advanced to where Alberta Wonder Valley is right now. Wonder Valley, we haven't even broke ground yet. We're just in the beginning of the permitting process, and that's very important.\n\nWell, we there's another there's another wonder uh Wonderfy that was the Canadian crypto platform that eventually took your name. It was as I said before was acquired for 250 Canadian uh which is about what was it 170, 179 American roughly.\n\nI call it call it 180, but who's counting?\n\n180. Okay. So $180 million. Uh, you were a big investor. They changed their name to Wonderfy. Um, and so now what was your big takeaway from all this? And how are you holding, are you said you're holding beyond Bitcoin, HAR, and other things? How are you allocating or is there anything that you're allocating differently in this in this scenario?\n\nWell, my view has always been the majority of the population would rather uh have an account on an exchange that that's very transparent to them and regulated. And so, um, you know, Robin Hood's very interesting, and I have a Robin Hood account as well, but my investment thesis on Wonderfy, um, was a lot of people know that I'm I'm a crypto advocate and have for years, and I've been I lived through the crypto cowboy period with Binance and FTX, and I've been an advocate in Washington and worked on the Genius Act, which I hope get signed at the White House on Friday, with Hagerty and others. Um, and this is all important, but for me was the investment was why don't if I think I could find a management team as I did in Canada that can consolidate all the dependent exchanges into one behemoth. It would fit with with with either Coinbase or it would fit with Robin Hood or it would fit with somebody maybe a Canadian bank. But Vlad is such a visionary and I'm a big fan of his. Um, he's a very compelling guy. It made a lot of sense to me. uh his team was amazing, his his lead council, I mean they were all fantastic, but I'm just an investor in that. I had no role in management. I had no say in the deal that was negotiated with Dean. But in terms of where, you know, a good home and I was one investor that, you know, wanted to that cared. I mean, I spent a lot of time building up WonderFi as an investor and put a lot of capital at risk. And so, um, I was happy with the outcome of that. I think it's going to be a great outcome for Vlad and I think it'll be good uh for for Canada as well because it they'll become part of a global uh community and they'll compete that way and if Canada gets data centers that makes it even better. So it all kind of fits together but um it goes back to the point you want diversification in your portfolio. You don't know when you put money to work in a WonderFi 5 years ago what the outcome's going to be other than that the ocean is rising not sinking. Crypto is rising, compliance is rising, institutional interest is rising, Bitcoin is rising. It's all rising. And so where do you catch your piece of that? And you want to do it diversely.\n\nWell, I thought Wonder if I was a good and I was right on that one. So it's sort and I'll be wrong on something else, but you know I was it sort of you have to kind of find multiple places, diversify your opportunities, and that was one of them. Bit Zero, certainly I'm extremely excited about where that company's going, and I'm very excited about Alberta as I am Circle. Look at Circle, my...\n\nI was just going to I was just going to ask about Circle because you were you were very early in Circle. Uh, they've obviously gone public, very big IPO that that happened, one of the biggest IPOs of the year. Um, and you invested early on. Uh, and and of course for for the folks at home who might not know Circle, which I think is very few people who who watch the blocks uh uh view under don't know that it's uh behind USDC, which is the second biggest stable coin out there. This of course a different type of infrastructure play. Um, and as you mentioned, you're gonna have a you're gonna go to the White House on on Friday yourself to to do this.\n\nI I don't know. I don't know if I'm doing that yet. I don't know. I'm just hoping it happens. I mean, I It's a ceremonial signing, so I just hope it happens.\n\nWell, you know, both you and and the uh and the president were both CNBC stars at one point. So, um you could probably you could probably uh give...\n\nI I hope who's at his arm would be Senator Hagerty because he put the heavy lifting into that bill and he has a fantastic team and great staff. They they they've pushed that through. They are rock stars.\n\nWell, I was going to ask, let's look kind of about stable coins and what's happening here. How do you think this is going to change um with the signing of the stable act? Uh, what does it mean for things like yield products which you know much about Circle yield, um, and we see of of course interest rates have risen, although there there's some discussion of of cutting them in the next few months in the US. We see other other economies cutting, um, but they're much higher than they were when you first invested in Circle. So tell us a little bit about where you see things going here.\n\nWell, let's talk about Circle. Five years ago, whatever it was, five or six years ago when I met Jeremy. He's a Boston guy. I'm a Boston guy. We both have 617 cell numbers. Um, I listened to his pitch and I thought the chance that he could pull this off was practically zero. But he was so compelling and I mean so convincing, and I said, \"H, you know, h, how can you bet against this guy?\" I mean, even though the odds were so against him and everybody told him not a chance in hell could he pull this off because he was talking about digitizing the American dollar and everybody said not a chance in hell, and crypto was considered some rogue thing, you know, back then. And uh, but I don't know h, how else to put it. The kahunas on that guy. That guy is laser focused, and I I made a bet early on, and wow, has it... I mean, thank you, Jeremy, all of us that went in with you uh back then, even the doubters, uh, you have proven everybody wrong. And so I I think that investments up...\n\nI mean, I I I c... it's thousands of times. I mean, I just I don't I don't even know. I mean, it's it's I mean, that's I don't even remember what I invest it at, at what price? But it was it was probably around 10 bucks or something. And look at it, it's trading just under 200 now. I don't remember. But I mean, you know, I I think my point is when you get it right, you are rewarded, but it's really at the feet of his team. I I met those guys multiple times. I went to their conferences. They were like this, myopically focused, and nobody could tell them they weren't going to win. That's the kind of management you want to bet on. Even if it takes you six, seven years, you're rewarded. Now look at him. He's one of the queen guys and bees and kings and you know, whatever you want to call them in terms of telling the world how we're going to use stable coins to commoditize trans price transparency and reduce costs on currency trading. I mean, it's fantastic what he's doing. And so, you know, you price gold, you price uh any commodity, it's in US dollars, oil, gas, you name it. Now, you have a digital way of paying for it at a fraction of the cost of the wed of the Fed wire. So, even if I want to buy a watch in Switzerland, you I wear two watches. I got to buy a lot of watches. And I have to go through all this crap to send over, you know, whatever I'm going to pay in Swiss Franks. If the watch maker will take USDC, boom, one second at a fraction of the cost. So anyways, all that's coming. It's all great. I think what it signals though, the signing of this act is the opening of the door to institutional clients that will bolster everything in crypto. That includes all of these, you know, block. If you think about blockchain and the opportunity there and and ETH is moving obviously for reasons like that, Algorand or uh Algorand or or or even uh you know, H bar I talked about earlier, they're all going to be lifted by the tide if there's a use case. And you talked about Mark Cuban and and the discussions we used to have sitting around for the hours we were around in in on Shark Tank about crypto is my attitude was, \"Look, show me the use case. Show me in five years why this... I don't want to buy a shitcoin. I don't care about apes and monkeys and all this crap. I care about what's the the the enterprise use case for this product.\" And that's where we would have some debates. But he was right in terms of NFTs. But I think the better case um was what I did early on in stuff like HAR getting in. I you know I think I bought that for pennies. But it it's now being used by big enterprise for logistics management. So for me it's all the use case. You can convince me to invest if you can show me the use case. And then I have the risk of executional you know abilities.\n\nJamie at at Circle, the guy was already proven with executional skills and every team member he brought on was a proven winner. You need that in some of these um you know these platforms. You can't just be a rogue cowboy. You have to have proof that you can execute.\n\nHow do you think it's going to go? Uh, how do you think things are going to pan out in the stable coin space? We we have a shareholder, major shareholder in Tether in the uh Oval Office, not I'm sorry, in in the White House being uh the Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnik. Um, and but nonetheless, it's not as regulated or it doesn't have the same kind of regulation that USDC does. With the signing of this act, what do you think happens next? The next first of all, short term, let's say the next three to six months, but also next 18 months, which is, you know, is uh centuries from now in crypto.\n\nYeah, it's true. I know Howard, he's a pretty smart guy. I mean, and he knows what's in the bill. Um, I know the Tether guys, too. I mean, I know all these guys. I mean, it's sort of that's if you were involved in the early days of stable coins, either stable coin, Tether is a is a behemoth, too. I mean, between Tether and Circle, it's probably 92% of the entire world market of US-based stable coins. But if you read the act, and I have read the act, you know that um there's an audit provision in there for full transparency to make sure that the assets that back these stable coins don't have a duration in T bills longer than 92 days and other provisions as well. And so Tether's going to have to deal with that transparency and they will. I'm sure Circle already does. They're very very compliant. And and Jeremy Alard was always saying, \"I want to be regulated because that's the only way I'm going to get, you know, a global acceptance.\" And so, and the way stable coins are going to work um in the comp\n\n\nCompetition, well, there'll be other stable coins, but these are these when you're first and you're big, you get to keep that unless you if you don't have good execution skills. But, you know, if you think about if I'm in Turkey or in Venezuela or Argentina or anywhere where my currency is more volatile than 4% a year, I'm going to buy a stable coin even if it doesn't pay interest. And so because that's how I'm going to maintain my wealth, and so the demand on the US Treasury bill will go up as these stable coins continue to issue to countries like that. And so if you're in Turkey, you're probably not going to get paid any interest on your stable coin, but you'd rather have that than your own currency because it's so volatile and inflationary in some cases.\n\nIn the US, there's a competition because you can buy USDC and stick it into, uh, you know, a Coinbase account and make, you know, I don't know what it is today, probably 4.1%. Because the T-bills they own to back it are making 4.2% or whatever it is, whatever the spread is, but you see my point. That's where there's going to be a lot of competition. But I say, uh, may the best man win. That's how our the American economy works. You want competition. You want innovation. You don't want regulation once that's established. You want innovation to advance these companies. And certainly Tether has some very smart people too. And I think Jeremy knows that and he'll have to compete. Um, I think they're both very interesting situations.\n\nBut, have not to, for me, is how can I buy commodities like gold? I have a 5% waiting in gold, the asset class itself. Why wouldn't I want to own a stable coin that I can do price discovery with at a very low friction cost on any asset backed by the US dollar? I mean, just think about it. Of course you want USDC. I'm going to buy assets in different countries in USDC and they're going to accept it from me because it's a regulated, you know, financial product backed by the law of the land by the and the STC. That's what makes it globally accepted.\n\nSo, I think we're in a really interesting phase. I'm waiting for Friday and then we move on to the market infrastructure act, which will finally deem Bitcoin a commodity in my belief and open up more institutional interest. There's so much work to be done.\n\nSo that that seems fairly bullish about the US, but you're a citizen of another country, the UAE. Uh, I don't know how long have you been a citizen out there and also, how are you looking at your capital now, uh, with this change? You know, we've we talked considerably earlier about Canada, we're talking about US changes outside of US and North America. How are you looking at, for instance, the Middle East, the UAE particularly? Uh, how are you looking at their regulation and also tying it in as well to this infrastructure play, AI? How?\n\nJust for a full disclosure, here's my status with citizenships. I have a Canadian passport. I have an Irish passport. I have a golden visa, not a citizenship, okay, in the UAE, uh, which is very important because it allows me to become an investor at the ADGM in Abu Dhabi. And so, um, you know, and I I have set up entities there because one thing I learned over the last three years in the UAE, if you look at AI development and AI spending, number one is the US, number two is China, number three UAE. And so the and they are very, very, very advanced in agent development. The idea that, you know, I could develop an AI Kevin or an AI actor or an AI CEO.\n\nYou should see their technology. We, I just shot a commercial there for one development real estate company. I've never seen a studio like that. Completely AI compliant, massive digital walls. We didn't have to do post-production the same way because the AI linked the script directly to what was playing in the background being shot simultaneously. We saved hundreds of thousands of dollars of development cost. These guys are nailing it over there. And all of my AI stuff is most of it's originating there with my own team. And so that's a big investment philosophy for or, you know, focus for me is to is to work within the UAE on these, um, and they're very big in other asset classes. Watches, for example, watch week is coming up in November.\n\nUh, the Sadiki family. I mean, if you're if you're into watches worldwide, you know the family. They're like, they're huge in watches and just the direction of watches and all that stuff. And watch insurance is big for me. Wondercare is my watch insurance company. I'm going to launch it over in the UAE as well. Very much part of what we're doing with Sadiki. So, I I think all of this stuff fits together. You have to think globally. You have to think globally. You don't want to put all the eggs in one geography. They all fit together.\n\nTrump's visit to the UAE was about AI. Making sure that the Nvidia chip was the supreme chip, not the Huawei chip in a country that's spending so much on AI. You want to have Nvidia stack there. And so all the developers work within the sphere of friendship around American technology. And that was important for Saudi Arabia too. All of this fits together. So you have to you have to understand how this giant policy puzzle fits to put your capital in the right places at the right time.\n\nAre you using AI in your investment decision process at all, either either to actually give you insights into how to invest or are you using it, uh, in terms of saying, you know, if it's doesn't have AI, it's not getting my money?\n\nNo, we we're using it everywhere every day to reduce costs. If you think about all the many of the investments we have, we have to make decisions daily about customer acquisition, customer maintenance, customer risk. Think about when you're insuring something, we we use AI to try and determine what the fraud risk would be policy by policy. It touches everything we do. And and the reason that you see the S&P at all-time highs, one of them, I would argue to you, is the fact that AI is such an a productivity enhancer to all 11 sectors of the economy. That's why I say if if you're a company looking for investment, from me at least, and you don't have AI and you can't show me how you built it into your cost structure, you're gonna lose. You're gonna fail because your competitor is already incorporating it. And I and I see it in use every single day in every sector. It's our biggest cost. It's at least our fastest growing cost is investing in AI. And the rewards are incredible. I mean, just I look at our our own business. You know, we have a port, we have over 50 companies that are private just in the US alone across every sector. We do wireless charging, uh, you know, a tech, we've got commercial kitchens for airlines. I mean, it's just it all uses AI. It's all there. We do consumer goods and snacking. It's all AI. We're doing so much consumer research. Wine business, forecasting weather for crops in Washington, Walla Walla Valley. It's all AI and it's an inexpensive. It used to cost a fortune five years ago and now every like Groank just came out Thursday. Groank 4, I think. It's it's way better than its first iterations. It's all accelerating. But what do they all need? Data centers. Goes right back where we started.\n\nAnd another thing, you know, we I did bring up earlier and you brought it up as well, kind of the conflict, if you will, or the differences between you and Mr. Wonderful. Uh, he he was kind of earlier on, though he was more along the lines of NFTs. Uh, you were not a fan of crypto at first. You were very vocal about it and then that changed, of course. Now you have separate investment thesis on, uh, basically on crypto, but looking ahead, how are you guys in terms of AI?\n\nOh, we agree on AI. I mean, you know, Mark and I have worked together for so long. It's hard to see and we even have investments together from all of the stuff we did on Shark Tank. It's hard to see, uh, that we won't be in sync on on, uh, on AI. I mean, it just, you know, he's a he's an he's an advocate for this. He's also an advocate for government policy on this as I am. Um, uh, I I I, you know, we don't have to agree on individual investments and and we will we will both have our winners and and losers. It's just the way it is. But I have learned now to work, I look at executional excellence at the management level and I'm pretty good at assessing which guys are winners or men or women are winners or losers and um, and then I look at the market that they're going into and then I see what kind of a position can I establish.\n\nAnd you know, and and I look for big opportunities and and I let me give you an example. You know, I I spend a fair amount of, I get up pretty early in the morning and I look at all the deal flow that comes at me and I was looking at one the other day and I'm starting to do some more work on when you look at AI at the policy level of government, um, and you find companies that are advising the government in defense, for example, and they go public, they're wildly successful, but who's doing it for the rest of world? Who's doing it in Cambodia? Who's doing it in Vietnam? Who's doing it in Venezuela? Who's doing it in South Korea? Who's They don't have the resources to do the same thing that China, the US does. There's an investment thesis for you right there. And so I got to look at that. That's where I was with Circle ago. So I got I have to start looking for because I'm I'm I'm well known all around the world. I'm very lucky. You know, I grew up in Cyprus and I've lived in the Middle East. I've lived Ethiopia, Tunisia, Cambodia, Germany, Japan, you know, and so I took an international view and I I'm very fortunate. I've had this experience that Shark Tank's number one in 52 countries now. So, who knew that would happen? It's like a I feel like I'm an ambassador for the American dream. In some ways, I am. And so, I look for big ideas. Big ideas. And then I try and establish a place in them and then I work with the management to tell that story. That's what I do.\n\nI I I was I was going to ask you, you brought up Shark Tank. My 10-year-old unfortunately can't be here because he's actually right now taking an AI class at the local community college. He's one of your biggest fans. He turns 10 in a in a couple of weeks. Um, but what would you His question for you was this. First of all, what would what kind of advice would you give him right now? Second of all, uh, this coming season, have you guys shot it? Anything exciting that particularly got caught your eye?\n\nYeah, it was really, we have shot it. Um, uh, your son's doing the right thing, taking these advanced classes to learn more about AI because that's the future. It's, you know, this is, he will, he'll find a career there. There's no question about it. This is not going away. This is bigger than the internet was. And so, um, it's very important. Shark Tank is always two years ahead of the American economy. So what I'm seeing now, what I'm doing due diligence on now, um, is, uh, what's going to be in the market in 24 months and I can tell you, uh, one of the fastest growing segments is healthy foods foods. Uh, all of a sudden, the American consumer has started to focus on what they stick in their bodies and I've never seen anything like it. These companies that are coming on Shark Tank are growing 30% a quarter. I mean, they're just going through the roof because they they can make food that's better to eat, um, at a lower cost that tastes good. And so that's one giant trend and I made some great investments there.\n\nIs that the the ompic zepbound effect?\n\nUh, well, I I would argue it's a push back against, uh, that that people don't want to take drugs to lose weight. They want to eat good food instead. And so, you know, there's both happening. But I don't take, uh, any of those ompic drugs, not for weight loss. And I and I'm being told that maybe micro doing it could be good for longevity. I haven't done it yet though because I'm very down the road on longevity. Uh, I I use intermittent fasting and, uh, watching what I eat, uh, in terms of ingredients, protein. I'm trying to eat 160 grams of protein every day. That's a whole different story. But it's sort of the way you you modify. And I've lost, you know, 80 pounds and my blood pressure has gone way down and all kinds of other good outcomes, but it's sort of like, um, the trend within the Shark Tank deals. And then we saw some really interesting stuff in in pet care. You know, one of my biggest successes with Bass Paws a few seasons ago, and we've seen a lot more pet products. Um, I mean, I didn't know that 40% of dogs in America have anxiety attacks when their when their, uh, owners leave them, but I can't say anymore, but imagine solving for that. And so, a lot of, you know, a lot of people worry about their dogs because it's, you know, part of their families. So, all of this stuff is coming. It's a fantastic season. Deals were huge. I mean, and the guest sharks, you know, we had a ton of them. Like a ton of really interesting people, you know, uh, celebrity investors, big investors in different sectors, really interesting online AI guys, internet guys. I mean, all of it, you know, that Shark Tank's so big now as a platform. It just it's it's just interesting to watch it. But I guarantee you, you will see some crazy deals this year. It'll probably, um, debut sometime in September. Uh, but the deals are spectacular.\n\nAnd of course, because it's more consumer products, we won't see any crypto-related, uh, investments this season.\n\nDon't make that assumption. Do not make that assumption.\n\nInteresting.\n\nYeah.\n\nOh, that nice cliffhanger there. So, I I I kind of want to I kind of want to do real quick a bunch of questions, uh, because our our time is almost over. Um, Bitcoin 2026, where do you think it will be? Above or below 200K?\n\nUm, well, I mean, we're just speculating here. I think it, my answer is is contingent on the structure act clearing. If it does clear, it'll be over 200k because it'll allow\n\n\nYou know people talk about the excitement of institutional capital coming into Bitcoin. It really hasn't done any of it yet compared to what it could be because it really wants to get the SEC to regulate whether it's a you know a security or or commodity. And I think we all believe it's a commodity. So let's just put it out there as law. That would be great if that happens north of 200. If not, probably below it. But that's just a speculation. Will it remain on the consciousness of financial services? Yes, it will. As will dig digital payment systems. Uh crypto's out of the bag now. It's never going back in. It's never going away. I think even Elizabeth Warren's figured that out.\n\nDo you think uh do you think we'll see more growth in tokenized tea bills or or do you think that that will more be along the lines of stable coin growth? I think the stable coin infrastructure act uh will allow for more tokenization. Tokenization is already occurring for accredited investors in real estate. I think uh Blackstone or BlackRock's already done that. Um but we want it for the everyday investor. Tokenization of securities makes it a lot better for audit reasons and a lot more transparent and would allow you to keep I mean one of the great things about Robin Hood is you know it's it's uh not I not that I'm promoting Robin Hood over any other but you can hold a complete portfolio of stocks and ETFs and crypto in one place and I think most of the broker dealers are going to have to get there because crypto is going to become part of everybody's portfolio over the years certainly with the new generation uh they want you know two or 3% waiting in crypto or whatever it's going to be and they want it in the same account and I think that's what um companies like Robin Hood have have established with these upcoming bills that are that are about to get signed uh well one getting signed on Friday but uh potentially one in the near future um what which one of your bets do you see um panning out the most?\n\nYou mean my best investment around that? What do you Yeah. What what investment that you have currently do you think will take off when everything is signed?\n\nOh, I I think I'll I'll I think I'll win on data centers more than anything else. Um that will just further fuel the fire for data center demand. Uh that's why I've spent so much time and money in that space. I'm just sitting waiting now. I mean, all I'm doing is running around the world securing the lowest, cleanest power I can because I I figured out, others may have a different view, all that matters is the power. you don't have the power, you don't have anything.\n\nAnd when somebody comes in with an with a pitch to you, not just on the Shark Tank and not just on Shark Tank, but in in the real world, uh it what gets them a second meeting?\n\nYou know, that's a great question. Um that's a great question. I'll and I'll be honest with you.\nI I I want to do business with people I can trust.\nWhat gets you a second meeting with me is\nI know how to find out if you're someone I can trust. And I can do it pretty quickly. And if if if I have an intuitive gut feeling that I can trust you, you'll get a second meeting.\nAnd if I don't, we'll just never talk again. I don't want to be just, you know, discourteous. It doesn't matter. But I I don't want to work with people I I I can't trust. I'm so fortunate that I see so much and I get offered so much and and um and I very very fortunate to be able to choose where I spend my time and money and I I don't really do it for the money anymore. I don't need more money. I need more time. And if I'm going to be spending my time, I'd rather work with people. I don't have to like you. That's not important. And you don't have to like me. But I need to know you're someone when you tell me something. It's the truth. And I'm not going to find out otherwise later. And I'm the same to you. I need to respect you. You need to respect me. And that's all that matters. We can weather the storm together. If it's on mutual trust.\nAnd the minute you tell me something that's not true, it's over. It's just over. And there's nothing you can do to fix it. And I've parted ways with people like that. Even leaving millions of dollars on the table. I don't care. It's a philosophy you learn as you go through your journey as an entrepreneur because I know there's no destination for me. It's just a journey and always will be. I've learned some rules of the road and that's my most important one.\n\nGetting getting back to this fundamental discussion we had earlier and I I kind of made a joke of it but actually she seemed to have taught you a lot about capital allocation probably more than anybody else. That was your mom.\nHow would she look at your current portfolio? How would she look at your current thesis? And what would she tell you right now?\n\nWell, I have stuck with her philosophy uh which was very simple. No more than 5% in any one stock or bond. No more than 20% in any one sector. There's 11 sectors in the economy. The only exception that I have broken that for ever and still is real estate. It's 33%. A wide range. I just like real estate. I have a lot of it. it's served me well for decades and decades and decades and I'm pretty good at it. So, it's something I know well. And so, at the end of the day, uh she would look at my portfolio today with the exception of the real estate and say, \"You have done well and you have followed my advice to your advantage.\"\nShe's the one that saved my Heiney in big downturns and big explosions like in crypto and the FTX stuff and all that. just, you know, um I think about how horrific those days were in crypto, the FTX, Binance stuff, both those guys ended up in prison, but it's sort of like during that period, the advice she gave me really rung true and she was sitting on my shoulder, you know, and she said, \"Always tell the truth and you'll never have to remember what you said.\" And that was very important during the chaos of FTX. Um and and then also stick by the rules of diversification and and I did and um you know remarkably we don't know the end of the game yet but FTX may be the most successful bankruptcy in US history. Um I think they're quoting 140% on accounts there now. And so it's it's uh it's remarkable just remarkable. That just shows you in the long run, tell the truth, stay focused on a principle of diversification investing and you will survive. And that is the wisdom of our moms.\n\nThat's right.\nKevin, thank you so much. Kevin O'Leary, thank you so much for for talking with us. Everything from from tariffs to data centers to and of course to digital assets. It it's always sharp, always direct, and always truthful. Thank you again for joining the block uh for this hour and uh we hope to see you soon.\nThank you. Really enjoyed it. Take care.\nBye bye.\nThanks. Hope to see you soon. Take care.\nBye bye.\nWe have to wait for that upload now.\nI think we have to wait for the upload.\nYeah. But it was great talking to you.\nI'm I'm uh glad we uh we we got a chance to talk again and I hope\n",
