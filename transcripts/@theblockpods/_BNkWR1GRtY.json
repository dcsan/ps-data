  "cleanText": "Welcome to The Crypto Beat. My name is Tim Copeland, and I'm the head of growth at The Block. Joining me today, we have Alluvial CEO Mara Schmiedt. Welcome to the show. How's it going?\n\nThanks for having me, Tim. So, before we get started, just a quick reminder that if you are hiring in crypto, you should use Campus. Out of all your candidates, it will help you pick out the real crypto natives. Head to theblock.co/campus to get a three-month free trial. Now, today's episode focuses on Ethereum institutional Ethereum staking. So first up, just to set the scene, what is Alluvial? What does it do?\n\nYeah, so Alluvial provides next-generation staking services for institutions, large-scale enterprises. We integrate with custodians, exchanges, and different market participants. Alluvial is actually also the development services company behind the liquid collective, which is the leading institutional-grade staking standard in the market.\n\nOkay. So what does that mean when it comes to liquid collective? What does it mean to be the standard in the market?\n\nWe've developed liquid collective, and this kind of goes back to our origin story actually, and I think it's an interesting one to share. We saw a perceived need in the market, particularly within the institutional space, as it relates to the liquid staking services that were offered and available at the time. This was around 2021, 2022. I was actually at Coinbase following the acquisition of Bison Trails, which was one of the leading staking infrastructure providers in the space. And we were really, really excited at the time about a lot of the innovation that was happening in the space with things like multi-operator orchestration and providing better security measures as a result of it, liquid staking unlocking additional utility for staked assets, and improvements in capital efficiency. But one of the challenges that we ran into at the time was really leveraging these kinds of innovations and technologies in a way that would work with the design requirements that sophisticated and regulated institutions have when it comes to counterparty risk assessments, when it comes to compliance requirements on the KYC and AML side, and being able to seamlessly integrate these services into their existing custody or exchange platforms. And so that was really the beginning of liquid collective that was developed in conjunction with design partners including Coinbase, Kraken, and Figment at the time to really build out a liquid staking standard that could interoperate across different market participants and enterprises in the space to really accelerate adoption in the institutional vertical.\n\nAnd when you say for things like AML, is it the case that is it so like if an individual wants to stake through you as a provider, you have to make sure that they are fully like KYC, is that what you mean by that?\n\nThat's right. The model looks quite similar to USDC, for example. So minting and redemption, so the deposit of ETH, in the case of LS ETH, which is the product, they actually get screened through platforms that already have provision KYC/L requirements. So when you think about onboarding through something like Coinbase Exchange or Anchorage if you're a custody client, market participants already go through some of these checks and balances, and so the minting process itself kind of mirrors the behaviors of what you would see with something like USDC. Once LS ETH is minted against the staked ETH position or in the case of other products, then actually it's permissionlessly tradable in the ecosystem. You can use it in DeFi, you can trade it permissionlessly. And so that was really, really important because when you think about institutional compliance requirements, one of the things that we stumbled into was sort of this concept of comingled assets and understanding where assets are actually coming from when market participants interact but then also withdraw ETH from these different solutions and protocols.\n\nOkay. So why is it okay to have sort of essentially like permissionless movement of the liquid staking assets when you have to like have such trick procedures during the sort of onboarding and offboarding process? Is that because you're not directly interacting with the counterparties?\n\nYeah, it's a really interesting question. So I think the main principle or the main principle of concern, and let's take just a permissionless, you know, fully permissionless minting and deposit model as an example, when you deposit into a permissionless protocol and you effectively withdraw ETH from it later, you don't actually know whose ETH you're getting back, right? Because all of the ETH that sits underneath it is fungible, and so it makes it really hard to track back, you know, if that ETH has in any way interacted in a way that would create compliance issues internally for some of these regulated businesses. Now, the LST or the liquid staking token that lives on top of that is really acts more as a receipt or a proof of ownership of the underlying staked assets. And so, market participants are more freely able to decide how and where they want to transact with these once they're minted. And I think that gives rise to many different use cases, right? Where you on one hand can onboard institutional market participants to use these products and and also leverage them both in centralized and decentralized marketplaces depending on their needs and their and their wants. But it also opens up a universe where, you know, ordinary retail users can seamlessly transact with these products in the market.\n\nYeah. Okay. And how does how do you solve that issue with the withdrawals?\n\nHow do we solve the issue with the withdrawals? So any minting or deposit of ETH and any withdrawal of ETH goes through any of these what we call supported platforms. These are platforms that have effectively gone through compliance screening with our compliance partner Capgemini. And so it's the same mechanism. If you effectively take an LS ETH receipt and you look to redeem it, you're actually going to one of these supported platforms to get ETH back. And so that ensures the consistency in both the deposit and the redemption flows and the access points through which they're enabled.\n\nI see. So you're only withdrawing ETH from like a pool of funds where you know all the ETH that put that went into that pool was checked on the way in. That's right. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. So yesterday you announced a partnership between Liquid Collective and Galaxy. Uh, what's the was the collaboration there?\n\nYeah, we we're really excited to get that out, and it seems like great timing to cover that today. We announced a holistic partnership with Galaxy that covers a number of different verticals through liquid collective. Galaxy is going to be providing OTC support and also collateral acceptance for LSE through its trading desk. Galaxy is going to be offering Liquid Collectives products, including the expansion of certain products to Solana, to its asset management clients, and then Galaxy is actually also joining liquid collectives active set alongside Blockdaemon, Figment, staked, and Blockdaemon to provide node operator services to the network. That actually follows on the back of them being one of the founding members of NORS, our note operator risk standard that was developed in conjunction with I think 12 or 13 different market participants. And so we're quite excited about that. I think in many ways this also signals I think just a growing institutional appetite for liquid staking products in the market, and I think we're seeing a lot of that movement happening now in the staking space generally, but then the liquid staking space specifically. So we're really excited to see that. I think a lot of these things in the end really rely on having fully integrated suites of services that meet collateral needs, trading demands, the custody needs of the different market participants that interact in the space.\n\nOkay. So when you mentioned like Solana, is this like expanding to Solana for the first time in this respect?\n\nYeah. Well, stay tuned for more. But we teased some of this announcement as part of the collaboration yesterday. Galaxy is going to be a part of this expansion, and we're excited to announce more launch partners as we get ready to take this product to market.\n\nOkay. Do you think there's a lot of like demand for institutional Solana staking? I know there's obviously a lot of locked Solana sort of that's going around ever since the FTX estate. I had a chat recently with AEXI, which has bought it for their balance sheet. So it's just is there just a lot of demand there?\n\nI think in general, we're seeing a growing demand for institutional staking at large, and I think that's true across all networks. If you look at some of these statistics, but then also some of the milestones that we're seeing in the market, you have things like, you know, ETH hitting all-time highs on staked assets on the network. I think that was only yesterday, not in price. Yeah. Not in price. Um, not yet anyways. You have major industry giants like, you know, Fidelity and Grayscale filing for staking inclusions in the ETH ETFs. You see filings for Solana ETFs that hopefully will include staking and due force. And of course, you're mentioning the corporate treasury strategies. I think we're seeing there sort of a really early use case for what it could look like to have, you know, a cryptobacked and denominated treasury strategy where staking really unlocks more treasury-like reward rates for market participants and those corporate treasuries as well. So I think overall, like it it seems like we're sort of seeing holistic trends of the institutional market coming on chain, participating on chain, but also leveraging, you know, the benefits that proof of stake networks provide holistically when it comes to unlocking reward rates and then more particularly unlocking additional usage, and I think that's where liquid staking tokens play a particular role when you think about, you know, standardized asset management function or corporate treasury function. In the end, you know, market participants will look for the best risk-adjusted returns. In some ways, liquid staking tokens don't just unlock, you know, seamless and in some ways risk-mitigated access to staking rewards, but they actually also enable and unlock liquidity and composability in other parts of the ecosystem, including DeFi. And I think that's where things start becoming really interesting to really unlock, you know, the power that, you know, these composable technologies enable.\n\nAnd what do you think of the trend of companies adding ETH to their balance sheet? Like obviously there's a lot of companies doing with Bitcoin. You've seen a few starting to do it with ETH. Um, although doesn't seem to be going too well for Sharp Link.\n\nSo I think I think this trend is is really, really interesting. I think one thing that you know, I tend to say is that, you know, staking itself tends to be overlooked and sort of its ability to generate fully uncorrelated, you know, reward rates for market participants that are not necessarily tied to things like interest rates or monetary policies that are that are sort of nationbound. And I think that's going to become an increasingly important factor as market participants look for, you know, diversified strategies, but also diversified income products in the market. I think that ESPED and and the ETH treasury, but also other treasury strategies that we're seeing sort of unlock in the market obviously unlock a very new interesting component, which is staking reward rates, right? And I think that sort of unlocks new opportunities for for these corporate treasuries to get access to that T-bill-like rate of return while contributing to network security.\n\nInteresting. Do you think staking rewards could become definitely more interesting if say like treasury yields dropped?\n\nI would certainly think so. I think as we're sort of seeing this convergence, and I think this reminds me a little bit of, you know, the really early days of when things like the serenity spec got designed, you know, it felt like a lot of the design parameters around the network were really, you know, one happening in a zero interest rate environment as a starting point, but then also I think really self-contained in the way that they, you know, architected certain parameters, particularly because taking reward rates are directly tied to a network security budget and so adjust somewhat autonomously. I think that gives rise to two interesting dynamics. One, you know, as we see this convergence between the cryptonative market and, you know, the traditional financial services markets sort of converge, I think market participants will more holistically look at, you know, what the different rates of returns are that are available in the market and we'll make allocation decisions accordingly. And so as interest rates are expected to continue coming down, you know, you would expect that the reward rates that are offered by proof of stake networks become increasingly attractive. But I think to my earlier point, I think there's there's sort of a secondary piece to this, which is those looking for uncorrelated rewards, right? That are tied to staking that are sort of separate from monetary policies or inflation rates. I think that starts becoming quite interesting as sort of an alternative strategy for those allocations as well.\n\nYeah, the um the sort of converging of crypto and traffic definitely seems to be a rapidly growing trend at the moment. I mean, you're seeing exchanges now starting to look to offer tokenized stocks and you know, people are sort of joking that we've now sort of almost gone full circle back to back to Trafi. Like what do you make of this trend?\n\nI feel like we're absolutely seeing this convergence, right? You're seeing cryptonative platforms tokenizing stock, and then you're seeing traditional financial services businesses, you know, adopting cryptonative assets, and it feels like these, you know, these things are starting to really converge, um, I think a lot more prominently than what we've seen in the last couple of years. It's it's kind of interesting. I some way in in which I like to think about this, and it's sort of my personal perspective. It feels a little bit like we're moving along this curve from incremental innovation like tokenized stocks or real-world assets if we want to call them that to eventually having, you know, truly on-chain products and solutions, and I think, you know, obviously Ethereum, Solana, but also the properties that they offer through staking is is going to be a big component of that, and it feels like we're slowly moving along this adoption curve where we'll have truly native, you know, internet native assets, an internet native yield that is getting unlocked as as these market participants move along that adoption curve.\n\nAnd if we see a lot more adoption of sort of traditional assets within crypto, do you think that will increase the demand for the sort of services that like Olivia offers for instance because you're going to need to have similar risk profile mitigation because it's all especially when you're dealing with traditional equities and everything, but then they'll have to do it in in a way that's compatible with\n\n\nWith the blockchain.\nYeah, for sure.\nI mean, I think we're definitely seeing a lot more traction.\nI mean, even just across our business when it comes to, you know, the growth that we've seen in the last, you know, call it two months even, um, since the staking guidance now recently got released by the SEC, we're seeing a lot more of the particularly US market unlock.\nI think that's going to be another massive accelerant when you think, when you see things like staked ETFs getting approved.\nUm, I think in reality a lot of these institutions will look for very robust tooling, gateways, and access points so they can holistically package their services into their existing businesses, into their distribution channels.\nI think the things that, you know, we've learned in and sort of servicing this market for the last couple of years is that really robust security, really robust performance optimization, you know, compliance-focused design, um, and and native qualified custody integrations are all going to be really, really important aspects, um, of the types of technologies that, you know, these incumbent institutions will ultimately leverage to provide these services to their clients.\nWhat did you think about the recent SEC guidance?\nWere you surprised to see it come out?\nI was not surprised to see it come out.\nUm, we were excited.\nI guess it was probably the right word.\nUm, it did seem like it was moving maybe even a little bit faster than we had initially anticipated internally at least, which is a good signal.\nI think that's also a good signal for some of the other topics that are sort of on the agenda for coverage, like extending this guidance to contemplate things like liquid staking tokens or the inclusion of staking in ETFs.\nUm, so I think overall it's a very, very positive signal.\nUm, I think that, you know, in many ways it feels like market participants are going to be materially unlocked in offering these services.\nNow if you think back to the former administration and a lot of the challenges and difficulties that came in offering staking services under a clear regulatory format, I think a lot of that, you know, is going to serve as a as a tailwind now for market participants that want to offer that.\nI think one of the important distinguishing factors in the guidance that is just worth, you know, sort of mentioning is, you know, staking when it provides network security should not be considered a security.\nNow staking if framed as staking but actually under the hood, you know, resembling more like a fractional reserve model or like a lending product, you know, should be adequately classified as that and and and has separate, you know, investment contract analysis attached to it.\nAnd I think it's really, really important that we clearly separate what these functions are, what distinguishes them, um, because ultimately that drives the right consumer protection, um, that I think we all want to see, you know, uh, clarified in the market.\nIs there much difference between staked ETH and liquid staking tokens?\nIs there much difference between staked ETH and liquid staking tokens?\nSo I think the the way that we think about the analysis is, um, that liquid staking tokens resemble proof of ownerships or title of ownerships, um, and we really truly view them as receipts.\nAnd so when you think about the commodity space, for example, and this is like a good analogy, and you have, you know, corn or you have livestock, you know, in a warehouse, um, when you're effectively trading in the commodity space, you're not actually moving like the corn from one silo to another.\nUm, what you're doing is you're actually trading, um, against the receipts, um, of those warehouse bills or those titles of ownership, um, that that demonstrate that beneficial ownership structure for the underlying commodity.\nIt's no different if that kind of concept is applied, you know, um, in in the digital realm, right?\nETH that's being staked and a receipt that bene, you know, that demonstrates that beneficial ownership, you know, is sort of subject to the same analysis, and I think that's why we have, you know, very, very strong, um, arguments for why LSTs is sort of that enabling layer, um, shouldn't be considered as securities either.\nUm, so I hope, hopefully that answers that.\nI think, you know, we look at this more as, you know, no separate asset, a receipt on the underlying, um, that can unlock material, you know, benefits when it comes to utilization, uh, collateralization, other things that are ultimately important in a mature financial system, uh, for any type of asset or any type of commodity.\nOkay.\nAnd, um, what do you think about the growth of, I guess, both staked ETH and liquid staking tokens as a whole?\nI mean, you mentioned earlier that we've now hit above 35 million ETH staked.\nI so I think, um, it it feels a little bit like we're at an inflection point now, I think in large because the institutional market, large-scale businesses, particularly retail platforms, have kind of had to sit on the sidelines, particularly in the US, for the last couple of years, uh, in offering these products.\nI think there's a reason why we're starting to see, you know, stake amount ratios coming up and sort of reaching all-time highs on a relative basis.\nI think a lot of that is driven by the institutional market.\nYou're starting to see much more institutional participation in staking.\nYou see new categories of market participants, corporate treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, you know, coming into the space and and starting to leverage the opportunity that the technology provides.\nWhen you look at things like, you know, the ETF market alone, you have what, around $9 billion, um, in the US ETFs, um, that is currently not utilized, not staked.\nSo the ratios actually start looking quite material when you start bringing in, you know, the capital and distribution power that we see in, you know, more traditional financial markets, and so I think we should expect that to trend up.\nI think on Ethereum it's particularly interesting because I think we have, um, only about 30% of ETH staked today, and so there's it feels like a long way to go in sort of, uh, leveraging the utilization on the network relative to something like Salana where I think the ratio is closer to 70% today.\nAnd what do you think of the lawsuits or the sort of like attack on staking in the US?\nAnd obviously sort of Coinbase has been a big, big target, but with that, you've seen Illinois and Alabama drop their staking lawsuits against Coinbase.\nLike, do you think that's starting to change?\nIs there is there promising uh light there?\nYeah, I mean, I think that look, that the SEC staking guidance was a massive, you know, step in the right direction to clarify what technical staking services are, what categorizes them, and also what distinguishes them from things that maybe look more like lending programs, right?\nAnd I think that was very, very important.\nUm, it feels like we're in a very different universe now than where we were maybe even a couple of months ago.\nUm, and I think that's ultimately going to be a good thing, right, to unlock, you know, participation.\nIf you think about it in some ways, you know, market participants that are unable to offer staking inside of their products, um, are not going to be rendered competitive in the global sort of landscape of things.\nParticularly if you think about them already offering services like holding their crypto, using their crypto to support network uh security and then also being able to earn rewards on it.\nKind of starts feeling like table stakes uh in terms of the services that I think we'll start seeing uh a lot of these market players offer.\nOkay.\nAnd how important is it do you think for the ETFs to start offering staking or to start including that?\nVery important.\nI think the reality is that you have jurisdictions like Canada and Switzerland where staking has already been approved for certain ATPs and ETFs.\nUm, I think again for US products to be competitive, they're they're going to have to offer, you know, the inclusion of staking in their solutions because, you know, it's sort of a loss for the investor not having access to these reward rate.\nIt actually renders these products less competitive than just, you know, uh, staking your ETH if you have it on your own balance sheet or through another vehicle or asset manager, and so I think that's quite material if you look at the what like $9 billion dollars in AUM that's managed in US ETFs and you take the you\n3.  1% reward rate on ETH.\nThat's 280 million annualized in rewards that are not getting paid out and then are not being made and then are also not securing the network.\nRight?\nSo, I think it ends up being quite material at sort of the scale and size that we're looking at in the markets.\nBut I'm quite optimistic, you know, based on where things are heading, um, that we're not far away from these things getting approved for Ethereum and then fingers crossed also hopefully for Salana soon.\nIf you ended up with sort of ETFs having a huge amount of sort of staked ETH, would that potentially give them like quite a large control over the network to some degree?\nI think this question comes up a like a few times.\nI think, um, overall if you look at the sort of centralization trends, um, in network stake over the last couple of years, things have actually continuously trended towards being more decentralized.\nAnd I'm not just speaking about, you know, the node operator level or the counterparty level, but then also like a couple of layers deeper if you think about execution clients, consensus layer clients, you know, cloud providers on prem that people are deploying against.\nSo I think the trend has continuously moved towards a more resilient and more distributed and more decentralized, um, supporting structure for staking.\nI think more market participants, more diverse market participants coming into, um, the staking space is a good thing, right, on a net basis to continue diversifying the market players that, you know, contribute, but also to sort of pave the way to mainstream adoption for the technology at large.\nSure.\nUm, and for the ETFs, it looks like they had about 19 days of inflows before the recent sort of geopolitical turmoil led to prices falling and we've started seeing some outflows again.\nDo you have any any thoughts on the current state of the market given the sort of re recent uh political climate changes?\nYeah, for sure.\nI mean, I think we always try to find like, you know, the silver lining in the data that we're seeing.\nI think spot ETFs having significant inflows, I think somewhere around 700 million in the last month relative to Bitcoin that's actually posted outflows.\nI think those are important metrics to sort of look for.\nUm, and and and things like where is the overall market participation and staking, um, and and sort of where does that trend out.\nSo I think these are important metrics.\nUm, I think there's sort of the price, you know, participation action.\nAnd I think that's sort of secondary to that, which I think in large, you know, continues to be heavily influenced by what's happening in the macro environment and also the geopolitical space at the moment.\nOkay.\nAnd do you think it's a good sign to see Truth Socialing for a Bitcoin and Ethereum combo ETF?\nI think that, um,\nI think it feels a little bit like we've had sort of the pendulum swing, you know, from one direction to another.\nI think as part of the the shift in the administration, I think that comes with good things like, you know, a very serious SEC crypto task force, you know, the passing of uh the Genius Act in in the Senate.\nI think there's very, very positive momentum for crypto at large, stable coin regulation, clarity on staking guidance and all of these things, you know, together.\nI think when where the pendulum maybe swings far is sort of the the the current, you know, um, political appetite, particularly in the US, to sort of push the boundaries on, you know, what you know, what the involvement might be within the administration offering and scaling some of these products themselves, and so I think we'll we'll see probably a recalibration on that.\nI think right now it's helpful for the ecosystem to to be able to innovate, to be able to grow fast, to capitalize on the market opportunity, um, and I think hopefully we'll sort of find the right pendulum swing of where, you know, things need to be and how they need to be regulated at some point, um, to ensure that, you know, consumers and investors are are in a good position and protected ultimately.\nOkay.\nAnd what really unlocks the next level uh for staking?\nI think broad crypto adoption in general, right?\nLike to me it's like staking is like the pattern that you see from like when you get people to hold uh crypto.\nThe next question that they'll start asking is what can I do with it, right?\nAnd then staking sort of falls naturally into the cycle of okay, I can stake it, I can trade it, eventually I can actually use it.\nAnd that's where DeFi and sort of that connectivity starts becoming really interesting.\nThe more market participants that hold crypto, the more market participants that are able to access crypto.\nI think the bigger the universe or the you know, total surface area of of market that you know, can be served through that, and I think it's a little bit analogous to saying, you know, the more um, bank accounts people have, the more savings accounts they will have, the more access to these kinds of products and services will be important and useful for them.\nAnd so to me everything feels like sort of a broad market catalyst.\nI think if we think about the adoption of where crypto is at and how we get, you know, crypto usage into the hands of like everyday people, um, as they're on ramping through, you know, stable coin products or uh, cryptonative products in the market.\nAll right, broader broader crypto adoption it is.\nUm, cool, well that is all we have time for today.\nUh, I want to thank Mara Schmiedt for joining this episode.\nAnd as a reminder, Unus works tirelessly to get you accurate, informed crypto news.\nIf you want to stay ahead, read the blog.\nThanks and see you next time.\n",
