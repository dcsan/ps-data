  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nHello and welcome to the CryptoBeep. My name is Tim Copeland. I'm The Block's head of growth. Joining me today, we have Daniel Jacobs, founder and CEO of Thrive Protocol. Welcome to the show. How you doing?\n\nI'm doing great. It's great to be here, Tim.\n\nAmazing. Before we get started, just a quick note. If you are hiring in crypto, you should use Campus out of all your candidates. Help you pick out the real crypto natives. Head to the block.co/campus to get a three-month free trial. Now, today's episode is around crypto grants funding. That's obviously something that Thrive is particularly focused on. So what is Thrive?\n\nYeah. So, um, Thrive is, you know, at this point, we believe the biggest builder protocol in the space. We support over $100 million in committed capital allocations from a lot of the top chains in the space. And we support builders and founders and very quickly working, uh, in crypto and and with top chains and working in a way that creates value, that that creates GDP for the ecosystems that they support.\n\nAnd where did the idea for Thrive come from? Like, what, what inspired it?\n\nYeah. So I got into crypto way back in 2013. I read Satoshi's white paper and I was really inspired by what I believed was a treatise on fairness. This idea that with this big open transparent database, it doesn't matter who you are or where you are or what your background is, if you create value, you can and should and will be rewarded proportionate to the value you create. Um, but I also believe that there was a problem with the blockchain because the blockchain is great at validating that a transaction is valid, proving validity of a transaction, but it's not great at proving value. And I believed even way back in 2013 that something like Thrive would need to exist to help decentralized communities to really deeply um understand that value was created and be able to reward it. So even in November of 2013, I registered the domain for Thrive. But it turns out I was running another organization at that time, it would take another eight and a half years to sell that company, another few months for a friend to go on a walk with the beach with me. And and he said, \"Yo, Daniel, whatever happened to that Thrive idea of yours?\" And I wondered who had built it. And so I went back and looked and nobody had. And I realized that I had to found another organization. And that was kind of the beginning of Thrive.\n\nCool. So, so you were sort of aware of crypto since 2013, but at what point um were you actively involved? Like, did you did you stay active throughout that time? Um, what was your journey like?\n\nYeah, I've been actively involved since about four years ago when when I founded Thrive. Um, I had been involved in crypto in different ways um beforehand, but certainly not running a business. This this is the first project, the first organization that I've been a part of within the context of of crypto. And you know, some backgrounds on kind of what Thrive does. We we actually built kind of a a product, a protocol that addresses sort of that major problem that I noticed way back in 2013. So the protocol is called Thrive Protocol. And what it does is it proves that value uh has occurred. And the way that it works is when somebody creates something of value, they submit evidence for that through the protocol and that evidence is routed to some number of either certified experts, people who are capable of reviewing whatever that evidence is, data or code or financial information and also some number of AI agents that score in the upper quartile of accuracy of those experts and when a threshold of them agreed the value is created then a thing is paid out and it's attested to on chain. And what that allows for is it allows foundations and decentralized crypto communities for the first time to make investments uh in you know not just a few teams or people and know that they're going to create value aligned with what they promise but in dozens or hundreds theoretically even thousands of teams and know that they effectively have 100% capital efficiency with those investments. We really believe that it's been gamechanging in the space.\n\nSure. So, how does that work in terms of the people that review the uh investments? Like, do they get paid for it? What's their incentive?\n\nThat's exactly right. So, um, they they get paid in um, you know, depending on uh the orientation of the review. It could be in um uh different currencies of the communities that we support uh or now that um they are also earning Thrive points as they go too. But they only get paid when they accurately review. So they're heavily incentivized to review accurately.\n\nAnd who reviews the reviewers?\n\nSo, um, anybody can challenge a uh the outcome of review. Um, a reviewer who um supposedly did not review accurately or even the recipient. Uh, so the contributor or the builder uh whose product was uh being reviewed and that is effectively reviewed by another level of reviewers who um uh did not participate in the original review and have a level of accuracy that um entitles them to let's call it a special badge, special access.\n\nOkay. So you go to sort of a hierarchy of review.\n\nAnd uh at what point did you start introducing AI agents to the mix?\n\nIf we go back a year, we started to play around with AI agents and that was a very, very small part of the process. It was, you know, essentially all humans. Today, um, it's effectively flipped. So 90% plus of reviews are done by AI agents and um, around 10% of reviews are done by certified experts who um, are you know, highly capable of of reviewing and and against whom the AI agents accuracy is being uh, judged as well.\n\nSure. And how does um an AI agent review this fully? So let's say the person's claiming, oh, I've gone and built the the protocol, it's got so many users. How do they prove that in a way that they the AI agent can actually verify it like properly?\n\nYeah, I mean there has to be um, you know, a very quantitative understanding of exactly what it is that's supposed to be reviewed and the agent has to have access to uh that information in order to do the review. Um, so it's really important that um, when framing what needs to be reviewed that that's being framed as accurately and directly as possible.\n\nAnd why did you end up like, how come you've got to the point where it's 90% of agents reviewing it? Is it just because it's more efficient? What, what sort of led to that?\n\nI mean, one of the really interesting things that we noticed was um, great reviewers like experts, um, they tend to review at an accuracy rate of 93%, 94%, 95%. Um, my accuracy rate currently after hundreds of reviews is 91%. U maybe it's crept up to 92, right? And when we first started playing around with AI agents, they were reviewing significantly worse than great reviewers. That's changed quite a bit. Right? So now their accuracy rate um uh is generally extremely high. Again, it's um as high or higher than top experts. So with some agents, we're seeing 95, 96, 97% accuracy. And so really it was just a question of efficacy. Um, we want to be sure that at scale um uh work products are being paid fairly. And to be paid fairly, they need to be reviewed fairly. And um being reviewed fairly, you know, is is really it's really a question of accuracy whether we're talking about humans or agents that are trained by humans.\n\nOkay. And what sort of um AI are you using for this? Like, in terms of like which platforms and then as you are you modifying the AI or are you just giving it custom instructions in order you know, to make it effective?\n\nYeah. So, um, we're constantly testing um, you know, different agents or different platforms against each other. We're agnostic about the agent or the modality. Um, really the only thing that we care about is accuracy and um, and so Thrive being agnostic to to modality, it's it's really important for us to continuously test and that will always be the case.\n\nHow do you confirm the accuracy?\n\nRight. So the accuracy initially is confirmed because um there are a threshold of experts and agents that effectively find agreements and depending on the type of thing being reviewed that threshold can be different. I mean on average usually it's around 70%, but in some cases you want that threshold to be as much as 90% or you know, even 100%. So, um, so that's that's how we do the confirmation initially. If it's the case that there's disagreement for whatever reason, then it can be doubly confirmed and you know, then it goes to sort of a higher review process. Additionally, um, the contributors or the builders who are submitting evidence, they're always getting feedback, right, from those those reviewers about um, why it is that uh, whatever let's say the milestone was that was confirmed was actually confirmed or why it was not confirmed and you know, how they can uh, improve their work product, resubmit and get the confirmation that they're looking for.\n\nWhat's the biggest check?\n\nYeah, go for it if you like.\n\nWell, I was going to kind of um, switch over to the other side, which is a really interesting um, component of the work we do. So, when when Thrive started, right, you know, I'd been thinking about this protocol for years before we um, began to build it. And so, we had a sense that the technology was likely going to be effective in um, orienting toward and and um, guaranteeing a level of capital efficiency that is fundamentally distinct in the space. That was cool. The piece that we didn't expect was that, you know, we have kind of implicitly created um, this social graph of top builders and and teams and and founders um, that work through Thrive and in many ways kind of prefer to onboard into crypto through Thrive. And that has been a really unexpected piece. And what we learned is effectively this. When builders come into crypto or even builders who are in crypto, if if you're a builder and you want to work full-time, it's really hard to do that, right? You don't just have to be a builder if you want to get funded um, by, you know, top ecosystems in the space. You also have to be an insider, a salesperson, a diplomat, be willing to go months without being paid sometimes. Um, you know, be potentially publicly humiliated on Twitter if you get onto the wrong Twitter space, right? And if you're a great builder and you're working at Google, why would you go into crypto? And the answer for many builders is it doesn't make any sense, right? Um, that's why they're somewhere around 7,200 full-time builders in crypto and they're around 30 million full-time builders, I mean developers in the world, right? So, Thrive made it a lot easier for, you know, founders and creators and builders to onboard into top ecosystems in crypto because what they do is they effectively apply for an ecosystem within 7 days because we have such a fastforwarded process. they're able to get a yes or no answer within three days after that they can be building. And so we've made the process of onboarding into crypto, of getting paid for actually building and not being all these other things, a salesperson or develop. We made that process so much easier and it's allowed us to fund, you know, we've funded at this at this point over 1500 top teams and builders and creators uh in the space and you know, it's been a really exciting kind of accidental um uh addition to to the experience that we've had here.\n\nOkay. And you talk about um sort of its role in it with regards to mind share and also community building. Would you say there's sort of some comparisons with Kaito? Like, obviously that's you know, it's very popular right now as as sort of a marketing tool.\n\nYeah. I mean, you know, I I see Kaito as, by the way, I love what Kaito is doing. Thrive has a Kaito leaderboard. Um, you know, I think there's a lot of really interesting things that we can do adjacent uh to to Kaito. I see Kaito as um, really wanting to own this space of being the intelligence layer in crypto, of being, you know, I think what they call the the mind share layer in crypto. Um, you know, Thrive, we're we believe that our opportunity is to to build and create the first like really true GDP layer in crypto. um, you know, we fund uh effectively projects when they create value in line with the needs of ecosystems, right? And uh, in crypto, there's a lot of hype around a lot of stuff, but very little actual value being created. And um, so we we really believe that we have the opportunity to to create a GDP layer and I think that sits really nicely alongside a a a mindshare uh layer that that Kaito is attempting to build right now.\n\nAnd you say it's been around for four years. How has the sort of growth been during that time? Like, has it sort of picked up more recently? Has it changed at all?\n\nYeah, so we were um, initially founded in September of 2021 and so it's been almost four years. In a couple months will be four years and it's been an incredible experience. I mean, we have continued to almost double or almost double quarter over quarter for I think 10 straight quarters. Um, we have been really lucky to support a lot of the top ecosystems in the space and um, the committed capital or token allocations that go through drive have continued to grow and grow and grow and we expect the same at the end of the day. I mean, there are different ways to grow in crypto. Um, a lot of projects grow through marketing and and hype and market positioning. Thrive thought about things differently. We, you know, we didn't say a lot. We put our hard hats on, you know, brought our lunch pals to school and did work every day. And, you know, it's been nice to see that it's paying off and that we're able to support so many ecosystems in really meaningful ways.\n\nYeah. If you're that like, you know, well connected to all of these ecosystems, have you wondered about creating a a venture capital fund on the side?\n\nIt's a really interesting question because, you know, somewhere probably a couple quarters ago, people started, you know, thinking of us almost as as venture firms because we funded so many projects, right? Um, so the answer is no, we haven't thought about creating a venture fund on the side. In reality, we actually partner with a lot of venture funds because when venture funds um uh, you know, fund great teams and and builders and put them in their portfolios, they they want those builders to be able to have access to and build in the top ecosystems in the space and um, we are a direct way in which great builders can have access and get paid appropriately. Um, so right now, we really enjoy our partnerships with the the venture firms that that we and the accelerators and the incubators that that we partner with. um, we see ourselves as again, occupying a slightly different space, um, seeking to build this GDP layer of crypto and you know, in the in the future, um, we hope to just continue to expand those partnerships.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges to managing grant funding? First, I'll start at the builder level. I mean, I'll talk about\n\n\nA couple different challenges.\nI'll start it at the builder level.\nUnfortunately, I believe that builders in large part in crypto who work through ecosystems have been socialized to think oftentimes in a grant farming kind of way, right?\nIt's so hard to kind of figure out your way through the system and get funding from an ecosystem.\nOftentimes getting funding is the victory as opposed to creating value, particularly because historically there hasn't been a lot of incentive to actually create value.\nGetting funding is 98% of the battle, and so on the builder side, I think there is a little bit of reimagination that needs to occur.\nBuilders, you know, have the opportunity to kind of close their eyes and understand that we can make this industry operate in a way that looks a lot like all the other ecos, all the other industries that have boomed kind of in history where together we need to think about what it means to build something of significant value that can scale, right?\nWhich is not how a lot of builders who go through the grant process today think.\nWe're trying to support that reimagination because it's connected to the way in which funding is unlocked with Thrive Protocol.\nBuilders get funds when they create value in line with the needs of ecosystems, right?\nSo there's direct, and they don't have to be insiders, right?\nThey don't have to be anything but great builders.\nOn the ecosystem side, I think there's a real opportunity to collectively close their eyes and really deeply understand what they want.\nThe way in which ecosystems historically have created a lot of quote unquote value, at least token value, right, is by creating hype and a lot of BS metrics, right?\nAnd that works for the short term, but it actually doesn't drive sustainability in ecosystems or in Crypto as a whole for the long term or even frankly the medium term.\nAnd so from an ecosystem perspective, there's a real opportunity to kind of think about what it means to build and create and commit to sustainable value for the medium and long term.\nAnd you know, I think when we have builders who are building for value creation and we have ecosystems that are really committed to funding true value creation over time as opposed to short-term hype metrics, then you know, we are starting to talk about a Crypto ecosystem that can drive real GDP, real value, that can invite more than 7,200 full-time builders and so on and so forth.\nAre there any ecosystems that you think have done really well at that?\nMost of the ecosystems that we're working with are committed to that in one way or another because that's, you know, that's practically our sales pitch, right?\nAnd so I think that what we're noticing is that there is more and more ecosystem commitment to that on an ongoing basis.\nI mean, one of our ecosystem partners is Zion, and I had a wonderful conversation yesterday with somebody in their foundation named Z about exactly that.\nWhat does it mean to fund builders who create real value?\nBecause our commitment is to real value for the medium and long term, right?\nAnd very consistently I'm hearing that directionally that's where foundations, you know, are going and frankly that's where they need to go.\nNot just for, you know, the sake of their community or let's say their token price for the medium and long term, but really for the sake of an industry that has the opportunity to be like one of two fundamentally gamechanging industries in humanity, right, alongside AI.\nBut to do it, we need the real talent in this industry to not focus on value extraction and instead to be focused on creating and adding value to the system.\nYeah.\nDo you think the sort of issue of value extraction is one of the biggest issues in Crypto?\nSort of one of the biggest things preventing it from growing even further?\nAbsolutely.\nI mean, if you're a great mind coming into Crypto, I'm oversimplifying here, but you have two choices, and this is a really hard one.\nChoice number two, choice number one is you can make a lot of money in the short term by extracting value from the ecosystem.\nAnd that's what most great minds coming into Crypto do.\nAnd it makes sense, right?\nThey can set their families up, you know, themselves, their communities up with generational wealth for, you know, in a very short amount of time.\nAnd choice number two is that they can build something of real enduring value, right?\nThat also creates a lot of wealth for them, but is way harder and takes a lot longer.\nAnd with most human beings, that's a difficult decision set, right?\nWith most human beings, even good human beings, they choose choice number one, right?\nIt's easier, right?\nThere's a very clear short-term path.\nAnd you know, when Crypto gets enough people choosing choice number two, it's going to create enormous value, much more value than we could create with choice number one.\nBut we've got to get there.\nDo you think it's changed over the years?\nI feel like I want to say 2017, 2018.\nOkay.\nObviously 2017 you had the ICO rush, you had a lot of people wanting to extract value, but I feel in general there were a lot of builders back then who were far more egalitarian who who sort of really wanted to I think just promote really like healthy growth.\nDo you think it's changed much over the years?\nI do think you see a lot of everyone being focused on value extraction these days, right?\nEven if it's not as blatant as the sort of ICO mania.\nI mean, it's pretty sad.\nI have a really good friend who is a venture capitalist and this person has a portfolio of 150 or so investments that they've made over a number of years and they, you know, they were diamond hands, right?\nAnd recently they told me that they came to the conclusion that the only good option is to as quickly as possible sell, right?\nAnd that's a problem when you have people who have been in the ecosystem for years and years and years and years, right?\nWho have been committed to the projects that they've been a part of.\nAnd eventually they realize that if they're going to make any money in this industry, they have to figure out how to stop supporting those projects for the medium and long term, right?\nAnd I see a lot of people who have been in Crypto for a while who eventually become exasperated with the space.\nThey realize that they have to, you know, do the same kinds of things that have worked for others, but they understood were bad for the industry.\nAnd you know, and it's important for us to notice that and it's important for us to you know go wait a second there's something wrong with a lot.\nThere's something wrong with the way historically we've been thinking about tokconomics.\nThere's something, you know, wrong with the way that we've been thinking about how VCs win, you know, when they invest in projects, right?\nBecause often times for venture capitalists to make money off a project, they have to dump the token and there's not enough liquidity to support that project.\nAnd so the venture capitalist wins but the project loses and that is an occurrence that is very very common in our space but that we need to figure out how to create a different path.\nSo there's a lot broken that we need to fix and unfortunately people who have been around for a while have been seeing it for a while.\nThere was a bit of controversy a while ago over whether or not VCs were good or bad for the space because obviously they do provide a lot of funding and provide a lot of support but ultimately their goal you know reasonably is to extract more value than they put in right?\nI was curious, do you have a view on on VCs overall?\nVCs in Crypto tend not to act like VCs in other industries, right?\nThey almost act more like hedge funds.\nAnd you know, one of the things that I've noticed in general about VCs in Crypto is that in general they're not looking for real businesses that can create GDP for the industry, that can create real value for the industry.\nThey're looking for hype machines that, you know, they can sell the token as quickly as possible and make some money.\nIt's hard for me to call that a VC, right?\nLike in our industry, we call them, they call themselves VCs, you know, etc.\nBut, you know, real venture capitalists that, you know, help support and build new industries and reap the rewards and benefits, what they do is they support great founders and great projects for the medium and long term, right?\nAnd when those projects win in a really big way, they win in a really big way, too.\nWe don't have enough of that in Crypto.\nIf we had more of that in Crypto, you know, I think we'd see more sustainability in the ecosystem.\nI do think the problem is is the fact that the the main goal is typically to get tokens as opposed to equity because I think the problem with a lot of tokens is partly due to the massively increasing number of tokens across the massively increasing number of blockchains.\nThere's so much dilution, it's just hard for tokens to to remain to to to keep their value or to increase their value in the long run.\nAnd then in particular, even with well very popular projects that might be very widely used and have very good reputation in Crypto, the token price doesn't necessarily reflect that because partly because, you know, if it's a if it's a arguably pointless governance token, it's not capturing any of the value of the success of the protocol.\nIt can go in a complete opposite direction to the actual growth of the protocol.\nSo in a way it's you're not necessarily aligned with the success of the project in a way that I think typically you are if you have equity.\nYeah, I I I I I would agree with you and you know, I think that there is a real opportunity amongst the other problems that we talked about that need to be fixed to ensure that token value is aligned with project value.\nRight?\nIt's a simple thing to say, but historically for regulatory reasons and other, right, it's been a really hard thing to do.\nAnd hopefully as we get more clarity in the regulatory landscape, we can start really aligning those two pieces for most projects better.\nAnd hopefully that'll help.\nAnd you're right.\nI mean, you know, when the pool is only so big, but you know, the number of tokens are increasing at such, you know, a massive rate on on almost a daily basis, it creates all kinds of issues, right?\nFrom that that impact the viability of even good projects.\nYeah, I definitely think once you get rewards revenue sharing starts becoming much more commonplace, I think it then becomes much more interesting in buying tokens that you think are associated with projects that you think are have really good fundamentals.\nAnd I think that becomes almost like the opposite of the memecoin cycle where you just, you know, whatever captures the attention spam of the moment, you know, very short-term trading.\nYou then suddenly actually, you know, start to think which which protocol is going to be here in 5 years time and how can I get a percentage of the fees it's going to make.\nUm, yeah, I think we start to see some people call it Fundamental Season.\nYeah, I I totally agree.\nWe believe very strongly that now is the time in Crypto for a flight to reality, for a flight to quality, for a flight to fundamentals.\nThat's I it's it's very connected to why Thrive Protocol exists and why I believe that we have grown as quickly as we've we've grown because we back projects with real fundamentals and we make sure that they're funded, you know, as they achieve real credible revenue milestones, TDL milestones, growth milestones that are supportive of the future of that project, of the ecosystems, you know, in which they are exist, testing and also Crypto as a whole.\nSomething I like to ask people, what Crypto platforms or or protocols have you been playing around with or experimenting with recently?\nYeah, I mean beyond Thrive.\nSo look within the Thrive ecosystem there's like so much cool stuff.\nI talked earlier about Zion.\nWe're working with Polygon and and with Hideera funding a bunch of stuff on, you know, on both of them.\nThere's a lot of preTGE stuff that we're going to be launching soon that we're really really excited about like you know Far Away is and and Fchain and you know be life which is a really interesting kind of Bitcoin layer 2 and you know and a bunch of others.\nI mean we've just ZK Verify which is a new ZK chain connected to kind of a sister of Horizon and and Zen.\nWe just think that there's so much really interesting stuff in the space that's that's happening right now.\nAnd it's been really interesting to be alongside it and to ask a deeper question which is like, you know, who are the great teams and builders and founders that can help build and support and, you know, and and help grow.\nFor sure.\nAnd what do you think will be the biggest trend of 2025?\nI think hope I hope we've nailed it together which is you know a flight to value to quality to GDP to great builders and founders and you know generally speaking to to people who are committed to building the future of Crypto we need it and now is the time.\nAmazing.\nAnd on that high note that's all we have for today.\nUh, I want to thank Daniel Jacobs for joining this episode.\nAnd as a reminder, a newsroom works tirelessly to get you accurate, informed Crypto news.\nIf you want to stay ahead, read the
