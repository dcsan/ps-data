  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHello and welcome to the Cryptobe. My name is Tim Copeland. I'm the head of growth at The Block. Joining me today, we have Robinson Burkey, co-founder of the Worhmhole Foundation. Welcome to the show. How's it going? Thanks for having me, Tim. It's going uh it's going quite well. Coming to you live from New York. We've got an exciting week here. Conference buzzing, a lot of people in town. So, uh yeah, things are going well. Awesome. Are you going to pop in to permissionless? I am. I am. We have uh I actually have a good uh fireside chat tomorrow with Jack Zamplin, the SVP of stablecoins at Ripple. We'll be talking about stablecoins, multi-chain adoption, all that good stuff. Amazing. Amazing. You going to be at ETC, too? I won't be at ECC. A lot of the Wormhole contributors will be though. Um we've got a few few events and a few things to announce as usual. Um but need to need to pace myself because there's always another conference right around the corner.\nThey just don't stop. All right. Well, before we get into it, just a quick note. If you're hiring in crypto, check out Campus out of all your candidates that help you pick out the real crypto natives. Head to the block.co/campus to get a 3-month free trial. Now, today's episode is about crypto going crosschain. So, Wormhole has seen a lot of growth in uh asset transfer volume, institutional integrations. What has been the main sort of driver behind this growth?\nYeah, I think so. If you think about maybe we take a four or five-year step back, uh we very much so viewed the world or or maybe the consensus, the thought main thought at the time was actually that everything was going to exist on one chain. Once upon a time in our journey of building Wormhole, that was kind of the school of thought we were up against. It was a lot of people that actually didn't believe that there was a need to connect multiple chains. They didn't believe that there would be multiple chains. Um it was a lot of specifically you know the everything will kind of settle to Ethereum and over the years we've kind of seen that slowly become evolve and and and become debunked. I think there was a period of time where it was like well there will be a fragmented multi-chain world but it'll still all settle to Ethereum. And then now I think we're we're very very much so in this period of time where all right there's going to be a lot of blockchains. Salana is, you know, arguably one of the more used and popular ones right now. It's not even kind of all the focused on Ethereum. Um, and there's other big ones like Sooie coming up, obviously, Monad, there's Barerchain, etc. Um, so now we're kind of to this world where it we are absolutely multi-chain. And so if you think about you're an application or you're a developer building something onchain, um, you are an asset, right? We we have a lot of stablecoins. you have a lot of institutions that issue something on chain. The the funny thing about blockchains is you're beholden to kind of the that ecosystem, right? The the users, the apps, the liquidity of that one ecosystem. So that could be Salana, that could be Ethereum. You're only accessing one. You're deploying your contracts or whatever your logic is, and you're accessing like just one. And so if you really want to be successful and you want to open up whatever application or business or asset you're you're developing on chain, the best way to to get the largest market uh is to build or issue across all of these chains. And so what we're kind of seeing is this this evolution of from over the past four or five years of you know block everything's going to be on one chain, there's not going to be multiple to there's multiple but it'll be on Ethereum. Now there's you know there's multiple and there are all different types of virtual machines and now we're starting to see more and more adoption especially institutional and they want to be on all the chains. I think like the last thing I'll say on this is um you know the concept onchain should mean all the chains like I think some blockchains base for instance and this you know we work closely with them this is just something they will say not an attack but they'll say onchain meaning base but I would push this a little further meaning onchain should just mean you're across all the chains or at least across some chains and I think we're starting to see kind of that critical uh adoption on specifically needing to be across all these chains if you want to be successful in building something on blockchain and are you seeing any growth in any particular chains recently in terms of like people moving assets to that chain? I was curious about Hyperlid like I know people are starting to build projects there if you're seeing sort of growth there. Yeah, absolutely. I think Hyperlid is the current darling or the new kid in a high school if you will not really new anymore but um they're definitely it's definitely that moment in time where we're seeing a lot of activity on Hyperlid. We actually are launching Hyperlquid um uh I believe in the next week and a half. Um so we'll start to p push a lot of flows towards Hyperlquid. Um but we we see still see a lot of flows on some of these like the main ones. And one thing I'll say too, Tim, is that there's a common misconception that like you I I sometimes I see like uh certain providers say 100 chains, 110 chains, and there's definitely that many, but the activity onchain activity is actually I think like 95% or something like that. And this is kind of a finger in the air number is across probably like the top 12 chains. It's very like 80/20. And so we see a lot of flows between Salana still uh you know arbitrum base sooie hyperlquid of course but it's kind of that it remains that kind of like top 10 almost how some people would think about like the coin market cap top 10 uh is kind of the same same with blockchain. Are you seeing much activity on on Siri like I'm starting to see people talk about a little bit more um recently but I haven't really like used the ecosystem that much. Yeah, I think when so what we kind of monitor is we look at flows between blockchains and um with Stewie in particular, we see a lot of flows there. I think they're probably we did like a 2024 wrapped um and it's kind of like when everyone was doing the Spotify wrap thing. Suie was our top Yeah. the third largest inflows of any chain. Um so meaning like users sending assets onto the chain to do you know something on the chain whatever it is it could be DeFi, it could be some sort of game etc. So just based on that and this is obviously was towards the end of last year. We still kind of seen seen the same behavior. We're definitely seeing inflows there. um what it exactly is it for you know is is a I think a more of an open question but I know Sue's recently launched a lot of homegrown protocols u walrus ebook etc that have have seen some success launch their own tokens and that's really when a when an ecosystem starts to hit that critical mass as well right like a blockchain launches its own tokens but when you go through that evolution of those the DeFi apps built on that blockchain also launching tokens it's this like positive flywheel um and Suie is kind of going through that moment right now. Salon obviously had that. Bar chain hasn't even gone through that, I would argue. Um, so I think it's it's definitely a good good time for SU. And are there any like crypto apps you've been sort of playing around with recently that you know you found quite interesting? So one thing I I've been focusing on a lot because this is a lot of uh where we found strong product market fit is um real world assets. We say real world assets, we say institutions. I think you know maybe what does that mean? Um, you know, a lot of it is is tokenizing securities today. A lot of it's money markets in particular. Um, I have recently, you know, taken a position with it with private credit. You know, we can maybe get into this in a little bit, but I think private credit on chain is like a meaningful use case that blockchain or tokenization can provide that, you know, you couldn't get with maybe in a traditional market. So I I token or I um tokenized some private credit and then I've I've just been toying around with what it the experience is to go from this KYC tokenization protocol. So we I did this via securitize. We work closely with them to then using it in a money market onchain. Um and so I kind of went through the end toend process of effectively just looping my position. Um they're doing this on Morpho on Polygon actually. Um, shout out to that team. And, uh, you know, it's obviously looping on a money market is nothing new, but I think just the the novelty or the using an actual RWA I thought was was something I wanted to try because I you don't actually see it that much, right? We talk a lot about tokenization and it's happening. I think tokenization AUM is probably around 30 or like TVL is probably like 30 billion on chain today. So, it's definitely gone up. Um, but seeing it in DeFi, I think, is still where that next kind of catalyst or next wave is happening. So, there's only a few select use cases for tokenization in DeFi today, actually. So, um, that that's that's mainly what I've been focused on. It's still pretty clunky process. Um, but it does ultimately work, but it's a lot of like manually someone's manually managing the position, etc. So, um, I've been focused a lot on that kind of the actual intersection of, you know, these like tokenized securities and using them in DeFi. And why would someone want to tokenize their credit? Like, what are the the advantages there? When it comes to the asset class of of private credit, it is an asset class that has been effectively, you know, I'm going to use some just in this use spirit of time, like I'm going to use some broad strokes, effectively been gated for very high net worth individuals. So it's an asset class if you wanted to invest in usually involves maybe some sort of lockup but in return you get some sort of higher higher yield of course you know riskadjusted etc etc but the way in which you get access to typically like a private credit investment uh you know some big big private credit uh funds are like Apollo Hamilton Lane believe KR has a has a big private credit fund too uh the way you kind of get access is first you you need some sort of like um broker right like man financial manager there there's usually minimum minimums involved there, right? So, you have first of all, you have to be able to get the financial advisor or the the what have you in order to be able to buy this this asset vehicle. So, there's lots of different minimums, lots of different requirements for all these different brokers, you know, but there is some sort of minimum, right? So, that all instantly gates some some people. And then to actually invest in the the the um asset vehicle itself, there's also a minimum there. Um a minimum could be it could be $500,000. I think that's actually like pretty pretty normal, right? And so then you you probably take out the majority of the population with that with that. And so when you think about bringing something on chain and being able to kind of fractionalize it um and have kind of these offer these secondary markets, more liquidity, etc. Uh you open up kind of the TAM of investor class can invest in this. And so I think we talk a lot about over the years with crypto like democratizing finance. I think it makes a lot of sense for stablecoins who've done a good job, right, where like exporting the power of the dollar to certain countries where people get paid something and the value of their money between paychecks goes down 15%. Like that's insane. So like there is a cool democratizing of finance happening with stablecoins. I don't think anyone's arguing with that at this point. But I think I think private credit's also interesting too because this investment that you know we always hear the terms the rich get richer. these investments that like these high net worth individuals have access to and maybe others don't. We kind of open up the TAM there. Um, and so, you know, you could buy Apollo private credit or or Hamilton Lane private credit I think is $10,000 now. So, we're going we went from a a broker and half a million dollars to $10,000. So, there's still a minimum, but like come on, that's gone down significantly. And so, that that to me is pretty exciting. Um, and I think kind of helps deliver on some of these like promises we talk about so much with with crypto and blockchain. Sure thing. And what is Wormhole doing in the tokenized uh equities or sort of you know realwa space? We are effectively moving all these assets between the chains. And why is that important? There's kind of two two reasons. Number one, what fund managers talking a little bit more specifically, we say institutions, a lot of them today are these these large fund managers. What they want is uh you know they want assets under under management to grow. So they want more people investing in the products and so they we the and this is the first bucket they actually view uh crypto now as an asset class right you have a lot of people that want to invest in things that are onchain or within this kind of crypto realm if you will and so when you think about let's say I'm a fund and I'm issuing on one blockchain I really like yes there's a lot of users that use multiple blockchains but there's you know it's still pretty sticky so if they're issuing on Salana they're only getting access to those user users or those investors as they view them. So they want like the 2.5 whatever trillion market cap market of crypto not the like what's beholden to one blockchain. So we help make sure that any asset issued on chain can be on multiple blockchains. There is like some nuance in the sense that like the blockchains have to be approved and certain things have to be deployed on the other ones but in general we're expanding the TAM for them so more people can invest. So you can buy Bidd let's say on Salana but you can also buy on Arbitum, Apttodos, Polygon, Ethereum etc. The second bucket is this kind of going back to this DeFi concept. So uh if you let's say hold the majority of your assets on Ethereum for whatever reason you have a multisig there etc. But we know that DeFi apps you know are different across multiple different blockchains. You know Athena's on Ethereum mainet um there's Dr\n\n\nAfter on.\n\nSalana.\nUm, you wanted to use one of these DeFi protocols.\nLet's say I had, I don't know, $50,000 worth of Bidd on Ethereum.\nI wanted to long my Bidd or use it as collateral.\nLet's say not long, use it as collateral on Drift on Salana.\nI could keep, let's say, 25,000 on Ethereum, and I could send 25,000 to Salana, and then I could take a position there.\nAnd this way, you're not like having to sell it on the secondary market for cash and then going and buying it on Salana and buying Biddle, etc.\nIt makes it, it makes the flow of funds much easier, reduces a lot of friction.\nBut what the behavior we typically see is using those assets within DeFi protocols.\nAnd it seems that institutional adoption seems to be quite a big role in your strategy.\nUm, so what's your, I guess, what's your main sort of strategy there in terms of finding success with the institutions?\nI think one thing that we always try to do at Wormhole is, one is, is try to be as intellectually honest as possible in a space that's kind of mired with, or that has a tendency to not be.\nAnd, um, I would say the second thing is, um, making sure that the, I would say, I'd say with, with, yeah, with institutions, we, we, we like to target the tokenization platforms today.\nUm, but I think what I was, what I was trying to say was, like, we like to target real use cases.\nUm, and so being honest about what those real use cases are, I think is something that is important to us.\nSo we, I think we went through this period in like 2020, 2021 where we talked a lot about institutions.\nYou guys, you probably remember this, Tim, where it was like, the institutions are coming, the institutions are coming.\nLo and behold, it actually didn't happen for a number of years after that.\nYou could argue that, like, FTX kind of set us back as an industry, and that's probably why.\nI think that's an acceptable argument.\nUm, but I think for us, we try to understand what is, what are the real use cases today and then target those.\nAnd the real use cases today are tokenizing kind of like pretty rudimentary asset vehicles.\nWe talked about money markets, we talked about private credit.\nUm, and so today the strategy is, you know, these tokenization platforms often act as like gatekeepers to the relationships of these institutions and also the way in which these institutions issue anything on chain.\nSo we've, we've done a lot of work, um, with our close partner Securitize, who's, who's, I would say, one of the leading tokenization platforms, and, um, you know, making sure that they have, they have good relationships with BlackRock, Apollo, etc.\nUm, and then anything that they're issuing on chain, Wormhole is being used.\nSo I would say that's kind of like one of the overarching strategies.\nUm, and then it's trying to figure out what actual value can a blockchain technology provide and being honest.\nYou can't, you can't fool these institutions, right?\nYou can't just be like, \"Oh, just do it.\nWe'll announce it.\nWe'll figure it out.\"\nLike, what actual tangible value can this technology provide and then going to them with these, with these use cases.\nAnd, um, you know, we have a few things in the work there around, you know, on the weekend in traditional markets.\nLet's say, uh, an institution gets, has cash, but they want to make interest over the weekend, but they, the market's closed, so they can't buy anything.\nLike, how do we kind of set up an arbitrage where they are able to kind of invest in the crypto market, get that interest over the weekend, uh, you know, something like that, right?\nLike, bringing these kind of like interesting use cases where 24/7 markets or fractionalization or like these, these various things that a blockchain tech can offer, like, actually benefits these, these institutions at mass.\nUm, so I would say our strategy, maybe just to summarize, is like, real use cases and being intellectually honest.\nLike, these, these institutions appreciate that.\nThey want tangible, here's, you know, the ROI, if you will.\nUm, and then the second thing is working with tokenization platforms.\nLike, that's still where we're at today, is still in this kind of like tokenization era.\nUm, it has been coming for a while, but it really never, nothing was happening until the past year, and now focusing on what it looks like to then bring those RWAs into DeFi, right?\nWe have 30 billion on chain, let's get that into some DeFi protocols.\nWould you say there's been a big difference in the openness and willingness of institutions to talk to crypto projects like Wormhole?\nLike, when did, like, did that change, when did it change, and sort of how, how much has it changed their, their approach?\nYeah, I, I would say absolutely.\nUm, I, I, I, I don't want to give all the credit to this, and I think that's kind of like a copout answer, but I do, I do think that we can't underestimate, like, the US in terms of, like, a with world capital markets is, is, is pretty big.\nAnd so I think a lot of these institutions kind of have a no BS approach to, they don't want to touch this unless there is some sort of regulatory clarity.\nSo I think a lot of them have started to get more comfortable.\nGood example of this is after the Genius Act was passed, I think JP Morgan, like, announced that they were going to do something with the stablecoin, right?\nIt's like, as soon as, as soon as there's clarity, these, these, I think these guys are going to start, start getting in in a big way, or they are starting to get in a big way.\nSo I, I, I think we've seen, um, a significantly bigger push since this kind of this clarity we had last November with the administration shift.\nI, I would say even before that, though, we kind of started to see, uh, more, for instance, BlackRock's obviously very involved with Securitize, you know, they're a large investor, so they're, they were thinking of a thoughtful approach of how do we take this, you know, uh, take advantage of this technology, but maybe not super directly, right?\nTo, like, working closely with, with another provider, um, that they're obviously on the cap table of.\nUm, so I, I, I think that we're starting to see, we're not even starting to see it, they're here, right?\nThey're the, the, the amount of banks and financial institutions that are tokenizing something, I, I, I'd be hard, you'd be hard pressed, let me say this, to find some that haven't announced or haven't announced something, like, they most have.\nAnd you could say, \"Okay, that's cool.\nThat was like 2021, 2022 as well.\"\nI think you'd be, you know, I think you could find a lot of them, but a lot, a lot of them have actually issued something on chain, right?\nSo like JP Morgan, um, has issued stuff on chain, BlackRock, Apollo, Hamilton Lane, KKR, Van, uh, you know, obviously there's, there's many, like, we have the Middle East cohort has as well.\nSo it's, it's, I think we're beyond they're coming to, we're to the point that they're here.\nUm, I think we're just at that point again where it's like, what does it look like to actually use this in DeFi and and really grow the pie?\nThat if you look at the RWA, and I kind of associate this with institutional adoption, RWA.xyz is a really good resource for this.\nIf you look at like RWAs on chain, it's just up and to the right, um, which I think is a good indicator of real adoption.\nAnd how do you think all of this plays out over the next 12 months?\nDo you think it's just more companies, more projects, they just keep expanding?\nI actually think there's, we're kind of going through a little bit of a potentially consolidation period, and maybe not when it comes to institutions, but I would say when it comes to crypto, to crypto protocols, to cryptonative companies, um, and also, you know, these larger institutions coming into the space, looking at, you know, what, what can they purchase?\nI think Stripe's a great example of, we could call them an institution, right?\nBut like, you know, whatever, they're, they're a non-cryptonative company that that has a lot of success in kind of the traditional market or tech space.\nUm, they've obviously made two large acquisitions.\nUm, and we've seen Ripple obviously make large acquisitions.\nUh, Hidden Road is was a huge one.\nUm, Coinbase is is is making some of these.\nSo like, I think when it comes to cryptonnative companies, we're going to actually see continue to see a lot of einate.\nUm, we're going to see, uh, cryptonative companies by cryptonative companies.\nAnd I think we're also going to see non-cryptonative companies buy cryptonative companies and and protocols potentially, like, what, you know, figuring out what that could potentially look like.\nSo I would say as I think about, um, kind of institutions coming in the space in the space or kind of non-cryptonative companies, I think M&A, that's it, is happening.\nI think it'll continue to happening at a faster clip.\nRight?\nIf you think about the cycle of any sort of M&A deal, it's long.\nYou're three months is best case scenario, six months is probably average for a deal cycle there, and then you know, probably some of them at last, you know, 12 months more, so like, there's, I thought this six months ago, but there's, there's a lag, so I think you'll even start seeing more, more kind of landing as time goes on.\nUm, and then the other thing is kind of back to what I've been saying is liquidity is king, right?\nAnd, um, I think that what institutions offer is just more liquidity than we can ever imagine our our crypto or DeFi native minds.\nUm, and so these protocols become more efficient typically with more liquidity.\nUm, offering something like Bidd's collateral to mint a stablecoin, that's big, right?\nBecause B is an asset could grow to billions, if not trillions.\nI mean, we're talking an asset manager that has 13.1 trillion under management.\nIt's not too crazy to think of that, right?\nUm, so I think those are kind of the two, two buckets.\nM&A, we'll definitely see more of it.\nWe already have, so it's not that hard to take.\nAnd then just more of these assets in DeFi.\nI'm starting to see it week over week, day over day, and actually helping some of the institutions figure out how that these assets can be utilized, um, within, within these protocols.\nM&A has definitely been quite a big trend.\nWhat do you think about, um, IPOs?\nLike, obviously, Circle has caused quite a big splash, and now I think we're going to see a lot of demand for other companies to IPO.\nAbsolutely.\nI, I think here's one thing crypto companies do a really good job of, and it's, it's chase narratives.\nSo let's just move, remove fundamentals for a second, right?\nUm, or the reasons why I think, well, not all the reasons, but one of the core ones I think is just that any sort of crypto company IPOing, Circle kind of kicked off this like beautiful window of success or likely success.\nSo, if you're thinking about, like, hey, what's a sort of net new, how can I get some capital within the company or like some sort of like net new motion to kind of, um, I don't know, get, get renewed eyeballs, get more capital, etc.\nAn IPO is probably a good, a good move, um, especially given Circle's, you know, just did that.\nAnd then also IPOs on chain.\nAnd I think a lot of people are talking about, um, some, some maybe some companies, like cryptonative companies that may be too small to, uh, actually IPO on a traditional market could be pretty interesting for them to just IPO, IPO onchain.\nUm, you know, it could be, uh, that could be media companies doing stuff like this.\nYou could see that.\nUm, I, I think it will be, in particular for me, I think that that, that is like an interesting, uh, company segment is like the ones that can't, maybe can't launch a token because they don't have utility for the token within a protocol.\nThey don't have a protocol potentially, but they're definitely cryptonative.\nUm, and I think like these, you know, media agencies are particularly in, uh, interesting there.\nI think, uh, tokenization platforms could be very interesting for that.\nUm, so I, I think we'll see some like onchain native IPOs, meaning like they don't, they don't, you know, IPO like Circle did, but I also think we'll see more companies try to go the Coinbase, Circle route, um, as well.\nCan you explain more what you mean by an onchain IPO?\nLike, is this like issuing like security tokens?\nExactly.\nExactly.\nJust doing that, issuing security tokens onchain.\nUm, because if you think about maybe the IPO process in the traditional sense, it's probably the like walled garden to making that happen is is probably a little too high for some of these like smaller small cap companies.\nBut maybe the process of launching something onchain or ipoing onchain, um, you know, via some sort of like tokenizing the securities, I think could be an interesting approach and open up like a window where these companies that couldn't IPO through this normal route can now, um, maybe we change the acronym, right?\nIt's not maybe it's not IPO on chain, but, um, yeah, I think I think that could be an interesting route.\nYeah, definitely, definitely curious idea.\nUh, Um, how's the Wormhole, um, governance, um, setup been going?\nWormhole took an interesting approach to governance.\nSo we launched our token a little over a year now, and we actually net new built, uh, we, we built a net new governance protocol.\nUm, and the idea was, we talked to a lot of, uh, governance protocols like Tally.\nUm, I think they're, they're like one of the biggest ones on Ethereum.\nI think they run most protocol governance.\nOne of the biggest issues they had was, as multi-chain becomes more of a thing, right?\nSo you have a native token, let's say for a protocol on Arbitrum, and people send it to all these different chains, you actually can't use it in governance when the token exists on that chain.\nUm, and so governance participation in crypto, I think governance in general is this area of crypto that needs a lot of work.\nUm, but one of the core problems is like, as you send these tokens to different chains, you can't use them in governance.\nSo like, we're already struggling with kind of governance being effective on chain.\nUm, and then you add this additional friction layer as multi-chain becomes more and more of a thing.\nTokens go everywhere.\nYou know how it introduces more friction.\nSo we said, hey, what if we built something because our native token is exists on all on all these different chains?\nSo what if we build something where you could vote from any chain?\nAnd so we built MultiGov with Tally, where effectively you can send your token to whatever chain, have it on there, use it in DeFi, etc.\nUh, and you could still vote with it on that chain.\nAnd this is all done in the either the w.wormhole.com or the tally.xyz Wormhole like governance tab.\nUm, so it took us a while, candid.\n\n\nLy, Tim, to launch governance, and that's because we rebuilt a lot of those core primitives, and we also rebuilt a lot of the governance stuff on Solana. It was a little bit clunky. It wasn't what we needed, and so we spent a lot of time rebuilding some of the core primitives for governance on Solana. So you could vote from EVM chains and Solana with multi-GV. So we rolled that out finally, I think a few months ago. But we're on our third proposal now. The proposal is kind of getting grants together.\n\nBut here's the thing is, maybe not to be too long-winded, but I have this thing about crypto going through its practical era. I think one of the, we're asking ourselves a few questions, right? One question is, how many validators do you really need to secure a network? Do you need to have thousands of permissionless validators across all these different geos? Can you have, you know, a hundred? Can you have 13 like Hyperlid? I actually don't know Hyperlquid's latest numbers, so don't quote me on it, but I know it's not a lot, right? We came from this world of like, you know, tribally arguing this, right? Like saying Solana was centralized. You look at Solana, and they have thousands of validators. And now we have protocols that are just like the darlings of crypto with 13. So I think that's one thing we're asking ourselves. And then the second thing I think we're asking ourselves is how is governance the best thing for these protocols? And I absolutely think you need governance. That's not what I'm saying. But I think like how decentralized is the question. I think a good example is Jupiter recently, right? Jupiter has been coming under a little bit of fire because they put stuff like who they're hiring, those decisions through the governance process. And look, I don't know exactly all the details. There's a lot to follow in crypto, but I do know that they're catching a lot of fire for that, right? It just slowing them down. The leaders were having to focus and argue with people in the forums, right? And so I think for when you think about Wormhole's governance, one thing that is really important for me is I want to be thoughtful, making sure that it's decentralized, just like our protocol is decentralized, but I don't want to slow down, you know, the development of the protocol. It's a competitive space, interoperability, and we need to be in a position where we can move fast and make decisions effectively in order to maintain our edge on the market.\n\nSo you don't think you'll ever be fully decentralized?\n\nNo, no, no. I'm not saying that at all. I think again, decentralization is a spectrum, unfortunately. Like, I was in DC recently and talking about this exact thing, decentralization, and I think some of the leading discussions are actually trying to answer what is decentralized. I think some, maybe some traditional definitions, you know, I'm going to botch this, but are loosely around like no one controls over 20% of a given decision or something like that, right? So, you could translate that into cryptonative speak to something like a five-party multi-IG is probably not okay or at the bare minimum of okay, right? You have five people, you know, that's maybe like each have 20% or something like that, right? So, so I think what I'm saying is I want to figure out what is sufficiently decentralized, but not so much so that we have a DAO that is lost in a quagmire of decision-making and doesn't act slowly, loses their edge on the market, right? That's what I'm worried about. So I think we'll be decentralized. I think we will be sufficiently decentralized. I don't know, you know, what exactly that will look like in the future, but if you go on, today we have a delegate system similar to Arbitrum, all these other blockchains. So like we are well on our way in terms of decentralization and decision-making. I think I'm just kind of being actively cautious about what sort of decisions go to the DAO because I've seen it time and time again slow things down, and I've even seen token holders want this, right? Token holders in a project want there to be some sort of autonomy with the core people who are focused on it 24/7, want them to have some sort of autonomy with decision-making to move faster and more efficiently. And again, I encourage folks to go to the Jupiter DAO. I don't think Jupiter by did anything wrong, by the way. I think they just had some learnings along the way with how much they decentralize and the decisions they probably push to token holders.\n\nDo you think with the sort of changing regulatory environment in the US, projects are less worried about the need to be or appear decentralized and that it's now sort of a bit less of a focus?\n\nIt's definitely given projects the opportunity to take a breath and think about what is best. We've kind of went from this era of sprinting to decentralization at all costs because people were literally scared. So you wanted to be able to sprint at the expense of, again, like you really have to think about the trade-offs. Like if you have, you know, you have to wait two weeks to make a decision versus making it in a day with a group of stakeholders who think about this all the time, like that's a significant business trade-off, and that's what effectively happens within decentralized governance. And so I think that it's given a lot of projects the opportunity to like at least take a beat and not, not their decision-making process isn't decentralization at all costs because if not, you know, I could get in some sort of trouble, right? I could be the centralized party controlling things. It's gone, it's gone from that maybe to like decentralization is important. It's more primitive to crypto, and we want, we want the protocol to be decentralized. We want governance to be decentralized, but we also want to win, and we want this protocol to be successful. And so maybe taking a little bit more time to understand what could be a more of a thoughtful governance process versus like, again, I really think we came from an era of just like sprinting to max centralization and then like having to pick up the pieces along the way. And I think we're even starting to see this kind of more thoughtful approach to, you know, all everyone. It's what's interesting, what I found, especially as going through this process myself, everyone in all the token holders, all people in crypto, the main thing they want from tokens is value accrual, but value accrual to flow back to the token that is still something that is largely gated today, right? There's really not that many examples on chain of projects that are doing it. A lot of them will do buybacks and burns because that will kind of bring value to the protocol. I've reviewed a lot of these, and it doesn't really help token price that much. And so a lot of them want buyback and then stream of revenue to these tokens. And so that's something that I think the regulatory shift could hopefully bring for token holders because I think it's this like weird thing where projects token holders are asking for it, projects know it, but they're way too scared still to do that because they don't want their token to be a security. They don't want to pay this dividend, etc. And so that's something that I'm hoping we, we definitely don't have regulatory clarity on right now. That's something I'm hoping we will soon. But that's that's also when we think about like this shift. I think people are kind of positioning themselves to be ready for that. We're starting to see a lot of projects that start are getting revenue. Revenue is now kind of like a narrative. You know, hey, we should get revenue, we should be, we should be revenue-generating companies, and then they're positioning themselves to like bring the revenue in, hold it in some sort of treasury, and then as soon as there's this polarity, I think we will really start to see flow to the tokens, and then the you'll see a separation in protocols even more. You'll see the ones that are actually making money and that money is flowing to tokens, and not right now. We're at this weird period where everyone's trying to figure out hacks like buybacks and burns. Yeah, that's great, but it's definitely just a narrative pump still. It's not long-term value accrual, and even the narrative pump is going away. I would argue I've seen a lot of people announce these buyback and burns and very short-lived success. So, I'm hoping, I'm, I think to answer your question, Tim, I definitely think this regulatory change has given protocol builders a break to figure out governance, and it's been good, and I think we, it's been needed. But I think we, if we want to figure out that value accrual and that flow to token holders, I think we need a little bit, a little bit more safety there.\n\nDo you think you could see Wormhole doing revenue share within the next 12 months?\n\nUh, we will be in the position to do it if it is okay to do that's what I can say absolutely. So, formal today has multiple ways in which it can, you know, value can be accrued, you could say, and we will have that value flowing to an on-chain treasury, and then as soon as we have clarity on what can be done, we, we, of course, token holders are the number one focus for us. So absolutely, and especially token holders that participate in the governance process. So yeah, is there quite a bit of pressure to do that given the sort of historical price performance? I think there's a lot of pressure in general to just have like a longer term, like to start showing revenue, right? I think, I think we're again, I'll maybe I'll go back to this like broad brand of practical era, right? Maybe the third kind of prong here is that as this industry matures, there's going to be more expected of these protocols. No longer, I think, well, in the very, I think in the next 12 months, it'll be much harder to like launch a token and survive off of the token. You'll have to have a meaningful business model. You'll have to create, have revenue, and be able to kind of create this like flywheel, right? This, this important, this ecosystem within your protocol. And so I think beyond, you know, anything token related or price related, I think it's just something that's the natural progression for a company going through this, the phase that Wormhole is at, the stage Wormhole is, and a lot of other protocols for that matter that have kind of been around, surviving off token, etc. So yeah, I think it's kind of this part of this practical, practical era for crypto.\n\nAnd where do you see Wormhole in the next in in sort of five years time connecting every asset, app, institution, AI agent, and user on-chain? I mean, that, that's like when we think about crypto, everyone talks about the UX needs to be better, blah, blah, blah, like interoperability side of me say blah, blah, blah, like people have been saying the UX, the UX, and it's just like these things get a little tiresome over time, but it's not that it's not true. You know, it's definitely not not great, but I think the interoperability is the one of the biggest unlocks for this like UX thing. You, you, we're going to see frontends and applications definitely dominate, and then Wormhole is the actual connectivity layer behind all that, right? So like, let's use Poly Market as an example. If Poly Market's on Polygon, but if I want to, let's say, you know, and I'm not saying this is live today, but like, let's say I want have USDT from Tron, but I just connect a wallet, it doesn't matter that I have USDT from Tron. I spend, I place a prediction for 100 USDT, but Poly Market says, hey, we're on Polygon, and we only accept 100 US or USDC on Polygon. Wormhole is the settlement for that for those stablecoins. So all that can happen seamlessly today. If you wanted to place a prediction on Poly Market, which I'm using an example because it's obviously one of the leading applications for crypto, you would literally have to bridge over, you know, your USDC from a certain chain to Polygon into Poly and swap it into Polygon USDC, and then you place your bet. It's, it's an awful, it would be an awful process, right? I think they've done a lot to make that better, by the way. But like the concept I'm showing is just like any asset, doesn't matter the wallet, you know, and and making sure all this is kind of connected in the background to provide a unified experience, like we are supporters of a Jupiter, supporters of a of Poly Market, etc. So it's just a more assets, more institutions, more users, more apps, all of this. We're the connectivity layer, making, making everything seem like one chain is the best way to put it.\n\nAll right, quite the vision. Um, that is all we have for today.
