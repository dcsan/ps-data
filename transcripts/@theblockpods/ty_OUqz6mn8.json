  "cleanText": "Free month, free trial. Now, today's episode is around crypto vaults. So, at its core, what is Veda?\n\nVeda is the largest DeFi vault platform. Um, so maybe we can start with what are vaults? Vaults are basically tools for abstraction, right? DeFi's all kinds of different protocols, bridges. Um, you know, even people who've been like working in DeFi for a long time sometimes find it hard to navigate. Vaults are basically a passive way for users to earn yield in DeFi. They abstract over all the complexity, all the bridging, and provide a simple interface where users can just deposit their assets and earn yield. And so it's really amendable to like mass distribution. In my view, vaults are the missing piece for taking DeFi mainstream. Veda is the leading vault provider, over three and a half billion in TVL. Um, we're we take a B2B approach. So we work with chains, asset issuers, protocols to allow them to build bespoke yield products for their users.\n\nSo how does that sort of work? As in, you build, like, you create a set of code, it works across maybe a certain number of chains, and you license people to like use that code. Is is that it?\n\nIt's it's a little more than that, right? So we have this um foundational building block, um, which is our set of smart contracts. We called it the boring vault. It's this new architecture that we built from the ground up. So a vault is just a deployment of the boring vault, which with a bunch of off-chain services that we provide as well, right? So things like APIs for users to be able to see what's going on, analytics, um, SDKs for front-end integration. So it's really a full suite of services all the way from smart contracts to actually data that users consume to see what's going on with their positions. We provide that whole stack to our partners.\n\nOkay. And how secure or how battle-tested would you say your smart contracts are?\n\nYeah. So, you know, just Veda canonical deployments hold three and a half billion in TVL. There's never been a security incident on one of our underlying smart contracts. I could say a lot about why vaults are arguably more secure than other kinds of DeFi primitives. The short answer for this is, if you take something like a DEX or a lending protocol, there's a million things you can do with it, right? You can compose different actions in different ways. Um, you know, there's weird things like flash loans. So there's just this very large surface area that it can be difficult to figure out, you know, how do I safeguard this? For vaults, it's super simple, right? There's two public functions: there's deposit and withdraw. So with that surface area, you can build a ton of safeguards into both the entry and the exit to prevent, um, you know, to mitigate, mitigate risk. Uh, so our contracts are pretty battle-tested at this point. We've been live for a little bit over a year. Again, over three and a half billion in TVL. Um, but there's also a ton of projects that have built on top of the boring vault standard. Uh, there's there's over a dozen protocols that have either forked the boring vault or, you know, are working with us to develop their own version of it. And, you know, this is I, I wouldn't be surprised if the boring vault is one of the most audited pieces of code in the world because we've done a bunch of audits ourselves, but every partner that we uses also does their own audit. So, there's just this compounding effect as more and more people adopt a standard for security of our of our smart contracts.\n\nDoes that mean there's a sort of potential, uh, I can't think of the word, but, uh, maybe like contagion risk in a way, like, let's say, like, if there was an issue with the core sort of smart contracts that could then apply to all of these vaults in one go potentially, right, if there was some like very critical fundamental logic error that affected all of the vaults? Um, one like very conscious design choice that we made is the core code is super simple. It's like a 100 lines of code. Like we built this with simplicity in mind. So it is very unlikely that the core vault itself has any logic error. Number one, again, it's very small surface area for code. So, um, you know, there's been a lot of eyeballs on this and users looking at it. But number two, the architecture is super modular. So it'd be pretty easy to like, you know, um, update and uh, just swap out the the the affected components if need be. Um, so I don't think it's a it's a major risk. Um, it's a very, very simple and modular architecture, which means that it's easy to upgrade if need be.\n\nOkay. And then you mentioned like complexities of exits. Uh, reports coming out that GMX may have just been hacked for around 35 to $40 million. Uh, we've just seen that, uh, we believe it's GMX, uh, team has sent an on-chain message offering a 10% white hat bounty and acknowledging the exploit. Uh, I haven't confirmed that myself. That's a real message, but, um, it does seem that, uh, it's quite likely that it's been hacked. Um, do you, do you have any thoughts on, uh, on that taking place?\n\nYeah, I mean, first of all, like, you know, my, my thoughts go out to to anyone who's who's like in the protocol, and, uh, hacks are just rough, and DeFi's matured a lot, but it's still just part of the game. Like, we still have protocols getting hacked almost every week. Um, I'm not super familiar with what the the hack is. It actually just came out today. So, like, you know, definitely going to dig into it, but, um, it's interesting because GMX has been around for a really long time, right? And historically, it's had a pretty strong track record. So, I'd have to assume that this was some new logic or new code that was introduced, but we'll, we'll just have to see. It's a, you know, it's a tough situation.\n\nYeah. And then the one thing that I sort of wondered about as it may be more of a closer parallel was, um, the Bybit hack that involved Safe. And now Safe is different, but also similarly, they focus on multi-sigs, um, trying to keep, you know, funds secure. It's not too dissimilar to vaults. Um, and then obviously that was the largest hack. I'd have to check, but I think so. Um, do things like that sort of scare you at how easy it is for something like that to get through, or is that just like a very different example because that's more of like a sort of custodial system?\n\nSo the important thing that the big lesson from the Safe hack is the smart contracts were totally fine, right? It's not that the Safe multi-sig accounts were compromised in any way at a smart contract level. Rather, the hackers got access to um Nosis' off-chain systems, right? And they were able to do this very, very targeted attack that modified data for a single target, right? In this case, it was Bybit. Um, so there's a ton of lessons there. Number one, it is terrifying, right? Like that that patience, the execution of the hack is something that I don't think we've seen in the past. Uh, they could have, you know, the exploers could have done this to any Safe account, right? They had access to those systems, but they were very patient. They were very targeted, and they just modified that one transaction and that one address. So it, I, I won't say it could have happened to anyone because there are things that you know, um, the Bybit team could have done to prevent it. Again, this type of exploit has never been seen before. So I'm sure Bybit was following kind of standard, standard practices and not maybe, you know, the exceptional practices that would be required to prevent this. But the lesson is that like off-chain systems, uh, can be compromised, period. Right? Like if the, if your smart contract system or your protocol has a failure point in an off-chain system, that is that should automatically be where you think hackers are going to go first, right? Um, and the the like design lesson here is build your smart contracts in a way that even if your off-chain systems are compromised, it does not lead to, you know, like loss of funds. That's that's kind of one design choice. And the other is it should really be easier for people to see what's going on, right? Like the transactions that they're signing, the things they're executing. Um, it's like, you know, blind signing is just this horrible thing that still is very prevalent in the space. Um, there hasn't been a solution to it yet, but I'm I think there's a lot of teams that are working on it.\n\nYeah. What's the hardest part about making crypto vaults?\n\nI'd say obviously security is really important. Um, this is just true of any DeFi protocol. Um, you need a security-first mentality, but practically, um, so that's just like a prerequisite, right? You cannot have a successful vault if it's not secure, but growing a vault business, I'd say it's the challenges emerge with scale, right? It's super easy to have a single vault on a couple million dollars of TVL, but two forms of scale proof, like, you know, create new challenges. One is capital, right? Um, just practically, it's like, how do you earn yield on a billion dollars and how do you provide yield that is is more attractive and you risk-adjusted? There's that whole practical consideration. Um, and then the second point of scale is, can you, how do you support thousands of vaults, right? Um, there's there's operational overhead. There's, you know, all kinds of standard, um, let's say, like, software design questions. So that has proven to be the hardest thing. I don't think there is a vault provider that's operating at the same scale. And there's definitely a lot of lessons that we've learned as we've gone. So I do think it provides a competitive advantage to be in the market at scale for this long.\n\nYeah, now DeFi summer feels quite a long time ago. Uh, I'm sure many people in the industry now maybe weren't even around, uh, for DeFi summer. It was a very different age where you had thousand percent APYs and it seemed normal. Um, but would you say we're in a better position now to make DeFi more widely accessible than we were then?\n\nYeah, definitely. I mean, DeFi summer is a is a time that is very dear to my heart. Like, I, it, it was one of the most fun times to be in the space. Obviously, a lot of people also lost a lot of money. I think those like thousand percent APRs and just the crazy yield opportunities was really a function of risk back then, right? The risk back a couple years ago was so much greater because we hadn't settled on like standard practices for smart contracts. We didn't know what kind of designs would work. There weren't really protocols that um had been battle-tested in production for years at a time. So to incentivize people to like take risk on these systems, put their skin in the game, you basically needed to to provide high incentives. Um, we are currently in like the opposite side of the spectrum in DeFi. I think DeFi has matured significantly. Yields have definitely compressed, but there are a handful of protocols now that are battle-tested. They've been operating with billions in in TVL and volume for several years now. And I think for the first time ever, we are now in a position where we can actually take these protocols and export them to the masses, right? A couple years ago, it was not possible. It wouldn't make sense for any major fintech to actually offer DeFi products to their users because it's just too risky, right? But that's not the case today, right? You have protocols like Aave that have $40 billion in deposits, and that is a scale that is on par with some of these fintechs. Um, Uniswap, right, been operating for a very long time, no um, security issues. So I think for the first time ever, DeFi is actually in its consumer adoption phase, institutional adoption phase, and it's it's probably the best time to be building in DeFi ever.\n\nAnd are you seeing apps that are offering crypto products in a seamless way to consumers?\n\nMany of the um most successful DeFi apps today are doing this. Um, Ether.fi is a great example, right? Ether.fi was actually our first partner when we launched Veda, and they have done a great job of utilizing our technology to build products that are used by, you know, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. Um, so Ether.fi's liquid product line, one of the most successful of all product lines in the space. There's over a billion dollars of capital across ETH, BTC, USD. Um, you know, we also work closely with partners like Lombard, um, Plasma. We we had this crazy um pre-deposit campaign that we supported Plasma for that did a billion dollars in TVL in 30 minutes. Craziest launch I've ever seen. Um, so it's been widely adopted within DeFi. I think that's on it's not debatable. But we are increasingly seeing people outside of DeFi, right? And who are adjacent, like wallets, centralized exchanges, and fintechs, all becoming very interested in vaults. And you know, if it's not already clear, over the next couple months, we will see some some of these platforms actually deeply integrate vaults directly into their UX. We're already seeing it with wallets. Um, centralized exchanges are coming, coming very soon, and FinTech will inevitably follow.\n\nDo, do you have an Ether.fi card? I, I've seen there's a lot more sort of crypto cards coming out there and becoming a lot more competitive.\n\nYeah, I, I do have an Ether.fi card. Um, and or well, you know, our company has one, and it's uh, it's a great product, right? It's like built for DG, built for DeFi people. Uh, you get to earn, you know, like seven, eight% on ETH, and you don't have to sell it. You can borrow against it. Same with Bitcoin. So I think it's a great product.\n\nYeah. And I noticed you're powering a BTC vault. How does that work in terms of uh, providing for DeFi on Bitcoin?\n\nYeah. So I'm not sure if you remember, but like BTCI was this very, very exciting prospect, you know, probably six months ago, right? A lot of that was led by Babylon, and I still think Babylon is a really exciting project and all the downstream ones. Um, we're really close with Lombard. They're they're a great team, and um, they have a massive scope of vision. Um, so there's there's aspects of BTCI that have not been proven out yet. I think one of those is like where does the organic yield come from, right? Um, you know, what a lot of people are doing now is basically issuing staking rewards. So it's like inflation-based token emissions that provide yield on Bitcoin. Eventually that will need to become sustainable, right? But on the\n\n\nOn the other hand, there has been one very scalable structural use case for Bitcoin and DeFi, which is Bitcoin-backed loans, right? If you look at, you know, where Bitcoin is sitting on chain, most of it is sitting in lending protocols, and most of what people are doing are borrowing stables to go and spend or to deploy into some higher-yielding strategy. Um, you know, bringing this back to FinTech, this was kind of the first major DeFi mullet or like DeFi integration into a consumer channel that has millions of users, which was Coinbase integrating Morpho with Bitcoin-backed loans. Massive integration, you know, it's called the DeFi mallet. Um, there's tens of thousands of users that are through Coinbase just depositing Bitcoin on chain, borrowing staples against it, and going and doing things with it. Um, so that has interestingly proved to be this very, very successful use case not just for like financing, but if you look at the stable coin yield environment, take protocols like Maple, which have seen like really great growth recently. A lot of their secret sauce and alpha and providing yield is basically lending out stables against Bitcoin that's held in custody, right? And because they can offer fixed-rate loans, you can get like 6% on stables, which is very difficult to get onchain or offchain. Um, so Bitcoin is definitely, you know, been integrated in DeFi like BTCI is here. It's not as sexy and like, you know, high-yielding as people thought, but there's core structural uses that are in the billions already, and I think we'll see more of that.\n\nYeah. And um, you touched on this, but in what ways are institutions getting involved in DeFi? I mean, you mentioned more and Coinbase, but do you see anything more than that?\n\nYeah. So there's this interesting phenomena where today most of the capital in DeFi is actually arguably institutional capital, right? It's not just people with their with their PA um doing stuff. There are a lot of users doing that in the hundreds of thousands, probably, um, but it's mostly liquid funds, right? And institutions that are willing to take a little more risk, but to get to like proper institutional adoption where it's, you know, the suits on Wall Street, that is going to take a couple years in my opinion, but I think before that we will see fintech adoption, right? Like the people who are technology first see the virtues of DeFi and have to compete aggressively to offer the best products like centralized exchanges, like fintex, they are integrating that today. So, it's a little bit more retail is what I would say is the next kind of wave of adoption, but institutions are very interested in this. We're clearly seeing um seeing that move onchain through RWAs and other channels.\n\nYeah. And what what institutions are you currently working with?\n\nUm, you know, we have a lot of LPS. Uh, we have 100,000 users across all our products. Um, many of them are institutional. There's definitely a TVL power law. Um, without sharing too much about who they are, these are, you know, traditional financial institutions, DeFi funds, high net worth individuals. So, there's a lot of people using DeFi. Right now, we're not at the point yet where someone like a Fidelity or JP Morgan is actually going to offer a D5 product, but um, we'll get there soon, right? And we're definitely seeing interest from the from that caliber of company.\n\nAnd how do you think vaults will be used by traditional finance companies?\n\nSo there's, you know, there's obviously a ton of use cases here, right? If you think of vaults as the DeFi equivalent to like a fund vehicle, um, you can do things like baskets of DeFi yields that are offered to your clients. Um, RWAS are this big thing, right? As they move on chain, there's demand for higher yield, higher leverage strategies. So, you know, leverage loop strategies on RWAS. We're going to see those roll out. There's already a number of those that are out. Um, so yeah, I just think, you know, vaults are this tool for capital aggregation just like funds are, except they're better. They're cheaper. They're more transparent. They have checks and balances. So, vaults will become the primary way that capital is deployed and optimized. That's that's our thesis. Um, and there's going to be a number of use cases for that.\n\nWhat do you think of uh Robin Hood getting into tokenized stocks?\n\nYeah, I think it's huge. I know there's, you know, there's been some like it's a bit controversial on the execution. Probably a little bit of the advertising was um confusing to people, right? Given that this doesn't actually give you ownership over the stock and the same rights that holding a stock would, but I mean I think it is directionally very, very interesting, especially the aspect of offering exposure to um private companies, right? Like this is just a net net new functionality that does not exist or has not been accessible in traditional markets. Um, yeah, huge. I mean it's also really strong signal, right? Like Robin Hood is not going to stop here. They're going to keep going. Um, they there will be DeFi on the Robin Hood chain. So it could not be more bullish for the industry to have, you know, a company of that caliber that's that's very DeFi forward.\n\nYeah, it's definitely interesting to see the competition between these big exchanges, Coinbase, Kraken, Robin Hood, and that they all have their own chain, and now it's changing the sort of competition between them from being sort of straightforward competition for exchange volume and users to can they get everyone building on their chain, can they get an ecosystem there, a community there, and then make money through validator fees. Um, how do you think the lands do you think the landscape has changed quite significantly and you think that is now the real like point of competition between them?\n\nI would probably push back on the idea that you know ecosystem building is the primary factor that differentiates. Like the reality is these guys have massive distribution, right? And they they don't need to cultivate like a super novel or unique ecosystem. If you look at Bass, right, most of the usage on Bass is not on apps that are exclusive to Bass or novel on Bass, right? It's just what Coinbase has done is provided this really tightly vertically integrated experience from you go onto the exchange and in one click your assets move on to base and you're you're either earning yield or you're financing or whatever. Um, so yeah, I think there is an ecosystem curation aspect, which is you don't want a bunch of shitty protocols that are populating your chain and that's all that's there. You want high-quality protocols, but I don't imagine that they will take a ton of risk, right? In contrast, you could look at like a mega mega's ecosystem is totally unique, right? It's the protocols that are launching on Mega ETH only live there. And so, they've taken the opposite bet, right? They don't want to be a general-purpose chain. Um, they don't have a ton of distribution users yet, but their bet is like, we're going to provide a novel experience that you can only get on our chain. So, the users will come, right? Coinbase and Robin Hood aren't there. They have millions of users, they don't want to take risk uh where they can avoid it. But, you know, there's pretty low-hanging fruit like you offer lending, you offer yield, you offer borrowing. Um, and this is net new functionality that users have not, you know, their users have not been able to access before. Um, so yeah, that's kind of my take.\n\nOkay. And then most exchanges seem to be focused primarily on staking as sort of yield options. Some of them have lending. Um, why should people use vaults instead of going for staking rewards?\n\nFirst off, staking is um the staking yields are coming down, right? That's just that's just the reality. Um, and you know, if you think of staking as the risk-free rate, there's always demand for a little bit more, right? Um, staking yields are compressing. There's more you can do if you go beyond staking. So, I think it's just as an exchange, you want to offer products for the whole spectrum, right? And probably if people are using an exchange, they're not like the most risk-averse people in the world, right? That it's not like I just want to stake my ET and not do anything with it or stake whatever asset. They want they want to do things with it. They want to earn higher yield. They want to express their preferences. Um, so vaults are really a general-purpose tool to do that. Staking is definitely the gateway drug. Um, you know, this is uh this is like how you get people comfortable with yield, and definitely liquid staking is a really interesting portal into DeFi, but it's just inevitable, and we're already seeing it, right? That people want more than just staking.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd thoughts um have you previously in the past they've offered quite high APYs, what sort of APIs can people sort of expect right now?\n\nWell, there's a huge spectrum, right? Um, again, we our our vision is like a vault for everyone, so if you want just low-risk lending, you know, on stable coins, that's like four 4ish% onchain. Um, there's vaults for you, right? If you want strategies that take leverage and maybe have exposure to basis trades like Edena, you know, you could probably get eight or 9%, maybe even 10%. Um, ETH, similarly, right? There's there's strategies all the way from three 3 to 4% which is staking all the way to 10% which is doing things like taking leverage. Um, so we have a huge product diversity at this point. We have dozens of vaults in production. Um, you know, we have over like we have like around 10 vaults that have 100 million in TVL, which I think is uh is very unique, right? Any single vault reaching that is very difficult. We've been able to reproduce that again and again.\n\nAnd do the votes tend to be managed strategies or passive ones?\n\nUm, so there's again this is a mix, right? Um, there's vaults that are effectively LRTs, um, that don't do anything, right? They just stake, and under the hood they're they're doing restaking or whatever. Then there are vaults that are doing more interesting things like liquidity provisioning, lending, taking leverage. Um, we want to be agnostic, right? We are a technology provider. We want to support all kinds of strategies. It really depends on the goals as a protocol. I can tell you that the more active strategies, active products tend to have higher margins and are better for monetization, but the more passive ones, um, you know, they there's there's advantages to those as well. So, yeah, basically there's it's all of the above.\n\nOkay. Okay. Are there any platforms offering DeFi indices yet or DeFi indexes?\n\nUm, so do you mean like, you know, ETF style style products or uh indexes of DeFi tokens or or any of that?\n\nLike baskets of DeFi tokens.\n\nYeah. Um, you know, we've tried this in the past actually. A couple years ago, we uh our team built some of these products and nobody gave a Nobody wanted to use these things. Uh, and I think there's a core reason for this, right? Like index products have just historically always failed. And the reason is that DeFi people in DeFi have very, very strong opinions, right? It's like you very rarely find a person who is like ETH is the best, but you know, I want some exposure to soul as well, right? It's usually one or the other. It's like we love ETH, we love soul, and so that that also is the same case for different DeFi projects. Um, so so far just because the user profile is more sophisticated, very opinionated, we haven't seen D5 indexes be successful, but again with the Robin Hoods and Coinbase is moving on chain. I think this is a new user base that will be interested in these products. So, it's something we're keeping an eye on even though we we don't have any of those in production today.\n\nAnd are you starting to see any vaults that are using AI in some way, whether that's for the in terms of like running the strategies?\n\nWe are seeing a lot of projects try to do this. Um, my personal opinion is that it's too early, right? Like I don't know about you, but I personally would not trust my my own account to an AI. I think it would probably something up. Um, but it is definitely the future. Right now, the hard part is not actually the algorithm side. Like the models are going to keep getting better and we'll get there. The hard part is how do you build a capital base that actually trusts you, right? And you can retain. So, I think the successful way to do this, which is our approach at Veda, is build that capital base, right, and progressively integrate AI models into the optimization side of things as they get better and more reliable with human safeguards, right? Versus the opposite approach of like day one today, you know, we have these autonomous agents that perform decently for 95% of the time, but 5% they do something completely stupid and lose your money. Um, so yeah, we'll see it happen. Um, it's going to happen inevitably, but I think it's too early. And these projects claiming that they have these solutions are um, I'm I'm pretty skeptical of them.\n\nMakes sense. Yeah. I actually moderated an AI panel recently and I asked for any legitimate products that weren't snake oil and uh didn't get many names, so it wasn't it wasn't a great sign. Um, cool.\n\nAnd then finally, so what are you working on over the next 6 to 12 months?\n\nYeah, there's a lot of exciting stuff coming out down the line. Um, first is just access to more chains. Um, so I think we've announced this in the past, but we're launching on Salana very soon. So that's pretty exciting. Um, just our goal of supporting all the possible chains and making that accessible to users. We're going to continue doing that. But on this path of like exchanges and fintexs, uh this is we will have some exciting news um that should come down the line soon. So new products, new distribution channels, new partners. Um, yeah, there's there's a lot cooking on the beta side.\n\nSounds exciting. Well, that's all we have for today. Want to thank Sun Raghupathi for joining this episode.
