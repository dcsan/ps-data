  "cleanText": "Today we have Upexi CEO Alan Marshall and Chief Strategy Officer Brian Rudik.\n\nWelcome to the show.\nHow are you all doing?\n\nDoing well, Tim.\nThanks for having uh myself and Brian today.\nYeah, thank you very much.\nBrilliant.\nNow before we get started, quick note.\nIf you are hiring crypto, you should check out Campus out of all of your candidates.\nIt will help you pick out the real crypto natives.\nHead to theblock.co/campus to get a three-month free trial.\nNow, today's episode is about crypto treasury strategies.\nThis is something I've been noticing has been a growing trend recently, and I think some people are starting to get a little bit concerned if it's getting a bit out of hand.\nUm, so I'm going to grill you guys a little bit about this, and maybe you can put me at ease.\nUm, so just to begin with, what made you choose Solana for the Treasury play?\n\nHi, Brian.\nBrian.\nYeah.\nSo for us it was a pretty easy decision.\nUm I look at Bitcoin as the best monetary asset and Solana as the best high-performance blockchain.\nUm there are obviously 20 or more um micro strategy imposters.\nWe didn't want to be the 21st.\nUm we'd rather be the canonical Solana treasury company.\nAnd then the second thing is Bitcoin is a $2 trillion dollar asset.\nSo it is literally the seventh largest in the world.\nIt is unlikely to 5x anytime soon versus Solana, which is literally 4% the market cap of Bitcoin.\nUm it could 5x year end, and so for us it just made a lot of sense to be underpinned by the leading high-performance blockchain.\nTo get into a couple uh details around that.\nSo Solana, in my opinion, is like the first second-gen blockchain.\nSo it has a lot of big innovations over something like Ethereum, and I think you're seeing that emanate in best-in-class performance.\nUh and then lastly, that is attracting this large and growing ecosystem of users, developers, and DApps.\nSo you're seeing like Solana put up the best metrics out of any chain uh even at uh a smaller market cap than some others.\nSo uh yeah, for us it was pretty easy.\nWe see Solana as uh an endgame winner for high-performance blockchains and also as an asset for a public for a public company.\nYou know, the staking revenue adds another another kind of tier of of profitability for us.\nSo that was one of the other kind of like things that that really pushed us towards like Upexi.\nAfter speaking with Brian about that is that that was what why was the final decision on that being that having adding that to our um repertoire of revenue possibilities and growth.\nYeah.\nHow how does the staking revenue work if it's locked Solana?\nDo you still get the staking rewards and you can sell them or are they locked in accordance with the vesting schedule?\nUh the staking revenue is still paid uh well it's still earned u and it and it it unlocks uh whatever the linear schedule is, whether it's 20 months, 30 months, 36 months.\nSo every month it unlocks and then we move that from locked into into a liquid position monthly.\nYeah, just to double click on that.\nSo we have a lot of value accrual mechanisms that all compound and our ability to access lock at a discount is one of them.\nUm, most individuals actually can't get that, but we can.\nUh, and then when we do buy lock sold at this 15 to 20% discount, those are built-in gains for shareholders.\nIf you put this discount on any sort of yield equivalent metric, um, we are roughly doubling the staking yield and we're doing it in this risk prudent fashion.\nUm, lock actually does have a fairly liquid OTC market.\nSo, we could sell it if we want, but like we have pledged never to sell our soul.\nUh we're a buy and huddle only strategy.\nSo buying lock at this discount, given that we're not going to sell it, really aligns with our strategy and then provides for those gains for shareholders.\n\nAnd in terms of like where you got it from, is this uh ultimately from the sort of pool of locker from the FTX estate that was sort of sold to a bunch of you know firms over like the last year?\nThat that's one of many sources of it.\nUm they're there ultimately other sources of it, but so we so we buy from all from all sources.\nAnd one thing that differentiates us, so we're backed by 15 leading crypto VCs, a lot of them own a lot of this uh and so we're working with them and different brokers uh to where like they could easily drum up and we we do feel that we have better access to lock soul than others might.\n\nOkay, and where do you see Solana's adoption in the next sort of, you know, one to three years and how does that impact your long-term strategy?\nI'm super excited for the next three years.\nUm, in my mind, the biggest thing always holding crypto back in general were unclear rules and regulations in the US.\nI think we could actually be on the precipice of the mother of all bull markets because hopefully, fingers crossed, we will get digital asset legislation in the US next year.\nAnd the reason why this is so important is if this happens, institutions will have to jump in in a big way.\nUm, it's a little antithetical to like crypto, but is actually these big institutions that have literally billions of customers, billions of dollars to throw at it, a lot of the top devs, and built-in trust.\nAnd so if you can imagine something like Google Chrome adding a built-in crypto wallet and then Amazon accepting USDC payments, like we will just on board the masses.\nAnd so I actually think like we could be on the precipice of this step change function in usage and adoption and Upexi and Solana will be big benefactors of that.\n\nAnd is your Solana strategy more compelling since there isn't an ETF for it where there sort of obviously is for Bitcoin and Ethereum because it's sort of harder for especially traditional companies to get exposure?\nI think that's both in both.\nOne is right now today, you know, it's a it's it's pure access to to owning Solana directly.\nAlso, because of the with the way treasury companies trade at NAV, like anticipating that future growth and that staking revenue, people can make a multiple on on their, you know, investment possibly, you know, historically on way on where these trade.\nUm, but we welcome an ETF.\nThe more exposure for Solana and the more holders and the more you know it becomes more mainstream, it's just better for the underlying asset itself.\nSo we think we think having an ETF is going to be you know even more beneficial for us and for companies in the future.\nI'll just double click with an example if it's okay.\nSo BlackRock filed in mid-2023 for a Bitcoin ETF.\nUm Bitcoin was roughly at 25K and then by the time it went live in January of the next year, Bitcoin was in the 45 to 50K range and then you saw really strong flows and it pushed it up to 70K.\nSo you had Bitcoin more than double due to an ETF and you saw MicroStrategy perform exceptionally well over that time.\nUm so I am actually looking at uh spot Solana ETF as really good for us uh and for Solana as a whole.\nSo, um, we're excited about this, uh, and looking at it squarely as a big positive catalyst.\n\nAnd how long do you think until we see a SOL ETF?\nSpeculation.\nWe I mean, I think a lot of people thought,\nuh, we may have just lost Alan.\nI think you're back.\nYeah, I think I I I'm traveling today, so I'm in New York.\nSaying that the uh network but um I lost our our train of thought there.\nSorry about that.\nUm sometime this year I would hope, but I think that the staking revenue is actually causing a little issue is what I heard is that how them figuring out how to how to stake it is causing a little bit of an issue.\nI've seen a lot of ETF experts saying, you know, we're in the 90% range for getting one this year.\nUh there was just some headlines out uh two days ago basically saying that it could happen this month.\nSo, we're hopeful that it will happen sooner rather than later, but just like Alan said, it's a bit TBD.\n\nOkay.\nAnd why did you decide to adopt a treasury strategy?\nOne of the, you know, changes, you know, we added, we added the treasury strategy to our business because as we watched over the years the the value MicroStrategy creates it.\nWe were trying to figure ways to to to bring Upexi into, you know, its next its next stage.\nAnd when we were looking at raising capital and doing something, you know, creative, we were we were wa we decided on some sort of treasury strategy and looking at the the value that was created by MicroStrategy over the years and then us having to meet with GSR and then Brian and and we, you know, what we learned in that relationship was just the value of of how it was created.\nAnd I can let Brian get into, you know, more how the value was created with MicroStrategies, but really that was what kind of led Upexi into entering the new strategy.\nYeah.\nUm, what I'd say is there I mean digital asset treasury companies when done right can just create an enormous amount of value and might be the best way to invest in a digital asset for a lot of different investors.\nAnd so I will back up and I will say that I spent most of my career on Wall Street.\nI was managing a book of bank stocks always in a long short construct for Citadel, Millennium, and Balesnney.\nAnd the reason why that's important is these are just banks.\nAnd so like if you think about it, a bank will take a deposit, make a loan, they earn the spread between the yield on the loan and the cost of deposits.\nWe're the exact same way.\nWe raise funds from the capital markets.\nWe invest in Solana and then we earn the return between uh or the spread between the return on Solana and our cost of capital.\nAnd so uh I think that plus the fact that knowing that when you issue equity above book value it is by definition accretive enabled me to really internalize where all this value creation emanates from.\nAnd so we just basically employing that same model.\nUm we're following what MicroStrategy has done and actually trying to improve on it.\nSo, like Allan mentioned, we are staking our soul and we're turning our treasury into this productive asset rather than letting it sit there idle.\nWe are buying locked soul uh at a discount for built-in gains for shareholders.\nAnd then the whole capital markets flywheel where in my opinion most of this magic actually emanates from.\nIt's almost tantamount to capital markets arbitrage.\nI can get into the math and explain this in much more detail, but when the market awards us a premium to the underlying value of our digital assets, we can actually monetize that for the benefit of shareholders.\nAnd so, uh, yeah, it really is for all the value creation that we can do, which is what caused us to really push on this and and move into it in a big way.\n\nWhy should there be a premium on in these sorts of cases or or why is there?\nIn my mind, it really emanates for three reasons.\nOne is just the market wants access to crypto in the form of a familiar equity security.\nUh they essentially want to buy soul in their Schwab account.\nYou saw this with Grayscale's closed-end trust G Soul where before it filed to convert to an ETF it was rough it was routinely trading at a 500% plus premium.\nUm I also think that this emanates from uh access to these different value accrual mechanisms that you otherwise wouldn't get.\nUh and for example this is like our ability to buy lock at a discount.\nAnd then the last reason is just putting my bank investor hat on.\nGoing right back to that example of us earning the spread between the return on soul and our cost of capital.\nUh essentially we earn that spread not just this year but in future years as well.\nAnd so when the market expects us or Solana to have strong future returns that spread is quite positive and they will present value that add it to the NAV and that's where that that premium emanates from.\nUm yeah and then we can like I mentioned monetize that for shareholders.\n\nWell in the case of like strategy you can already get exposure through you know through the bitcoin ETFs.\nWhy therefore is there sort of a premium if it's allowing access that you know the idea is that it allows access that you don't have otherwise in strategy's case you do have access to bitcoin.\nSo so why does the premium exist there?\nThis comes from a lot of the intelligent capital markets issuance.\nYou can actually get into this capital markets flywheel.\nSo let's start with the premise that folks are willing to ascribe this premium to MicroStrategy.\nI'll use them as an example.\nLet's just say they trade it two times.\nUm then what MicroStrategy will do is it will go out and it will raise equity at two times.\nAnd when you raise equity at two times book, you are essentially selling a dollar for two or it's tantamount to buying Bitcoin half off.\nAnd so what that results in is your Bitcoin per share moving up and then if your Bitcoin per share moves up, your stock should move up accordingly and that helps you maintain that premium multiple and then the cycle will just continue.\nSo essentially if you buy into MicroStrategy uh at like a two times multiple you are buying half a Bitcoin, but if you expect them to continue to compound that Bitcoin per share you're actually will be better off over time.\nAnd so that's basically the way that it works.\nWhat I'd say is like MicroStrategy increased Bitcoin per share 74% last year.\nAnd so as long as you continue to expect them to be able to do this intelligent capital issuance and increase Bitcoin per share, even though you're buying in at this premium to underlying book, you will soon be better off if that comes if they continue to do that.\n\nOkay.\nSo people sort of buy in on the expectation that they sort of think a greater fall at some point is is going to come in later.\nUm and it just sort of keeps going until essentially you run out of sort of new people coming in.\nNot that not a greater fool really because a lot of this like the biggest thing that will determine MicroStrategy's success or our success is like the performance of the underlying token.\nUh, which is why it's super important to make sure if you do invest in a digital asset treasury company that you're doing one that is underpinned by a token that you think will not only be around in five years, but will continue to outperform and can be an endgame winner.\nUm but I think a lot of this just emanates from these strong views on forward uh Solana returns or Bitcoin returns and then uh the companies being able to monetize that for shareholders and with and with Solana I think people are not only anticipating the growth of the the price of Solana they're also on Wall Street they're able to add in and you know forward look at that that yielding uh of the st\n\n\naking revenue.\nSo that's one of the other reasons, like, that was what we talked about earlier.\nWe think that's a differentiator for us than, than even from Bitcoin, even though Bitcoin, you know, is obviously the premium asset for digital, but we think that gives Solana treasury company a little bit of an advantage.\nOkay.\nAnd what would happen in this situation, uh, where, like, Solana, the price of Solana to drop 96% again, like it did a few years ago?\nLike, what happens in that situation?\nSo, it depends on the company.\nYeah.\nGo ahead, Brian.\nIt's a big speculation, but yeah.\nSo, one, what I would say is, um, I think, like, a lot of these black swan events, um, are now probably over with, um, for Solana.\nSo, obviously, like, FTX was very well tied into Solana.\nI don't think, like, there is that vector anymore, obviously.\nUm, and, like, I was mentioning, I actually think when looking at positive catalysts and putting things on a risk-reward basis, there's many more things that could go right than could go wrong.\nUm, but what I'd say is, like, it's also really important for investors to actually look at each company's capital stack and the amount of leverage anyone is taking on.\nSo, for us, um, we are funded entirely by equity.\nSo, we raised a $100 million pipe, uh, and we were not taking on any leverage.\nWe have disclosed that we have this small line, uh, which we can pay back at any time, but basically, we want to do things in this risk-prudent fashion where you should take out a little bit of leverage if you are betting on an asset that will tend to move up over the medium term, but you have to make sure you don't take on too much leverage, uh, to where you can get in trouble and become a forced seller if the environment turns on you for unforeseen reasons.\nAnd so, we are growing, uh, and we are maximizing shareholder value, but we are doing it in this risk-prudent fashion to make sure that we can weather all market environments.\nUm, I think, like, it's obviously very tempting to take out as much leverage as possible, uh, to try to grow soul as much as possible or BTC as much as possible, but we're making sure we're doing this in this, like, risk-managed way, uh, to where, like, we'll be here no matter what.\nSo, can you clarify, like, the extent of the leverage you have then?\nUm, we, we, we disclosed it on the filing what we have, but we can't give you any real-time lifetime access to that because it's not public information, but we, we're maintaining, we, we've said publicly, we're trying to maintain under 20% leverage, which would allow us to weather most storms.\nThat is where, just to give you a comparison, that is where, uh, MicroStrategy places their leverage limit.\nSo, they won't take out debt greater than 20% relative to their NAV, and we're the exact same way.\nOkay.\nSo, what sort of, like, price drop could sort of be stomach?\nLike, you know, is, like, 80, 90% fine, or, or is that, like, game over at that sort of level of leverage?\nWell, that, I mean, that's, that's a big, big assumption that we wouldn't make any moves along that time, but, uh, I think with, with 80% with 20% leverage and 80% downturn, you know, and some people, you know, we want to talk about, you know, the all the downside with it, you know, obviously for us, if we have cash available in those times, those are just opportunities for us to add to, to, to treasury at that moment in time.\nSo, even though it sounds scary for downturns, downturns for companies who are prepared with both capital available and a good cap structure would use that to, like, like MicroStrategy has done over time.\nWe just use that to add to the treasury, you know, giving the shareholders a much bigger opportunity in the future.\nYeah, just to put it in perspective, and I'll speak in MicroStrategy terms, like, last I looked, they had 45 billion of unencumbered Bitcoin.\nUh, they do have convertible notes outstanding.\nThey have laded those with different maturities, and the different studies that I've seen is you would really need Bitcoin to fall 95% for, you know, five to seven years for there to be any credit risk and force selling.\nUm, and so we're trying to, uh, position ourselves the same way to where, you know, I think if we were in that environment, we've all got bigger things to worry about.\nBut, uh, but yes, um, yeah, I mean, it is, there is always risk around that, but we view it as, um, hopefully minimized.\nOkay.\nUm, and do you think in terms of, like, the large amounts of locked soul that have been sold over, like, the last few years and sort of becoming available?\nDo you think that is, is, is sort of depressing the price to some degree?\nOf keeping it, um, around the sort of, I mean, a lot of it was sold around $130, $140.\nUm, with that sort of continuous supply coming to the market, do you think that's might, uh, frustrate it for, for a couple of years, or, or is that nothing that investors need to worry about?\nI think this probably goes to, you know, why Upexi, pivoting, a lot of companies are pivoting to tra, to treasury companies or to, to more access to, uh, crypto, right?\nAs, as this administration now seems to have taken a tailwind, like a headwind provided over the last couple years to a tailwind here in the next four years.\nHopefully, you know, that overall adoption of crypto would, would eat up all of that, you know, all of the excess or whatever people anticipate.\nWe don't think there's an excess, but depending on your point of view, just that tailwind should provide support for, for the top digital assets.\nThere's not actually a ton out there.\nUm, many months ago, there was, I think you can almost look at the discounts as a proxy for how much supply of locked soul there is, and those discounts, obviously, in the crypto winter were 50% plus, now they're, like, mid-teens roughly.\nUm, and so what I'd say is, even when we first launched, we were getting marketed, uh, just like lock at a discount quite often, it's much less so now.\nUm, I'd say, like, we're not worried about our ability to access lock because we know and are close with all the major players, even if there are none out there being advertised as for sale, like, we can always ping all the major holders.\nUm, and also, too, a lot of the blocks that we're seeing are larger blocks to where, you know, you have a very limited set of buyers.\nThere's not that many folks that can actually act on that.\nYou know, we are one of them.\nAnd so, we think we'll still have good access, but I'm actually not, like, personally that worried about, like, a lot of lock soul being for sale depressing the price of Solana.\nOkay.\nWhat do you guys make of, uh, GameStop dropping 20%, uh, and Sharink dropping around 70%, um, after the sort of, you know, latest Treasury Reserve announcements?\nI mean, I could comment on GameStop.\nMeans, uh, just a constant, constant change of business model and unlimited equity financings for a business losing ridiculous amounts of money.\nBut, um, so on ESBA, we think, you know, even, even with these dig digital strategy companies, people have to understand how the value takes time.\nSo, we don't want to comment on anyone else's trading, but we're not too worried about it.\nWe believe in a strategy.\nSo, you know, we, we, we certainly wish, you know, ESP the best, and we have confidence that that, that their multiple will find its way, just like ours were.\nOurs will over time.\nThere's, I think I could mention this.\nSo, there's, like, a technical versus fundamental component happening here to where they raised a large pipe.\nUh, a lot of the folks in it, like, you can look at the S3 and see who it was.\nUm, and then what I'd say is, like, uh, you know, I think over the short term, there could be some folks that are looking to take gains, but over the long term, like, there is a potential for them to garner a more peer-like multiple.\nUm, in my stance, um, without getting too much into valuation, like, as you are a smaller company underpinned by an asset with all else equal, more growth potential, you should take this higher multiple.\nSo, I say that relative to, like, MicroStrategy, which last I looked was at 17.\nA lot of smaller companies, uh, should have this embedded growth premium, and then when you move off BTC, there should be this additional growth premium for growth in the underlying asset as well.\nSo, um, yeah, maybe I'll leave it there, but I think, like, over the long term, the fundamentals should come back in and overwhelm where some short-term technical selling pressure could be, you know, pushing the stock down maybe temporarily.\nOkay.\nAnd do you have any concerns about the number of companies that are acquiring these leverage positions?\nU, most of them are for Bitcoin.\nUh, I believe Anthony Pompiano is the latest person to set up a company to buy Bitcoin.\nLike, it just, it's definitely a flywheel for sure, but, but do you sort of have any concerns that it, it's sort of building up a little bit too much?\nI mean, we try to stay focused on our business and what we're doing.\nNow, obviously, we get concerned if, if people or companies, you know, do things that are irresponsible or too much leverage that maybe affect the perspective of the industry, but alls we can do is, you know, manage our house accordingly, and like Brian and I and our team plan to really just operate in a, you know, very, very forward-facing and professional manner and stick to our leverage and and just operate our business.\nBut, you know, obviously, there's a concern when this over, but we can't, we can't be responsible or or or worry too much about that.\nThe other thing that I'd add is this exactly right.\nLike, if you do things in a manner that is not befitting for a public company, you're imposing risks, but when done right, I actually think digital asset treasury companies are supremely positive for the token ecosystems that underly them.\nUh, and it's really for two reasons.\nOne is, um, we are effectively a one-way acquisition vehicle for soul, meaning that we have a buy and huddle strategy.\nThe endgame is for us not to push up price, but that could result because of it.\nAnd while this is not what we're trying to do, like a rising price will be beneficial for Solana to attract users, developers, and DAPs.\nUm, the second big thing is that we are raising visibility of Solana, particularly with traditional investors and institutions.\nI can't tell you how many calls Allan and I have done with sellside analysts, and a lot of them are asking what's the difference between a smart contract blockchain and, like, Bitcoin, and, you know, what is Solana, and what differentiates Solana, and we're out there evangelizing Solana to Wall Street, and I think, like, this is just a huge, huge benefit, uh, that we can provide, uh, the entire ecosystem.\nSure.\nAnd have you modeled out what could happen if strategies Bitcoin play unwinded, uh, very rapidly?\nNo.\nNo, we haven't.\nOther than to say, like, I think the odds are quite low, and you're seeing that with, like, the convertible investors giving them a basically free funding in the form of 0% interest rate.\nSo, I think, like, they are also effectively saying they think there is almost no credit risk there.\nUm, so, yeah, we haven't modeled it out exactly, but would just mention that at least I personally ascribe very low odds to that happening.\nOkay.\nWe try not to model out all the doom in the world.\nWe try to keep a perspective of, of something that we, you know, we think the future's a little brighter than that.\nFor sure.\nFor sure.\nMaybe I'm paranoid because I've been through so many sort of major systemic things in crypto from, you know, Luna, FTX, um, and, you know, and I, I've only been here and here not as long as Yeah.\nBut it, it's the same as it's the same as Wall Street, right?\nWe've been through all of the same things on Wall Street.\nAnd the truth is, whether you go back to, you know, the housing crisis, the, you know, the, the crashes, I mean, anyone who's been steady and well, I mean, just look at Warren Buffett and the greatest investors, they, they just ride through that.\nThey maintain a really steady hand.\nThey don't get panicked out by those.\nI think crypto has a lot of these, you know, things that are more severe because the investing public in it is probably a little bit younger and more apt to, you know, react a little, little, a little more, I guess, emotionally.\nBut we, we really, you know, think that whether it's a crypto winner or a good time, that if you're steady through it and we maintain a good process, that it should turn out, you know, in a, you know, the best possible scenario.\nYeah.\nI'd point out that there are these inevitable crypto winners, but there are also these inevitable crypto boom periods.\nAnd if you look at a company that does things right, like MicroStrategy, um, you're just kind of on pause during these crypto winners.\nAnd so, as long as you don't get over your skis, and I think, like, the best metric for MicroStrategy is Bitcoin per share.\nSo, in 2022, 2023, they were just a bit on pause with the capital market strategy.\nThey still increased Bitcoin per share by mid-single digits.\nAnd then last year, as you move into this inevitable boom period, they were able to increase Bitcoin per share 74%.\nThey basically created this Bitcoin gain, which is tantamount to free Bitcoin for shareholders, of 13 billion dollars given their access to the capital markets.\nAnd so, yes, I do think, like, this model could potentially be a bit on pause during bare markets, but, um, that's all it is is kind of on pause.\nYou do it right, and then when you move into the inevitable bull market, like, we could really just create a ton of value for shareholders at that point.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI think that's where that premium comes from, too.\nSorry for that.\nYeah.\nUh, but it's not just me.\nI was at a conference this week, and, uh, sort of, you know, in, in the speakers room, there definitely a few other high-profile people sort of talking quietly.\nYou know, not a lot of people want to be public about the risks of this.\nUm, but they sort of had concerns.\nAnd then also, uh, yesterday, we saw that Coinbase's Coinbase institutional's global head of research, uh, wrote a report that said the growing number of public companies focusing solely on acquiring crypto introduces systemic risks.\nUm, so there definitely are concerns about that.\nLike, is it worth the risk in all of these companies doing it if there is some risk that it could be the next Luna or FTX moment?\nI think this is why you have to be underpinned by an endgame winner.\nAnd what you're seeing is there are a lot of small-cap companies on NASDAQ that are seeing this as a playbook to have their stock move up, you know, quite a lot.\nUm, and they need to do something to\n\n\nDifferentiate themselves.\nSo, they're moving down the risk curve, moving into smaller and smaller tokens.\nUm, my personal view is there's only a small handful of assets that this could actually work on.\nUh, you need to have full confidence that you are underpinned by an asset that will not only be around in five years, um, but will also, you know, continue to do well because the biggest thing, uh, impacting our success is the performance of Solana.\nAnd so, you know, if you move down to the 200th largest token, you know, most of these altcoins end up down 95% after like three to five years.\nSo, you obviously don't want to be underpinned by a token like that.\nSo, this is a huge, huge competitive advantage for us.\nLike, we are the largest Solana treasury company by number of so held by market cap.\nUm, and we continue, we plan to continue to push, and we think being underpinned by uh, an endgame winning asset such as Solana gives us this big advantage.\nBut yeah, completely agree that um, not all of the not all of these are going to work.\n\nDo you imagine um, you might diversify the treasury into other assets or is it always going to be Solana?\nOnly Solana.\nWe, yeah.\nYeah.\nWe probably said it's Solana.\n\nOkay, cool.\nAnd what advice would you give to other companies that are considering holding crypto in their treasury but are unsure about the risks and benefits?\nWe, we honestly, we don't want to give a business advice to other people.\nYou know, we're, we're, we're, we're, our strategy is public.\nThey could use that playbook if they want.\nThat's that would be our best advice.\nYou know, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're stuck on um, and and have spent a lot of time, Brian and I and the team, the board developing a strategy we think is the most risk prudent we can do.\nAll businesses, all cryptos have have risk.\nSo, I think I think just learning to manage that would be the best best advice you can give anybody in business.\n\nGotcha.\nOkay.\nHow do you think uh, sort of crypto plays out over the next six to 12 months?\nSo we, you know, we think, and we've said this publicly too, is you know, any time in an industry where these headwinds that you've had, you know, if you've listened to the SEC, they said, you know, the US has trailed the rest of the world on crypto and on, you know, adopting crypto, you know, supporting the the infrastructure, the ecosystem.\nSo when that, when historically when any tailwinds, headwinds turn to tailwinds, industries usually flourish, you know, obviously there's still going to be like, like Brian said, the 200 token, 100, you don't know what's going to happen with any of those, in fact, you know, so we, we, we think it has all of the makings of a really good opportunity over the next not only six to 12 months, probably over the next like three to five years.\nYeah.\nShort term, like if if anyone asked me like where's crypto going to go over one to three months, my answer is probably with the macro, like it will depend on what happens with tariffs, what happens with like geopolitical tensions, what happens with inflation and potential monetary policy, but we just like plus one to what Allan said on like this key headwind turning into this tailwind with like more regulatory clarity in the US and this potentially just being one of the biggest potential catalyst for our industry that we almost might have ever seen.\nYeah.\nHistorically, whenever the the government kind of gives business people the rules that they can play by, people people find ways to to do really well.\nSo hopefully that's where we're at in crypto.\n\nYeah.\nAll right.\nWell, I've grilled you pretty hard.\nUm, you made it.\nWe can take it.\nWe can take it.\nUm, cool.\nWell, I want to thank you both for joining this episode.\nUm, and as a reminder, our newsroom works tirelessly to get you accurate, informed crypto news.\nIf you want to stay ahead, read The Block.\nThanks.\nSee you next time.\nThank you very much.\nThanks, Tim.\nThanks, Brian.\n",
