  "cleanText": "Hello and welcome to the Cryptobe. My name is Tim Copeland from The Block, Head of Growth. Joining me today, we have Chandler De Kock, founder of Silhouette. Welcome to the show. How's it going? Good, good. Thanks for having me. Brilliant. Before we get started, just a quick note. If you are hiring in crypto, you should use Campus, The Block's hiring platform. Help you pick out the real crypto natives. Head to theblock.co/campus to get a three-month free trial. Now today's episode is about dark pools on Hyperliquid, a fairly new development, something that Silhouette is hoping to bring out. So can you sort of explain what is Silhouette and what are dark pools? Oh, dark pools is a concept that comes from traditional finance. Typically, how you know trading happens in the uh traditional finance world is you've got your stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, and these are really good anchoring points for price discovery and for the market to coordinate around. Now they use different mechanisms um in different types of markets and but most of the time they they look like central order limit books um much to what you can see in like you know on Coinbase and Kraken um now today Hyperliquid um and these types of trading mechanisms are really really good for you to enter and exit markets for most of the use cases. Um, one of the other interesting developments that happened when you kind of coordinate your trading on these mechanisms is that if everyone were to kind of do their trades on these mechanisms, you would end up kind of slipping the market if you were to trade in size or you wanted to trade kind of OTC or do a different use a different mechanism. Um, one way particularly that you would do it off-book. Um, this is where kind of these dark pools uh emerged in finance. Now dark pools in finance is just simply kind of one firm trading with another firm and that trade would not necessarily be disclosed in any way shape or form. So the details of the trade would not necessarily be open and transparent and this gave kind of just like another venue for for traders to trade. And one of the key features there was um the privacy that it enabled. This is really an important development because in markets where price discovery and typically in traditional market price discovery was quite easy to find because you know the reporting standards made price discovery a concept that was fairly simple um to for for most traders to get access to. These dark pools actually enhance the ability for more traders to trade. And so what we noticed is that you know in with the addition of privacy being added to these traditional markets we basically had more trade happen as a net result. Now the transparency that we see in DeFi basically just gets a lot of that reporting and kind of just like access to the information around price discovery open to everyone to use. you basically just need an RPC provider and you can read the state from any sort of chain kind of at a very very cheap at very very low costs. Um and so what we're looking at wanting to build is a different mechanism to enable some of these private trading components not necessarily quite like in the definition of a dark pool in the traditional world but bring some of those components into the DeFi space. And kind of a key component here on why we think this is super important is most of the traditional kind of institutions that are looking at coming on-chain somewhat desire and demand some of these features. Sure thing. So how does Silhouette work? How does it keep transactions private? At the basis of what we're building on the tech stack side is some of the more um traditional types of cryptography that get enabled in the world. Trusted execution environments um have been around for ages. Uh these are you know your your uh fingerprint scanner on your MacBook Pro that uses a a secure enclave to kind of keep data protected within a a larger computer. So you can kind of think of it as this like protected computer within a larger computer. Um in addition to that like so that's where we can kind of run a lot of these like matching components to provide the the privacy that we need. But then there is this other component that really kind of a lot of the ZK side of the world, FHE and MPC type technology stacks really come into play. Uh so we can generate a proof from this trusted uh execution environment to tie into like the on-chain settlement. So from like a a build-out perspective, Silhouette's, you know, three components. Traders submit their order. That's the one component to Silhouette. We use these secure enclaves to privately match trades and order flow. And then the last component is settlement where we use ZK to ultimately settle on-chain. And in this in our specific case for our first kind of like roll out of our product that'll kind of go into um the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Okay. So when you say so you use the trusted execution environments where is that where the trades actually take place? So it's sort of done off uh offline or at least on your sort of the company's hardware. Yeah. So you can kind of think of a a trading environment as this like execution engine where it basically kind of matches orders uh according to certain logic. So one logic can be the way that Uniswap does it. So Uniswap uses the uh the the um in Uniswap v3 they've got these limit order type concepts. Uniswap v2 had the curve. Uh, Hyperliquid has a central order limit book. So, whatever that logic is, you can run that on basically any piece of hardware. Um, and you can run it on a server. That's just like a centralized version of how this would work. You could also run it in one of these enclaves, which gives you a little bit more security guarantees around what the actual matching engine is doing. Okay. So, so is it decentralized in the world of decentralization? What does decentralization mean? It's like how many people can run the node that ultimately gets consensus. Now in Ethereum I can spin up my node at home. I need 32 ETH can kind of get that set up fairly fairly simply and now I'm part of this decentralized network. In some other chains there's far less nodes um and that kind of you could assume it's less decentralized. There's like Nakamoto coefficient um is a good example of how decentralized a network is. And for our case um the way that you would kind of introduce decentralization is by having multiple of these execution environments running together. So if one went down the network as a whole would not necessarily break down. So um decentralization also is quite an important path that many teams kind of overindex on in the beginning that leads to some sort of stifling in the future. So we have a path to decentralization. um that path will be kind of taken a little bit more cautiously from our perspective. So we'll have like a small subnet of these trusted execution environments running in the beginning. We'll figure out that you know is this product something that we know where does this product fit within the market and you know what are the key features that we would want to enable that users would use and once that kind of starts generating a decent amount of value the concept of decentralization then becomes a little bit easier for us to rationalize around. So um you know we're we're starting very centralized in the beginning with a few execution environments and then slowly like increasing that over time when the value is kind of makes sense for these networks to actually become decentralized. Let's say if you have other people setting up these trusted execution environments, how do you know that what they're doing is according to the specific rules that you want to be in place? And then also how do people know that your environment is subject to those rules? So we achieve this by kind of like working through a couple there's a couple layers to this. The first layer that kind of makes what the guarantees of what you're running within these execution environments is that even if I'm the I'm running the software. So Tim, you running one of our trusted execution environments, you can't access what's happening on the inside of that enclave. So even if you own the hardware and run the hardware um and then kind of like want to tamper with the system, we you can't do that. So these these are why these enclaves are super secure and the the access to them is very very tightly controlled. The only thing that you can really do is just simply turn your system off um and now you're no longer part of the network. So that's kind of one of the areas that we're we're kind of working with um some of these TE providers to kind of add some robustness there. The second one is well like you know the code that runs inside of those execution environments can be open source. So we can say this is what the matching engine's going to do. We publish the code. We write the documentation around that and then within the enclave you can generate an execution proof that the you can see what the code is going to do. It did what it did and then you can generate a proof that that actually was executed correctly. And that's part of the where the settlement proofs um that go on-chain come from. And so not only can we make sure that like you know access to these execution environments is somewhat gated, we can also make sure that the code that's running within them is super secure and then we can even create proof to show the user, oh at the end of the day what you said it should do, it actually did and here's the verification of that. Okay. So if someone else sets up uh one of these environments, they don't build it themselves. You would give them the secure enclave. Is that right? Yeah. So uh there are a couple trusted execution environment providers. I think the one that's most commonly used is AWS Nitro. So Amazon have their versions of it. Apple have enclaves running on every iPhone and every uh MacBook today. So this concept is actually quite well known. Um there are other few providers and there are even web3 specific providers. So the one that we're partnering with in the early days is Maron. Maron kind of take care of a lot of the infrastructure and we tie into their network of TEs that can kind of like you know be a part of this. Now in the future let's say anyone wants to come, they they've got their TEs, they know how to get that infrastructure set up and running there will be a spec on what this needs to conform to. You'll then come to the network and say I want to be a TE. you check you do the checks that this this hardware and infrastructure does match that that spec and then you can comp provide your TE to that network. So why did you choose Hyperliquid as a base for this platform? Like why did you choose to build on it? Every time a new cryptographic paradigm came out prior to you know what we have today the first thing developers developed was a dark pool. you know, ZK, they built ZK dark pools. they built an FHE dark pool. MPC, you name it. There's there's hundreds of these implementations of how you can build privacy trading mechanisms. And by and large, most of them have failed for a couple reasons. One of them is that they typically like have low liquidity. And you know, liquidity normally kind of has alpha attached to it. And the privacy is there to protect the alpha. And so there's no liquidity, there's no alpha. And so traders typically haven't really just like bootstrapped these markets um relatively efficiently because privacy in itself doesn't sell. Privacy sells only in the pursuit of protecting alpha. And so when we were looking at how we could implement our version of this, it was really more a go-to-market question as opposed to a technical question. And when you looked at how liquidity typically flowed, Hyperliquid was kind of growing as this nexus point for a large amount of traders. You know, pre their TGE, it was somewhat like known by a couple traders, but not really as on the map as it is today. And so they grew a community quite organically. They they also developed um pretty much the the standard of how DEXes will be deployed going forward. And when we looked at kind of a venue for where we could tie these dark pools into, it was very clear to us that we needed to tie into a really sufficiently um kind of robust ecosystem. And that's where Hyperliquid came in. And so for us the the choice was more a case of we we knew that just privacy but for privacy's sake was not going to be enough of a sufficient set of tools uh for traders to come organically to an isolated market. But instead bringing privacy to where a lot of alpha is already being generated by a lot of these traders that are trading organically. And so therefore, like it made sense to build alongside a liquid venue as opposed to just simply an isolated privacy DEX. And how bullish are you on Hyperliquid as a layer 1 ecosystem? I think their track record kind of speaks for themselves and there are a couple interesting components that are being developed that I'm personally excited by. So the first one I would kind of, you know, showcase is that they deployed an EVM. So you've got this fully expressive um side chain that you can build the rest of DeFi with and we're seeing a bunch of projects come out there. You got your standard DeFi lending market. You've got some swap markets, some aggregators that are going there. And so for most of the users, one of the areas that they will be able or one of these app developers um will tie into who would want to leverage against whatever the assets they have can tie into a lending market that then has the backstop of an entirely like you know extremely well functioning L1 DEX. So the bootstrapping problem for this for the chain is kind of already solved and these liquidity engines is what saves chains. Look at Uniswap for Ethereum. look at GMX for Arbitrum. That's kind of what generates most of the activity for these chains and almost all of DeFi requires these liquidity engines. And then the secondary part that I think is like kind of more exciting that's a little bit more future-looking um is uh concepts like HIPP3 where you can deploy your own per markets that basically with just a subset of requirements um can I think you need to stake a million Hype um as a security mechanism you can generate and create your own purpose markets kind of really kind of owning the decentralization component of of you know create your own markets Now the third part um that I'm quite excited about as to like why this is going to be quite interesting is if you think about how um most teams list their coins now they typically go to their uh to a Binance they sell their souls to the devil that deal's never in favor of the project and it's almost extractive but you can't not have your token not launched on Binance because that component in itself um is what gets gets a lot of people interested in your project and adds a lot of value to your token. With these kind of new developments happening in Hyperliquid, we're seeing teams actually not even consider the centralized exchange route and might go directly to these decentralized um DEX routes and ultimately kind of have an\n\nAlternative that the barrier to entry is far less. You still have extremely active markets that you can tie into. And so for most projects that are thinking about their token strategy, this is an extremely compelling case that I think will draw a lot more projects to the ecosystem than any other ecosystem out there. And then what were your thoughts on James Wynn trading in size in public? We got a really good amount of attention after that, and it really highlights the case of what some of the problems are for trading completely naked on-chain. So when James kind of played his hand out in the market, it gathered a lot of attention, and you immediately had the responses that came either through the market forces that he perceived as moving against him, or even just the public sentiment and the folks that were chatting on crypto Twitter around it. And in James' case, it might be the way that he wanted to play that set of trades, and I can't really speak to how much he knows or what he was trying to do there. But if you're a larger institution or you want to not have that attention drawn to you, there is very little options that you have to build that type of position in a market without tools like Silhouette. And so for us, it really put a nail in the head in terms of what the benefits we would provide to an ecosystem like Hyperliquid. And is it rewarding to see CZ saying that we need dark pools? Yeah, I think CZ's position for dark pools is actually clear. Like, you know, Binance naturally has a dark pool type component to their business. They have an OTC desk, and there are parts of the ecosystem that they work with. And so, him jumping into the conversation also kind of added a bit more wind to our sails. And so for us, it was just a validation from a conversational, an open public conversation on what we've believed for the last six months. And did you see that Andrew Tate accidentally revealed his DEX trading history? He did dox his wallet, but I don't think he realized people would see all of his history of previous trades. I didn't actually see that. Not surprised. Anything funny that came out of that? Well, I guess the salient point was, I assume if you had dark pools, that information wouldn't be able to be released, would it? Or does the transaction information become public after time? You know, blockchains will always be blockchains, and that information will always be public. So, I don't think the concept of what was in Andrew Tate's wallet or in James Wynn's wallet is necessarily going to change. It's a completely new ecosystem. But in terms of what traders care about from their perspective, the overall accumulation of their wallet is not necessarily something that they care too much about, especially in the blockchain context. But what they do care about is when trades are live and when they're in a market or in a specific position over a period of time. That time is not typically over years long. Trades can sometimes be as short as a couple of minutes to maybe a week to a couple of months. That's when that information is super sensitive to the trader, and that's what they would want to protect. And so, I think the concept of having traders' personal information be protected in a global but open and transparent market is the unique differentiator where most of these privacy pools have been 100% private. Nothing you can never see into them. It's complete darkness, which is somewhat different to our approach. We do believe that DeFi offers this ability for people to verify the state of the market, but allowing a specific trader the tool to protect their position relative to the market is somewhat of a nuance difference that we're exploring. And what are the biggest challenges to building something like this? I think previously it was around the technology. So about two, three years ago, ZK was growing at a pace that today we've got super fast proofs that are being generated out there. A lot of the interest in these privacy technologies and the research, developer experience, and ultimate performance of them kind of makes it the perfect time to be launching some of these protocols in a way that the tech has matured to a point where it makes a lot of sense. So the technical challenges have somewhat been solved. The next component is really understanding what do traders actually care about? What do the users of tools like what we would provide actually care about? I think the case is kind of obvious, but when you ask them what do you care about when you want to protect your privacy? What levels of latency do you care about? There's a lot of minutiae around that that I think is somewhat unexplored in the public sphere. Most folks that work in the privacy space either care about full privacy, and most folks in the market space don't really know too much about the cryptography side to implement it in an efficient way. And there is this small overlap of teams like ourselves and a couple others that care about that intersection, and building a product that really caters for that intersection is what we've been spending the last six months deeply understanding. And it takes a lot of conversations, a lot of research, and a lot of security reviews to make sure the system that you build out at the end of the day matches both user demand and ultimately the security requirements for working on-chain today. And how do dark pools work with market makers? Like, is it possible for market makers to participate in them, or does it not really work? Yeah, of course. So each dark pool is constructed somewhat differently. I think there are very many ways that you could go about it. So it depends on how you would implement it. If you've got a central order limit book running inside one of these enclaves, then yes, of course, you can have market makers participate. Some dark pool mechanisms use RFQ, or request for quote. So it's just a simple quote. You just know the details of what that quote would be, and a market maker can just simply say yes or no to that. And so it's very mechanism dependent. But most market makers are actually dark pools in themselves. Their OTC desks work in a very similar concept for the same economic need. So market makers for a long time have been the crypto equivalent of dark pools. There just hasn't been a marketplace coordination mechanism or product out there to allow multiple market makers and multiple users to start aggregating some of these deal flows. And what are your next steps for going live? The team's been doing our internal testing over the past couple weeks. We will be going through a process of kicking the tires, polishing some of the components, getting some very critical user feedback on what we can improve. Soon after that, the goal would naturally be to extend that into a broader beta testing phase. That beta testing phase will be where we go live within the Hyperliquid ecosystem on mainnet, and then post that, it's just feature enhancements, performance improvements, and naturally catering to the types of trades traders would want to place using mechanisms. And when are you targeting a launch date? Launch dates TBD. It's interesting from a web3 perspective, it typically works in these waterfall mechanisms where you develop a whole bunch of code, you have the product at a near-complete state, you ship it off to an auditor, they review it, and then you publish your contracts, you stitch everything together, and you launch it. That process typically takes quite a lot of time, mainly just because the contracts need to be in a finalized state. And so the approach that most teams take in web2 is typically very iterative. Make the basic system work end-to-end and then bolt-on features afterwards. For web3, it's somewhat a different process. So we're kind of in the final stages of finalizing our contracts, getting them securely reviewed, and then once that process completes, security can be anywhere from two to three weeks to two to three months, and it all depends on the complexity of the system and the feature set that you want to launch with. And are you going to do like a points program or something? It's interesting that the points matter has become so valuable in the space as an initial user attraction. I think there is a case that we're definitely considering points and we're definitely considering incentive mechanisms in general. One of the natural benefits of building these off-chain privacy matching engines is that you're not beholden to the same fee structure as a typical exchange. And so, we might be considering straight-up revenue streams as part of the benefit that we have. So, you're trading on Silhouette, you could get fee rebates, you could get any savings that you have as a function of your execution, that could be a benefit. And then also the points program. So, balancing how we actually build out a compelling reason for users to use us over and above just privacy is something that we've been deeply discussing with some folks. TBD on a points program. I find them very interesting as bootstrapping mechanisms, and for us, we just want to be thoughtful on their application. Do you think you'll do a token? Same thought pattern as points, and also same thought pattern under the decentralization component. What's the token for is quite a deep question that many teams didn't early on. It was a very easy, \"Oh, we're decentralized, the protocol is governed by this token,\" and then they had the headache of managing the governance token when trying to implement new features and grow their ecosystem. I think this is a bit of an inhibitor at this point in time. I also think folks are kind of tired of these altcoin tokens launching, having very fractional adoption, very fractional amounts of time that they remain relevant. And so realistically, is this the right market to launch a token? I don't necessarily think so right now. And so when we're considering a token launch from our perspective, we again think through the incentives, think through why the token really matters, but also added to the fact that tokens are normally a decentralization force. So distributing your token to the community, what's the value of holding the token? I think Hyperliquid has done a really good example of why holding the Hyperliquid token is really valuable with their buyback mechanisms and their staking features. But that does not necessarily need to be copied by every team within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. So for us, tokens are something that we'll probably also consider after the product has launched and after there's initial user traction. What's your vision if Silhouette succeeds? The clear metric that I care about when thinking about the impact I want Silhouette to have is this CEX to DEX ratio. I kind of want to get those to feature parity so that DEXes are trading as much, if not more, value than centralized exchanges. I think the value proposition for access to markets makes so much more sense and pushes the frontier of DeFi a lot more. And the mechanisms that we need to do to get there, like having features like privacy being built out. So having Silhouette being a forcing function for that outcome is really important and an attraction for net new capital into the entire crypto ecosystem to not only challenge how markets get developed within the DEX side of the world, but have folks like on the traditional finance side take a bit more interest in these crypto markets as an asset class and build their own mechanisms of bringing their capital into crypto. They'll naturally go through the centralized exchanges and custodians first. And so the gateway into that market is definitely through the custodians, but have really seamless native integrations with the current folks that are managing institutional funds. All right. Well, what an exciting vision. We'll see if it takes place. That's all we have for today.
