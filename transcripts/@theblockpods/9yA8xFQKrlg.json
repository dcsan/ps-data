  "cleanText": "Head to the bot.co/campus to get a three-month free trial. Now, today's episode is about dark pools on Hyperliquid, a fairly new development, something that Silhouette is hoping to bring out. So, can you sort of explain what is Silhouette and what are dark pools?\n\nCool. Dark pools is a concept that comes from traditional finance. Typically, how you know trading happens in the traditional finance world is you've got your stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, and these are really good anchoring points for price discovery and for the market to coordinate around. Now, they use different mechanisms in different types of markets, but most of the time they look like central order limit books, much to what you can see in Coinbase and Kraken. Now, today Hyperliquid and these types of trading mechanisms are really, really good for you to enter and exit markets for most of the use cases. One of the other interesting developments that happened when you kind of coordinate your trading on these mechanisms is that if everyone were to kind of do their trades on these mechanisms, you would end up kind of slipping the market if you were to trade in size or you wanted to trade kind of OTC or do a different use a different mechanism. One way, particularly, that you would do it off-book. This is where kind of these dark pools emerged in finance. Now, dark pools in finance is just simply one firm trading with another firm, and that trade would not necessarily be disclosed in any way, shape, or form. So, the details of the trade would not necessarily be open and transparent, and this gave kind of just like another venue for traders to trade. And one of the key features there was the privacy that it enabled. This is really an important development because in markets where price discovery and typically in traditional market price discovery was quite easy to find because you know the reporting standards made price discovery a concept that was fairly simple to for most traders to get access to. These dark pools actually enhance the ability for more traders to trade. And so what we noticed is that you know in with the additional privacy being added to these traditional markets, we basically had more trade happen as a net result. Now, the transparency that we see in DeFi basically just gets a lot of that reporting and kind of just like access to the information around price discovery open to everyone to use. You basically just need an RPC provider and you can read the state from any sort of chain kind of at a very, very cheap at very, very low costs. And so what we're looking at wanting to build is a different mechanism to enable some of these private trading components, not necessarily quite like in the definition of a dark pool in the traditional world, but bring some of those components into the DeFi space. And kind of a key component here on why we think this is super important is most of the traditional kind of institutions that are looking at coming on chain somewhat desire and demand some of these features.\n\nSure thing. So how does Silhouette work? How does it keep transactions private?\n\nYeah. At the basis of what we're building on the tech side is some of the more traditional types of cryptography that get enabled in the world. Trusted execution environments have been around for ages. These are you know your your fingerprint scanner on your MacBook Pro that uses a secure enclave to kind of keep data protected within a larger computer. So you can kind of think of it as this like protected computer within a larger computer. In addition to that, like so that's where we can kind of run a lot of these like matching components to provide the privacy that we need, but then there is this other component that really kind of a lot of the ZK side of the world, FH, and MPC type technology stacks really come into play, so we can generate a proof from this trusted execution environment to tie into like the onchain settlement. So from like a buildout perspective, Silhouette's you know three components. Traders submit their order. That's the one component to Silhouette. We use these secure enclaves to privately match trades and order flow. And then the last component is settlement where we use ZK to ultimately settle onchain. And in this in our specific case for our first kind of like rollout of our product, that'll kind of go into the Hyperliquid ecosystem.\n\nOkay. So when you say so you use the trust execution environments, where is that where the trades actually take place? So it's sort of done off offline or at least on your sort of the company's hardware.\n\nYeah. So you can kind of think of a trading environment as this like execution engine where it basically kind of matches orders according to certain logic. So one logic can be the way that Uniswap does it. So Uniswap uses the the um in Uniswap v3, they've got these limit order type concepts. Uniswap B2 had the curve. Hyperliquid has a central order limit book. So whatever that logic is, you can run that on basically any piece of hardware. And you can run it on a server that's just like a centralized version of how this would work. You could also run it in one of these enclaves, which gives you a little bit more security guarantees around what the actual matching engine is doing.\n\nOkay. So So is it decentralized?\n\nThe decentraliz so what in in the world of decentralization, what does decentralization mean? It's like how many people can run the node that ultimately gets consensus? Now in Ethereum, I can spin up my node at home. I need 32 ETH, can kind of get that set up fairly, fairly simply, and now I'm part of this decentralized network. In some other chains, there's far less nodes, and that kind of you could assume it's less decentralized. There's like Nakamoto coefficient is a good example of how decentralized a network is. And for our case, the way that you would kind of introduce decentralization is by having multiple of these execution environments running together. So if one went down, the network as a whole would not necessarily break down. So decentralization also is quite an important path that many teams kind of overindex on in the beginning that leads to some sort of stifling in the future. So we have a path to decentralization. That path will be kind of taken a little bit more cautiously from our perspective. So we'll have like a small subnet of these trusted execution environments running in the beginning. We'll figure out that you know is this product something that we know where does this product fit within the market and you know what are the key features that we would want to enable that users would use, and once that kind of starts generating a decent amount of value, the concept of decentralization then becomes a little bit easier for us to rationalize around. So you know we're starting very centralized in the beginning with a few execution environments and then slowly like increasing that over time when the value is kind of makes sense for these networks to actually become decentralized.\n\nOkay. And then how let's say if you have other people setting up these trust execution environments, how do you know that what they're doing is according to the specific rules that you want to be in place? And then also how do people know that your environment is subject to those rules?\n\nYeah, this is actually a key to why we chose execution environment. So the one so one of the so we achieved this by kind of like working through a couple there's a couple layers to this. The first layer that kind of makes what the guarantees of what you're running within these execution environments is that even if I'm the I'm running the software. So Tim, you running one of our trusted execution environments, you can't access what's happening on the inside of that enclave. So even if you own the hardware and run the hardware and then kind of like want to tamper with the system, we you can't do that. So these these are why these enclaves are super secure and the the access to them is very, very tightly controlled. The only thing that you can really do is just simply turn your system off. And now you're no longer part of the network. So that's kind of one of the areas that we're we're kind of working with some of these TE providers to kind of add some robustness there. The second one is well like you know the code that runs inside of those execution environments can be open source. So we can say this is what the matching engine's going to do. We publish the code. We write the documentation around that. And then within the enclave, you can generate an execution proof that the you can see what the code is going to do. It did what it did. And then you can generate a proof that that actually was executed correctly. And that's part of the way the settlement proofs that go onchain come from. And so not only can we make sure that like you know access to these execution environments is somewhat gated, we can also make sure that the code that's running within them is super secure and then we can even create proof to show the user, oh at the end of the day what you said it should do, it actually did and here's the verification of that.\n\nYeah. Okay. So if someone else sets up uh one of these environments, they don't build it themselves. You would give them the secure enclave. Is that right?\n\nYeah. So, uh there are a couple trusted execution environment providers. I think the one that's most commonly used is AWS Nitro. So, Amazon have their versions of it. Apple have enclaves running on every iPhone and every MacBook today. So, this concept is actually quite well known. Um there are other few providers and there are even web 3 specific providers. So, the one that we're partnering with in the early days is Marin. Marin kind of take care of a lot of the infrastructure and we tie into their network of tees that can kind of like you know be a part of this. Now in the future let's say anyone wants to come they they've got their TEES they know how to get that infrastructure set up and running there will be a spec on what this needs to conform to. You'll then come to the network and say I want to be a TE. you check you do the checks that this this hardware and infrastructure does match that that spec and then you can compro provide your TE to that network.\n\nAll right. And then so why did you choose Hyperliquid as a base for this platform? Like why did you choose to build on it?\n\nYeah. So going back, you know, every time a new cryptographic paradigm came out prior to, you know, what we have today, the first thing developers developed was a dark pool. You know, ZK, they built ZK dark pools. FE, they built an FG dark pool. MPC, you name it. There's there's hundreds of these implementations of how you can build privacy trading mechanisms. And by and large, most of them have failed for a couple reasons. One of them is that they typically like have low liquidity and you know liquidity normally kind of has alpha attached to it and the privacy is there to protect the alpha and so there's no liquidity there's no alpha and so traders typically haven't really just like bootstrapped these markets relatively efficiently because privacy in itself doesn't sell. Privacy sells only in the pursuit of protecting alpha and so when we were looking at how we could implement our version of this, it was really more a go-to-market question as opposed to a technical question. And when you looked at how liquidity typically flowed, Hyperliquid was kind of growing as this nexus point for a large amount of traders. You know, pre their TGE, it was somewhat like known by a couple traders, but not really as on the map as it is today. And so they grew a community quite organically. They they also developed pretty much the the standard of how dexes will be deployed going forward. And when we looked at kind of a venue for where we could tie these dark pools into, it was very clear to us that we needed to tie into a really sufficiently kind of robust ecosystem. And that's where Hyperliquid came in. And so for us the the choice was more a case of we we knew that just privacy but for privacy's sake was not going to be enough of a sufficient set of tools for traders to come organically to an isolated market. But instead bringing privacy to where a lot of alpha is already being generated by a lot of these traders that are trading organically. And so therefore, like it made sense to build alongside a liquid venue as opposed to just simply an isolated privacy deck.\n\nSure. And how bullish are you on Hyperliquid as a layer 1 ecosystem.\n\nI think their track record kind of speaks for themselves and there are a couple interesting components that are being developed that I'm personally excited by. So the first one I would kind of, you know, showcase is that they deployed an EVM. So you've got this fully expressive side chain that you can build the rest of DeFi with. And we're seeing a bunch of projects come out there. You got your standard DeFi lending market. You've got some swap markets, some aggregators that are going there. And so for most of the users, one of the areas that they will be able or one of these app developers will tie into who would want to leverage against whatever the assets they have can tie into a lending market that then has the backs stop of an entirely like you know extremely well functioning L1 DEX. So the bootstrapping problem for this for the chain is kind of already solved and these liquidity engines is what saves chains. Look at Uniswap for Ethereum. look at GMX for Arbitrum. That's kind of what generates most of the activity for these chains and almost all of DeFi requires these liquidity engines. And then the secondary part that I think is like kind of more exciting that's a little bit more future-looking is concepts like HIPP3 where you can deploy your own purpose markets that basically with just a subset of requirements you can I think you need to stake a million hype as a security mechanism, you can generate and create your own purpose markets kind of really kind of owning the decentralization component of of you know create your own markets. Now the third part that I'm quite excited about as to like why this is going to be quite interesting is if you think about how most teams list their coins now, they typically go to their to a Binance, they sell their souls to the devil, that deal is never in favor of the project and it's almost extractive, but you can't not have your token not launched on Binance because that component in itself is what gets a lot of people interested in your project and adds a lot of value to your token. With these kind of new developments happening in Hyperliquid, we're seeing teams actually not even consider the centralized exchange route and might go directly to these decentraliz decentralized DEX routes and ultimately kind of have an alternative that the barrier to entry is far less. You still have extremely active markets that you can you can tie into. And so for like for most projects that are thinking about, you know, their token strategy, this is an extremely com\n\n\nA compelling case that I think will draw a\nlot more projects to the ecosystem than\nany other ecosystem out there.\nAll right. And then what were your\nthoughts on James Win trading in size in\npublic?\nYeah, we got a really good amount of\nattention after that, and it really\nhighlights the case of what some of the\nproblems are for trading completely\nnaked on chain. So when you know James\nkind of, you know, played his hand out\nin the market, um, it gathered a lot of\nattention, and you immediately had the\nresponses that came either through\nthe market forces that were, you know,\nthat he perceived as moving against him.\nUm, but even just the public sentiment\nand kind of the folks that were chatting\non crypto Twitter around it. Um, and you\nknow, in James' case, it might be the\nway that he wanted to play that set\nof trades. And I'm not going to really, I\ncan't really speak to how much he\nknows or what he was trying to do there.\nUm, but if you're a larger institution or\nyou, you kind of want to not have that\nattention drawn to you, there is very\nlittle options that you have to kind of\nlike build that type of position in a\nmarket that you'd want to have a\nposition in a market without kind of\ntools like Silhouette. And so for us, it\nit really like put a nail on the head in\nterms of like what the benefits we would\nprovide to an ecosystem like Hyperliquid.\nAnd is it rewarding to see CZ saying\nthat we need dark pools?\nYeah, I think CZ's position for dark\npools is actually clear, like, you know,\nBinance naturally have a darkpool type\ncomponent to their business. They have\nan OTC desk, and there's kind of parts of\nthe ecosystem that they work\nwith. And so him jumping in into the\nconversation also kind of like added a\nbit more win to our sales. Um, and so\nfor us, it was just validation from a\nconversational, an open public\nconversation on what we've believed for\nthe last 6 months.\nAnd did you see that Andrew Tate\naccidentally revealed his DEX trading\nhistory because he docked his wallet,\nbut I don't think he realized people\nwould see all of his sort of history of\nprevious trades?\nI didn't actually see that. Um, not\nsurprised. Anything funny that came\nout of that?\nWell, I guess I think the salient\npoint was, I assume if you had dark pools\nthat wouldn't\nthat information would be able to be\nreleased, would it?\nOr does the transaction information\nbecome public after time?\nI think, yeah. So, you know, blockchains\nwill always be blockchains, and that\ninformation will always be public. So, I\ndon't think the concept of what was in\nAndrew Tate's wallet or in James W's\nwallet is necessarily going to change.\nIt's a completely new ecosystem. But\nin terms of, you know, if you think\nabout what traders care about from their\nperspective, the overall accumulation of\ntheir wallet is not necessarily\nsomething that they care too much about,\nespecially in the blockchain context.\nBut what they do care about is when\ntrades are live and when they're in the\nmarket or in a specific position over a\nperiod of time. That time is not\ntypically over years long period. You\nknow, trades sometimes can be as short\nas a couple minutes to maybe a week to a\ncouple months long time frame. That's\nwhen that information is super sensitive\nto the trader, and that's what they would\nwant to protect. And so for us, I think\nthe concept of having traders personal\ninformation be protected in a global but\nopen and transparent market, I think is\nthe unique differentiator where most of\nthese privacy pools have been 100%\nprivate. Nothing, you can never see into\nthem. It's complete darkness is\nsomewhat different to our approach. We\ndo believe that DeFi offers this, you\nknow, ability for people to verify the\nstate of the market, but allowing a\nspecific trader the tool to protect\ntheir position relative to the market is\nis somewhat of a nuanced kind of\ndifference, uh, that we're we're\nexploring. Yeah. And what are the\nbiggest challenges to building something\nlike this?\nUm,\nI think previously it was around the the\ntechnology. So about 2, 3 years ago,\nuh, ZK was, you know, growing at a at a\npace that today we've got like super\nfast proofs that are being generated out\nthere. Um, a lot of the interest in\nthese privacy technologies and like the\nresearch,\ndeveloper experience, and ultimate\nperformance of them kind of makes it now\nis kind of the perfect time to be\nlaunching some of these protocols, um, in\na way that the tech matured to a\npoint where it makes a lot of sense.\nNow,\nso the technical challenges have\nsomewhat been solved. Um, the next kind\nof component is really understanding\nwhat do traders actually care about?\nWhat do the users of kind of tools\nlike what we would provide actually care\nabout? I think there's, there's, you\nknow, the case is kind of obvious,\nbut when you ask them, you know, what do\nyou care about when when you want to\nprotect your privacy? What levels of\nlatency do you care about? You know,\nthere's a lot of minutia around that\nthat I think, um, is somewhat like\nunexplored in the public sphere. Most\nfolks that kind of work in the privacy\nspace either care about full privacy, and\nmost folks in the market space don't\nreally know too much about the\ncryptography side to implement it in an\nefficient way. And there is this small\noverlap with teams like ourselves and a\ncouple others that care about that\nintersection, and kind of building a\nproduct that really caters for that\nintersection for us is is is what we've\nkind of been spending the last 6 months\ndeeply, deeply understanding. And it\ntakes a lot of conversations. It takes a\nlot of research, and it takes a lot of\nsecurity reviews to kind of make sure a\nsystem that you build out at the end of\nthe day matches both user demand and\nultimately the security requirements for\nworking on chain today.\nYeah. And how do dark pools work with uh\nmarket makers? Like is it possible for\nmarket makers to participate in them or\ndoes it not really work?\nYeah, of course. So each dogpool's\nconstructed somewhat differently. I\nthink there's there's very many ways\nthat you could go about it. So it\ndepends on how you would implement it.\nIf you've got um a central order limit\nbook running inside one of these\nenclaves, then yes, of course, you can\nhave market makers participate. Um, some\ndarkpool mechanisms use RFQ or a request\nfor quote. So, it's just a simple quote.\nYou just know the the the details of\nwhat that quote would be, and a market\nmaker can just simply say yes or no to\nthat. Um, and so it's very mechanism\ndependent. Um, but most market makers\nare actually dark pools in themselves.\nTheir OTC desks work in a very similar\nconcept for the same somewhat economic\nneed. So market makers for a long time\nhave been the crypto equivalent of\ndarkpools. Um, there just hasn't been\nsort of like a marketplace\ncoordination mechanism or product out\nthere to allow multiple market makers\nand multiple users to start kind of\naggregating some of these deal flows.\nOkay. And what are your next steps for\ngoing live?\nNext steps for going live. So, um, the\nteam's been doing our internal testing\nover the past couple weeks. Um, we will\nbe going through a process of, you know,\nkicking the tires, polishing some of the\nthe components, um, getting some some\nvery, very critical user feedback on what\nwe can improve. Uh, soon after that, the\ngoal would naturally be to kind of\nextend that into a broader beta testing\nphase. Um, that beta testing phase will\nbe, um, where we kind of go live within\nthe Hyperliquid ecosystem on mainnet,\nand then, uh, post that, it's just feature\nenhancements, performance improvements,\nand naturally kind of, you know, catering\nto the types of trades traders would\nwant to place using mechanisms.\nOkay. And when are you targeting uh a\nlaunch date?\nLaunch dates TBD. Um, it's interesting\nfrom a web 3 perspective. It\ntypically works in these waterfall\nmechanisms where you develop a whole\nbunch of code. You somewhat have the the\nproduct at like near complete state. You\nship it off to an auditor, they review\nit, and then you kind of publish your\ncontracts, you you you stitch everything\ntogether, and you launch it. That process\ntypically takes quite a lot of time, um,\nmainly just because the contracts need\nto be in somewhat of a finalized state.\nAnd so the the approach that most teams\ntake, um, in web 2 is typically been very\niterative. Make the basic system work\nend to end and then bolt-on features\nafterwards. Um, for web 3, it's somewhat\na different process. So we're kind of in\nthe final stages of finalizing our our\ncontracts, getting them securely\nreviewed, and then, you know, once that\nprocess completes, security can be\nanywhere from, you know, two to three\nweeks to somewhere to two to three\nmonths, and it all depends on the\ncomplexity of the system and and\nultimately the the the feature set that\nyou want to launch with.\nSure thing. And are you going to do like\na points program or something?\nIt's interesting that the points matter\nhas become so valuable in the space, um,\nas an initial kind of user attraction. I\nthink there is a case that, you know,\nwe're definitely considering points, and\nwe're definitely considering incentive\nmechanisms in general. Um, one of the\nthe natural benefits of of kind of\nbuilding these these off-chain privacy\nmatching engines is that you're not\nbeholden to the same fee structure from\nas a typical exchange. And so, you know,\nwe we might be considering like straight\nup revenue streams as part of the the\nbenefit that we have. So, you know,\ntrading on Silhouette, you could get fee\nrebates, you could kind of, you know,\nany savings that you have as a function\nof your execution, that could be a\nbenefit. Um, and then also the points\nprogram. So, you know, balancing how do\nwe actually ultimately build out a\ncompelling reason for users to use us\nover and above just privacy is is\nsomething that we've been deeply\ndiscussing with some folks. So TBD on a\npoints program. Um, I find them very\ninteresting as as bootstrapping\nmechanisms, and for us, we just kind of\nwant to be thoughtful on their\napplication.\nCool. Do you think you'll do a token?\nToken is the, you know, same same thought\npattern as points\nand also same thought pattern under the\ndecentralization component. What's the\ntoken for is quite a deep question that\nmany teams I think didn't early early on\nwas, you know, a very easy, oh, we're\ndecentralized, the protocols governed by\nthis token, and then they had the\nheadache of of\nmanaging the governance token when\ntrying to implement new features and\ngrow and kind of like develop their\necosystem. Um, I think this is a little\nbit of an inhibitor, um, at this point in\ntime. I also think folks are kind of\ntired of these altcoin tokens launching\nhaving, you know, very fractional\nadoption, very fractional like amount of\ntime that they remain relevant. Um, and\nso realistically, like, is this the right\nmarket to launch a token? I don't\nnecessarily think so right now. Um, and\nso when we're considering token a token\nlaunch from our perspective, we we again\nthink through the incentives, think\nthrough why, why, why the token really\nmatters, but also added to the fact that\ntokens are normally a decentralization\nforce. So, you know, distributing your\ntoken to the community, what's the value\nof holding the token? I think Hyperliquid\nhave done a really good example of why\nholding the Hype token is really\nvaluable with their buyback buyback\nmechanisms and their staking features.\nUm, but that does not necessarily need\nto be copied by every single team within\nthe Hyperliquid ecosystem. So for us,\ntokens are are something that we'll\nprobably also even consider after the\nproduct has launched and after there's\ninitial user traction.\nAnd what's your vision if Silhouette\nsucceeds?\nI think,\nfor me,\na clear example, um, a clear metric that\nI kind of care about when thinking about\nthe impact I want Silhouette to have is\nthe sextock ratio. I kind of want to get\nthose to feature parody so that dexes\nare trading as much if not more, uh, value\nthan centralized exchanges. I think the\nthe value proposition for for that for\njust kind of like access to markets\nmakes so much more sense, and you know,\npushes the the frontier of DeFi a lot\nmore, and then the the mechanisms that we\nneed to do to get there, like, you know,\nwe need to have features like privacy\nbeing built out. So having Silhouette\nbeing a forcing function for for that\noutcome, I think is really, really\nimportant and be an attraction for net\nnew capital into the entire crypto\necosystem, to not only kind of then\nchallenge, um, how markets get developed\nwith within like the sex side of the\nworld, but have folks like on the on the\ntraditional finance side kind of take a\nbit more interest in these the crypto\nmarket as an asset class and kind of\nbuild their own kind of mechanisms of\nbringing their capital into crypto. They'll\nnaturally go through the centralized\nexchanges and custodians first. Um, and\nso the gateway into that market is\ndefinitely through the custodians, but\nhave really seamless native integrations\nwith the the current kind of folks that\nare in, uh, folks that are managing\ninstitutional funds.\nAll right. Well, what an exciting\nvision. We'll see if it takes place. Uh,\nthat's all we have for today. I want to\nthank China for joining this episode.\nAnd as a reminder, Unus works tirelessly\nto get you accurate, informed crypto\nnews. If you want to stay ahead, read\nThe Block. Thanks, and see you next\ntime.\n",
