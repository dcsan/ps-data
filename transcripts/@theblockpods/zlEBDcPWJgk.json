  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHello and welcome to the Cryptobe. My name is Tim Copeland, The Block's head of growth. Joining me today, we have the co-founder of Across Protocol, Hart Lambur. Welcome to the show. How are you doing? Hey Tim, thanks for having me. Doing great. Really appreciate you having me on. Brilliant. Before we get started, just a quick note. If you're hiring in crypto, you should check out Campus. Out of all of your candidates, help you pick out the real crypto native hires. Head to theblock.co/campus to get a 3-month free trial. Now today's episode is about going cross-chain. So what is a cross-chain protocol in a nutshell?\n\nA cross-chain protocol is, colloquially, it's known as a fast bridge. A way to move assets like really quickly within a couple seconds between blockchains. What we more technically, it's this intent-based bridging protocol where we sort of shortcut traditional bridges and use third-party actors, which we'll get into, called relay solvers or market makers to front you assets to just basically make two chains seem like they're seamlessly connected. If it's enabling swaps that are that fast, are there any compromises that you make in order to do that, or have you just, you know, found this amazing solution?\n\nWell, there are trade-offs, right? So, I mean, it's worth the way I typically like to kind of frame it is, okay, I got two blockchains. I'll link it A and B. I'll call it Arbitrum and Base. And these two blockchains are not really connected. They're connected through Ethereum, but they're connected through Ethereum through like a 7-day bridge technically. And some other blockchains, you know, aren't connected at all. And you want to like move assets between the two of them. How do you do it? So, I mean, backing up and kind of giving a framework here, the naive way of how you would connect these two blockchains is you like maybe have a pool of assets on chain A. You send something to a contract on chain A, and then some message gets sent over to chain B, and then assets get released on chain B. And you could maybe those assets are burnt on one chain and minted on the other, and you're introducing like security assumptions there, or maybe you have like pools of assets on both sides. But the general problem with that is you have to like send this message for each transfer, and that message is slow. Not only because like you have to send the message, but you also can't send that message until you have a sense of finality on the origin chain. So more precisely, it's like if that message is like wrong on the origin chain, you end up just like poof creating money on the destination chain, and the whole thing breaks. So a lot of bridges, a lot of traditional bridges, they're relatively slow here because of this problem, because like you can't just poof create assets, and like, you know, the asset issuer just like loses money. So like what's the solution here? What's the trade-off? The intent-based approach does something different. So on chain A, we take the user's assets and we put them into basically an escrow contract. So they're locked up, and then we start a race for third-party solvers who are going to go and fill the user on the destination chain with their own money, and those solvers are going to be the ones that take on the reorg or finality risk. But they're sophisticated actors. They know how to price this. They know what that risk is, and they race to fill the user with their own money. User gets filled, like L2 to L2 or like two-second fill times. User gets filled extremely quickly on the destination chain, and they move on with their day, and then the protocol will like verify the fill happened before it releases the user assets back to the solver. So basically, we're introducing like third-party semi-sophisticated actors to provide this like liquidity network that connects these chains and does it very quickly. Does that make any sense?\n\nYeah. How does it work in terms of them filling the assets? Like if I'm a solver and I see this person, you know, that there's opportunity there, do I just send them my money and hope I'm first? Like, you know, like obviously that that's a stupid idea. So, I assume it works differently. It's sort of stupid, but sort of not. Like, in essence, like if you and I are both solvers and we see an opportunity, so Jordan, your producer, right? He wants to send money from A to B. He puts money in chain A. And we're like, \"Okay, cool. Let's go race.\" There's a contract on chain B that you and I are both going to try to be first to send money through. So, we're just going to send money through this contract to Jordan, but like it's the transaction's nons. So, we like know it's Jordan's transaction, and the first one of us to send a money gets the fee associated with that bridge. The second person just doesn't get to, like the transaction will revert and it won't let them send money through. So, okay. Yeah, you're kind of right. We're basically just racing. And like we can go a lot deeper and should we be competing on speed? Should we be competing on price? Should we be competing on a combination of the two of them? It can get really interesting on how you structure this, but the high-level argument is like, yeah, we're going to see who has the first person to be able to do this according to the constraints of the quote unquote intent, what you know, the user is intending to do. First person wins.\n\nInteresting. It sort of seems kind of similar to TransferWise, or I believe they're now called Wise, where like they like instead of swapping money, they'll just have buckets on each side and then they just reallocate on each side, and that just avoids actually swapping the chain. There's a lot of kind of examples that relate to, yeah, TransferWise, even like traditional remittance, like Western Union, like way old school business. Western Union, you go in the UK and you want to send money to the Philippines, you like give them money, they're not doing an international wire transfer to the Philippines, which is expensive and crazy slow. Instead, they're going to like send the user in the Philippines money, and then later on they'll rebalance between their bank accounts in the Philipp, they'll do thousands of these, and then they'll rebalance once a week between their bank account in the Philippines and the bank account in the UK and send like a wire transfer. And like that analogy, Tim, is actually pretty close to what a cross and intent-based bridges are doing with all the traditional, like the slow canonical bridges in Ethereum. So if we go back to our example with like Base and Arbitrum, I can connect those two chains canonically using a 7-day bridge. It's just really slow. So the solvers are doing this like fast thing with their own money between the chains, and then they're using the slow bridges or maybe centralized exchanges or whatever other method they want to rebalance those assets periodically.\n\nWho decides the fee? Do they get to choose their own fees? Like how does that work? Really good question. The fee right now is set by the protocol. I mean, technically the user can type in whatever fee they want, but solvers might not like fill them. They might say that's too low, which does happen. But the fee is set by the protocol that's saying here's what we think the market clearing rate is for this route. And solvers are competing on that. Lots of ideas on how we can like ek more performance by having an auction there too, you know, like, hey, what is the, let's have solvers compete. But again, it's kind of interesting. Do we, are we preferencing costs or speed right now? Like right now we're having everybody race to fill for a set fee versus trying to fill at the lowest possible price. There's potentially cool ways in the relatively near future we might do both. But yeah, that that's the way it's working today. And it works pretty well because the fees are so low, like the costs here are really pretty microscopic that the costs aren't really the issue. Instead, what Across and intent-based systems, I think, are what we're really delivering that's like the unique value prop is speed. Like how do we make these two chains feel like one by connecting them in two seconds?\n\nAre you finding much success in terms of number of, like, I guess amount of money flowing through the protocol compared to other bridging solutions? Yeah. We are. I think Across has been around for a few years now. Sort of really two-ish years ago was when I think we started growing rapidly. And we are, like one of, if, depending on how you look at it, like the most used bridge for moving Ethereum around by volume. But we actually, and it's worth digging into, we're much more focused on the number of transactions we do, because there's a few big transactions that move huge volume, which is great, but for the vast, vast majority of users, you know, using Ethereum, using web3, they're not moving around million-dollar transfers or $2 million trades, they're moving around, you know, 100 bucks, 500 bucks, 10 grand. The median transfer size that we see is about 100 bucks right now, and that's like the sweet spot. So we are really dominating in the number of transfers we're sending between these chains and seeing a lot of traction there. And did you have any experience with this sort of, as you shifted into crypto? I know you worked like Goldman Sachs for quite a few years, an investor. Like how did you end up doing this?\n\nYeah. Okay. So going back, like the first thing I did out of college was work as a bond trader, like treasury bond trader at Goldman. Did that in New York for eight years during the financial crisis. And there are actually some analogies towards how Across works versus how bond trading works here too. If you think of the treasury market, you have customers that are going to go ask primary dealers. So Goldman, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, whatever else, they asked them like, \"Hey, where can I sell a 100 million 10-year treasuries?\" Like this was literally my job, and it's a request for quote style system where the solvers or the solvers, the trading desks compete to say, here Tim, my price is this, and you know, Deutsche Bank says their price is that, and you say, okay, I'm going to trade with Goldman, they gave me the best price. And this kind of request for quote style system is sort of what's going on in Across here in some ways. It's kind of like the on-chain version of it where that kind of like TradFi version, the rules are ambiguous, like you can kind of, they're a little squishy, the rules, which leads to people accusing each other of like doing bad things, and effectively in Across, we've taken a lot of those concepts, said, okay, instead of it being, you know, trading desks, we've got solvers, and the rules are completely transparent and clear on chain, and we can have this like fair and efficient competition to solve this problem of connecting these chains.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. And you mentioned Intents earlier. Obviously, this was quite a big discussion point sort of over like the last year or so. What, like how do you use them, or at least like what are you trying to enable with them? Lots, lots to unpack there. So, we are in many ways the original Intents protocol, or at least the original Intents protocol that got used. And so I've had a, I've done a lot to push this, this kind of concept. Our team has done a lot to push this concept forward. And like what does this sort of buzzword mean? I mean, I don't want it to be a buzzword. I want it to be real. It just basically means like, hey, what are you trying to do? What is the outcome you want on the destination chain? If the outcome I want is I want, I want to like, I'm starting here with like 50 USDC on chain A, and I want as much USDC as I can on chain B. Okay, cool. My intent is give me max USDC on chain B. If my outcome is I actually want to take my max USDC and deposit into a, that I can specify too. And the intent concept basically works really, really well in this multi-chain world where I can say what I'm looking to do is have this action, this, this transaction completed on this destination chain. Who wants to do it for me? And that's that's the core concept. So we, and when you have this multi-chain world, in order to make this be fast, there really is no other architecture than having these solvers compete to do that action. So we, we put together a standard for this, ERC7683. None of your readers are going to remember 7683, but that's the listeners, I should say, that's the number. We wrote this with Uniswap, co-authored this standard with Uniswap, and it's been actually really pretty broadly adopted as a standard specification for how to like create and specify these cross-chain Intents.\n\nAnd then how does that work for the user? Is it that you go on to like a website and it's and it sort of gives you options? It's like you put drop-down list, you say I want to swap this to this and this protocol and this chain, or is it like text space? You just write it out. Like what's that, what's that experience like? So the front-end experience can kind of be any of those things. What the user technically does is sign a message that specifies their intent on the origin chain. So all they have to do is like sign a message on the origin chain. How you, that that says here's what I want to do on the destination chain. Practically speaking, like if you go to the Across front end today, across.2, it looks like a bridge. You say I want to move 100 USDC from A to B, from Arbitrum to Base. You like click the buttons, 100 A to B, hit send, and you sign a message, and that's where the int, the intent is created by the app. But like, yeah, we've got like hackathons where people do the same thing in text form. I type out natural language. Here's what I want to do. That gets interpreted probably by like an LLM. Here's the user's intent. They sign that message, and they, they send it to the same network of solvers that we have today to go and like build that. There's stuff we can talk about too once we like move into this world of like smart contracts everywhere, which is happening nowish in Ethereum with with the Pectra hard fork and this upgrade called 7702. So, we're, we're going to have the ability where user's intent could be here is the action.\n\n\nIt's the permission to action I want to execute on the destination chain.\nAnd my intent is basically who wants to, here's my signed message that proves I want to do this action in this smart contract wallet.\nUm, who here wants to go and fill it?\nSo, it's pretty flexible, but it all distills back into a user has a transaction they want to have happen on the destination chain.\nThe intent is the way to uh to specify that.\nAnd how far before all of this is completely hidden under the hood in a very nice user experience?\nLike, are people building apps where the sort of, you know, the user, maybe it's a vault product or something, and then behind the scenes it then has all of this puts into Ave on this chain and all of that happens behind the scenes?\nYeah, it's happening.\nUm, you know, Uniswap integrated Across in a way that lets you do crushing bridging in a way that you like the user doesn't really see because the intents are being specified behind the scenes.\nIt's probably like our the biggest most broadly used example of it.\nBut there's lots and lots of this.\nUm, there's other like yield protocols that also say, hey, I need to have this deposit on Ethereum, but I want to make it accessible to the user to make this deposit from all the other L2s.\nAnd so you can imagine that they integrate Across to just say my intent here is to, I'm starting from Arbitrum, but I want to end up with this vault deposit on Ethereum mainnet.\nIt's like a perfect use case.\nUm, where I think this should go in many ways is it does go to the wallet level where wallets make it easy for applications.\nThey don't have to actually even like developers don't even have to specify any of this.\nThe wallet's just going to be like, \"Hey, you're trying to execute this transaction on chain X and you don't actually have money on chain X, but I'm going to make it so you can pay for that transaction from chain A and all you have to do is like click this button.\"\nUm, so maybe like the right mental model to push to the listeners and viewers is like, I've been toying with this a little bit.\nThink of it as like uh like like it's like a checkout at Amazon where I'm trying to buy something.\nThe thing I'm trying to buy here is a transaction on a specific chain.\nUm, but my payment options are I pay for it on A, I, B, pay for it on B, I pay for it on C, like whatever my payments options are.\nAnd and I think the right experience is the wallet is going to abstract away and show you the payment option that makes the most sense uh for you.\nSo the developer doesn't have to do a thing.\nThe developer is just there.\nIt's like, here's what I want my application to do.\nUm, and the user also doesn't have to overthink it.\nThe wallet is just being like, \"Hey user, you're trying to do this thing.\nUh, here's the best way to pay for it.\"\nHow long do you think until those apps are, you know, available and widely used?\nWhat wallets do is hard to predict here, right?\nUm, I think that we'll have examples of this like very, very soon.\nWe kind of already, we have a proof of concept that we can throw around that sort of already does this too.\nUm, but it's hard to know.\nI, I personally don't exactly know how wallets are going to evolve.\nLike, is it going to be wallets like MetaMask, Mask, and Phantom?\nUm, or is it going to be more of these like embedded smart wallets um that get used?\nAnd how do those wallets uh like look at some of this chain abstraction stuff?\nI'm not totally sure.\nSo, it's like very good point.\nLike internally on our team, we're trying to make Across easy to use in our front end like as a traditional bridge.\nWe're also trying to make it easy for integrators like DApps to integrate Across in their application because they don't want to like wait around for wallets to decide things.\nAnd then we want to talk to wallets.\nWe are talking to wallets about like, hey, how could you integrate this much more deeply into your wallet experience so it's like totally disappears.\nI expect that happens in the next, you know, year or two.\nA year in crypto is a long time, but uh it's very hard to predict.\nDo you think it could help new people like get into crypto if you finally get to this point where it's actually quite easy to access?\nBecause obviously, you know, there's things like DeFi yields that crypto, you know, natives are able to access.\nThey're a little bit more complicated to, you know, to understand and get into.\nUm, but do you think this sort of thing could be a way for people to find crypto more compelling?\nI mean, 100%.\nEverything like needs to happen.\nUm, your bottleneck right now is still going to be how do I get my first crypto in the first place?\nSo, there's like the fiat on-ramp problem.\nUm, and we're not the ones solving that.\nAnd I think that's still a lot of centralized exchanges.\nBut like once I have some crypto, it's in some wallet.\nAnd I want like the thing I tell my team is like users just want to click buttons and have things happen, right?\nUm, and that's the vision we should be pushing towards and every people are.\nSo I'll have some money in crypto wallet.\nI click a button.\nThe thing happens happens quickly, instantly, you know, at least sub two seconds cheaply.\nI'm not thinking about what chain that stuff's on.\nI'm not even really thinking about what asset it is uh necessarily.\nAnd I'm just able to click around, use these DApps, it works quickly and cheaply.\nI was just thinking that it's kind of there is a bit of a let's say use an exchange to um buy crypto, but then there's these other platforms that you then have to move to and obviously, you know, that often requires like using private uh public addresses and sending money that way.\nI did wonder like at what point could you see platforms linking up in a way where you almost connect your the two platforms together and then within that you can send and it handles the actual sending of the funds on the back end?\nLike, do you think projects would ever work together like that or do you think, yeah, I think projects will work, like, okay, this is this is an interesting question.\nI don't really know.\nThis is not necessarily where I thought our conversation would go, but it's it's like protocols, DeFi protocols, I think want to work together.\nLike, everybody has incentive.\nWe want like more people to self-custody crypto or have crypto in wallets.\nUm, centralized exchanges have different incentives.\nCentralized exchanges like want to keep your money on the centralized exchange.\nSo they have a delicate dance here where I think the centralized exchanges realize that if they don't offer any ability to get into web 3, they're going to like lose users.\nThey have to um and I think some some exchanges like Coinbase truly do, I think, believe in like an onchain future and that's their gateway um or that's their their vision.\nUm, but generally speaking, like the centralized exchanges kind of want you to just keep your money um on the exchange and trade assets back and forth.\nThat's like how they make money.\nAnd so I'm bullish that in the sort of more friendly regulatory environment we have, there will be more fiat on-ramps that will let users get money in and then you in ways that aren't just through centralized exchanges.\nUm, and they'll work better and they'll be more robust and it'll be like social acceptable and all this other kind of stuff.\nUm, and then I think you're looking at like a great future here.\nUm, and then of course there's many parts of the world where like stable coins are becoming an increasingly dominant way of actually paying people.\nAnd so that's great too.\nLike then you've kind of sidestepped that whole problem as well.\nYeah.\nCoinbase is quite clever because they're moving people into crypto, but typically that's onto the base network where they make sequence of fees, so they kind of profit from it anyway.\nGood business.\nYeah.\nSo, um, maybe I guess moving on to some more like general questions.\nWhat's one crypto project obviously other than your own that you've been trying out recently?\nUm, I do play, I mean, it's probably a pretty mid answer, but I do play with Hyperliquid.\nI think it's pretty interesting right now.\nUm, you know, as a market maker, I think some of the stuff they're doing around just transparency and onchain liquidity is super fascinating.\nUm, don't totally know where it goes, but um I I like the vision of an onchain Binance.\nI like that.\nUm uh I also Oh, you know, in the same vein, Uniswap is a project that I've known for a very, very long time since like basically day one.\nAnd I think that they're also kind of like the UX friendly version.\nI I I would like Uniswap to become also like an onchain Binance Uni.\nSo I think those are really interesting kind of Yeah.\nYeah.\nHow do you think Uni Chain's going?\nIt's going okay.\nUm uh full disclosure, I'm I'm on the board of the Uniswap Foundation, so uh I'm biased here.\nUh but, uh uh I I think it's going okay.\nUm I think some of the recent growth is pretty good.\nUm I think having uh a home for Uniswap liquidity makes a lot of does make a lot of sense.\nUm, and yeah, I'm I would love to see Uni Chain become like another onchain Binance that gives you gives users an ability to trade like all the assets without the hurdles of like okay, did this exchange list this asset?\nLike it's permissionless in that regard.\nI think that's huge.\nUm I'll it becomes like a very transparent scalable architecture for exchange of all of these assets that crypto is creating.\nHow competitive do you think it is with Hyperliquid?\nI mean, I guess one element is I wouldn't say I'm an expert here, but Hyperliquid obviously sort of is is for the very sort of experienced traders, whereas Uniswap, as far as I understand it, is more typically for your more basic swaps and I don't know if they have the same sort of level of experience.\nUm user experience, I guess, but in theory they could have now they have their own chain, they could have a similar sort of product to Hyperliquid.\nI think, you know, Uniswap, knowing the team well, they care a lot about execution and I think um uh the designs they keep pushing forward really do continuously improve the execution in a uh like a automated market maker sense.\nUm, and you know, you go back over the history of Uniswap when they first came out, people thought it was an idiotic idea.\nThere's like there's no way this like automated market maker is going to provide good liquidity.\nUm, and maybe they're kind of right in V1 and V2.\nAnd then V3 came along and you're like, okay, holy like the concentrated liquidity market here is giving better pricing on like the ETH USDC pair than Binance had.\nIt was pretty wild.\nUm, and yeah, so I do agree with your like high level take that Hyperliquid comes across as more for the pros and Uniswap is a little bit more friendly in their vibe.\nUm, but I also do think under the scenes the mechanism design of uh some of those protocols is like really cool and will allow for really great um execution.\nAnd you know, we take a lot of uh this is the stuff we care a lot about at Across too.\nWe're like, okay, hey, we're not an exchange like Hyperliquid or uh or Uniswap.\nBut when we start connecting assets between chains, we like kind of are.\nIt's a little bit different.\nAnd we want to design the mechanisms that allow for like this super efficient, seamless flow of value between these chains really instantly and like with really, really quickly.\nAnd we like Hyperliquid can't do this because it's a single chain, right?\nBut Across is a very, very interesting place in this world of how do you in this world where you have many chains, there's going to be needs to move assets between these chains uh potentially a huge need and if what our goal is is to become the venue for absolute best execution using kind of like all the tricks that the same the single chain players are doing, but figuring out how we do this in a cross-chain way too.\nAnd where are we in the market right now?\nThis is a bull or a bear market.\nOh man.\nUh, my macro views are all over the place uh here.\nUm, I am Tim, like I am a as a treasury bond trader at Goldman, like I do have a little bit of a macro bias towards like, hey, the US dollar has been like reserve currency.\nUm, and I do think some of the policy decisions are sort of threatening that.\nUm, I don't think people are going to be like dumping US dollars, but I think they may, I think institutional investors may shy away from them, which may make a difference.\nI think that that's like very bearish risk markets generally.\nUm, but I think it could be quite bullish crypto and like Bitcoin in particular.\nUm, I do think we're in an environment where Bitcoin is an amazing asset that uh if if it's risk on everywhere, Bitcoin will do well.\nAnd if it's like de-dollarification, I actually think Bitcoin can do pretty well, too.\nSo, I'm I'm like I see a lot of macro reasons to own major crypto assets, but I don't know whether that means we're in a bull or bear market.\nI think we're in a weird market right now.\nYeah.\nAnd any thoughts on whether strategies Bitcoin accumulation will end up blowing up and taking the market with it?\nI do worry about that.\nUm, I I think the financial engineering behind strategy, MicroStrategy and the copycats is interesting.\nUm, I do have in my own experience watching financial markets when like things don't go up forever.\nUm, and so I do worry about that.\nI I I think some of it's very, again, I'll take a very like modest view here that uh uh I like that we've got more people going into Bitcoin.\nI like more buying of Bitcoin.\nI like more buying of ETH.\nI think that's super cool.\nThe Ethereum version of it, Sharplink, I think is pretty interesting.\nUm, but uh I worry that there will be uh at some point, maybe far in the future, there will be like some stresses that do cause some force selling of crypto and I don't like force selling of crypto because I own it and I want it to go up.\nSo, it's fair.\nUh, do you think mind share platforms like Kaido are helping or hurting the vibes?\nI think Kaido is super cool and super interesting.\nI think it's natural to kind of financialize mind share to some extent.\nI think that's a lot of that's the the secular trend in everything we're working on where uh financialization has been happening for 50 plus years and it's going to keep going.\nUm, I do think that\n\n\nTwitter is full of bots and gills now, which is hard to navigate.\nSo, and I just think generally speaking, we're going to get better and better filters with all of our LLM friends.\nUm, I think the more people, the more real people are actually writing their views, uh, the better.\nUh, but, uh, uh, I think it's hard to filter through the noise right now.\nDo you think platforms like Ethos might be able to help with that?\nI'm not really familiar with them.\nFor context, reputation platform.\nBasically, it's a review-based platform.\nI, I have there's so much going on, man.\nI can't track all the all the all the things all the time.\nSo, I'll try to be real when I'm like, \"Yeah, don't really not deep on that one.\"\nNo worries.\nAnd are you surprised to see Pumped Fund raising a billion dollars?\nUm, no.\nI think uh it's smart.\nUm, and so I wish them I mean, wish them luck.\nUh, yeah.\nI think it's going to\nYeah, I I wish them luck.\nI I don't love everything about Pumped Up Fun, but um you know, you got to be super impressed by their uh user acquisition.\nIt's pretty wild.\nAwesome.\nAll right.\nWell, that's what we have for today.\nUh I want to thank Heart for joining this episode.\nAnd as a reminder, Unusual works tirelessly to get you accurate, informed crypto news.\nYou want to stay ahead with the block.\nThanks.\nWe'll see you next time.\nThanks.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
