  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHello and welcome to The Big Brain Podcast. I'm your co-host Larry Surma, president of The Block, and I'm joined by Namik, the chief strategy officer of Megath. Today we have one of the most interesting visionary builders in crypto, Paolo of Tether. Would you like to introduce yourself?\n\nHey guys, thank you very much for having me. It's always a big pleasure to be hosted by The Block. I am Paolo Ardoino. I am the CEO of Tether. Coming a long way. First senior developer at Bitfinex, CTO at Bitfinex, CTO at Tether, and then CEO at Tether since 2023. I'm a technologist, I'm a nerd, a developer coding for almost all my life. I think 32 years of coding now, and I like just to build stuff and do things that you know, others don't do and maybe don't care about, but my entire vision is building technology that resists the wrath of God and that helps the humans in the worst-case scenario rather than, you know, just building something that can only survive in the best-case scenario. That's kind of me in a nutshell.\n\n[Music]\nI remember Paolo, and you and I talked the first time Bitfinex, you know, obviously was well, Tether is specifically, but Bitfinex as well. You guys were having some issues. You just issued LEO, and now we're here, you know, a few years later, and you're probably one of the most profitable companies in the world. Just made $13 billion last year in profit for Tether, and you know, probably one of the most important companies in crypto and maybe even in the world when it comes to what you guys are trying to accomplish. So how do we get from that point where it was kind of one of the lower points of your journey and you know, you starting to become more public to now visiting Wall Street and Washington and you know, so much growth that you guys have seen? How has that been over the last four or five years?\n\nLook, the entire crypto industry was and is still fairly new. I still believe that we are early. Tether created in 2014 this thing called stablecoin, and for 11 years, really no one cared about that, and this year, suddenly, 2025 is named the year of stablecoins. The most powerful government in the world is building, is creating law that will regulate the technology that that are created. So that's quite exciting. I mean, the road to get there has been a little bit bumpy. When you are in a new industry, when actually you create a new industry, it's not easy to get everything perfect, also because you pissed off a lot of people, especially in the banking sector. So, you know, sure, we had some roadblocks and bumps along the way, but you know, when you have to fight with a global traditional financial system, it's never easy, and I think that the biggest kudos goes to our team because they never back down, they never stop, they never stop believing in the mission of building, of bringing a dollar to hundreds of millions of people that have been left behind by that traditional banking system. And yeah, I mean, I've been personally going into United States. For me, I mean, I'm 40, this is the first year for me that I decided to go into United States. Before, I never had the opportunity, and you know, it's quite remarkable because past administration was, you know, it created this operation chalkpoint 2.0, and the OCC was very against stablecoins and the bank, and then, and you know, was directing banks to be against all the crypto companies, and then you had the Senator Warren writing letters to all the auditors saying that they shouldn't touch crypto companies with a 10-foot pole, and now just in a few months, we are seeing a huge positive change at least in the respect of crypto. So, and I've been going in the United States and talking to the Hill and to the administration to explain why stablecoins are very important, but not only for United States. The way I try to describe it is that the United States are now trying to pass a law on stablecoins. That is great, especially dollar-based stablecoins because they are, you know, really very important, but they are much more important outside the United States rather than inside the United States. The simple way I try to describe it is that you can imagine United States having the financial rails 90% perfect and efficient. So the US has the best financial rails in the world and has the best efficiency of money in the world. So they could, you could say that there are 90% complete. If you add stablecoins on top of that, you can get to 90 per 95% perfection because, you know, money will become even faster, you know, more transparent, and then, you know, you can program money, right? That's great. But it's from 90 to 95%. So you get towards that 99.9% perfection. That is, you know, insanely better than anywhere else in the world. If you take Nigeria, you could say that the efficiency of money is 10, 20%. So if you add stablecoins on top of that, it gets to 50%. So stablecoins are much, have much bigger impact outside the United States rather than inside the United States. As simple as that is pure math and logic to me. And you know what, on the Hill, I'm trying to explain that, you know, the regulation should also take a look at and and provide proper safeguards for foreign issuers like USDT is a foreign foreign stablecoin to United States, but nevertheless, it's not less important, actually, is more important also for the dollar geming and purchasing US treasuries and the depth that we're going probably to talk about later.\n\nDo you see a world in which the US ever issues their own stablecoin?\n\nYeah, I look, I think that the US tried to or like US lawmakers try to ban the possibility of creating a CBDC. I think that the success of USDT shows that also privately issued stablecoins can be very, very helpful to United States. In the end, basically, we are using most of the reserves to buy back the US debt, right? So, and it's all very transparent as a process. We keep our treasury bills in counterfeit Gerald that is a primary dealer is a US institution. So I think that they can have very strong and and and deep scrutiny in what we are doing even if we are a private company.\n\nIt's really important for the US from the perspective that you just mentioned, but also like you said, it's really beneficial for countries where maybe inflation is just is just really difficult. You tweeted something recently where there was a store that's now quoting prices in USDT. What are some examples that you've seen and that someone has shared with you where USDT is just helping people, you know, to get access to normal stable money without being so reliant on the local government, and do you think that's just going to be become more and more common in the future?\n\nSo, I mean, I wish I could say that USDT has become very successful because we were perfect and beautiful and great, but actually, it's the insuccess of entire economies that made the success of USDT. That's kind of like just a quick parenthesis, but it's kind of almost in a way saddening to think that, you know, this, the success of one of your product is directly proportional to the insuccess of some emerging markets, economies, you know, from a human perspective, I think about this a lot. And but on the other side, I think that, you know, if there was no USDT, all the populations in these countries would be having a worse time. So if you think about Turkey, where the inflation in Turkey is 50% last year was 50% year-over-year, or and the the Turkish leader lost 80% of its value against the US dollar in the last few years. In Argentina, the Argentinian pays a loss like 90 plus percent of its value against the US dollar in last few years, and Argentina defaulted multiple times, you could see why people are resorting to USDT. You know, one of the crazy things, because when you run a company where the success of its main product happened organically, if you look at the chart of USDT growth, it grew, started growing dramatically from 2020 to 2022, and then 2023 and 4 were huge as well, and also this year. But until 2020, when US was only used in the crypto market, the usage was good but limited. The growth was, you know, four to six billion up to early 2020, maybe 7, 8, but that was the cap. Then something happened, and again, we went back and look at what happened and trying to learn from the growth of USDT because it was organic, so it was not dependent on something we did, so it's very important that you, you know, you try to go in retrospect. So what we learned is that in the emerging markets, in developing countries, there are a couple of things that are very common. One is the high use of smartphones, and so, even if a country is poor, does not mean that necessarily is poorly equipped when it comes to smartphones and and and connectivity necessarily. And so on the other side, you have also lower average age for population. So what we learned, and in a way is very touching to me, from 2017 to 2020 in the emerging markets, is the young kids that learn crypto the fastest, and that is fairly normal, but all the young populations, the young generations are more prone to learn new things. But if you, if in your country, there are much more kids than other countries, these kids will become very important for basically the adoption of any new technology. But in 2020 with the advent of the pandemic, these kids were looking at their parents that were losing their jobs, and they were trying to protect their families. These parents were trying to do what what they could to to protect their families in one of the worst moments of the recent history of humanity. And the parents were even with the pandemic, they were still going out in the streets to buy cash dollars in the black market because they have been doing that for the past 20 years. But there was the pandemic. So it became even more dangerous. It's already was already super inefficient because, you know, these cash dollars were priced quite higher, but still was even more dangerous. So what happened is that the kids for the first time was were the kids that were teaching to the parents that they could keep dollars, digital dollars on their smartphone without having to leave home, and that is what bootstrapped the usage of USDT in all the emerging markets were kids teaching to their parents, you know, kids learning from each other on Discord and then teaching to their parents how to use and hold a digital dollar without putting themselves in danger. So that is very humbling to me and is crazy. And we just learned it very recently because again, we went back and learned about it.\n\n[Music]\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on Tether Gold and the role it will play in these emerging markets as well. Right. You highlighted the fact that like in a country like Turkey, which you know, I have a fair share of experience in, the country's been riddled with hyperinflation. Crypto has emerged as one really, you know, strong alternative as a way of life, but a lot of people are asking questions around, okay, what if we were to revert back to like, you know, gold-backed financial systems, and I know you guys have Tether Gold as a product in that vertical. I'd love to hear some of the fraud processes behind it and what you see as the future for a gold-backed stablecoin or gold-backed product of any sort.\n\nSo I like to be very pragmatic and logic in everything that we build at Tether in the scale of quality and perfection as a tool or as an asset. The lowest ranking is fiat currencies. Then US dollar is the best fiat currency. Then to me, on top of best of the, you know, US dollar, there is gold, and then on top of everything, there is Bitcoin. Right? So to me, gold is the best tokenized asset in the world because for the last 5,000 years, humanity has been using gold as a currency. And you know, gold cannot be inflated. Sure, you know, you can say that if gold price goes to 100k per ounce, then you could try to go to Mars or well, not to Mars, but on an asteroid and trying to mine gold from that asteroid and all that, right? It all depends from incentives. It's almost like game theory, but you could say that it's very, I think that the supply of gold will slowly and state and increase with a small inflation over the next years, but will not double, triple in a matter of one year or two years or a decade very easily. I think it's very, very improbable. So compared to other like to all the national currencies that are driven by, you know, decisions of humans. So the beauty of Bitcoin to me is that is the only currency that is governed by math. Then gold and math is the only certainty in the universe. Then gold is the only currency that is governed by nature and is very hard to change nature even for humans. And then all the rest is like going downhill from there. So we created that gold because that was actually the best product that we could create outside of Bitcoin, and if you think about it, is a product that could part of our returns on USDT because we cannot make money on gold. But since someone will do it eventually, then it's best if we do it rather than let someone else doing it. Also, I know for a fact that the BRICS countries are kind of announced that they will issue a digital currency backed by gold. Look at the gold price from in the last 3 years, like it went more than 2x. So the reason why it happened is because BRICS countries are going to launch a digital currency backed by gold, and they are building infrastructure in Africa, in central South America, and other parts of Asia. So imagine BRICS countries with this new currency, they will have all the people working the infrastructures they built all around the world starting using this digital currency backed by gold that is actually quite a cool currency in a certain sense because it's not the yuan, is not a Russian rubble, is backed by gold, so it's quite appealing, especially in the emerging markets because the emerging markets have the highest attention for gold. So in a certain way, they decided, it's almost like the BRICS decided to compete with the US dollar, not with a basket of their own currencies. I think that they wanted at the beginning, but they realized that they that was a bad idea, and now they will try to compete with a gold-backed currency. So, it's best if Tether does it and provides an alternative to what the BRICS countries are going to issue in parallel to, you know, keep leading on with USDT.\n\nYou know, it's interesting. I would argue that you and Tether are the largest exporters of American soft power in the world. Now you're front running a world in which gold ends up being this shared asset in the BRICS markets. So I want to touch on the point I just made around the role of Tether in effectively fleshing out US hegemony around the world. Right. So I think we're in a very interesting geopolitical landscape. We've had an unprecedented 20 years of globalization, which was very much pushed by the US, but I think we can\n\n\nAll agree that there is an end of an era happening. Right? The US is becoming much more isolationist, for better or for worse. That's a uh, that's a strategic decision, while China is actually expanding. Um, in many ways, I see Tether as one of the, like, you know, you're one of the largest holders of, um, you know, T-bills in the world, but I'm I'm curious to hear how you see the role of Tether in these emerging markets as a way of, like, enforcing Western democracy and just like Western values.\nVery good point. I think that the ultimate social network is money. Tether kind of created three, three things. Well, created a stablecoin, and the effect is three-fold. Tether is the company that was able to successfully, or at least in part, successfully, uh, bring financial inclusion to emerging markets. One of the things that annoys me the most, um, is how the hell a small company like Tether was able to do more than NGOs and charities and other organizations that raise a lot of money to bring financial inclusion. I mean, if you are beaten by a couple of Italians, then you have a big problem. I believe that that has to be said. It's so financial inclusion to hundreds of millions of people and growing. Um, second is, um, the fact that we have been expanding the US dollar, Germany, and I think that is, uh, is, is clear. Tether has millions of physical touch points in the emerging markets. So these, these touch points vary from chains of bodegas in Central and South America with, you know, tens or hundreds of thousands of shops that, you know, sell phone credit and all that, and you know, or like newspapers, newsstands, like we, those are great ways to deal with people and and interact with people where you know, you can also offer education, you can offer products. Any product can be offered through these chains of bodegas. Same in Africa, since there are, there is less infrastructure to acquire. We are, you know, Africa has this problem of low electricity penetration. So around 600 million people over on, on 1.4 billion people, 600 million people have no electricity at home, but yet they have smartphones and and few and different equipment. So what we are doing is building kiosks in Africa in small villages with, um, solar panels on top, and inside we are, we have rechargeable batteries that we are offer with a subscription of three USDT per month, and so we are teaching how to open Bitcoin and USDT wallets. Right now, we did a pilot in Africa, and we have already 500 of these kiosks. We have 500,000 people using these batteries and more than 10 million battery, actually, it's probably quite more than that now, but more 10 million battery swaps. So these kiosks are becoming the center of commerce of the, the, the village, and, um, you know, with the remittances going to this through, through these kiosks, then to the wallet installed through these kiosks. I mean, that's a way to, we, one of the many ways we, we work to expand, you know, our distribution channel with the boots on the ground, and by 20 and 2026, we plan to have 10,000 kiosks, and by end 2030, we plan to have 100,000 kiosks so that we can pretty much power up 30 million households in, in Africa. And that, by the way, is a change that we will see from space, because like the center of Africa is, is very dark, but you know, if we light it up, if you can see it from space. But on top of that, we basically, we are building the biggest distribution network in the world, and I completely agree with you, Namik, that, uh, the world is going towards a localization from a globalization, right? And if you remember, like in the past, in the past, uh, decade or so, if you were a company and had a physical distribution network, would have told you sell it and rent it back, and we did basically the opposite. So actually, we built the distribution network so that now, you know, sorry to say, I mean, look at the S1 from Circle, um, you know, we, we, we don't have to pay for the distribution, so we built our own distribution.\nAnd to double click on that, Paolo, what have you found on the ground in terms of people? What do they actually care about? Is it just access to money, and they don't care about any of the rails? They just care about, hey, I can send this to one of my friends and pay him for something. What's kind of been the thought process and some of the takeaways that you have from these physical locations that you now have in Africa?\nSo they really don't care about blockchain. They, they just care about the, the fact that they, the fees are basically zero or almost zero. So we have recommended through our education different wallets, and we work with partners, and, uh, you know, honestly, we are very agnostic, but we realize that, you know, the problem is that most of the wallets are trying to sell you something, like they will, they are trying to, oh, how nice those dollars are sitting, those USDT are sitting on your wallet unused. Why you are not going to use them to buy this thing or that thing or that dog coin or like, uh, this or that, right? So is the way is so on a daily basis, this, you know, they are almost like luring the users into spending their USDT, and you know, they should keep the USDT as savings and then and for, for, for the families. So we realize that Tether should build the best user experience for, for these markets. We are partnering with, um, with, uh, some companies. I mean, we have an ongoing relationship with Opera, uh, with the Mini Pay, uh, but, uh, on the other side, we are looking at how, you know, Tether is building this, um, platform and open-source SDK called Wallet Development Kit, WDK, um, that aims to allow anyone to build wallets very securely, um, allows, uh, very simple, smooth user experiences where you can have a checking account for USDT and a savings account that can be Bitcoin, but also if you have some, if you move some USDT into a savings account, can do like all the magic of, uh, of moving them to, you know, a yield platform, um, decentralized yield platform, right? So checking account, savings account, couple of things very easy in the wallet, nothing too, you know, um, crazy with no tokens, no other tokens, so on, then anyone can configure to add more tokens, and, um, I mean, it's extensible, right? So, but the way we will distribute, it's very simple, very vanilla. Because, you know, I, I also trying to explain to the Bitcoiners, like, Tether does probably is the company that do most of the Bitcoin education around the world, and the problem is that we go there and we, we explain to everyone how Bitcoin works, and then they say, well, give me USD, and the reason is that they don't, they are not, not everyone is ready yet to make it that the extra step, right? So that's also what I tell to the Bitcoiners, you cannot pretend that people, all the people have in these markets have all the same amount of time that you have to, to, to go nerd and and learn about things. Um, it's very obnoxious of you to, to, to think about it. And so we have to work hard. We have to do education. You cannot be like a, an armchair Bitcoin maximalist. You have, if you want to do it, do it yourself, and you will see. So first, you have to bring them on a wallet that takes good care of them, that you know, gives them something that they're familiar with, and then you can bring them and explain, uh, to them new things, but you know, it's a, a very, very long, um, um, process, and I mean, Tether is investing a lot of money into it, and you know, it's, it's kind, kind of unique, I think.\n[Music]\nSo you're telling us about physical distribution, um, your wallet ambitions as well. I would love to hear your thoughts on the blockchains. Um, you know, I would say the vast majority of Tether activity, and you know this better than I do, has historically been on Ethereum and Tron. We've seen the rise of, uh, stablecoin specific blockchains, uh, many which are really excited to, you know, be a place for USDT, right? Um, so curious to hear your thoughts on blockchain distribution and how you see the role of Tether onchain.\nThat's a good point. I'm, um, so Tether never created its own blockchain. Um, I think that is important to, um, not cannibalize our partners. It's, uh, you know, it's, I think there should be an open market, and there should be, you know, um, fair competition across different blockchains. The problem is that there are blockchains, like I think about Ethereum, the transaction fees are very high, um, and, uh, I'd like to see more activity across chains that have, you know, better user experience, that have, uh, lower fees and all that. So I came up with this theory that I want to experiment in one of our new wallets and products is that I want to create an algorithm where periodically users can set, can have a set in the wallet where through USDT, the automatically part of the USDT will be bridged to the chain that has lower a mix between lower transaction fees and fast, uh, execution or fast confirmation. So in a way, is a way to create check and balances for chains that, you know, I don't want a chain to become very successful and then say, okay, my job is done, then I will enjoy it for the rest of my life. I think that we, you know, we want to create an ecosystem that is fair to the people and especially people that cannot afford one or $2 per transaction. So if built in in the user experience, we have a in the wallet, like at the application layer, we create a system to automatically swap and migrate funds, um, to the chains that have, uh, the lowest, lowest fees, and we do a good job in, um, in creating these QR codes that that can recognize multiple chains will keep the blockchain developers more true to the ecosystem. And so basically, your vision is that Tether itself is going to be fully agnostic to the best chain possible, right? To like that users don't even really need to know where they're sending money. It's just going to work across multiple blockchains and and therefore, you know, you're kind of picking it for them based on what you think is best for them from a transaction fee perspective. Is that right?\nYes. I think, um, I, I mean, I think that it's not even us, we are picking for them. Basically, we want a very open, transparent, public algorithm that every blockchain will see. And I, I don't have to be, I don't want to be the judge. I don't want to be accused of of being biased. I think that as long as the algorithm is public and everyone can see it, you know, everyone should be happy. We're out to the cheapest and fastest train and call today.\nThat's it. Right.\nYou raise a good point. Like, whenever I talk to people that are not really interested in crypto, generally they are interested in stablecoins, and they don't care about the underlying infrastructure ever. They only care about like what's the cheapest. And the problem is that there's so many chains that are making the claims of like what's the cheapest, and then there are also chains that take advantage of people when maybe they're cheap for some time, but then they raise fees artificially to make money. And and I think that doesn't do service to anyone because it just confuses everyone. You guys obviously have been insanely successful in terms of revenue, in terms of profits. I think last time I checked, you have a little less than 200 employees and making, you know, last year you made, uh, $13 billion, I believe, and this Q1, I think you reported another 1 billion and $6 billion in excess reserves, uh, but you guys have been investing some, a lot of those funds, you're not really letting it sit anywhere, you're making conscious investments, and a lot of the theme currently is really like decentralized infrastructure, permissionless networks, they're tokenless as well as AI and and other things. So, I would love for you to talk about kind of when you guys, you know, make so much money that you don't really even know what to do about it, right? Effectively, it's infinite amount of money. I like, I have no idea how you guys even think about investing so much of these funds. What's the thesis behind some of these investments that you're making? And can you talk about, you know, kind of what are the priorities of the people that are deciding where to put in the money?\nTether made around 20 plus billion dollars in the last two, three years. Um, so less than, I would need to check last numbers, but less than 5% has been distributed to their shareholders. So the idea is that should keep most of the money inside the investment arm of Tether. So as you said, are part of the excess reserve. So they're on top of the stablecoin so that we are a bit more over collateralized. But the rest around, let's say, 14 billion, um, or more now, are invested through different things. You know, we have a great people and great portfolio managers. So we, we have different strategies and a different allocation. So a portion of it goes to, as we discussed, having this growth in our distribution network. So from kiosks in, uh, central South America, sorry, in Africa, to pode in central South America. Actually, we have more than 50, 60 portfolio companies that are very diverse, and they are, you know, doing different things to help us to expand the installed monetary base and our reach when it comes to USDT, because I believe that if you have all these physical infrastructure, you don't sell only the dollar. I can sell, of course, Tether Gold, but I can dispute Tether Gold, but I can also distribute education, I can distribute phones, I can distribute apps, I can distribute whatever I want. That is, that is basically one of the reasons why we are doing it, because we are pro expanding very quickly across different sectors. Second is investing a portion of our assets into more digital, um, distribution networks like Rumble. Um, Rumble has 70 million users, um, in, in the western world. One interesting note is that Rumble was able, the Rumble creators were able to sell $850 million worth of gold between 20, between 2023 and 2024. So imagine what they could do with, um, a Rumble wallet with Bitcoin and maybe gold. That is, is quite, quite an opportunity in my opinion. Then we have other investments that are much more long-term, um, but very stable. We have, for example, invested in Adiagro, that is this land owner in Central South America. So it's the biggest land owner, the single land owner in South America, having land between Brazil, um, Argentina and Uruguay, but also they are producting, they have an agricultural production. So they're producing dairies, rice and, um, bioethanol and, uh, and, um, and similar. So first of all, I think that land is as scarce as as Bitcoin and, uh, and gold in a certain way. Well, Bitcoin is is very, very scarce, but, um, I think that land and gold are both very important. The issue with land is that it's not fungible, right? There are better and and worse pieces of land, but it's still a very, uh, you know, stable long-term asset, is very scarce, and humanity will always need that as humanity will always need agriculture. But on top of that, I know that and, um, Aliagro is looking at, um, USDT and stablecoins to for commodity trading. I think that just as a parenthesis, I think that commodity trading will be the biggest future lag for for growth of the market cap of USDT. So, uh, we are talking to every single commodity trader, at least the biggest ones, and they're all very interested to use USDT to trade oil or gold and and other commodities across the world.\n\n\nSo, Aduago is looking at using stablecoins for international trade because it's so much more efficient, and efficiency is very important. Efficiency of money can add an easy 5 to 10% of your revenue. So, like, if you are a commodity trader and you are trying to execute an oil deal, until the wire hits the other side, the ship cannot start loading the oil barrels. So, 1 day, 5 days, 1 week, or 10 days of delay are a huge problem for these commodity trading firms. So, that's basically what we are solving also with USDT, and I think that will just grow our market cap.\n\nSo, but Adequo is basically a very beautiful company that is, uh, that is, uh, you know, looking at these different opportunities. Then we have, um, artificial intelligence, well, we have Bitcoin mining and energy investments. I believe that, uh, you know, Tether has more than 100,000 Bitcoin in, you know, in its, um, uh, across its group, and for us, since that is a huge investment, um, we think that we need to be part of the Bitcoin mining, um, security team in a certain way, uh, in order to protect our own investment. I think that is clear that if you have $1 million and you have to decide where to put it, either in Bitcoin mining or buying Bitcoin directly, you would always make more money buying Bitcoin directly. Don't always trust the miners that say, \"Yeah, sure. Give me your million and we'll make you more money.\" But, um, in our case, I think, given the exposure that we have to Bitcoin, it is important to be part of the security of the network. Realistically, by the end of this year, Tether will become the biggest Bitcoin miner out there.\n\nUh, then on top of that, we are investing in artificial intelligence. Um, so we have the majority of this company called Northern Data. Um, that I would say is one of the top three, at least, um, if not top two independent AI infrastructure providers, having more than 24,000 GPUs. H100 is also has its own, um, AI development team. Uh, I came up with this crazy project called CUAC that is a peer-to-peer inference platform and federated learning platform and fine-tuning platform. Um, the name is derived from this short novel called, um, \"The Last Question\" from Isaac Asimov, written in 1956. Uh, \"The Last Question,\" just to spoiler it, is, well, it's 14 pages, so it's not that long. Um, \"The Last Question\" is the most complex question that humanity will ever have to solve, and you can, hence, the hardest question you can ever ask to an artificial intelligence is, \"How may entropy be reversed?\" And so I started thinking, if we want to ask that question and get an answer, even in, you know, 1 billion years, that is the time frame that the answer is being given, uh, eventually we need to have an AI that is part of the fabric of the universe itself. So, you cannot have an AI platform that is sitting in a data center somewhere belonging to open. You know, I came up with this theory, eventually, you know, people might agree or not with me, but someone asked me, \"Oh, what is, the journalist asked me, 'What to me is Tether?'\" Right? Because they said, they said to me, \"Tether, for us, is the stablecoin company,\" and I said, \"And I replied, is the stable company.\" So, is a company that aims to bring stability to communities, and stability, in my opinion, can be brought in only with three things. Stability of money, that is, you know, stablecoins for the emerging markets, you could, you could say Bitcoin for the Western world, like, because you have already more stable money. So, in order to have the best form of stability in the Western world, you would go with Bitcoin. For the emerging markets, a huge jump and leap ahead is already using stablecoins. Second is, uh, stable communication. Means, like, stable communication is harder to understand, but I see stable communication as, uh, freedom of speech, i.e., everyone should be able to be in control of their own communication, being able to talk to all their peers and families and friends, because if they get censored, then the society cannot be stable or will not be stable for long. So, if you have a control as a person, as a family, as a society, as a community, as a city, as a country, as a region of your over your communication, then it's more probable that your society will remain stable just because there is more equilibrium of power and access to information. And third, that I added recently, is actually, uh, stable intelligence.\n\nSo, if you have now with the risk of, um, of centralized AI, you know, already, uh, lack of proper lines of communications and high-quality communications and good, good money, good stable money already acted as a huge, uh, divisor between emerging markets and the Western world. But intelligence will be 1,000 times worse, right? So, it's like, if AI will start becoming aggressively more and more important and start replacing jobs and so on, that will just increase the gap between populations. You imagine, like, Italy, uh, imagine if, um, you have Italy using everyone in Italy and every single person in the public administration or private sector using artificial intelligence built from OpenAI or XAI. And then tomorrow there is, you know, the US and, um, Italy are not friends anymore. From one day to another, Italy will become dumber just because, you know, if the entire job market and entire, uh, population relies on AI not provided or not accessible, um, or not controlled by Italy.\n\nSo, in order to have a stable society and a society that grows, uh, at the same pace and is, um, where you have a proper spread, like, I think the mathematical term is equipotent, then you need, you need to have stable intelligence. Fourth would be, in a certain way, stable energy or decentralized energy. Right? So, what we are doing, trying to do in Africa, I mean, people, some people told me in Africa, \"Oh, you can just spin up a few, uh, nuclear reactors in Africa and solve their problem,\" that, you know, these people don't know, cannot point where Africa is on the map. And so, basically, what we did is creating this decentralized, uh, energy or electricity that is built through kiosks. Right? So, if you have these four things, actually, not three, you, I think you can't get to a stable society. So, that is our overall, and sorry for the long rant, but that is our overall narrative on what we are trying to build at Tether, or we are going to die trying it.\n\nUh, a lot of the things that you mentioned are kind of like almost altruistic, right? Like, it's difficult to make money from Keet. It's difficult to make money from even distribution, but, but even the AI that you mentioned, right? It's, it's almost like giving back to society. Is that part of the ethos, you know, for you and for Tether? And are shareholders just like so wealthy already that that that makes sense because, like, it's advancing society forward, or what's the thinking behind that?\n\nI'm going to say that I don't want to be mistaken for effective altruist, uh, because we all know how that went ugly before. So, but, um, look, I think that in my opinion, first of all, isn't it enough? I mean, how much we, we, we build for ourselves, right? So, there, I think that there is a limit, and also, we don't have to make money out of everything else. I mean, there are multiple ways to look at it, right? So, on one, on one side, if Keet was reaching 8 billion people in, or 8 billion users, I'm pretty sure that a way to make money out of it, we can figure it out, even without breaking its full peer-to-peer, uh, stands, staying with the peer-to-peer system. You know, we are, as I mentioned, we are building WDK, that's a Wallet Development Kit, and then WDK is open source, as our peer-to-peer AI platform. I believe that in the future, every single AI agent will have a wallet and should be a self-custodian wallet. We are going to have one trillion agents in 15 years. Those agents cannot be all connected to PayPal servers or like to JP Morgan. Like, I don't think JP Morgan will open a bank account for an AI agent. So, I think AI agents will use stablecoins and will use, uh, Bitcoin to transact.\n\nSo, if that is going to be true, if we put a self-custodian wallet in every AI agent, there is, you know, quite a likelihood that these AI agents will pick USDT as one of their currencies, if not the primary currency, because is logically, since AI should is supposed to be intelligent. So, logically, it's the most used currency, digital currency in the world in this moment, and hence, if one trillion AI agents will start using USDT, that is, you know, play nicely with our installed monetary base. Nevertheless, the system is fully peer-to-peer, people can decide to not use USDT, is fully open source, is fully programmable, so people cannot just opt out or just opt in into USDT, and this goes into my pitch. I went, I did this speech into Token 2049 this year. Uh, the, the pitch, the keynote was \"Once in a Century Company,\" that is a very bold title for a keynote. The point I was trying to make is that the reason why we're lucky at Tether is that, um, we have three things. One is the technological capabilities and the ability to create tech that is very, very cool, like Holepunch and and similar on this platform, and also we build stablecoins. Um, and so then the second one is that we have the philosophy. We come from the Bitcoin world, and so we believe that, you know, freedom is the ultimate goal. Um, I believe that I wouldn't say necessarily that I, I don't think Tether as a charity, but I think that the ultimate goal of Tether is to defend freedom, and you know, we are part of this world, and so we want to use it in the best way to obtain freedom and to ensure that everyone has freedom. I don't want to be the only person to have freedom, so I, I think that the more people have freedom, the more society will be stable, so we'll play back to our own benefit. And then third, so we have, um, tech, uh, understanding, uh, philosophy, and the third one is capital. So, no VCs will give us money to do to build stuff that will that we are not able to directly monetize. So, usually, VCs will give you money only if, uh, you, you can fully control the product. If you build peer-to-peer products, they are not necessarily like Keet and Holepunch and all this stuff are not controllable. So, I think that Tether is, for this reason, the, uh, the once-in-a-century company because we are like in a very unique position that, by the way, again, I say it again, we found ourselves in. So, we are just trying to make the best out of it and not become evil. Um, or if we become evil, just we want to make sure that the technology we create is not going, is independent from us. That is why the peer-to-peer technology.\n\nIt's fascinating. This infinite money glitch has allowed you to stay private forever. You don't ever need to raise money from VCs. You don't need to go public and have an IPO. Um, and you don't have to deal with, like, maximizing shareholder value. You can play much longer games. Um, similar to what you've kind of described. Um, a world in which you make, you know, humanity better. So, the AI agents use USDT is, uh, that's very long-term thinking.\n\nYeah, it's, it's, but it's important, right? I don't, you know, in, in our situation, the only thing we don't care about is short-term gains, right? So, we are again in a very good position. So, we can start laying, like, we invest in this company that is, uh, probably one among my preferred ones called Blackb Neoch. We are going to change the name very, very soon because it can be confused, uh, for with Blackrock Finance, and they are doing brain-computer interfaces, and I think that they are much more advanced than Neuralink in this moment. They have more than 40 patients already. The next iteration of the brain, of that brain chip, is just insane. And what I want to do to compete and in a different way than anyone else is to build a an open-source brain operating system so that I believe that in the future, in next 15 to 30 years, this will become the next smartphone. And so, maybe we are in time to build the technology that is open source so that if I have to put in myself, then, you know, I'm, I'm not going to be controlled by, you know, I'm a paranoid guy, so I just want to make sure that everyone is playing on an even playing field.\n\nThis is really insightful stuff, Paolo. Um, we're running out of time, but I have one more question. You guys have also made a couple of, like, fun investments, like, for example, the Juventus, uh, investment in the in the football club. Is that just something that the founders of Tether and executives just wanted to support because you guys are fans, or how do you think about that part of the investments that you guys are making?\n\nWell, me and Giancarlo are fans of Juventus from, you know, from forever. So, it's a fun investment, but also at the same time, there is, I think that in Italy, the football, the football ecosystem is very outdated, is almost like a political machine, and is, uh, you know, football should be for fun, but also should be football clubs, if you look at Chelsea, Real Madrid, and others, are companies and run as companies. It should not be a charity. It should be a well-run machine and company that create profits so that can improve itself and buy better players and all that and also have better communications and expand its, uh, fund base. I believe that Tether can help Juventus to expand its fund base immensely, you know, given our reach and our digital and physical distribution network. And, um, so we think that there is a lot of potential, and I think that a lot of the portfolio companies that we have in Tether can be helpful to Juventus, but, you know, we started with the heart, and then we're trying to put the brain inside.\n\nWell, um, I think, I think that's it for me, Paolo. Thank you so much for joining. Uh, like I said, this was super insightful. We've learned a lot of new things, and I, I, I really think what you guys are trying to do with the permissionless technology and freedom is something to be applauded. So, appreciate what you guys are doing for the ecosystem, and thanks so much for joining the podcast.\n\nDeeply inspiring.\n\nThank you very much, Larry.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nHave a great day.\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nThank you.\n\n[Music]\n",
