  "cleanText": "All right, ACQ2 listeners.\nWe have a very special treat with you today.\nWe have Jesse Cole, the Owner and Founder of the Savannah Bananas and the creator of Banana Ball with us here today.\nI don't think I've ever been so excited for an ACQ2 episode ever.\nThis story is the most unlikely success story and the most fun.\nIt is Baseball.\nFor anyone who hasn't paid attention, like a lot of you have probably, you're out there thinking, \"Oh, Savannah Bananas, everyone knows about that.\"\nA lot of you are also thinking, wait, how have I never heard of this if Ben and David are treating it like the whole world has heard.\nThere's these weirdly two camps.\nPeople that think everyone knows about Banana Ball and people that this is your first experience.\nIt's baseball, but there's a guy on stilts.\nThere's choreographed dances.\nIf a fan catches your foul ball, you're out.\nIf you bunt, you're ejected.\nAnd there's like 15 more rules like this.\nIt's baseball but fun.\nBut fun.\nThe craziest thing though is how much it's really caught fire.\nAnd that's I think one of the things we're going to talk about today.\nLast year they sold a million tickets.\nThis year they've sold 2 million and they have an additional 3 million person waiting list.\nIs that right, Jesse?\nSomewhere in that neighborhood.\n3.2 now.\nBut yes, but who's counting?\nThe Bananas now have over 15 million followers on social media, including more Tik Tok followers than every MLB team combined.\nTickets are $35 to gamesish.\nThere's unlimited food and drinks.\nThere's no hidden fees.\nJesse has read the quote, \"Built the Harlem Globe Trotters of baseball.\"\nAnd I think we even referred to that kind of on our IPL cricket episode, but it's not.\nAnd we're going to talk today about why it's not that.\nSo anyway, we've got the man in the yellow tuxedo.\nJesse, thank you so much for joining us.\nTruly fired up to be with you guys.\nAs I shared in our first call, big fan, been a listener of the podcast, learned so much and shared your podcast with many people on our team.\nSo excited to be with you.\nTurn it around a little bit today.\nWell, we hope we can atone for calling you the Harlem Global Chatters of of baseball.\nA lot of people call us that.\nIt's the easiest comparison.\nSo, I get it.\nOkay.\nYou're like a student of business history.\nWe have so many interesting business angles to analyze the Bananas from, but I want this in narrative form.\nSo, take me back.\nHow did Banana Ball start?\nOh geez.\nWell, well, let's start as a 23-year-old general manager of a team in Gastonia, North Carolina that had 200 fans coming to their games and $268 in the bank account and was losing $150,000 a year.\nThat was my first job.\nAnd this wasn't even the minor leagues.\nThis was like a a college summer league, right?\nYeah.\nThere's like major league AAA, double A, high A, regular A, rookie ball, independent ball, and then there's like college summer baseball way down there.\nSo, we were one of the lowest levels of baseball and the team was there and failing.\nThe only way you get a job as a general manager at 23.\nIt has to be one of the worst teams in the country.\nAnd that's how I got the gig.\nWe had to turn it around and I started meeting with everyone.\nI got hung up on numerous phone calls.\nPeople weren't interested in working with us.\nAnd I realized that we couldn't be a baseball team.\nWe had to make it more about entertainment because we were never going to have the best baseball players.\nSo that's when I just started reading every book about PT Barnum, Walt Disney, Circus LA, SNL, WWE, and I just said, \"Let's get crazy.\"\nAnd yeah, we started doing Grandma Beauty pageantss, flatulence fun nights, salute to underwear nights, a dig to China night where we actually buried a certificate to China in the infield dirt.\nAnd after the game, we had everyone dig to China, like an actual trip to China.\nYeah.\nBut it was just a one-way flight to China.\nNo flight back and no accommodations.\nSo Oh my god.\nWe fired our mascot for uh bear growth hormone BGH when that was remember HGH was really big.\nSo we did that.\nWe offered George Bush after his term was over an internship with us.\nWe're going to give a host family a stipen.\nSo we just started doing everything to create attention.\nIn this era you were doing like crazier but typical minor league baseball stuff, right?\nLike you were still just playing baseball but doing stunts, right?\nIt was traditional baseball which had to get people excited about it.\nAnd so it was really what people don't realize it was 10 years there of experimenting, you know, with the pregnant nights and you name it.\nI mean, we did everything.\nAnd that's when people started to say, \"I'm coming to the show.\nI'm coming to have fun.\"\nAnd that was the first time we had players dance.\nI actually had players learn how to dance during the game.\nSo, we started really experimenting for 10 years there with very little notice.\nNow, we climbed up to be fourth in the country in attendance.\nWe started selling out games, but it was in a little tiny suburb of Charlotte.\nAnd I think we had one media story in my 10 years.\nLike that was it.\nBut the team was profitable.\nIt was successful.\nIt was doing very well.\nAnd what was the team called?\nThe Gastonia Grizzlies.\nNow they no longer exist.\nSo I guess they didn't do as well as I hoped.\nBut we did a good job with them.\nAnd then they ended up getting sold and now they got a professional team in Gastonia.\nSo it actually helped steer the way to building a whole brand new stadium in professional baseball.\nBut the actual college summer team no longer exists.\nAnd you had a background as a player, right?\nYou were a pitcher.\nYeah.\nSo, I played and I played division one college ball.\nUh I was getting seen by professional scouts.\nI thought that was my dream and that's where I was going to go.\nBefore I went to Gastonia, I went into coaching and you know, you don't play, you go coach.\nBut I realized there I was coaching in the Cape Cod League, which you guys may know is probably one of the best.\nThat's kind of the premier college summer league, right?\nCorrect.\nAnd I was sitting there literally next to the best players in the world in the dugout with the best seat in the house and I was bored out of my mind.\nThere's a difference when you're playing the game versus when you're watching the game.\nAnd I was like, \"All right, I know we're going to hit and run here.\nAll right, this hitter's coming up.\nWe're going to bring in this guy.\"\nAnd I'm like still bored.\nAnd I'm like, I can't imagine the fans that don't love baseball how they're feeling.\nAnd that was kind of the little start to all of that.\nAnd I studied Walt Disney probably more than anyone.\nAnd he said when he was at Griffith Park watching his two daughters, Saturday was Daddy Day with Walt.\nand he went to the carousel at Griffith Park and he said, \"Man, I wish there was a place adults and kids could have fun together.\"\nAnd that was where the idea of Disneyland started.\nAnd I remember vividly being in that dugout and just saying, \"I wish the game was fun for everyone and not just people who were playing the game.\"\nAnd that's kind of where it started.\nAnd Gastonia was 10 years of experimenting before the colossal failure of the beginning of the Savannah Bananas.\nHave you always had this personality type?\nMost people would observe, you know, this isn't that fun, but hey, this is the industry I'm in.\nThis is the game I'm in.\nThis is the sport.\nMost people would never plant a ticket in the infield and say, you know, let's do a dig to China.\nI wanted to be successful.\nI wanted to figure out how to make it work.\nI wanted to put my name on something and create something special.\nBut I started in 2007208.\nThat was the peak of Major League Baseball.\n80 million fans were going to baseball, like Major League Baseball games, you know, now it's around 70 million, I think.\nBut it was dominating.\nI still saw something because I played the game and I was watching and it was just it wasn't that exciting.\nThe game's got to be over three hours long.\nI mean, that's a long game.\nAnd I was sitting there, I was like, \"God, I can't wait till this game's over.\"\nAnd I'm coaching the team.\nIf you're coaching the team and on the dugout and you can't wait till the game's over, there's got to be a fundamental problem.\nAnd that was kind of the start of let's make something fun.\nLet's try something.\nLet's experiment.\nAnd Gastonia, you're employed.\nI didn't get paid the first few months.\nYes.\nBut I eventually got paid.\nYes.\nSomebody else owned the team and they employed you as the GM.\nI was employed as the GM.\nI became the managing partner and got a piece of ownership and then ended up buying that team.\nSo after 10 years, but yes, it was 10 years of a slow build from losing hundreds of thousands of dollars to making a little bit of money.\nHow does it work to buy that team?\nWas that a risk for you financially?\nYou know what's so funny?\nThe team was worth probably nothing when I started, which was crazy.\nThe owner, who I'm so close with, and he actually ended up marrying my wife and I at our field in Gastonia.\nSo, like that's how full circle it is.\nBut I joke because I had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for this team that was worth nothing when we started, but because we made it to one of the high I was like I hurt myself colossally there.\nBut no, we made a good deal owner financing.\nHe helped me get started and and I took it over in uh I think 2014 is when I bought that.\nOkay.\nSo, how does that lead to the Savannah Bananas?\nSo, long story short, the last game of 2014, August 4th, 2014, I had met my well, she was my girlfriend at the time, our director of fun, Emily McDonald.\nNow, how did I meet her?\nI was hosting a seminar our first year and she was working for Cal Ripken and Ripken Baseball, working for the Augusta Green Jackets.\nAnd so, she was in minor league baseball.\nAnd I hosted a seminar.\nThis is how crazy I'm 24 years old.\nAnd I'm like, I'm going to host a seminar.\nI only hosted it because I wanted to learn.\nSo, I was like, \"Can I get everyone here from minor league baseball?\nLike, pay nothing.\nJust come.\nWe'll do a seminar.\"\nAnd luckily, I got some people to come.\nAnd I'm talking about our grandma beauty pageantss.\nAnd her boss left the conference and called her and said, \"I just met the guy you're going to marry.\"\nAnd Emily's like, \"What are you talking about, Amy?\"\nLike, and she's like, \"No, he's got the energy, the enthusiasm, the passion.\nHe's all in it like you are.\nJust reach out to him.\nAsk some business questions and maybe you guys can connect.\"\nSo, she reached out.\nI I told her about our grandma beauty pageantss and our craziness, and we just stayed in touch.\nThen we met again at a minor league promo seminar.\nHit it off.\nShe came to work for us.\nWe didn't tell anybody.\nLike literally was like she wanted to build herself in the industry.\nSo she was like we had to keep it secret.\nSo for a whole year she's literally our director of fund.\nWe are the most professional relationship like no anything.\nAnd she's working.\nShe's joins every board like the YMCA, the United Way.\nShe's a part of everything in the community.\nBuilds herself up.\nAnd then after a year, we tell people I think a year later on the last game of the year because I met her at our stadium in Gastonia, the first time I met her in person in front of a soldout crowd.\nI uh stopped the game in the middle of the sixth inning.\nAnd I'm thanking all of our players, all of our cast, all of our staff.\nAnd I say, \"Last but not least,\" and I went into her and I told, \"We met here at this field.\nThis is the first time in front of my family, your family, and our entire baseball family.\nWill you make me the luckiest guy in the world?\"\nDropped down to a knee, had the ring inside a baseball, had fireworks go off in the middle of the game.\nSo, like just delayed the game completely.\nLike 20 minutes.\nI'm like, \"This is our moment.\"\nAnd the umpires are like, \"Are we going to play soon?\"\nI'm like, \"Just let us own this moment.\"\nThank goodness.\nShe said yes.\nSo then that night she was just so excited.\nI went to sleep after the game.\nShe planned a trip to Savannah.\nShe's like, \"You did this epic proposal.\nI want to plan a weekend for us to have fun.\"\nAnd so we went down to Savannah.\nI was like, \"M, we got to check out the minor league stadium.\"\nI mean, we never been there.\nShe's like, \"Yeah.\"\nJust like, \"Oh, like it's a beautiful place.\nBeautiful place to go.\"\nLike a weekend together.\nLike that was it.\nNothing.\nBut I was like, \"M, we got to check out this stadium.\"\nShe's like, \"All right.\"\nSo, we went to the minor league stadium and I'll never forget.\nWe walk in, you could feel the history.\nIt was like 1926 ballpark.\nBabe Ruth played there.\nHank Aaron played there.\nJackie Robinson played there.\nIt was amazing.\nAnd then we walk in, it's a beautiful night, 80°, and there's nobody there.\nI mean, like 200 people max.\nYou can almost picture a tumble weed just going through the grand stand.\nLike, what is going on?\nAnd so I immediately called the commissioner of our league and I said, 'If this team, this minor league team, New York Mets affiliate, ever leaves, we're calling this market.\nAnd he's like, \"Sure, Jesse.\n\n\n\"Whatever you say. It's a minor league market.\" A month later, they say, \"We want a brand new stadium, $38 million, or we're leaving.\" The city's like, \"We're not building you a $38 million stadium.\" And they're like, \"Peace out. We're gone.\"\n\nAnd I'm like, where did they go to? Columbia, South Carolina. Huh. And so they left. And we then convinced the city of Savannah to give a lease to us to start a college summer team. They had minor league baseball for 90 years, and we convinced them to let us have a college summer team at this old majestic stadium. And that's when it got really, really hard. But that's how it started.\n\nAnd I was reading, \"That's a $20,000 per year lease that you signed. Is that right?\"\n\nYes. And that was just what we had in Gastonia. So again, I've learned if you have a good precedent, share it. Like if you have a very good precedent, share it. And I was like, \"$20,000 a year. I was like, 'This is what we pay. You know, we're just a small little college summer team. Please help us.'\" And they worked with us and shared it. And so they said yes, and we convinced them. But that's when it got really hard.\n\nEmily said yes. They said yes. Everybody's saying yes at this point except for the fans. The fans all said no immediately.\n\nI got to stop you for one minute. Actually, I can't remember we talked about this before. You're just bringing back like so many memories of my childhood. My family's in the Baseball business. My dad was one of the founders of the Atlantic League, which is one of the big independent minor leagues. And so, yeah, my whole childhood was going around with my dad to these cities that either had minor league baseball teams in the past, the team had left, or great cities where they were in the territory of a major league team and so couldn't have a minor league team, and we would go pitch these municipalities exactly like you were doing.\n\nYeah. So, we pitched them, they said yes, and then we showed up and the former team cut the phone lines, they cut the internet lines, they took everything out of the ballpark. There was nothing left. And so we walk in, it's myself, my wife. I'm 31 at the time. Emily's 28. Our team president is 24 years old, and we have three 22-year-olds straight out of college who were interns. So this is our crew, and we're like, we're going to take this on. We had this big vision. I was like, if we could start from scratch, if we could make the team any way we want to and like all-inclusive tickets, non-stop entertainment, I like we were ready. And then we proceeded to sell two tickets in the first three months.\n\nA guy gave us a donation. It was like, \"Here you go.\" We had a launch event where we gave out like free food, free alcohol. We were going onto doors and knocking, like literally knocking at restaurants, knocking at shops. They were like, \"We're not interested.\" About a hundred people showed up for a free event. And the conference center felt so bad they didn't even charge us for all the food and all the alcohol. It was so bad, guys, on how we started. And the fans were pissed that they'd lost their official minor league team.\n\nYeah. And so they're like, \"Oh, this is some college thing coming in.\" We got college summer baseball. We had professional baseball. This is the lowest of low. Why would we support this? We're not interested. And we heard it everywhere.\n\nHelp me understand. Did you still own the Grizzlies at this point?\n\nYes. So, I had both teams. So, at that point, you know, I was living in Gastonia and just coming back and forth to Savannah, but we were failing so bad that on January 15th, 2016, we got the phone call that we'd overdrafted our account and we were completely out of money for the Bananas. We launched on October 4th, October 5th, 2015. Within three months, we sold a handful of tickets. By January, we were completely out of money. And so Emily turned to me and said, \"Jesse, we have to sell our house. We have no other options.\" So, we sold our house up in Gastonia. We emptied out our savings account. We found a dump down in Savannah. It was an old garage, guys. It was a garage turned into a studio.\n\nAnd so, wait, you could have just said, \"Hey, the Savannah team's not working out. I own and have a like reasonably decent team over with the Grizzlies. Let's just cut our losses.\" but instead you sell your house. The Gastonia team was kind of successful. Now it wasn't like there wasn't cash flow like crazy, and it's a college summer team. You play 30 games, the money comes in during the summer. So that time there's no money anywhere. Like we're just like we don't have money at all. And we got all these people were responsible for the six people in Savannah, and then we have our people in Gastonia. Our option was sell our house. So we sold our house, emptied our savings account, found a dump. Emily went and got a twin air bed. Not even like a queen or a king air bed. She got a twin air bed. And this is how gross this place is, guys. Like we had to sleep in our socks. Like you never sleep in your socks. Like that is crazy talk. It was disgusting. There were cockroaches. It was gross.\n\nWe were reading at the time a book by Mike Macauitz, *Profit First*. And that there was a chapter in there about saving. You need to enjoy saving more than spending. And it's just one more day, one more day. And so we had phone chargers that were like falling apart. And we just kept saying one more day, one more day. And we'd grocery shop with just $30 for a whole week. We'd go into Walmart with a $20 bill and a $10 bill. And so we have 42 meals for a week, and that's what we were doing for months because we couldn't sell anything. People hadn't experienced us. We were just a college summer team.\n\nWow. Okay. So the state of play 2016. Were you already studying P.T. Barnum and Walt Disney at this point in time? Like did you have the vision?\n\nYes. Oh, I was reading everything on them. I just knew we we had to get fans to experience it. Walt had his I mean literally he went bankrupt with laughs. He had his struggles. P.T. Barnum. Everyone had their struggles. It was just no one had experienced our product in Savannah. And so we were just this, and marketing is not what you say. Marketing is what you do. You have to create an experience that is remarkable. And so we hadn't done that. That's where we had to take a page out of P.T. Barnum's book and said, \"How are we going to create attention? We need to name the team something completely different and wild to get attention because right now nothing's working. I can tell them about what we're doing, but no one cares.\"\n\nWhat was the like temporary name that you were using when you were marketing to the community?\n\nSavannah Baseball 2016. I mean there there was no name like the Washington Football Club, right? Real ring to it. The year before when I started like our company, it was like Team Cole and Associates, like a terrible law firm, our accounting office. Eventually when we came to Savannah, we changed it to Fans First Entertainment because that's our mission. Fans first. Everything we do is fans first. So Fans First became our guiding light, our northstar, but fans hadn't experienced what we've done. So we were like, okay, we got to name the team. We do a name the team contest. We got a thousand generic suggestions. Spirits, ports, anchors. Everyone's like, \"You got to be the Braves.\" I'm like, \"There's a Braves team in Georgia. We're not going to be the Braves.\" All right. It's not going to happen, guys. And then one suggestion, a 62-year-old nurse, Lynn Moses, suggested bananas.\n\nHad you already been thinking bananas? Had it crossed your mind or\n\nIt had been thrown around, and we thought about it, but we're like, \"Well, anybody suggest it, you know?\" And then she suggested it and we looked. We had Yes. Yes. A senior citizen dance team. The Banana Nanas, a male cheerleading team, the Mananas, a mascot named Split. Go Bananas. Bananas in the pants that people catch it during promotions. Can't stop the peeling. We started thinking of everything. And I was like, \"This is crazy enough. It could work.\"\n\nThis was actually interesting. I haven't told many people about this. So, we had to get a logo designed, right? And we had no money. And so, everybody said, \"Just work with someone local and do the logo.\" Anyone on our team, my wife, our president, everyone was like, \"Jesse, we don't have the money.\" And I'm like, \"Guys, we have to get the logo right. Like, this is important or it's not going to work.\" And they're like, \"We don't have money.\" There was one group, Studio Simon, that does like really good food animated logos. And I went to him, and he was like, \"It's $12,000.\" I'm like, \"We don't have that anywhere. We don't have $1,000. I have $30 to grocery shop, guys. We won't eat this week. We'll figure it out.\" I told him the vision, and I negotiated him down. It was still high figure. And our team was like, \"Jess, we can't.\" I'm like, \"Guys, we have to. This is it. We just have to. So, we put everything into this logo that we had. And the first time he showed it to me, I was like, 'Yes.' Like, 'This is it, guys.'\" Excuse my language, but I said, \"I want a badass banana. This can't be a soft banana. I need a badass banana. Tropical fun colors. It needs to work.\" And he delivered. I knew when we had that, I was like, \"All right, people are going to criticize us like crazy for the name. You can't criticize this logo. This logo is good.\" And I was like, \"You can't criticize it.\" I was right. We named the team. We had a big event February 25th, 2016.\n\nI just have to stop listeners to have Jesse say, \"I haven't told this story before or I haven't told the story to many people.\" There's an ESPN show about the Bananas. They were just on 60 Minutes. You're on Disney Plus. Like, yeah, you have told the story that this is a rare privilege for us to get to talk to you in a format like this.\n\nJesse, I have to tell you, this morning I I went to my local Starbucks and as I am ducking out, I see someone wearing a Banana's hat and I was just like, \"This is too perfect.\" I love it. I love it.\n\nIt's the power of the banana, man. Walt Disney said, \"It all started with a mouse. It all started because of a mouse.\" And it's crazy. We were on an airbed grocery shopping with $30. But when we named the team Bananas on February 25th, 2016, everything started to change. Now, at first, terribly, the criticism we received for naming the team Bananas. To give you an example, that night, the owner should be thrown out of town. Whoever came by the name should be fired. You're an embarrassment to the city. You'll never sell a ticket. They had the big St. Patrick's Day parade in Savannah. Now, this is like hundreds of thousands of people come. It's like one of the biggest in the country. So, we proudly, myself and our staff. That was it. We wore our t-shirts down to the parade. We were getting booed everywhere we walked. Imagine walking down the street. All right. You I'm 31. My wife's 28. We got 22-year-olds. We were just getting booed for what we're wearing. I was like, \"This is brutal.\" My mental image of Savannah is this like beautiful old school southern very tradition steeped community, and here you are you took their beloved baseball team where like Babe Ruth played there and Hank Aaron played there and like we're making this the Bananas. We made it a joke. It was like this has to be a joke. We made it a joke, and you know everyone's like it doesn't even make sense, Bananas. And some people said no, we're one of the biggest ports of bananas. I'm like yep 100%. Like not at all. Like that is not true. Like it sounded awesome, and we had an amazing idea to build this into a fun brand with all the different things. The banana baby that we lift up before the game with a baby in a banana costume and sing nah Sylvania, like all these ideas that we wanted to put into our show. But they they had a reason. They had a reason to criticize. We hadn't earned anything. We hadn't done anything. You know, we were just talk, and we had a big vision and to make it fun, but they had to experience it. We were criticized. We were ripped apart. Now people started to like maybe I should buy tickets. Maybe I should see what they're all about. Maybe I should listen. We created a sellout mentality.\n\nSo people don't know this either. Yeah. Gez, I'd share this internal. Sorry guys, I'm getting into it a little bit. So we had 28 games on the schedule. We condensed it to 22 and made double headers so we could create some more demand and excitement because no one wants to come to a Monday or Wednesday game. So we said, let's create double headers on Wednesday so we have six less games and a bigger chance of selling out more games. So that was the first thing we did. And then we said,\n\n\n\"Okay, what if we build five game plans, but we only sell 250?\" And then we announced those are sold out. But you don't control the league. You're working with the league to do some wonky scheduling and have them just roll with your ideas. Luckily, with 10 years in Gastonia, we've built some success. They started to give me a little bit more opportunity. I said, \"Hey, we need this to work, guys. This is a big win.\" And I actually bought the team from the league. So, I owed them money every single year, hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, they needed this to win. And so like that's some of the inside game as well. They were like we'll work with you and we know there's creating some excitement and energy. So when we announced the team, ESPN Sports Center put on it, said logo of the year question mark with the Bananas. So we were on Sports Center for like 15 minutes, which is like for us a college summer team. That's as big as it gets. Like we were like game over, guys. We did it. We did it. Haven't played a game yet, but it's over. We and we walked around town and got booed. So it was like really up and down between how we were feeling in the first weeks. But we convinced enough people to come out. We pushed all the tickets to opening night. We're like, we're going to get everybody to come to opening night, create this unbelievable thing, and like go all in. So, you knew you needed a great show opening night. 100%. And so, that's why we had our banana nanas, so we had them ready to go. We had the banana baby. We had a break dancing coach. We went all in. We had the first banana instead of the first pitch. So, you throw a banana. I mean, we were thinking about it. And then the team was wearing green uniforms because we weren't quite ripe. So, like, we literally went we went all out. This is a new team. This is all college players. Anybody who watches the Bananas now, like these are incredible entertainers. I assume you didn't have any of that. Like these guys didn't know how to dance. They were just like college summer baseball players. But they're good baseball players. Yes. But we had to convince them to play for a team called the Bananas. So like the recruiting was harder than it ever was. And literally when they showed up, we spent a day and a half teaching them and coaching them when they get criticism. How does it feel playing for a team named after a fruit? We had to coach them media training and say like, \"Hey, do you hate the name, too?\" And it's like, \"Guys, no, we don't say we hate the name. We're excited to have fun. Like we try to teach them to embrace it. Our first practice we filmed, they did it with just bananas. So we did batting practice with bananas. We did throwing with bananas. We did catching with bananas. We fully embraced it and just made it fun. And are they worried about destroying their reputation? Like they're trying to get recruited by major league teams and are they worried about the perception of being part of a joke? Maybe, but it's college summer ball. Anything kind of goes in the college summer ball. Yeah. They're all playing at these top level colleges and somehow we actually got good players. But that first night, we made six errors. So, we're playing in green uniforms cuz we're not quite ripe and we made six errors, but a few crazy things happened. So, we had a rain delay. The first thing I said is it's a graining and everyone's there just getting poured on. And I said, \"Nanas, just go out and dance.\" And they went out in the field and dance. And they were wearing white jerseys and it's pouring rain and it's banana nanas. So, talk about another viral moment that was unintentional. Okay. The nanas being the grandma dance team. The banana nanas. Our senior citizen dance team is dancing in white jerseys as it's raining on them during the rain delay. All right. Ridiculous. So, we had the first night all you can eat. And again, that was part of our fans first model that you briefly mentioned before. We made every single ticket all- inclusive. So, all your burgers, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches, soda, water, popcorn, dessert, everything inclusive. It was $15 when we started, but we had no idea what we were doing. So, we went through 10,000 pieces of meat in the first hour. I mean, it was a disaster. People were waiting like 2 to 3 hours. We end up going through with like every other type of food we had because people couldn't get it. So I assume you lost money because people did all they can eat more than Yes and no. People don't realize you can't eat that many burgers and hot dogs and even if a burger a really high quality burger is one or $2 and sodas are 2030 cents. A good hot dog's 80 cents. We'd always act like yeah we're losing our shirt on this. Theoretically you're not really. But you want to make a product that people feel like they can take advantage of you. I love the idea of making a product that people get so excited. They're like I'm going to take advantage of them. I'm going to get it. I'm like, \"Yes, you go get it, man. You go get it.\" It's just that mindset. But they watched, you know, the players go into the crowd and deliver roses to little girls. They watched the dancing. They watched the entertainment. And after that night, they started telling people like, \"We've never seen anything like this.\" And that changed everything. They had to experience it first. And that was kind of the start of playing traditional baseball at that point. But fans were coming in now and we were starting to sell out game after game after game. So, it sort of worked out of the gate. Well, it didn't work until the first gate and then the first gate it worked at. Is it right to say you kind of had product market fit with fans from your first game on? Yes. As soon as they experienced it. Yes. I would say right out of the gate the airbed and the grocery shop. Yes. There was not. But it after six nine months once they started seeing it they're like this is something different. This is good for Savannah. Savannah's a fun city. People want to have fun. It worked out. So what's your debt load personally look like at this snapshot in history? Oh jeez. I'm I'm over seven figures in debt. It was tough cuz you owed money to the league. Ow money to the league. Owed money to start up. We had to get a place to live. I mean, it was it was a lot of things. Money to put in, money to start, owing money for the league. Then I actually still owed Ken Silver, the Owner of Gastonia. So, I still had that team. I mean, it was it was a piles of piles of debt. So, this must be a pretty wild thing that you're sitting on owing all these payments to all these different parties and you have a thing that's really working, but it's not like super cash generative even though it has great product market fit. what was happening. Merchandise was bigger than we ever imagined. So like even when we were first launched on February 25th, we did merchandise from all 50 states and different countries immediately. Now Sports Center, we were national. I mean it was Yahoo's front page, which Yahoo was a big thing, you know, back then. We were everywhere. And so merchandise was selling. And it was crazy. Nationally, the brand was loved. Locally it was not loved, which to be honest is still kind of a thing like national, local. There's there's all these different mindsets of us as we've grown and as we've developed into what we are. But yeah, merchandise was bigger than we ever imagined. Like our biggest day in Gastonia ever, we were doing that in hours. It was just it was it wasn't even a comparison what the Savannah Bananas were doing in merchandise.\nYou've created almost a lifestyle brand. If I wear the Savannah Bananas logo, it says more about me than it does about me liking baseball. That's a good point. We have people come up to us every day and they say whenever they want to feel good about themselves, they wear our shirt cuz people will come up to them and say, \"I love your shirt. Go bananas. Have you seen them?\" It creates conversation. Even today every time people wear the shirts are now the party animals and our other brands are happening that so yeah I think lifestyle brand was an accidental thing that happened. I want to spend one more minute on business model here. I mean I remember from my youth and my family there's four main revenue lines for minor league baseball. There's tickets, there's merchandise and then there's food and bev and advertising. Even in those early days and I think certainly now you basically cut off the last two. No advertising, no sponsorship and food and bev is included. Yeah. Tickets and food and bev came together. Now again, there was auxiliary, you know, there was alcohol and some specialty items, ice cream and other all the ballpark basics were included. So there was a little bit of food and be but basically that covered your cost and then sponsorship we had in the first few years but it wasn't much. Our first few years it was probably 15 20% of our our total business. And then you ultimately cut it all off, right? Yeah. We thought two weeks before a global pandemic might as well eliminate another big source of revenue for the team. Yes. It was February 25th, 2020 that we made an announcement that we don't believe anybody comes to a ballpark to be sold to, marketed to, or advertised to. And we want to give this historic ballpark back to the fans. We're creating an ad-ree stadium here in Savannah. And we eliminate all the ads. And right there, hundreds of thousands of dollars we just threw away. We actually created a fan wall. So instead of ads, fans get to sign the wall and put their name on the wall. So where there's zero revenue, but what we wanted to do was that we work for one person and it's the fan. Like that's who we work for. And a lot of times when you have sponsors and advertisers, they try to extract value from fans. We want to give value to fans with everything we do. And what do we believe we can be the best in the world at? It's putting on the greatest show in sports. It's not selling ads. Three, four, five years ago, everyone started going to digital. If you're an advertiser, do you want to put an ad at a stadium? Is that the best use of your 10, 2020$20,000 or whatever? And so we just started to put ourselves in our fans shoes in every way and we just said no, we're going to lean in all in on that. So yes, tickets and merchandise that is 95% of our entire business model. I'm going to foreshadow something we'll get to later in the episode around ticketing, but when we were chatting before this, you sort of have this principle that shows up in a lot of different mechanics in your business, which is no one is allowed to sit in between us and our fans and no one is allowed to extract value out of that relationship. It is a pure product that we make for them that they pay for. You're more obsessed with that than any entrepreneur I've ever met. Well, go back to Walt Disney. control the endto-end experience. And he learned that with his final masterpiece, you know, Magic Kingdom. I mean, he even built his own government inside the Rudy Creek district inside Disney World so he could control getting permits, putting out fireworks, doing all the voting. Like, that's what he learned when he built Disneyland. It was only 190 acres or so. And literally became, he called it the neon jungle. Everyone just moved around, all these hotels, and he had to build a wall to keep it out so he could control the experience. And so, he learned that every step of the way. And I was like, well, how do we do that? If you want to create a truly great experience, you have to do it end to end. And we're still struggling with that when we go to other stadiums. That's why eventually when we build a potential banana land, you know, we would control every end to end experience. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Keep thinking about how this business model is going to apply to other stadiums. Pivotal moment that we haven't talked about yet. At some point, you stopped playing college summer league baseball and started playing Banana Ball. Yeah. When was that? How did that happen? What did it look like mechanically? So we literally put ourselves in our fans shoes. So people don't realize we go undercover. So we walk up with the fans, we drive park with the fans, we sit with the fans, we eat with the fans, and after every game we talk about what are the friction points of the experience. We believe that's a starting point of all innovation to create a fan for life is to eliminate all the friction. So we were doing this and you know I have videos of myself coming in hat classes and walking in and experiencing it. And what I realized was people started to get my voice. So I had to be I had to be strategic on when I talked and when I didn't talk. But we noticed that I started watching and fans even with all the entertainment and I guys I mean we have a promotion every half inning and promotion I mean like a crazy skit. You name it. It's wild. And people were still leaving games early. And so what I started to realize that it's a fundamental problem with the game. You know I think about like New York City hot dog stand, right? You got the great condiments, you got the sauerkraut, you got the mustard, you got the ketchup, you got all the good stuff, right? That's all our entertainment. But the hot dog still needs work and that's baseball. And so when I started watching this, I was like, \"All right, there's a challenge here.\" So around nine o'clock fans would start leaving games. 9:15 more. You were like monitoring security camera footage to try to figure out when do people start leaving. We had people on our team every 30 minutes, they would take a picture and a video of the corner of the grandstands. Every 30 minutes. This was a whole year of doing this. That night he would send me the visuals and the pictures and we have that and we started tracking on when they're leaving. But you could see literally at 9\n\n\n:00 You would watch just a rush of people get up.\nIt was like they just knew, \"9:00, we're good.\"\nAnd so I'm watching this over and over again, and I'm like, \"All right, we're putting every form of entertainment possible. We're winning championships too. Like, we're winning games.\"\nEntertainment, there is a problem.\nSo then I just went to the, you know, the mindset, we look at everything.\nWhatever is normal, do the exact opposite.\nAnd if we were to put ourselves in our fans' shoes, what are all the boring parts of a baseball game?\nWhat are all the things that we could change to make it so exciting, so fun that every night, regardless of the entertainment, people want to watch the game?\nSo, I started an idea book in 2016, 2017.\nSo, write down 10 ideas every day.\nAnd guys, that's a lot of bad ideas.\nI mean, I'm talking about 70, 80% bad ideas.\nYou were writing down 10 ideas every day starting in 2016.\nYeah, I believe you got to work your idea muscle.\nIf you want to have great ideas, you got to work your idea muscle.\nAnd so what I realized is people that work out, they work out every day and they get their reps in, and it gets really hard at six, seven, eight, nine, but that's how they push through.\nThat's how they grow.\nThat's how they develop.\nSo the same thing with ideas.\nSo I just said, \"We got to start writing down ideas.\"\nAnd I still do it to this day.\nBut what I realized is from the idea book, I was like, \"All right, let's think about baseball. What are the boring rules of baseball? What are the boring parts of baseball?\"\nSo start writing down mound visits.\nNot one fan gets excited about a mound visit.\nThere's not one fan's like, \"Ah, I can't wait. I need more mound visits. Let's get some money. I wonder what they're talking about out there. Oh, yeah. I can't wait. Oh, seventh inning. We're gonna get some more mound visits now. It's that time.\"\nIt just doesn't happen.\nI watched the game.\nI'll never forget.\nIt was the Dodgers playing.\nYasil Pig, you know, remember he was like a superstar for like a flash in the pan.\nAnd I watched he'd get in the box and then he'd step out, and I was like, \"Whoa, that was a lot of time.\"\nSo then I grabbed my phone.\nI started timing it, and it was 25 to 35 seconds every time he stepped out.\nAnd he had a six-pitch at bat.\nSo 3 minutes of the bat, he wasn't even in the batter's box.\nI go, \"There's not one fan in the world that likes watching guys step out of the box. Eliminate that.\"\nAnd so I just kept looking.\nI said, \"Walks. You're out if you step out, right?\"\nThat's the Banana Ball rule.\nIt's a strike.\nIt's a strike.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nIf you step out, it's a strike.\nAnd then I started keep thinking.\nI was like, \"Walks.\"\nI go, \"There's a rule or a play in sports. It's actually called a walk, which is so unathletic. It's called the walk. Like, what is wrong with us?\"\nAnd so I was like, \"Well, what's the opposite of a walk?\nA sprint.\"\nAnd I started thinking, \"All right, how can we create a sprint action?\nWhat can we do?\nYou punish the pitcher.\nYou create this.\"\nAnd so that's where we developed the ball four sprint.\nSo on the ball four, literally the catcher has to throw the ball to every person in the field before it's live, and the hitter can get as many bases as he wants.\nYou know, that was turning into a double, a triple.\nNow the defense is ridiculous.\nSo it's it's hard now, but you'll see it once a game.\nUsually someone get a double out of him.\nSo that's where it started.\nAnd then fans first are guiding light on everything.\nNo ticket fees, no convenient fees, no service fees, no sponsorship.\nAnd then we just kept thinking it's like, well, what's a fans first rule?\nWell, let's fans play the game.\nLet's have them be a part of the game.\nSo if a fan catches a foul ball, it's an out.\nThe way I learned to do this is always picture what the perfect scenario is.\nSo what would be like the perfect scenario is a fan catch a foul ball to win the game and then he's rushed on the field.\nHe or she is doing the media interviews.\nThat's what I pictured.\nAnd so he said, \"If that were to happen, would it be amazing?\"\nAnd we said, \"Yeah.\"\nAnd so lo and behold, two years ago, a 15-year-old kid caught a line drive in front of his sister's head, caught it.\nWe rushed him on the field.\nHe's running up and down.\nis on the front page of the paper the next day.\nI was like, \"It happened.\nWe did it.\"\nIt's so those little things, but then also the time, the two-hour time limit.\nEveryone was telling me, Jesse, you got to do two and a half.\nYou know, the games were 3 hours and 12 minutes in Major League Baseball.\nGo to two and a half and I'll make it.\nI go, no, two.\nYou want people to want more.\nYou don't go to a movie in the middle of the movie and say, \"That was a great movie.\nI left in the middle.\"\nAlso, I mean, like, this is a family thing, right?\nPeople are bringing their kids.\nYou don't want your kids up till 10:00.\nLike, that's miserable.\nLike, you got to get them home.\nYou got to get them to bed.\nLike 100%.\nI want people to want more and not a great comedian or anything.\nYou're not going to like, oh, it was awesome.\nI just want to get out early, though.\nLike, you don't do that.\nBut baseball games, it happens all the time.\nAnd then the last thing I said, well, what's really bad on a game that people don't want to come to?\nIt's a blowout.\nYou know, if team's up by eight runs, 10 runs, they're not going to play.\nSo, I said, well, how do you change the scoring?\nAnd this is where my dad came into play.\nMe and my dad were as close as it could be.\nWe talk all the time.\nI said, \"Dad, what could we do with scoring?\"\nAnd he started, he's a big golfer.\nHe's like, \"Well, what about match play or something?\nWhat if we did something?\"\nAnd we started talking.\nWe what about every inning?\nWhat if every inning counts for a point?\nAnd so even if a team scores seven runs, they can only get one point and it'll never ever be a blowout because you can only get one point an inning.\nIt keeps the game more competitive.\n100%.\nAnd so but the challenge was for the first year a team could have four points in the seventh inning and the game was over because you win the eighth and the ninth, you could only get two more points.\nYou need a comeback mechanic.\nI was writing and writing and writing and writing and I called our coaches.\nI go, I got it.\nThey go, what?\nI go the last inning, every run counts as a point.\nSo no matter what, the last inning, the ninth inning, if you score three or four runs, you can still come back and win.\nAnd it always comes down to the last inning.\nEvery game in Banana Ball always comes down to the last inning and being close.\nSo you destroy the blowout problem without eliminating the comeback mechanic that naturally exists in baseball.\nCorrect.\nAnd then we threw in one more final one on there.\nWe said, \"Well, what about getting your best hitter the opportunity to hit in the ninth inning no matter what?\"\nOh, the golden batter.\nThe golden batter rule.\nSo, your best hitter against your best pitcher.\nThat's action.\nAnd so, how do you make it the ninth inning, again, you talk about TV, a lot of your podcasts, you know, you talk about the TV rights, how big it is.\nThat's a whole another story how we're doing on YouTube, but how do you get people to want to watch to the end?\nNow, you have the ninth inning coming down to everything.\nA fan can catch a foul ball to win a game.\nYou have a golden batter who can come up, and the fans can even challenge a play.\nSo, literally, we have a fan challenge rule.\nIf the fans don't like a call, they can literally challenge the rule.\nSo, we built this and with 11 rules.\nAgain, 11's a big number for us.\nThe 11th letter of the alphabet is K, the symbol of potassium.\nWe have 11 rules in Banana Ball.\nWe have 11 fans first principles.\nWe count down from 11 every game.\n11's really big to us.\nSo, there's a little symbol there as well.\nSo, there you go.\nTaylor Swift has 13.\nBanana Ball has 11.\nThere you go.\nIt all started because of a banana.\nOkay.\nSo, you kind of have this idea that baseball can be more fun and that the Bananas should play a variant of baseball.\nWhat does it look like to leave a league and you know, you need someone to play and then tell your fan base, you thought we were wacky before like, well, people don't realize is we tested this in 2018.\nWe didn't leave the league until 2022.\nSo, in 2018, we we went to a small division 2 college.\nWell, first we went to Watford, my school, cuz my coach was like, \"Yeah, Jesse, we'll give it a shot in practice.\"\nAnd then we got rained out.\nSo people say rain out is a good luck, I guess.\nSo our first ever banana ball game got rained out.\nSo then I went to Lander cuz one of my other assistant coaches was there.\nHe's like, \"Jesse, we'll give it a shot.\"\nAnd so we told the guys, we didn't have a name for the game yet.\nWe were calling it like speedball or show ball.\nWe were messing around.\nAnd we played the game with them and it was behind closed doors except some of the girlfriends were there like watching and doing homework.\nAnd this was great cuz we played nine innings in 99 minutes.\nAnd the girlfriends were up on the edge of their seat watching.\nInstead of doing their homework, they're like, \"We've never watched practice or scrimmage.\nWe just come here to get be outside and do our homework.\"\nAnd we played nine innings, 99 minutes.\nAnd the guys said it was the most fun they've ever had playing baseball.\nAnd so that was in 2018 with college guys lander.\nIt wasn't until 2020 we played one in front of fans.\nSo you were workshopping for two years.\nWorkshopping playing regular conventional baseball.\nAnd then we did it 2020 again co year.\nWe were one of the few teams that we in Georgia, we had like a thousand people and they watched it.\nThe first play or the second play was a ball for sprint home run.\nIt just no one knew what to do.\nLike it was just chaos.\nIt was fast.\nIt was like an hour and 45, hour and 50.\nIt was exciting and we're like all right there's something here.\nTest it again.\nThen 2021 we're like let's just keep the Coastal Plane League team, the college summer team, but let's just do a one city world tour.\nSo I always believe in uh start small but think big.\nStart small, think big.\nSo we announced the one city world tour.\nNow again here's a little inside the business.\nSo again goes back to demand and that's part of our flywheel.\nSo we got live events drives content.\nContent drives traffic.\nTraffic drives demand.\nDemand forces you to do more live events.\nThat all goes together.\nSo if you push on the demand button that will push live events.\nLive events always drives content.\nContent drives outrageous traffic because the only way you can make revenue is live events.\nYou don't do live events.\nYou're not live events is everything.\nYeah.\nThat's it drives everything.\nI mean, obviously merchandise online is a bigger business than we ever anticipated.\nThat's downstream of live events and people seeing the game.\nExactly.\nSo, we announced the One City World Tour and the idea was no one wanted us.\nNo one knew what Banana Ball was, but could we get one city to want us and so we announced this and we said, \"We're going to go to one city.\"\nAnd I'll never forget the city of Mobile.\nThey were like interested.\nAnd again, Mobile was never on the radar, but the mayor had read my first book and he was a fan of what we're doing.\nAnd he goes, \"What?\nWhat will it take?\"\nAnd I go, \"What do you mean what it'll take?\"\nGo on.\nGo on.\nAnd he goes,\"Well, you know, I know it's co and there's challenges, you know, is there some form of investment?\"\nI go, \"What are you thinking?\"\nAnd so he threw out a small number and they got tourism involved and they just invested a little bit in it and we sold all the tickets and it's a 3500 seat stadium, something like that.\nYeah, it was it could have been five, but because of COVID, we were only allowed to do 3500 each night with some spreading out.\nSo, we said we need to do two nights.\nSo, we did 3500 each night, sold them out, and that started the business model.\nNow, the sound went out.\nI had our announcer try to sing the national anthem because the anthem singer got caught in traffic.\nHe couldn't make it because all the traffic.\nSo, when he went to sing the national anthem, I go, \"Shark, let's lead everybody.\nWe're back together here.\nLet's all sing the national anthem.\"\nAnd he goes, \"A 1, a two, a 1, 2, 3, 4.\nTake me out to the I go, Shark national anthem, please.\"\nSo that's how our first One City World tour started with a start of taking me out to the ball game into the national anthem.\nAnd at that time we were broadcasting ourselves too.\nWe were putting it up free on Facebook I think because we were trying to learn how to broadcast the game as well.\nSo a lot of things didn\n\n\nIt didn't go well, but fans showed up, and they stayed, and they were into it, and they were fired up. We're like, those two games proved, let's extend this a little more. And so that's when we said, \"All right, 2022, let's do seven cities, see where that is\" versus the Coastal Plain League team. And then we saw the success, and we said, \"2022, we have to leave and go all in.\" And seven cities.\n\nWhat type of ballparks are you playing in in those seven cities? Everything we do is a test for the future years. So we tested major league spring training homes. So we're like, could this help us get relationships with major league teams? Do it right. Do it well. Show that we can sell it out, get a good per cap for them, all of that. So we did West Palm Beach. And so we work with them, home of the Astros and the Nationals. And if you look last year, two of our first stadium we ever went to was Houston. We did the Rickwood before Major League did. So we the old ballpark in Birmingham, the old 8,000 seat oldest ballpark in America to create a story. So we did a few different places, but again, just found places that were interested in us, that were willing to say, \"Hey, we want to give you a shot.\" It was anybody that was willing, and then we had to prove our concept. So after we proved sold out all seven of those, then it started opening up pretty heavily.\n\nWas Major League Baseball starting to take notice? Because everyone who's a baseball fan who's listening to this will say, \"Wait a minute. Some of this stuff kind of started to show up in Major League Baseball a few years later.\" Like the pitch clock, is that at all motivated by the success of the Bananas?\n\nNo. I mean, I appreciate that, and I do hear that. Major League Baseball has a lot of smart executives and smart people on them, and it just takes time because they got to work with so many parties: the union, the owners, the commissioner's office, the... there's so many parties. It takes time. The Major League Baseball games are 3 hours and 12 minutes. Something had to happen. I may have seen it, but I think they knew they had to make the games faster. I think when you see more of the celebrating and when you start to see some trick plays coming into the game, I think that's coming player focused. I think people are starting to see that. That's the part of the game. That's how you get kids excited to play is you show them having fun. Like that's why we play it as a kids.\n\nOkay. On the player side, as you're transitioning to Banana Ball, and you know already you're becoming more popular, like how has player recruitment evolved? I assume you have a lot of people who want to play for you, but to play for the Bananas or the Party Animals or your other teams, you need to be multi-talented. You can't just be a good baseball player, right?\n\nLike, so yes, at first it was very hard to recruit players. So during this time before the 2022 tour, we convinced ESPN to do a series, The Banana Land, to do like a five episode series. It helped because we had Eric Burns, a former major leaguer. He was like, he's like, \"I'll give it a shot. I'll coach the guy.\" So, we had a kind of a character to coach, and we had like only 50 players show up for a try out for like two teams. Literally, most guys are going to make the team if you show up because it's weird. You're playing in the middle of the spring. It's only seven weekends. It was really hard. And you had some guys who played pro ball, you had some guys who played college, and some guys who played high school. There were no trick plays back then. Like, that didn't exist. It was just can you have fun? Can you dance? Or will you wear costumes? They were wearing costumes. Are you willing to not take yourself too seriously? And so that first try out was episode one, I think, of Banana Land. And one of the big things that happened was a young kid showed up. He was an average ball player. Hadn't played since high school. At the end of try out, he wasn't going to make it. He just wasn't good enough. And he came up to me and said, \"Hey, I got stilts. You want me to wear them?\" And I said, \"No, not really, unless you can hit in them.\" And he goes, \"I can hit in them.\" \"Yes, sir.\" I go, \"All right, get in the batters box. Let's see what you got.\" And I didn't know this. He had never hit in stilts ever. He actually hadn't worn stilts since he was like 12 years old. But his mother saw the try out, signed him up, and said, \"You got to go to this.\" And they said, \"They want you to be different and do things people have never seen before on a baseball field.\" Because that was my whole thing. I want to see things I've never seen before. He gets into the batters box, and he starts actually hitting the ball and hitting line drives. And everyone stops what they're doing. Like, it is just shock, disbelief. They're blown away. I mean, it is it is special. I'll never forget right afterwards, all the coaches got together and they said, \"We can't take him.\" I go, \"Guys, he hits on stilts.\" What do you mean you can't take him? They go, \"Well, he just can't play at this level. We don't have a roster spot.\" I go, \"Make a roster spot for him. I don't care what you call it. Call it the entertainment player.\" I go, \"I'm going to walk out. You guys figure it out.\" And I walked out. I came back and 20 minutes later, they said, \"Okay, we'll create this entertainment roster spot.\" And then Stilts became like the first big viral thing with what we were doing. And so, we started seeing those people show up. And then after that we started getting more more and better players and showing them, hey, you got to be entertained. You got to start doing trick plays. You got to show that. And so each year now we have first rounders, second rounders, third rounders. I mean, we have pro guys who just didn't make it, but they're right on that cusp. And that's who's now joined a lot of the banana ball teams.\n\nThe social media flywheel is helping here too, right? Like people are like, you're becoming bigger on social. Players are becoming bigger on social. People are seeing opportunity. Hey, like if I'm talented, I I should come do this.\n\n100%. Every night it was what can we show tonight that people had never seen on a baseball field before. And so every night we were trying to come up with things. So people don't realize we spent time the week before coming up with all the ideas. So we followed SNL. We studied the Saturday Night Live model of pitching, table reads, writing. We followed their model. And so we would come up with these ideas. We'd go into the games with 10, 15 ideas of things we want to do during the game. And if all we got to do is capture them. You got to rehearse them. You got to nail them. Capture them and put it out. Like that was our whole model. And immediately started getting a million followers, two million, and now you know 25, 26, 27. It just keeps growing. It's insane. And it's an interesting insight that most baseball players don't have a second great skill and they don't necessarily have the most charisma, but you need a couple of rosters full. And as your notoriety grows, it's pretty easy for you to field a team of all talented baseball players who all have crazy other skills. It's not like you need every baseball player to have that. You just need a couple rosters full. It's you're the average of the five people you surround yourself with. So, think about these guys. Every day they're surrounding themselves by people that are entertainers that are doing it at high level. Not just the baseball, but these guys have millions of followers on social media. You know, they have more followers than major league players. And so, they're seeing how to create content, how to do this. And we have a dance instructor, a choreographed dance instructor. He's our dancing first base coach, Macio. He's been with us many years. You know, he works with the guys daily. And I've watched guys who when they showed up couldn't dance. They'll go out to country bars and line dancing and they'll take over the whole dance floor. It is unbelievable to see because again it's just like working your ideal muscle. They've been working every day, every rehearsal they're learning dance moves, new dance moves that night that they have to perform and then the next night a whole other dance. So think about that. And so they're learning all this trick plays, dancing, social content, how to play banana ball, how to be fans first and go up to the crowd and deliver roses and do things every day. It's a different track. They're not just trying to be the best baseball player. They're trying to be the greatest entertainer, the most fans first. It's just a different thing we're teaching.\n\nAnd so at this point, had you created the Party Animals yet to create the the opponent for the Bananas?\n\nYeah, the Party Animals 2020. So we had to have another team for them to play. So in 2020, those first few games, they they started, but they were just the secondary brand. They were just quote unquote the underdog or even the villain at that point. But then they took off. So in 2023, they actually won the tour. That's when people call us the Harlem Globetrotters. I'm like, \"Guys, the Bananas don't win every game.\" In fact, this year in 2025, the Party Animals almost have been dominating. I mean, they have the first round picks. They hit home runs. They're just unbelievable. And so, they started creating a following. And what was wild is now they have over five, six million followers. They have more followers than every Major League Baseball team on TikTok. It's crazy. So, we tested last year their own tour. They sold it out. And now they have 21 game tour, sold it out. They have 500,000 people on their weight list because they've created their own identity of fun entertainment. They're the greatest party in sports and they're wearing like crop top like baseball uniforms. They're their own form of sacrilege.\n\nYes, they definitely uh go against the grain in many ways and it's fun to watch. You know, as you think about this, the Yankees when they have success, you have people start turning against them. And we've started seeing more hate towards the Bananas recently as we've got bigger, but now you have this other team or you have the firefighters or the tailgator or teams five, team six. So, we're trying to build this ecosystem of Banana Ball because we believe the game is truly entertaining. Take away all the dancing and entertainment. It's an awesome game to watch and we believe in it.\n\nHas anybody else ever blended entertainment and like actual sport like this?\n\nSport is entertainment. That's the whole thesis of all the episodes we've done on Acquired. But like it is a competitive sport that you guys are playing at a high level.\n\nYeah. So obviously the easiest is to look at it's WWE, but WWE scripts the outcomes. So that's where the biggest difference is, but I wrote this in the 2022. I wrote a vision for 2026 and I wrote a three-page thing and I shared it with our team and I talked about the Harlem Globetrotters and I said, \"Guys, right now that's the comparison we see and we have a runway, so did the Harlem Globetrotters in the 1940s.\" The Harlem Globetrotters played in front of 75,000 people in Berlin. The NBA was booking the Harlem Globetrotters to play so they would actually get fans to stay for the NBA game. Wilt Chamberlain chose the Harlem Globetrotters before going into the NBA. The Harlem Globetrotters beat the Lakers with George Mikan. The Harlem Globetrotters were playing competitive games all over. They were the biggest team in sports, bar none. They were biggest team in sports, arguably even bigger than the Yankees. They were huge. And then something happened. I don't think most people know that.\n\nNo, they don't. Then what happened?\n\nThey did something. Abe Saperstein, very unique owner, great promoter. He said, \"Ah, well, we can do this all over the world. Why don't we just make another Harlem Globetrotters team and then make another Harlem Charters team and we have three Harlem Charters playing everywhere and let's script it so we can control the outcomes and make it a great show every night.\" Like the traveling shows of like Broadway, you have a Broadway hit and then you do a second cast and that goes on the road.\n\nYeah. Yeah. 100%. And they dominated for years. The 40s, the 50s, they were rolling in it, dominating because it was still a new thing. And then the NBA started to take some of the fun things from the Harlem Globetrotters like through the legs, the entertainment of the game, made it more fun and they got the higher level ball players because of the competitiveness. The Harlem Globetrotters are no longer competitive. And then the Harlem Globetrotters, hey 100 years, I will always say a ton of respect. They are still in business. 100 years, very few businesses can do that. But not many people are wearing Harlem Globetrotter jerseys anymore because the relevance is not there. So, what I wrote in that piece, that three-page piece, was what if the Harlem Globetrotters created their own league in the 1940s? Would there be an NBA or would the Harlem Globetrotter League be the most entertaining competitive league in sports? And so, I said, \"We have a runway, but why don't we disrupt ourselves before we have to?\" Because that's what we did when the Coastal Plain League when we were playing college summer ball. We had won back-to-back championships. We had no cost. You couldn't pay the players back then. It was a great business model.\n\nOh, that's right. College summer leagues, you you actually can't pay the players because it's NCAA violations. Can't pay the players. Yeah. Great business model.\n\n\nIf you're selling tickets, great business model. We disrupted that to do something that no one was asking us for, and we went to it. Then, now no one was asking us for a league, but we said, \"What if we did it now and learn?\" And instead of everyone else who starts a league, think about any league that started over the last 30 years. Generally, if they start the league, they get a TV rights deal, they get sponsorship, and they say, \"Let's hope the fans come.\" But we got our money. This is IPL. Yeah, we got our money. You know, IPL does a great job, but some of the other ones that have started more recently in the last 10, 15 years. But even IPL, like the whole thing was the TV rights, like the TV rights and the jersey sponsorships. They knew they were going to get fans because it was just like the fans were so starved for cricket. But like, so our mindset is why don't we create the fans first? If the Savannah Bananas have 18 million on social media, the party animals have over five, the firefighters we just launched 12 months ago have over a million, the tailgators we just launched, they're growing like crazy. If you create the fans first, then focus on everything else, could you have a more sustainable league in the future? And that was the mindset.\n\nAll right. Here's an interesting, you have an opinion on this, I'm sure, because you have taken a side. All big successful sports leagues, every team is owned by a different owner. Is it better or worse for the game and for the competition of the league that you own all the teams? We think about that regularly. So, a single entity, will there be the storylines? Everyone cares about story. That's where this is going to drive. We got the entertainment. I believe in the game, but it's going to come down to storylines. So, you got to create coaches, the Deion Sanders effect, you know, you got to create coaches that are the heroes and the villains. Yeah. Storyline in the sense that they're going to be the one talking. They're the one going to be doing all this getting people fired up. And so, we think about that. And there's a few other ideas. Obviously, there's some things that the Premier League, Indian Premier League do that's very interesting on Korean storylines, which you know, we may look into. You've got to create that. So, I think it will be hard, but we will be able to control the experience, the end to end better and not let another owner do something that might not be truly fans first because every other owner would say TV rights sponsorship. We're going to charge ticket fees. What do you mean we're going to charge taxes for our fans? Why are you paying all the taxes? Like, that is crazy. We pay all the taxes on every merchandise item, every ticket item. That is crazy. They would do it for short-term revenue, but we're focused on long-term fans over short-term profits. It's a big difference. The other thing that your model benefits from is you can never have an owner of a really successful team who then wants to lock in their advantage. You economically don't care which of these teams becomes the most successful as long as the game stays competitive. Each team is accruing a bunch of fans. It's fun to watch and competitive on the field. Like you're more invested in the sport than any given team, which is different than other other sports leagues. I mean, can each team upscale? So, like for instance, can the party animals start selling out major league stadiums? And my thought would be yes. Could each team start selling out? Could not just the Savannah Bananas go to Mexico or go to Australia or go to Japan and sell out? And so, you start building that where it creates more excitement and demand. It's not just one team.\n\nSo, okay, catch us up. You're selling out football stadiums now. What did the next few years look like?\n\nWell, that's been hard, just so you know. I bet. So, at first, we weren't sure we could do major league stadiums. Major League stadiums, all of them have exclusive ticket deals. This is what we foreshadowed earlier. We built our own ticket platform. And by exclusive ticket deals, you mean like Ticket Master or another platform have the exclusive rights to all events. Ticket Master, Tickets.com, Seek, they have all these every single event they have. And so we weren't sure we would be able to do this. We had to find a way in and basically say, \"We're not competing. Every ticket sold in advance. You can still sell some of the premium suites on yours. We're going to sell it.\" So, we found a few that said, \"We'll do it. Find that right precedent.\" We found that right precedent. And then we said, \"All right, well, if something happened where we couldn't work with Major League Baseball anymore, what else do we have to grab onto?\" And no one's really looking at football stadiums at all. And I've always learned from Sam Walton, go where others won't go. Kmart and Sears were obsessed with going to the cities where everyone was, and Sam goes, no, we're going to go to these suburbs where no one is right now, and we're going to build it such a great experience. Obviously IKEA has followed that model and so and so and so go where others won't go. We can go to every city in the country, small cities, big cities, but it's not just baseball stadiums. We said what if we experimented with going to a football stadium with banana ball? Could it be a great show? We got one that was all in and they set a deal for us that was a great deal, a great precedent. We said, \"Let's do it. You build the field. We'll take care of the netting. We sell all the tickets. There's no rent. Let's find a deal that works out. You'll make all the food and bev etc.\" And so that's one of the things people realize. Don't pay rent anywhere we go, but they make huge money on food and pav and some of the premium tickets. And teams are now using the ability for their fan base or, you know, customer base to have access to Savannah Bananas tickets as a like selling point, right? And think about this. So we went to Clemson, 60% 50,000 people came from outside of the state of South Carolina to Clemson. Talk about economic impact. And so we're seeing that everywhere we go. So cities, tourism now want to invest because when we come in, people are coming in for this bucket list trip because there's 3 million people on the wait list. If you get a chance to go, we're fortunate people are coming.\n\nYou're the era's tour of sports.\n\nWell, I would never. She's the best there is. So we said, could it work at a football stadium? And we went to Clemson, 81,000 fans, 190 ft down the field line. There were 11 home runs, but the game was played in an hour and 43 minutes and it was one of the most exciting banana ball games we've ever had. And I was like, heck yes. And since then, we've heard from every stadium over 100,000.\n\nIs the left field outfield wall like ridiculously far?\n\nOh yes. One's like 350 down the line and one is like 200 down the line and then we have a 50ft net. Oh, it's crazy. I mean, it's it's it's laughable cuz in the old days when they had municipal stadiums, they would sort of accommodate where you could push out one of the walls for baseball and Yep. No, we we can't move anything at football stadiums. No, it's just, hey, here's the field. Let's put the field in. Here's a giant net and let's do it. And and again, we found a partner, Netting Pros, that would say, hey, we'll supply the net. We'll do some partnerships. That was a unique partnership that we were able to make work. And it worked. And then we did Nissan and Tennessee and and we're doing two at the Panther Stadium in Charlotte. And so now we have a lot of opportunities looking in the future.\n\nYour business requires way less risk and way less operating capital and it's much more asset light than traditional sports businesses because you have this advantage like this leverage where you can say look people really really really want to see the Savannah Bananas. They can't see them in their city. I bet I can lure close to 100,000 people into this stadium to have a unique amazing experience. You should give me the stadium for free. And people go they're not using it. You know, you're looking at these assets. We've often called a circus. PT Barnum 146 years of touring and now they went out for a few years. Now they're back. You know, touring model can work if you minimize your expenses. But we travel with 200 plus people. So when you talk about minimizing expenses, comparison, the Globe Trotters travel with 30. We travel with 200 to 220. We do the whole broadcast, both teams, all the entertainment. We hire three to 400 locally nano scanners, people in banana costumes scanning your tickets. We hire people to do merchandise. It's very big operation. It costs each person that travels 35 to $40,000 a year in just travel expenses for each person. So if you're traveling with 200 people, that's a huge expense. But we believe in doing the unscalable to make sure they feel our presence there from everything. Our entertainment, our cast, I mean, we travel with a whole cast. I mean, you name it, our dancers, our bands, everything. And so that's worth it for us. There's different models. We spend more here. We spend less here. But also, we pay the players dramatically more than minor league baseball. Not even close. The average minor league player is making not even like there's caps on this stuff. I remember like from my family did like minor league players you you get a signing bonus when you get drafted, but then your salary is like if you're lucky, poverty line, you know, if you're lucky. Yeah. They increased it like AAA is like 35,000 and you help out there. But like you know we have numerous players and I mean most players in the future are six figures plus and so you get paid well and they play half the games. We only play on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, maybe a Thursday. No Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays. So we try to put our money into our people into the experience and not put the money in things like a rent or something that we can't actually make a huge impact with.\n\nAll right. So I'm dense. Help me understand this. You're paying your players like three times as much. What's the top line that supports that? Where's all the profitability come from that allows you to invest in your players more because you don't have sponsorships? So, you sell 2.2 million tickets. Ticket prices are between $35 and $60. So, major league stadiums, football stadiums, $60 for the lower bowl, 50 for the middle, 40 for the top. And then merchandise, we're very fortunate. That is our model. So, we can serve 15 to 20,000 people per game of merchandise. In a football stadium, it could be even more. So, like at a major league stadium, you can look at 15,000 people, you know, which is 40% 50% are buying merch, not just for themselves, but potentially they buy multiple items. I mean, you've seen the numbers on the Masters, obviously, what they do in 4 days. We're not like that, but it's a big part of our business. Um, and we keep our prices low. A $30 shirt is $30 with no tax and no extra fees.\n\nSo, what did you say the tier pricings are for football stadiums?\n\n40, 50, and 60.\n\nMy god, go to an NFL game. like you're not getting a $40 ticket anyway. Yeah. And a $60 ticket is $60. And so what's the challenge for us and the next fans first thing we got to figure out is the secondary market. People look at us, I hear every day, your tickets are the most expensive in the world. And that probably makes you crazy. There's memes of me behind bars, guys, and saying Jesse Cole should be put in jail for his ticket pricing. The secondary market, how much do you think StubHub, Vivid Seat, Seek invest to be the top tier on Google? I bet you it's millions of dollars. And so even though you have your own ticketing platform, you still can't totally control second dairy market. No, because it's speculative. So what'll happen on October 9th, we do a world tour draft, which this is one of my favorite events. So most teams, they do a schedule release. We actually make it into a live event. So we had fans flying from 38 states to find out where we're going to play. And we make it a huge big event, very Steve Jobs, Mac World. I want to make it big. We announced the new teams that night. There are no tickets available except on all those secondary websites. There's thousands of fake tickets, speculative tickets that are being sold for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. That night, our lottery list opens. Two million people will join the lottery list in 48 hours. But everyone else who just searches tickets or banana ball tickets, they see all those and then they're buying fake tickets. Oh, so they're not even real tickets. They're speculative. Every night we have people fly into town, show up, and that morning they got their tickets. They said, \"Sorry, these weren't real tickets.\" They brought their whole family. And so every night we have to figure out how to take care of them fans first, whether it's standing room or do something every single night. So we're going to figure out how to solve this problem. We got some ideas. So average ticket price on the secondary market is $300 plus dollars. So that's what we could charge tickets for, but we don't. That's a big problem we're trying to solve.\n\nIs it just cuz those websites allow you to list tickets without verifying that you actually have the tickets?\n\nCorrect. We've actually seen this for our upcoming Radio City show. I logged on to secondary a non- ticket master secondary site and I looked at a seat and it was very expensive and I thought, \"Huh, I know for a fact there is going to be a camera in that seat. That seat is actually not available. I sure hope no one pays $1,000 for that seat.\"\n\nThere you go. There you go. So again, it's part of the model. We're going to get there. It just takes time.\n\n\nYeah. So, okay, tell us about broadcast. Like, what is your broadcast and meteorite strategy? So, again, put yourself in the fan shoes. What do people hate about broadcast? Commercials. Nobody likes commercials. So, how could we create an ad-free experience? What else do people hate? Pay walls. Where's the game on? I don't know. Peacock, HBO, I don't know. God bless it. I I understand the NFL, NASCAR, like I have so much respect and admiration. They are maximizing every opportunity and they're learning from it. It's great for us. I'm putting myself in our fan shoes. It's like, what if we keep every game for free on YouTube? Every single game. Now, there is very little money on YouTube. I mean, we're talking hundreds of dollars a game. Very, very little. But for the fans makes it easy. And so I believed that at some point we could have games on national networks, but only if it was on our terms. And so the first few years talking to all these groups, they were like, \"No, it's exclusive. We've never done it that way.\" I go, \"Well, we'll only do it if it's not exclusive.\" And they go, \"We're offering you this much money.\" I go, \"Doesn't matter. We're good. Our business is not built on that. We're profitable and successful and healthy based on tickets and merchandise.\" So I said, \"No, you've never taken equity capital and you've never raised debt. This is a no debt-free business that you operate.\" It's my wife and I. We have the team. Like that's it. So we just kept saying no. And finally they were like, \"We can't ignore you guys anymore.\" That was actually how I got the phone call from the National Baseball Hall of Fame aside. They said, \"We can't ignore the Savannah Bananas anymore. We have to put you guys in the Hall of Fame.\" I was like, \"This wasn't how I this wasn't how I expected to get that call.\" But it was it was uh fun fact they guys they have the original idea book where I I wrote the rules. I called show ball back then and it's got even the golden batter which we didn't introduced to last year but a lot of the original rules are in there and it's got you know some really cool things. But anyways ESPN and some of these others said we can't ignore you. And I said guys we have to keep it we have to keep it on YouTube. They said we've never done anything like that. I go well. And they said all right I guess we can make the exception. And they made the exception. So, they're paying you for broadcast rights that they're going to put on their apps and ecosystems. They're going to run ads against or they're going to monetize however they're going to monetize. And you are broadcasting the exact same games ad free on YouTube. So, every game is on YouTube. So, all the promotions, the in between, the halftime shows that we do, you can watch on YouTube or you can watch on ESPN and there'll just be some commercials filled in it. So, we were able to hold our ground and now we have same thing with TNT and some others we're about to announce. It's been a long process and we still spend millions of dollars on a broadcast. Like the broadcasting itself right now is not making money. We're investing $5 million plus just this year alone building control rooms. We have multiple tours going on. So, it's not covering itself yet, but it will and it's best for fans. Does the broadcast partner take your media feeds or do they bring in their own duplicative cameras and crews and control rooms? Here's a funny story. So, our first game on ESPN, this was 2022 and this was when we were still working on it. They brought in a crew from the outside. All right. This wasn't ESPN, but they brought in a crew to help do it. And the first hitter struck out in 10 seconds. So, three pitches in 10 seconds. The guy directing it is sweating bullets. He goes, \"I can't do this. This is too fast. I can't.\" Because they're used to a baseball game. Stepping out of the box, adjust the batting gloves, you know, do that. So, we had an intern, a seasonal person step in and start leading that show. And now we're like, we just got to do this in-house. And so, now we've built it all. BTV, we've built it all in house. Whoa. And so when it's broadcast on these partners, it's using the output of your control room. It's our entire It's our entire team. And but guys, we have failed every step of the way. That's not how the NFL works. No. Most most places they have. I mean, some like I think UFC does their own. I think some do their own, but a lot of times it's all hired out. It's just too expensive. It doesn't make sense. Yeah. Fox and CBS are coming in and doing the NFL and it's astronomical. But people don't realize this. our first game on prime time ESPN, not ESPN 2 last year. The transmission went out for the first 10 minutes. So, the ESPN anchors were like, \"Go to YouTube.\" Well, looks like the bananas can't handle us right now. And we finally got back on and it was buffering and we were struggling. My point is, we failed every step of the way. Just people don't remember the failures because we move on to the next at bat. Our first shipment of t-shirts, guys, had too many N's in bananas. We misspelled our own name with our first shipment of t-shirts.\nOur first major league game, our ticket system got hacked and so literally our ticket system in Houston got hacked. It wasn't working the whole night. I was like, \"We're done. We're never doing a major league game again.\" It got hacked. Cyber attack people on the ground. It was crazy. But like we have failed every step of the way, but we're willing to get to the next bat. And I think that's where it's like all this, you know, we don't know how to do all this. We're learning it. So what's the vision for broadcast going forward? Again, and the vision that I wrote in 2022 was like, well, how do you create a broadcast that again is mustwatch? It's not just the game, you know, could every player be miked up? You have your favorite player that you could be tuned in. What are these other things that can make the game so interesting? Because right now, I believe people are bigger fans of individuals than they are teams. It's becoming that way because as individuals, Jackson Olsson's got a couple million followers. KJ Jackson, Coach Rack, it's like, how do I get a full access of watching him? And there's these different ways. So, we need to learn how to do that. That's going to take a couple years. All these ways of looking at it. We just want to control it so we can learn faster. And that's that's the model. You are leaving money on the table and profit dollars on the table everywhere. Yeah. CFO's hand. And I get the sense you are aware of this and love this because there's two ways of saying it. One, it's for the fans. It's your northstar. All that is true. But two, man, does this build sort of a stored potential energy into Banana Ball as a sport, into these teams, into the the relationship with the fan, into NPS. You're charging up a massive battery right now in the profit dollars you choose not to collect.\nI mean, I think that's part of it. I mean, what's so great is to see our fans defend us when any people get after us. I tell our team, don't write back. Let our fans defend us. Let our fans back us up because that's powerful. And what we've been doing behind closed doors as well, we haven't promoted it. We have a K club. Again, K symbol potassium. We have thousands of members. Thousands. I we haven't released numbers yet, but it's growing. We don't advertise or promote it, but it's your way to guarantee tickets to any game and you're part of this community on Facebook and they talk and they share everything and we do special things for them. We get to have special meetups and all this. We're building this loyal bigger than any season ticket holder base, you know, in the country. And now it's all over the country, this K club group. They pay $59 a year and they get complete access and they they can get any ticket they want to any game. And it's all part of this. There's so many elements even before you said the membership thing I was going to say there's so many elements of Costco here where you are minimally value extractive. It's the idea of shared economies scaled or scaled shares economies where you're passing as much as possible on to the fans and trying to build this durable relationship that they're super big fans of. And we've shared that Costco episode from you guys with our whole staff and just the fact that they were even literally processing their own. They went all the way in to control it to keep that hot dog at $1.50 and keep the chickens at their price. They went all the way. And so there'll be a point where we do that with merchandise. We're already doing it with with with TV tickets. We're already doing it, but we need to figure out the secondary market. So you'll play the long game. If the company is healthy enough, me and Emily don't need we're not in an airb anymore. We have a real bed. We're happy. Okay. We don't need any. We don't have to appease any shareholders. We don't need to appease any investors. So, if we have minimal profits every year, but we're doing things for the long game, it it's going to win in the end, and that's what we believe in. I don't even need to ask you the question. Like, I know that, you know, you're you're doing this for the rest of your life. I can't imagine you doing anything else with your days. You're not looking to exit or like maximize short-term profits. So, like, why wouldn't you operate this way? I want this for my grandkids. I want to create something that we love. It's all about chasing moments, guys. You bring people together. Like there's nothing like it when you see after a game thousands of people singing Stand by Me, which out of all things, it's wild. They feel like they're a part of something. It's those moments that I'm chasing, that energy. And so, why would you ever give it up? So, we're going to keep building. And each team has their own moments that they're creating. I mean, seeing a football stadium, 80,000 people, and everyone's got their flashlights on their phone, and everyone's singing yellow, look at the stars. Look how they shine for you. It sounds kumbaya. I get it. But every night, I get goosebumps. And when I was at Fenway Park, which you know, I grew up south of Boston, a dream to pitch at Fenway. And I looked around 38,000 people at Fenway all singing yellow. I was like, there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be. And I think that's what our fans feel like. Well, you do pitch at Fenway now. Just a different definition of pitch. Different way. You PT Barnum pitch at Fedway. Well, Jesse, I know we got to let you go. David and I cannot wait. He's going to come up to Seattle for the T-Mobile Park game. I don't know how many you're doing here in September. I can't wait. It's got to be fun. We'll get you guys there early so you can see the full show cuz we get we start early. I mean, it's entertain always. There's like a parade and starts like 2 p.m., right? 2 p.m. And yeah. Yeah. Just you'll get your steps in. It'll be it'll be worth it, though. Amazing. Can't wait. Amazing. Can't wait. All right, everyone. Jesse Cole listeners, we'll see you next time. We'll see you next time.\n",
