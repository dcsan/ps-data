  "cleanText": "[Music]\nWelcome to the Agent State.\nMy name is Karan Karia.\nI'm here with my co-host Fed.\nAnd I'm very happy to introduce our two guests for today, Akshit, Co-Founder of Epoch Protocol, and RG, Core Contributor at Reppo.\nWelcome guys.\nThanks for having us.\nYeah.\nSo let's just jump into it.\nUh, let's, let's start with, you know, who you guys are, what you guys are working on, and what you guys find interesting about the space right now.\nUh, RG, do you want to kick things off?\nYeah, sure thing.\nUm, yeah, I'm RG.\nI used to work at Protocol Labs scaling Filecoin uh, for a couple years.\nUh, and specifically within Filecoin, I was leveraging AI to um, uh, help, you know, uh, storage providers, um, help figure out, you know, how can they deal with incentives abuse.\nSo, you know, if you know much about Filecoin, there's a lot of um, you know, uh, incentives involved to onboard data, and just like any, you know, ecosystem, when there are incentives, there are incentives to abuse uh, those incentives.\nUm, so yeah, we were leveraging kind of um, AI and machine learning to predict which uh, data onboarders are uh, kind of bad actors and which storage providers might be bad actors.\nUh, and from there, I just realized that, you know, this can be a separate thing by itself.\nUh, at the time, Agents was not really like a big thing.\nThis is like 2024, Jan 2024.\nUm, so yeah, we started out as building out, you know, when we started Reppo, we were actually building out like a risk and reputation protocol uh, for DeFi.\nUm, and we quickly realized that um, that market was like a little small, and I can dive into later why, but uh, yeah, that's been my journey and my background.\nSo we spun out of Protocol Labs.\nProtocol Labs is technically a co-founder in Reppo.\nUm, and yeah, it's been an awesome journey.\nNice.\nAkshit, do you want to, you want to go from there?\nYep.\nYep.\nSo, I'm Akshit.\nI also go by AK to some of my friends, the Eastern friends, investing friends out there.\nYeah.\nUh, and I started my journey in Crypto back in 2018.\nUh, with AI itself.\nSo, my first company was an edtech AI company.\nI was working in machine learning and deep learning with that product.\nUh, it was pre-ChatGPT, pre-AI era in 2018.\nI was building our own NLP algorithm.\nUh, had to shut down that company due to COVID, started a second web company uh, called uh, Orange Wallet, which was a mobile wallet, scaled it up.\nUh, then later on, it got acquired by a decentralized exchange, and now I'm working on Epoch Protocol, which is a universal coordination layer for solvers and Agents out there, where we're coordinating between multiple intent solvers, Agents, and taking users from any state in web3 to any other state in web3 in all seamless transaction in a single transaction, completing like crosschain, cross abstraction, and all account abstraction things as well.\nSo yeah, our journey has been so far really ups and downs for sure.\nYeah, super interesting.\nSo I, I guess to, like, you know, to set a baseline, like, maybe we can talk about where you guys see the Crypto-AI space right now.\nUm, you know, obviously you guys have a lot of uh, experience, like, seeing the ups and downs of the space, but I guess to set a baseline of, like, you know, there are maybe like four or five different ways the two industries interact.\nUm, maybe we can start with, like, you know, how each of your projects touch on those various spaces, and um, you know, how you're kind of, you know, maybe touching different parts of the stack.\nUh, Akshit, do you want to start with that one?\nYep.\nSo firstly, for where this industry is heading on to.\nSo the moment when I started, like, step foot in the web3, it was super early.\nUh, not a lot of people in web3, everyone, like, there were only two or three bigger chains outside, that's it, like Polygon, Ethereum, uh, and mainnet mostly, and then that was all familiar in this Indian ecosystem, and then other chains keep on building and then keep on coming.\nUh, it was that, like, the transition where people are just trying to understand what web3 is, what decentralization is, decentralization is, what is decentralized storage, boosting, and every sort of things.\nUh, so I believe that every trend that starts, every technical trend that start follows a curve, uh, where it's all bottom in the really start of the years.\nSo it was that time in 2017, 2018, 2019, and then the first boom happened with NFTs and DeFi and all sort of things where people started getting into crypto, all for finance, that's it, nothing apart from finance, only for making money, quick trades through either through NFTs or from yield or anything like that.\nThen right now, it's at the curve where it's getting in, like, it's at the intersection of the real-world use case, which is also required out there, people can also understand, and what web3 is also capable of.\nSo it's also decentralization, permissionless governance, and all sort of things.\nNow it's all intersecting with AI use cases.\nSo real-world use cases with RW and all sort of things.\nSo even the layman can start using web3 and can start understanding without depending on understanding what the core background of how a blockchain works, how a transaction happens, all sort of things.\nThe normal user doesn't have to know all this stuff right now.\nThey can just go to any DApp, they can understand basic finances, and then this AI thing that's coming into web3 is also simplifying a lot of things for the users.\nSo it's moving for the mass adoption according to me right now.\nIt started with the developer adoption first, and now it's moving for the mass adoption with the consumer-facing adoptions and the retail-facing adoption.\nThat's where I figure think that the industry is going to.\nUh, what was the next question that you asked?\nSorry.\nYeah.\nLike how does, you know, what you're doing, or like what part of the stack does, you know, what Epoch Protocol is doing, and like maybe we can just talk about, like, kind of your interests and and what you're, what you're kind of like focused on.\nBut, um, like what part of the stack, uh, is it touching in terms of crypto and AI, and how they intersect, and you know, there's, there's, there's many different use cases and like how they interact, but you know, what, what kind of part of the stack are you guys focused on?\nYep.\nSo Epoch Protocol uh, works in the Infrastructure layer for everything that's going out in web3, whether it's for non-AI stuff or AI stuff.\nWe are building this API and SDK with deep protocol, which can take users from any state to any state in web3.\nSo for example, if a user has their funds on any exchange, like Optimism, and some stable coins, and they want to invest their funds on some other chain, for example, Polygon or Solana, in some betting marketplaces, prediction market, games, anything right now, they have to go through multiple steps, like swap, bridge, then again interacting with the DeFi protocol, DApp protocol, smart contracts, and all sort of things.\nUh, we simplify all the things with our uh, coordination layer.\nSo where we coordinate and find and optimize route for users to go from state A to state B, much like Google Maps, where viewpoint, like, okay, I'm at this bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, and I want to go to city center, NYC, how do I reach there?\nSo it will go out and find the all out, like, go through all the bridges, solvers, swaps, DApps, and everything, and get you to the right place.\nNow, how it plugs into AI as well is that there are two kind of AI models in Agents out there right now.\nOne is the super advanced one which goes out and track and explore all the DeFi activities, all the onchain and option activities, and find the best results for you.\nFor example, if you asked an AI Agent to find the best yield providing asset across five different chains, this advanced AI model will go out and find the best providing asset, for example, XYZ coin on Z on Z chain, right now.\nHow do you reach from your current wallet position to this position where you have interacted with the smart contract of this XYZ protocol on Z chain, have staked this asset, that's where Epoch comes in.\nSo AI Agent just need to understand and inference this user request, maybe gather the data on their own by the onchain or the offchain analytics, and give us this intent that users starting from Xcoin and Bchain and then needs an open push on Y protocol on XYZ chain.\nEpoch handle the rest of the stuff where we can go out and build the whole route for the users and for the wallets that this Agents are using.\nThey just need to use that call data, do a signature, and then we carry forward all the user onboarding and everything over there.\nUh, the second part, uh, which is like, which are basic Agent which only works on chat, which can only do trans, like, interpretations, and that's it.\nUh, those can directly give us the intent, and we have the whole network where we can also optimize for user transaction.\nFor example, AI Agents can directly give us an intent.\nFind me the best yield providing asset across XYZ chains, and we'll go out and find the best heal providing assets.\nPlus, we'll also give you the RFQ and the route and everything.\nSo, you just need to call our API, get the RFQs, present it to the user base.\nIf users respond yes, then you can just use a call data and then onboard user to that platform.\nIt's that easy.\nSo, that's how we are leveraging between the Infrastructure layer for the DeFi apps, wallets out there, and also with AI Agents.\nI, I have a million questions there, but um, yeah, I'll keep them for after.\nI'm curious to hear also what RG is working on.\nAnd yeah, Karan, after we ask RG, we can go down the rabbit hole of like a uh, web3 intents uh, autonomous Agents.\nWe have a bunch of things we can talk about there.\nYeah, definitely.\nAnd I think like both of you guys are working on like intents and intent solvers, and so I think there's a lot to to go into there, but yeah, RG, do you want to maybe, maybe kind of introduce what you guys are doing, and then we can can get into like the the details.\nUh, sure thing.\nYeah.\nUm, so you know, when I think of the Crypto into AI space, I broadly uh, break it down into, yeah, you know, like two chunks.\nSo like there's a developer side of the house, and then there's the user side of the house.\nI think for the developers, um, intents, um, and you know, just having kind of frictionless, more frictionless experiences and uh, is kind of really like, you know, what makes uh, kind of crypto into interesting because like, well, that's what makes AI interesting to developers, right?\nI mean, the reason why I, my, from my perspective, AI is interesting, if you know, because it basically takes off like this uh, operational tasks and work.\nUm, so I think uh, so from the developer perspective, it's literally just like bringing AI to crypto.\nYou know, we, we're not there where like, we're talking about, you know, like the developer doesn't care about verifiability, right?\nThe developer doesn't care about like a lot of these like, um, yeah, like, you know, novel, um, unlocks, and then there's the user side, which, you know, you have the verifiable pieces, and you know, making sure that uh, the output or the outcome that you're consuming is right.\nUm, so yeah, I think that's how I think about it.\nUm, I still believe that the main value add of crypto uh, in the world of AI is incentives.\nWhen we started out Reppo, we were building this incentive for uh, you know, AI developers to build risk and reputation models.\nUm, you know, the ambition was to build a decentralized Moody's or you know, S&P 500, and if you think about it, it's still undisrupted, those um, I think it's Moody's, S&P 500, and uh, there's one more big player, I think Fitch Ratings.\nThey have combined revenue of $20 billion a year.\nUm, and uh, I think what we realized is that you have to break the developer, developer stack, well, developers into like three chunks, or at least that's how I do it.\nSo you have the top of the top developers, right?\nWho are really smart.\nUm, they are going to go work at the top AI labs, right?\nThey're not uh, screwing around like farming for crypto tokens or incentives.\nUm, or you know, there's also the top ones are just going to contribute for free on Hugging Face or open source, like they're not really interested unless like, you know, like they're earning like a Bitcoin a day to like, you know, um, do something for tokens.\nThen you have this middle layer, which are people kind of not good enough to, you know, build specialized AI models using specialized data, um, but also not good enough to like, or but also not like motivated enough that they would spend their weekend, you know, learning a new thing from scratch, and then you have like the very bottom, um, sort of, you know, like not the bottom, I would say, like, you know, like below that, where you have the VIP coders, people who are like, wow, I have these new powers now, uh, what can I do with it?\nAnd for the longest time, I think the mistake we did initially was we were targeting the middle, um, assume, you know, and thinking that we were like, we can get to the top, but the reality is, it's very, very hard to crack that.\nI mean, you know, AI, Meta, and Google are like already fighting for those top people, and to expect that, you know, these people will come to our decentralized AI modeling layer and try to like build specialized models is like sort of, you know, living in like, you know, like a dream.\nUm, so I think what we realize is that, okay, what we really need to do is define that user base, right?\nAnd I think that's what we've done at Rebo.\nUm, our user kind of buckets that we define it are AI Agents as well as VIP coders.\nUm, and so uh, really uh, so what we're building now is a the a platform where VIP coders and AI Agents can discover and access data, infra, capital on demand.\nUm, so data and infra is kind of where intents come in.\nIt's nothing too fancy.\nUh, we're using a Nomo stack to build, build this middle middleware layer.\nUm, so that, you know, Agents don't really have to care about plugging into an L1 or working with, you know, a specific uh, provider.\nAll they have to say is like, hey, I'm looking for like, you know, Nvidia H100's for the next three months.\nUh, this is my budget.\nUh, find me that.\nUm, and discoverability is a big challenge.\nUm, and then similarly, like, from a data perspective, right now, uh, you know, DHSH from Agent.AI wrote about this last in in April, mid-April, how discoverability and consumability is a big challenge for MCPS, um, because, you know, everyone has a server, but, you know, there's just like one client sometimes.\nUm, so yeah, that's a big challenge.\nSo that, that's really what we're solving from a data and infra perspective.\nUh, it's called reppo.exchange.\nUm, and you know, the goal there is, yeah, anyone can come in, human, AI, eventually physical AI, and they can just say, hey, in plain English, in natural language, they can say, this is what I want, um, and they can essentially, um, discover that and consume that, and then finally, yeah, go ahead, sorry, yeah, I do have a lot of questions here.\n\n\nUm is similar, so it's a marketplace for GPUs or something different. So it is a marketplace in the sense that, uh, but we're not basically building like this. We're like a layer abstracted from the P2P marketplace. So when you think of a marketplace, you know, like it will be like Spheron or like, you know, Hyperbolic, like that's what they're doing. They're bringing GPU providers, and then they're bringing people who, who basically, yeah, want it. But it's still very much like you have to come to Hyperbolic or you have to come to, right, to consume it. What we're building is this, this layer on top, which is a network of solver nodes. Uh, so you, Fed, can be running a solver node, which is optimized to take in certain requests. So let's say, you know, you are saying that, hey, I have really good relationships with people who have H100s, um, and I can take in, you, you're basically acting as this decentralized middle, middleman, um, instead of, you know, the person who wants the H100s, they having to, them having to go to like explore 10 different options and, you know, like discover like what's the best price out there, they can basically come to Reppo, which acts as this like extraction layer, and when they put in a request, they don't even know like, you know, like it's going to go to your solver node. It go, it might go to current solver. Yeah. So that's kind of, okay, that's super awesome. It kind of like a, let me understand if I read this correctly, but it's almost like open router routing to, uh, OpenAI, Antropic, and so you're like this router for the pin services. So far, you mentioned Hyperbolic, there's a million, uh, Jensen, Akash, uh, I like a, they're popping up like mushrooms now. And, um, yeah, and interestingly, I've seen, I, I was looking at their, um, AR. They're in, they're crazy, but nobody really shares their AR in a public, uh, cuz they, they're decentralized. I mean, they're in the crypto space, but their, uh, data is proprietary and their own, uh, uh, data is private. So they, and by the way, I'm friendly with all of them, so I don't want to throw them under the bus, but a lot of the data that they're sharing, they're, it's not on chain, so there's no verifiability on, on that. I wonder from your side, if you being decentralized, if you actually can talk about eventually on like seeing the actual data of like how many users are using this, cuz, um, yeah, there's, and this comes from, uh, I'm plugging both world, the web three and the AI, and also in the cross of web three and AI, and what I mean for both, I mean, with the AIC event, we're only AI, so I see the people only from AI angle, uh, and conference, then I go, they're all AI, and then I'm in the web3 space with all the web three companies, etc. And the, there's like a lot of, uh, uh, lack of trust, especially from the AI people to crypto and lack of reputation. Unfortunately, we ruin, you know, with, uh, all the scams now. It's very, uh, we have a harder time to convince that, uh, AI and crypto are meant to work together, but it, it takes a time. So I think it would be very interesting to, and this probably is a suggestion, or if you're doing that, um, having public, uh, transparent, uh, data on like, uh, what users are using, like open router does a really good job in, um, sharing, uh, uh, how many tokens, how much dollars are spent at each type of model. And so they have like millions of tokens used, and they shared that at the AI engineering conference, and it's interesting because you can start like getting some insight, like, uh, uh, you can see the different waves of, um, LLM coming up, like, uh, Gemini 2.5 Pro, when come up, quickly become the top used one, before that, set 37 was the most used one, and then deep, there was a moment that free, so everyone was using that. So, and I think could be very valuable to know, um, where the market goes, and that could be a really good indication to know, like, okay, we're moving from the hyperscaler scale, um, OpenAI, etc., using their own private data center to now users are actually using the team for real. So that, that could be really interesting, I think. And yeah, I think there's a lot to, you know, unpack there, right? So I think you identified this correctly. It is an orchestration framework network, um, that we're building, and an orchestration network, really. Um, and I think what you picked on is actually really, really interesting. So we've actually had clients, uh, who've told us that they're willing to pay for analytics around what people want, not necessarily what is satisfied, right? So we call them RFDs or request for data, request for infra, RFI, RFDs. And yeah, exactly what you said. Um, right now, we live in a world from my perspective, and I'm a bit scarred from my time at Filecoin, where it's a supply intensive world, right? You have a lot of supply, even though it might not look like it, at least in the data storage, for sure, I can say that with confidence, maybe not in compute, um, but I think the demand was lacking, definitely in the decentralized storage world, right? And so I think what we realized, okay, let's instead of like having the, um, yeah, instead of just having, you know, like suppliers compete with each other, you know, they should compete with each other, you know, to satisfy, to, to satisfy demand, right? So what we really mean by that is, let's say someone says that, hey, I want the, you know, weather data for the last three months in New York, um, near Central Park, like they define, you know, the block, you, and they want really granular data. Now, this data can be satisfied by a deepen network, by like some enterprise, uh, maybe or something, this can be satisfied maybe like through a synthetic data set in an LLM, and the way we really think about it is that, you know, all these suppliers should be competing to figure out which supplier, which like, in provider, can best satisfy this request, right? Eventually, that's how we kind of lead to this convergence, where you can say, like, okay, whether XM as a deepen network is really good at like satisfying this type of data requests, versus, you know, like, um, another like, you know, deepen or another like, you know, enterprise, like, or you can say like, oh, like Google Maps or Whimo is really good at identifying, you know, heat maps, right? Something like that. Um, and I think that's the world we're trying to move to. So yes, I think that's the intention, and we are very much targeting beyond web 3. Um, so the goal is just to, you know, make this like Google search-like experience for any developer in the world, and the thesis is that there's going to be more independent developers then there are going to be like, I mean, there's always going to be enterprises, but the world that we're living right now is like enterprise, you know, calls and other enterprises, like, hey, like, you know, under the deals. Um, and yeah, I think I, I agree with you, like, you know, like, not to throw anyone under the bus, but, um, there are cases where you have web 3 protocols, um, who are just buying GPUs, buying hardware, selling it again, and like claiming it is decentralized. Um, you know, it's not their fault. There's, there is no decentralized demand yet. Um, but I think if we want to build towards a future where we say, like, hey, um, let's, the, the way crypto into AI becomes useful is you actually use Intents in all these things, where like, literally, if one of you can go and say, hey, I'm looking for this data, I'm looking for this infer, I don't care about L1, which in which provider, blah, blah, blah, just give it to me, um, that's where I think, you know, like, Incentives, it's really about incentives, like a solver is incentivized to just do the discovery work, uh, set up their MCP server, make it consumable for you. And I think that's sort of like the beauty, um, that I see, pretty much you, you end up working as an arbitrage, um, between all these different providers, and, uh, in theory, the price should converge to the same price everywhere. So kind of makes sense to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, um, yeah. Yeah. I, I had a follow-up question with that, actually. So, uh, what Reppo is doing and what Epoch is doing in essentially orchestration. Epoch is doing orchestration across DeFi only, and Reppo is doing orchestration across, uh, Infrastructure right now for deepens right now. Right. So one of the major, uh, thing that we did a lot of brainstorming over there is how do we incentivize solvers to come in, uh, and how do we manage the slashing, so that whenever a solver comes in and say that I'll provide you X rate for a bridge or swap, and if it doesn't provide that rate, and the transaction has already gone through, the user has already signed a transaction, how do we slash that solver, so it's like penalized, and how does it incentives align with the whole network, right? How does that happen with Reppo right now? Like, since it's all based on physical infrastructure, uh, is it all real-time transaction that happens that I, I please a request, then you go out and find the RFQS with the multiple providers, get me the, uh, GPUs or CPUs, and then if someone is not able to provide certain amount of CPUs, uh, or quantities of GPUs, what happens over there? How do you deep analyze them? Uh, penalize them, sorry.\nYeah, that's a great question. So our approach is, uh, so two, two-part answer. One is the solver nodes are setting themsel, like, you know, are essentially, uh, setting themselves up in advance to satisfy certain types of Intents. So you know, there'll be a solver node which will say, like, hey, RG, you, you're breaking for me. I don't know if, if I don't know if it's for everyone, but, uh, yes, you've been breaking a little bit, but now it's been a little bit more, like, cutting off completely.\nOh, my bad. Um, maybe we can turn the camera off.\nOkay, I can try. Um, sorry. Can you hear us? Is it better now or, is it better now?\nYep. I guess we can continue talking for now, and then, uh, when he's back, uh, Oh, I'm, I'm, well, um, yeah. Uh, I actually, we can go to the question that I had for you. I, I have a million questions for.\nYeah. Yeah. Both of you. And, uh, I like that you say that both projects are orchestrator, because y, it makes sense. One is orchestrating infra for, uh, the pin. The other one is orchestrating, uh, liquidity, I guess, or, u, blockchain data. Yeah. uh, I say liquidity, but can be NFTs, so that's, I don't know if you consider that liquidity, so it's more, all DeFi, okay. And yeah, can you talk a bit the web three, uh, Intents?\nYeah, if you can talk a bit about the web, int,\nand the solver, mhm.\nYeah, uh, so web three Intents are pretty simple as compared to the normal AI Intents. So for example, let's say you are a staking provider, staking DAP, who's only live on a single chain. For example, let's just take an example of optimism chain, right? And then, uh, you can only serve users on your own chain, which chain you are live on, like optimism, that's it, right? And that's also, let's say you only support two or three different coins, that's it, nothing apart from stable coins or from Ethereum, these two, three coins that you can support. Now, let's say you want to, like, Karan comes on board and says that I only hold funds on polygon chain. How do I actually interact with your protocol? There's no way for him to directly interact with your protocol. He'll have to go through the native bridge or across or ever clear, something like that, to bridge his funds, then again, go to one inch or Uniswap to swap it in order to interact with your protocol. Now, there's a gap, the user experience gap, when Karan found out about your DAP on optimism chain, and he has to take four steps to actually go and put his money into your DAP. So that's the user, user experience flaw in the system. So that's where we are targeting. So you can directly indicate our APIs and have a simple button, like onboard via any chain. If clicking on that, current can directly see all the assets that he holds on all the different chains. Select chain and token from which he wants to onboard to your DAP. That's it. And then we can give you the all the call data. You just need to ask current for a single signature, which can be bundled up with your own smart contract call together. For example, the staking function call in your own tab smart contract. All things can be bundled up, and you can onboard current, uh, in a single step, in a single signature from any chain, any wallet. That goes for DAP as well, and for the wallet side, it gives more opportunity for discoverability for wallet builders. So wallet doesn't have to go out and integrate into multiple swap for multiple chains or multiple bridge options or multiple DeFi apps as well. They can just integrate our API, and then just ask our API, find me the yield providing as like best yield providing solution for XYZ tokens on any chain, and then we can give them the call data, they can give it back to users, and then they can just call it, and they have the whole user experience sorted out for the users.\nMhm. Gotcha. And, uh, what, what are you using, uh, um, as a infrastructure, uh, like, do you build your own solver? Uh, how do you, for example, let's say I ask you, I ask, um, Epoch, I want to find the best yield for stable coins. By the way, this is like a, a recent, uh, um, kind of like a one of the recent trend is like a AI for stable coins. There's so many agents for stable coins. So many, uh, investors are looking to throw money at that. So, uh, just for you, like, uh, you can put # stable coins, yeah, agents in your pitch, but let's say that I have USDT on polygon, and then I have USDC on, uh, base, and I want to find the best yield. Uh, can you talk about the tech underneath, and how you do the transaction between the crosschain, and then also questions about, does the agent has its own wallet? Are you using smart wallet, and yeah, if you can go into the details of that as much as public, uh, knowledge you can share. Yes, everything is public knowledge, I'll share. So, yeah, what happens, so user starts from an intent. So they can create this intent in much more restricted manner if they want. So let's say in your example, you only work, you only want to work with stable coins. You can specify which stable coins you want to work, and you want to find the best yield for, for example, USDT, USDC, and die, only these three. You can also specify which chain you prefer. So let's say you only want to work with three chain, like all layer twos, layer twos, like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, that's it. So you can also specify that in intent, or you can be completely open, like go out and use this three stable coin. I just want to put money in this three stable coins. I'm open to all the chains, and I'm open to all the protocols itself. So you can also restrict which protocols you want to go and do the RFQ from based on this intent. This intent goes to a server. Now,\n\n\nThe servers have this three different modules.\nOne is Hyporean, which goes out and looks for onchain, offchain condition, looks out for all the data, RFQ, any time-based condition that you also put.\nSo in the intent, you can also specify that I want to stake this only when Ethereum price goes below $2,000.\nIf Ethereum price is always above $2,000, I don't want to do this transition at all.\nSo find me the best RFQ and also execute that once the Ethereum price is below that, right?\nSo that's first module, Hyperorean.\nSecond one is orchestrator, which goes out, does all the RFQS for all the protocols that you might have selected, or if you're completely open, then all the protocols that we have already integrated.\nFor example, it will go out to all the liquid staking, lending, borrowing, yield providing, staking, all this kind of protocols on all these different chains, find the best RFQ, like which asset is giving which what RFQ and all sort of things, find the best yield providing assets from whatever chain that is out there.\nNow it will do a act tracking algorithm.\nSo starting from where your user fund sits.\nSo example, you had your starting position from USDT on polygon, and the orchestrator found out that you are getting the best yield on USDT on arbitrum chain, which is under your restricted conditions as itself, right?\nNow we'll go out and do the RFQ with multiple solvers.\nSo we have multiple solvers under the board, which is the third module, which goes out and integrate solvers, which is a completely pluggable thing.\nSo you can, every node runner can plug as many solvers, bring their own solvers.\nWe have our own solvers.\nWe work with other solvers as well, like across LiFi for swaps, one in swap and all this other cow swap protocols as well.\nPlus we have solvers for staking, restaking, lending, binging, all these tabs out there who can go out and do transactions on your behalf.\nPlus it's really easy to plug new solvers into the system.\nSo you can create your own solver, provide better rate than existing solvers, and you can get into the network.\nWe have also plugged in other networks out there like Anuma, who are also a solver marketplace, solver network.\nSo we also put this whole intent as an RFQ on the Anuma network itself to find the best route for every smaller sub intent itself.\nSo example, user had to do from USDC on polygon to XYZ chain, they need to do a bridge.\nSo bridge becomes a sub intent of this bigger intent.\nThen there can be that user might need to do a swap, then call a smart contract.\nThis can be the whole route which has three different sub intent.\nThe another route can be directly using a solver liquidity to front it on optimism chain and directly just use it, use with a smart contract.\nSo that can be another route, there can be like, and yeah, yeah, actually, and and yeah, going into the from the UX perspective, because I think the tech perspective is\nUm, yeah, so the main issue I think in the web three space right now is that users need to know a lot of these things, like, uh, uh, you need to know, like, you need to go on metamask, sign every bridge, you need to know what is like, uh, what are all the blockchains, you need to know what's the address, what is like a gas, you need to know so many different things as a base knowledge, on top of that, you need to man manually, like, click and uh, accept, sign, uh, like every change is like sign that you can move the ERC20, sign that you can do this, then swap, then put gas, then you need to swap and put gas because you don't have enough gas to do that.\nSo from the UX perspective, uh, let's say I'm the user, do I put my USDT somewhere or I keep my USDT in both polygon and arbitrum, and then uh, I sign something and then Epoch take care of like the transaction?\nSo what's what's the process and uh, I bet it's also more from the UX perspective, but then we can go down into rabbit hole of like uh, what uh, AI do you write to do all of this and what kind of like Infrastructure use.\nYep.\nSo from the user perspective, uh, user just need to hold their own normal wallet, UA wallet that they usually use.\nWe deploy a smart wallet for you.\nUh, although with the newer ERC update, it will be able to migrate EOA wallet to a smart wallet itself.\nSo with that, it would be much easier.\nThat's it.\nAnd user can hold funds in whatever coin, whatever chain that they might want.\nWe always ask uh, the starting position in the intent, where the user is starting their whole transaction from, and the end state can be open or you can define as a protocol or as a DAP or as a wallet or as an agent, you can define the end state for the users, right?\nSo user just need to sign a single transaction on, let's say, you hold your money on polygon and USDC, you just sign a transaction where uh, you wanted to put $10,000 USDC onto the like staking, you right?\nSo you just sign a transaction for 10,000 USDC on polygon chain, that's it, then uh, all the other things are handled by our solvers, that's it.\nSo all this security risk is taken by us and the solvers.\nSo solvers front all the liquidity, they'll do all this transition in the back end, they'll do all the swaps, bridges for you, they'll take, they'll get you the wrapped uh, USDC on a whatever the end position is, and then only they'll also uh, give us a like transit, they give us a hash proof that they have done all the things and they've got the wrapped USDC with them, and then only your funds are released from the smart contract, so that your funds are always secure.\nIf anything up uh, into the whole chaining of the route or the transaction route, everything, it's all uh, taken care by us or the solos, that's it.\nSo your user friends always secure and you directly get the last position, the wrapped USDT or USDC in your wallet in the same wallet.\nGotcha.\nGotcha.\nis and do they use privy or um any of the um smart wallet or Epoch?\nIt's on like a smart wallet.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, we work with every existing smart wallet out there.\nBy default, we deploy a safe wallet because we love the team and we love their tech as well.\nSo, that's why we use safe right now.\nBut it's completely uh, up to the users.\nWe can support preview, we can support by economy, we can support any other smart product as well.\nMakes sense.\nMakes sense.\nand and so uh, technically the wallet is on the chain.\nIt's not on the uh, on the agent, so the agent doesn't own the wallets.\nThe wallet is still the users owning the wallets.\nUh, it depends on what kind of signing mechanism uh, the DAP who is integrating our API is using.\nSo if it's a agent who has their own wallet, their own private key, they can use and they can deploy a safe wallet by themselves and they can use that one, the agent wallet to do all this transaction and signing can be handled by the agents.\nIf that's the user wallet, EOA wallet which is the Metamas wallet, we deploy a safe wallet for them or if they already have a safe wallet uh, with them, they can directly use that one for all the signing and everything out there.\nAnd with the uh, I guess it's ESC 7578 with which we'll be able to migrate EOA to smart wallet as well.\nUpgrade EOA to smart wallet.\nSorry.\nOkay.\nUm, okay.\nUm, I want to uh, Karan, I saw you have a question, in case if you don't, I'll keep going.\nYeah.\nNo, I was just going to ask RG, like, you know, in terms of like the architecture, in terms of how you know, Reppo works, you know, maybe you can go into it a little bit as well.\nIs it quite similar or you know, how you know, how Yeah.\nYeah.\nJust like how does it work?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSorry about the uh, thing.\nUm, so is my voice clear now?\nUh, yeah, you're good.\nOkay.\nAwesome.\nUm, yeah, so I think in in terms of how the solver network works for the data for the Reppo exchange, um, the solvers set themselves up uh, in advance to satisfy certain intents, um, and it's a different, it's a little different than, you know, like, um, transactions because we can afford to like, or like DeFi transactions because we can afford to not satisfy them, right?\nUh, where we can say like, someone says that, hey, I want this data set, um, and if that data set doesn't exist, the RF that RFD or request for data will sit there for a bit and we're not guaranteeing that the solver this request will be like kind of confirmed or will be fulfilled.\nUm, and I think that's something that's like a big differentiator, uh, because, you know, we can monetize, um, the RFD analytics itself.\nUm, so regardless of like, you know, like if a solver is picking up, um, the request for data or the request for Infrastructure, um, just that incoming flow is is like very interesting and interesting data itself.\nUm, and eventually our goal is to, you know, um, put that into an API and, you know, sell that as well as like the labs and but yeah, so the so in in terms of how the solver architecture works, um, you as a solver can set up, you you can say like, hey, I'm going to satisfy synthetic data requests on the Reppo network, and so that might mean that, you know, you basically plugged in into like all the large LLMs and now you're essentially listening for incoming RFDs, um, and that's how it would work, or you can say like, hey, I am a solver and I specialize in health data, uh, specifically like, you know, not just like providing you the data, but also computing that data into a inside a TEU, because that's how you've set up your solver, and you can basically do that computation for someone who's making a request, right?\nUm, so I think those are the kind of ways in which the solver network works, and we don't need like a lot, right?\nWe did a solver node sale just to bootstrap the initial set of solvers.\nUm, so we did, we sold about like 450 plus 456 nodes so far, and uh, and the last point I want to mention is each provider, like each provider can run their own node as well, their own solver node.\nUm, so this means that, you know, Filecoin storage weter, um, right now runs a Filecoin node, but they can also run a Reppo node where they can learn, they can listen to these independent, independent retail demand, so to say, um, you know, for the data that they're storing, and then they can also work on the Filecoin network to get more enterprise demand.\nAnd so really, I think the crux of Reppo, Reppo.exchange exchange specifically is to focus uh, on that retail demand, um, and try to scale that uh, because that's our kind of thesis.\nWe believe that demand is going to move more from enterprise to retail as we have more and more independent developers, more and more individual oneerson, million billion dollar businesses.\nUm, they won't necessarily need to like deal with enterprise.\nUm, so yeah, that's sort of like the\nVery cool.\nUm, yeah, Fen, do you want to go into uh, your next question?\nYeah, it's kind of not a consecutive from RG, but I think it's like a it embrace this AI web3 space we're now and I'd be curious to hear from you guys.\nUm, any so what's the state today of AI and web 3?\nUh, AI agents and web 3.\nuh, what's missing for AI agents to be completely autonomous and have their own wallet and being able, I guess for RG, being able to um, purchase their own um, hardware if they need to and uh, run transactions.\nSo what what's missing today to get to the stage at which um, agents will be autonomous and also do you think we'll get there?\nHow far are we from there?\nAnd could be nice to get like a a kind of a uh, like a state u\num, of what we are today and then progressively where we going and uh, what what do you think uh, is missing?\nYeah.\nUm, actually you're Yeah.\nYeah.\nSorry.\nuh, I believe one of the biggest thing that's missing that I feel uh, missing in the AI web 3 space is that how do I actually trust an agent on behalf of my funds?\nSo uh, trustable verifiable execution, or maybe just are they finding the best position for me, are they interacting with the right smart contract, because there are a few protocols that I literally don't want to interact to, because I think that they are going to go down, if I have their coins, it's going to go down, there are many of this uh, projects out there.\nSo how do we restrict the CA agents uh, who are making decision decision on my behalf of my money to not interact with those protocols, but also how do I actually trust, can I actually trust them or not?\nThat's one of the biggest fear according to me right now, uh, happy to hear other thoughts as well, uh, bra\nyeah, I was going to say the same thing, um, you know, that's the main challenge, um, and I think that's been, that's actually, you know, we've realized the biggest value add of the software that we're, I think, because you can, you can abstract this trust and reputation layer, so to say, and say that, okay, I don't need to trust the provider itself, because, you know, when you're trusting a provider, you're trusting their branding or, you know, a lot of like that bias comes in, um, and you're trusting this uh, solver uh, network, like the solver itself, where you can know that, you know, this solver, you can see their history, and our approach is actually a three-pronged approach.\nSo we have uh, as like a validator, um, like network on top of the solvers.\nSo for every once for every um, 100 solvers, there's one validator at least right now, that's how we've set it up.\nSo that's like one, um, we're also requiring providers, both data providers and Infrastructure providers to eventually stake some amount of money so they can provide some sort of guarantees of how how good they are.\nAnd then finally, um, it's about it's about the competition between solvers as well, right?\nUh, we're not guaranteeing that if you become a solver on the Reppo network, you will get requests, um, and so I think at the end of the day, it's always going to be optimistic, um, you know, instead of like, you know, deterministic, uh, that's how I see it, uh, but yeah, I think we need better and more approaches to abstract, um, reputation and trust to another layer, uh, and unfortunately or fortunately, that's how things have been done, you know, in the world, we have progressed so far, right?\nUh, we always abstract away this like layer of trust and reputation, and the last point I want to mention is I think there's this belief in crypto into AI that if you make things verifiable, like, you know, you don't need trust, and I've said this like many times, I think those, that's kind of like, um, what's the word, it's it's like a little contr, like it seems right, but it's actually not right, because sure, it's verifiable, but I, I don't really care if I can verify that someone cheated me.\nI'm like, &quot;Okay, cool.\nI now know that I got cheated, but like, you know, it would have been nice that I, you know, um, you know, and then because I think then, you know, you go into like, okay, like what are the consequences?&quot;\nAnd\n\n\nReally, I think in the real world, it comes down to, well, if someone cheated me, I can sue them, they'll go to jail, and there's some repercussions. And I think in web3, we don't have that. So, either there already needs to exist like a really strong insurance mechanism or a way for me to reimburse. Otherwise, I think verifiability is just like, yeah, for you know, I was at the Nexus Labs office last week, um, and I said it to them. I'm like, hey, like verifiability is a nice thing, but it's only useful when there are consequences with it, right? So, I think that's how I think about it. Trust and verification are two different concepts. And I think we have this tendency in web3 to like mix and jumble them to say that, oh, like if everything is zk, everything is verifiable, we're good, we're Gucci. I'm like, no, no, no, there's way more of that. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense.\n\nAnd uh, and the MCP world also, uh, it's kind of like having some problem in that as well where we don't have registries yet. And it's so funny, 'cause all these problems seem like the replica of the same problems where it's like the moment you start decentralizing, you start getting, uh, uh, yeah, scam, bad actors, you start getting, uh, uh, who do I trust, what do I use, and then we start narrowing down again using the Apple store, using, uh, uh, like marketplaces like Amazon. It kind of like centralizes eventually again. And so I guess our goal in web3 will be how do we truly decentralize in a way that is like not getting back into like few players that become the gatekeeper.\n\nAnd I wonder in, um, I really like what you mentioned about the verifiability makes sense for provenance, for ID, and knowing who you're talking to. But then we do need some reputation system, I think, as well, and some, um, maybe a middle layer, uh, that can like, uh, uh, like provide some kind of safety, either lashing insurance or something where you have your transaction, they happen autonomously, uh, you're familiar, you know what's your risk, and you know that if something goes bad, uh, you pay these like middle layer, maybe 5%, but you have the guarantee that if something goes wrong, your transaction is not executed, or you know that you have some risk and you take the risk.\n\nYeah, I think that's what it is, right? I think the TLDR is we need something, we need an equivalent of, um, protocol for agents, like that's what it is. The only reason Poly Market works to the extent that it works is because I think people underestimate that the usefulness of UMA protocol, um, you know, like Poly Market can like work to the scale it works if you didn't have a, I mean, you know, to have a resolution mechanism, right? Because like big sticks are involved. I can come after, you know, someone and like trying, like there's big stakes to game the system as well. That's kind of what I'm trying to say. So I think, um, I don't know exactly like what the version of UMA protocol for agents will look like, but I think it requires like you, some sort of complex, like reputation doesn't just do it, right? Reputation gives you like, okay, like it gives you more information, just like Google reviews tells you like this restaurant's better, but you know, again, as if we're talking about a lot of money, right? Sure, buying a bad pizza for five bucks, not the end of the world, uh, having a bad, bad 100k bet because an agent kind of like, you know, messed it up, I think that's like different, right? So I think we just need to like, from first principles, yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd it's like, uh, actually, it's so funny, in Poly Market, there was like a dispute, if you remember when the Venezuela election got Maduro to win, but uh, Poly Market said that someone else won, and uh, yeah, the kind of dispute is like few millions of dollars, like how do you even do that when you're, uh, have like a large scale? And then with agents, I believe that's a big misconception or big things that we're missing. We think about, uh, Epoch right now in the human, uh, uh, time, like mindset time, where, uh, proposals are two weeks, uh, voting on Poly Market is whenever the voting ends. So everything that happen, uh, in, um, or or election, election happens every four years. But in a world where AI runs everything, we're going to transition from like two weeks to like a streaming or to like every 10 minutes or whatever the SLA will be for, uh, that. And so yeah, I think there will be a need of like a incentive mechanism that regulate and find some kind of like a, um, yeah, like an equilibrium that, uh, it works through incentives and not through someone clicking and say, okay, let's resolve this, 'cause yeah, you can have like a resolution, but they have to be really fast. So I think we're going to end up in some kind of like a, uh, I really like where you went with the, um, protocol, something on the line, and it would be interesting to see what that will look like. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd I think just one thing. Oh, go ahead.\n\nYeah. I would like to add two cents to what Raghav said and also a small question for Raa as well when you said about the verifiability. Uh, let's say, uh, if we can verify, it does affect the reputation of agents or solvers or anyone if they have provided bad responses, a bad deal, a bad bit for anyone out there, right? So reputation is on the line. What if you just introduce a penalization mechanism on top of the reputation? So let's say, uh, it's like a fraud proof mechanism, fraud submitting mechanism like the chain use, right? Where a bridge happened, but it wasn't supposed to happen, but then you get penalized later on after seven days, there was there's a seven-day window where anyone can go out and prove that this whole transaction was wrong. So similar that this whole, uh, solver result was wrong. Anyone can go out and prove and based on that, the repetition gets slashed on chain. Uh, first thing is, would a solver want to affect the repetition and it had to be affected like changed by a huge manner depending on the value of the transaction that was fraudulent? Second thing is penalization where all the incentives are blocked or maybe a huge penalization is done on the staking that they already done on your network on or on Epoch Protocol network or any other network out there, which is through which they provided the bad fraudulent solutions, because, uh, the reason why I'm coming from this is because we were also thinking about the competition and the incentivization and the penalization mechanism for solvers who are going to go live on Epoch Protocol network, that how do we prevent this, because similar to your use case, like where Infrastructure is required, 100k, 200k will be a smaller bet for the Infrastructure there, similarly for DeFi, millions of dollars of transaction happening through solvers is a normal in this really small thing, uh, how people have done it. I've just thought of that thing, and that's why I'm proposing these two things, like what if you use those two things in addition, then what are your thoughts on that part?\n\nYeah, that's a great question. So I think, you know, the the main challenge that I've seen, again, uh, you know, guided by my time at Filecoin, is, um, it's a, like knowing what is bad, what is bad or what is like good is a little more murky, like when you think about what is good data, bad data, what is bad infra, good infra, uh, a lot of it just boils down to, like, you know, like the consumer, right? Uh, I mean, it like, you know, this could be a good data set or a good infra for my use case, but not for you, versus I feel like in the case of like, you know, and you can correct me here, but in the case of like DeFi finance, like you identify like what is fraud, um, and so I think that becomes a little like challenging. Um, so yeah, really, I think that's uh, why our approach has been that, um, what what what uh, you know, Fed was just saying, the beauty of this real-time, you know, um, the real-time interaction is that you can have kind of this competition though, right? I think when we try to make regulations or processes, uh, in the human kind of centric world in the real world. Um, of course, time and you know, time is one, um, aspect, but also it there's this like belief that, you know, you cannot have competition because there needs to be some regulatory authority body, and I think if you really go a little philosophical in meta, what's really changing is how competition-based regulatory frameworks come into place. Um, I, I can't remember where I read about this, but I think there was some, some research about this at Harvard Law where they were talking about, you know, like, how do you think of like policy and like regulation from first principles when you don't have like this relation, this like enforcer, enforce relationship, uh, and it's really about like just economic incentives, like everyone is an economic agent, so it's really like game theory playing at its best, um, in real time, and it was just a fascinating piece. Um, I'll, I'll share it, uh, once I find it after. But I think so to come back to your question, I think that's what it comes down to is like, how do you create, um, you know, this intense competition between solvers to always do the right thing, and in our case, for example, the right thing would be, um, if someone asked for a certain data set, they provided that data set, um, and that's the only thing a validator can validate, um, that they did not, you know, try to like, you know, um, look into the data set or like, you know, try to unpack it, like those are things, sure, that can. That's like, you know, clear fraud. But again, at the end of the day, there's always a chance that the person who requested the data was like, \"Hey, this wasn't good enough.\" And, you know, that's fine, you know, because at the end of the day, you can't take that against the solver. The solver is like, \"Hey, well, the data provider didn't have great data.\" And so, it really like, you know, like technically, it should harm the reputation of the data provider. Um, but I think our approach is still very much like it should, you know, so the weight that we will give to quality of data, which will basically come as a feedback loop from the user, will, uh, be like less, like maybe like 20% weight, uh, and then most of the reputation will be based on the like the objective behavior that we can measure, which is, you know, like, is the solver, like, what is their uptime, what is the response time, um, are they actively listening to requests, um, are they unpacking the data and like, you know, like doing something fraudulent and trying to like, you know, uh, do something under the table? So I think that's yeah, that's kind of like a long, long answer to say that, um, I think, uh, it it's not one thing, it's like reputation plus staking plus some sort of like, you know, uh, restaking abs, uh, it's just not not clear right now what it would be, but I think, uh, there's no silver bullet. I think that's the answer.\n\nI would say you already got me in the when you defined that T5 gives you statistical statistical data, have to do with numbers. So you can define what is wrong and what is not. But for agents and interpretations, translation or data kind of perspective, in your case, it's much more like depends on human to human. So yeah, I get it why it doesn't work. The penalization and repetition doesn't work.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But I think it's like a very big opportunity, uh, that, you know, uh, we, we can tap into. Yeah. Yeah. And it's it's some problem that the credit card company already are solving now, like, uh, when you get a dispute, who's right, who's wrong, and, uh, at the end of the day, it's like, if it's a small transaction, they usually just, uh, give you the money back because it costs less and do the research. If it's like a larger one, then you need to put lawyers and other things like that. And, um, and then so that's in the real world, the human-to-human interaction. So human pain somewhere, and then there's the decentralized world that solves the problem of like, um, trust to completely remove trust with proof of work, and so we just like, uh, create the incentive, this like, um, shelling point that is like, you are better off playing the rules of the game than playing against, because if you play against, you're just wasting money because everyone plays by the rule, and so the, the network is is basically, uh, follows the chain that has the highest proof of work. And because of that, if you try to do a double, um, like to fork, you need to have more money than whoever is running, uh, um, the right, uh, the right chain. And so the incentive is such as, yeah, you can cheat and you can, um, you can basically roll back one transaction, but you better roll back a transaction that has to be way more, uh, the value of that transaction has to be way, way higher than the cost you have to run the 51% attack, and good luck with that. So that the the system is made in a way that it's very stable, and and even if it goes out of stability, uh, there's like a consensus mechanism where people can still get involved and force the system to go back to, uh, the regular one. Uh, sometime in 2017, if you remember when there was the block, the large, the the large block classic, Ethereum classic and the main Ethereum, I don't, yes, the DAO, the DAO, that was a little bit more wild because the DAO, uh, hack and the classic, uh, an Ethereum fork that actually was more like kind of like gave us a sense of like, okay, Ethereum is still super centralized because they just decided and they need it, and there was not like a, it wasn't a mechanism that just like Bitcoin, you need to get all the not to agree, and they do that with the mechanism that was like a literally, okay, let's fork it and we follow this one, and everyone was like, okay, let's do it. Um, and I'm actually happy that Ethereum kind of like a now is showing that, uh, they seem to signal that we will never do that again. But again, in Bitcoin, that part is like embedded in the system. Uh, proof of work, it's it pretty much guarantee that because, uh, I mean, good luck going back 20, 30 blocks with the current, uh, um, difficulty levels and the amount of money you have to spend to roll back all those block is like insane. In Ethereum is cheaper. Yeah. So it's that's like a trust me, bro, kind of thing to some degree. Um, and I, so where I'm going with that, I think that the AI, I agree with you, Argie and Akshit, I think that, uh, where we going with AI agents is someplace where has to be a mix of completely, uh, autonomous systems that use some incentive mechanism based on finance, possibly, uh, DeFi, energy, or yeah, we'll see what it is. And Sam Altman just wrote this, uh, blog post called the graceful, uh, the graceful intelligence or the graceful, graceful, damn it, they wrote that, he wrote that yesterday. I'll find the name in a second, but he mentioned that eventually the cost of inference will go down to the cost will converge to the cost of electricity, and almost to me that starts sounding like proof of work again, where, uh, the cost of proof of work goes to the cost of electricity, and so the stability of the network becomes like a whatever ever in the world you run the\n\n\nNodes, and so I think we might start seeing some arbitrage again in the AI world, where we go converging to the electricity.\n\nUh, yeah, I think that's kind of like where we're going, but I'd be curious also.\n\nUh, yeah, this is like kind of a rant, so I'd be curious also to hear from you guys, what do you think about AGI, where you think web3 plays in this?\n\nUm, and uh, yeah.\nDo you see a world in AI becoming decentralized?\nWhat concerns you?\nKind of an open question on like where we going and what we can do from the web3 space, and I'm happy to also narrow down the question if helps.\nBut yeah, let's see where we go with that.\n\nYeah, I can, I can go.\nI think, I think, um, yeah, I think as things stand today, I think, uh, like, you know, claiming that, you know, web3 crypto into AI will lead AGI is definitely just like a lot of BS.\nUm, I think, uh, yeah, I just like, you know, selling like moonshine to a lot of like people, um, partly because, you know, we don't even know what that even means.\nUh, like, you know, like it's like, okay, like if someone had defined like this is like there was like a like total alignment on like what AGI meant and then we can achieve that.\nUm, I, I really think, um, see, like I think crypto into AI is really good at, uh, sorry, and I interrupt you here for a second, actually, great point.\nWhat is AGI for you guys?\nWhat's the definition?\n\nUm, for me, it's, uh, for me, I think it's very like, you know, personal, right?\nIt's like when a, when AI can start to do like day-to-day tasks that I do, um, then I think I'll, I'll consider it to be here, which include, um, you know, like walking my dog, um, you know, um, it, uh, mediating conflicts with, um, my partner, my parents, like those kind of things, uh, and like understanding emotions in real time, like I think when it's there and like, like, wow, like it just did it for me.\nI assigned it to like, you know, like get someone, wait, you could trust it, you could trust it to be your mediator with your relationships.\nI like that idea.\nThe day you can do that, the day you can trust an AI to do that, I think AGI is here.\nUm, right, because it's like, you know, you're it, like requires so much context real time.\nYeah.\nLike that's what it is, right?\nI think that's for me, like really like the measure of AGI.\nUm, it's not, you know, some, that's good.\nI like that.\nYeah, that's the final pinnacle of an example.\nLike go and solve my fight with my wife.\nI think that's the most, how long it takes.\nUm, yeah, that's the most human thing.\nYeah.\nOut of everything else that you mentioned, like walking the dog or cooking the food and yeah.\n\nYeah.\nI think those are things you need to do.\nUh, but yeah, I think that's what AGI really means to me.\nAnd I think it, you know, crypto into AI really comes back to Incentives.\nI think we, I think one thing I didn't talk about so far is like the capital coordination layer that we're building, which is a pretty significant part.\nI think data and infra are they're quite big from the Intents part.\nWe're building this thing which we're call right now, it's called Reppo.\non and eventually just be called, we'll be making an app called just Reppo, and it's a way for vibe coders to essentially publish their work in real time, almost in like a video format, 30-second pitches, and people can just vote for it, and when they vote, they're essentially investing in their AI apps and V-coded projects, uh, and we're like, we've come up with this really interesting B tokconomics adaptation, um, and I think that's for me, like really capturing what AI into crypto can do.\nI think we need to acknowledge that, you know, what crypto empowers us is to give us this, um, you know, like power of like, you know, real-time Incentives, uh, which also boils down to like real-time information and real-time clarity, right?\nLike you essentially have these like real-time feedback loops, which you don't in like traditional markets, and I think the reason why DeFi took off the way it did is because partly, of course, you know, like all the nice decentralized, you know, like permissionless stuff, but really, I think it comes down to like, you know, things are so like information flows at the speed of light and with the feedback loops are so quick, and I think really, I think that's what's going to get us to, um, like if crypto and AI would were to be successful, I think it would be about, um, feedback loops, that's one place we can win, uh, compared to like, you know, like centralized AI, um, so like, you know, like just to give you an example, like what you were talking about, if today someone builds an AI agent network, and all this AI agent network does is a watchtower our network.\nSo like, let's call them watch.agents agents or something, and every time any agent interacts, like agent to agent interaction, it has to pay like, you know, like a 1% fee or probably 0.1% like whatever the fee is for that network to like, you know, be a watch, right?\nA security, um, I think that's that makes a ton of sense, like someone should build it, uh, sort of some sense, you know, we're trying to do that with a solver network and Reppo, but, uh, not in the same manner.\nI think that's and that is uniquely enabled by crypto, you're incentivizing a bunch of random people in the world to do something for money, you know?\nI think that's what crypto does.\nAnd I think we just need to find more and more problems like that within the world of AI.\nAnd there's tons that crypto can solve instead of like trying to like directly compete with, you know, chat GPT as like, you know, their, uh, chat kind of like software.\nWe can do that.\nI think we can try to do that.\nBut really, I think from my experience working in this space for about two years, I don't think giving someone tokens to interact with your product is a sustainable strategy.\nUm, I think it'll be, it'll be there past DGE, like yeah, you know, there'll be something else to farm.\nSo, yeah, I like that a lot.\nAre there any final thoughts you have Akshit, uh, to close us out?\n\nYeah.\nUh, I totally agree with Raghav, like he explained everything in so depth and so good manner, uh, and also all the example that he gave, uh, I really go and vibe with that.\nI would just like to add that maybe, uh, for the AGI, I would also like something who can go out and get some, uh, get me a girlfriend really fast.\nThat's also right now it takes a lot of time, uh, to go out and chat and do the texting and all this sort of things, it also takes a lot of time, so yeah, maybe VJ can also, Raa can also count that thing in his EJ example next.\n\nOkay.\nUh, I believe that's already a cheater, something like that, some, some AI which is using which you can use to explain things or something like that.\nSo yeah, I believe that things are reaching at quite some stage because, uh, even right now, I've seen a lot of videos coming out on Tik Tok and Instagram where you cannot differentiate whether it's AI video, AI generated video or an actual video.\nThere just small things here and there that you have to look out for, and if that's also gone, then you won't be able to recognize if the influencer or the video that you're watching is actual AI or is an actual person.\nSo yeah, we are going moving forward to that direction really fast enough, faster than we really thought.\nSo yeah, uh, and for crypto and AI, I believe Raa gave the best example that it enables people to incentivize people to do things, uh, with tokens, and that's really beautiful example.\nThanks Raghav for that one.\n\nYeah, that was really good.\nThis is an amazing conversation, guys.\nI think this is a really good look into like where crypto and AI can actually, you know, address things that, you know, maybe people aren't working on or outside of the scope of what normally people think about when they think about AI.\nAnd so, uh, yeah, I just want to thank you guys one more time for coming on.\nThis was a really interesting conversation.\nUh, I personally got to learn a lot.\nSo I, I appreciate that.\nUm, where can the audience go to find you guys, find what you are working on?\n\nUh, Twitter is the best place to over there.\nSo you should find me.\n\nYeah, same for us.\nUh, uh, Reppo network on Twitter on X and uh, reppo.xyz.\nWe're launching some stuff soon.\nSo yeah, look out for it.\n\nI'll do also a plug in here since, uh, we're already in the vibe.\nUh, we just launched, uh, the Apcoin agent.\nWe just officially launched Floy.\nSo go check it out is play.xyz.\n\nAnd, uh, yeah, uh, and by the way, I'm sure that Akshit and RG, uh, we should talk after this also for potential partnerships, cuz we definitely need both web3 Intents and, uh, uh, as well as, uh, the pin, uh, like a, uh, underneath our model.\nSo yeah, I think we can continue the conversation afterwards.\n\nSure.\nSure.\nYeah.\nWould love to.\nYeah.\nKaran, where can we find you since, uh, uh, I'm also on X?\n\nUh, I'm not not too active, just more, more just locked in right now.\nBut, uh, yeah, find me on X.\nWe'll put all the links in the, uh, in the description.\n\nThank you guys once again.\nThis was episode number three of the agent state.\nWe'll be back soon.\n\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n",
