  "cleanText": "For over a century, taxi cabs have been a steadfast mode of transportation in New York City, unless you wanted to leave Manhattan. Cabs and their drivers are an integral part of making this city work for its people. But did you know that cab drivers are also people? And right now, they're facing a crisis that could threaten the entire system. Meet Fernando Matteo, founder of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, who says cab drivers are facing severe discrimination. Most people that work in buildings or in offices have access to a Poop room except for a cab dog. His office is his car. He can't poop in his car. Okay. I mean, it works for the train, but fair enough. So, why specifically are you concerned about taxi drivers being able to poop when everybody poops? I read that in a book. Well, a couple days ago. Well, remember there are 200,000 cab drivers in New York City.\nThat's a lot of ass.\nIt's a lot of ass. A lot of prostate. A lot of everything. And New York City has no parking spots where drivers can park and go to a bathroom. They have to double park. And the city will issue you a ticket. It's unbelievable. To take a pee cost you $115.\nThat's your entire day's pay. $115 for a pee. How much would a poop cost? My 401k.\nSorry, one second. I I can do better. Is this bathroom issue really that much of a problem? Don't we all just poop every third Friday of the month? I put four of New York City's top waste producing cab drivers on the clock to find out. Why is going to the bathroom such an issue for taxi drivers?\nI mean, is that why Robert Dairo is so angry in the movie? We don't have designated places where we could park and be able to relieve oursel.\nIt gets to the point that you cannot hold it.\nAnd why can't you hold it? Is it because you're drinking all those free water bottles full of yellow Gatorade on the street all the time?\nIt's not Gatorade.\nThat's driver's piss.\nUrine on my car. I had tinted windows in the back.\nYeah.\nSo I always have an extra cup, you know. So I park, go to the back seat and kneel, you know, and just do my thing. But surely these drivers couldn't boo in bottles. Right. Right. So where do they actually access a Poop room?\nDefinitely the public parks.\nI us use mostly fast food places.\nI go to the emergency hospitals.\nWait, so you go to urgent care?\nYes, that's right.\nSo would you classify your dumps as a medical event?\nOf course. For number two, there's a place that they know me for years, decades there, it's the UN Plaza Hotel. But for number one, anywhere I just create.\nYou're basically telling me you're an artist.\nYes.\nPerhaps the only way to fully understand the scope of the matter was to experience it firsthand. So, I decided to join this artist in the studio. And in solidarity, I haven't peed all day.\nSo, uh, you got to go yet?\nNot yet.\nMe neither. No. That'd be crazy if I had to go immediately.\nLet me ask you something. You ever racially profiling any passengers?\nNot anymore because I don't carry cash.\nAll right. Yeah. What an honest answer. Okay. Let's say you taking somebody to the Empire State Building. That's your fair, right? But you had a seven layer dip for lunch. Where's the best place to poop between here and there?\n44th Street.\nThat's the UN Plaza Hotel.\nOh, okay. You you really have centered a lot of this lifestyle around the UN Plaza Hotel?\nOh, yes.\nSo, on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad you got to go?\nUh, right now I'm uh three.\nIt became clear that this issue was deathly serious and I needed to take drastic steps to address it.\nTry to avoid potholes.\nWatch the turn. Watch the turn.\nMan all the way to keep chugging. Not having access to a bathroom for a full 27 minutes really highlighted the severity of the problem. Luckily, Fernando has a solution. His big idea, placards. We could give the drivers placards that allow them to park without getting a ticket for a 10-minute pee or poop break. 10 minutes. Do you think 10 minutes is enough? I mean, what if you got like a squeezer? Like you trying to throttle it out, but the demon trying to cling on. You know what I mean? Or it's a dangler. You ever had one of them once where you ready to stand up and then you look down, you got a tail?\nNo.\nDrivers are focused on making money. If they're not on the road, they're not making money.\nBathroom placards for cab drivers are a pretty good solution. So, I decided to make Fernando a subtle, tasteful prototype. All right. Look at that blatau. Look at that. And you can see right here, we got the boom boom boom.\nSo, they know you mean business.\nThat's a That's a nice design. I like it.\nLook at him. My man looking relaxed.\nHe's not getting a ticket today.\nProblem solved. Sure, these aren't exactly street legal, but anything to give our cabbie friends some relief.\nOh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, he's just pooping. Hey, he's just pooping.\n[Music]\n",
