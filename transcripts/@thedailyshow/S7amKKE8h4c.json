  "cleanText": "We all know President Trump has spent the last two weeks in a wrestling match with the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein, but he's been fighting the last six months with a much more alive person, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. And boy does Trump hate the guy.\nJerome Powell has done a terrible job. And frankly, I don't think he could do a worse job.\nWe have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed.\nHe's an average mentally person. I'd say low in terms of what he does. Low uh low IQ for what he does. Okay.\nBut this, you know numb skull. He's a numb skull.\nI think he's a total stiff. You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a nothings. It's like talking to a chair. No personality.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know whatever happened to all of our exciting, dynamic Federal Reserve chairs?\nWho doesn't remember Fed Chairman Dirks McGinty? Huh?\nDid he crash the economy? Yes, that guy was radical.\nNow, you may be wondering what Jerome Powell ever did to make Trump so angry. I mean, the way Trump talks about him, you you'd think they caught him at a Coldplay concert with Trump's wife.\nBut at its heart, this is a beef about economics. Trump wants to lower interest rates to help juice the economy. But Jerome Powell is in charge of setting those interest rates. And he refuses to lower them because he's worried that will increase inflation. And and nothing nothing makes Trump angrier than someone doing their job well. He should have cut interest rates a long time ago. Europe has cut him 10 times in the short period of time and we cut him none. And the only time he cut him was just before the election to try and help Kamla or Biden, whoever the hell it was, because nobody really knew. How did that work out?\nYou'll tell me. It didn't work out too well, did it?\nBy the way, if you're wondering what this guy has to do with any of this, I'll tell you nothing.\nThat's the crown prince of Bahrain. He flew across the planet to talk about peace in the Middle East and now he just has to sit there while Trump works himself up over some personal\nIt's like when you were at your friend's house for dinner and get dragged into their parents' fight, you know. Oh. Oh, you know what? Let's ask Timmy. Timmy, is four beers a normal amount to drink at breakfast? Tell him. Tell Mr. Patterson. Tell Mr. Patterson.\nBut yeah, sorry, your highness. Doesn't matter what you were here for. Just buckle up and enjoy the ride.\nHe's a terrible He's a terrible Fed chief. I was surprised he was appointed. I was surprised, frankly, that uh Biden put him in.\nYeah. Yeah. Why did Joe Biden put Jerome Powell in? Let's go back to when Joe Biden appointed Jerome Powell and see what Joe Biden said about him. It is my pleasure and my honor to announce my nomination of Jerome Powell to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. He's strong. He's committed. He's smart.\nDamn, man. Joe Biden looks fat as\nHey, I get it. I'm also trying desperately to forget everything that happened during Trump's first term. So now you might be wondering if Trump hates this guy so much, why doesn't he just fire him? Well, he's been threatening to pretty much non-stop ever since he won the election. But you tell me if Powell seems phased by it.\nSome of the president's elected adviserss have suggested that you should resign. Um, if he asked you to leave, would you go?\nNo.\nUh, can you follow up on is do you think that legally you're not required to leave?\nNo.\nOkay, you don't want to spin it. Do a little grandstanding. You know, the camera's on. Give it a little razledazzle, Big J. Come on. But no, no. Jerome Powell truly does not give a about Trump's threats.\nTo follow up on Victoria's question, um, do you believe the president has the power to fire or demote you?\nNot permitted under the law.\nNot what?\nNot permitted under the law.\nWow.\nHe actually he went on to add, \"Try me, bitch.\"\nAlthough, you know, just one more quick follow-up. Chairman Powell, do you think I can pull off jean shorts?\nNot permitted under\nharsh, but fair. But Powell is right. The president can't actually fire him. The position of Fed chairman was designed to be independent from the president to ensure that his decisions will be made free of political pressure.\nBut Trump thinks he found a loophole. Yesterday, the president suggested a caveat that he could remove Chairman Powell if there is cause. He has accused Powell of fraud related to the Fed's multi-year 2 billion renovation project.\nHe's spending $2.5 billion dollars to to I guess it's a renovation. I don't know. The one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in.\nAnd now on top of it, he's building a close to $3 billion little nest egg for himself. He's doing a little renovation for 2.5 billion of the Fed.\n[Applause]\nYes, I' I've been here this entire time.\n[Applause]\nBy the way, it's crazy to hear Trump complain about the Federal Reserve palace while he's sitting in his gold bedazzled office. And that Jerome Powell sure is extravagant. Don't you agree?\nGoldplated eagle holding up a marble end table.\nBut on the other hand, Trump's smear campaign is having an effect. Some of these charges of extravagant spending got to the point where Powell had to deny them under oath. The media reports that you actually accurately quoted, they're misleading and and inaccurate in in many, many respects. There's no new marble. There no special elevators. There are no new water features. There's no beehives. What?\nNo beehives. Not even one. Well, now I'm worried Jerome Powell isn't spending enough on the renovations. How can I trust a Fed chairman who isn't licking honey off his fist like Winnie the Pooh?\nIt seems like they're now trying to make the renovation sound as shitty as possible. No water feature, no special elevators, and worst of all, they're dismantling the skate park for Dirks McGinty.\nFor more on the future of Chairman Jerome Powell, let's go live to the Federal Reserve with Desi Lydic.\nYou know that that is a big renovation. Uh Desi, what would the ramifications be for Trump trying to fire Powell?\nGreat question, Jordan. Firing Pal would destabilize the US economy. And the markets would be absolutely shaken. And there's only one way, and I mean one way, to protect your finances if that happens. Before the market crashes, you got to take all the money out of your savings account.\nIt doesn't It's It's hard It's hard to hear you. It's hard to hear you over the renovation noise.\nNo, Jordan. It's the renovation noise. I I know it's the renovation noise. I I can't hear you. Can you tell Can you tell them to stop? People need to hear this.\nHey, hey, hey, hey, guys. Can you just do something else for a bit?\nGreat.\nThank you.\nAwesome. Great. Great. Okay. Okay.\nPerfect. You you were you were about to say what Americans need to do.\nYes. I cannot stress this enough how vital it is for people to take action before it's too late by moving all of their money from any dollar holdings because the bond market get what is that?\nUh treasury bond shorted. The government sells them.\nThe zone. What is a zone?\nOh, it's a circular saw. A circular They have to cut through them.\nI can't hear you. What? You have to speak up. You have to speak up.\nYou wouldn't understand cuz you're not a real man.\n[Applause]\nSorry. I'm I'm sorry that was embarrassing. I I meant to say that you wouldn't understand the tools that they're using here because you're not a real man.\nOh, I I got you. Thank you. Uh can can you go back to the the very important thing we have to understand?\nOh, yes. Yes. Actually, maybe a a visual aid will help. This is very very important. So, please memorize this chart. Okay, this is the key to the whole thing here. Wait, no. What do you Wait, what are you doing? No, that's not trash, guys. God damn it, Zi. Look, the noises. Stop. Just tell us. Tell us.\nOkay. Okay. So, here it is. The bond market. It's the one place.\nDamn it.\nGod, guys, take a break. Take a break.\nGreat. They're going to take a break.\nUm, as I was saying, monetarily speaking, the bond market is not reacting.\nGreat cut.\nI don't think this is working. You know, maybe we'll just check back in in a few minutes or you know what? It's a break. The the noise. Go.\nOkay. Okay. Okay. Let me make this really\nWhat? What is going on now?\nWait, that's that's not coming from here. Is that a shitty old car alarm?\nOh my god. That's my Mitsubishi Eclipse. I I illegally parked in a handicap spot. I think I'm joined by my car. Sorry, I got to go. Desi light. Everyone, come on.\n[Music]\n",
