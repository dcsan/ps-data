  "cleanText": "[Music]\nWe had a tremendous show planned for you. Well-designed, articulate, a tremendous deconstruction of the most interesting issues of the day. We prepared a whole piece on the new Trump tariffs, breaking down the different rates and their secondary impacts, a truly illuminating dive into the overlooked role of the commodities markets in trade deficit accounting. It was going to be so funny. But sadly, at the last minute, we had to scrap all that because Elmo\n[Applause]\nlost his [ __ ] mind. Elmo is back to his usual family-friendly content after a hacker posted racist and anti-Semitic remarks to the Sesame Street character's X account.\n[Applause]\nThis is what happens when you go too long without tickling Elmo.\n[Applause]\nI'm sure it wasn't terrible. It was Elmo. How bad could it be? The since deleted posts called for death to the Jewish community and criticism of President Trump. The hacker also demanded the release of the Epstein files and used inappropriate language to respond to other users.\n[Applause]\nAll caps, Elmo. By the way, to the news people, is that the only B-roll of Elmo you have to play for the Death to Jews story? Look at Elmo in the B- roll. He's dancing. Hey everybody, Trump's a child. Woo! For God's sakes. You don't have any footage you could use of Elmo being appropriately sad or circumspect when talking about those post? It's Elmo. Every week he's in a spiritual crisis. Here he is. Look, we found this. This is him finding out that leaves fall off of trees. Oh, Elmo just found out about life's impermanence.\n[Applause]\nCouldn't you have used that for his death to choose stuff? Instead, he's out there death to Jews. Anyway, these tweets were especially shocking to me as someone who has worked with Elmo. I've worked with Elmo as everybody definitely remembers. Yeah. I hosted Elmo Palooa in I'm going to say 1831. This picture makes me sad for a number of reasons. It does remind me though of a certain point in one's career where you haven't really established yourself yet and so they really don't give a [ __ ] if your wardrobe fits. You're just kind of a guy that's there with a suit that's there. And if it fits, great. And if it needs to also fit Big Bird for the next sketch, take it off, Stewart. Snuffle up against is up next. I mean, Jesus, did I take a dump in my pants? Look at this. You know when the camera people are laughing at that's not fair that Richie that's not fair. The truth is I'm being honest Elmo at the time was great to work with. It was Was there a ton of coke on set? Of course. But hateful racist Elmo is not the Elmo that I remember. I know what's in Elmo's heart. And so I thought it would be appropriate to have my old friend back so that we could talk through this very difficult time. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my old friend, Elmo. Elmo.\n[Applause]\nHi everybody.\n[Applause]\nWho's ready to learn about rainbows? Y\n[Applause]\nElmo, you know what we're here to talk about.\n[Applause]\nThe the Jews. That's right. We're talking about the Jews. Elmo, I think you had something that you wanted to say. Yes. Elmo was hacked. They hacked Elmo. They guessed Elmo's password was Elmo. Elmo 1, two, three. Elmo knows passwords should have more numbers, but Elmo only knows three numbers.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nElmo, what did we talk about about taking responsibility? It's true. Elmo wasn't hacked. It it was Elmo, but Elmo was radicalized by the manosphere. Elmo is part of the male loneliness epidemic.\n[Applause]\nYou you you see what happened was Elmo was doing his own research on flu shots.\n[Applause]\n6 hours later because of the algorithm, Elmo was moderating the QAnon Discord chat\n[Applause]\nand building homemade bombs. Elmo You need to take responsibility. Don't blame the algorithm. A lot of kids count on you for life lessons. And Elmo, accountability is a big part of that. Are you cancelling, Elmo? Once again, the so-called tolerant left policing speech that's inconvenient to their woke dogma. Who's Who's the real puppet now, Jon? Who's the real puppet? Who's the real puppet now? You You You're the real puppet. What? Elmo. That just sounds like alt-right talking point word salad. Yeah. You said it, not Elmo. Elmo's alt right. No reason to cancel Elmo's funding then. Oh my god. Is that what this is about? Elmo, you're pandering to the right so you can keep your government funding for public broadcasting. Elmo can't go back on the streets. John, you you have no idea what it's like. Elmo's too pretty to live under a bridge. John, it's a life brought to you by the letter sucking. Okay, Elmo won't. Elmo won't go back. Elmo can't go back. No.\n[Applause]\n[Applause]\nWell, I I I guess I'm glad you don't I guess actually believe all that stuff you said about Jews. Of course not, John. Elmo doesn't believe almost any of it.\n[Applause]\nAl although I mean it is kind of weird they all stayed home on 911. Don't Elmo they didn't stay home. That is a myth, Elmo. Oh, okay. Elmo, sorry. Please don't let them cut Elmo's funding. You'll talk to them, won't you, Lit?\n[Applause]\nAll right. Okay. Elmo, everybody. Elmo.\n[Applause]\nWow, that was that was that was enlightening. I didn't I didn't expect any of that. Elmo shoots from the hip. You can't control him. I'll admit the second thing threw me off, too. That I thought that was weird. I thought that was weird. Now, uh uh the impetus for Elmo's rant seems to be the Department of Justice memo that has just been released that said the Epstein sex trafficking case was officially closed and that no new information would be forthcoming. And while Elmo is demanding that the files be released, Donald Trump's response is brought to you by the letters FU. You still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy's been talked about for years. Are people still talking about this guy? This creep. That is unbelievable. Unbelievable. You guys ran on it. Remember this. We need to release the Epstein list. That That is an important thing. This Epstein sex ring operation. I'm not letting it go ever. Ever. Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are.\n[Applause]\nWhy would you have to change your pants to let us know\n[Applause]\nwho the pedophiles are? And why wouldn't you be wearing pants while you're researching this? And that was before the Trump administration took power. And by the way, they were still hyping the Epstein files after they took power. We have uh flight logs. We have information names uh that will come out. President Trump has given a very strong directive and that's going to be followed. So people can expect actual movement on this. It's not just empty promises. Oh, Donald Trump doesn't make empty promises. Right. Two of his wives and 10,000 unpaid contractors disagree. But these are all these are all people who work for Trump that set the expectation. And I think because of that, surprisingly, MAGA World for the first time in memory isn't just slavishly acquiescing to Trump's reality distortion field. Where did that whole case go? Where did all the files go? They just went nowhere. No one even believes that. This stinks. This this just reeks. Something is horribly wrong here. Pam Bondi needs to be fired. Yes, Pam Bondi, the ring leader. She makes the decisions. The backlash wouldn't die. So Trump had to go back out and kill the backlash, perhaps even making it look like a suicide. So,\n[Applause]\nso this weekend, you heard him, John. That's outrageous. So, this weekend, Trump tried to reason with his base using their shared love language, long rambling truth social posts. In his social media post, the president asked his followers what's going on with my boys and in some cases gals. Let me stop you right there. Not to be all woke, but I believe they prefer the terms bros and hoes. It's all right. Go on. You were explaining why it was time to move on from the Epstein case. Why are we giving publicity to files written by Obama, crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the losers and criminals of the Biden administration who conned the world with the Russia Russia Russia hoax, 51 intelligence agents, the laptop from hell, and more.\n[Applause]\nSo, just to understand this, in a few months time, we went from the Epstein files will expose the Democrats to the Epstein files were written by the Democrats and therefore can't be trusted. So, let's move on. And then Trump brings up Hunter Biden's laptop as a reminder for all of us not to dwell on old conspiracy theories. What?\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nSo, problem solved, right, MAGA world? Well, let's test it scientifically. How many of you are satisfied? You can you can clap. Satisfied with the results of the Epstein investigation. Clap. How many of you are not satisfied with the results of the investigation? Let me hear everyone who thinks sex trafficking should still be prosecuted say, \"Hell yeah.\" Hell yeah. Who wants to know more about a cabal of elite sex criminals? Just the ladies.\n[Applause]\nSo MAGA World is now an open revolt. You want to know how bad it's getting out there? They're literally burning their MAGA army uniforms. Yeah. And you know, there's just another guy standing next to him going, \"Uh, you know, you got to flip them. That's your problem. You got to flip.\" But clearly telling your base to just forget about Epstein isn't working. But if you know Trump, he can always just pivot to the classic Trump distraction. Throw something outlandish out there and watch the dogs chase the squirrel. I'm going to invade Greenland. I'm gonna bomb Iran. He's gonna try something big. President Trump is reigniting his decadesl long feud with comedian Rosie O'Donnell. I think we're going to need a bigger boat. That's not going to be enough. The president taking to his social media platform to write in part, quote, I'm giving serious consideration to taking away her citizenship. She's a threat to humanity and should remain in the wonderful country of Ireland if they want her. Don't look at our inaction at prosecuting a sex trafficking ring to the rich and powerful. We must focus on the real issue, the dennaturalization of the co-star of riding the bus with my sister.\n[Applause]\nYeah, MAGA is losing their [ __ ] right now. They cannot believe what they're seeing. Trump is lying, dismissing reasonable concerns as bad faith, whining, attacking anyone who disagrees. Well, as a resident of blue America, can I just say right now to my red colleagues that my pronouns are how does and my ass tastes.\n[Applause]\nYou like it? The Trump that you're just experiencing now to your deep disappointment and dismay is the dude we've been dealing with the wholeing time. You just didn't realize it cuz he's been nice to you like when you've had a terrible tragedy. My administration is doing everything in its power to help Texas. She gave them uh all the money, all the help that they can possibly use. We've given them max. We've maxed out and we'll continue to max out. Whatever you need, daddy's here because you're the child he wanted. But we're Eric and this truly just a weird cheap shot. This is how we get treated. I don't think we should give California anything. I mean, if I've given California money, then every state that didn't vote for me will think I'm their president, too. That's not a precedent I want to set. We are on week two of the MAGA civil war over the Epstein files, and the Trump administration can't get its stories straight. There was a client list, then there was no client list. They were going to release all the files, and then they decided not to release any files. So, so let's see what today's excuse is. I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by the Biden, you know. Okay. Cool. Cool. As a cucumber, this guy's not worried about a thing. So, so let me get this straight. According to Trump, all the top Democrats got together and said, \"Let's create some fake files that destroy Trump's political career.\" They don't ever use them. They let Trump get elected. Don't use them. Let Trump get elected again. Still don't use them. And then once he's the president, hope he releases the files without ever looking at them. Frankly, You know, that plan sounds so inconceivably bad. I do believe the Democrats might have come up with it. But Trump Trump clearly wants everyone just to move on. And after initially pushing back, some of them are getting the message. I think the DOJ should immediately move to unseal all the Epstein documents in the Southern District of New York. I think every file should be released to the public the same way as the JFK files. Honestly, I'm done talking about Epstein for the time being. I'm going to trust my friends in the administration. I'm going to trust my friends in the government to do what needs to be done. Solve it. Balls in their hands. Oh, wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. The balls in their hands, he says. Probably not the phrase I would use when talking about the Epstein Files. The ball's in their hands. The shaft is in the course. The taint is in the bread basket. What the we doing here? A phrase you don't hear conspiracy theorists, freeth thinkers utter a whole lot is, I'm going to trust my friends in the government on this one. Clearly, this issue has MAGA on its\n\n\nHeels, which means now is the time for Democrats to strike. Democrats, show us what you got. Congressman Hank Johnson coming to give you some more ear candy or perhaps an ear ache.\n\nYou must be blind. You've been telling us to release the bomb. But where are they?\n\nYou know, maybe I was too harsh on the J6 choir. You know, I I just feel for his poor age who probably spent all week having to help him with this. Like, Rebecca, quick, give me a list of all the words that rhyme with suicide, please.\n\nBut it's a fluid situation right now, and MAGA is trying to wrap their heads around it because they have a lot of unanswered questions.\n\nThere are a lot of unanswered questions, but the biggest question is just what on earth is going on? I don't know what's happening.\n\nIt doesn't make sense. I can't reconcile this Donald Trump with the Trump that we're seeing right now. The Trump that is gaslighting the public right now.\n\nYeah. Okay. Okay. You know, yeah. This is a tough one. Why is Donald Trump refusing to release the Epstein files and telling everyone to shut up and move on? Well, okay.\n\n[Applause]\n\nLet me offer one possible theory. Perhaps you've heard of AAM's razor. It's the idea that the most simple explanation is probably the correct one. In the case of Trump and the Epstein files, let's call our theory AAM's giant machete.\n\nBy now, you've probably heard that Donald Trump, Jeffrey Epstein, and Epstein's partner Galain Maxwell used to be friends, but it's worth understanding how close this friendship was. Trump says he's known Epstein since the late 80s and pictures from the 90s show the president with Maxwell who became Epstein's girlfriend.\n\nThere were neighbors in Palm Beach. At one point Epstein was a member at Mara Lago.\n\nIt's party time at Donald Trump's Mara Lago and among the guests, Jeffrey Epstein. Come on in.\n\nTrump and Epstein can be seen ogling the cheerleaders. Trump points one of them out and says, \"She's hot.\" Then he says something in Epstein's ear that has the financeier doubled up in laughter.\n\nNo.\n\nOkay. Now, hey, hey, hey, hey. What did Trump say? It's impossible to know.\n\nAnd Donald Trump and Epste didn't just party together. They were neighbors. Epste said he was Trump's closest friend for 10 years. In fact, Epstein's infamous little black book included 14 different numbers for Trump and his representatives. I mean, he had 14 separate ways to contact Donald Trump. I mean, when I drop my kid off at camp, I give two emergency contact numbers. And one of them is fake cuz I don't need the hassle. All right.\n\nAnd these guys didn't just party together. Epstein was a part of some major milestones in Trump's life. Jeffrey Epstein uh introduced uh Melania to Donald Trump.\n\nTrump was a frequent passenger on Epstein's plane known as the Lolita Express. And Epstein told author Michael Wolf, \"The first time he slept with Melania was on my plane.\"\n\nAnd that is how I met your mother, Baron.\n\nAny questions?\n\nI'll tell you, next time you're on a flight with a crying baby, just uh think about how much worse it could be.\n\nAll right, so right now you might be thinking, \"Fine, they were friends. They hung out. That doesn't mean Trump knew about what Epstein was doing.\" And you know what? Maybe not. But he clearly had some idea. In a 2002 interview with New York Magazine, Trump showered praise on Epstein, calling him a quote terrific guy and saying, \"It is even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\"\n\nDo you know how creepy with women you have to be for Donald Trump to pick up on it? I mean, that that's a real your drunk friend taking the car keys from you moment.\n\nAnd you could still say, \"So what?\" They were close friends. They were mile high club pals. That that still doesn't mean that Trump is in the files. And maybe.\n\nBut after Jeffrey Epste, the only person left who knew all his secrets was Galileain Maxwell. And when she got charged with sex trafficking, Trump's response was surprisingly sympathetic.\n\nI haven't really been following her too much. I just wish her well, frankly. Uh I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach. And I guess they lived in Palm Beach, but I wish her well. Whatever it is, you wish her well.\n\nIs that the right response? I think there's a reason they don't have that section in the Hallmark store. It's not there.\n\nIt's not.\n\nLet's be clear. Law and Order SVU doesn't start like in the criminal justice system. Sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous and we wish the perpetrators well done.\n\nOkay. You know what? You know what? You want to take another shot at it? Maybe. Maybe even more flailing and desperate.\n\nYeah. I wish you well. I'd wish you well. I'd wish a lot of people well. And I do wish you well. I'm not looking for anything bad for her. I'm not looking bad for anybody.\n\nWhat are you talking about? You wish bad things on everybody. Suddenly you're wishing Galain well. You were harder on Kristen Stewart for cheating on Robert Patson.\n\nOkay. All right. All right. All right. So, so to sum up to all the MAGA people who are so confused about why Trump doesn't want to release any of these files, maybe the answer has something to do with AAM's giant [ __ ] machete. Let's kick things off with America's big, beautiful boss, Donald Trump. He was at a conference in Pennsylvania yesterday to discuss AI, his go-to technology for giving Jessica Rabbit three giant boobs.\n\nAnd if you're curious what the commander-in-chief's thoughts were about the technology that will change our future, too bad. He decided to weave.\n\nWhen I first heard about AI, you know, it's not my thing. Although my uncle was at MIT, one of the great professors, 51 years, whatever he was, longest serving professor in the history of MIT, three degrees in uh nuclear, chemical, and math. That's a smart man. That's both right there. Uh\n\nI hate to be nitpicky, but I'm a stickler for facts. Yes, Trump's uncle was a famous MIT professor, but he wasn't the longest serving professor in MIT history, and he didn't have a degree in nuclear or chemical or math.\n\nAgain, sorry to nitpick, you were saying about your your genius uncle.\n\nKazinski was one of his students. Do you know who Kazinski was? There's very little difference between a mad man and a genius.\n\nWow.\n\nWe went from zero to uni bomber like that.\n\nOkay, I I don't want to be that guy, but it's unlikely that the uniomber Ted Kazinski was a student of Trump's uncle at MIT because Kazinski never went to MIT.\n\nNow, maybe maybe maybe Trump just misspoke, made a slip. I mean, who among us hasn't accidentally told people that our uncle taught the uni bomber?\n\nI once told people my nana gave piano lessons to John Wayne Gayy. Not sure why. I don't know. It just came out. I was probably nervous. The problem The problem with this little fib is that it was the cornerstone of an entire fantasy conversation Trump had with his uncle.\n\nWhat kind of a student was he, Uncle John? Dr. John Trump. He said, \"What kind of a student?\" Manny said good. He said he'd correct. He'd go around correcting everybody, but it didn't work out too well for him. Didn't work out too well. Wow.\n\nAn amazing story that once again absolutely never happened because nobody knew who Kazinski was until 1996 and Trump's uncle died in 1985.\n\n[Applause]\n\nWhat I'm saying is, isn't it great that we finally have a president whose brain works perfectly?\n\nBut it's not surprising that Trump would want to escape into a fantastical world of uniomber fanfiction right now because back in the real world, he's still got all his supporters breathing down his neck to release the Epstein files. And and no matter what Trump does, he just can't get them to shut up about it. I know you've urged people to move on, but I'm curious. Why do you think your supporters in particular have been so interested in the Epstein story about how it's been handled?\n\nI don't understand it. Uh why they would be so interested. He's dead for a long time. Uh he was never a big factor in terms of life.\n\n[Applause]\n\nNot the guy you call to give a eulogy.\n\n[Applause]\n\nAlso, you don't have to like Epstein, but he clearly was a big factor in terms of life. He's he's America's most famous sex criminal, which is quite a competitive category.\n\n[Applause]\n\nThis really highlights Trump's dilemma. He's he's desperate to tamp down the drama, but his entire career has only taught him to heighten the drama. You can't spend your whole life as the messy [ __ ] from a reality show and then suddenly say, \"Can we have some decorum here, please?\"\n\nCuz this does not sound like Donald Trump.\n\nBut I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It's pretty boring stuff. It's sorted, but it's boring.\n\nIt's boring. Oh, yeah. What's interesting about a global pedophile sex ring that involves the richest people in the world that I might be covering up in my own involvement in news alerts.\n\nAnyway, who wants to hear about my copper tariffs? That's juicy.\n\nSo, MAGA dieards, you've heard your dear leader. Epste's just a boring dead guy who no one cares about. I'm sure you'll join him in saying it's time to move on.\n\nNothing more to see here. We should put everything out there and let the people decide it. And I think that the American people need to see what's in there and that's not hard to understand.\n\nI do think there needs to be more transparency.\n\nYou don't believe what the Justice Department is saying?\n\nI don't know. No, I don't. I don't. I think I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I I don't I don't I don't trust I don't I don't trust nothing no more. I'm go just fill my pocket with rocks and walk into the sea. Tell Manu Raju I love him. I mean, things are so bad. Even Lauren Boowbert is demanding answers. Although Although being Lauren Boowbert, she has a a particular way of putting it.\n\nOf course, we want answers. No one is is satisfied with with what has been received or lack thereof. Um, no one is satisfied with the roll out of this.\n\nYes, Mr. present. If Lauren Boowbert was in charge, you better believe she would leave people satisfied.\n\nShe She would not be jerking everyone around and then leaving them frustrated like you. No sir, with her there would be a complete finish.\n\nThis is a shocking turn of events for Donald Trump. His own sick fans are breaking ranks with him and even worse, they are demanding accountability. I think moving forward, we need a special counsel. That has got to happen. I want answers. Um, and maybe that takes that special counsel to do so. Maybe Matt Gates can lead the special counsel.\n\n[Applause]\n\nYou want Matt Gates to investigate underage sex trafficking?\n\nBecause it makes sense in a sort of game recognized game way.\n\nI can see Matt Gates pulling up to R. Kelly's house saying, \"I'm putting together a team.\"\n\nAlso, legally, I have to introduce myself. Uh, and this special counsel thing might have been the last straw because by this morning, Trump had absolutely lost it on his supporters.\n\nHe posted this morning, he said, \"My past supporters have bought into this quote [ __ ] hook, line, and sinker. Don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success because I don't want their support anymore.\n\nGod damn. He went he went full messy [ __ ]\n\nIf you can't handle me at my sex crimes cover up, you don't deserve me at my alligator concentration camps, you [ __ ]\n\n[Applause]\n\nOkay. All right. So Trump is in a brutal spot right now, but like any good reality show producer knows, always leave room for reconciliation, and Trump might have done that today.\n\nMr. President, will you ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to release more documents to finally put this controversy to bed?\n\nWhatever is credible, she can release. If if a document is credible, if a document's there that is credible, she can release.\n\nYou hear that? Those documents are coming. Or Donald Trump's uncle wasn't Ted Kazinsk's favorite teacher. We all know President Trump has spent the last two weeks in a wrestling match with the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein. But he's been fighting the last 6 months with a much more alive person, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. And boy does Trump hate the guy.\n\nJerome Powell has done a terrible job. And frankly, I don't think he could do a worse job. We have a a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed. He's an average mentally person. I'd say low in terms of what he does. Low uh low IQ for what he does. Okay.\n\nBut this, you know numb skull. He's a num skull.\n\nI think he's a total stiff. You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a nothings. It's like talking to a chair. No personality.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know whatever happened to all of our exciting dynamic Federal Reserve chairs.\n\nWho doesn't remember Fed Chairman Dirks McGinty? Huh? Did he crash the economy? Yes. That guy was radical.\n\nNow, you may be wondering what Jerome Powell ever did to make Trump so angry. I mean, the way Trump talks about him, you you'd think they caught him at a Coldplay concert with Trump's wife.\n\nBut at its heart, this is a beef about economics. Trump wants to lower interest rates to help juice the economy. But Jerome Powell is in charge of setting those interest rates, and he refuses to lower them because he's worried that will increase inflation. And and nothing nothing makes Trump angrier than someone doing their job well.\n\nWe should have cut interest rates a long time ago. Europe has cut them 10 times in the short period of time, and we cut them none. The only time he cut him was just before the election to try and help Kamala or Biden, whoever the hell it was, because nobody really knew. How did that work out? You'll tell me. It didn\n\n\nIt didn't work out too well, did it?\nBy the way, if you're wondering what this guy has to do with any of this, I'll tell you nothing.\nThat's the crown prince of Bahrain.\nHe flew across the planet to talk about peace in the Middle East, and now he just has to sit there while Trump works himself up over some personal [ __ ].\nIt's like when you were at your friend's house for dinner and get dragged into their parents' fight, you know.\nOh.\nOh, you know what?\nLet's ask Timmy.\nTimmy, is four beers a normal amount to drink at breakfast?\nTell him.\nTell Mr. Patterson.\nBut yeah, sorry, your highness.\nIt doesn't matter what you were here for.\nJust buckle up and enjoy the ride.\nHe's a terrible Fed chair.\nI was surprised he was appointed.\nI was surprised, frankly, that uh Biden put him in.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWhy did Joe Biden put Jerome Powell in?\nLet's go back to when Joe Biden appointed Jerome Powell and see what Joe Biden said about him.\nIt is my pleasure and my honor to announce my nomination of Jerome Powell to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nHe's strong.\nHe's committed.\nHe's smart.\nDamn, man.\nJoe Biden looks fat as [ __ ].\nHey, I get it.\nI'm also trying desperately to forget everything that happened during Trump's first term.\nSo now you might be wondering if Trump hates this guy so much, why doesn't he just fire him?\nWell, he's been threatening to pretty much non-stop ever since he won the election, but you tell me if Powell seems phased by it.\nSome of the president's elect advisers have suggested that you should resign.\nUm, if he asked you to leave, would you go?\nNo.\nUh, can you follow up on is do you think that legally that you're not required to leave?\nNo.\nOkay, you don't want to spin it.\nDo a little grandstanding.\nYou know the camera's on.\nGive it a little rasle dazzle.\nBig Jay, come on.\nBut no, no.\nJerome Powell truly does not give a about Trump's threats.\nTo follow up on Victoria's question, um, do you believe the president has the power to fire or demote you?\nNot permitted under the law.\nNot what?\nNot permitted under the law.\nWow.\nHe actually he went on to add, \"Try me, bitch.\"\nAlthough, you know, just one more quick follow-up.\nChairman Powell, do you think I can pull off jean shorts?\nNot permitted under\nharsh, but fair.\nBut Powell is right.\nThe president can't actually fire him.\nThe position of Fed chairman was designed to be independent from the president to ensure that his decisions will be made free of political pressure.\nBut Trump thinks he found a loophole.\nYesterday, the president suggested a caveat that he could remove Chairman Powell if there is cause.\nHe has accused Powell of fraud related to the Fed's multi-year $2 billion renovation project.\nHe spent $2.5 billion dollars to to I guess it's a renovation.\nI don't know.\nThe one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in.\nAnd now on top of it, he's building a close to $3 billion little nest egg for himself.\nHe's doing a little renovation for 2.5 billion of the Fed.\n[Applause]\nYes, I' I've been here this entire time.\n[Applause]\nBy the way, it's crazy to hear Trump complain about the Federal Reserve palace while he's sitting in his gold bedazzled office.\nAnd that Jerome Powell sure is extravagant.\nDon't you agree?\nGoldplated eagle holding up a marble end table.\nBut on the other hand, Trump's smear campaign is having an effect.\nSome of these charges of extravagant spending got to the point where Powell had to deny them under oath.\nThe media reports that you actually accurately quoted, they're misleading and and inaccurate in in many many respects.\nThere's no new marble.\nThere no special elevators.\nThere are no new water features.\nThere's no beehives.\nWhat?\nNo beehives?\nNot even one.\nWell, now I'm worried Jerome Powell isn't spending enough on the renovations.\nHow can I trust a Fed chairman who isn't licking honey up his fist like Winnie the Pooh?\nIt seems like they're now trying to make the renovation sound as shitty as possible.\nNo water feature, no special elevators, and worst of all, they're dismantling the skate park for Dirks McGinty.\n[Music]\n",
