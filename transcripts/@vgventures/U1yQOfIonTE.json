  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHi, I'm David, and this is Build to Succeed from Very Good Ventures. Today we speak with Kevin Smith and Mikel Corcuera, the co-founders of the AI-powered podcast app Snipd. In this episode, we learn about their experience building with AI to create an innovative product that uses AI. So, let's build some knowledge. Hi, Kevin and Mikel. Welcome to the Build to Succeed podcast. Thanks for joining us today.\nHi, David. Thanks for having us.\nYeah, thank you. Thanks so much.\nAbsolutely. So, um, given uh, what you guys do, I wanted to maybe get us started with just a little quick question of so what is your favorite podcast at the moment? Given that I'm sure you guys are seeing quite a lot of podcasts these days.\nMel, you want to start?\nYeah, I can start. I'm currently listening to Legacy. It's two reporters who tell the story about famous and influential people. I'm currently listening to the episode about Freud. Well, the episodes, four episodes per person, more or less. And yeah, it's the Freud episode. And yeah, it was recommended by my girlfriend who's a psych a psychologist. So yeah, that's why started with that one. Check that one out.\nYeah, I'm a big fan of Lennyâ€™s Podcast as an example. Uh, Lenny is a former product manager from Airbnb, and he has startup people on, product people, founders, and basically they talk about building products, growing product. Um, and yeah, it it's always super interesting. You always has super interesting guests on, so I can very much recommend it.\nNice. Yeah, we'll have to get links from you guys and we'll throw them in the in the show notes for people who want to check those out. So, given the question about podcasts, maybe we should give a little backstory around why we would start there. So, maybe for those people out there who haven't uh used Snipd yet or or have come across it, can you guys explain a little bit about what it is and maybe try to like what's the elevator pitch, the quick summary of what you guys do?\nYeah. Yeah. Um, definitely. Okay. So, Snipd is an AI-powered podcast app for everyone who listens to podcasts. I would say just as your audience who listen to podcasts to learn, follow their curiosity. So, we have a lot of AI-powered features like you can chat with the episode. You get AI-generated chapters. We also generate little mini bios for each guest. But the feature that we're most known for and also where our name Snipd comes from is the ability to save any insight that you hear in a podcast simply by triple tapping your headphones. So how that works is whenever you hear an amazing insight, you triple tap your headphones and our AI summarizes the insight that you just heard and saves that together with the original clip. And all of this together we call a snip and uh we call it nipping.\nI love it. So, what's the story that led to this? How did you guys um come across this idea? What led you to each other, I guess, to start Snipd? And where did you get this uh kind of concept that you wanted to commit all your time and energy to it?\nYeah, I mean, in a way, it's interesting because I think that the answer to both of those questions, it's almost the same same answer. So my personal story it starts with I before starting Snipd, I joined an early-stage tech startup here in here in Zurich, and it was my very first experience in working at a startup, and even though one of the things I had studied before that, so I studied mathematics and economics, you would think that if you study economics that they would teach you anything about how to build a business than like become a startup, but of course they don't. So I had no idea how any of this work. So what the founder did, he was um, he recommended this podcast to me called How to Start a Startup by Sam Altman back when he was CEO Y Combinator, and I listened to this podcast, and for anyone who doesn't know it, it's basically it was a it was a lecture at Stanford, every episode was one lecture, and they would have a one of the biggest best entrepreneur uh that we've been in the last 20 years be the guest, and they would just talk about one topic. Um, for example, there was Dustin Moskovitz from from Facebook or Paul Graham, Peter Teal. Uh, Peter Teal is the founder of PayPal. So, here I was in Zurich like in Switzerland where we're based, uh, riding my bike to work every morning and learning from these incredible people that are living on the other side of the planet. And best of all, I'm doing all of this while not even losing time because I'm I would ride my bike to work anyway in the morning. So this was how I got into podcasts and really learned or or realized for myself how podcasts are one of the largest knowledge libraries in the world that humans have ever created, and it's this very enjoyable way of consuming information. But of course I ran into a lot of issues like you know you'd be on your bike, the typical thing is you hear this amazing insight, you know Peter Teal drops some contrarian knowledge and you want to remember that, you're like, \"Oh my god, I need to tell my team, it's such an amazing insight.\" So, what do you do? You know, you have to get off your bike, uh, take out your phone, open up the notes app, like write down what you just heard, maybe save the the timestamp, maybe take a screenshot to remember the timestamps to be able to come back to it. So, you do that a couple of times, but then after the third or fourth or fifth time, you're like, \"Okay, come on. This is too cumbersome. I'll remember it.\" Yeah. And then you get to the office and of course, you've forgotten about it. A couple of days later, you might remember again. And then you try to find it again in the podcast, but of course you can't because it's all in audio. So you use that skip 30-second button like 500 times. And once you do find it again, you want to share it with your, you know, with your colleagues. So you send them the episode and of course they don't listen to it because at the end of the day, it's a two-hour conversation. So yeah, these were all of the issues that I that I experienced. Um, long story short, another friend of mine, Ferdinand, who's not with us here today, he and I, we were talking about this, both our background is in AI, and he was saying like, hey, I have the same issues, and given that our background was in AI. So this is before ChatGPT came along. We we thought, hey, there's a better way of solving that with all of the advancements that are happening. We should be able to create a more usable and and and um delightful experience.\nYeah.\nSo that's sort of how I started, and maybe Mikel, you can you can uh you can tell the story how you got got into this.\nYeah. I mean I I I met Kevin in that startup, in the startup we worked before before Snipd, and I came to Snipd in a different way. I I was there working as as a frontal engineer, was there for four years, and at some point I wanted to to do something different. We were working with web technologies with Angular. I was already yeah I heard about Flutter from our CTO back then. I mean he was a back end developer. He he learned about Flutter. He was excited about it. I said okay let's let's give it a try just to learn something new. And I really started liking it. I was wow I I really like the developer experience. I really like where this is going. I also liked it because it was new for me, right? I wanted to build an app. Yeah. After some point with that I got a little bit bored also the product we were building and I decided to to leave and I said okay I leave and I figure out what I do. One thing I was clear for me was I wanted to learn Flutter in between jobs just to see whether I will land a a job with Flutter or not. And I wanted to find job where I will build a product for consumers. In the previous startup it was B2B to see, and even though we were building something for the end user, it was very hard to see that connection. So we were building something the bankers will see it. I had no idea how people were using it, whether people were using it. So that failed for me, right? I mean it was like not very connected to the product.\nSo yeah I decided to learn Flutter and I knew that Kevin and Freddy were were building something. I had no idea what it was. I said, \"Yeah, I mean, I rather learn Flutter while doing something that makes sense, some cool idea, than just do another to-do app because, yeah, it's like the usual learning exercise, right?\" So, I talked to them. I said, \"Okay, I have three months in between jobs. Let's let's get together. I will help you build the UI because they really needed help in that area. They had some some some prototype that's better that never sees the light of day.\" And so, yeah, then I started working with them. But basically for me, it was a learning exercise, right? I said, \"Okay, while I while I find another job.\" And time passed. I was doing interviews with other companies. And at some point, I had two two offers. Plus, I was still excited to work with them. And yeah, the three of us sat together, well, in a meeting because I was in Spain back then. And yeah, I decided to say no to those to those offers. And yeah, they offered me to join Snipd as a co-founder. I mean, it was still not founded, but joining as it was the three of the three of us were found the company. And I said okay why not if I don't do it now I mean I had yeah I don't have kids I don't have family so it was why not I mean I really enjoyed what we are doing here I think the idea was amazing and the experience of building something from scratch and the idea that that would be used by someone we still didn't have a prototype that we released but it was something that I was so passionate about being able to build the app have it in my hands and knowing that that would be the thing that the user will use. Uh so I decided okay let's let's go with it and that's how I started the yeah that's how I joined how I joined them and that was yeah you're already four years ago more or less right\nuh yeah so yeah then we decided to start and that's when we started really building iterating over the idea and finally releasing the first the first version of the app.\nThat's great. I love the uh the sort of origin stories here because you know Kevin, you identified a need based on your own personal experience, you know, trying to listen to those. I know exactly what you're talking about. You know, there's podcasts I listen to. Um, there's one I really love called Two Bobs, and it's like they have so many insights that it's just like if I go for a walk and listen to that, I'm just basically my head's down in the notes app the whole time like writing notes. And so something like Snipd comes along and you're like, \"Oh, this is doing that same thing and giving me the opportunity to collect those things and mark those insights.\" So you building it from that insight and being like, you know, hey, I I have this need and from that sort of position of of uh personal desire and I think so many products have come from that. And then Mikuela on your side, it's like, well, okay, I want to build something that actually I want to use that like is something useful for me, even if it wasn't the thing that you originally dreamt up for yourself. It's like, so there's just a really interesting insight there of like how these things and teams materialize, which I think is is a lot of fun. And I do want to get into the technical details of how you guys have built it because there's some AI stuff. But before going that far, given it was like a personal idea and you know podcasts are pretty popular, one of the things I would imagine would be difficult is to figure out like the initial feature set for this, right? You have all this AI change. People consume these things in different ways. You have people riding a bike, walking down the street, in a car, sitting on a couch, right? For different reasons. Some people do it for entertainment. Some people do it for learning and personal development. So when you were getting started, how did you really decide like what the user really wanted? And maybe like over time has the feature set changed like from the idea phase to what it ended up being like how did the actual concept develop over time?\nYeah, this is this is actually quite interesting because now looking back when we had the first conversation and we're prototyping first versions, we did not think that the the aspect of saving the inside would be the biggest part of it. We thought the big thing is discovery because we saw what we saw was if we have users who are saving the best insights in podcasts, there would be 10 100 times more people who would want to just discover them, right? So it's almost in a way the idea was almost a little bit like a Tik Tok for podcast that we then sort of like came to be like when when when talking with one another where a certain section of users would create snips while listening and another section would just consume these snips or use them as a discovery tool. So when when we actually then started to create the first versions that we got into people's hands, we thought the difficult thing will be to get people to create snips. Um like we didn't think that you know I didn't think that I was actually that that there were so many other people like me and then everyone would consume them. But once we gave people uh the prototypes, what we saw found out was actually exactly the opposite is that all of them were creating snips and they weren't weren't just creating one snip in episode but you know like 10 snips in and I really loved that.\nSo this was sort of how it's it's almost like the feature set didn't really change but the the the focus on what we like what was the main thing that we put front and center uh that then that then changed\nthrough yeah through\nbuilding something and putting into people's hands and then learning from the feedback.\nHow did you collect that feedback? Did you just talk to your users? Did you have like a feedback capture tool? I'm just curious how you uncovered that insight.\nUh yeah I mean that that has uh developed quite a bit in the over the years. So in the very beginning I mean we didn't have a app live right so we were just on test bite so this was just talking to friends giving it to friends asking them to use it and then once we had a version live then we always had a big feedback button at the top of uh the home\n\n\nScreen where they could immediately give us feedback, and that was, I think, one of the most important things that we did in the beginning.\n\nUm, to really have that front and center, it actually took up a lot of face. Um, so any designer would have hated it. But yeah, that's the way how we collected the feedback. It was just, it was just a Google form behind it, you know, like there was no fancy whatever. That that worked quite great.\n\nThat's awesome. Nice. Well, so let's get into the technical side of things, right? Because you have an AI story here, and of course, AI is super uh, hot right now. And I think you guys got started with it, I think, before all this became super hyped, like, because you, you know, you've been working on this for four years and had these ideas from the beginning, and the AI was part of the genesis of, like, what you could do here. So maybe, like, walk us through a little bit about some of the technical choices you've made along the way, um, both in terms of how you decided to build it, how, how did you sort of prototype this? You mentioned getting, you know, getting some test flights out and things. And then maybe, um, how has the technology really driven your approach to the user experience itself in terms of what the product actually does?\n\nYeah, maybe, maybe I can answer that. I think at the beginning, the most important thing for us was not that much about the technology we were using, but that we wanted to ship something as fast as we could to get feedback. And at the beginning, yeah, the, the reason we decided for Flutter, it was because I was learning Flutter, and it was, okay, I will learn Flutter with this, right? Kevin and Freddy, they knew Python, so they will do all the backing in Python, right? So for us, the main focus was, okay, let's get something out as fast as possible with for our friends and family first, then to test flight, and then to the App Store. And I think in total, it took us less than six months to go all through that process. I still think that the decision of using Flutter was the right one. Uh, we were able to, at the beginning, it was only me working on the app side. Now we are only two, right? So it's a pretty Small Team, and the reason we can have both an iOS and an Android app is because we use Flutter, or we could have used another, I don't know, React Native or something like that. But I think Flutter has allowed us to, to build fast and to build an app that looks very nice. I think one thing that people talk a lot about when talking about Flutter is this developer experience and reload, and I think it's not only important for the developer that that's there. So yeah, of course, I like working with Flutter because the developer experience is much nicer than maybe Angular, but I think that is reflected also on the product at the end because I have joy creating the UI. I will go the extra mile and try to make it much nicer. I will also be faster because of the iterations of the UI. I mean, we know how it works, right? We also don't have a designer, or I mean, we work all as a designers, or me, I work as a designer, but I don't usually do it on Figma, right? Because Flutter is so fast to iterate on, we can really just start building, uh, do maybe a few prototypes in Figma, then jump directly to code, and because it's so fast to iterate, move the button here, put this, this color here, wherever you, you want, I think it allows us to go to the end result much faster. And one thing that is very important, important for us also, is the interactions, like how the user uses the app and how it feels, it's not that how it looks, right? And I think that's very hard to, to replicate on Figma. And with Flutter, you can really have the app in your hands, change a value somewhere, try it again, see how this scrolling feels, see how this animation feels. And I think with other frameworks, that will take you, like, maybe to restart the app, go back to the, to the screen you were before, replicate the state, and the whole process takes you much longer. So I think the willingness from the developer to creator is sometimes not there, or sometimes the time is not there. So I really think that Flutter allows you to, to create this polish experiences that is so much harder in other Apps. And I think in the way the developer is also, I think they have more joy using Flutter than, at least for me, than using, let's say, Angular to create these polish experiences. So I'm still quite happy that we use it. I mean, we, of course, have found that some things are not as easy in Flutter, everything that have to do with native code or native interactions. It's always a step you have to take another step. You have to integrate it with a plug-in. You have to create the plug-in yourself. So sometimes it's not as easy to interact with the native side. But all in all, I'm, I'm quite happy that we, we decided to use it.\n\nThat's like a really interesting use case for startups there, too, right? Where if you have engineers who are, uh, have a good visual eye, sort of there's the traditional designer developer handoff where, like, you do everything in Figma and then you document that, and you hand it off to the engineers who, who implement it. But I think that's an interesting insight in terms of, especially if you're trying to do something fast that's new to the world, where you're trying to test it. Do that quick prototype in Figma that gives you the direction, and then just get in there and just start doing the last, you know, 20% in code itself.\n\nYeah. Yeah, and I think one, one thing that it's important of doing it in code is, like, you have so many different cases, right? I mean, I don't know if you, anyone who has built a UI knows that, okay, the designer will test these few fields with a nice case, right? A small title with, like, a small description, but then you use the app, and there is people, like, I don't know, I mean, there are some podcasts that have, like, five lines or title, right? And it doesn't look nice on Figma. Like, if you put it there and you just use their design, it doesn't look nice. So I think by using real data also while you are designing the app, it also allows you to catch these cases much earlier and try to figure out a solution for those. And I think just feeling it in your hand is also a big thing, right? I mean, it can look nice on Figma, but then you use it, and it's, okay, this doesn't work.\n\nYeah, no, totally, no, that makes total sense. And that's where that, you're right, the hot reload and even just the ability to iterate quickly and get it on different devices and understand even, even on iOS or Android, does this interaction need to be a little different on Android because of something about the OS or something that you really sometimes can't tell until you put on on a real device and give it a try.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you're right about all those states, right? Like one of the hard things is, like, I think, you know, really great creative designers, they want to do the big picture stuff, you know, they want to, like, um, build really cool interfaces. They don't necessarily want to, like, tell you all the 37 different states that can happen when you're trying to enter a password on the login form, you know. Um, but those things are, like, really easy to figure out once you're in there trying to, like, writing the code, figuring out all the different situations you're trying to handle.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nThat's awesome. So it sounds like that front end choice, which was out of a, a position of just curiosity and interest on your part, ends up becoming a bit of a strategic advantage for you guys as you get going.\n\nYeah, I would say so. And I think that does allows also to maintain the Small Team, which is also also has some advantages, also maintain only one codebase for both Android and iOS, right? They don't deviate. You don't have to think about when do you release one or the other. So I think it has a lot of advantages.\n\nYou know, it's funny because you mentioned about that factor, right? How it allowed you to get on iOS and Android and prototyping early stages so quickly. And I've been doing Flutter so long now, it's been since 2017 that we pretty much exclusively been writing Apps with Flutter. Yeah.\n\nThat it's almost like I forget that, like, the old way was you had to have two different sets of developers, or you did one and you only did iOS, and then your friends and family who are on Android, you're like, \"Well, if we're successful, I'll get around to building something for you.\" You know? I mean, that's also a, that's also a good decision if you start, I would say, right? I mean, you can also see as soon as you start monetizing, most of the money comes from iOS, right? So that could be one strategy, but as soon as you want to then release on Android, I mean, the work you will have to do to port everything to Android is huge, right? Um, depends on what your App is, you may have to be in both platforms anyway. So yeah, well, and I think the key is, like, you still get that monetization boost from iOS when you focus on one of these multiplatform or crossplatform tools. And I think the truth, like, I think React Native has gotten a lot better, too. Early, early, early iterations and approaches of this stuff were just not quite there. They were substandard, and I think a lot of companies that tried them or teams that were or were or individual developers kind of got burned by it and felt this isn't really quite what I'm looking for. But I think Flutter and React Native have both gotten so good that I don't know. It's kind of crazy why, you know, people would be building fully native at this point for me from my perspective. But I'm a little biased. So\n\nYeah, me too. I'm a little biased.\n\nSo let's talk a little bit about the back end here. You know, it sounds like on the front end, you had a technology choice that helped you iterate really quickly and kind of get out there, and but let's talk about back end. How did you, you mentioned Python, that you guys had experience in Python? Um, how did you go about figuring out what to do, especially with the AI side of it and things like, how did you make some of these tech choices early on?\n\nYeah, I think for the AI, like, I will let Kevin explain how he started them. Yeah, I mean, from the, I think in general on the back end side, the two interesting things in the beginning were, um, what to do with the AI, but also what to do with the data. So maybe that's something for for you, Mikel, to go a bit more into detail, like, because we started with Firestore and then at some point migrated everything over to Postgress. But with the AI, so I mean, back then, just to give a bit more context, so this was, like, four years ago or something like that. So this was long before ChatGPT or ChatGPT APIs were, like, a common thing or even available. So the way that you got AI into your App, it was to have either you built, you trained the model yourself, or you an open source model from Hugging Face, and then you fine-tuned it for your own use case, and then you deployed it on your own servers. And all of the, basically, the entire AI research community, the AI world, uh, was running on Python, and that was also what we had experience in before because we were doing that in our in our shop before. So that was sort of for us an obvious choice. And in the meantime, I think Python has just gotten bigger and bigger because the AI, uh, community has has grown so much. I mean, still Python first in a lot of these cases. So, but yeah, what we did there was we had basically, as as I just mentioned, we had these open source models from Hugging Face that we used, we fine-tuned them. Um, we deployed them on servers that were, like, on GPU servers that were running on on Google Cloud. I guess most of the challenges there that we had were there were many, I would, I would say, dev ops challenges, like, once you had the model working, um, like, actually keeping it running, you know, we didn't just have one model, that's also, like, one big difference these days. Back then, you had for every single task, you had a separate model, and you fine-tuned it to do just that. You couldn't just ask some generic question. It wasn't just like, hey, give me a summary, hey, give me a quick overview, give me a title. So we had, for example, a an an an AI model, or back then you would call it an NLP model, natural language processing model, that would just create a title for a snip. So the input was the transcript of what the what the user saved, and the output was a title. Then we had a completely separate, 100% completely separate weights model that would create a summary, uh, for it. So, um, and so for this, we had so various of these models, and basically on our GPU servers, we were loading them into the GPU memory, um, then unloading them and loading the other one in, and it's just a lot of, there were just a lot of issues of, you know, like, some stuff staying in memory, and at some point, you can't load the new models anymore. Uh, and we had a lot of the lot of issues that we actually never solved. So we had jobs, like, every two days, we would restart the GPU server, like, the the typical things of just like, yeah, just get it to run somehow. So yeah, these, these were sort of the the challenges in the in the early days. And now, in the meantime, that, of course, has changed a lot. We still have some open source models that we're running on our servers, mainly for where we that we have cost advantages, but most of our AI processing is now happening via the the APIs from from charge Google, uh, also Perplexity, we're also using, but that comes with new challenges.\n\nWell, let's, let's dig into this because I'm sure a lot of people out there, you know, AI is such a hot thing right now, and I think that there's a lot of confusion and a lot of anxiety and just a lot of uncertainty around, like, how do you even do these tools? Do I need to be a PhD in math and a and a, you know, AI engineer? What is that even? Do I need to be a data scientist, or is this just hooking up an API like anything else? So, I'd love to dig into this with you guys and maybe start by being, you know, it says powered by AI, right? Snipd is powered by AI. So maybe when you hear a phrase like that, or in your context, when you say it's powered by AI, what does that actually mean to you when you're communicating that?\n\nOh, so this is really a big topic that we have internally. What is, is it AI powered? Is it AI native? Uh, is it even something that we should mention at all? And we've gone back and forth. Now, the reason why we call it an AI-powered podcast App or sometimes AI in Nate podcast App is because these days, we are in this transition phase where it's still something special that your product has AI and at least AI baked in into the core functionality. Um, and that help, you know, gets people interested in, like, oh, what are they doing different? You know, this is something that wasn't possible before. So, um, it creates some curiosity, but to be honest, the way that we're looking at it is, we see AI as it's basically like\n\n\nThe new electricity.\nSo in the future it will just be in everything, and it will be so common that you will not, you will not say the same way today you don't say, \"Hey, I have this electricity powered watch.\"\nLike, no, you just have a watch.\nUm, in the same way in the future, we will not say, \"I have an AI powered podcast.\"\nLike, no, this is just a podcast.\nObviously, it has AI baked to it.\nBut if we use these terms, if we do use them internally, we do actually love the way, like, the term AI native over AI powered because AI native really means to me that you've thought through this from first principles, uh, what is now possible, uh, thanks to that we have this technology, rather than just looking at, \"Ah, this is how we used to do it before,\" and, um, okay, now we just add a little, a little feature or sprinkle on top.\nAnd I think you can see some, some very famous examples is, is Cursor, which, which I assume a lot of your, your audience is familiar with.\nThat was a case where before you had other, you know, you had co-pilot, the GitHub copilot thing, which really much more felt like, \"Okay, it's just now a bit better, better of an autocomplete.\"\nCursor really rethought the whole process of, \"Okay, if we have these powerful tools, like, how can we integrate them much more natively?\"\nSo that's what we, what we try to do, uh, with Snipd, like, really think from first principles.\nI like that.\nThat's, that's so AI native.\nAI powered is that first principles of what can you do with this technology and start there and then build the product idea.\nSo was AI always a part of the product vision from the beginning then?\nUm, because, you know, you said you started four years ago.\nI don't think that this was like a super common thing that everybody starting out was like, \"We're going to use these tools,\" because I think it was daunting, like, building the models and getting into that stuff.\nWhen did AI become a core part of the mission where, like, you really made the product sort of this AI native perspective?\nSo it was from the very beginning.\nSo I mean, this was it basically all comes back to myself and and our other Co-Founder, Fred, and our backgrounds being in AI.\nAnd for me, like, basically Snipd was built on two big, let's say, realizations or beliefs that we have.\nOne is that we see podcast as one of the largest knowledge libraries in the world, and two, we believed early on that AI would fundamentally change how we can interact with spoken audio.\nAnd the, the really, the, the point that that made it clear to me, this realization, much, much like long before ChatGPT came along, was a paper that was published by Facebook's AI team where back in the day what they did was they used the two main technical innovations that have that led to huge breakthroughs in text processing with AI.\nThey applied that, they applied that to speech processing, and it just worked really, really well.\nAnd that for me was the moment where I realized, like, \"Wait, everything that's happening in NLP, like, this text processing at the time, all of that will happen in speech as well.\"\nAnd if you have both of these worlds now, you can do so much more with spoken audio.\nSo yeah, we had that, that vision, uh, from the very beginning, but it wasn't clear from the very beginning what we need to...\nThat's interesting.\nSo then you, what you're not clear what you're able to do, but then you get in there and you start experimenting with these tools, and at the time you didn't have, when you first got started, especially, you didn't have these large language models that are so popular now.\nHow do you go about answering that question, like, what actually is possible?\nHow do you go about experimenting with different open source models and approaches and tools and then figure out a, what's possible reliably, and then b, like, which approach or which tool gives you the best outcome?\nBecause one of the challenges here with AI is they're not deterministic, so you get different outputs each time.\nSo how did you go about making these decisions, right, especially in the early days when you didn't...\nNow it's a little bit more obvious, like, \"Okay, I'm going to use Claude or I'm going to use OpenAI or Gemini.\"\nThere's like some more specific directions, I think, people are more likely to go.\nWhat was your insights in in terms of how can we even today make better choices with these tools?\nYeah, I think again, it has changed quite a lot, like, if you look at back then and and to today.\nSo back then, in a way, now looking back, maybe it was even easier because you had less choice in a way, and it was clear what you had to do there.\nSo there were a couple of open source models, but then you had to take that and you had to fine-tune it for your task, and it was just for a single task usually that you that you did that for, and then you just saw how well that worked.\nLike, the big benefit that we had, and that that I also recommend to anyone working on something today is, like, we didn't aim for perfection.\nYou know, when when I now tell you, like, \"Hey, there was a summary for this Snipd, this insight that you just heard.\"\nToday everyone thinks of this perfect summary because everyone knows what ChatGPT is.\nLike, back then, our summary, like, let's be honest, it was actually crap, but it was sort of good enough to for the really hardcore person who really, really, really wanted this to to use it, and the summaries would sort of, you know, like, every third word or something would sort of make sense, and you'd be like, \"Ah, yeah, yeah, that, you know, like, a couple of keywords triggers, then yeah, they talk about this and about that,\" and then it sort of worked, and we just bet on all of this getting better over time.\nAnd our, like, the way that we actually looked at it was that we thought we would have to do all of the work.\nSo we did not envision these APIs to just come along, especially not this early.\nUm, so we envisioned us having to do the work to to make it better and better and better.\nOf course, with again, standing on the giants of, you know, the open source models, um, that at the time, like, even, even OpenAI was still, uh, open sourcing some models, um, and Facebook was open sourcing a lot of models, but yeah, we thought over time we would, you know, we would get bigger, we would get more successful, we would have more data, we would have more people on the team, and with that, we would, uh, improve these models over time.\nNice.\nSo that's how you can embrace the hallucinations and some of the just with the innate assumption that it's going to get better.\nYeah.\nI mean, that's, that's, um, sort of how we store it back then.\nI mean, now today, I think, like, you know, even the term hallucination back then, it didn't really exist, right?\nI think this is actually more a bigger problem today, especially also for us, because we, we've outgrown the, you know, the early early adopter that forgives everything.\nI think the weirdest hallucination, but the, when it comes to hallucination, I think the, I think the underlying thing that you're referring to is the, it's not deterministic, right?\nThat you have this randomness in there.\nAnd the way that we handle that is, I think that is really something where if you're a programmer, you do have to adjust a bit how to think about coding, and you have to free yourself away from this deterministic flow, and much more the analogy that I like using is having a bunch of interns work for you.\nSo it's like you have, you have a task here, and you hand it off to an intern.\nThe great thing is you don't just have to have one intern.\nYou can have 10 interns, and you can even have interns that judge the output of the other interns, and this is more the analogy that I use to try to handle all of these cases, right?\nLike, if if you have, if you can have as many interns as you like, and you want to improve the quality, I mean, one way is to exactly, you know, split it up, have two people, two interns work on the same thing.\nThey come together, they judge what's what's good, what's not good.\nYou have a third one who's maybe the final decision maker, and all of this, and these are all ways of, of, um, improving the quality and handling these cases.\nYeah.\nAnd maybe this, the, the final thing that that's just important is, like, you have to, you have to live with the fact that it will fail sometimes.\nM.\nLike, you know, this is another thing where, where you have to adapt the way that you think about code, where usually if you've written everything nicely, it shouldn't fail, or if it fails, then there's something, there's a bug and you need to fix it.\nLike, no, it's, it's just, you have to live with a certain percentage, depending on how in, uh, difficult the task is, that that will fail, and then, yeah, fail gracefully, and also the, the end user experience has to reflect that.\nYeah.\nAnd also the, the user has to sort of, yeah, that's, that's just another thought that that just came to mind.\nOne thing that has helped us as well is that we've always been very clear that we are an AI-powered podcast app and that we have AI everywhere.\nAnd so the user then also learned, like, \"Okay, if this is written here, I know it's generated by AI, can I trust it or not?\"\nOr if it's sort of missing some, you know, like, \"Ah, okay, the AI did a mistake here,\" and yeah, that then also helps.\nWell, I think we're in an era too where people are learning to sort of, like, appreciate that because the code is not deterministic, it's kind of just no different than if if a friend of mine listens to our podcast that we're recording, and and I was like, \"Hey, tell me what you think,\" and they give me a summary, they're going to, like, not get it totally right, you know?\nUm, even our memories are are not super good at exactly being factual, right, of this stuff.\nSo, I think people are getting used to that.\nUm, but so you, AI is like everywhere.\nSo, you guys are using AI to actually develop the app, too.\nIs that part of your engineering workflow?\nIs it kind of full stack for you guys?\nEverywhere AI?\nYeah, I mean, we, we, we use, like, I think each one of us and for different tasks, we use it differently, but it's certainly something that is in our workflow, right?\nI think for me, uh, personally, I, I use it different depending on the, the technology I'm using, how familiar I'm with it, what kind of task I have, right?\nWith Flutter, we started, yeah, I, I know the code from A to Z, and yeah, the context is much bigger, right?\nSo I'm there less reliant on AI than, for example, if I'm trying to build something new, right?\nI mean, one good example was how we build a new landing page.\nWe use Vzero.\nI don't know if you're familiar with it.\nIt's from Vert.x.\nThis coding, let's say, uh, tool to to build web apps.\nAnd the cool thing about that is that we, so we are for in the team, right?\nSo, it's two front end people.\nWe also have Freddy who is mainly working on the AI or in the back end, and he started building the the website, right?\nSo the cool thing about Vio and this AI tool was that he was able to create the main content of the app without having any knowledge on web or design.\nEven though then I took over and I had to change a few things here and there, I think it was very helpful for us as team to have him be dependent on, \"I want to focus on the content.\"\nBut of course, you cannot just write the content on an oceanion page, right?\nYou still have to visualize it to see whether it works or not for a landing page.\nI think it was very good for us that he, he was able to work on that independently, create the basic look and feel, create the content, and then hand it over to me because I have the experience on the on the front end side to polish it and making, making it production ready.\nSo that's one of the extreme of how we use these AI tools, and there is something in between, right?\nI mean, for me, with Flutter, as I said, I usually jump to the chat and say, \"Hey, how can I do this?\nHow can I do this other thing?\"\nI think for Flutter is not as powerful, there is less code around, and for example, let's say React, right?\nSo you can feel it also in the answers it gives, uh, but we also have a web app, not web app, we have the the share page and we have a few web tools, and there I'm less familiar with it, right?\nSo there I'm much more leaning to Cursor or something that is integrated on the IDE to help me.\n\"Hey, how did you create a component in Angular?\"\nRight.\nI forgot about it because I've been working on that for three years.\nSo that's super, super helpful for me, and they are more, yeah, there I have less, let's say, less expertise on what the process is.\nSo I find them much more helpful there.\nSo for me, it's depending on my knowledge of the kind of task that I have, but definitely we are all using it in on developing.\nI think some of us use...\nThat's a cool framework to think through it, actually, because, you know, I think a lot of engineers are struggling right now with figuring out where and when and how to apply these tools because you get pressure from, you know, socially, just like reading LinkedIn or like reading tech blogs and stuff of like, \"Everyone's using all these tools to be like so, like, productive, what should I be doing?\"\nMe, but, you know, it's interesting because you're like, if you know the app super well and you already have that context and you can go in and be really productive and really quickly produce something, then maybe like an AI co-pilot is not as useful because you can just yourself get in there and get it done.\nIf it's something new you're trying to add or something you're not an expert at, it's helping you to kind of get things quickly, and rather than hiring a web engineer or a freelancer or somebody to come in and do that, you can get somebody to move it far enough where then you as a competent engineer can get in and kind of get it the rest of the way.\nAnd so I think that's a good framework because I think sometimes people are like, \"Oh my gosh, do I need to like replace my core expertise with this?\"\nIt's like, no, it's just an, it's an augmentation that helps you get better superpowers, right?\nAnd I think at some point you need this core expertise also to judge what it's giving you, right?\nI mean, it will give you a lot of things, and some things are good, some things are not so good, right?\nAnd some things will work, but some things will work in a way that you know, if you have the expertise, right, on Flutter, I know that this works, but I know the issues it may have, right?\nAnd so I think it's still important to have that so you are the judge, right?\nYou are reviewing what the the AI is outputting.\nOf course, you will test it, but there's much more to code than, I mean, I think as as Kevin said, right, is like an intern.\nYou can give it to an intern.\nHe will give you something that works probably, right?\nWe create a PR, it works, right?\nBut that's why we have peers, right?\nIt's not just that it passed the test.\nLike, \"Okay, how did you code it?\nH, what are the issues that this may introduce or not, right?\"\nSo, you can then guide the AI to to build what you want, how you want it.\nAnd yeah, if you have the expertise, you can guide it much better and maybe you...\n\n\nI need it in less places.\nI'm still personally learning how to use it, right?\nIt's not that I have the answers to these things.\nI mean, it's also like a new tool for me, and in some places, I'm more comfortable using it.\nI mean, in some others, I'm still like, \"Yeah, I don't know.\"\nI mean, I have used it, and it didn't work out that well.\nBut I think I'm still also experimenting on different tools and different ways of how to use it.\nAs you said, I'm also going to delve into LinkedIn, into, I don't know, Hacker News.\nYou get these stories, and you are like, \"Am I missing out?\nIs it good?\nIs it bad?\"\nAnd it's also a little bit, I mean, it gives you a little bit of anxiety, but I think it's good that you...\nI think as developers, we're also afraid that, \"Hey, are we losing our jobs, right?\"\nIt's like, it's like a little bit terrifying, but as you said, it's also an augmentation.\nI think it's much more positive to look at it that way, like, \"Hey, I'm a good developer already, or maybe not, but I think I have, but then I can be even better and can be even faster, and I can maybe delegate the things I don't like or I'm not that good at to the AI and still use my knowledge to be a better developer than someone else that uses the same tool.\"\nRight?\nSo yeah, I think we all still have to figure out where, yeah, what is our workflow?\nI think also before AI, everyone had a different workflow, right?\nNot everyone was programming the same way.\nAnd I think it's the same, right?\nI think it's important to be open to try it and see how it fits in your workflow.\nYeah, I love that.\nI mean, there's so much fear and hype and anxiety and just like chaos out there around this whole change.\nAnd it's really, as you think about it, for us, those of us that have some engineering skill or capability, it's no different than it's ever been in terms of something new comes along and you got to learn it.\nAnd the true expertise is being the engineer of understanding how to use your tools effectively to get your outcome.\nAnd the tools change, and the things that you need to figure out and learn change.\nAnd I think everyone's still just figuring this out.\nYou know, there's like, when you read LinkedIn, it's full of people who proclaim themselves to be experts and wizards and masters of this stuff.\nAnd the truth is, no one's really been doing this that long.\nYou know, like, so there's...\nAnd I always say, like, you guys are one of the apps that actually is on my phone that has core AI features.\nLike, whenever somebody's like, \"Oh my god, are we behind?\nDo I need to shift my career to AI or something like that?\"\nIt's like, \"Okay, think about how many apps you have on your phone where there's an AI feature that is a core element of what you're using right now.\"\nAnd there's just very few still that actually have a lot of, like, you guys are definitely one of them.\nAnd then you have the core ones like ChatGPT or things like that, but you know, we're still so early in this.\nUm, and that's what I think is really interesting about your team.\nUm, and so one of the things I wanted to ask you about was, there's a couple of nuances here, like, you guys have an AI background.\nYou approached this from an AI native approach.\nYou are using actually AI features in your product.\nSo it's not just that you're using AI tools to be more effective in productivity and delivery, but the tool itself is very AI-driven.\nAnd you're a Small Team, you're a startup, you're a small, nimble team.\nAnd I was curious, what kind of like recommendations or insights would you guys have for larger, more established teams based on your experience over the last several years getting this product going?\nLike at VGV, we work with a lot of very large enterprise companies that have big teams, complex internal structures, complex existing code bases.\nAnd one of the things we often want to bring to them, or that they want for themselves, too, is like, \"How do I get that more fast, innovative, sort of quick, small, lean team dynamic that you guys are enjoying right now into my company?\"\nAnd I'm curious what kind of advice you would give to those leaders, uh, to how to infuse some of the things that have worked for you into their cultures.\nLook, at the end of the day, I don't think we have the perfect silver bullet here, but I mean, what I can tell you what I think makes us fast.\nYou know, it's not just because we're a few people, right?\nLike, few people shouldn't make you fast, but what are then actually the characteristics here?\nAnd one of the things is that all four of us understand the product deeply.\nWe understand the user.\nAll of us have, as an example, all of us actually are doing customer support.\nSo each week, it's someone else, uh, who's handling that.\nSo we have direct, like, really the direct connection to the user.\nUh, we all using the app ourselves, and basically, we all have the authority to write and push code, and once you have that, then every single person can act autonomously.\nOf course, it's important to have a direction, right?\nLike, we need to align, and everyone needs to know what is the important thing that we're working on right now, and like, \"This is the big project that we're working on,\" etc.\nBut it's often then the small things, you know, even if we all say, \"Okay, we have project X, this is what we're doing now.\"\nBut there's so many small, little decisions that everyone has to take, and all of that has to go through some kind of, uh, approval process, then you just, you know, you just get slowed down so quickly.\nAnd I believe, just looking at a lot of the, what I hear from colleagues who work at big corporations, this is something where I realize it can never be as fast as if you're just four people, but it seems that there's so many processes in place, especially at older corporations, older companies, that are just actively trying to go in the other direction, basically, like, \"Oh my god, like, no, you can't, you can't push code without, I don't know, having five, ten reviews, and it always has to be like this.\"\nAnd then, yeah, this is a bit from my side, what, what my experience and thought there.\nMaybe one additional one is, definitely, if you work in a small company, like, especially in a startup, it is the success of each single employee is basically equal to the success of the company.\nLike, it's just very difficult to decouple that.\nAnd in large corporations, that's actually often quite different.\nLike, the success of a single individual is more about getting the next promotion or being, um, part of this next, quote unquote, \"cool, big project,\" um, or getting a salary raise.\nAnd all of these things can very easily be completely decorrelated to the actual success of the company.\nUm, so I think that sort of helps in a small company to then run in the same direction.\nYou're totally spot on.\nUm, I love, like, for it's that empowerment thing, you know, and the complexity and the trust, and these big companies build all these systems, and it's hard.\nIt gets really complicated, you know.\nUm, and I think that is ultimately, like, there's so many management books, and you know, all the guests we've had on our podcast here, there, it always comes back to, like, team dynamic and leadership trust, like, does the leadership really trust the team to act and to not be super nitpicky about everything they do and let them do their things that they want?\nAnd communication is the hardest thing, right?\nUh, keeping everybody aligned.\nUm, no, so that's...\nI love that.\nSo I want to, um, thank you guys, this has been really great.\nI want to, I want to wrap us up here, and um, one of the things I just wanted to ask is sort of like a parting shot is, given that you guys have been in AI native land for several years, predating its popularity and the broader sort of zeitgeist, um, what do you think our AI native future really looks like?\nLike, where does this go for Snipd, and where does it go in general for engineers and for knowledge workers and everything else out there?\nWhat do you think?\nSo I think, like, the most important takeaway for me is that I believe all of us still underestimate the impact that AI will have and how much it will change things in that, and that includes myself, because I think it's just so difficult to, for us in general as humans, it's so difficult to understand anything that's sort of exponential or like goes in the direction of an exponential, uh, progress, and that is what we're going through right now with these models.\nSo, I'm actually quite careful always to, like, predict or try to frame myself as knowing what will come and try to go back to, like, um, just remind yourself that you're underestimating it, and then that's already a good approximation.\nBut I can, I mean, I can give you a couple of things, like, one thing that very few people are only talking about, I believe, are AI in the real world, because right now, most of the very public process, I would say, has been happening in the digital realm, basically, all of these LLMs and then with coding, um, and generates generation of images, audio, video, but you can see how these humanoid robot startups are making more and more progress.\nUh, my wife, she works for a company that does autonomous robots, and it's just clear how this will be, this will happen.\nAnd it might be a bit like autonomous driving, right?\nWhere we're like, \"Always three years away, always three years away.\"\nBut you can see what's happening with autonomous, uh, driving now, right?\nI think in the last five months, Whimo has done, um, twice as many rides than in all of the years before, something like that.\nThey have, I don't know, 20% market share in SF for ride hailing, like, it's, you know, it's happening slowly, but then suddenly all at once.\nSo if I can just say one thing, like, maybe real-world AI is something that a lot of people are not talking about yet.\nVery interesting.\nYou have any thoughts?\nYeah, to be honest, I also have no idea how it will change.\nI only know that it will change a lot, and I think it will change a lot for us developers.\nThat's, I mean, maybe where I'm more worried or excited, both at the same time, but I think there it will change a lot.\nAnd I agree with Kevin that we really don't know how much it will change.\nLike, I think we, it will change much more than what we think it will.\nBut I'm trying to, to, to have a positive attitude in the sense, like, trying to get away from, \"I lose my job, I won't be useful.\"\nI want to think that, yeah, we will be able to maybe as developers build much more, much faster and still enjoy it using these tools.\nUh, so that's, that's where, yeah, my hopes and my, my view is.\nAnytime we have these major changes, but there's so many examples of technology over the history of mankind, like, just having these radical shifts that change workforce, and you know, honestly, it's a little bit disappointing and disturbing to me that people feel like, \"Oh, because of AI, suddenly there's just going to be like all this unemployment,\" and like, I'm like, \"I feel like it's not really giving all of those people a fair shake.\"\nIt's like, you think that there something's going to change here, and they're just going to like say, \"Well, shucks, I lost my job.\nUm, you know, I'm not going to...\"\nThey're people are crafty.\nWe're, we have ingenuity.\nWe figure new things out to do.\nAnd realistically, what I've always said felt about AI and some of these tools, these code assistants and things like that, it's like, really, it's the same thing that Flutter did for us, right?\nIt's like, it's giving our developers more productivity, more superpower, more better developer experience.\nAnd I think all the tools that people are worried about AI, \"Oh, AI is going to come and replace my job.\"\nNo, it's not.\nIt's just going to make your job better, and you just have to take it upon yourself to graduate to more interesting things that you can do with your time.\nUm, and I think that's the exciting part, actually.\nI mean, from our side, um, if there's any developer listening and is afraid that they will lose their job, I mean, I can only say that, you know, we try to use AI as much as we can in our coding, and we, we have enough things to code for at least ten more developers easily, like, there's, there's always something we have, we have such a long list of ideas, like, I think the, the, you know, the what's it called, Jevons paradox or something like that, I forgot the name.\nI think, I think this is so true, like, basically, a good become cheaper or, or, yeah, basically becomes cheaper, then the demand for it actually goes up, and it goes up by much more than the, the quote unquote, \"price\" uh, decrease, and I think software is one of these things where that that will that will happen.\nThat's a great thing to end on, positive note.\nI think we have to be optimists, right?\nAnd we have to look at this as the opportunity and the excitement for what's ahead.\nThere's so much doom and gloom.\nIt's a little bit, you know, it's unfortunate.\nWe got to stay focused on this is going to make everything so much better in the long run.\nAnd, um, so I thank you guys for coming on here.\nThank you for making Snipd.\nIt's a really awesome tool.\nUm, really cool to see that connected from your personal observation and need and and your own passions and then leveraging the latest and greatest tools to make something people enjoy using and makes a difference.\nSo thanks so much for coming on, telling your story.\nYeah, thanks for having us.\nYeah, thanks for having us.\nThank you for joining us on Build to Succeed, a Very Good Ventures podcast.\nWe hope you enjoy exploring the experiences and insights of leaders that have built successful digital products.\nPlease take a moment to leave us a review and don't forget to
