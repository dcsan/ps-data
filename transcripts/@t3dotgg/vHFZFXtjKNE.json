  "cleanText": "Hot take. Using shadcn/ui, Radix is a\nliability at this point. Either Work OS\nneeds to find more people to maintain it,\nor the ecosystem should unite around\nArya. Oh boy, what a big drama. As you\nguys can guess, I have a ton of thoughts\nand sources on this. There's a lot to go\ninto here. Shadcn/ui is a phenomenal set of\ncomponents that I've been recommending\nfor a long time. I still love them. I\nstill think you should use them. But\nthere is a real concern here that Chris\nbrings up. And Chris, your CJE is a\ntrusted friend, contributor,\ncollaborator deep in all of the things\nthat I talk about and touch here. He's\none of the most important contributors\nto create T3 app and has just generally\nbeen a really good friend and person to\nhave in the space. So for him to come\nout and say something this bold is\nimportant and definitely needs us to\ntalk about it. We're not just going to\ncover what he said. We're also going to\ncover the other proposals people made,\nother libraries that they recommend, and\nmost importantly, Shadcn himself's\nresponse to all of this. There's a ton\nto dig into here. I can't wait to do it,\nbut someone has to pay the bills, and it\nprobably shouldn't be Work OS today. So,\na quick word from today's sponsor and\nthen we'll dive in. I still remember\nwhen I got started with webdev, it was\nreally hard to make good UIs because CSS\nwas super difficult. Since then,\nTailwind happened, and now CSS isn't\nhard, but finding the right inspiration\nis. Now, we have these AIs that you can\nhand a screenshot and they'll perfectly\nrecreate it with Tailwind. But where do\nyou get the right screenshot? Where do\nyou find the right inspiration? Finding\nthe right starting point is often the\nhardest part of making a great user\nexperience. And that's why today's\nsponsor has come in clutch for me. Mobbin\nis where I go when I need inspiration\nfor making something look good because\nthey have this insane collection with\nover 400,000 screens from real\napplications that you probably use\nyourself. So, if you're trying to make\nsomething like, I don't know, a signup\npage for iOS, now we have all these\ndifferent options. You can break it down\nby categories. So, let's see how crypto\ncompanies handle their signup pages. Or\ncompare that with how developer tools do\nit instead. Here, we can see how Linear\nhandles signup on iOS. They do it\nthrough a web view, which is kind of\nfunny. If we switch to web, we can see\nmany more different options for\ndifferent developer tools. If you like\none, you can just click command C. Now\nthe image is in your clipboard. Hop over\nto your AI tool of choice, be it your\nIDE like cursor or something like V\n0ero. Paste it in. Say make it look like\nthis, but make these changes. And it\nwill just generate the thing you're\nlooking for. Make a sign up page that\nlooks like this for my service named T3\nchat. Use purple as the main accent\ncolor. Make it dark mode 2. And now Bolt\nis just generating a UI based on the\nscreenshot that I found. And look at\nthat. With no effort at all, we now have\na beautiful sign up page for our\napplication. I've been using this a ton\nsince I got started with it, and I think\nyou will as well. For 10 bucks a month,\nit's a steal. Check them out today at\nsoyv.link/mobbin.\nI think it's important that we\nunderstand what both shadcn/ui is as\nwell as Radix. Before we go any further,\nI've covered Shadcn a bunch. I've\ncovered Radix a bit. I have my famous\ndiagram of the types of UI libraries.\nAnd the reason I like Shadcn/ui is part\nof all of that. This is the diagram that\nI've drawn in the past. I try to break\nup style libraries into these three\npieces. There's CSS++, which is better\nways to write the CSS part, the styles\ndirectly. Something like Tailwind is a\ngood example of that. Headless behaviors\nare things like how the dropdown\nbehaves, how focus is managed, how\nthings work between the JavaScript, the\nstyles and the page, but mostly the\nJavaScript and focus management side.\nAnd Radix is a great example of that.\nAnd then styles themselves, like the\nthing that makes it look the way it\nlooks, like the actual CSS directly, not\nthe syntax for it, but the CSS itself,\nespecially opinionated things like\nBootstrap or material UI, those are how\nit's supposed to look. The the classic\nheadless, boneless, and skinless UI that\nI've covered in the past, one of my\nfavorite videos I've done. The thing I\ntouch on a lot because it's an important\nconcept to understand is the\nrelationship between these things. I put\nShadcn/ui in the middle because it's a\nunique thing where it comes with\nTailwind for the styling and CSS side.\nIt comes with Radix for how the\nbehaviors work, and it has the styles\nwhich they wrote themselves for how it\nlooks. So it looks the way it does.\nTraditionally I haven't liked things\nthat combine all the parts because now\nyou've given up ownership of them. But\nthe thing that makes Shadcn/ui different as\na component library is it gives you the\nsource code. When you run the Shadcn/ui\ncommands, it doesn't add the package to\nyour code base. It adds the code to your\ncodebase. That code happens to rely on\npackages sometimes like it relies on\nTailwind in order to add the CSS. Relies\non Radix for a lot of the different\nbehaviors. It also relies on things like\nSonner for their toasts and other\nlibraries like that. But Radix is\nwithout question one of the most key\npieces to the Shadcn/ui ecosystem. So\nRadix has since been split. When the\nRadix team was trying to make more\nmoney and also give you more styles,\nthey created Radix UI, which is Radix\nthemes so that you can have things that\nlook a certain way that they had built\nand designed for you. But Radix is\nmostly known for Radix primitives.\nThese are the pieces like the dialogue,\nthe drop down menu, popovers, things\nlike that. And if we go to the docs for\nthese, you'll see that they are\nrelatively minimal.\nWe get the code for the accordion\naccordion root item yada yada. We have\nthese components and also hooks that\nthey provide, but they don't make it\nlook any way. You have to bring the\nstyles yourself. As we see here, this is\nexample styles they wrote to show it\noff. That includes everything you need\nfor it to look a certain way, animate\nproperly, all of that. But the behaviors\nis what they do. The fact that the\naccordion can have things open and\nclose, and that it works with like\nkeyboard navigation, enter key does what\nit's supposed to. All of those details\nare what Radix brings for you. Radix is\na really good library for doing a lot of\nthese things. It's gotten a lot of love\nover the years. Radix was originally\nbuilt at the startup modules that has\nsince went defunct. It was also built\nalongside some other cool things like\nstitches which was really useful library\nearly on for managing like CSS andJS\nstuff. The Radix team continued to\nmaintain the Radix open source project\neventually putting out themes as an\nattempt to make more money and offer\nmore in the Radix ecosystem. And then\nWork OS acquired the team. Work OS\nacquiring the Radix team and project\nactually made a lot of sense in my\nopinion. Obviously account for bias\nbecause Work OS is one of our sponsors,\nbut I was chatting with them way before\nthey were ever even considering\nsponsoring the channel about this\nbecause we wanted to make sure this was\na good alignment and that this made\nsense and I thought it did. Work OS\nneeded much better component libraries\nand integrations for bringing O into\nyour React applications, and these guys\nwere some of the industry leaders in\ndoing that. Well, there's a reason Work\nOS is as popular as they are and is used\nby half the companies we talk about\nnowadays. They're a really good off\nplatform. Radix was brought on to make\nOFKit. Offkit is their generic component\nlibrary to add signin, TUFA, all the\ndifferent things you would need to do\noff properly for your product. And it\nsays powered by Work OS. Obviously, it\nworks great with Work OS, but could be\nused with other things as well. So, it\nhad to be a generic component system for\ndoing off right. really cool project.\nPumped that they did this. That said, it\nwas limited scope and the work that the\nRadix team had cut out for them was\ncompleted relatively quick. And since\nthen, a lot of those Radix maintainers\nhave left to do different new things,\nincluding base UI created by the\ncreators of Radix, floating UI and\nmaterial UI coming together. Base UI is\nquickly becoming the new similar way of\ndoing this. You'll see the syntax looks\npretty familiar. It looks nearly\nidentical depending on the component of\ncourse. This seems to be the direction a\nlot of things are moving in. But it's\nalso yet another project starting from\nscratch from a company that needs to\nfind a way to make money that isn't\ndirectly this. And it is being very well\nmaintained. As we see here 8 hours ago,\nwe're still getting commits. We hop over\nto insights. We can see there's a lot of\ncode still coming in to this library. It\nis still relatively new, kind of, but\nwork really picked up in 2024. And now\nthis project is moving. As you can see\nhere, contributions pretty steady and if\nanything going up a bit. December was\nwild. They shipped a lot then\napparently. Pretty cool. So what we've\nestablished so far, Radix was a really\ngood solution for component-based\nheadless UI management for our React\napplications. If you were building your\nown component library for your project\nor business or whatever, there's a very\ngood chance Radix is the thing you\npicked. Your options would have been\nRadix, Arya Kit. You could have went\nlike and built on top of the old\nmaterial UI. It would have been very\nrough though. React Arya's a really good\none as well, but you would probably pick\nbetween one of these solutions as well\nas a couple others that I'm certainly\nforgetting about right now to build your\ncomponent library on top of. React area\nis by Adobe and it's very well\nmaintained because Adobe makes it. Arya\nkit is really really cool as well. Diego\nis working on it if I recall largely\nsolo like does the majority of the work\nhimself. Even now he is the most recent\ncommit. If we look in contributors,\nyeah, this is Diego slaving over it. And\nRenovate bot seems to be doing pretty\nwell, too. But Diego is working his ass\noff to make Arya Kit really, really\ngood. But remember that the concern we\nhave right now with Radix is that it's\nmaintainers aren't as involved anymore.\nThe bus factor for something like Arya\nKit is pretty large because it's largely\none dude. If Diego loses interest or\ngets hurt or sick or something, the\nproject stops moving. And you can see\nhere when he had dips because sure\nthings were going on. He has more than\nreasonable reasons to have a couple\nmonths where he's just not contributing\nas much. That means the whole project\nslows in those times. So let's go take a\nlook at the pulse erratics. There were\nalready a lot of dead areas, but now it\nseems to have pretty much stopped.\nChance here, good friend at homie, very\nhard worker, has been pulled in at Work\nOS largely to focus on helping maintain\nthis because it needs the maintenance.\nBut a lot of the OGs like Bonito and\nJensen have fully stopped contributing\nand poor Chance has had to come in and\ntake over from there. Jensen, by the\nway, is one of like the smartest humans\nI know. She's incredible. So yeah,\nscary. This is not a contributor chart\nthat gives me a lot of faith in a\nproject. I see why people would be\nconcerned, especially when you see the\n549 issues that are open and the 104\npoll requests that are open, too. Colem,\nwho's the original creator of Radix,\nhas had the following to say. It's cool\nto see so many of you recommending base\nUI in the thread. For what it's worth, I\nagree that Radix is a liability. Of all\nthe headless UI libs, it's the last\noption I'd consider for any serious\nproject, says the guy who co-created it.\nI think that says a lot. Seems like some\namount he is burned by the acquisition\nfrom Work OS. He feels betrayed some\namount. Understandable watching your\nopen source project go to a company and\nslowly lose maintenance and control.\nIt's a bad feeling. I would understand\nwhy he'd be so upset. He's also said\nthat he worked hard to make sure that\nbase UI would be a relatively easy thing\nfor people to migrate to. We designed\nbase UI for an easy migration path from\nRadix. I'm not a fan of dunking on\nlibraries either, especially ones I\nhelped to create. What I care most about\nis helping companies to build UI\neffectively and ensuring accessibility\non the web. So I'm happy to steer people\nin the right direction with those goals\nin mind. Let's timeline this a little to\nmake it make a bit more sense. So Radix\nis created at modules to make it easier\nto build good component libraries. It\nbecomes more and more popular and\neventually becomes the most popular\nlargely because shadcn/ui adopts Radix in\ntheir example component library that is\nnow what we know as shadcn/ui. Straight up\nhalf or more of these AI app builder\nthings are using shadcn/ui, which means in\nturn they are using a lot of Radix.\nShadcn/ui is more than Radix. Some people\nwould argue that Shadcn/ui is just a Radix\nwrapper. I would argue it's not. If you\nlook at the code from shadcn/ui, the\ncomponents that you're installing there,\nthere isn't too much Radix in it. There\nis like like there are Radix things\ntouching a lot of the components, but\nit's like eight lines of code, and they\ncould almost certainly be replaced with\nsomething like base UI. So where did the\nproblems come? Well, after this, Work OS\nrequires Radix team, which also came\nafter modules ended. The Work OS\nrequires the Radix team to help with a\nlot of things. They both want to like\ncontinue maintaining Radix, cuz I'm sure\nthey are using it, but they also want to\nhave the Radix team work on things like\nOffkit, which was the first major thing\nthey built when they joined, and slowly\nRadix folks leave Work OS and with it\nstopped contributing. Remember in\nparallel more and more people are\nadopting Shadcn/ui. That includes the\ncompany Axiom, which a bunch of my\nchatters and community folks work at,\nincluding Igor here, including Gabriel\nwho is one of the most helpful people in\nthe whole community. Also including CJE\nwho started a lot of this. Here they\nare. Axiom was one of my first sponsors\nand they're one of my favorite\ncompanies. They built a crazy platform\nfor handling absurd amounts of data\ningest and logging. Almost all of our\nlog, I'd say not almost, literally all of\nour logs go through Axiom. They can\nhandle terabytes of data for like no\nmoney. It's kind of absurd. But in order\nto handle these absurd amounts of data,\nthey have\n\n\nTo make a UI that is performant enough to deal with millions of rows rendering. CJ actually gave a great talk about all the weird things you have to do in order to handle rendering millions of a thing in a browser. This is their playground where you can play around with things. And you can see just the like sheer amount of data that you can push through it with no issue. And it like the site flies. It's actually absurd how easy it is to hop into a stream that has 2.97 terabytes of data. This is all of the posts for Blue Sky and you can like scroll through it, add filters and search and it works. They've put a lot of work into rendering absurd amounts of data in a really performant UI at scales that are hard to comprehend. It's insane. Yeah, it's literally all of the events from the blue sky fire hose and they just ingest it no problem because that's what Axiom does. They're insane.\n\nSo, of course, CJ is one of the leads on the front end side there cares a lot about performance and optimizing every single edge they can in order to make it work well. They use Radix UI because they use Shadcn and also build their own stuff internally. I know that Agor has put a lot of time into building their own perfect component library, but they run into this issue a lot where there is an update depth being exceeded because the Radix library would call set state internally too aggressively on certain cases. The thing that's scary about this issue is that it was closed without being fixed early last year and it is still a problem because they have use effects without dependency arrays. Like the biggest no no, don't do this in React. They do. There's no DEP array here. So, this reruns constantly and now you have effects triggering all of the time and things as simple as the popover package that they provide. That is terrifying. Running into this issue when you have 50 plus tool tips on the same page. Yeah, not even the tool tips showing, just the tool tips exist. Apparently for this particular issue, there is now a fix because again, Chance is finally working on it. Going to try and get this squeezed in before the next release. That is good to see. Thank you, Agor, for reporting this to them and getting it raised. Hopefully going forward this one as well as others will be fixed. These things are very common in Radix now at like the scales people are using it and shipping it at. Yeah, there's Ollie. Most of our teams left and Chance is the one who's maintaining now. Very least if that this issue should be reopened. Yeah, very big deal. Good call out, Ollie.\n\nSo, more and more CJ is seeing these things as they try to make the UI performant at Axiom and came out to blow the whistle on how absurd it is because a lot of people don't see this. There's a lot of people who are just going to start getting these errors in their React apps as they get bigger, have no idea why, and try to vibe code their way out of it and fail. Thankfully, Chance is awesome. As all of the Axiom guys are now saying, there's a good chance he can help at least stop the bleeding at the very, very least. So, now we have a rough timeline of how we got here, why it's so bad, and why the thing isn't being maintained as well. Thankfully, Work OS is putting the money in to make sure someone is skilled this chance. It's like one of the original like Remix guys, one of the most legendary devs in the history of the React web world. One of the few who can actually fix these problems. very thankful he's the one who's been pulled in to work on it, but it's still a liability. We should still be scared and we should definitely take a look at what Shadcn himself had to say.\n\nWe're at the point in the web dev cycle where we're talking about component libraries again. That's okay. With Radix receiving fewer updates, it's a conversation that's worth having. Love this open. Shad CN did kind of end the like constant wars about different style solutions and UI libraries. It was nice cuz I I felt like I had to talk about that stuff a lot before and Shadcn just kind of ended it which was great. It's also worth noting that on some hand Radix is kind of done in terms of like the features and things they intend to add and that's a big part of why it's no longer being maintained as actively because there aren't things that need to be added and done to it. There are maintenance things and lasting bugs that have been sitting there that should be addressed. But at some point a piece of software needs to be considered done or at the very least like feature complete. Apparently, they're still adding new components. I did not know that. There's a lot of components left. Noted. These guys, who I trust more than my own takes, say that there needs to be new things. I trust them. And also, Nean, the creator of Stylex, one of the other style CSS world gods, says that there needs to be a successor. All really good points. I'm thankful I have you guys here to keep me on point with this coverage.\n\nBack to Shad's take. Let me start with this and I'll bold it. The worst thing you can do now for your production app is switch component libraries. Don't do it. That's not where your time or resources should go. Whatever bug you're seeing with Radix in your app, you'll likely run into more, including new ones, with something else. No shade to anyone. That's just how code works. I agree with all of this. You're always trading one set of bugs for another, but you also need a way to solve the bugs when you hit them. And if Radix's code isn't being maintained well enough to fix those, it's at the very least time for a a fork of Radix or a solution for new things going forward to be built on top of. Shadian says, \"Yes, Radix is getting fewer updates, but it's still a mature and well-designed library, battle tested and used in millions of production apps. Code doesn't stop working just because maintainers move on.\" Absolutely agree. That's the strength of open source and what Radix does, it still does extremely well. So here's what he suggests. Already using Radix in production? Stick with it. Starting a new project? Consider Radix, React Arya or Arya Kit. All great choices. Using Radix and thinking about what's next? Keep an eye on base UI. We are this. I'm almost certain there's a near future where Shadcn starts to move things over to base UI. Not going to be fun cuz again remember all the code lives in your repo, but they'll probably do a code mod or some fancy AI stuff to help you port it all over.\n\nGreat comment from chat. UI library maintenance is a form of psychological torture. I couldn't agree harder. It's bad. As Shad says here, base UI is built by the same smart team that created Radix. They've done it once, now they get to do it again, and it's looking really good. Also of note is that it is currently in beta. If your solution to Radix having a couple bugs in the very well established existing library is to move to a beta, like going from an established thing like Radix with a few bugs to a beta. If your goal is to avoid bugs, the good luck. Also, if you hit a bug with Radix and you can't find a fix or patch, try testing the equivalent from base UI. The API is very similar. Again, the code lives in your repo. If you install a Shadcn component, you can change it. We've done this a bunch. We've made all of our Shadcn stuff super customized for our use cases in T3 chat. If we have these types of performance issues, we will absolutely start moving parts of our Shadcn usage over to use Base UI instead of Radix. And as Shad says, Shadcn is built for this. It's code you own, code you can improve, rewrite, or replace. Most important thing, use something that works for you and that you understand. Your component library should be stable. This isn't where you want to take risks in your tech stack.\n\nBars. I am so tired of people betting on super experimental stuff for things that don't need it. And your component library is absolutely one of those. A good component library is forgotten about once you set it up because it's doing what it needs to and you can move on. Makes sense. And the solution that Axiom has now, if you're curious, is they are git patching the dependencies. Ah, painful, but checks out. Every new project, not just component libraries, goes through growing pains. Bugs, API changes, missing features, incomplete docs. It's okay to wait it out, especially for production apps. But where does Shadcn UI fit into all of this? Shadcn's unfortunately named and it's also not a component library. It's an idea. It's a combination of a few things. An open abstraction, great defaults in a distribution system. An open abstraction built on top of several component libraries. Radix is one of them. It's also by far the one that's used the most. It's code you'd write yourself structured in a way that's easy to work with and it's also loved by LLMs. Part two is the carefully chosen defaults. things like focus states, animation styles, variants, components that fit within the system with one another as well. Just enough to be a good starting point and enough to get out of the way so when you're ready to build your own design system, you can build it on top. And the distribution system, which is one of the coolest parts that you can call the Shadcn CLI and add a component and it will add the code to your codebase. The component library is just one layer of Shadcn. If it ever comes to it, it is a swappable one. This is part of what makes Shadcn such a good bet.\n\nSo to go back the original post using shaden/radics is a liability kind of for radics. I can absolutely see the argument here. I'd even share it myself. Radix is not as well maintained as it should be considering how prominent it is. I am thankful chance is at work OS. It is getting things moving again. But it is still undetermined as to how far it will go. How long will Chance stay there? Because if Chance again bus factor or decides to leave, what happens to Radix then? If this was a deep core part of another abstracted package, I'd be more concerned. But since Shadcn's whole thing is that you install the code and that it is a modular set of things, this works well. It's similar to why I made the T3 stack. The goal was that each of these pieces is modular and we can swap them out as new things make sense. Don't want TRPC? Swap it with OPC or swap it with server components or swap it with just traditional REST API endpoints. Don't like Tailwind? I'm confused. But there's lots of other options there, too. Don't like Prisma? You can use Drizzle. There's lots of different options for all the parts. That's why I built it that way. Each piece isn't part of the framework. Each piece is just that, a piece that's modular that you can swap two different things for. Shadcn is in a phenomenal position to swap these both as part of the official libraries but also as a script or a CLI that we can run to move things over to use radics instead because it's just code. The code is modular. You own it in your codebase and you can make these changes if you want to and they can recommend these changes if they decide to. The reason shaden is even in this post is because the majority of new radics usage is coming from people using shaden. Nobody's going and manually installing Radix and setting it up today. Some people probably are, but a very small percentage in comparison to the number of people who are using Shadcn through it instead. Think that covers everything here. Honestly, not that big of a show considering how significant the impact is here. I feel like the conversation that came out of this was actually really good and it was a solid opportunity for us to all learn about how to think about UI libraries, how to maintain these big code bases, and how to make sure we do the right thing both for our dev teams and for our users. The future is still bright. Where the future will be is always hard to know, but I'm thankful we have such a good set of people maintaining these tools and solutions. And even if Radix has not been as well maintained for a bit now, that might change. It's looking like it is changing and we have plenty of other options if it doesn't change going forward. I feel good about where the web is. I'm curious how y'all feel.\n",
