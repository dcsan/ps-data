  "cleanText": "Product leadership is the type of role where if you are not in control of the voices in your head, they will eat you alive. You spend a lot of time thinking about how to help your team learn to take a punch. If they come to me and they're upset, I try to focus them less around how you litigate another person's impression of you and more on what is the action that you can take to counterprogram the narrative that you are afraid that this other person has of you. What are you going to do next to demonstrate that you are the person that you know yourself to be? You have specific tactics that you teach your team to deal with hardship. I would really love it if more people were like, \"Screw it. I'm going to do something that's probably going to fail. It's important and it's worth doing and I'm going to do it well.\" Is there something you've learned about when your leader tells you to do something you disagree with? People think that the game is all about influencing the CEO, influencing the people around them. You come up thinking like you're the protagonist, but in the story of work, you are probably not the protagonist. You're not special.\n\nToday, my guest is Hilary Gridley. Hilary is head of core product at WHOOP. Previously, she was a senior director of product at Big Health and a senior product marketing manager at Dropbox. Even more importantly, she wrote what is now the sixth most popular post of all time in my newsletter, How to Become a Super Manager with AI. She's also the first ever crossover guest between this podcast and her sister podcast, How I AI with Claire Vo. And not just that, her episode with Claire is on track to be the most popular episode of the podcast. So, all that to say, Hillary is incredible, and I'm so excited to continue learning from her. This conversation is packed with advice that will make you a better product leader, builder, and also just a better human. If you know it's good for you, you don't want to miss this episode.

I talked to a bunch of people that I work with you about what we should talk about and what you're amazing at. Uh, first of all, every one of them loves working with you so much. One of them is like I joined WHOOP just to work with Hillary meant to report to her and of that a theme there's kind of this theme that emerged that I think is a good kind of overarching theme for our conversation and it's something that you spend a lot of time thinking about and it's how to help your team and how to help people within your company learn to take a punch essentially how to help them deal with hard stuff and do hard stuff and build hard things. So I guess just broadly does that ring a bell? Does that resonate?\nYeah, absolutely. It's uh it's something I care a lot about. I've been I think pretty lucky in my career. I've been very drawn to working on hard product problems, uh regulated areas, uh really hard business models, uh things with pretty high emotional stakes for the users of the products. Um you're really likely to run into a lot of setbacks along the way. And I think this is really relevant today because I look out and I I talk to a lot of people and I hear fear and I hear uncertainty and I think it comes from a few places. I think um obviously I'm really excited about AI and how it's transforming the way we work and I think a lot of people are but I think a lot of people are scared too and they're embracing these tools. They're learning these tools but a lot of them have a question in the back of their mind like what does this mean for the future of my job? And in many cases, what does this mean for for my identity, right? Like I think it it makes people question um even just how we provide value as humans in society. And I also think, you know, people, especially young people today, haven't even necessarily been in a career environment where there wasn't always kind of a threat of layoffs or things like that. And I think that's taken a real psychic toll on a lot of people. And so I think all managers now really need to be able to lead their teams through uncertainty, through fear, through hard things. Um, and I love the concept of taking a punch. I've got a couple other tools that I I like to use. Um, but I think it it can teach people how to thrive in these environments. And it's really important to me because I would love if more people took on hard things. I think there's so many really hard challenging problems out there to solve. And the more people are kind of fearful about the future of their careers or the future of work, I think the more they gravitate toward things that they feel like they're likely to succeed at. And I think that's wonderful. We need that, too. Uh but I would really love it if if more people were like, \"Screw it. I'm going to do something that's probably going to fail.\" And uh it's important and it's worth doing and I'm going to do it well.\nThere's so many kind of end diagrams of why this skill is so important, especially today. One is it feels like the easy stuff is is done. like the stuff left to build is hard. Like it feels like hardware, deep tech is where things are heading. Also, just like machine learning, AI skills, just like stuff that's really hard. And then the other is just AI is just changing so much. It's just such a stressful time and hard time for a lot of people. Let's actually walk through some of the things that you have learned about how to help people get good at these things, about how to learn, how to help people learn to take a punch, uh aka do hard things, deal with struggle. The first is you actually actively teach them like you have specific tactics that you teach your team to deal with hardship and to take a punch. So what are some of those things? What are some of the things that you teach your team and help them develop the skill?\nUh so at its core when I say take a punch, what I mean is you're going to run into situations where something has gone wrong. Uh maybe you have misstepped, maybe you are just hearing someone speak critically about your work, whatever it might it might be. You're going to feel like you have taken a punch. like it's a very physical feeling. And I think as managers, you spend a lot of time teaching your team how to be successful, right? You you want to prepare them to maximize the chances of a good outcome. But if you don't also prepare them for what happens when that outcome isn't as good, uh you're going to run into some problems. And so when I think about how to take a punch, what I say to my team is if they come to me and they're upset because something has happened, uh maybe they said something in a meeting that wasn't received well or again they're hearing somebody else talk about them in some way. Whatever it is, I try to focus them less around whatever happened and how you litigate another person's impression of you based on something that has already happened and more on what is the action that you can take next to counterprogram the narrative that you are afraid that this other person has of you. And I think the counterprogram piece is really important because whenever we feel our ego's injured, I think it's very natural for all of us to say like, well, that's not fair. I want to correct the record. When you do that, I I think more than often more often than not, you come off as as just looking defensive, and you kind of start obsessing over things that you don't actually have control over, uh, which is what another person thinks of you, and you don't even necessarily have that information. And so, I always ask myself in these moments, what is one thing that I can do, small, that will demonstrate the opposite of what I'm afraid this person thinks of me? And so, I'll give you an example of this. Um, I was in a meeting a while ago and we were talking about different things that we wanted to start tracking in the WHOOP Journal and our chief technology officer suggested ketamine tracking and I thought she was making a joke and I laughed and she looked at me very seriously and was like, \"This isn't funny, Hillary.\" Like, this is a serious issue for a lot of people. uh and it's it's an emerging uh problem in some cases and I think we should take it seriously and I think there's a lot of value we could provide here and I was completely humiliated uh humiliated because I actually take this stuff really seriously like I take addiction really seriously. I have a ton of empathy for for people who struggle with it. And I also think of myself as somebody who embraces new ideas and wants to be on the forefront and uh wouldn't ever laugh off something that kind of seems like a fringe issue that's I think becoming actually more and more uh a big part of what's happening today. And so I realized that in that moment I was having that reaction because of the the feeling that it gave me about who I am as a person. And I became so worried that this other person had the wrong impression of me. And I wanted to follow up with her after and say like, \"Let me explain myself. Like, let me explain why I didn't mean that or whatever it is.\" But I just, as I said, I think I think usually that you're fighting a losing battle when you're trying to do that. And it draws attention to the thing that you kind of did poorly. Uh, and you don't really want to draw more attention to it, right? You want to move on, take action, move forward. And so I thought about, well, what what am I afraid that she thinks of me? I'm afraid that she thinks that maybe I don't take uh some of these health issues seriously. I'm afraid she thinks that maybe I'm somebody who uh kind of like laughs off emerging trends. Um and so I thought about what's something that I could do to demonstrate the opposite of that. And I did some research very very quickly on um you know what are some like emerging public health concerns that people really aren't talking about that would be interesting to track. And I found some interesting research about sports betting and especially young people in sports betting and it's sort of becoming this thing that a lot of public health experts are very worried about. And so I very quickly just sent her a note that said wanted to build on this idea you had today. Um I really liked that idea by the way I you know I saw this this article or this research about this other emerging thing sports betting and I think it'd be really interesting for us to start tracking that because we could maybe draw some correlations between people's stress. We have stress monitor and WHOOP. We can track your stress. Uh we could draw interesting correlations between vetting behaviors and stress levels. Um and so that's all I did. It took me 5 10 minutes total. Um but I think it it's a great example of show of showing this idea of like counterprogram that narrative. Don't don't fight about the narrative. And so when I teach this to my team, I'm always doing the same thing. They come to me uh they seem kind of agitated about something and I say to them like it seems like this is really bothering you. What what's going on in your head? What are you afraid of? What are you worried about? And often it will emerge, you know, I'm worried that this other person thinks I'm bad at my job. I'm worried that this person thinks I'm an idiot. Whatever it is. And I challenge that. I think this is really important for managers, too, to kind of challenge this negative thinking when you see it happen and not just sort of validate it and allow them to go down these negative spirals. I challenge it and I say, first of all, I don't I don't think there's evidence for that. Is there evidence for that? And you know, even if there is, it doesn't really matter.\nwhat's what's something that you could do to show them that it's not true because you know it's not true.\n\n\nI think giving people that power to\nfocus on the next step they can take and\nthe action that they can take that helps\nthem feel more secure in their identity\nand who they are because their action\ndemonstrates that. It just gets them\nout of that negative thinking and it\ngets them through that trough of despair\nthat comes after you feel like you took\na punch. So the idea here is when\nyou're afraid somebody that matters in\nyour career thinks ill of you of\nsomething that you did or you're not\ngood at something or you think something\nthat they're not happy about. Like this\nis a version of getting punched\nbasically is you just feeling like\nsomeone thinks you're not doing a great\njob. And so the tactic here is how to\nchange their mind almost about you and\ngive you something tangible to do. Yeah.\nOkay. And so the question to ask, and I\nwrote this down as you were talking, is\nthis is what you ask of your reports.\nWhat is the one thing that you can do\nthat demonstrates the opposite of what\nyou think this person thinks about you?\nExactly. And it's this comes up all the\ntime. There will be narratives that\nemerge, some are good, some are bad,\nabout you and your career. I think\nespecially when people get to a place\nwhere they're putting themselves out\nthere more, right? They're talking in\nmore presentations, they're talking in\nmore meetings. It's very natural for\nthem to become concerned with the\nperception of themselves, and it is scary\nbecause it feels like something as I\nsaid you don't have control over. And\nso, exactly if it's if instead of\nfocusing people around what do these\npeople think of me, you focus them\naround, well, what are you going to do\nnext to demonstrate that you are the\nperson that you know yourself to be?\nI think that can just be incredibly\neffective at giving people more of a\nsense of agency. I guess talk about the\nbalance of I'm just gonna prove everyone\nwrong against what they think versus\nhere's who I am and I know this is me\nand this person is mistaken and instead\nof debating them, I'm going to show them\nwho I am. Just like not overstressing\nabout everyone thinking things about you\nin different ways. There is some value,\nI think, in having a little bit of a\nchip on your shoulder. I think that\nthat's definitely been. You see that\npeople who are really successful, they\ndo have a little bit of like I'm going\nto prove them wrong. And so I don't want\nto say that you shouldn't think about it\nat all or you shouldn't care. Like of\ncourse it's natural to care and of\ncourse it's fine to care, but I do\nwant to just sort of help my team\nbuild this habit of doing the things\nthat you know to be right and and having\nconviction in that and you know being\nopen to learning along the way and and\nsort of calibrating as you go. But not\nbecoming overly concerned with\nyour fears of what other people are\ngoing to think of you because I think\nespecially for otherwise really\nthoughtful, you know, really kind of the\npeople who are kind of hard on\nthemselves. I think that that just holds\nthem back from being the person that\nthey can be. So, a key part of this is\nthis is going to help you stop just\nspiraling on thinking about what they\nthink about you and gives you something\nto do that will change that. And then\nthe other key point here is don't try to\nconvince them otherwise. You're not\ngoing to go to your manager like, \"Oh,\nI'm I really think ketamine therapy and\naddiction is really important and I'm I\ndidn't mean to say it this way.\" And\nthat kind of thing. I, you know, I'm not\ninterested in litigating the things that\nhappened already when we can move\nforward. And I'm certainly not\ninterested in litigating what another\nperson thinks about a thing that\nhappened. I just I feel like I've\nspent so much time talking to people in\nmeetings, whatever it is, where it's\njust this kind of like ruminating on\nsomething that has already happened.\nYou know, it's very like anxious\nthinking pattern, I think. And people\ncan just get stuck in it. And so, you\nknow, let them let them do it. Like\nI often think about it's like when\nyou get bad feedback, right? Or\ncritical feedback and you kind of\nnaturally have this reaction of oh well\nyou know that's not fair because they\ndon't understand I actually have numbers\nI have to deliver on or like I only had\n10 minutes to do this so like of course\nit wasn't perfect. Like you you naturally\ncome up with these reasons why you're\nactually not wrong.\nAnd that's fine. Like it's I don't\nwant to say like you should feel bad for\ndoing that. Let yourself have the\npity party. Let yourself feel those\nthings, but then but then you got to\nmove on as quickly as possible because\nthose feelings, they actually do tend to\nspiral and get worse if you're not\nactively working against them. Often\ntimes these sorts of lessons come from\nthe person experiencing this themselves.\nIs this something that you dealt with\nwhen you were starting your career or\neven now? And Oh, absolutely. 100%.\nAnd I think it is more than just my\ncareer, but just my like general mental\nhealth and my life. A lot of where this\ncomes from is a concept in\ncognitive behavioral therapy called\nbehavioral activation. And in my former\njob, I was working for a company called\nBig Health, and I was we make digital\ntherapeutics. So those are mobile apps\nthat have been clinically validated to\ntreat behavioral conditions like\ninsomnia, depression, anxiety. And I was\nworking on a new depression therapeutic.\nAnd so I went very deep on this and\nwas working with a really wonderful\nclinical team full of clinical\npsychologists who helped me understand\nthe techniques that therapists use when\nthey are working with people who\nhave depression. And so much of\ndepression is characterized by these\nnegative thinking patterns and this like\nthis feeling that I feel bad and I just\nneed to wait until I feel better and\nthen I'll start doing the things that\nare good for me. Right? I don't feel\nlike responding to this text, so I'm\njust not going to do it, but I'll\nrespond when I feel better. I don't feel\nlike working out, so I'm not going to do\nit, but I'll do it when I feel better.\nAnd the truth is I it that doesn't go\naway on its own especially if you have\ndepression. And it's something that\nagain you you the idea of behavioral\nactivation is\nyou have to identify these actions\nthat you can take that will reverse that\nnegative spiral and will improve your\nmood. And so the the sort of like\nmisconception is I'll feel better and\nthen I'll act. And the thing that\ntherapists try to teach people when\nthey're working with them in therapy is\nI will act and then I will feel better.\nBut acting is hard if you are in the\nthrows of depression. And so easier said\nthan done. And a lot of the work is\nin how you help people identify specific\nactions that they can take that will\nreliably lift their mood. And I I mean I\nhave a list of myself. I have a list on\nmy phone of my behavioral activations.\nAnd it's things that I know I can do if\nI start feeling like the walls are\nclosing in around me. If I if I like\nfeel myself kind of getting sucked into\nlike very low mood or negative\nthinking or whatever it is. And you can\nyou can see how effective that is at\njust getting you out of there versus the\ninstinct to just sort of like go and lie\nin bed and feel bad for yourself.\nWhich I I understand very well. And so\nthat understanding that concept which is\nyou know at its core a therapeutic\nconcept used in cognitive behavioral\ntherapy. But it kind of it kind of\nchanged how I see the entire world. And\nI how I see especially as a manager\nthe ways that people on my team think\nand behave and how easy it is to get\nstuck in some of these like downward\nspirals that you really need to actively\npush back on. And as a manager I want to\nhelp them do that. And I want to help\nthem see that like see the ways they\nare in some ways sabotaging themselves\ngetting in their own ways with\nwhatever is going on in their head. And\nthen I want to help them\ncounterprogram it in themselves and also\nyou know as I said counterprogram the\nthings that you are worried about out\nthere as well. So interesting. So the\ncore of this technique is what's a an\naction and you said this it could be\nvery small that you can take that in\nthis case shows someone else you're not\nthey're not you're not who they think\nyou are. Like you're worried they think\nthink about you in a certain way and you\nwant to take an action that helps them\nsee you're not that. So that yes that's\nthe taking the punch concept. The\nbehavioral activation could be anything\nright. It can be it can be picking up a\npiece of laundry off of the chair and\nputting it away and that's just sort of\nenough to get you out of the downward\nthing you're in. So behavioral\nactivation just conceptually is you\nknow how are you taking action to\nreverse the the downward feeling or the\nnegative feeling that you're feeling and\nthen the take a punch concept is kind of\nthat applied in the context of I'm in a\nworking environment. I am very conscious\nof how I'm being perceived by other\npeople that's causing me a great deal of\nstress. I think especially for product\npeople who are you know so much of\ntheir self-identity is wrapped up in\nhaving the answers being competent\ngetting things done and so many of\nthem have been people who have been\nreally good at that for most of their\ncareers which is how they got into these\njobs in the first place. I think that can\nbe an extremely stressful thing for them\nthat in many cases can be like the\ndriver of burnout and the driver of like\nI I can't really handle the stress of\nthis job anymore. And so I think of\nthe the take a punch concept is is more\njust applied to that sort of specific\nproblem of I'm struggling at work and\nI'm struggling largely because of my\nperceptions of other people. And I\nwant to feel more agency in that\nsituation. This is so cool. Okay. On the\nidea of the specific take a punch\nconcept, what kind of impact have you\nseen this have on people's mood and\ncareers? Is this like how big a deal is\nthis specific tactic? Well, I think it's\na big deal like on two levels. One, it's\na big deal because it can help you in a\ncrisis or a minor crisis, but I actually\nthink it's a bigger deal because\nI see so many people who don't put\nthemselves out there because they're\nafraid of how it's going to go. And so,\nI think of the like classic example of\nI'm often trying to encourage people\nto like speak up in meetings more. To\npractice the skill of how you move a\nconversation forward in a way that\ncontributes value both because doing\nso I think is is important because\nnobody wants to be in bad meetings but\nalso because it will help with your\ncareer right like this is how you kind\nof get on people's radar as somebody\nwho's like oh that person's got great\nideas thinks about things the right way\nwhatever it is. I think it's just it's\none of these things that I talk to\npeople about it and that you know they\nthey are interested in coming to the\nmeeting and hearing about these big\ndecisions are getting made, but they\njust kind of want to sit there and\nobserve. And I'm like, first of all,\nlike every additional person in a\nmeeting has a cost because every\nadditional person in a meeting makes the\npeople in that meeting less candid than\nthey would have been if there were fewer\npeople in that meeting. And so, one key\npiece of a meeting is like you usually\nhave a problem you're trying to solve\ncollectively as a group. And it's really\nhard to do that if people are being\noverly cautious about what they're\nsaying because there's like too many\npeople in there. So, when I tell\npeople this, I'm like, you know, it's\nreally important that you earn your\nplace in this meeting. And let's\nwork on like how to do that. And the\ncore piece of that is like you've got to\nsay stuff that's valuable. And people\nalways come up with all these excuses\nfor why they can't do it. And one thing\nI've learned is that I think people are\nreally good at coming up with very\nrational sounding reasons to not do\nthings that just make them\nuncomfortable. But in their head\nthey're like, \"Oh no, you know, like I'm\nI'm too junior. Like nobody wants to\nhear what I have to say or everyone was\nalready thinking it or you know, I\nyou know, I like to process things\ninternally and by the time I say them,\nthe conversation's moved on, whatever it\nis.\" And so so much of like that\nskill, it's like a communication skill\nat its core. It's just how to express\nyourself verbally. But so much of the\nthe blocker of that is I think fear.\nFear of saying the wrong thing, fear of\nlooking stupid, fear of just the the\ndiscomfort of everyone in a room turning\nand looking at you, right, as you're\nkind of like trying to formulate a\nhalf-baked thought. And so if you can\nhelp people be less afraid of that,\nthat's like 90% of the challenge of\nactually improving some of these skills.\nAnd so I think when you give people\nthe skills of taking a punch, you are\nhelping them feel less afraid of getting\nthe punch in the first place. And\nthat's why I think it's so important.\nThat's profound. The second order effect\nof the skill. There's something you\nmentioned when we were chatting earlier\nthat stuck with me with this idea\nthat too many PMs and too many people\nare playing on easy mode and not trying\nhard things. Oh, leaving myself in\ntrouble here. Okay, let's do it. Say\nmore.\nOh, I think this is my hot take. Like,\nyou know, you hear people talking about\ncraft and taste and product management\nand it's all very wonderful. And I\nI'm like totally on board. Like, I love\nit. I'm I'm a sucker for that kind of\nthing. But I'm like, well, if if you are\nlike really in it just for pure love of\nthe game, like you just love product\nmanagement. Like why are you building\nproducts for people exactly like you who\nhave all your exact same problems at a\ncompany that sells to other companies\nthat doesn't worry about pricing. Like\nthere's no real I mean there's I don't\nwant to I don't want to act like I think\nthis is easy to be clear. But in the\nlike the grand scheme of things like I\nwish that the people who have this pure\nlove of product management and have this\npure love of building things that you\nwould see more of that applied to\nbuilding for low-income people building\nfor you know social services things like\nthat that really really need that kind\nof work. And I think there's a you a\nlevel of prestige obviously associated\nwith working in certain companies and\nyou know you get less of that in in\nother industries and so people would\nnaturally gravitate toward that. And\nI you know I totally get.\n\n\nIt. I totally get you get paid better. Like, no, no real judgment for me. Uh, I just I wish I saw more, but I wish you would see more people, and I'll say this: I know there's a lot of you out there. I know there's a ton of people out there doing really, really important work in really, really hard spaces. Uh, and I see you, and I appreciate it, and shout out to you. Awesome. Okay, I'm glad you shared that. Thank you. I think this will resonate with a lot of people. I want to move on to another trait, skill that you are good at and help people learn, which is being very transparent in what's happening within the organization, within your thinking. You almost help people think the way you think and see the way you think so that they can operate at a higher level. Just talk about that, what that looks like, and why that's important. It's interesting. I think another thing I hear a lot of people complain about in organizations is like, the \"why do 10 people have to sign off on this email before I send it?\" kind of problem. And I think the answer to that is like, because those 10 people all have different information, different context, and in many cases, completely different, like, working models for how the CEO of the company and other strategic leaders in the company think, and it makes things super inefficient. I think people will often say like, \"Oh, it's a process problem.\" It's not a process problem. It's not an approval proc problem. It's a, I think it's a transparency and it's communication problem, like downward communication, outward communication. And what I mean by that is, um, when I think about like artifact-based communication, so reading a strategy document, for example, everyone at the company reads strategy document, great, everyone is working from the same idea of what the strategy is, but then things change, right? Like, especially if you're working in a really dynamic space, uh, new competitive threats emerge, new opportunities emerge all the time. This is especially true now with AI. Obviously, everyone is lighting their strategies on fire and trying to figure out the best way to sort of transform their organization. And so, if you're, you're, if the way that you understand what's going on at the company is from reading a document that was written six months ago, you're going to be working from outdated information, and you're not going to be able to like, think and respond to new things that happen. And so what is what much more helpful than understanding what your CEO thinks is, I think, understanding how your CEO thinks. Um, and that goes for all sorts of levels of the company. I want to understand how all the strategic leaders in my company think, and I want my team to understand how I think. And when I feel confident that people on my team understand how I think, like, I don't need to read their emails, I don't need to approve things. The times where I feel like I need to do that is because I'm working with people where I'm like, \"I don't, I don't have confidence that these people understand how I think, or I don't have confidence that they understand how this, uh, this email or whatever it is, is going to be received by this important person.\" Um, and so I try to teach that to my team. And the way that I do that is a few ways. Uh, first, I'm in meetings with people, like, important people at the company. Um, so I'm constantly hearing the things that they're saying and paying attention to sort of the note behind the note. Why do I think they're saying this? What do I, what insight do they have that they're bringing to this conversation that might not be obvious? Um, and I try to make an effort every week, I don't always do it, but I try to send my team just a quick rundown in Slack of, \"Here are the most important conversations or the most interesting conversations I had this week. Here's what that person said verbatim.\" Again, I, I write a lot of notes, so I've got it. Um, if you've got a transcriber, maybe that'll help you. And here's, here's what I interpret that as. Here's why I think they say that. Here's where I think that's coming from. And here's what I'm going to do differently as a result. And these aren't long. And sometimes if I don't have time, I'll just like, in a team meeting, I'll literally just go through my notes from the week and sort of voice over stuff and editorialize it as I go. Um, and over time, I think my, my team has like a pretty good sense of what people are saying and, and how to think about, uh, the thinking behind it and how this person thinks, how this person thinks, and how I think. And I think when you get an entire organization working that way, where everyone's working from the same models of like, how what the CEO thinks matters, uh, what level of like risk tolerance the company has, things like that, then you can actually start to move much, much faster, and communication becomes much, much, much less painful. So the tactic here is to help your team kind of build a mental model of everyone in the company that matters so that it's like the way you put it almost is when they're emailing them or asking for something, they, they already know how they're going to respond. Is there, is there an example you could share of something like this, of just like, something a person at WHOOP of how they think? I don't know, maybe you can keep it anonymous just to make this a little real of the kind of mental model you might want to build around someone. So, our CEO, Will, is, uh, somebody who obsesses over pixels in a way that, um, is, you know, challenging to get things through a design review, but I think results in a product that is a thousand times better than it would be if, uh, he were accepting of, you know, small, uh, excuses here and there for, \"Oh, well, this, you know, we had to cut scope here. We couldn't quite do what they wanted here.\" Like, he sets a high bar and he holds it. Um, and he doesn't compromise. And I think this can sometimes get misconstrued, and I think a lot of people might think that he just wants like maximal scope on everything. Um, and I think that is a misunderstanding of what he cares about. Uh, we often get feedback from him that's like, \"You know, this doesn't, this doesn't feel like the future,\" and everything that we're building needs to feel like the future. A lot of people hear that, and they're kind of like, \"Oh, gosh, like, you know, we're never gonna get this thing done on time. Like, we can't make any sort of sacrifices to scope or anything like that.\" But when I hear that, like, what I hear is more that with we have this AI coach in the product. We have all this amazing data in the product. Uh, you know, we're tracking every single one of your heartbeats, and we're pulling out all this other data, and we have every, like, every screen is a moment to show that to people in a way that feels like something that has never existed before. And there are small ways to do that, right? It's like how you pull in, if you're explaining a concept like, uh, VO₂ max, which is, you know, a measure of your cardiovascular health, you can explain that to people with static content, or you can explain that to people by bringing their data into, you know, the, the method of explanation that you're using. You can make it really conversational because you're using this AI coach. You can make it feel more like you're talking to a person, and a person who, by the way, has all the data about you, which doesn't exist today. Like, your doctor doesn't have that. Your coach doesn't have that. And that's not like, \"Oh, gosh, we've got to blow up the scope on this thing and make it 100x as big.\" But it's finding these like, little touches to say like, \"Wow, that was really magical. That was really thoughtful. And this, this feels like the future. This feels like I'm very conscious of the fact that this product knows so much about me and is able to sort of sort out the, the, um, signal from the noise on that in these really small and elegant ways.\" And so for something like that, like, I would get that feedback in design review, or I'd hear that in a design review, and maybe one of my PMs would be in that design review. Um, and so I bring that to the team, and I hear things like that in a few different design reviews. So, I bring those back to the team, and I'm like, \"I've noticed that recently we are consistently getting this type of feedback. Uh, here's why I think it's really important to Will, uh, because I think he's really focused on building, you know, the, the health company of the future. And I don't want you all to think that this just means like, we have to just throw AI at everything, and we have to just throw like maximum scope at everything. I think the key is understanding like, on the matrix of, uh, cost and effort for, uh, impact, like, what are those high-impact but low-cost ways that we can just find and sprinkle through the experience, um, and, and really try to make that magical.\" Uh, so I'm connecting the dots for my team, right? I'm saying, \"You weren't in all these meetings, but I saw it. Here's what I heard. Here's my interpretation of what I heard. Um, and here's how I'm thinking about how this other person thinks about it.\" And so as a result, like, here are some things that I think we can do in across our product going forward. Essentially, these are principles or values or tenants per person of what matters to them. So for Nick, it's this needs to feel like we're living in the future. It can't just be like another, uh, heartbeat tracking app. Yeah. This is so cool. And there's so much trickle-down benefit to this. One is people feel like they're aware of what's happening. That's one of the most common, I think, piece of feedback people have at big companies, like, \"I don't know what's happening,\" and so there's so much visibility, all the secretive stuff happening in the meetings, like, \"I don't know what people are deciding my fates and all these discussions.\" So I think just even knowing that you're sharing all this is so powerful. Well, and that on that note, like, when I approach these conversations, I always try to think of them as, um, even if I don't agree with the feedback, if I don't agree with the decision, like, what is the insight that I'm missing? Like, how am I wrong about this in ways, like, what would be true for this other person to be right? And I'll go through that thought exercise, and I might not get to the other side and agree with it. I might still, you know, think I'm right or whatever. But often times, it forcing myself to think that way forces me to think about how this other person thinks it. And if I do that enough, I will be like, \"Oh, this makes sense. I think this makes sense if, and oh, maybe this other thing is true.\" And I think when I, when I hear the people, the people who are like, \"I don't know what's going on with this company,\" like, I think they do the opposite. Like, I think they look for reasons to disagree, and they look for holes to poke in. \"Well, this decision doesn't make any sense because I came up with something that might be wrong about it.\" And I think that's another thing, by the way, in terms of just sort of like helping your team have the emotional maturity to exist and thrive in an organization is, is helping them think that way. Like, helping them understand you have a point of view. Your point of view is important. Um, but on some level, like, you do kind of have to have respect for these other points of view and have the humility to think that like, maybe they, they're on to something that you're not on to. And it's amazing how much you can like, learn and intuit it without having to have all the facts just by doing that. If you're like, \"Well, this person's behavior makes sense in a situation where X, Y, and Z is happening,\" often times you will find that X, Y, and Z is happening. I'm glad you went there. I wanted to actually follow this thread, which is kind of a different direction, but I think a lot of people are always struggling with this as a leader when your leader disagree does, says something that you completely disagree with, but you still need to represent that as like, \"Here's the thing we're doing,\" but you don't want to be like, \"Oh, just cuz Nick said so,\" you know, because you lose power as a leader. Do you have any, just, is there like something you've learned about how to do that well when your leader tells you to do something you disagree with and you still need to get your team to do it? First, I, I do try to go through like the, the \"what if I'm wrong\" exercise. Uh, I think a lot of people just sort of like expect that if you ask somebody as a, a open-ended question, like, \"Why are we doing this?\" you're going to get a straightforward answer. And oftentimes, the answer is not straightforward for various reasons. Like, maybe there's confidentiality reasons. Uh, maybe there's just like, you know, the, somebody is acting on a hunch, but that hunch is informed by years or decades of reps of developing judgment, and like, they're probably really on to something. It's not just like this kind of arbitrary gut feeling, but whatever it is, like, I really try to get to the bottom of, \"Let me, let me really make sure that I have done my best to understand this person's point of view.\" Um, and I have some sort of tools for doing that, which I can also talk about. But if I've done that and I still disagree, I'm like, relatively candid about that, but candid in a way where like, it's still respectful. Like, I think what you want to avoid is a situation where as a manager, you're like, \"Uh, this, you know, I have no control. This sucks. This decision is so stupid.\" But like, that's the job, so we have to do it. Like, obviously that's not going to, you know, set your team up for success or make anybody happy about it. But you do, you do hear that. You do see that happening. And so I think what I try to do in those situations is separate out like my opinion from it from the like, \"Well, what is the insight that makes it make sense to this person?\" and explain their rationale, even if I'm comfortable saying like, \"You know, I don't necessarily think like this isn't how I would do it, or, uh, I don't even really agree with how they're thinking about it, but from their point of view, from their perspective, uh, their professional experience, whatever it is, I could see how this makes sense, and like, they might be, I don't think they're right, but they might be. Let's find out.\" Like, we're not going to find out if we are all squabbling about whether this is a good idea the whole time. Like, the only way we're going to find out is if we give it the best shot that we have and try to do it. And if we're wrong, like, that happens sometimes, and we try.\n\n\nAgain, I like that this comes back to your mental model orientation of here's their mental model. Here's what their experience has been like. Here's how they see the world, the trends, and then this is why they think the way they think.\n\nAnd so instead of encouraging your team or yourself even to be like, \"No, no, you're wrong here,\" it's more, \"Okay, here's their data set. Let's try this and this will inform that data set and maybe change their mind.\" Yeah. Because I think in product, like I like to joke, there's no right answers, right? You're just there's only wrong answers and you're just trying to execute well on like the least wrong answer that's available to you. Uh, and so I think it is like, you know, the sort of reasonable people can disagree about this of it all of you know, like this is what I think and this is how I approach it. I think this is what they think and I think this is why they would approach it this way. And again, like the only chance we have of succeeding is not being torn apart on that. And so at the end of the day, like if it's not a like a obviously terrible answer, and sometimes even if it is an obviously terrible answer, you're still more likely to succeed if you just sort of like sort of reorient yourself around a world where it's not a terrible answer and then just try to will that into existence.\n\nYou said that you have some tools to help you understand someone's point of view. I can't help but ask more about that. I talk about what I like to call magic questions, but the thing about magic questions is they're not actually questions. Their statements and they end with do you agree or is that right? And so I have found this as like the most helpful way for kind of trying to understand a person's uh mental model is to just like put facts in front of them and see what they say no to and what they say yes to. And then if you can get them to explain, great. And if they're good communicators, they often can. Um, but if they're not, like you don't have to let that stop you. And so I mean I I I'll do this even just as an example uh in a non-leadership context with uh if I'm working with like legal teams or compliance teams or things like that, they are often working from a a literal set of rules, right? There are laws, there are regulations. Um, and you are trying to understand like what you know, if we were to take this path, would that be okay? Would that not be okay? And sometimes that's that's not straightforward. Um, sometimes like there's regulatory areas that are um, you know, up to interpretation. And so when I first started working in like a regulated space, I would find this kind of frustrating and confusing because I would say, can you just like, can you just like give me the the rule so I can understand what's right and what's left of it? And they'd be like, oh, well, it depends, it depends, depends. And so I learned that if I kind of flipped that and approached that like, well, you know, what if we did X, Y, and Z, like what if this is what it looked like? What if this is what the copy said, would that be okay? No. Yes. If no, why? If yes, why? And so, I'm sort of teasing out the mental model rather than asking them to explain it to me. And this is what I tell my team all the time to do this to me. Like, when they come to me and they say, \"What would you think I should do?\" Or, um, you know, what could I have done differently? I'll say like, \"Rephrase that as tell me what you think you could have done differently and then ask me if I agree.\"\n\nAnd when I do this, I think it it has a few benefits. One, it helps them kind of calibrate their judgment over time. So, they're they're actually forcing themselves to make this assertion, and then they're kind of calibrating how close that was to like how I would think about it. Um, which will get you much faster, much further than just asking open-ended questions and getting the answer. And then the second part of it is, um, they don't become reliant on me for answering these questions. I think that's kind of a trap that a lot of managers fall into is you people come to you with questions, you want to help them, you answer the question, and then you find that they come to you with all their questions and you're kind of like, yeah, you got to solve some of these on your own. So, again, I think like the magic questions to me, is that right? Do you agree? And anytime you find yourself like tempted to ask an open-ended question to somebody whose brain you're trying to understand, stop yourself and say like, let me just say that. Let me say as a statement what I think and then try to calibrate based on their reaction and like I think that's the fastest way to understand how another person thinks.\n\nThere it makes me think about a lot of people, like it sound it could come across as it's like a weird manipulative way of asking someone stuff, but it turns out that like we're not good at really knowing what we think or know a lot of times and you need someone almost to interview you in a really effective way to get out all this knowledge and this is just a really simple way of getting that idea.\n\nYou know, it's funny because I've like uh when I talk about this, I get that reaction a lot where people are like, \"Well, doesn't it feel coercive?\" And I'm like, \"Well, you got to go in pure of heart.\" Like, you've got to go in open to being wrong and even expecting to be wrong. And you have to make that clear to them, right? Like, if you're coming in and you're like, \"Here's what I think.\" Like, you agree, you you agree. Like, of course, you're not going to get the answer you want. Or I mean, you might get the answer you want. You might get a yes. If your goal is to get to yes, that's not what I'm that's not what I'm talking about. If your goal is to understand and you are coming from like a help me understand how I'm wrong, help me understand what I'm getting wrong here. Um, and approach it with that sort of like curiosity and humility. Um, and make sure that you're like carrying yourself and presenting yourself to this person in a way that that that shows that that you're not coming in like hostile or forceful or something. Um, yeah, because there are absolutely circumstances where you're doing that and you're going to get bad intel because you're making the person uncomfortable, so they're going to lie to you. But that's like a I think a whole set of interpersonal skills that we probably don't have time to talk about today.\n\nI wanted to come back to you said this uh interesting insight about your CEO that he wanted to build something that uh was felt like the future. Uh I just wanted to share there's a story that has always stuck with me at Airbnb. There was a a big launch coming up and there was a designer sitting at late in the office trying to re-update the website to include this new product. It was a launch of Airbnb neighborhoods like I don't know 10 years ago and he's and she was just like, \"Hey Joe,\" and this is Joe Gebbia. I was walking around the office and she's like, \"Hey Joe, what do you think I should what do you want the website to be? What do you want it to look like? What should we try to?\" And it was going to launch in two days. He's like, \"Build something the internet has never seen before.\"\n\nAnd now this makes me like, it's interesting because when I always think about that story and tell that story, it's like this is a crazy ask. And now as you share an approach for how to handle something like that, it really changes my perspective to like, okay, what's Joe's world view? Why why is that the way he saw the world and why we needed to build a site like that? Which I I could start thinking about, but that's a really interesting way to just like handle things that sound absurd and out of nowhere.\n\nI agree so much. I uh proud former English major and so I'm a huge proponent of reading fiction and and reading in general. And um I I feel like that's where so much of this comes from for me is just like a curiosity for like in in what world does this make sense for this person? Uh and it's so easy to look at another person's behaviors and another person's actions and what they say and just be like that doesn't make any sense. And I just I find that I don't know like your relationships become so much richer even just in a work context like when you approach it with that like what what is the world of this person where the thing that they're saying makes sense. And I like I feel like in my life honestly like a lot of my frustration has come from being frustrated with other people. And so this is something that I I've had to learn over time because when I come home from work and I'm just like, \"Ah, this person said this and it didn't make any sense and this person's totally out to lunch and leadership doesn't know what's going on.\" Like all I was doing was making myself miserable. Uh and actually worse than that, I was making myself miserable and I was making myself pretty useless to the company. And so I would get frustrated because I was like, you know, no, nobody appreciates my perfect, unique, beautiful insight. Um, and all these other people have no unique, beautiful, perfect, concise, just wrong opinions. And so I feel like that's been like a big area of growth for me, honestly, is uh, like learning to approach people that way. It's not just like, oh, this is a nice thing to do, but I think it it like genuinely makes me a happier person. Uh, and yeah, I think I think a lot of it comes from reading fiction.\n\nH, I love that we're just unpacking the onion of the power of this very specific habit of just helping you learn the mental model of the people around you. And I feel like this is just making me sound like a crazy voice. No, there's so much power to this. Like it's it's as you talk I'm like wow, there's so much value here because not only is it you talk about how this is the source of a lot of burnout for a lot of people where they're just so frustrated. The CEO or the chief product officer designer is just like I hate this. Where are they just asking all these ridiculous things? Keeping the bar way too high. It's just nothing's ever good enough. But not only does it help you feel better about their asks because you can understand where they're coming from, it also helps you be more effective in helping them change their mind potentially and see a different perspective because now you see the data that informs their perspective and you could help adjust that or or kind of poke at it like, \"Hey, are you sure this is true? Are you sure like I don't know your competitor and this is how they see it? Maybe it's not. Let's let's look into that a little deeper.\n\nYeah, it's really interesting. I uh I at my last company when I started reporting to the CEO, um they found various coaches for me to work with and one of them was the former chief product officer at Coinbase who's gone to found Bridge, which is just got acquired by Stripe for a ton of money. And one thing that he said to me that really stuck with me is when you're reporting to the CEO and like if as a chief product officer, the big mistake that people make is they think that the game is all about getting what is inside their head and like influencing the CEO, influencing the people around them to make it so. And if you go into the role trying to do that, you're going to fail because actually like what your job is to do is to understand what the CEO's vision is and like what they care about. Again, sort of how they think about things um and figure out how to operationalize that in a way that results in the best possible manifestation of it in the form of product. And that was just such a like radically different way from what I ever thought my job was. Uh again to go back to sort of the fiction example, like you know, you kind of you kind of come up thinking like you're the protagonist and you can be the protagonist in your life. You can be the protagonist in the story of your family, but in the in the story of your work, like of a company, uh, like you are probably not the protagonist. And as much as it, you know, can feel kind of weird to say that, I I genuinely think like some of the best advice I've gotten in my life in terms of things that have just not only transformed how I see the world and how I act in it, but just like my own sense of happiness is like you're not special. And it's like I used to spend so much time and energy just being like, oh, like people aren't people don't see it my way and I have to convince them. And when you're in an organization, like it's a it's an ecosystem, right? Like it's a it's an organization full of people who are all trying to work together to get a thing done. And if every single one of those people is operating from their own like protagonist viewpoint of this is how I actually see the world. This is what I think we're here to do and I need to convince everyone around me at all times. Like it becomes extremely inefficient. It becomes extremely painful because you're just everyone's just fighting all the time. And so in some ways, like it feels like you're kind of uh like if it sounds almost defeatist, like I'm always worried about the sounding like I'm just like, yeah, just do whatever the boss says. Um, and that's not how I feel at all. Like I think it's incredibly important to bring your skills and your talents and your perspective to the job you have. Um, and and really your taste and your craft and all of these things. Um, but I do think this idea of like understanding how to build a shared mental model of everyone together that definitionally cannot be defined by your own narrow perspective. Um, actually just makes work a lot better for everybody.\n\nSo then a lot of people like you said, I love that you went there. It's just like if you're because it could sound like okay, your job is just to execute what the CEO tells you. There's no value to your insights and perspectives and you're just get out of the way. You're just let's get everyone to do the thing the CEO wants. Where do you I guess in your experience or just advice on where's the fulfillment for you then as a CPO or example or a director of product where you know it's not that fun\n\n\nJust to be there executing a co's vision and not have any input.\nWell, and I think like there's so many decisions all the way down, and there's so many like micro places where you can zig where others would have zagged.\nAnd I think I personally like a lot of where my fulfillment comes from is from feeling like if somebody else were in this job, it would be done differently.\nAnd like something about the product is different because I was the one who worked on it, because I was in the job.\nAnd that that comes from like my unique perspective, my unique point of view, the experiences I've had in the past, like my various influences.\nUm, and I think it's trying to like figure out the right level for it so that you're not pushing against an immovable force.\nUm, you know, it's almost like if you're playing Jenga and you're sort of trying to feel around to find like, okay, well, where are the pieces that can move?\nAnd when you know how somebody else thinks, you can find that there are immovable forces.\nThose are not the battles worth fighting.\nBut there are also areas where maybe they don't know as much.\nAnd there's also areas where maybe like they're actually kind of scared because they don't know as much.\nAnd maybe that's an area where you have an interesting point of view.\nAnd so you can step into that role and be tremendously valuable and and being tremendously influential.\nBut you can only do that if you have a good like uh frame for kind of what you're what the what the model is and where are the things where it's like okay we are operating on a person's insight here that is it is itself extremely unique and extremely valuable and it is the reason this company even exists in the first place, but that I mean there's millions of decisions have to get made, you know what I mean, uh, and there's millions of different places that that you can put yourself.\nUm, and so I think it's just like constantly feeling out for like where are the places that I'm really spiky?\nWhere are the things that I think I do really well?\nUh, where are the gaps?\nAnd again, you can only you can only find those if you're engaging in really good faith and engaging earnestly and and like really understanding how other people think.\nThere's two really interesting thoughts that I have as you're talking that I think will even further crystallize what you're saying.\nOne is that you're just saying this is the way the world works.\nIt makes me think about Jeffrey Pfeffer.\nHe was a guest on this podcast.\nHe teaches this class at Stanford Business School about how to how to gain power in the world.\nIt's like the rules of power and uh he talks about, you know, it's like it and it's like all these ways to to influence and win and achieve and gain status and all these things.\nAnd he's like, you know, this part doesn't sound fun and and great, but I talk about here's the way the world works and is not the way you wish it would be.\nAnd what you're describing is the way a company works is the CEO is in charge and your job is to, you know, they're the boss.\nAnd the sooner you understand their vision trumps your vision, the easier everything gets.\nLike you're not there to tell the CEO, here's what we should be building, right?\nTheir job is to own the vision of the business and the company.\nYeah, I think that's true.\nAnd if you don't if you disagree with it, like you probably shouldn't be working on that company.\nYeah.\nThe other piece is it's just the vision like here's the vision of the future of where we are heading.\nIf we win, here's what will be true and the world will look like, but there's so much more that you need to figure out that is to achieve that vision, and that's basically the role of this of the CPO and director of products, all those sort of and of everyone at that level.\nHow you said it there was so is so right on because it is like the vision is is in many ways, I mean, in some ways it's execution based, but in many ways it's a vision of what the world is going to look like in five years, in 10 years.\nAnd so in in some ways I would say like your your job is if you can understand that and you can understand here's what this person thinks the world is going to look like, uh, assuming all that is true, what are the things that I can do to maximize the chances of that and like becoming the actual future, and then also what does that mean for a product?\nLike what does that mean for uh if if it has to be true that like you know take for example if uh if there's a vision of the future where you have all of your health data in one place and we're able to detect health issues before you even know you have them and we're able to do really hyperpersonalized coaching uh to help you understand like how your behaviors today are impacting how healthy you're going to be in in decades.\nUh, what does that mean for what WHOOP needs to be today, and what does that mean for how it needs to evolve in the next couple years in order to both make that a reality, but also like win in that world?\nUm, and I do think that's exactly where the like the people in the rank and file can be tremendously influential.\nIt's that level of like I'm going to fight with you about how the world's going to work in five years, where I think you're you're just fighting a losing battle.\nAnd if you don't like the vision, you could leave, right?\nIt's like or change try to change it.\nLike those are two options.\nAnd I think to your point about pushing back, because you asked about this, like I again, I I never want it to sound like I'm just like defeist, like just accept it.\nLike I'm a very opinionated person.\nUh, like I go to the math for things that I think are true.\nAnd so I I you know I teach my team like you have to be really good at forming arguments and that can be that can show up in different ways.\nLike some people are really good at doing that with data.\nSome people are really good at doing that with you know sort of the qual and the quant and moving it together.\nUm, but you have to be able to advocate for what you think is true in the most compelling way possible, and you have an obligation to do it, and if you have done it and you've done it well and it didn't work, that's when it's time to say, well, maybe there's something here that, you know, that I wasn't seeing previously.\nUm, and that's where I think, you know, it's time to have some humility around it.\nBut this, you know, there it's it's a journey.\nYou don't you don't start from like, well, I got I got nothing to say here.\nUm, so I think it's, you know, knowing where you are on that journey is important, too.\nThis reminds me, there's a PM leader at Airbnb who ended up leading a new initiative and they ended up doing a bunch of stupid stuff and he's like, I just I'm realizing that it's me that needs to be pushing back on stuff now that I'm in charge of this product team.\nUh, I'm the person that needs to convince the CEO this is a bad idea.\nAnd I I I'm just realizing that after doing a bunch of stuff that was stupid.\nAnd you do like you will see bad ideas and you do have an obligation to try to convince them that it's a bad idea.\nAnd you're going to be right sometimes and you're not going to be right every time.\nAnd I think that like that's why it's so hard to talk about these things in absolutes because like sometimes you're right and sometimes you're not right.\nAnd it is important to get really good at knowing the difference and knowing uh where you go from there.\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio, the AI native CRM.\nAttio is built to scale with your business from day one.\nConnect your email and calendar and Attio instantly

really get at.\nBut first of all, something I noted that I wanted to touch on real quick.\nYou mentioned that WHOOP now does VO₂ max, and not this not a promotion for WHOOP, but that's so cool.\nThat's like a huge thing to track that this is like the thing that Peter Attia and all these guys are always saying.\nThis is the thing you want to track to understand your health and progress is your VO₂ max.\nIt's like your blood oxygen level.\nI don't know exactly what it is, but uh but that's cool.\nThe new lets you do that.\nThere's so much cool stuff we're doing right now.\nI'm like I don't know if I want to get into it all right now, but I can.\nWe'll get back to it.\nWe'll get back to it.\nAll right, let's get back to it.\nOkay, cool.\nYeah.\nUm, okay.\nSo, another habit slash skill that you are really good at that I've heard from folks is, and you've mentioned this a couple times, is just building habits, helping your team build good habits.\nAnd coming back to the CBT stuff, just like behavior loops and things like that.\nTalk about just what that is, why that's important, what you help your team learn there.\nYeah, I'm kind of obsessed with habit formation and reward loops and behavior change and all of these things.\nAnd um when I think about trying to change behavior on your team or just trying to like encourage your team to do more of the behaviors that you believe are associated with success, I think a lot of people think about it like more of like an education model where it's like, you know, you teach the thing, you assess the thing, and then you there's like some accountability around the thing.\nAnd um I think if you if you think about it more in the context of behavioral psychology, it actually works a lot better.\nAnd so I'll give you an example.\nUm I've like many leaders have been trying to uh think about how to drive AI adoption, AI upskilling on my team.\nAnd uh when I talk to people about this outside of the company, I'm always surprised because they're like, \"Well, how, you know, how do you measure it and how do you enforce it?\"\nAnd uh I don't I don't really think about any of that stuff.\nLike I'm thinking about like how am I creating habits around using this?\nAnd for me, there's a couple things there.\nSo it's uh consistency.\nUm how are you getting someone doing something every single day?\nAnd to do that, like it has to start small.\nIt has to start super easy.\nYou have to give them things that take no more than a minute or two to do.\nUm, and I actually I have like um 30 days of GPT, I call it, of like a list of 30 things to do, one every single day that I don't know anyone who has gone through this and like not come out the other side feeling a hundred times more confident in their skills and actually using it every day as a habit.\nUm, because it's built like as a habit formation tool and not an education tool.\nUm, this is using a specific GPT built or building their own GPT or what's the habit there?\nUh, the habit is using chat GBT or cloud or any of the tools to get their work done.\nUm, in just sort of like a kind of generic get work done way.\nUm, and so I have this little tool if you sign up for my newsletter, I'll send it to you.\nUm, what's the URL of the newsletter while you as you mentioned that?\nThanks for asking.\nIt is hills.substack.com.\nhi ls.substack.com.\nSweet.\nBut basically, it's one little thing you can do every single day.\nAnd the key with this is again consistency.\nSo you need to get people doing this thing every day.\nUh reducing friction.\nI think a mistake a lot of people make when they start thinking about how to drive adoption is they're like, \"Oh, we have to show people how to do their work with these tools.\"\nBut I'm like, well, work is hard.\nAnd if you are on a deadline for something, you've got to get something done.\nThe last thing that you ever want is more friction associated with getting it done.\nLike it is so annoying when you're trying to get a thing done and like your tools are being changed on you and you don't know how the thing works and like you know the hot keys are all different or whatever.\nUm, and so I actually think like using it in uh like situations that have nothing to do with your work um are way easier because you're removing all of that friction of like, oh wait, I got to go think about all right, what's a project that I'm working on?\nOh, I put this into chatbt and I like didn't really get a good answer and now I'm frustrated because this thing's taking longer than I need it to take or whatever.\nUm, and so, you know, I start with things that are just like fun, simple use cases.\nUh like you know it might be coming up with times to take a vacation or places to go on vacation or it might be like uploading your calendar into chatbt and asking it for ideas for talking points for the meetings or like things where the person doesn't have to think because it's all just spelled out and things where like there's no there's no like external work pressure that you have to apply this to that's going to make it like an unpleasant experience.\nSo consistency, reduce friction, and then most importantly designing reward loops.\nAnd this is something that when I'm talking to people about designing for behavior change, the number one thing I always tell them is you are not thinking enough about the reward loop.\nAnd the reward loop needs to be powerful.\nIt needs to be immediate and it needs to be emotional so that when this person does the thing that you want them to do, they feel like a million bucks.\nAnd so when I think about any kind of habit I'm trying to to build on my team, that's something that I'm I'm always thinking about is like how can I make sure that when a person does this, they feel really great.\nAnd part of why I like custom GPTs as a tool for helping\n\n\nPeople learn to use LLMs, and I talk about this on the podcast I did with Claire on how AI is because if you put in the prompt, you, as the person building the custom GPT, you write the prompt, you put it in, you design it such that somebody can upload a specific document, and then they can get a specific output, like feedback on that document, or, you know, maybe something more fun than feedback, an improved written version of that document. They get the joy of, like, \"Oh, this helped me. This was cool,\" without any of the despair of, \"Oh, I'm not very good at prompting, and this didn't really work, and I'm frustrated.\" And so I'm, I just always think about that in general. Like, if I'm trying to build any kind of habit on my team, it's less about, like, the accountability of, like, how I'm forcing this and more about, like, how I make it so rewarding for people to do it that they do it naturally.\n\nI wrote down notes as you were talking. So, kind of the four parts of habits, and I want to, I'm going to ask you for an example to help people see how this actually works in real life. But basically, to help people build an actual habit, the three steps are: consist, the three things you want to focus on: consistency, friction, and reward loop. And within reward loop, you want it to be powerful, immediate, and emotional.\n\nWhat is an example of this?\n\nYeah, I can give some examples of, like, how we do this in product, if that would be interesting.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nUm, because I think this is something WHOOP is really good at. So I think one of the most interesting kind of anti-reward loops on WHOOP is around alcohol. Um, WHOOP has this recovery system. Uh, you get a recovery score every morning. It's red, yellow, and green. And it's basically, like, how recovered you are and how ready you are to take on the day. And if you drink and you're on WHOOP, you will very quickly learn that if you anytime you drink, you get a red recovery. And it's so interesting because it's not like people who were drinking weren't getting hangovers before, or, like, they weren't, like, they knew that it was disrupting their sleep. Like, none of this is news for people, but there's something about seeing that, like, red score that just feels like it just feels bad. It has, like, this really profound emotional impact on people. And when you see the green score, it feels great. It's like, \"Oh, I'm, like, I'm doing something well. Like, I'm taking care of myself. I'm a healthy person,\" and you, I hear this when I talk to members all the time, and I hear people say, \"Uh, I've been, you know, I've had problems with drinking for years, and it wasn't until I got on WHOOP that I was really able to get a handle on my drinking,\" and I'm always again kind of, like, amazed by this because I'm like, \"You had all the information you needed before,\" but there's something about the, like, you wake up and you get that red score that's just, like, it manages to override, like, whatever was driving people to do it in the first place. And then I think continuing to, like, have that data where you can look back at your data, you can see, \"Oh, that was the red day, that was the day that I did this thing.\" Um, and it's something that we've actually been trying to, uh, you know, find ways to do this in a longer-term way, because when you have these short reward loops, it's easier, where it's like, \"I did a thing, and then I immediately either got a reward, green recovery, or got an anti-reward, red recovery,\" and that is changing my behavior as a result. And we have this new feature, Hellspan, that, uh, we just launched with our new hardware. And basically, what it's trying to do is help you have this reward loop between your behaviors and activities that you're doing today and what that means for how healthy you're going to be in, you know, 20, 30, 40 years. And so we have something similar where we have this, uh, we call it the amoeba. Um, it has your WHOOP age in it. It's, like, it has colors and sort of kind of moves around. And that changes based on how your behaviors and your activities change every single day. And the colors change when you're doing better and when you're doing worse. Uh, and you can kind of see it all broken down: how you sleep, your VO₂ max, the consistency of your sleep, uh, how much time you're spending in different heart rate zones, how much time you're spending strength training, things like that. Um, and we found that, again, it's just this incredibly powerful reward loop because we're taking something that historically has been really, really hard, which is, like, when I make healthy changes today, not only do I not see the results of those for decades, but the short-term reward loop of those often feels pretty bad because change is hard, and it feels bad before it feels good. And trying to, like, build that reward loop that is more rewarding for people to see those numbers change and to see those colors change, um, so that they're actually able to make those changes and see that progress and feel really good about it.\n\nI love that you're using all these, uh, habit-building tactics that folks have been using historically to get you to check your Instagram likes and your Facebook posts, uh, for actual good, for helping people live longer and happier. Uh, that makes me very happy. Is there an example of doing this sort of thing with your team of helping them build, and you talk about AI, like learning to use, you know, cloud GPT?\n\nYeah, I think, I mean, with AI, I think a lot of it is just shouting people out, right? Like, when, uh, when somebody is doing the, like, using AI to solve a problem that they wouldn't have used AI before, like, give them a shout-out in the team meeting. Let them demo that. Like, again, make them feel like a million bucks for doing the thing, and people respond to that. Like, people will see. I mean, maybe it's because I work at WHOOP, and we're all obsessed with reward loops, so we're all, like, forward-looping each other. \"Here's your reward.\" No, exactly. But no, like, like, people see that, and people respond to it. Um, I think, you know, another example is, like, something that I think about a lot and is relevant to our conversation about, um, just, like, how you build teams that can do hard things is, uh, how you encourage people to take care of themselves outside of work. And it's something that, like, I'm always trying to model for my team and make it really visible, the ways that I'm doing this, um, and sort of, like, having my hobbies and my other various things. And as a result, I also try to reward, like, have these reward loops when I see people on my team doing the same thing, because I think people, bosses often inadvertently create reward loops for, like, \"Oh, this person, you know, they had to stay up till 2 o'clock to get it done, but they got it done.\" And when you create those reward loops, that's the behavior that people start mimicking. And so I, you know, I try to do the opposite. Like, I try to, uh, find ways that I, I really am impressed with my team and the ways that they take care of themselves outside of work, because I, I think that makes them better at their jobs, frankly, and just happier humans. And so, like, there's a PM on my team, Emily, who, uh, teaches at The Handle Bar. She's a fitness instructor in her spare time. And so whenever we have, like, a long meeting, I'll be like, \"Oh, Emily, why don't you, like, lead stretches, uh, to get, like, the energy level in the room up, just, like, you know, nothing serious, just for a minute, um, before we start the meeting.\" And it's kind of fun. Everyone has a laugh about it. Like, Emily's doing her thing. And I'll be like, \"You know, everyone, everyone come check out Emily at, uh, The Handle Bar in Boston this Saturday, 10 a.m.\" And by the way, like, you all out there in the podcast world should do that if you're in the Boston area. She's great. Uh, shout-out to Emily. But it's things like that. Like, it's just, it's just finding these small ways to, like, because people are already laughing. People are already smiling. We're doing this silly thing. Everyone's in a good mood. And I'm like, \"Boom, perfect time to give someone a shout-out and make them feel like a million bucks for doing something that in many cases they might think, like, 'Oh, am I allowed to have this other job outside work? Like, is this okay?'\" And so yeah, you got to, you got to, like, proactively build those reward loops.\n\nI love the reward loop of Emily getting this shout-out right now. This is so meta.\n\nhave a full class coming up in Boston.\n\nIs there anything else along those lines? Because that was really interesting. And also, people, like, you know, I know managers already kind of do this, just like, you know, promoting, but so I think the core lesson here is, like, focus on things you want to encourage more, less so, \"Hey, they worked the weekend, they got it done, so awesome, thank you for doing that.\" Uh, you know, you're saying that's almost an anti-pattern, because you don't necessarily want that as a habit. So it's more like shift your reward announcements to things you actually intentionally want to create.\n\nYeah. Just, just be really, really thoughtful about it. Okay, so let's come back to the taking care of yourself, because this is something else that came up, almost everyone mentioned this. So you're doing a good job with this of finding time to take care of yourself and modeling that for other people. Uh, specifically, a lot of people commented on how you create, you create space for creativity.\n\nAnd I think to a lot of people, a lot of PMs, especially, is just like, \"I have no time for anything. I just have meetings back-to-back all day. I barely have time to go to the bathroom or eat.\" And, uh, I'm curious to hear just how you do this. How do you create space in your day for creative work and deep work and thinking outside of the meeting?\n\nYeah, it's funny. I'm glad to hear people think I'm good at this, because I'm, like, I'm terrible at, like, organizing events. Like, my team's always like, \"Oh, we should do, like, a fun event.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, that's a great idea.\" And then I, I don't organize it. So I, I like to think I do this in other ways. Uh, and I do think one of them is just, like, in modeling how to carve out space for things. And a couple things, I think there's the creativity, which for me is, like, probably more outside of work, and for me, it's creativity, but again, it's, like, a big part of me as a manager, what I think I can help people with is back to the point of behavioral activation, like, understanding what the things are that a person needs to be happy, to be their best self, to be a high-functioning person, and that is, that depends on their values, it depends on a lot of things about them. So, you know, for Emily, it's fitness, it's teaching, it's these things. Uh, for me, it's having, like, my, uh, my crafts that I do, my illustration, my writing, my reading, all of these sorts of things. Um, I think that that's the first step is just, as a leader, like, understanding what those are for people on your team.\n\nAnd then, as I said, modeling it, like, I, I try to always tell people, like, \"Here, here's how I'm doing these things.\" Like, I talk about them, so it's really normalized, because I think, I mean, a lot of PMs are, like, \"Oh, my gosh, I'm so busy, I have no time in meetings all day.\" But, like, that's a little bit self-inflicted, I think. Like, you, at some point, like, you have to be the one responsible for getting yourself out of the weeds. Um, and it's hard to do, but it, it is, it's doable. Um, and so I think just, like, showing people that it's possible, like, showing people that you, you can do these things, and I, I talk about them, and I bring them to lessons. I have, like, a book club that I sometimes require at work, and then I say, \"Maybe I don't need to require this anymore.\" Um, but, like, like, ways to just make it really visible, make people, make sure people know that I'm doing it, and then ask them about it. And, you know, if I, in my one-on-ones, and I'm checking in with people, I'm asking them, like, \"What, what do you do for joy? Like, are you doing something every single day that's bringing you joy in your life?\" And if they say no, I'm like, \"That's a problem. Like, how, what are we going to do about that?\" And, like, what do you, do you even know what those things are? Because I think a lot of people don't. And, like, a lot of people, it's great, like, they're like, \"Oh, I need to be getting x number of hours of exercise, x hours of sleep.\" Uh, like, I know I need to eat lunch right at 12, or else I turn into a pumpkin. Um, and if, if it's somebody who, like, knows what all those things are, and you're just there to kind of help them carve out time, that's one thing, but I think in a lot of times, like, people don't even know, and then, and then you kind of behavioral activate them, where you're like, \"All right, well, why don't you try some things and get back to me and, like, let me know what, what seemed to work, what seemed to make a difference.\" But I do think so much of it is, like, a permission structure, because people feel the pressure to be, like, \"Oh, I'm so busy. I'm so busy. I'm in meetings all day. I can't, I can't decline these meetings. I can't not do these things.\" And so, in many ways, I think just modeling it gives them the permission structure to, to start to take back their life.\n\nI could see why people love working for you. Being asked in your one-on-one, \"Have you done anything today that brings you joy?\" And if you haven't, that's a problem.\n\nWow. It's important. You know, it's like, that's what life's all about. Like, why are we here if it's just to toil and be miserable? And also, like, you know, they will be better people at work, and they will do better at work. I think that's, like, tell me, correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels like that's an element of this, well, and it, you know, it's so funny, because so much of this stuff, it's, like, obvious when you apply it to an athletic context. Uh, and obviously, you know, I talked about the, like, recovery score, uh, this concept of, like, athletes need to recover is very obvious. Like, no one, I think, would argue with that. Uh, if you're just pushing yourself at 100% of your physical capacity all the time, like, not only are you going to burn out, but, like, you're literally going to suffer performance decline. Um, and you\n\n\nI know,\nin the same way, like I think in the\nathletic world, there's so much more\njust acceptance of,\nuh,\nI don't even want to say limits, but\njust like\nyou have to take the time to do the\nthings you need to be your best.\nAnd that's not just running into the wall\nall day.\nUm, and I think we forget that\nat work, but I think I mean the analog\nis 100% there.\nI also think about this\nwith um\nin terms of being able to have creative\nbreakthroughs of any kind.\nIt's just so\nimportant to have active rest.\nIt's so\nimportant to have heads down time.\nLike\nthis stuff is all very well documented.\nWe know it all.\nUm but we just come up\nwith excuses to like not give it to\nourselves.\nI think it's it's kind of\nself-sabotaged at a certain point.\nI\ndefinitely come up with excuses not to\ndo that and work all the time.\nSo I\ncould use this advice myself.\nMe too.\nThat's And that's why here's the thing.\nHere's the thing.\nThe reason I'm so\nregimented about this is because like if\nI'm not, I will fall apart.\nLike there's\nthis quote, I can't remember where where\nI saw this, but I love it.\nIt's like,\nyou know, I have exercise the demons\nfrom my head, but they are outside and\nthey are doing push-ups.\nLike the threat\nof the demons coming back is always\nthere.\nAnd so, like, I take this stuff\nreally seriously because I know like I\nif I'm not if if I let myself start to\nslide into like I'm not doing the things\nI need to do to take care of myself,\nlike I'm going to have a bad time.\nThe\nwalls are are going to start closing in\naround me.\nAnd I'm not I'm not like shy\nabout that.\nAnd so to me, there's no\npoint in torturing myself and like just\nworking so so so hard and having no room\nfor joy and having no room for\ncreativity even just from a practical\nstandpoint.\nLike it's not I'm not I'm\njust not going to succeed.\nSo this comes\nback to your point about I think it was\ncalled behavioral activation of like\ndoing the thing instead of waiting for\nyou to feel a certain feeling.\nDo the\nthing that will make you feel that way.\nYep.\nOkay.\nUh as maybe a final area, but\nI have a few more questions after this,\nso maybe not the final area is AI.\nUh I\nI'm uh happy that we waited this long to\nget deep into AI.\nWe're not going to\nspend a lot of time here.\nYou wrote a\nwhole guest post about this.\nYou did how\nI AI to talk through some of this stuff,\nbut I when we were talking earlier, you\nsaid that you think people still are\ncompletely undervaluing the power AI can\nhave on their ability to learn and\nimprove themselves.\nAnd I know you spent\na lot of time on this with all these\nGPTs you've built.\nJust talk about the\nsense of how much you think people still\nunderappreciate how much power there is\nin AI and helping them become better.\nYeah, I think we are not being nearly\ncreative enough when it comes to how to\nthink about learning with AI.\nAnd I\nthink you know you hear people\nworry about entry- level jobs.\nAnd when\nyou think about an entry-level job, it\nis sort of uh inefficient by design\nbecause you have like take an analyst\nsort of a classic entry-le role.\nThey're\nthey're doing grunt work.\nThey're doing\nreally tedious work.\nUm but they're\ngetting a lot of reps in because that's\nexactly how you learn the judgment to do\nhigher level jobs well.\nAnd I hear this\nin creative fields too.\nI hear this like\nfrom every I certainly feel this way\nlike the work that I did in the\nbeginning of my career.\nUh it was it it\ndidn't feel like it was all that um\nimportant in terms of the impact it was\nhaving.\nUh but it did feel like it was\ntransformative in terms of my own\njudgment and my own taste and how I\nthink about like just making like very\nquick judgment calls now.\nI just\nwouldn't have been able to do that if I\ndidn't spend years learning like you\nknow I used I used to do social media\nlike the skill of having to condense\nsomething that I want to say into like\n120 characters or whatever it used to be\non old Twitter 240 I can't remember I\nforget actually was that crazy like I\nforget what the original was I think it\nwas 140 okay 140 140 it was it was short\nand you got if you had to get a link in\nthere like good luck to you but oh my\ngosh the my ability to just like look at\na something written today and just cut\nit that text in half, third, like\nwhatever it needs to fill the space like\nI can I can do that in my sleep because\nI got all these reps very early in my\ncareer.\nAnd so I think people see the\nway that uh you know there's a threat of\ncompanies not wanting to hire as much\nentry-level talent because um you know\nit's like oh this is the kind of work\nthat AI can do.\nAnd so the fear that I\nhear at least is um where if you're not\ngetting those reps early in your career,\nlike maybe it's not contributing so much\nvalue to the company at that moment, but\nit's it's how you learn to be great\nlater on.\nAnd so there's a fear that in\n5 10 years like we're just not going to\nhave that that class of people who have\nlearned to do the jobs well and who have\nbuilt judgment in that way.\nBut what I\nthink that misses is it assumes that you\nknow you go and you do this analyst job\nfor two years and at the end of it you\nhave a person who uh knows how to make\nmodels really well, knows how to do a\nfew things really well.\nBut like why\ndoes that have to take two years?\nAnd\nwhy does that model of like you you\ngrind over this thing, you wait for\nfeedback, eventually you get that\nfeedback, maybe that feedback's good,\nmaybe it's not.\nUm you go back, you try\nagain, like it it actually is really\ninefficient when you think about it.\nAnd\nthe sort of learning applications around\nAI that I get really excited about are\nhow do you shrink that loop?\nSo in my\npodcast with Claire, I showed her how\nlike I build these GPTs that kind of\nthink like me and the purpose of that is\nso that my team can get feedback that is\nat least 80% close to the feedback that\nI would be giving them.\nBut instead of\nhaving to wait until I get to their\nmessage or until our one-on-one, they\ncan get that on demand as many times as\nthey want, you know, forever.\nAnd I\nthink there's a lot of things like this\nof like ways that things that require\nother people just naturally slow things\ndown, require getting feedback from\nother people just naturally slow things\ndown.\nWe can build AI tools that like\nyou know in my view there's no reason\nwhy the amount of reps that you get at\nwhatever task you're doing like you can\nbe a you can be a film editor just like\nsitting there pouring over the film uh\ndeciding like what to edit, what to cut,\nwhat to you know put into the trailer or\nwhatever it is you're making.\nThat's an\nincredibly tedious job that takes\nforever.\nAnd I think there's no reason\nwe can't like make that way more\nefficient with AI in way is that make\nthe learning like more fun.\nUm and so I\njust yeah I think that that's sort of my\nhot take is uh yes it is like there is\nthis threat of a lot of these jobs that\nare things that seem like you can just\nautomate them away that might happen but\nlike we absolutely still need to be\ninvesting in people's skills.\nI just\ndon't think we need to be investing in\nthem historically in the way that we\nalways have.\nAnd I think in the future\nwe'll find that those ways actually seem\nseem quite inefficient compared to what\nwhat's possible today.\nIt's such a\npowerful point and we're already seeing\nthis.\nI imagine you've seen these\nstudies I think it's in Nigeria uh where\nthey give students AI tutors and they\njust like zoom to the next they they\naccelerate so quickly in their\nprogression of just like reading and\nmath.\nI think like we're already seeing\nit and and it's harder to measure in PM\nand product and all these things but\nlike in school it's a lot easier to\nmeasure and we're already seeing results\nthere.\nYeah.\n100%.\nAnd to make this very\nreal for people you have this specific\nGPT I think it's called Socrates or what\nwhat Aristotle.\nYeah.\nAristotle.\nOkay.\nOh no.\nWe got to edit that out.\nAristotle.\nAristotle.\nUh where it gives\nyou scenarios in a product scenario like\nor like give an example just to give\npeople a sense of what this can do.\nYes.\nSo this came from I was talking earlier\nabout learning how to make a really\nstrong logical argument uh or just like\na strong argument for your point of view\nin general.\nAnd the sort of fundamental\nskill for that in my view is logical\nthinking, logical reasoning.\nAnd when I\nthink about like the best way we have to\ntest that today, uh, at least like the\nbest is maybe not the right word, but\nthe standard way we have to test that,\nthe LSAT, like this, the test that you\ntake to get into law school, that is\nwhat that tests and it sort of gives you\nthese different scenarios and we'll try\nto say like, you know, if A is true,\nthen which of the following is true is\nnot true, like sort of testing some of\nthese different like logical\nrelationships.\nAnd so what I did was I\nmade a GPT that I basically told it like\ncreate ELSAT style questions uh to to\ntest logical reasoning but put them in\nthe scenarios of things that a PM would\nencounter.\nAnd I have like a version of\nthis that's very specific to WHOOP and\nworking in consumer health, but you\ncould do it for anything or you can just\ndo generic, you know, however you want\nto do it.\nAnd it's actually like it's\nkind of fun because it it gives you the\nscenario and it's like um you know\nyou're\nthe sales team is telling you that uh we\nneed to invest in feature A and the uh I\ndon't know the engineering team is\ntelling you that we only have time to do\nfeature B and uh the metrics are telling\nyou that um you know people who get this\nfeature retain better like it just sort\nof gives do these little things and it's\nlike follow that logic which is the\nwhich is the logically best path from\nthis and it gives you a little multiple\nchoice answer.\nYou select one and then\nexplains why you're right or wrong.\nAnd\nso I think that's just like another\nexample of, you know, you can't you\ncan't create those like\nhyperpersonalized learnings where I can\nmake one that is like literally so\nspecific to you and your life.\nUm, but\nis like testing and sort of like\ntraining you on this like broader skill\nset.\nAnd I think you can, you know, you\ncan make things more fun that way.\nEven\nin just like the school context in terms\nof doing that in a way that's just\nrelevant to a person's interest,\nrelevant to the things they care about.\nUm, I think there's a ton of really\ninteresting potential there, too.\nSo,\nwe're going to link to this GPT that\nyou're talking about that that people\ncan try out and once you see it, you're\nlike, &quot;Holy I I should just be\ndoing this all the time because you just\nget so many reps as a as a product\nbuilder.&quot;\nUh, and that's, you know, we\nwe were talking about a similar one uh\nwith like understanding engineering\nbenchmarks.\nI don't have an engineering\nbackground.\nSo, this was really hard for\nme like when I was moving into product\nis just getting an instinct for what\ntypes of things tend to be easier or\nharder for engineering teams.\nUm, and so\nwe can have one similar that's saying,\nuh, you know, like here's the scope\nthat's being proposed.\nIf you had to\nt-shirt size this, like which one would\nyou choose and why?\nAnd you can say, oh,\nyou know, this sounds small or whatever.\nAnd it'll say, oh, actually, like these\ntypes of integrations tend to be complex\nfor these reasons, so it's probably\ngoing to end up being more like a large.\nand you know it doesn't have enough\ncontext to like really like inform you\nin the way that uh you know your your\ntech stack at your company is.\nAlthough\nI guess you could build it and give it\nthat information and then it would that\nwould be cool.\nYou should do that.\nBut\nagain it's like you do that like as a PM\nyou might get a chance to do that I\ndon't know a couple times a week maybe\nmaybe less often than that.\nAnd when you\nhave this little tool you can do it\ninfinity times.\nyou can do it, you know,\nyou can spend an afternoon doing it.\nAnd\nso again, like both the speed of those\nloops and the like the number of those\nloops that you're able to get is just\nlike radically different with AI\ncompared to just like when they come up\nin the course of your job.\nI I think\nthis is extremely cool.\nUh we're going\nto link to it.\nPeople should definitely\nplay with this.\nOkay, I'm going to take us to two\ncorners recurring segments of the\npodcast and then I want to talk about\nWHOOP uh before we get to a very\nexciting lightning round.\nSo, this is a\nnew segment I'm trying out.\nI'm going to\ncall it pivot pivotal corner.\nAnd here's\nthe question.\nWhat's the most pivotal\nmoment in your career?\nI mean, I think\nit was at my at my former company um at\nBig Health when I uh my former boss left\nthe company and I started reporting into\nthe CEO.\nAnd again, I think it was my\nfirst time just having like up close uh\nlike working with a CEO so closely and\nit just like\ndefinitely trial by fire.\nUh but it it\nmade me understand so many things that\nseemed like they didn't make sense to me\nbefore when I was just like in the rank\nand file of like a big tech company\nearlier in my career.\nYou get in the\nroom and you talk to these people and\nyou're like, &quot;Oh, this like this\nactually makes sense.\nIt's like I\nunderstand why this person has come to\nthese conclusions.\nUm, and some of it's\nlike understanding the pressure they're\nunder.\nSome of it's understanding again\nlike the the way they view the world.\nUm, but I think that was, you know, to\nget to our our earlier point around like\nthe humility of understanding that like\nmaybe this person is right about\nsomething that I don't see and maybe I\ncan start by if I start by giving them\nthe benefit of the doubt, it is not only\nlike a a nice thing to do, but it is\nalso like it will get me it will help me\nunderstand why they're doing the things\nthat they are.\nAnd I think I would have\nbeen so much less frustrated earlier in\nmy career if I understood that instead\nof just being like, &quot;Ah, this doesn't\nmake any sense from where I'm sitting,\nso therefore it must not make any\nsense.&quot;\nThat's so cool that this\nconnects back to your habit of doing\nthis, having seen it, and being like,\n&quot;Oh, I see.\nThis is why I guess maybe\nI'm wrong.\nMaybe I could be wrong.&quot;\nWell, that's I mean, that's what it is.\nLike I feel like I've had so many of\n\n\nThose times where, like, I don't know.\nOh, when I was growing up, I was just so, like, I felt so confident in, like, how I felt about everything.\nAnd then you get, and you get out there, and you're just like, \"Oh, I was, I was missing some things.\"\nAnd after a while, you're kind of like, \"Okay, maybe I should, maybe I should approach these situations a little differently with the, with the possibility that maybe I'm missing something.\"\nSo, I actually asked your boss, Kelvin, which is an awesome name, by the way, Kelvin, uh, about this moment.\nWhen I asked him what to ask you, and he brought this up, actually, and here's the way he described it.\nShe may describe it as being thrown into the deep end or baptism by fire.\nBut the reality is that she had the core skills, and this was simply an opportunity for her to let those shine even more.\nShe, she was an incredible first principles thinker, quick to tune the framing of problems as she learned more context.\nIt's a great example of luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\nThanks, Ka.\nThat's her.\nUh, he also said, \"I wonder if she remembers how terrified she was now because she absolutely knocked it out of the park.\"\nAnd I felt, it felt like it was an inflection point that grew her confidence significantly.\nOh, I was terrified.\nUh, yeah, big time terrified.\nAnd that, I mean, this is also, like, what, what I was saying about, uh, why it's so important to, like, be regimented about having these things outside of work that allow you to continue to thrive even in the face of just, like, utter feelings of failure of, like, I am not doing a good job.\nThis is not going well.\nI don't know what I'm doing.\nUm, you know, a lot of it was that time Kelman actually gave me some great advice that was, uh, that this is maybe kind of scary advice, but when I asked him, uh, what his advice for me at the time was, and he said, product leadership is a the type of role where if you are not in control of the voices in your head, they will eat you alive.\nAnd you know, I think it's right.\nLike, I, as I said, it is so often this, like, feeling like there is not a clear right answer, and not even necessarily a good answer, and everyone is looking to you for clarity, and everyone is looking to you to make the right decisions, and everyone sees the errors, or at least, like, everyone can spot the flaws in whatever decision you make or whatever recommendation you make.\nAnd you know, you, as I said, like, every path forward has flaws that can be poked in it.\nAnd so understanding that, like, the existence of potential ways to be criticized about something does not, does not warrant criticism in a way that, like, can, I think, often result in a lot of negative self-talk for people.\nSo, yeah, I mean, it had a tremendous impact on me.\nIt's interesting how so much of these habits and skills you've built seem to, like, it's clear where they come from from all these experiences that you had.\nWell, and to the point of, like, when you, when you start talking to people and you start trying to build this mental model of how they think, like, that's exactly what you learn, right?\nIs, well, I can see how this person kind of, you know, worked at this company at this time, and I can see how this person had this kind of relationship with this other person, and, like, all of these things shape the way that we approach problems and the way that we try to, you know, just move through the world, and it is, like, it, it is understanding those types of things that allow you to understand how a person thinks.\nI wonder if you could ask GPT to build or CLA to build these mental models, like, here's their LinkedIn, here's their bio, here's a few things.\nWhat's, how do they see the world?\nI will admit that I have tried this, and I think it, I think, I think it's a great idea.\nI think it does help.\nI have not gotten to a point where I'm, like, comfortable sharing it with other people.\nUh, nor have I told anyone that I have tried to do this for them, but I've certainly done it for myself.\nUh, and I think it would be helpful because, because you could say things like, you could upload a, you know, doc or whatever and be like, what are the three questions that this person's going to ask me about it?\nUh, and then you could be prepared for the questions that that person's going to ask you.\nAnd that's great.\nUh, in this hypothetical example, what do you, what do you context do you share with with this model to help it be good?\nGreat question.\nUh, hypothetically, uh, you know, I told you that I take all these notes on, here's what this person said, and here's how I interpret it, and LLMs are really good at pattern matching and sort of spotting the, like, you could, you could feed all of those in and just say, you know, come up with the, the, like, 10 criteria that this person is most likely to use to, uh, assess a possible recommendation or path forward.\nUm, or give me, like, the top 10 ways that this person is, uh, likely to pick apart an argument or object to something, and it, you're going to get a good answer.\nMore reason to build this habit of taking notes and sharing with your team.\nOn the other hand, this might also be a good use case for granola or something like that where you have all these meeting notes and you could just feed it.\nHere's all the things Hillary said, and oh, what is she, what is she probably going to say about this?\nTotally.\nWow.\nSo cool.\nOkay, next corner, I'm going to take us to fail corner.\nAnd in fail corner, the idea here is people come on this podcast, they share all these wins and success.\nEverything's up and to the right and amazing, but in reality, things don't always go that smoothly.\nSo the question is just, is there a story you could share of failure in your career where things didn't go the way you hoped and what you learned from that experience?\nUm, I mean, I think the one that probably, uh, looms largest in my mind is, I'm, you know, I mentioned this, uh, depression therapeutic that, uh, I spent about a year working on, and, uh, ultimately the company ended up acquiring a different depression therapeutic.\nUm, and we kind of ended up, like, merging the two of them.\nAnd a lot of the stuff that we had initially built that I would have really loved about this product we were working on didn't really ever end up seeing the light of day beyond the kind of testing that we had done around it.\nAnd it was heartbreaking because, like, I still, I wish this product existed.\nLike, I look at it and I'm like, this was a great product, and we put so much heart and soul into it.\nAnd I think the, like, the lesson that I learned from that is, um, I think there's, there's always a shot clock, right?\nWhen you're working, especially on a zero to one product, I think it can be very easy to feel like you have the luxury of time of just, like, you know, we got to, we, like, we got to take the time to figure this out and get it right, and that's what's most important.\nUm, but the, the sort of build versus buy question is always live, and it's always fair.\nAnd whether you want to admit it, if you're the one working on it, and you probably don't, I, I didn't want to admit this.\nUm, there is a point at which, like, it, it makes more sense for the company, like, if it is taking too long to develop something and there is a solution out there that works, like, it is the right decision to acquire that.\nAnd I mean, I've worked at Dropbox for a while.\nI saw this happen all the time where we would, like, acquire products that other teams internally had been working on, and it's just like, it's kind of heartbreaking when it happens.\nBut I think there's, like, an urgency that that has instilled in me that I think is actually really good and healthy.\nUm, especially again, like, working in this era where there is kind of this AI arms race and everyone's trying to move really quickly of, like, yeah, there's, there's always a shot clock, and you might not be aware of it, but it's there.\nUh, and you gotta, you got to build your heart out, and you got to ship, and you got to get things out because, uh, at any time, like, that clock might run out.\nSpeaking of shock clock, not necessarily, but, uh, I want to spend a little time on WHOOP.\nThe you guys just launched something, uh, that's feels like a really big deal.\nI'm excited.\nThat's the reason I got it.\nThere's all these really cool new features.\nUh, I think you call WHOOP 5.0.\nWhat should people know?\nWhat's the newest, coolest thing that's happening with WHOOP?\nYeah, I'm really excited you got it.\nI know, I know you tried it before, and That's right.\nThat's right.\nPeople who have tried WHOOP in the past maybe felt like it was, like, very focused on, like, elite athletes, and that is likely company.\nAnd I think what we've, what we've done with our new experience is, uh, we've really built something that can help everyone be healthier and live better.\nUm, I think we're, I would say we're no longer just for elite athletes.\nLike, we're really now, like, a, a health and performance companion for anybody who wants to feel their best.\nUm, for the first time in our company's mission or history, we've updated our mission.\nSo, we're now saying that WHOOP exists to unlock human performance and health span.\nUm, and health span, I think is, I mentioned earlier this feature I'm really excited about because I do think it's, it is kind of the most powerful version of, like, a longevity type feature I have seen because it is so focused on your behaviors and your habits today.\nAnd we built it to be super, super actionable.\nSo rather than just, like, giving you a score that you're kind of like, \"Okay, that's nice.\"\nIf you start sleeping even, like, 20 minutes more, 30 minutes more tonight, like, you're going to see how that changes your pace of aging, you're going to see how that changes your age.\nUm, and I think that, as I mentioned earlier, I think is really rewarding.\nWe've also have a lot of personalized coaching to our AI in terms of actions that you can take to improve your WHOOPage, uh, to improve your sleep, to feel better.\nUm, and it's all part of our broader aim to make health more actionable and accessible.\nI think one thing I'm really excited about is we have a bunch of new, uh, women's health features.\nSo, we have, uh, hormonal insights with improved menstrual cycle tracking.\nUh, I'm actually pregnant, and I What?\nI didn't know that.\nA big announcement.\nWow.\nCongratulations, Hilary.\nThat's so exciting.\nUh, but I actually, I part of how I found out I was pregnant was in seeing my WHOOP data.\nWhat?\nSeeing it in my data.\nWhat is remarkable, and the way that we have this, the cycle tracking now, you can see the way that your different, um, you know, your HRV, your resting heart rate, things like that.\nThat's your heart rate variability and your resting heart rate fluctuates throughout different times of your cycle.\nAnd, and even in, like, the time leading up to that, like, I had a not straightforward pregnancy journey.\nAnd having these tools to, like, really understand what was going on in my body was tremendously helpful and, and tremendously, like, empowering for me, and, and honestly, really has changed my life.\nSo I'm really excited about that.\nWe have a lot of great new, uh, heart health features.\nWe have a heart health screener, uh, with blood pressure insights and ECG.\nThat's really cool.\nUm, we got a lot of, a lot of great stuff cooking.\nSo, even if you've tried WHOOP in the past and thought it wasn't for you, um, I think the, the new experience is a real upgrade, and it's, it's something that I'm, I'm deeply proud of having worked on, um, and really excited to have out in the world.\nI am generally very excited about this.\nLike, you could do, uh, you said blood pressure and VO₂ max.\nIt's, and, and I know the battery is even longer, too.\nThere's just, like, so much.\nWe have a 14-day battery life.\nI didn't even say we have these beautiful new leather bands, which Oh, wow.\n14-day batteries life is, is insane.\nLike, I'm going on vacation tomorrow, and I'm like, I don't even need to bring a charger.\nLike, this is fantastic.\nOh man, like, this sounds like a WHOOP ad, but I'm, like, very excited about this.\nI will say one more thing, which is we also have, um, we've opened a weight list for WHOOP Advanced Labs, and so pretty soon you're going to be able to have, like, comprehensive lab work, uh, in the in the app.\nAnd I think, you know, we talk about the future of health of having, like, control of all of your health data in one place and then being able to, like, not just sort of find the signal in it and, and sort of understand, like, you know, how your sleep is impacting your metabolic health or things like that, but again, get really actionable coaching on actions that you can take to, to feel better and be your healthiest.\nUm, and yeah, just pushing, pushing the limits of all the data that that we're pulling into the WHOOP ecosystem.\nSo really excited about that, too.\nI'm hoping the WHOOP can actually take my blood and labs.\nIs that, was that where this is going?\nBecause that'd be so convenient.\nNo comment.\nOkay, that'd be like, it'd be weird, but also awesome.\nI'd have to go anywhere to do that.\nUh, Hilary, we covered so much ground.\nOkay, before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on?\nAnything else that we haven't covered that you think or or last nugget you wanted to leave listeners with?\nI don't think so.\nI feel like we covered everything.\nWe did.\nWe covered so much, uh, in the best way possible.\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\nUh, are you ready?\nI'm ready.\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\nUh, Bunny, you can't call something a lightning round and then ask me about books.\nThat's like, we could, we could go for a whole other podcast where I'm create a time box for it.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nLightning round.\nOkay.\nI'm gonna go, you know what I'm gonna say?\nI'm like, uh, I'm gonna go full fiction on this.\nI'm gonna say, if you're going to read a book, like, you don't bother reading a business book.\nLike, I even the business books I love the most that, like, shaped how I think, I'm like, I kind of got the gist of them partway through.\nBut fiction, I'm like, everybody should read East of Eden by John Steinbeck, and everybody should read The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway.\nUh, it is, like, my comfort book.\nI think I, like, what I love about fiction is it just, it teaches you how to sit inside tension, right?\nI think\n\n\nSo much of working in product is, as I said, like you're in this fog, and you just have to provide clarity, and you have to be really good at like providing structure to ambiguous things and finding the way forward. To succeed at the job, you have to be able to do that, but I also think to succeed as a human in the job, you have to be able to sit in the mess and sit in the ambiguity. Um, John Keats, the poet, talks about this concept of negative capability, which is the ability to remain in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason. And I love that. It sounds like a perfect quote for all PMs to. Exactly. And it's like, you've got to be built right again, fiction. I love dualities. There's a lot of dualities in fiction, a lot of like warring forces within a people that is like, you know, can be so driving for people, but can also be the source of so much anguish. Um, I think it's important to live in both. I'm going to break down this problem. I'm going to structure it. I'm going to get out. But also, like, I'm going to sit here, and I'm going to accept that there is no right answer, and there is no perfect answer, and I, I, that's life. So, you know, you don't learn that from, to the extent that you learn that from a book at all, which maybe you don't. Uh, but I think you can, I think you can learn it in fiction. I don't know how you feel about this book. I think you'll be proud of me. I'm reading Anna Karenina right now.\n\nOh, I was, I literally, I, that's the book that I'm bringing on vacation with me tomorrow. Wow. So, you never, you've never read it? I've never read it. Cool. Me neither. Okay. Well, we'll exchange some notes. It's very long. I'm, I'm relaxing because I'm reading on the Kindle, like only 12%. Okay. Now, now I really have to read it. I was like kind of wavering. I was like, \"Is this weirdly what I'm gonna want to read when I'm like sitting by the pool?\" But I've come, you got to do it. Another guest recommended it, and I saw it on some lists recently, and I'm like, \"Oh, I should read that.\" So, yeah. Okay, great. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed? Oh. Um, I've been watching The Rehearsal with Nathan Fielder. Have you seen the show? I saw the first season. I've been a huge fan of Nathan Fielder for so long. I don't know if you saw his previous thing that he did. I forget what it's called. Okay. He's so hilarious and such a genius. Nathan for you. Oh my god. Uh, I haven't seen the new season though. The man is a freaky genius. Like, I just, when I thought that I had like a good sense of all the human emotions that exist out there, like I watch the show and I feel things that I'm like, I have no, I feel like 10 different things, and I'm like, I have no words any of the things that I'm feeling right now. Uh, it's, it's weird. It's weird stuff, but I'm enjoying it. I got to watch it. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really enjoyed other than the WHOOP?\n\nI love my Zift. Zift, it's like a program that you can hook up a smart trainer to, like, for an indoor cycling situation. Uh, and you kind of bike around like you're in Mario Kart, and you're sort of in these virtual worlds biking with other people. Uh, it's, I think, for very serious cyclists. I am not a very serious cyclist. For me, it's been amazing as somebody who actually really like struggles to find time to exercise. Um, I like they have speak of reward loops, they have one of the most amazing reward loops, which is you're biking along, and you, you get into this like, um, track, and a ghost of your previous self breaks out from you and starts racing alongside you at like your personal best for that track, and you have to beat your personal self, or you have to beat this ghost version of yourself. And like, nothing has ever motivated me more in my life than like past Hillary being like, \"I'm coming for you.\" And I'm like, I don't get that competitive with other people, but like past Hillary comes for me, and I'm like, this, I can't let happen. So, I, I think it's a great product. I'm thinking about how to use that tech, that, uh, I don't know, mode for other use cases, like the ghost version of something to motivate you. I've, I've been in so many product meetings where I'm like, \"Can we make like a, like a ghost version of yourself?\"\n\nLike, shut up about the ghost.\n\nOkay. Amazing. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life? I've, I'll say one that's been top of mind for me recently. Uh, because I was talking about the highbrow fiction, I also have to go lowbrow. I saw this, uh, clip of Beavis and Butthead online recently where they were watching a music video for Creep by Radiohead, and it starts off really slow, and one of them, I think maybe Butthead is like, \"Uh, this sucks.\" And then the chorus comes, and it starts getting like all hyped, and they're like, they're like, \"Oh, this rocks. This rocks.\" And then I'm not going to do my Deep Butthead impression. So then it gets back to the slow part, and uh, they're like, \"Oh, wait. This sucks again.\" And then Butthead is like, \"Why don't they just play the cool part the entire time?\" And Beavis is like, \"Because if they didn't have the part of the song that sucked, the cool part wouldn't be as cool.\" And I was like, \"That is so profound.\" Like, that is, that is what life is all about is just like, if it didn't have the parts that sucked, the cool parts wouldn't be as cool. And we're always chasing the cool parts. We want it all to be the cool parts, but it can't. So, thank you, Beavis. Thank you, Beavis.\n\nOkay, final question. I love that you talked about fiction books because this is where my question was going to go. What's a fiction book that most impacted your product building approach or career or the way you think about product? Can I give a poem?\n\nAbsolutely. Even better, poem, extra credit. There's a poem by Derek Walcott, uh, about, it's called \"Sea Grapes,\" and it's about Odysseus, and he talks about, uh, Odysseus being driven by the ancient war between obsession and responsibility. And I read that line when I was like 18 years old, and it has always stuck with me. Um, and I, you know, I, I sort of mentioned earlier, I think about these like dualities that that drive us. And, um, I think as a, as a product person, I always feel like I'm like living between these two, like the obsession and the responsibility. Like, I just, I want to, like, I want to go so deep on this, and I want to, I want to spend like as much time as I possibly can just like sorting every little piece out. But like, we, we, we live in a society. Uh, we exist in a business. Uh, I am trying to create value for shareholders and trying to like bring these two things together. I feel like a has been like a, you know, the kind of defining struggle of my career. I think of many people's careers is like how you have something that you feel like you can really obsess over and have that flow over, um, or have that flow when you're working on, but then like, it's got to, it's got to kind of like work in this broader system as well. Uh, and I think that that's sort of been like the, the thing that I think of as the guiding post for like what I want to do with my career and with my life. Um, so I think it's got to be Derek Walcott. What a beautiful way to end it. Hillary, two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe follow up on stuff that you talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you? Great. Thank you. Um, so as I mentioned, I have a newsletter. It's hils.substack.com. That's hils.substack.com. Um, I'm also teaching a Maven class on being a super manager uh with AI. So, if you were listening to all this and you were like, \"Oh, Hillary, that sounds so great, but like I don't have time for any of that.\" How do you have time for all that? Like, honestly, hyperleveraging myself with AI has been a big part of how I find time to do any of this stuff. Um, and so I share a bunch about how I do that, how I use AI as a manager, um, building on a lot of the, the stuff that I shared on Claire's podcast as well on how I AI. Um, so you can find me on Maven there. We've got a couple cohorts coming up. And then, uh, yeah, I encourage everyone to to try out WHOOP. You can get a free month on me at join.woop.com/Hillary. That's Hillary with one L. And you can, you can post at me or tweet at me on X and let me know what you think of it. And I would love everyone's feedback because we're really excited about it.\n\nAs you were talking, I looked up your course just for make sure people can find it. So you go to maven.com, you just search for Hillary Gridley, and you'll find it. And it's, you can also, I realized that if you Google super manager, you will find me. So that is my new claim to fame. Oh my god, that's so great. Uh, 4.9 stars. Holy moly. There we go. Okay, Hillary, thank you so much. This was incredible. Covered everything I was hoping to. This was everything I wanted it to be. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. Thank you for having me. This was so fun. So fun. Bye everyone.\n\nThank you so much for listening.
