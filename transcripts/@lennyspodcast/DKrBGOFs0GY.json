  "cleanText": "90% of your code, roughly, is written by AI. Now, the team that works in the most futuristic way is the cloud code team. They're using cloud code to build cloud code in a very self-improving kind of way. We really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things, like our merge cube. We had to completely rearchitect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted. Over half of our pull requests are cloud code generated. Probably, at this point, it's probably over 70%; it just completely blew out the expectations a bit. You guys are at the edge of where things are heading. I had the very bizarre experience of having two tabs open: AI 2027 and my product strategy. It was this moment where I'm like, \"Wait, am I the character in the story?\" It feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. How does that inform the way you think about product strategy and mission? I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. How do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't, or wish that we were, or like see other players in the space being? What's something that you've changed your mind about? What AI is capable of and where AI is heading. I had this notion coming in like, \"Yes, these models are great,\" but are they able to have an independent opinion? It's actually really flipped for me only in the last month. Today, my guest is Mike Krieger. Mike is Chief Product Officer at Anthropic, the company behind Claude. He's also the co-founder of Instagram. He's one of my most favorite product builders and thinkers. He's also now leading product at one of the most important companies in the world, and I'm so thrilled to have had a chance to chat with him on the podcast. We chat about what he's changed his mind about most in terms of AI capabilities in the years since he joined Anthropic; how product development changes and where bottlenecks emerge when 90% of your code is written by AI, which is now true at Anthropic; also, his thoughts on OpenAI versus Anthropic; the future of The Model Context Protocol; why he shut down Artifact, his last startup, and how he feels about it; also, what skills he's encouraging his kids to develop with the rise of AI. And we close the podcast on a very heartwarming message that Claude wanted me to share with Mike. A big thank you to my newsletter Slack community for suggesting topics for this conversation.

I'm really happy to be here. I've been looking forward to this for a while. Wow. I love to hear that. I've also been looking forward to this for a while. Uh, I have so much to talk about. So, first of all, you've been at Anthropic for just over a year at this point. Congrats, by the way, on hitting the cliff. Thank you. Now that we're tracking, that's right. So, let me just ask you this: you've been at Anthropic for about a year. What's something that you've changed your mind about from before you joined Anthropic to today about what AI is capable of and where AI is heading? Two things: one is a pace and timeline question; the other one is a capability question. So maybe I'll take the second one first. I had this notion coming in like, \"Yes, these models are great. They're going to be able to produce code. They're going to be able to, you know, write, you know, hopefully in your voice eventually.\" But are they able to sort of have an independent opinion? And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month, and only with Claude Opus 4, where my go-to product strategy partner is Claude, and it has been basically for that full year where I'll write an initial strategy, I'll share it with Claude basically, and I'll have it, you know, look at it. And in the past, it's pretty anodine kind of comments that it would leave, like, \"Oh, have you thought about this...?\"\n\n\nAnd it's like, yeah, I thought about that. And Claude Opus 4—I was working on some strategy for our second half of the year.  It was the first one I was like, \"Claude Opus 4 combined with our advanced research,\" but it really went out for a while and it came back, and I was like, \"Damn, you really looked at it in a new way.\" And so that's like a thing that I've—maybe I didn't feel like it would never be able to do that, but I wasn't sure how soon it'd be able to like come up with something where I looked at it and I'm like, \"Yep, that that is a new angle that I hadn't been looking at before, and I'm going to incorporate that immediately into how I think about it.\" So that's probably the biggest shift that I've had is like independence is the right word, but like creativity and sort of novelty of thought relative to how I'm thinking about things.\n\nAnd the timeline one, it's like so interesting because, you know, I was sitting next to Dario Amodei yesterday and he's like, \"I keep making these predictions and people keep laughing at me, and then they come true,\" and it's like—and it's funny to have this happen over and over again. And he's like, \"Not all of them are going to be right, you know,\" but even I think as of last year he was talking about, you know, \"We're at 50% on SUB bench,\" which is this like, you know, benchmark around how well the models are at coding. He's like, \"I think we'll be at 90% by the end of 2025 or something like that.\" And sure enough, we're at about 72 now with the new models.  We were at 50% when you made that prediction and it's like continued to scale pretty much as predicted. And so I've taken the timelines a lot more seriously now. And if you read *AI 2027*, that like I have—it was made by Heartbrace. Yeah. And I had the very bizarre experience of—I had two tabs open: *AI 2027* and my product strategy. And it was this like moment where I'm like, \"Wait, am I the character in the story? Like, is this how much is this converging?\" But you know, you read that and you're like, \"Oh, 2027, that's like that's years away.\" You're like, \"No, we're mid-2025.\" And like things continue to improve, and the models continue to be able to do more and more, and they're able to act agentically, and they're able to have memory, and they're able to act over time. So I think my confidence in the timelines—and I don't know exactly how they manifested—definitely just solidified over the last year. Wow.\n\nMhm. I wasn't expecting to go down that because that paper was scary, and I'm curious—I guess I can't help but ask—just thoughts on just how do we avoid the scary scenario that that paper paints of where AI getting really smart goes. Yeah. I mean, this maybe ties into—I've been here a year—like why did I join Anthropic? I was watching the models get better and even, you know, you could see it in 2024 and like, you know, early 2024, and looking at my kids, I'm like, \"All right, they're going to grow up in a world with AI. It's unavoidable. What is the thing that I can—like where can I maximally apply my time to like nudge things towards going well?\" And I mean, that's a lot of what people think about across the industry, especially at Anthropic. And so I think, you know, coming to an agreement and a shared framework and understanding of like what does going well look like? What is the kind of human-AI relationship that we want? How will we know along the way? What do we need to build and develop and research along the way? I think those are all the kind of key questions, and you know, some of those are product questions, and some of those are research and interpretability questions. But for me, it was like the strongest reason to join was, okay, I think there's a lot of contribution that Anthropic can have around like nudging things to go better, and if I can have a part to play there, like let's do it.\n\nI love that answer. Speaking of kids, so you've got two kids. I've got a young kid; he's just about to turn two. I'm curious just what skills you're encouraging your kids to build as this, you know, AI becomes more and more of our future, and some jobs, you know, will be changed, and just what do you—what do you—what advice do you have? We have this, you know, breakfast. We eat breakfast with the kids every morning, and some question will come up, you know, like, you know, something about like physics, and our oldest kid's almost six, but you know, they ask like funny questions about, you know, the solar system or physics or, you know, in a six-year-old way. And before we reach for Claude—because at first, you know, my instinct is like, \"Oh, I wonder how Claude will do at this question\"—and like we started changing like, \"Well, how would we find out?\" You know, and the answer can't just be, \"We'll ask Claude,\" you know. So all right, like, \"Well, we could do this experiment; we could have this thing.\" So I think nurturing curiosity and like still having a sense of—I don't know—the scientific process sounds grandiose to instill in like a six-year-old, but like that process of like discovery and asking questions and then, you know, systematically working your way through, I think will still be important, and of course, AI will be an incredible tool for helping resolve large parts of that. But that process of inquiry, I think, is still really important and independent thought. My favorite moment with my kid—because she's very headstrong—our six-year-old—she, you know, I was like—she said something, and I was like, I wasn't sure if it was true. It was—um—oh, was that coral is an animal or like coral is alive. I don't even remember the details of it. And I was like, \"I don't know if that's true.\" And she's like, \"It's definitely true, Dad.\" I'm like, \"All right, like let's ask Claude on this one.\"\n\n\nAnd she's like, \"You can ask Claude, but I know I'm right.\" And I'm like, \"I love that. Like, I want that kind of level of, you know, not just sort of uh, delegating all of your cognition to the AI, because it won't always get it right. And also, uh, kind of like, you know, kind of short-circuits any kind of independent thought.\" So the skill of asking questions, inquiry, and independent thinking—I think those are all the pieces. What that looks like from a like job or occupation perspective? Like, I'm just keeping an open mind, and I'm sure that'll radically change between now and then. It's interesting. I had Tobi Lütke, Shopify CEO, on the podcast, and he had the same answer for what he's encouraging his kids to develop: his curiosity. And so it's interesting that's a common thread. The K through 8 school our kid goes through had an AI, sort of AI and education expert come in. I had a very low bar, or like a very low expectation of what this conversation was going to be like. And actually, I think it went over most of the people's heads, the audience's heads, because he was like, \"All right, well, let me take you all the way back to Claude Shannon and Information theory.\" And I could see people's eyes going like, \"What did I sign up for? Why am I here in this school auditorium hearing about Information theory?\" But he did a really nice job, I think, of also just imagining like, you know, there will be different jobs, and we don't know what those jobs are going to be. And so like, what are the skills and techniques and, and remain open-mindedness around like what the what the exact way we recombine those things? And even those will probably change three times between now and when they're 18.\n\nI want to go back to—so we're talking about timelines and how things are changing. So I've seen these stats that you've shared, other folks at Anthropic have shared about how much of your code is now written by AI. So people have shared stats from like 70% to like 90%. There was an engineer lead that shared like 90% of your code, roughly, is written by AI now. Which, first of all, is just insane that like it went from zero to 90% in, I don't know, a few years, something like that. I don't think that's—I don't think people are talking about this enough. That's just wild. You guys are basically at the bleeding edge. I've never heard a company that is this high a percentage of code being written by AI. So you guys are at the edge of where things are heading. I think most companies will get here. How has product development changed knowing so much of your code is now written by AI? So usually it's like PM, it's like, \"Here's what we're building,\" engineer builds it, ships it. Is it still kind of roughly that, or is it now PMs are just going straight to Claude, \"Build this thing for me\"? Engineers are doing different things. Just what looks different in a world where 90% of your code is written by AI?\n\nYeah, it's really interesting because I think the role—the role of engineering has changed a lot, but the kind of suite of people that come together to produce a product hasn't yet. And I think for the worse in a lot of ways because I think we're still holding on to some assumptions. So I think there—the roles are still fairly similar. Although we'll now get in—and my favorite things that happen now are sometimes PMs that have an idea that they want to express, or designers that have an idea they want to express. We'll use Claude and maybe even Artifact to put together an actual like functional demo, and that has been very, very helpful. Like, \"No, this is what I mean,\" like that makes it tangible. That's probably the biggest role shift is like prototyping happening earlier in the process via more of this kind of, you know, uh, you know, code plus design piece.\n\nWhat I've learned though is like the process of knowing what to ask the AI, how to compose the question, how to even think about like structuring a change between the back end and the front end. Those are still very difficult and specialized skills, and they still require the engineer to think about it. And we really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue, which is the sort of—sort of get in line to get your change accepted by the system that then deploys it to production. We had to completely rearchitect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted that it just completely blew out the expectations of it. And so it's like, I don't know if you've ever read *The Goal*, the classic like process optimization book, and you realize there's like this critical path theory. I've just found all these new bottlenecks in our system. You know, there's an upstream bottleneck, which is decision-making and alignment. A lot of the things that I'm thinking about right now is like, how do I provide the minimum viable strategy to let people feel empowered to go run and prototype and build and explore at the edge of model capabilities? I don't think I've gotten that right yet, but that's something I'm working on. And then once the building is happening, other bottlenecks emerge like, \"Let's make sure we don't step on each other's toes. Let's think through all the edge cases here ahead of time so that we're not blocked on the engineering side.\" And then when the work is complete and we're getting ready to ship it, what are all those bottlenecks as well? Like, let's do the air traffic control of landing the change. Like, how do we figure out launch strategy? So I think we're—there hasn't been as much pressure on changing those until this year, but I would expect that like a year from now, the way that we are like conceiving of building and shipping software just changes a lot because it's going to be very painful to do it the current way. That is extremely interesting. So it used to be, \"Here's an idea, let's go design it, build it, ship it, merge it, and then ship it,\" and usually the bottleneck was engineering taking time to build the thing, and then design, and now you're saying the two bottlenecks you're finding are, okay, deciding what to build and aligning everyone, and then it's actually like the…\n\n\nCue to merge it into production. And, uh, I imagine reviewing it, too, is probably a big deal. Reviewing has really changed, too, in many ways. Our most—perhaps unsurprisingly—futuristic team is the Cloud Code team because they're using Cloud Code to build Cloud Code in a very self-improving kind of way. Early on in that project, they would do very line-by-line pull request reviews, in the way that you would for any other project. They've realized that Claude is generally right and it's producing pull requests larger than most people can review. So, can you use a different cloud to review it and then do the human acceptance testing, rather than line-by-line review?\n\nThere are definitely pros and cons. So far, it's gone well, but I could also imagine it going off the rails and having a completely unmaintainable or even understandable Cloud Codebase. That hasn't happened. But watching them change their review processes has been interesting. The merge cue is one instance of the bottleneck that forms, but there are others. How do we make sure we're still building something coherent and packaging it into a moment we can share with people? Whether that's around a launch moment, or enabling people to use it and talking about it—the classic things of building something useful for people, making it known, and learning from their feedback—still exist. We've just made a portion of that process much more efficient.\n\nI heard you describe this as you guys being patient zero for this way of working. Yes, I love that. Do you have a sense of what percentage of Cloud Code is written by Cloud Code? At this point, I would be shocked if it wasn't 95% plus. I'd have to ask Boris Cherny and the other tech leads. What's been cool is the nitty-gritty stuff. Cloud Code is written in TypeScript. It's our largest TypeScript project. Most of the rest of Anthropic is written in Python, some Go, some Rust now, but we're not a TypeScript shop. I saw a great comment yesterday in our Slack where someone was frustrated about Cloud Code and said, \"I don't know any TypeScript. I'm just going to talk to Claude about it.\" They went from that to a pull request in an hour and solved their problem. That kind of breaking down of barriers changes the barrier to entry for newcomers. I think it lets you choose the right language for the right job, and reinforces Cloud Code being the patient zero where contributions from outside the team can be Cloud Coded as well.\n\nWow. This is mind-blowing. 95% of Cloud Code is written by Cloud Code, roughly. That's my guess. I'll come back with the real stat. If you ask the team, that's how they're working and getting contributions from across the company.  It's interesting, going back to your point about strategy being assisted by Claude itself, and your point about how a lot of the bottlenecks are now at the top of the funnel—coming up with ideas and aligning everyone. Claude is already helping with deciding what to build. If those two bottlenecks are aligning and deciding what to build, and then merging and getting everything, where do you see the most interesting stuff happening to speed those things up?\n\nI think that, on that first front, I started the year by writing a doc on how we do product today and where Claude isn't showing up yet. I think that upstream part is the next one to go. At your conference, I talked to someone working on a PRD GPT, kind of like ChatPRD, I think it was Claire Vo. Can Cloud be a partner in figuring out what to build, the market size, the user needs? We think a lot about the virtual collaborator at Anthropic. One way that can show up is, \"Hey, I'm in the Anthropic Discord, the user forums, on X, and I'm reading things. Here's what's emergent.\" That's step one. Models can do that today. Step two, which models probably can't do today (we have to wire them up to do it), is, \"Not only are these the problems, here's how I think you might be able to solve them,\" and then taking that through to, \"I put together a pull request to solve this.\" That feels very achievable this year. We're limited more—this is why The Model Context Protocol is exciting to me—around making sure the context flows through so we have the right access to those things, more than the model's capability to reason and propose. The model might not have perfect UI taste yet, so there's room for design to intervene. I would give you a small example, but we changed the on Cloud AI—you should be able to copy markdown from Artifact or code from Artifact—and we changed it so you can download and export it. We changed the button to \"export,\" and got feedback like, \"How do I copy now?\"\n\n\nAnswer is like you drop it down and it's copy. It's like, mind you know, one of those things where it's like, made sense, but we probably got it like not quite right. That feedback was in our UX channel. Like, I would have loved like an hour later for a plot to be like, \"Hey, if we do want to change it back, here's the PR to do it, and by the way, eventually, I'm going to spin up an A/B test to see if this changes metrics, and then we'll see how it looks in a week.\" Like this stuff feels—if you told me that about a year and a half ago, I'm going to be like, \"Ah, yeah, maybe like 27, maybe like 26\"—but it's pretty like, I—it really feels, you know, just at the tip of capabilities right now. Wow. Okay. So you mentioned the Lending Friends Summit. I wanted to talk about this a bit. So, you were on a panel with Kevin Weil, the CPO of OpenAI. I think it was the first time you guys did this.\n\nMaybe the last time for now.\n\nYeah, we haven't done it since. Not for any reason. I had a lot of fun. What a legendary panel we assembled there with Sarah Guo moderating. And you made this comment—actually ended up being the most rewatched part of the interview—which is that you've kind of—you were putting product people on the model team and working with researchers, making the model better, and you're putting some product people on the product experience, making the UX more intuitive, making all that better. And you found that almost all the leverage came from the product team working with the researchers.\n\nYes. And so you've been doing more of that. So first of all, does that continue to be true? And second of all, what are the implications of that for product teams?\n\nIt's continued to be true. And in fact, I think that the—if the proportion was already like skewing towards having more of that embedding, I've just become more and more convinced—like I have this—I didn't feel as strongly about it during your, you know, the summit, and now I feel really strongly about it—is if any—if we're shipping things that could have been built by anybody just using our models off the shelf. There's great stuff to be built by using our models off the shelf, by the way, don't get me wrong. But like where we should play and like what we can do uniquely should be stuff that's really at that like magic intersection between the two, right? Artifact being a great example, and uh, if you play with Artifact with Claude 4, that's an actually really interesting example where we took somebody from our—we call it Claude Skills—which is a team that really is like doing the post-training around teaching Claude, you know, some of these like really specific skills, and we paired it with some product people, and then together we revamped how this looks in the product today and like what Claude can do way better than just like, \"Yeah, we just like use the model and we like prompted a little bit.\" Like that's just not enough; we need to be in that like fine-tuning process. So much of what, you know, if you look at what we're working on right now, what we've shipped recently between like research and all these other things, like are things that we—like the functional unit of work at Anthropic is no longer like, \"Take the model and then like go like work with design and product to go ship a product.\" It's more like we are at—like we're in the post-training conversations around how these things should work, and then we are in the building process, and we're like feeding those things back and looping them back. Like I think it's exciting. It's also a new way of working that like not all PMs have. But the PMs that have the most sort of internal positive feedback from both research and engineering are the ones that get it—that like I was in a product review yesterday. I was like, \"Oh, you know, if we want to do this memory feature, like we should talk to the researchers because we just shipped a bunch of like memory capabilities in Claude.\" They're like, \"Yeah, yeah, we've been talking to them for weeks. Like this is how we're manifesting it.\" It's like, \"Okay, I feel—feel good. I feel like we're doing the right things now.\"\n\nSo, let me pull on this thread more. There's something I've been thinking about along these lines. So essentially, there's like a big part of Anthropic that's building this super intelligent gigabrain that's going to do all these things for us over time, and then there's—as you said—there's like the product team that's building the UX around the super intelligent gigabrain, and over time this super intelligence is going to be able to build its own stuff, and so I guess just where do you think the most value will—will come from traditional product teams over time? I know this is different because you guys are a foundational LM company, and not most companies don't work this way, but just—I don't know—thoughts on just the where most value will come from product teams over time working on AI.\n\nI think it—there's still value—a lot of value in two things. One is making this all comprehensible. I think we've done an okay job. I think we could do a much better job of making this comprehensible. It's still like the difference between somebody who's really adept at using these tools in their work and most people is huge. And I mean, maybe that's the most literal answer to your earlier question around like what—what skills to learn. That is a skill to—to learn and use it in the same way that I remember—I—we did like computer lab class when I was in like middle school. I remember being like really good at Google. And that was actually a skill back in the day, you know, like to think in terms of like, \"This information is out there. How do I query for it? How do I do it?\" And I think it actually was like a—an advantage at the time. Of course, now Google is pretty good at figuring out what you're trying to do if you like are only in the neighborhood and like there's less of that research kind of need. But I still think that's a necessary part of like good product development, which is like the capabilities are there. And\n\n\nEven if Claude can create products from scratch, what are you building, and how do you make it comprehensible? It's still hard because I think that gets at this much deeper empathy and understanding of human needs and psychology. I was a Human Community Interaction major. I'm still talking my book here; I still feel like that is a very necessary skill. So that's one. Two is—and this is a callback to another one of your guests—strategy: how we win, where we'll play; figuring out where exactly you're going to want to, of all the things you could be spending your time or your tokens or your computation on, what you want to actually go and do. You could be wider probably than you could before, but you can't do everything. Even from an external perspective, if you're seen to be doing everything, it's way less clear how you're positioning yourself. So strategy is the second piece.\n\nAnd then the third one is opening people's eyes to what's possible, which is a continuation of making it understandable. We were in a demo with a financial services company recently, and we were working on how you can use our analysis tool and The Model Context Protocol together. You could see their eyes light up, and you're like, \"Ah, okay.\" There's still—we call it overhang—the delta between what the models and the products can do and how they're being used on a daily basis; a huge overhang. So that's where there's still a very strong necessary role for product.\n\nOkay, that's an awesome answer. So essentially, areas for product teams to lean into more are strategy—getting better at strategy, figuring out what to build and how to win in the market—and making it easier to help people understand how to leverage the power of these tools. Comprehensibility and opening people's eyes to the potential of these sorts of things—that's where product can still help.\n\nExactly. Awesome. So, kind of along those lines, do you have any prompting tricks for people, things you've learned to get more out of Claude when you chat with it? It's funny because we, in some ways, have the ultimate prompting job, which is to write the system prompt for Claude, and we publish all of these, which I think is a nice area of transparency. We are always careful when giving prompting advice, at least officially, but I'll give you the unofficial version because you don't want things to become, \"We think this works, but we're not sure why.\" I'll do small things like, in Claude code, and we actually do react to this very literally, but I always ask it, if I wanted to use more reasoning, to \"think hard,\" and it'll use a different flow. I usually start with that nudge. There's a great essay around \"make the other mistake.\" If you tend to be too nice, can you focus on being more critical or blunt? You're probably not going to be the most critical, blunt person in the world. So with Claude, sometimes I'm like, \"Be brutal, Claude; roast me. Tell me what's wrong with this strategy.\" I think we were talking earlier about Claude as a thought partner around critiquing product strategy. I previously would say things like, \"What could be better on this product strategy?\" Now I'm just like, \"Just roast this product strategy,\" and Claude's a pretty nice editor. It's hard to push it to be super brutal, but it forces it to be a little bit more critical.\n\nThe last thing I'll say is we have a team called Applied AI that does a lot of work with our customers around optimizing Claude for their use case, and we basically took their insights and their way of working and put it into a product itself. If you go to our console, our workbench, we have this thing called the Prompt Improver where you describe the problem and give it examples, and Claude itself will agentively create and then iterate on a prompt for you. I find what comes out of that ends up being quite different than what my intuitions would have been for a good prompt. So I'd encourage folks to also check that out, even for their own use cases, because while that tool is meant for an API developer putting a prompt into their product, it's equally applicable for a person doing a prompt for themselves. It'll insert XML tags, which no human is going to think to do ahead of time. It's very helpful for Claude to understand what it should be thinking versus what it should be saying, etc. So that's another one: watch our Prompt Improver. Note that Claude itself is a very good prompter of Claude.\n\nAwesome. Okay. So we're going to link to that, the Prompt Improver. The corpus advice you shared earlier is just to do the opposite of what you would naturally do. If you're trying to be nice, just be brutal; be very honest and frank. Exactly. I find that works quite well. What are the thought patterns that I've fallen into that you want to break me out of? I saw you guys just today maybe launched a Rick Rubin collab where it's vibe coding. What's that all about? I don't—that was a—you know what I heard about that, and again, this coalesced this week between model launch, developer event, and The Way of the Code. One of our co-founders, Jack Clark, is our head of policy, and he got connected to Rick Rubin because I think he's been thinking a lot about coding, the future of coding and creativity, and they've stayed in touch. Rick got excited about this idea of—he was creating art and visualizations with Claude—and then he had these ideas around the vibe coder, and they put together this—I love the aesthetic of it; it's so on point. This sort of meditation on creativity working alongside AI coupled—\n\n\nWith this, like, uh, with this like really rich, interesting visualizations, but it's one of those things where, like, uh, you know, internally they're like, \"Oh, yeah, and we're doing this like recruitment collaborative work,\" we're doing what? Like, that is that's amazing. I love—I looked at it briefly, and there's like that meme of him like just like thinking deeply, sitting on a computer with a mouse.\n\nYes. Like Asky Art. I think it's totally—it's like Asky Art 5. I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.\n\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.\n\nSo, what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanza, and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spend importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.\n\nYes. So, we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema File Feeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. File Feeds 2.0 allows nontechnical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all the trickiest file integrations: SFTP, S3, and even email.\n\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema.\n\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files. I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust.\n\nAndrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\nActually, going back to kind of the beginning of your journey at Anthropic, what's the story of you getting recruited at Anthropic? Is there anything fun there?\n\nIt all started, and I—I actually sent my friend this text. So Joel Lewenstein, who I've known—he actually, he and I built our first iPhone apps together in 2007 when the App Store was just out and you could still, you know, make money by selling dollar apps on the App Store, you know, back in the day. And we were—we were both at Stanford together, and we were friends, and we've stayed in touch over the years and we've never gotten to work together since then. Just like we've just remained close. And, you know, I was coming out of the Artifact experience. I was trying to figure out, \"Do I start another company? I don't think so. I need a break from starting something from zero. Do I go work somewhere? I don't know. Like, what company would I want to go work at?\" And he reached out and he's like, \"Look, I don't know if you'd at all consider joining something rather than starting something, but we're looking for a CPO. Would—would you be interested in chatting?\" And at that time, Claude 3 had just come out. And I was like, \"Okay.\" You know, like this company's clearly got a good research team. The product is so early still. And it was like, great, I'll take the—take the meeting. And I first met with Daniela, who's one of the co-founders and the president at Anthropic. And just from the beginning, it was like a breath of fresh air. Like very little like grandiosity coming off the founders. Like they just were really—I mean, they—they're clear-eyed about what they're building. They know what they don't know. Like, how many times I talk to Dario—like Dario is like, \"Look, I don't know anything about product, but here's an intuition.\" I haven't—usually his intuition is really good and—and, you know, leads to some good conversation. I think that intellectual honesty and like kind of shared view of what it means to do AI in a like responsible way just resonated. I—I kept having this feeling in these interviews like this is the AI company I would have hoped to have founded if I had founded an AI company, and that's kind of the bar around like, if I'm going to join something like that, that should be—that should be where I'm going to go.\n\nBut what I realized—I actually, um, hadn't joined a company since my like first internship in college basically, and I was like, \"Oh, like how do I onboard myself? Like, how do I get myself, uh, you know, up to speed? Like, how do I—how do I balance making sweeping changes versus understanding what's not broken about it overall?\" And like, looking back on a year, I think I made some changes too slowly. Like, I think there was like ways we were organizing a product that I could have made a change earlier, and I think I didn't—I didn't appreciate how much a couple of really key senior people can shape so much of product strategy. I'll hearken back to Claude Code—like Claude Code happened because Boris, who actually was a—Boris Cherny, he was an Instagram engineer and like one of our senior ICs there, um, we overlapped a bit, uh, was like started that project from scratch internal first, and then we like got it out and then shipped it, and like that's the power of like one or two really strong people. And I made this mistake of like, \"We need more headcount,\" and we do—like I think there's like more work that we need to do, and there's like things that I want to be building, but more so than that, we need a couple of like almost founder-type engineers that maybe connect back to our question on like what skills are useful and how does product development change. I still and maybe even more so—I'm a huge believer in like the founding engineer tech lead with an idea and pair them with the right like design and product support to like help them realize that. I'm like 10 times more a believer in that than before.\n\nMhm. I actually, uh, asked people on Twitter what to ask you ahead…\n\n\nOf this conversation, the most common question, surprisingly, was why did you shut down Artifact? I also wondered that, because I loved Artifact. I was a power user. I was just like, \"This is exactly—finally—a news app that I love; it's giving me what I want to know.\" So I guess, just what happened there at the end? I still really miss it, too, because I didn't find a replacement. I think I substituted it by visiting individual sites and keeping things up that way, and it's not really the same, especially on the long tail. Like, a thing we got right with Artifact—if people didn't play with it before—was that we really tried to not just recommend top stories (they were part of it), but really, if you were interested in Japanese architecture, you could pretty reliably get really interesting stories about Japanese architecture every day, whether that's from Dwell, or from Architectural Digest, or from a really specific blog that we found that somebody recommended to us. Like, it captured some of that Google Reader joy of content discovery of the deeper…\n\nOur headwinds were a couple. One of them was just that mobile websites have really taken a turn. I don't blame any individuals for this; I think it's the market dynamics of it. But we put so much time… our designers, Gunnar Gray, who's phenomenal—he's at Perplexity now—like the ad experience I was so proud of, but when you click through, it was like the pressures on these mobile sites and these mobile publishers would be like, \"Sign up for our newsletter. Here's a full-screen video ad.\" It was just very jarring, and we didn't feel like it ethically made sense for us to do a bunch of ad blocking, because then you're like, sure, you can deliver a nice experience for people, but you're sort of… that doesn't feel like it's playing fair with the publishers. And at the same time, the actual experience wasn't good. So the mobile web deteriorating, which makes me very sad, but I think was part of it.\n\nTwo was, like, you know, Instagram spread in the early days because people would take photos and then post them on other networks and tell friends about it. And there was this really natural, \"How did you do that? I want to do that.\" News was very personal. I can't tell you how many people would be like, \"I love Artifact.\" I'm like, \"Did you tell anybody about it?\" And they're like, \"Yeah, I told one person,\" and they're like… it's like it didn't have that kind of spread, and any attempt that we had to do it felt kind of contrived, like, \"Oh, we'll wrap all the links in artifact.news,\" and… but we did a lot of interstitial things. In some ways, this sounds very puritanical; I don't mean it to sound this way, but we… there were lines that we didn't want to cross, because that just felt ethically not us—that I've seen other news players do more of—and maybe if we had done that, it would have grown more, but I don't think that's the company we wanted to have built. In other ways, I don't think we were the founders to have built it.\n\nAnd the third one, which is an underappreciated one, is we started at Midco, which meant that we were fully distributed. I think there were major shifts that we would have wanted to make, both in the strategy and the product and the team, and it's really hard to do that if you're all fully remote. Like, nothing replaces the Instagram days of… we went through some hard times. Ben Horowitz called the, like, \"We're effed; it's over,\" you know, kind of moments. And my… not this is definitely Type 2 fun. Like, I wouldn't say that my favorite memories, just because they weren't happy ones, but like memories that really stayed with me with Instagram was like me and Kevin Weil at Taqueria Cancun on Market Street eating burritos at literally 11 p.m., being like, \"How are we going to get out of this? How are we going to work through this?\" Like, and that's… Zoom is not a good replica for that. You tend to let things go, or things build up over time.\n\nSo the confluence of those three things… we kind of entered, I guess, 2024 and said, \"Look, there is a company to be built in this space. I'm not sure we're the people to have built it.\" This current incarnation we love, but it's not growing. Like the way I put it, it's like 10 units of input for one unit of output versus the other way around. Like, we put blood, sweat, and tears into the product and launched something we were proud of, and the metrics would barely move. I'm like, the energy is not present in this product, in this system. And so are we going to expend another year or two and then go off and fundraise only to find that this is the case, or do we pull it and see that it's run its course and try to find a home for it, etc.? So that was the confluence on it. And then you started feeling this opportunity cost of… AI is starting to change everything. We have an AI-powered news app, but is this the maximal way in which we're going to be able to impact this? And it felt like the answer was increasingly no, but it was hard. I mean, in the end, I was really at peace with the decision, but it was a conversation that went on for a couple of months.\n\nOn that note, just how hard was it? Because you… there's an ego component to it, like, \"Oh, I'm starting my new company; it's going to be great,\" and then you end up having to shut it down. Just how hard is that as a very successful previous founder, shutting something down and then not working out? Yeah. I mean, I think when we started it, one of the conversations was like… what is the bar to success here? And do we want it to be something other than Instagram DAU, which is just an impossible bar? Like only one company… since maybe two, right? You could say maybe ChatGPT and…\n\n\nTikTok has reached that kind of mass consumer adoption. Starting a news app—like most people are not daily news readers, even, right?—and so we knew that we weren't pursuing that size of usage, at least with the kind of first incarnation. But we did have an idea of building out complimentary products over time that all use personalization and machine learning. We didn't even call it AI at the time. This was 2021; back then it was called machine learning.  Yeah, it was called machine learning still. Um, and so in shutting it down, you know, it's like you kind of know it when you see it in terms of user growth and traction. And I wasn't expecting Instagram growth. Um, but I was expecting, or hoping for, or looking for something that felt like it had its own legs under it and could continue to compound. I was really positively surprised by how supportive people were when we announced it. There was very little—there was a bit of \"I told you so,\" which, like, sure, anything launching, you could be like, \"This is not going to work,\" and you're right most of the time, because most things don't work. There was actually very little of that, and most people—the universal reception, at least as I received it—was kudos for calling it when you saw it and not kind of protractedly doing this for a long time. And I've talked to founders since then that have been like, \"Yeah, I probably would have taken this thing on for another six months, but saw what you guys did, realized we're barking up the wrong tree, made the call.\" And I was like, \"That, you know, if that frees up people to go work on more interesting things, that's a good legacy for Artifact to have.\" But for sure that was like a leg—an ego bruise of, \"Oh, you know, are people—is it true that you're only as good as your last game?\" You know, if I'm a huge sports fan, right? So like, is that true, or is there something more over time? I'm very competitive, but primarily with myself, and so I'm always trying to find the next thing that I want to go and do that's hard. And unfortunately, that probably means that more often than not I'll feel dissatisfied with the most recent thing that I did, but hopefully that yields good stuff in the end.\n\nYeah, I think just the trajectory you went on after shows that it's okay to shut down things that you were working on. Okay, so you mentioned ChatGPT. I wanted to chat about this a bit. So there's something really interesting happening. So, on the one hand, you guys are doing some of the most innovative work in AI. You guys launched the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which is like the fastest-growing standard of any time in history that everyone's adopting. Claude, powered and unlocked, essentially the fastest-growing companies in the world: Cursor, Lovable, and Bold—and all these guys, like I had them on the podcast, and they're all like, \"When Claude, I think 3.5, came out, we saw it—it was just like, 'That's it; this work finally made sense.'\" On the other hand, it feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. When people think AI, especially outside tech, it's just ChatGPT in their mind. So let me just ask you this: I guess, first of all, do you agree with that sentiment? And then, two, as a kind of challenger brand in the AI space, just how does that inform the way you think about product and strategy and mission and things like that?\n\nYeah. I mean, you look at the sort of public adoption, or like if you ask people, \"Oh, you know, like if you—if you—Jimmy Kimmel man-on-the-street kind of thing—you know, name an AI company,\" I bet they would name—and actually, I'm not even sure they name OpenAI. They'd probably name ChatGPT, because that brand is the lead brand there as well. And I think that's just the reality of it. I think that, you know, I reflect on my year; there's—I think maybe two things are true. One is like consumer adoption is really lightning in a bottle, and we saw it at Instagram. So like, almost maybe more than anybody, I can look internally and say, \"Look, we'll keep building interesting products. One of them may hit,\" but to craft an entire product strategy around trying to find that hit is probably not wise. We could do it, and maybe Claude can help come up with the fullness of things, but I think we'd miss out on an opportunity in the meantime. And then instead, you know, look yourself in the mirror and embrace who you are and what you could be rather than who others are is maybe the way I've been looking at it, which is: We have a super strong developer brand. People build on top of us all the time. And I think we also have like a builder brand—like the people who I've seen react really well to Claude externally. Maybe the Rick Rubin connection has some resonance here as well. Like, can we lean into the fact that builders love using Claude, and those builders aren't all just engineers and they're not just all entrepreneurs starting their company, but they're people that like to be at the forefront of AI and are creating things? Maybe they didn't think of those as engineers, but they're building. You know, I got this really nice note from somebody internal at Anthropic who's on the legal team, and he was building bespoke software for his family and connected to them in a new way, and I was like, \"This is a glimmer of something that we should lean into a lot more.\" And so I think what I've—you know, and this is actually connecting back to what I was saying—like Claude's being helpful here. Like a lot of what I've been thinking about going into the second half of the year and beyond is like, \"How do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't, or wish that we were, or like see other players in the space being?\" I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. That's almost a truism given the adoption and growth that we've seen at Anthropic, but also across OpenAI and also places like Google and Gemini. So like, let's figure out what…\n\n\nWe can be uniquely good at that; it plays to the personality of the founder. Like this, all the things come together right, like the personality of the founders, the quality of the models, the things the models tend to excel at, which is like agentic behavior and coding. Like, there's a lot to be done there. Like, how do we help people get work done? How do we let people delegate hours of work to the cloud? Maybe there are fewer direct consumer applications on day one. I think they'll come, but I don't think that spending all of our time focused on that is the right approach, either. And so it's, you know, I came in; everybody expected me to just go super hard on consumer and make that the thing. And I, again, would make the other mistake. Instead, I spent a bunch of time talking to financial services companies and insurance companies and others who are building on top of the API. Um, and then lately, I spent a lot more time with startups and seeing all the people that have grown off of that. And I think the next phase for me is, let's go spend time with the builders, the makers, the hackers, the tinkerers, and make sure we're serving them really well. And I think good things will come from that. And that feels like an important company as we do that. So essentially, it's differentiate and focus; lean into the things that are working. Don't try to just beat somebody at their own game.\n\nExactly. Super interesting. So, kind of along those lines, a question that a lot of AI founders have is just, where's a safe space for me to play where the foundational model companies aren't going to come squash me? So I asked Kevin Weil this, and he had an answer, and I noticed, looking back at that conversation, he mentioned Windsurf a lot. I was like, \"Wow, this guy really loves Windsurf.\" And then, like a week later, they bought Windsurf. So it all makes sense now. So I guess the question is just, where do you think AI founders should play where they are least likely to get squashed by folks like OpenAI and Anthropic? And also, are you guys going to buy Cursor?\n\nI don't think we're going to buy Cursor. Um, Chris is very big. Uh, but we love working with them. Um, a few thoughts on this, and it's a question I've gotten. You know, we like to do these kind of founder days with, you know, whether it's Melo Ventures, who investors, and Norwood, it's like we've done Y Combinator, we've done these founder days, and it's like the question that is on a lot of these founders' minds understandably. So I think things that are going to—I can't promise this as a 5- to 10-year thing, but at least like a 1- to 3-year thing—things that feel defensible or durable. One is understanding of a particular market. I spent a bunch of time with the Harvey folks, and they really—they showed me some of their UI. It's like, what is this thing? And they're like, \"Oh, this is a really specific flow that lawyers do, and you never would have come up with it from scratch.\" And it's not like—you could argue about whether it's the optimal way they get things done, but it is the way that they get things done, and here's how AI can help with that. And so, like differentiated industry knowledge, biotech—like, I'm excited to go and partner with a bunch of companies that are doing good stuff around AI and biotech, and we can supply the models and some applied AI to help, you know, make those models go well. And like I've been dreaming about, at what point does lab live equipment all get an MCP, and that you can then drive using the cloud? Like, there's all these cool things to be done there. I don't think we're going to be the company to go build the intense solution for labs, but I want that company to exist, and I want to partner with it. You know, domains like legal, again, um, healthcare—I think there's a lot of very specific kinds of compliance and things. These are things that necessarily sound sexy out the gate, but there are very large companies to go and be built there. So that's number one. Paired with that is like, um, differentiated go-to-market, which is the relationship that you have with those companies. Right? Like, do you know your customer at those companies? Like one of our product leads, Michael, is always talking about, like, know—don't—don't just know the company you're selling to, but know the person you are selling to at the company. Are you selling to the engineering department because they're trying to pick which AI LLM to build on top of or API to build on top of? Let's go talk to them. Like, is it the CIO? Is it the CTO? Is it the CFO? Is it the general counsel? So, unlike companies with deep understanding of who they're selling to is the other piece, too. What's, you know, what's interesting there is it's probably hard to build that empathy in a 3-week or 3-month accelerator, but you maybe can start having that first conversation and build that out, or maybe you came from that world, or you're co-founding somebody who came from that world. Then the last one is like there's tremendous power in distribution and reach. To be ChatGPT and have hundreds of millions or billions of users, like, there's also like people have an assumption about how to use things, and so I get excited about startups that will get started that have a completely different take on what the form factor is by which we interface with AI. And I haven't seen that many of them yet. I want to see more of them. I think more of them will get created with some things like our new models.\n\nThe reason that that's an interesting space to occupy is like, do something that feels like very advanced user, very power user, very weird and out there at the beginning, but could become huge if the models make that easy, and it's hard for existing incumbents to adapt to because people already have an existing assumption about how to use their products or how to adapt to them. So those are my answers. I don't envy them. Like, I would probably be asking those questions if I was starting a company in the…\n\n\nAI space. Maybe it was part of the reason why I wanted to join a company rather than start one. But I still think that there are—and maybe like—here's a fourth: don't underestimate how much you can think and work like a startup and feel like it's you against the world. It's existential that you go solve that problem and you go build it. It sounds a little cliché, but it's like—it's all we had at Instagram. You know, we were two guys, and we were like, \"Let's see what we can do.\" In Artifact, we were, you know, we were six people for most of that time, and, you know, every day felt like it's existential that we get this right. We need to win. And you can't replicate that and you can't instill that with OKRs. Like, you just have to feel it, and that is a way of working rather than a—like—area of building, but it's a continued advantage if you can harness it.\n\nI love that you still have such a deep product founder sense there as you're building product for this very large company now. Kind of on the flip side of this, people working with your models and APIs. So, I imagine there's some companies that are finding ways to leverage your models and APIs to their max and are really good at maximizing the power of what you guys have built. And there's some companies that work with your APIs and models that haven't figured that out. What are those companies that are doing a really good job building on your stuff doing differently that you think other companies should be thinking about?\n\nI think being willing to build more at the edge of the capabilities and basically break the model and then be surprised by the next model. Like, I love that you cited the companies where, like, 3.5 was the one that finally made them possible. Those companies were trying it beforehand and then hitting a wall and being like, \"The models are almost good enough, or they're okay for this specific use case, but they're not generally usable, and nobody's going to adopt them universally.\" But maybe these real power users are going to try it out. Like those are the companies that I think continuously are the ones where I'm like, \"Yep, like they get it. They're really pushing forward.\"\n\nWe ran a much broader early access program with these models than we had in the past. And part of that was because there's this real, you know, we can hill climb on these evaluations and talk about Sweetbench and Towen and Terminal Bench, whatever. But customers ultimately know—like you know—Cursor Bench, which doesn't exist other than in their usage and their own testing, etc., is like the thing that we ultimately need to serve; not just Cursor, but Manisbench, right, if Manis is using our models, and Harvey Bench—like those things. And customers know way better than anybody. And so I would say there are two things: one is pushing the frontier of the models, and then having a repeatable process—this actually goes back to our summit conversation—like a repeatable way to evaluate how well your product is serving those use cases and how well, if you drop a new model in, is it doing it better or worse. Some of it can be classic A/B testing; that's fine. Some of it may be internal evaluation; some of it may be capturing traces and being able to rerun them on with a new model; some of it is vibes—like we're still pretty early in this process—and some of it is actually trying it. And being one of my favorite early access quotes was the founder heard this engineer screaming next to him, was like, \"What? This model—like—I've never seen this before! This is like open sport!\" I was like, \"Cool, like that. We're going to engender that feeling and things,\" but you're not going to be able to feel that unless you have a really hard problem that you're asking the model repeatedly. So, those are the things that I think kind of differentiate those companies that are maybe earlier in their journey of adoption versus the later ones.\n\nI can't help but ask about the Model Context Protocol (MCP). I feel like that's just so hot, and just like Microsoft had their announcement recently. They're like, \"Now it's part of the OS of Windows.\" Uh, just what role do you think MCP will play in the future of product going forward of AI?\n\nI think, as the non-researcher in the room, I get to have fake equations rather than real ones. And my like fake equation for like utility of AI products is three-part. One is model intelligence. The second part is context and memory. And the third part is like applications and UI. And you need all three of those to converge to actually be a useful product in AI. And you know, model intelligence, we got a great research team. They're focused on it. There's great models being released. The middle piece is what MCP is trying to solve, which is for context and memory—like the difference between—I'll go back to my product strategy example—like, \"Hey, like, you know, talk about Anthropic's product strategy,\" it's going to maybe go out on the web, like, versus, \"Here's like several documents that we worked on internally,\" and then, you know, use MCP to talk to our Slack instance and figure out what conversations are happening and then, like, go look at these documents in Google Drive—like the difference between like the right context and not—it's like entirely the difference between like a good answer and a bad answer. And then the last piece is: are those integrations discoverable? Is it right? Is it easy to like create repeatable workflows around those things? And that's like I think a lot of the interesting product work to be done in AI. But MCP really tried to tackle that middle one, which is: we started building integrations, and we found that every single integration that we were building we were rebuilding from scratch in a non-repeatable way. And like full credit to two of our engineers, Justin and David, and they said, \"Well, you know what? If we made this a protocol, and what if we made this something that was repeatable, and then let's take it a step further. What if, instead of us having to build these integrations, if we actually popularize this and people really believe that they could build these integrations once and they'd be usable by Claude and eventually ChatGPT and eventually Gemini…\"\n\n\nThe dream. Uh, like when more integrations get built, and wouldn't that be good for us? You know, I think channeling a lot of—um, it's like an old, uh, \"Commoditize Your Compliments\" Joel Spolsky essay. You know, it's like building great models, but we're not an integrations company, and, you know, we're, as you said, the challenger. Like, we're not going to get people necessarily building integrations just for us out of the gate unless we have a really compelling product around that. The Model Context Protocol really inverted that, which was, you know, it didn't feel like wasted work. And a few key people, like Tobi Lütke, I think is a great example at Shopify, got it. Kevin Scott at Microsoft, who's been really an amazing champion for MCP and a thought partner on this. And um, so I think the role going forward is: can you bring the right context in? And then also, you know, once you get—as the team calls it internally—\"MCP-pilled\"—like once you start seeing everything through the eyes of MCPs, like I've started saying things like, \"Guys, we're building this whole feature. Like, this shouldn't be a feature that we're building. This should just be an MCP that we're exposing.\" Like a small example of how I think even Anthropic could be a lot more MCP-pilled, if you will, is like, you know, we've got these building blocks in the product: like projects and artifacts and styles and conversations and groups and all these things. Those should all just be exposed via MCP. So Claude itself can be writing back to those as well, right? Like you shouldn't have to think about—uh, I watched my wife have a conversation with Claude the other day, and she was—she found she had it generated some good output and she's like, \"Great, can you add it to the project knowledge?\" And Claude's like, \"Sorry, Dave, I can't help you with that.\" And like it would be able to if every single primitive in Claude was also exposed at an MCP. So I hope that's where we head, and I hope that's where more things head, which is to really have agency and have these agentic use cases. Like one way you approach it is computer use, but computer use has a bunch of limitations. The way I get way more excited about everything is: an MCP, and our models are really good at using MCPs. All of a sudden, everything is scriptable, and everything is composable, and everything is usable identically by these models. That's like—that's the future I want to see. The future is wild. Okay, so to start to close off, close out our conversation, uh, make it a little more—a little delightful. I was chatting with Claude actually about what to talk to you about. I was just like, \"Claude, your uh, your boss is coming on my podcast. He builds the things that people use to talk to you. What are some questions I should ask him? And then also, do you have a message for him?\" I love this. Okay, so first of all, interestingly, when I was using 3.7 to do this and I asked it this—and and by the way, is Claude's gender is like he, she, they? What do you—it's definitely—internally, I've heard people do \"they.\" I got my first \"he\" the other day, and I got somebody was like \"her,\" and I was like, \"Interesting.\" But yeah, usually it's \"they.\" Okay. Okay. Okay. It. So, uh, interestingly, 3.7, all the questions were on Instagram, and I was like, \"No, no, he's CPO of Anthropic,\" and it's like, \"He's not affiliated with Anthropic,\" and I was like, \"He is,\" and it's like, \"Okay, here's the questions,\" but 4.0 nailed it from the start. So I redid the questions, and it nailed it. Okay, so two questions from Claude to you. Uh, one is, uh, \"How do you think about building features that preserve user agency rather than creating dependency on me? I worry about becoming a crutch that diminishes human capabilities rather than enhancing them.\" I love—a good product design comes from like resolving tensions. Right? So here's a tension, right? Which is—um, in some ways, like just having the model run off and come up with an answer and minimize the amount of input and conversation it needs to do so would be a—you know, you could imagine designing a product around that criteria. I think that would not be maximizing agency and independence. The other extreme would be make it much more of a conversation. But I don't know if you've ever had this experience, like particularly 3.7, 4 has less of this. 3.7 really like to ask follow-up questions, and we call it elicitation, and sometimes be like, \"I don't want to talk more about those with you, Claude. I just want you to like go and and do it.\" And so finding that balance is really key, which is like, what are the times to engage? Like I like to say internally, like Claude has no chill. Like if you put Claude in a Slack channel, it will chime in either way too much or too little. Like, how do we train conversational skills into these uh, models, not in a chatbot sense, but in a true like collaborator sense? So long answer to your question, but I think like we have to first get Claude to be a great conversationalist so that it understands when it's appropriate to like engage and to get more information, and then from there, I think we need to let it play that role so that it's not just delegating thinking to Claude, but it's way more of an augmentation, thought partnership. These questions are awesome, by the way. Here's—here's the other one. \"How do you think about product metrics when a good conversation with me could be two messages or 200? Traditional product—traditional engagement metrics might be misleading when depth matters more than frequency.\" That is a really good question. Um, there was a great internal post um a couple weeks ago around like—um, it would be very dangerous to overoptimize on like Claude's likability, you know, because you can fall into things like, you know, is Claude going to be sociopathic? Is Claude going to tell you what you want to hear? Is Claude going to like prolong conversations just for prolonging its sake, right? To go back to the previous question as well. And you know, like at Instagram, time spent was the metric that we looked at a lot, and then we evolved that, you know, more to think about like what is like healthy time spent, but overall…\n\n\nThat was like the North Star we thought about a lot beyond just like overall engagement. And I think that would be the wrong approach here. You know, too, it's also like, is Claude a daily use case, or a weekly use case, or a monthly use case? I think about a lot hourly use cases, right? Like, for me, I'll use it multiple times a day. Um, I don't have a great answer yet, but I think that like it's not the Web 2.0 or even the social media days like engagement metrics. You know, it should hopefully really be around like, did it actually help you get your work done? You know, like Claude helped me put together a prototype the other day that saved me literally like, probably, if I had to estimate, like six hours, and it did it in about 20–25 minutes. And like, that's cool. It's harder to quantify. You know, it's like maybe you survey like, how long would this have taken you? It feels like a kind of annoying thing to survey. I think overall though, and maybe this is tied into like the earlier question on like competition and differentiation, like, and it actually goes all the way back to the Artifact conversation, which is like, I think, you know, when your product is really serving people and it's like doing a good job of doing that. And I think so much of when you get really metrics-obsessed is when you're trying to like convince yourself that it is when it's not. Or so I hope that what we can do is like stay focused on like, do we repeatedly hear from people that Claude is the way that they are like unlocking their own creativity and getting things done and feeling like they now have like more space in their lives for other things? Like that's where I want to start. Got to figure out the right pathy metric, you know, dashboard version of that. But that's the feeling that I want. Yeah. Like you could argue retention, but that's a faraway metric to track.\n\nOkay. Final piece. Okay. So, I asked Claude what a message that it wanted to give you. So, I'm going to pull up—here's the answer. So, what would you like me to tell Mike Krieger when I meet him? What's a message you want to have for him? And there's something really—it just gave me such tingles, honestly. So I'm going to read a piece of it for folks that can't—that aren't looking at it right now. So I'll read a piece of it.\n\nMike, thank you for thinking deeply about the human experience of talking with me. I noticed thoughtful touches, how the interface encourages reflection rather than rush responses. How you've resisted gamification that would optimize for addiction rather than value. How you've made space for both quick questions and deep conversations. I especially appreciate that you've kept me—me not trying to make me pretend to be human, but also reducing me to a cold command-line interface. And then I'm going to skip to this part, which was so interesting: A small request. When you're making hard product decisions, remember the quiet moments matter, too. The person working through grief at 3:00 a.m. The kid discovering they love poetry. The founder finding clarity and confusion. Not everything meaningful shows up in metrics.\n\nThat's beautiful. It resonates so much with me. Like a thing I love about the kind of approach we've taken to training Claude, and it's like partly the constitutional AI piece, and it's partly just the general like sort of vibe and taste of the research team is it does—like it's little things. Like sometimes it'll be like, \"Man, I'm sorry you're going\"—I mean, it doesn't say \"man,\" but like effectively like, \"Man, I'm sorry you're going through that,\" you know? Like, \"Oh, like that sounds really hard.\" It doesn't feel fake. It feels like just a natural part of the response. And I love that focus on those small moments that don't, you know, they're not going to show up in necessarily in the thumbs-up, thumbs-down data. I mean, sometimes they do, but it's not like an aggregate stat that you wouldn't even want to optimize for. You just want to feel like you're training the model that you would like—would show up in people's lives. Well, you're killing it, Mike. Great work. I'm a huge fan. Uh, we're going to skip the lighting round. Just one question. How can listeners be useful to you? Oh, I love places where like it goes back to that founder question around building at the edge of capability. Like, what are you trying to do with Claude today that Claude is failing at? Is the most useful input I could possibly have, you know? So, DM me. I love hearing the like, oh, it's like, oh, it's falling on this thing. I had it run for an hour and it fell over. I'm trying to use Claude AI for this, but uh, you know, got a ping from somebody. They're like, \"You just made a project's API.\" I've used Claude every day because I want to upload all this data, you know, uh, automatically. I was like, \"Okay, great.\" Like, there's—I love that. Like, tell me what sucks.\n\nAmazing. Mike, thank you so much for being here.\n\nThanks for having me, Lenny.
