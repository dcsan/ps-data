  "cleanText": "In six months, he went from zero, basically nothing, to selling this company for 80 million plus dollars to Wix. The funny thing is that Base44, for the first time in my life, was not trying to build the biggest thing ever. Me and my girlfriend, we were on a plane. I told her, hey, you know what? If we get to 1.5 million till the end of 2025, we're going to buy a nice car. And we got there in like 4 weeks. I feel like the journey that you've been on over the last 6 months is kind of like the dream for a lot of founders. How long were you actually solo? The first person started a month and a half before the acquisition. So I think it's a different ball game because even if you're solo, you're literally managing teams of AI writing code. I don't think I've written a single line of HTML or JavaScript in the past 3 months. You're competing against very well-funded companies, Lovable, Bolt, Replit, Vercel. How did you get your first 10 users? I started with three users, really close friends. I got them to sit down with me every other day around the table and they would use the tool. They would try to build something. It would break. I'll take a look and then just build it for them. I'm not going to try and scale anything before I know that users enjoy it. And the best metric to see them enjoying it is that they're starting to share it with someone. Today my guest is Maor Shlomo. This is a unique episode because I almost never have conversations with early-stage founders. I made an exception because Maor's journey is in many ways the dream for a lot of founders. Maor started a company called Base44, which is essentially a more advanced vibe coding tool. 6 months later, just a few weeks ago, he sold the company for $80 million to Wix. He's a solo founder. It was just him for most of those 6 months. He never raised any money. He bootstrapped it and built it purely off profits. When he launched it on Product Hunt, it got so much love that the Product Hunt algorithm thought that it was bots when it was really just people from all over the world wanting to support the product. In our conversation, Maor shares exactly how he grew the product from zero to 10 to 100 to hundreds of thousands of users. His tech stack that allowed him to move so fast. The tools that he uses to be super productive as a solo founder with severe ADHD. Also, the super important insight that everyone needs to hear about how he came up with the idea and then refined the idea. Also just a bunch of common growth tactics that he tried that didn't work for him and some key advice for anyone looking to start their own bootstrapped company. A big thank you to Nam Seagal and Amir Klein for suggesting topics for this conversation.

The way teams turn feedback into product impact is stuck in the past. Vague reports, static taxonomies, unactionable insights that don't move business metrics. The result, churn, lost deals, missed growth. Sauce is the AI product co-pilot that helps CPOs and product teams uncover business impact and act faster. It listens to your sales calls, support tickets, churn reasons, and lost deals, surfacing the biggest product issues and opportunities in real time. It then routes them to the right teams to turn signals into PRDs, prototypes, and even code that drives revenue, retention, and adoption. That's why Whatnot, Linktree, Incident.io, and Zip use Sauce. One enterprise uncovered a product gap that unlocked $16 million ARR. Another caught a spiking issue and prevented millions in churn. You can too at s.app/lenny. Sauce, built for AI product teams. Don't get left behind. This episode is brought to you by Dscout. Design teams today are expected to move fast, but also to get it right. That's where Dscout comes in. Dscout is the all-in-one research platform built for modern product and design teams. Whether you're running usability tests, interviews, surveys, or in-the-wild fieldwork, Dscout makes it easy to connect with real users and get real insights fast. You can even test your Figma prototypes directly inside the platform. No juggling tools, no chasing ghost participants. And with the industry's most trusted panel plus AI-powered analysis, your team gets clarity and confidence to build better without slowing down. So if you're ready to streamline your research, speed up decisions, and design with impact, head to dscout.com to learn more. That's dsc.com. The answers you need to move confidently. Maor, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast. I am so excited to do that. Thank you for having me, Lenny. It's my pleasure. I don't actually do conversations like this often with early-stage founders, but I'm really excited to be doing this because I feel like the journey that you've been on over the last six months is kind of like the dream for a lot of founders, especially founders that don't want to build massive teams, that don't want to raise a ton of money. Basically, the journey you've been on is build a product. People loved it. It grew like crazy. You didn't raise any money. You sold it for $80 million. We'll talk about this 6 months in. And I know it's not all rainbows and butterflies and this amazing, you know, happy moment to moment all day, but I know it's a lot of hard work, but this is just what a lot of people want to achieve when they start a company. And you're just in the thick of it right now. Like you just announced your acquisition. So, I feel like this is a really unique point in time to extract as much wisdom out of your head as possible. Really the right time to kind of like reflect back and yeah, I think there's going to be many more times, but this is a really unique time. Let's start with a couple basics. Just what what is Base44 for folks that aren't super familiar with the product that you built? Base44 is an AI AI app building platform, meaning that you are able to use natural language to describe what you want to build an app, a game, a website or something like that, and then have AI code it for you. Um, we're not the first ones doing that. I think it's a very crowded category, but I think Base44 takes a very different approach, a very opinionated one for and one that that users or users like to call it a batteries included approach, which means that for every app that you build in Base44, you already have built-in included a database, integrations, user management, analytics, without connecting third-party services or bringing your API keys and so on. And I think it helps a lot when you're trying to scale a vibe coded application to be very complex and very functional. And so yeah, I think for most of the category nowadays, they're doing a fantastic job. One with building React web apps, like front-end web apps, and then when a user needs some backend stuff, they have a great integration with Superbase. Superbase, I think is the most common kind of thing that most competitors use. Um, and honestly, all of them are doing a great job with the integration, but as the nature of an integration, I think it's potentially slightly less strong than building everything full-stack built-in. And once we did that and actually I engineered the endpoints and the SDKs and whatever to work well with LLMs, I think Base44 does a really good job with building very complex and functional real-world applications. Okay. I want to talk about the origin story of just like how you even realized that there was an opportunity here. Clearly, it worked out. But before we get there, let me just share a couple stats about this journey to give people a sense of just how crazy this is. And add anything I'm missing. So, in six months, you went from zero, basically nothing, to selling this company for 80 million plus dollars to Wix. Uh, it took you three weeks to hit a million dollars ARR. You bootstrapped this business. I think you put in a few tens of thousands of shekels, not even US dollars. You have something like 400,000 users right now. You're a solo founder. Uh, there are two different wars involved in the journey. You're based in Israel, so you have to deal with that. And we're going to talk about some of the stories. Any other stats that are worth sharing? Anything else that's important high level before we get into the origin story? No, I don't think so. I think it like looking back, it sounds insane, but mostly this is it. Okay. I love that perspective. Okay. So, how did this start? There were two things I think that drove me to it. One, my girlfriend needed like a website to capture leads. She has like a small business. She's like an artist, and I tried building that with like one of the tools out there for website building, not an AI-powered one. And it was such a pain trying to do that, like designing with a drag and drop and everything, and then things get messed up in mobile, and you try again. And it's like, and then how do you manage your data and so on? And in my previous company, we dealt a lot with LLMs, and when while I was doing that, I was like, it doesn't make any sense. I know models can write the code to do exactly what I'm trying to do right now, like build a website for my girlfriend or build like slightly more complicated than a website was actually a web app. Um, I know models can do that. They just don't have the right infrastructure to do that. Like if I set up an infrastructure for like, hey, here the leads go to the database, like, okay, you can write React code, and it will serve it, and it will be great from an SEO perspective and so on, then I'll notice like it's going to be super easy, and she can do it on her own. And the other trigger, I was volunteering to help with the Scouts organization here in Israel with like everything that has to do with like system and software and back-office systems that they needed. And back then, like it's a huge organization, by the way, really huge, like tens of thousands of people, and they have many, as any other organization in the world that we're constantly living at, has many software needs. And so every time they needed to build something, they didn't have any internal devs, you know, any software engineers. So they'd reach out to other agencies, and agencies usually would quote them like a million bucks just to build something that I knew people could build. I was and still, by the way, a huge fan of tools like Retool for like the previous wave of like no-code tools, but then those tools were really more of like low-code tools, right? They still needed to know some JavaScript, something to make them work, to have the interruption, right? And again, also back then, I was like, I know for the software and systems that they want to build, I know it could be done. It just LLMs can write that, and we can really empower the organization to build all the different tools that they want, just give it the right setting, the right infrastructure so that the LLM has access to a database, maybe to another LLM to build like the app on top of AI, to have some user management, to have all those kind of things that it needs, but it can translate the user needs to actual code. Um, so those two were triggers back then. Um, I started a company 7 years ago called Explorium. Very different than Base44. Very much like enterprise top-down sales in the data space. Uh, very capital-heavy. We raised $130 million. I was a CEO for 7 years. Uh, then when the October 7th war broke out, I went to reserves for like almost a year. And then when I came out, I went to travel the world a bit just to take some time off and wanted to do what I was like what I like the most and I haven't had a chance because Explorium grew and grew and haven't had a chance for a while to do which is coding. Wanted to get back to building and get my hands dirty. And so I had those, given those experiences both with my partner, my girlfriend, and also with the Scouts, I was like, let's take a shot at it and start the product that I know is going to be very, very fun to build. And I think when you're approaching it this way and like not the usual way of like, let's raise a ton of money and try to own the category, and I knew I'm always getting into a very crowded category. I also knew that I have like some different angle and some different take on the category. Um, but when you're approaching it this way, it's like there's not a lot to lose, and I think it gives a lot of energy. Um, and that's how Base44 started. It definitely didn't think it's going to take off so fast. Um, but yep, that's pretty much about it. Okay. I like that you don't take good credit for the work you did to help it take off so fast. I'm excited to talk through that. Just first a few maybe takeaways from what you just shared of how this idea emerged for folks that are looking for ideas. Uh, one is clearly you were solving somebody's real problem, your own problem, helping your girlfriend build this website for her and then working with this Scouts program in Israel, basically building them software. So, so I think that's a really important takeaway. You weren't just like, hey, maybe this will be useful to someone. It's I have a real problem. I need I want to solve it and nothing out there is good enough, so I'm going to build it myself. Uh, the other is you said that you're having fun. Feels like that's an important element, just like you should enjoy it. You shouldn't feel like it's some kind of drag. You know what I feel like in like when I was a first-timer, when I first started my first company Explorium, I felt like many smart people told me those two very important truths: build something that you would want to use or that you'll actually use, and make sure that throughout time you keep doing something that you really like. And so when you're a first-timer, or at least for myself, when I heard those kind of things, I was like, yeah, those are cliches. Business is always important, let's increase revenue, let's close more deals. Um, and I feel like like those are even though it sounds like a cliche, it's so much easier one building something that you'll actually use, so I actually tried solving both problems, like I was building the product and at the same time\n\ndeveloping those two products for my girlfriend, for the Tzofim, and later on also for other friends and family. And we'll get to that. That's how I got like my first couple of users. But super important to build something that you use. You'll move forward so much faster. But also doing something that you love. I think I was the CEO of Exploring for 7 years. It was such a fantastic experience. It had so many highs and lows, but at some point it grew. And it took me too much time to realize that what I really like doing is just building products and scaling products and not necessarily like being a CEO, managing sales, managing HR, managing all those kind of things. And I think that that gives a lot of power. It's easier to work very hard when you're doing something you really like.\n\nLet's follow that thread and talk about being a solo founder. I think this is something a lot of founders like, you know, it's hard to find a co-founder. Out of the blue, when you have an idea, Y Combinator famously doesn't like solo founders. So I think there's a lot of power in what you've achieved. So let me just ask you first of all, any lessons about being a solo founder that you think would be helpful for other people considering starting a company on their own? And also, just how do you stay productive? How do you get stuff done as a solo founder using AI? One solo founder and specifically bootstrapping.\n\nIt's not for, I don't think it's suitable for every use case, right? If you're building like a B2B company, especially if you're like doing a B2B enterprise company, you'll need to hire a salesperson or sales team. You need to spend your money on marketing. It's going to be very hard to try to sell to a company when you're on your own and nobody knows if the product's going to stay there tomorrow. So I don't think it's like the right setting for every company. I feel like if you're building something that has the potential to be viral, to target the masses, and so it doesn't really matter if you're funded or not. You just build a great product that people will share. If you're able to do that and you're able to get out of like the escape velocity of getting to product-market fit, then everything is better doing a solo bootstrap than the other way around.\n\nOne else, like even from a pure cold angle of like the financial outcome, obviously if you're able to bootstrap your business and again get out of like the escape velocity and be profitable to some degree, then you'll likely generate a financial outcome that's, I think for most cases, way better than any other thing. Second is, so not specifically the solo, but the bootstrapping thing, less stressful. Like you wake up in the morning as if you're profitable and there's, I think there's this term default alive. It's so much easier. I've done both, and the weight of raising so much fund, even if your investors are great, and my investors were awesome and they were always supportive and so on, but even so, I feel like being bootstrap, no other money except yours in the business, and the business is growing and profitable, I feel like can keep the energies up. And I think I keep, one thing that I've learned from my previous company is like energies are super important. Usually it's a marathon. For me, it was a sprint. I thought it's going to be a marathon, but you want to do something that you like for years and years, and if you're able to show up every day, then your chances kind of go up immediately.\n\nBut then there's like a lot of downside and a lot of stressful moments doing that. One, just keeping the software up, keeping the servers up when you're solo, you don't have a DevOps team, you don't have on-call, you don't have anything. I think is really tough. I had a few accidents that really, I'm joking about that, but I'm saying it to my friends like, shortened my life a bit with just the stress. I had one funny, now I look at it as a funny moment where I was at my brother's wedding and we were doing the photo shoots, and I was actually the one who was supposed to also do the ceremony. And then during the photo shoots, I have a friend from MIT calls me up and he's like, \"Hey, somebody hacked into Base44, and it's like a crypto scam, and you've got to take care of that because people are building apps on top of Base44 and they're putting the data inside and so on.\" And I remember like hanging up the phone, I was like, \"Okay, I'll take a look at it immediately.\" I remember hanging up the phone and saying, \"I know, like it's such karma. I know for a fact it's true. Somebody probably hacked into that because what are the chances that on the only night that I'm not able to open up a laptop and handle that, this is what happens?\" And so I threw out there some excuse and like, I have to go and like practice towards the ceremony or something like that. Open up a laptop, spend two hours, two very scary hours of my life. It ended up being just the LLM tried using a package called cryptography, which is like a NodeJS, like a JavaScript package, has nothing to do with crypto. But obviously the user, not the technical user, saw this error of like, \"Hey, something cryptography or something like that,\" was sure that someone like a crypto scam hacked into their app. And so you have a lot of those like moments that the whole thing is like you're not able to share it with anyone, share the burden, even the stress, or put anyone on top of it and say, \"Hey, you know what? I'm out for today. Like, you handle that.\" In my previous company, my two co-founders, we were really good friends, like great friends, and even if one of us would mess up, then still would have someone to share it with and run jokes around and just be there with someone. So, when you're solo, it's hard.\n\nAnd then brutal prioritization, which is something you have to do because you have to keep up the pace of the product. And obviously nowadays with AI and like everyone can build software, like you have to go extremely fast on one side, and on the other side, figure out marketing along the way and how to do that. And every time I remember that every time I had this ceremony where I'd start the day and try to look inside and ask myself, what do I need to work on today? And what do I want to work on today? So what I woke on today was always like, I want to code. That's what I like to do. Let's improve the product. I know there's like a bug that annoys some of the users. I know there's like the feature that's in my head that I'm saying, \"Oh, competition haven't thought about that. I have to build it. I have to put it out there to be in front of everything.\" And then it's like, what do I have to do today? And so at many different stages on Base44's journey, it was, I know I can improve the product a lot, but I need to do some more marketing. Or I need to, I know this is not the bottleneck. I know people are converting well, they're growing, retention is looking good. And it's all about just increasing the audience, even though I know I need, even though I want, I really want to work on the product. And so I think there's like this context switching is hard.\n\nAnd the last piece obviously is I was spending a lot of my time on making sure that my setup, like how I code, how I write content and so on is optimized and everything is automated. So I spent a lot of time thinking and agonizing about how to structure the code repository, for example, so that I can use Cursor for backend and Base44 for frontend to write code really fast. And this was really important for me to keep trying to find out new ways of how to automate and increase the pace of building solo because if you're able to correct that, I feel like smaller teams with a lot of context nowadays can move faster. And the same goes also for marketing and for other tools where you want to automate as much as you can, especially when you're solo, because time is going to be the thing that kills your business if you're not managing it right.\n\nOkay, let me follow that thread. That's a really interesting topic. So what is in your stack of productivity for yourself? And then just that allowed you to build Base44? Just like the tech stack of Base44. So you said Cursor, Base44. What else did you use day-to-day that helped you be more efficient?\n\nSo I have severe ADHD, and so it can also be a superpower, but then you have to first make sure that your workday looks like that, that you can be focused and that you get a lot of deep work. And so I use a product called RescueTime, which I really like, but I think there's a bunch of other products. It shuts down every access to Twitter and LinkedIn and so on. This was really hard because I was starting to do this building in public, which turned out to work pretty well for Base44. And so every time you want to take a look at your post or see how many likes and impressions and so on, but then you can't work on anything else. And so I had this first setup that really allowed me a certain set of software tools that I can use to manage deep work. Cursor has been awesome. Base44, not only did the work for the frontend side, but also a lot of the business apps that I used on top of Base44. So where I'd manage users and give credits and write content, and then I had this app where I'd at the start of the week write some high-level content ideas, and then the Base44 app will take it and break it down to something that sounds more like me for a LinkedIn post, and then I'd approve that, and then it would break it down to a Twitter post. And so I wrote things that were really customized to my process and what I wanted to do, which really helped. But I think you can do that not only with Base44, you can code your way into productivity tools that really fit what you want to do and what process for you looks like. And I had, for example, for my social posts and so on, there's a process that I would follow, and maybe no one else would follow that. And so coding a custom app for that was really helpful.\n\nLet me actually ask about that. That is super cool. So you built basically internal tools for yourself using Base44. People can use other tools potentially. So you built one that's like, help me craft a tweet. How does that actually look like? What is the input? That sounds really interesting.\n\nSo the way that I like to work is like I would have those moments where I would have inspiration for a piece of content, right? So the way I grew Base44, probably a different topic, but was a lot around building in public and growing an audience and speaking to my audience, who were fellow builders. So it was really easy. So a lot of that was around sharing on the Base44 journey. And then I'll have a process that I follow is like I'll write down before that on a piece of paper some ideas that I had for posts for throughout the week because you want to keep consistency and keep putting great things out there. And then my process before the app was like I'd go to ChatGPT, I'll write like a very vague kind of structure or skeleton of a post and tell it like, \"Hey, fix my writing, improve my writing a bit.\" And then ChatGPT will spit out something that was like too far off, too much like too salesy, not my tone. And then I'll say, \"No, keep closer to the original.\" And we'll fight about that. And then like remove the emojis, the hyphens look weird and so on. So, okay, I'll have now my LinkedIn post and I need to generate an image for that. So I'll go to a different tool. And then I'll take this LinkedIn post and now, okay, I need to put it out also on my Twitter account. So, okay, let's break it down to a Twitter thread. Now you need to shorten it. It's you need to make some adjustments to the content. And so I've taken this entire process, which I think was working for me, and just coded an app around it to help me speed it up. And then made sure that the LLM inside the app was using my own tone of voice and was saving the previous posts to understand how it looks like, what are the posts that I really like that I've written beforehand, so that in the next post it will speak just like me.\n\nThis might be a good plug for Base44. So, like say someone were to go to Base44.com and try this out. What would be a prompt you'd suggest? Like how they get started building a tool like this?\n\nUsually what I'll do is I'll write down. I think LLMs nowadays do a very good job with like, start vague. It's going to build the skeleton for what you need. And Base44 does a good job with this, understanding at least the big pieces. Okay, there's going to be an LLM writing the content. There's going to be this and that. And so you don't have to write the entire spec. It's just like something like, \"Hey, I want to build my own content generation AI-powered tool. Here's my process currently.\" And my process is doing this, and then LinkedIn, and then Twitter, write something to support that. And then from there, iterate. And also something that I really like with the entire category, again, not only Base44, I feel like there's tons of tools doing a great job. But something I really like in Base44 is that you can, because it's really easy to change the software, it's like you get this adaptive software. As you improve your processes or maybe your processes change, you adapt it. So like Base44 got acquired by Wix two weeks ago. And so now the process of putting content out there looks a bit different. And so with just two prompts, you change it to support your new process, which is really fun.\n\nThat's a cool phrase, adaptive software. I heard malleable software is another way to describe this. Let me, I want to talk about growth, but a couple more things real quick. This idea of bootstrapping. I'm curious. So essentially, you're competing against very well-funded companies. Lovable, Bolt, Replit, Vzero, Vercel, Cursor raised, I don't know, a bazillion dollars.\n\nThis point. I know you're not competing with Cursor directly. If you weren't going to be acquired by Wix, did you think did you plan on raising money? Do you think you had a chance staying bootstrapped competing against the folks that everyone's, you know, the more popular products today? Base44 was like fairly profitable, much more than than what I thought. So even if like even if I wasn't getting acquired, I thought like I can make good money out of it. It ended up like I remember we I I had like a very failed Product Hunt launch at like mid-January and then started writing some uh like started building in public at around start of February and that's where it took off and then started like I think first dollar or like the the first $10 or $100 bucks were towards um March and then in May I already did close to $200k in profit. Um, and so I think uh I think either way there was like a room to compete and even though it was small I was seeing that the the users that come to me stick like that come to B44 stick with B44 even though they're very familiar with like the rest of the competition. The challenge was obviously making as much noise as the other folks. Uh so you can see like the other vibe coding tools doing like a million dollars hackathons and so on and doing an awesome job on a growth really. Uh but I didn't have the resources so I tried finding ways to fight the fight. Uh, I think we had a very successful hackathon for good, which turned out to be a great growth engine and also did good in the world, which is like we had 3,000 teams just building some great uh do good uh apps. But also, to be very honest, I think part of the reason to get acquired is because this market has been moving so fast, faster than anything I've seen, faster than what I I thought it's going to move. And at some point, I figure it's going to be like you see Base44 grows and you start thinking, hey, this can really help people with their lives. Like this, this is like one of those software categories that I'm saying that I'm very not objective, but I feel like can really move the needle for a lot of people. I've been seeing people build like fantastic awesome things. And so I was like, let's go for the like the big one. Let's try and actually build some global scale, maybe lead the category, maybe win it. I felt like the best chances to do that is to uh partner up with Wix. There's like plenty of reasons to do that. We can we can touch on that later, but like same DNA, same customer base, like they know what they're doing. They're seeing and and obviously like very good connection with with the entire management team over there. And so I feel like the acquisition, again being very honest, I felt like it's going to be a financial success either way, but the acquisition is like taking a stance and saying, you know what, let's let's let's play in the big league and and and let's uh punch down, not only punch up uh when when fighting in this very crowded space. Uh and that's part of the reason why to get acquired.\n\nThat was really insightful. So part of the part of what I'm hearing is you could have stayed independent and made a really good income and built a really good business at least for a while. Who knows what would have happened long term. Uh but it as a solopreneur as someone that's never raised money, you can make significant income doing something like this in a crowded space if you have something that people love that didn't have people up. So I think that's a really interesting insight. Like it's okay if there's a bazillion dollars in funding going to competitors. There's a lot of there's a big market here.\n\nYeah, I think it's a bit different ball game right now. I was like I was scared many times like I I thought how how am I gonna go go into the fight? Those companies are one some of the fastest growing companies ever. Again, they're like great teams and very well funded and a lot of money being poured into. Um but then like throughout time I saw that I'm able to keep the pace if not even have the like a faster pace and have like a different angle and and it's not changing over time. So like nobody's like and so I think it's a different ball game because even like if you're very a very small team or even if you're solo like you're you're literally managing like teams of AI is like writing code. I don't think I've written a single line of like HTML or JavaScript in the past 3 months but still like that Base44 front end changes a lot because uh AI writes that. So yeah, if you if you have an interesting angle and you're able to move fast, I feel like money and funding is not necessarily the the factor to win a category. And that's going to be like and and that's going to change even more drastically in future as LLMs get better. It's like people like 10x engineers would have way more impact. There going to be 100x engineers because they're able to manage LLMs and it's not necessarily the team size nor the funding uh that that will be able to win you a category and what you just shared is amazing that you've haven't written any you said JavaScript or HTML in three months which is half the lifetime of this company which sold for $80 million and more potentially. It feels like now the big things you got to get right is kind of like at the beginning of figuring out what problems to solve and being really good at understanding where the gaps are and then it's distribution marketing getting people to be aware that you exist and give you a shot.\n\nYeah. And even distribution, I'm still learning the art that is like it's a even distribution nowadays, it's very different. And and also in favor of like the solo, not necessarily the solo, but like not necessarily that you're going to pour a lot of money on paid campaigns. Like B44 with close to zero marketing budget. I spent like a uh $2,000 on an influencer post that didn't really bring anything and then tried paid for like a couple of thousands of bucks. Um didn't really work and so everything was like organically and built in public and so even distribution is is very different but yeah if you have an interesting take on any domain Base44's first user was one of my best friends like we grew up together and up to few months ago he was a restaurant manager um and then he left and started like a SAS company for managing invoices for restaurants so this is a guy that has both distribution. Obviously, this is very local like software and company uh but has distributions like has those connections but has a very deep domain knowledge and now that like the technical he has no like he him and coding are like very different in their very different places. Um and so I think if like domain knowledge become or or domain expertise and some again interesting take on a domain or or a product or a category becomes like a key thing and then distribution. Yeah, that's a hard one to get. Uh but also a world that's changing a lot.\n\nYeah. And I I love that you did it with no funding. The other thought here as you're talking is it feels like you could have kept doing this and made money and lived a great life, but there's this question of how ambitious do you want to be? I've gone through this myself where I was like, \"Oh, this newsletter is I'm making a living off this writing one email a week.\" Uh, I could do live really well just doing this, but then I'm like, \"Oh, why not do a podcast? Why not do another podcast? Why not do some other stuff?\" And the reason I do that is I just like it's boring to do something the same way forever. And there's this opportunity that's out there. I'm like, I should do that. Uh, and I feel like some people are on it. I just don't need that. I'm good. I'm going to live in, I don't know, Fiji and just code it and make $100, $300, $500k a year from this thing. But I feel like folks like you, like there's more ambition and one way is raise a bunch of money, another sell to a company that has a platform that you can build on.\n\nYeah, I empathize with this a lot, but the funny thing is that like B44 for the first time in my life was not trying to build the biggest thing ever. So I remember like when I started exploring my previous company, I was so um like so hung up on like let's raise the most amount of money in the least amount of time. I remember that I showed like remember that I looked kept looking like, hey Exploium raised $100 million before Snowflake. This is insane. This is amazing and so on. Um and I did that for seven years. Um and I think B4 is the first time that like I stopped and said, you know what, I just want to go back to do what I really love, which is just building a product. I don't care if it like if it wins the category or not. I don't care if it's going to become really big or not. Um, I remember when we when when me and my girlfriend got back from like the trip to Asia and we were on the plane, I told her, \"Hey, you know what? If if we get to $1.5 million, I don't remember where I said exactly this number, like if we get to $1.5 million in ARR till the end of 2025, uh we're going to buy a nice car.\" Uh and we got there in like four weeks. And so it was the first time like saying, let's not try and build the biggest thing. Let's just do something I really like. Um and let's just build a product that I'm going to enjoy building. But then at some point it got to be very very successful. I think it comes with like once you seeing success and you see like true positive impact on people then you're saying okay you know what, let's go for the like let's play in the big league um and try to scale it that uh so aligns with my journey. I similarly I'm like I'm just going to do a newsletter. Life's going to be great. I'm not going to build I'm not I I called it my anti-empire. I don't want to build anything big. I'm just going to keep it chill project chill project avoid getting a real job. That's what I called it. And and I think that is a really big insight. Some of the best stuff comes from not putting a bunch of pressure on yourself, trying to build something huge uh and just following a poll, following your interests, following uh just that insight you have and ends up being some of the best ideas come out of that and the biggest ideas.\n\nI love it. I agree with that. Yeah.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Contentsquare, the analytics platform that helps companies build better digital experiences.

So, here's what I want to do. I want to talk through just how you got the first users of B44. So, I'm thinking maybe how'd you get like the first 10 users? How'd you get the first hundred users? How'd you get the first thousand users? What are the the levers used there? What are the tactics? So, let's start with 10. How'd you get your first 10 users?\n\nJust begging people close to me that I feel like that they have uh that I have really good connections with uh to use it. I feel like there's no other way. And maybe there are other ways but um again I was very new to like uh B2C like to consumerish type of product and so I grabbed well I started with even three users like really close friends. Two of them back at the time I caught them in like a part of their life where they were unemployed. So I was like hey why don't you try build a SAS business or something like that. And so three really close friends um where somehow I got them to sit down with me every other day around the table and they would use the the tool. They will try to build something. It will break. I'll take a look. I'll take a look at the logs. I'll go back to my computer, try to change it, push into production and then just build it for them. I feel like plenty of people are lucky to find maybe a method that consistently works for your like 10, 100, a thousand uh users and then from there. But I try to look at it as like milestones. And so first I was like I'm not going to try and scale anything before I know that uh users enjoy it and and the best metric to to seeing them enjoying it or or at least making value out of it even if they're not enjoying because there plenty of bugs and slowness and so on is that they're starting to share it with with someone. So I haven't invested anything in marketing before. I felt like okay for the first three or five or 10 friends at some point they started sharing it with their friends like you'd see okay there's like one new user today and then two new users today and so on. So once it started happening even on very low percentages because uh B44 turned out later in its journey to be very viral but back then it was like an okay product. People loved it and and all liked it and started sharing it with it. And so once I started seeing that this works uh and we got to like 10 users where all my friends and then and then the 11th user or something like that started seeing people that don't really know me. That's why I knew okay now it's time to invest in marketing or try to launch this thing or try to like get more people to use it because if you try to do it beforehand I feel like you're going to waste a lot of time and resources on just like having a very revolving door like you get users in and users out. you will not be able to to and unless you have like a lot of money to invest in paid so that like it makes sense then then it's very hard. I knew that I'm not going to do that. It's like a product that I'm building. I wanted to be profitable from the get-go and not feeling bad for investing too much money into your page and so on. And so I knew that it has to be viral. At some point I started starting to look like it's viral. Then I did\n\nA very failed, very bad uh Product Hunt launch. Uh, but also now looking back and saying this is completely fine. I feel like people sometimes treat their launches like product launches as like make it or break it for the company. This wasn't the case for me. I was like, this is a tool for me to get to my next 30 users, my next 50 users. And that's exactly what happened. And so, first Product Hunt launch, we got like 50. I got like 15 new users. By the way, the second one broke Product Hunt. They thought there were like plenty of bots. We won the first product of the day and the first product of the week, but it's a different story. Um, and so we got like 50 users and we got the first user to pay. This was an insane, an insane feeling because I'm like an entrepreneur coming from like the enterprise space. I was thinking that this is insane. Why would anyone pay for my product without meeting me, without like looking me dead in the eyes or trying to get a discount and so on? Obviously, this user turned in like a few hours. The product wasn't good back then. Um, but from there, I started seeing some very slow growth. So, I got my first 50 and then 20 left and then the other 30 started sharing it with like other users that were really good. And then I tried a bunch of marketing things. Didn't work. Uh, influencer post or paid or something like that. And then one of my friends, uh, was also a founder in a different, different space, told me, hey, you know what? I think it's really cool that you're building it on your own and that you're like, you're trying to like take a very different approach than the usual VC funded way. Why don't you share like content about that? Like, at the end of the day, it's like you're going to have this, the same like your audience are builders. They're trying to build their own products or or maybe even businesses, and it will likely resonate with them. And so I started sharing the journey on, uh, LinkedIn. And I remember like seeing posts like, okay, there's this nice concept of building public and people get really interested. And I think here in Base44, I had like this really nice, uh, synergy between the building public and also my audience was like builders, right? If I was like building, I don't know, a product for attorneys, then probably this would wouldn't have made a lot of sense. Once I started like sharing, uh, what I'm building in public and getting more users and improving the product tremendously, I was so lucky. Like the, the community around B44 is is nothing like I've ever seen. It's like so supportive. There's so much feedback. And so from the, the loop of like improving the product, this is exactly like how how people say it should feel like is like people asking for features before you can actually build them. They're getting so excited about your product. The writing the nicest things. People have tried like started writing like, hey, you changed my life. I wanted to build. I had that like those ideas throughout my life. I didn't have a like an ability to do that or resources or money to pay for developers. And then the other thing that I did, it worked really well, is I've noticed that people really like sharing what they're building, uh, on top of Base44. Like they would write posts. I remember at some point a friend of mine reached out and he was like, uh, dude, how much are you paying those people to, to like write posts about Base44? I was like, I'm not paying anyone, honestly. And so what I did is I actually, I did this program inside B44, saying, hey, if you share just about the process of building the app or the app itself, it doesn't even have to be about B44. If you share it in social, you'll get extra credits to build. And so those two, um, like building public and giving up credits worked extremely well. Um, and that's how we got golf going.\n\nOkay, let's pause there. That was awesome. Uh, how many users do you have at this point of the journey, roughly?\n\nI think there was like two weeks between, no, a week between having like being on a pace of like 20 users a day to seeing, uh, 4,000 users come into your product, like new users a day.\n\nUm, break the product. Like it was hard scaling it. Also, there's like some things I needed to learn, uh, while moving. It's like, okay, I wasn't a DevOps engineer. I don't know how to scale databases. I didn't know that a virtual CPU would really come back at me when when trying to scale and so on. Um, and again, trying to be profitable and so you you try to use every free tier that you can, but then once you start scaling, it's really bad. So yeah, I think once I started sharing, uh, in public, it grew to a few thousands.\n\nOkay.\n\nA day and then for the credit thing, like did the rest.\n\nOkay, so this is kind of like the whole journey. I know there's a few other elements I want to touch on, but let me point out a few things that stood out to me that I think might be helpful to folks. The first is right at the beginning, that coming back to a lesson you shared at the beginning, which is build for specific people. So, initially it was built for yourself, built for your girlfriend, built for the scouts program, and then it was built for these like three friends just building it, sitting with them, uh, building the things they need to use it, which is really interesting because a lot of times the advice you get is look for, look for pull, look for people with problems to solve. Uh, like you almost went the opposite. Like you're like, use my product. I need you as a favor. Use my product and help me make it better.\n\nAbsolutely. Also, like I don't know, there, I think maybe paradigms are changing, but there are some things that I don't believe in, is like MVPs first and foremost, is like if you're building something that people will not be able to use or is not good enough, especially these days where it's so much easier to build software. So the attention span for people to actually try out new software products is is is getting shorter and shorter. Yeah, pick a bunch of people that, I don't know, owe you something or or have any reason to use your product when when it's bad. Build for them. Be there physically. I remember that even when we passed, uh, 20k users, 50k users, and 100k users, it was still very tough to get the right feedback. So I would bring like 20, 30 people to like a room together, like almost like a focus group or a small hackathon. I'll do that every other week, um, just to get feedback, and it was so much easier than any other thing. And it was the same thing that I tried developing when we were just like three users and five users. And so yeah, build it for them. They can come from different backgrounds. Again, something else that I don't really empathize with or or agree with is like you have to have like a certain ICP. It's not, it's not necessarily about like the profile of a person, more of like what they're trying to do is like way more important. So you can have different types of people, but they're all trying to do the same thing, right? They're trying to build a tool.\n\nI think some of this people should remember the tool you're building is a specific kind of tool that helps you build things. And so these lessons don't necessarily apply. Uh, in a lot of cases, you want to be really specific with ICP because there's like one thing you accomplish with this thing versus this very horizontal product.\n\nI agree. But I think that's still very good to know because maybe for your product, you hear all this advice, you need a very narrow focus. You got to have a very specific role and company size and all these things. You're like, \"Okay, maybe not. Maybe if your tool is something that a lot of people can use for a lot of different reasons, don't worry about that too much.\" Okay, so step one, shared it with friends, a few friends, like forced them to use it. Please use this. I'm going to watch you. Your point about being there physically, I think, is really interesting. Like don't just send it to them over email and and ask them how it went. It's like sit next to them and watch them use it and then keep making it better. Then you tried this product launch. Another great lesson. You may fail on Product Hunt. That's okay. You still gain, like you don't. It sounds like you tripled your quadrupled your user base from 10 to 30ish in a failed Product Hunt product launch.\n\nUh, you also said you've tried paid which didn't work. You tried influencer marketing didn't work. So basically all the paid stuff didn't work, but that's great, great lesson. I think people generally don't want to be doing that kind of stuff. The point you made about starting to share it in public, I think is really interesting. A lot of people post stuff on LinkedIn and everyone like it's cringey. There's a lot of people building in public. Who cares? What are you building? I don't know. I don't care about what you're building. What is it you think stood out about the way you approached it? Is it this tool you built that tells you how to post really viral stuff? Uh, what do you think you did that allowed that made people care? Is it like the small community you're already a part of in Israel and the tech scene? Like, is that a big part of why you think it worked? Is there anything else that might be helpful to folks that are thinking about building in public and being successful there?\n\nSo, first a disclaimer. I feel like I had some very small, not audience, but like I had plenty of like LinkedIn connections before. And so everything started from LinkedIn, right? Till this day, right?\n\nYeah. So now that the acquisition story is is getting crazy all over the world. So getting a lot of followers from a bunch of like different, different, uh, uh, social media platforms, but started with LinkedIn. Think the fact that I was like the CEO of this company, um, previously, like had some people around me in my connections. So again, you have to have like, if you're writing to like something that I told a friend a few weeks ago, building public is great, right? But but and and other, other like other channels can really work, but at some point you have to like take a bet on one channel that you see it's working. So, like if you're writing posts week over week and like you get five likes, it's likely not going to change drastically. Um, so and again, I tried a bunch of things. Uh, influencer didn't work. Okay, just put it aside for a second. Let's, let's see if I can find a channel that works. So yeah, I, for the building public, I was trying to be as honest as I could and and just write the good, the bad. And I think also the fact that like I wasn't a venture, like I wasn't a, a VC funded company. I didn't try looking the best or show, hey, look at my amazing metrics or like make everything looks like really pink and really great and I'm the fastest growing, whatever bootstrapped company in the world. I think just writing really about the good, the bad, and the ugly and just being very realistic and sharing the learnings along the way. Again, that this is specifically for my audience, right? So my audience were builders. And so I'm not sure that it, it, it works to any other product category. But yeah, just being very realistic and doing posts from the deepest like technical tech and how I optimize LLM to just sharing some, uh, some feelings or growth. People like to see numbers. People like to see charts. And also even there, even in the building public, like I would ask my friends beforehand that I knew that they were the the target, like what do you think of this post? Is it interesting? Is it not? Like, do you get, do you see value out of that? And it's like almost like a product that you're releasing out there. It's the same thing.\n\nOkay. This is really interesting. So being being honest really effective. Feels like there's like this underdog element of being a solo founder, not VC funded, adds to it. Also, just sharing really interesting learnings, things you've learned yourself that innately people find interesting because you didn't know this stuff. Uh, and also just like fun stats and charts and things like that. Building a tool on Base44 that can help you make these tweets better. Also, there, I think it's important to note you had a network ahead of this. Like you had people, you had followers, you had connections. It wasn't like starting from zero. What's like a rough sense of just like, I don't know how large your network was. What's like a way to think about that so folks are like, \"Oh, wow. I'm nowhere near that.\"\n\nI don't think it was very big. Um, I think it was like maybe a few thousand connections. Nowadays, it's few tens of thousands, but like you start seeing some engagement and and once you do that, especially when like saying, \"Okay, this is the channel that I'm going to put all like on my way to.\"\n\nOkay, that's a really important point, too. It wasn't like put cross to Twitter and Instagram, all these things. It's pick one and just nail that.\n\nYeah. Till this day, I think that like posting for me posting on Twitter was was a waste of time. I at some point like, okay, I saw LinkedIn succeed and I was like, okay, let's do the same thing on Twitter. Now I have like a better following on Twitter, but yeah, like it was it didn't really work. So I was spending a lot of time where like from LinkedIn I saw like the the highest ROI and it could be very different for different founders, for different products. It could be Reddit. It could be like, uh, opening opening up a Substack. Like it could be very different things. For me, that's what worked. And like once you see something work, just double triple down on that. Keep on like, don't try to spray and play. It doesn't work at this stage. At least for me.\n\nThat is really great advice. It aligns with what I often see with traditional growth engines. You there's like SEO, there's pay, there's sales, there's virality, word of mouth. And usually a company grows mostly through one. And yeah, LinkedIn, interestingly, was your vector of growth. Also, just this incentives piece is really interesting, a really cool tactic. So, the tactic here is incentivizing people to share what they built on Base44 and they get credit to build more. I've never heard of that before. H how do you actually do that? Do they send screenshots or something? How do they get credit?\n\nThey, they literally like early on, they sent me emails and I would tag them again with a with an app in an LLM. Like there's their support is a whole different topic that we can speak about for hours. Like\n\nHow do you run support when you're solo? Which is a huge topic, but like they would send, um, I would say, hey, write a post, paste the link back, send me an email with like the link, and I'll give you credits. And so at some point, I automated that because I couldn't really manage like the whole thing. Uh, but yeah, because you couldn't really like connect to like the social APIs, and so it was hard. So, it's like, just send me the post. I know exactly what you mean with the support challenges of being a solo person with a newsletter of a million people. I get endless little things just come up. I am really curious to hear how you solved it. Let's not get into it. In terms of being solo, actually, I haven't asked this yet. How long were you actually solo? When did you actually hire your first, first second person into the journey? Of the six months? So, the first person started two months ago. So, a month and a half before the acquisition. So, I was running mostly solo. I think, but like when he started, I already knew that it's headed there to acquisition. Um, yeah, and also at some point, like once I saw that the chances of this happening grew. So, yeah, I hired like the best people I know, cuz I know that like I have now this few years, if not more, that I want to build an awesome, like I have to build this to be really big, and I need the right people around me. And it's not anymore about like, let's try and be as profitable and as fun as possible. Like, let's literally take a bigger bet. Um, that's where I started like bringing in people that I knew, the best people that I knew to kind of like help me build that. Also, like the way the deal is structured, not that I can share a lot of details around this. Like, okay, there's like the 80 mil that got published, that's the initial payment. And then there's this equity piece, which is really interesting because I think they, we structured the deal in a really win-win situation. Um, but then a lot of my compensation and a lot of like the upside is actually based on that, like other than the 80 mil. And so I have both the financial interest, also the personal interest in building Base44 to be as big as possible. So, in the month before the acquisition, I had the team starting to scale, but also basically for like became more profitable that I could afford myself to bring in more people. The first hire was that an engineer? Would what did they do? Actually a product person. Uh, like a product manager. Yeah. Well, it's someone I've been working with a lot, and he's like a jack of all trades. So, he can go into like LLM logs and look at like mistakes and fix the prompts. He can write Python scripts to analyze things that we do. Uh, he can start implementing analytics into the product. So, like a very technical product person that could wear many hats. That's what you want when you were starting out. Like at some point, I was like, his name is Yoav. Some point I was telling him, hey Yoav, you take golf now. And I was like, I haven't done golf anywhere, right? No, you take now, like try and let's try new challenges, let's try those kind of things. So you want to bring in someone that at least the field style that can do many different things. Okay, that's really interesting. Let's finish talking about growth, and let me share stuff you've shared already about what worked. And then there's a few more things I read that you did that I'm curious how big of a deal they were. So first, you just grabbed a bunch of friends, used this product, used that to learn what to build. You tried Product Hunt. Sort of effective early stages, it was ended up being really effective. Then you had another launch that was like you said, broke the Product Hunt algorithm. How many users did that drive? Was that like a huge inflection, that second Product Hunt launch? The thing is, like things happen so fast that I didn't really implement any like data like stuff like that, so I don't really know how many users it brought. But I remember, I remember first, like the community around Base44, again, is like one of the most incredible communities that I've seen. It's a very strong one, and like they're all in, like the writing, so that they all were very excited about the Product Hunt launch, and I was like, let's skyrocket Base44. And then I wake up and I see the weirdest things, like Base44 is not even in the top 10. Um, and I was like, I know for a fact there's like a thousand people already voted by the time it was noon. And noon in Israel, right? Very early on. It's like I see people write, I see more posts on LinkedIn saying people should vote for Base44, and I actually see upvotes. Um, and so till this day, I don't really know what happened. So, one of the community reached out to the support team for Product Hunt and saying, you guys should like check out your algorithm because something is not right. Like, just even look at LinkedIn's like search for Base44 Product Hunt, like you'll see this many posts. And they're like, \"You know what? You're right. We fixed it.\" And then we jumped to like the first place. We were like 500 upvotes. The delta was 500 upvotes from the second place. Oh my god. I've never seen that. Yeah. So, it was it was fun also seeing kind of like the community rally for this. Speaking of community, did was that all in WhatsApp? Or did you manage this community? WhatsApp is a surprisingly really good tool to get feedback from the community. Obviously, like it's not a great tool for the community is growing so fast. So, it blew past like a thousand or 2,000 or 5,000. I don't even remember what's the limit on WhatsApp. Um, but till this day, like the WhatsApp community, which was like very early on, is such a great place to get feedback. Um, it's also even, oddly enough, it was when it first started out, it was my best place to find out if the product is up, if there's like slowness, if there's like bugs, cuz people write like really fast and I can see that. Um, but obviously at some point, we turned to like more scalable solutions like Discord, Reddit. Um, yeah, those those things. Um, and then just keep on sending product updates via email. Okay. There's another couple levers I've read about, and then I'm going to move on to a different topic. One is this hackathon you mentioned that helped you grow and become more aware. Uh, the other is you did a bunch of partnerships, which is really rare for a company of your size. So, just talk about those and what that did to the business. At one point, one of the things I really liked about building Base44 is that I saw people doing like building apps that were really like incredibly positive and like doing really good in the world. And so, and then it's, I think something really interesting right now in no-code building in general is like once you actually scale software, you can also scale the impact the software does. So you can have like nonprofits build themselves tools. You can have people that build apps for education and neglected domains. They didn't really have budget because there was like no business out there. And once you open this up and make it super cheap to create software, then it's becoming. And so I wanted, and this was like early on, like we were at the 5,000ish, 10,000ish users. Um, and so I said, \"Okay, you know what? Let's do a hackathon where we open up for everybody to build like apps that do good in the world.\" Um, if I had no budget back then, so I was like, \"Okay, this is going to be a 5k hackathon.\" Like the price is going to be 5k. And it was your own money you were going to give away? Yeah, it was like the profits that Base44 did at the same time. And then a lot of people started registering and a lot of teams. Uh, it ended up being 3,000 teams. So, really big. I think like the largest, I think it's the largest for-good hackathon so far. And then started getting sponsor requests because it went all over social, and all of a sudden I found myself with a very like nice back then, like smaller business, partnering up with Amazon, with Google, with MongoDB, with Deloitte, like with really great companies that, one after another, stood behind this hackathon, which was so, so fun. Like those are awesome teams, like the ones that we partnered up with. They open up their offices across the globe to have like teams be there, and the prices went obviously very high. Um, I think this is this will likely be one of the top moments in my career. Uh, was very, very empowering, very like people built a lot of like interesting things. I remember this person building a tool for her grandma who has Alzheimer's, and building an app which is essentially a game to help the grandmother to memorize family members with photos and names, and like so many interesting and great and impactful applications. I love that there's benefits to the hackathon route, which other no-code tools are taking, not just growth, but also just good feelings and just building community and seeing what people are doing, like meeting people excited about what you're building, so so many side benefits. Okay, before we move on from growth, is there anything else that's worth mentioning that worked really well, or just like, they think that people think will work and just didn't work for you that you didn't already mention? The last piece, but people talk about that a lot, is that velocity eventually is a growth engine. So, like part of like building in public is you want to put content out there that people really like to see. And so we joked about it, but it's really true. Like people like to see charts, and they like to see numbers, and it gets them attached to like this project. If they're saying, \"Oh, I wonder what's going to be profit next week, or I wonder like how much money is it losing, and how can you optimize?\" And like they get attached to that. Um, and I think also velocity is to some degree the same thing because if your product evolves really fast, and you're putting features out there like every other day, people get attached to that, and people like it. It's, I remember people commenting on my post saying, you know what, like it's moving so fast, I have to try it now. Um, and so this is part of it, like velocity solves for so many things. Like most of my thoughts when running Base44 is like, how do we increase velocity? How do we increase velocity? It's going to solve every product problem you have, or most of them. It's going to solve some of your marketing challenges if you're smart about it, and you're putting the content out there, and you're making everything like a mini launch. Uh, so I feel like that was also a great growth tool. That is a really good point. Uh, clearly everyone in the space understands this as well. I want to talk about the acquisition piece, but a couple quick questions that have been on my mind. One is just, what is the tech stack that you built on? Because I think a lot of founders are like, \"What the hell do I build on? How do I, what will help me move fast?\" So get as geeky as you want, just like what are the tools and infrastructure used to build Base44? Render.com. Oh my god, this is, I like the, honestly, they're not paying me anything. I wish I would have invested or anything. I don't think I ever spoke to someone senior there. Um, holy, like this was so much fun to work with and still is. Like, I remember in my previous company, we had like large teams of DevOps building processes for us to push to production. So Render.com is like, um, how does it call like this? Um, it's a cloud, like it's like a very, like built on top of AWS. You have a bunch of easy, easy to manage processes, um, and easy to like start up web apps and scale them and so on. Um, and it's just Render. It's not like a fancy version of Render. It's the word Render.com. Oh yeah, I just looked that up. Okay, cool. Yeah. So this is like everything that has to do with infrastructure. I manage both the website, the platform, and applications itself, because Base44 is like a complex ecosystem. You have the user applications that have to be isolated and separated from the platform, that has to be isolated and separated from the websites, like a whole thing. Um, MongoDB is really good when you're no-code building, especially when you're building a no-code platform, because schemas change a lot, and it's not necessarily like users, LLMs don't always understand what the user is trying to send, so they keep changing the data schema. Um, and I feel like this has been a right choice. Obviously, Cursor, but again, I was spending 20, 30% of my time just optimizing for making the whole repository LLM suitable. So, by the way, those are concepts that I also implemented in Base44. But one thing that I kept doing is I tried making the LLM write as least code as possible. Like when you're trying to implement a feature, try to get to a place where it can implement the feature entirely without you writing code, but that the LLM would write less code, as little code as possible, because then when the LLM tries to like, when the AI tries to like implement the entire feature from scratch, there are more places where it can make mistakes or get confused. There are more things that it needs to save in the context when you ask it for a follow-up prompt or something like that. And so I built a very high-level, very opinionated infrastructure, like code infrastructure, right? It takes care of like the entire thing. When you build a new feature, it takes care of like the entire, like the CRUD, the authentication, the database, like everything that has to do with that. So that when you ask the LLM to implement a new thing, it writes very little code. And by the way, this is also true for Base44 is like provide the LLM with a really good infrastructure and SDK, and have the LLM, like the LLM still has the flexibility to write the entire feature because it's code, but make it so that it doesn't need to spit out too many tokens. And obviously, everything that has to do with rule sets. There's one controversial take for me working with LLMs is don't use TypeScript, use plain JavaScript, use ES6. It's easier for models to write code this way. So the front end for Base44.\n\nFor the platform, I mean, um, is built in JS6, not TypeScript, and I feel like this has been working well. Part of the reason why I haven't written a single line of HTML or or JavaScript in the past, like Jesse does this really well. Um, and another thing that works really well working with AI is a lot like try to push as much as possible in the same repository instead of like separating the front end and the back end. It's easier to give like the context to the to the AI of like both what's in the back end, what's in the front end. Um, besides that, so my stack is like the back end is in Python. I feel like people can be very judgmental about that in terms of performance. I haven't gotten into performance issues and there's like a lot of a lot of traffic to Base44 and every now and then people try to do B44 and still the server holds. So I feel like if you're building it the right way, uh, Python is just a very great language to do that. And another maybe interesting take is, uh, because many of the the new apps and products are being built to some degree around LLMs. So one of the things that I use is for the LLM that actually writes code in B44, I use I use a mix of different models for different tasks. So Cloudflare, for example, does a really nice job with first the initial prompt, like writing the app from scratch. Then everything that has to do with UI is just fantastic, like design is great. But then for example, Gemini is really good when when you get to a very complex, uh, or like very complex problem, or you need to figure out an algorithm, or Cloudflare got stuck in some bug loop, which happens a lot when you code. Um, and so I have this pipeline that tries to figure out the user prompt and then, um, route it to the right LLM. Uh, which I feel like has been working pretty well. Wow, that was, uh, extremely interesting. Uh, in this routing, does this is this what you do within Cursor or you do this within Base44 based on what the person's working on? Base44. Yeah, I don't think has this. I wish they I think there's like maybe an an auto option for like, but in Base44 is like when users ask, that's awesome. I first try to analyze what they're asking and then figure out what's the right to use. That is so cool. So it's just Claude and Gemini, those are the two they use for Base44. Yeah. Well, all of those tools basically for Cursor, all the coding tools, I use the same, uh, paradigm or I don't know if you call it or method, which is like you have the heavy guns, which is usually either Cloudflare or Gemini. And then Cloudflare and Gemini usually, um, create the high-level, uh, solution or high-level kind of like what changes do you want to make to the file. So not writing all of the file from scratch every time. Cursor does that basically, like, and so writing like the only the chunk of code that needs to be implemented in high-level. Then you you get like smaller, faster models like Flash or Faux Mini from OpenAI to implement to kind of like, uh, to patch the code inside this file. Okay, one very tactical question and a completely different direction, uh, product question, activation, getting people to an aha moment feels like something that, uh, is core to retention, something that comes up a lot on this podcast. Is there anything you learned about getting that right? Anything you did that was really successful in getting people to see the value of Base44 really quickly and and in that start sharing it, using it? Here's one interesting thing that that I learned that I think, uh, was counterintuitive to me because you always like you always want to build the best product out there for your users. Uh, but sometimes it contradicts the aha moment or how fast can you get users to do that? First, when when I like when a few months ago or more than that, when B44 started before actually implementing your app. So you'd say something like, \"Hey, create a a task management app.\" And before implementing that, because a lot of times you get this, uh, not super clear request from the user, I'd show the user like the LLM would first before even writing code, it would first generate, uh, user flows, like almost like a PRD or like, but something that's more digestible to folks who have like are not coming from from the space. Uh, so it will generate user flows. It will show it to you like, hey, you want to create a a task, and then you could you could say, yeah, yeah, so maybe I want to add some files and stuff like that, so it will show you what it's going to generate to make sure that it understands you, and then you click okay, and then it will generate the app. This was actually something I ditched because too many users, um, even though it was good for them and it was the right product decision to do that because you'll you'll create like better apps doing this. Okay. But the conversions to like get to the aha moment, uh, were not super high, and also like not super like, I think one of the the key to the aha moment in the coding world or at least in Base44 is like, holy, like it actually understood me, and you see the app, and if you have like a stage in the middle, it makes a surprise, like slightly less surprising. So I think I ditched that, and that was a a nice lesson that that I don't know actually how to define the right way, but it's like get your users as fast as possible to the aha moment. Sometimes there's a price to that. Make sure it's not too big. But sometimes there's a price to that because at least when you're building B2C, and it's all new to me because I'm not coming from the space, but at least when you're building B2C, like the attention span is so low, really. Uh, so you want to get there in like a minute or two or three. Uh, and then from there, okay, later on ramp up the features that you want to you want to actually put there so that it can be like the right product for for your users. That was an awesome insight. Thank you for sharing that. That's actually something that I think will help a lot of people. Okay, final topic. I want to talk about the acquisition process. Uh, founders often look at this as like the dream. Oh my god, I sold my company millions of dollars, but I know it's always stressful and hectic and wild, and you know, the work only begins. You know, you know, you're not like I'm off. You have to keep building this thing. So, first of all, just had the acquisition conversation start. Wix reached out. I think back then there's like a lot of folks from the community, um, were posting saying, \"Hey, we should definitely buy Base44 before it gets too big or something like that.\" Um, even though like we're not playing or competing in the same category, but it was clearly it's going to be. Why were they recommending Wix? What was just the connection there? First, because of the Israeli, like, uh, the Israeli ecosystem. Got it. But also folks were building websites with Base44, and so it's kind of like the same the same. Obviously Wix is, yeah, obviously Wix is an incredible product, um, for building websites, but a different approach from from LLMs. Now it's now definitely getting there. And so I got there, the management team, like Wix's management team is so friendly, um, and and such great guys, and I remember sitting there and the first, I think the first sentence that I was, first thing that Avishai, the CEO, told me is like, \"Hey, everybody's been saying that we should buy you, maybe at least it's worth the talk, and we're here to help.\" Um, and I think early on we've explored like, at least in my mind, like, yeah, it seems like those are that's a great team to work with. They're definitely in the same space. There's a lot I can benefit from partnering up together. So, it wasn't clearly an acquisition, um, like on the acquisition path. And Avishai, the CEO, is like a very seasoned, very experienced, and helped a lot of entrepreneurs in the B2C space and specifically in Israel to to kind of go and succeed. And so I remember, um, meeting him for a few nights of like just, uh, eating some steaks and just chatting about how to go Base44 and just literally just getting there to get advice. Um, and so at some point we saw first that we have great chemistry, both with him and and with the rest of the team, which I think is really, really crucial, especially if they're buying a solo, like this is a very unique case, but especially if they're buying like a small team. Um, I think it's crucial for the buyer to make sure or to feel like they're going to have really good connection and chemistry with the founders, with the key people, because eventually it's like, I remember like the key, one of the key reasons where we were like debating together whether whether I should I should join Wix or not is like one of the key things that we've put on the table is, oh yeah, and it's going to be a lot of fun working together. Um, and I think also being a person that's going to be fun to work with is a key, especially if you're if you're not like a 500 people, uh, company that someone's buying. If you're like a big company and it doesn't really matter like you're buying the operations, you're buying the product. If you're a small company, they're just starting out and getting some great momentum, you have to be a person that people would love to like want to work with for the next few years. And so this was critical. Uh, um, I think the best, like the best place, uh, and this is not easy to get to to this position, but the best position to negotiate such a deal or or even to get there is to be also very fine with the other path of not getting acquired. In some ways, it's like it's weird, but it's like, uh, it's like in dating when you when you're in the first couple of dates, you don't want to show too much interest because then it's, uh, I think also I was in a position that I was saying, \"Hey, if it works out, it's going to be amazing, and if not, it's going to be amazing. It's going to be either either way fun, or obviously I wanted it to work out.\" Yeah. And the last thing I think is, um, I don't know if it's suitable for everyone, but I'm very happy with the structure of the deal with the earn-out piece because I feel like it's still, I still show up every day to work, and and it's been only two weeks, but feel like it's going to be like that for years. And like I have a personal investment in the business and its success. So, it's really, I feel like it's better than just selling the business and just spending the the next few years and wanting to disappear. I I love that part of the deal. Uh, you could be a billionaire if it does well enough. I I don't know the deals, but in theory. Um, let me ask, so I know a part of the story also is that when you were signing the deal, the, uh, the war with Iran, basically broke out. Tell that story. So, I was trying to not, uh, I wasn't nervous throughout the process, but this like this is like a huge deal for me, right? It's going to change my life. Probably will change my kids' life. Um, and when we kicked off the process, uh, we wanted it to be fast. Also, it's like it's not like B4 was like a very old company with like a lot of baggage. It's like there's no legal, there's no like it was very easy. The due diligence process was very fast. And I remember I us saying to the to the lawyers and to our great kind like two firms that we work with, uh, it's like until until Thursday night, that's it. We're signing Thursday night. No matter what we do, let's do it. Like, let's wrap it up and make sure that we're aligning to sign Thursday night. And we get till Thursday night. It's 2:00 AM. We stopped fighting over like small details. Um, and the lawyers have agreed to everything, and I was like, \"Okay, just send it out for signatures. We said Thursday night.\" And then lawyers were saying, uh, \"Yeah, we agreed on everything, but we need still need to kind of like change the wording and so on, and we're very tired, like we're not going to do it the right way. Let's wake up tomorrow morning and do that.\" And I remember as like I remember going to sleep, and then 4:00 AM waking up like this announcement, like, \"Hey, a war broke out between,\" and I was like, \"Again, this is so classic. I'm sure that the deal will like, I'm not like I wasn't sure like I was, I was like, holy, I can't believe this is happening. It's such, it's such an insane turn of events.\" But everything went fine from there. We woke up the next morning, um, and signed the papers. Um, yeah, it was, as I said before, it was definitely the least boring month that I had in my life. I was just thinking back to exactly that phrase that you shared. Oh man, there's just so many parts of the story that are so interesting. It's a hero's journey story in so many ways. Mayor, is there is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with? Anything that we didn't touch on, um, maybe just last piece of negative advice for founders that are trying to be on this start on this journey or on this journey they think might be helpful to them. So, first, before getting to the to the negative advice, if there's like the only thing that I would say really, if there's anyone from the Base44 community that's actually listening to this, I am so grateful. Like this community has been so supportive. Um, and many times I'm saying, \"Okay, maybe I did this right and that right,\" but I I don't, it's hard for me to think about what I did, uh, so many things right to get like this community behind the product. And so I'm go so grateful for the community. So if everyone's listening, uh, really, I'm I'm hoping to serve everyone better. Um, what not to do. Um, yeah, there's there's plenty. Don't just make sure that at least 50% of your time you work on some on the parts of you that you really like and that you're really good at. You know, there's like this plenty of ways of saying that and different diagrams that they show you is like what you're good at, what what you want to do, uh, what's fun for you, what's energizing, what's not. I think 50% of it should be in like this sweet spot of you're doing the thing that you're genius at, like your genius zone or whatever they call it. Uh, and they're so fun because that's what keeps you up like showing up every day. And it's unbelievably different, um, than than being a very talented person, a very skilled person, but doing things that\n\nYou either don't like or, and it's fine. Like, everybody does things that they don't like. And in every job, there's like those places, but keep yourself in the zone of genius. Um, I think that's really crucial. Um, and I feel like in the last few months, I've also met plenty of, like, really great and friendly CEOs, even from the Israeli ecosystem, like for public companies, right? Wix and Minded.com and so on. And they're all like, obviously, they have to do a lot of different things. And being CEOs of public companies, like, you have to manage a lot of things, a lot of logistics, and I don't know, bureaucracy. But they all have, not tact, like, major, or to some degree, major part of their job is doing something that they really like and they're really good at. Like, whether it's product design, whether it's building a marketing machine or something like that. I think that's critical.\n\nYeah, that's the biggest thing. Um, and also, it's like, and you probably hear this nowadays on every podcast, but it's the best time to build. Um, and it can be really life-changing just starting out something that you really like. Where I feel like we're at the age, at the start of an age that's going to be bigger than the revolution that the internet did. Obviously, I think now it's becoming clearer to anyone. And so, just building what you want is becoming so much easier. Just do it. Do something that you like. I think it's going to be, for a lot of chances, going to be life-changing. And if not, at least you'll have very little regret in the future.\n\nMayor, I'm going to skip the lighting round, but I'm going to give you because it's approaching midnight your time. I want to make sure you get some sleep. I'm going to ask you one question. This is something I meant to ask you earlier, but I didn't. Uh, Base44, what is what is that about? Why did you call it Base44?\n\nThis is the most, like, really the stupidest probably reason that you hear for a name behind a product. So again, Base44 was not intended to be like a very large scale, like the global phenomena that it's becoming right now. I wanted to have base in the name because I feel like that's going to be the base of where people are going to start building software or solve their pain and so on. And obviously, back then base.com wasn't available and I didn't have money to buy like a very fancy domain. So I started seeing, like, I think it was Cloudflare, I don't remember even what domain provider it was that started showing me some numbers. My date of birth is February 2nd, and so base22 wasn't available. And I said, okay, let's double it. And then Base44, I was like, I like the sound of it. It's almost like B64. And for the nerd in me, it was like, okay, B64 is one way to encode data from one type to another. And it's like Base44 is going to do the same. It's like encode natural language into software. And I was like, okay, clicks, let's go with it. Um, it's good that it's memorable, the number in the name, but there's no real, like, very sophisticated reason behind it.\n\nThat has an amazing story. I love that you like B64 was cool, but I guess we'll all, there's a reason 44 could be cool. And it's not even Base42. There's all these numbers around there that people know. And it's like, no, 44, double my birthday, sort of like 64. That's amazing. Uh, it worked, I guess. I don't know. Maybe shows you the power of how a name doesn't necessarily make a huge deal. Uh, interestingly, a recent podcast episode was about how a name can make a big deal. So, there's both sides to it.\n\nMayor, this was incredible. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, congratulations on the outcome. I know this is just the beginning. I know the product is only going to get better. What a fun place to be. Uh, hope you get some sleep. Um, two final questions. Where can folks check out what you're building? Is it just Base44.com? Anything else they should know? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJust try it out. I think we're at a place where people really love the product. And for every user that we get, it turns out to be two or four later on because they're sharing it. So, just try it out, Base44.com, and build something that you like. And if you have a bit more time, just leave feedback so that we can make it better.\n\nAmazing. Mayor, thank you so much for being here.\n\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nBye, everyone.\n\nThank you so much for listening.
