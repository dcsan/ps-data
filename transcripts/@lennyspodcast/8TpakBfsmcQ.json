  "cleanText": "You built and led Facebook News Feeds. You shipped the Messenger app as its own app. You launched ChatGPT Enterprise.\n\nWhat's an important lesson you've learned about what it takes to succeed building something from idea to one to billions?\n\nYou have to plan your chess moves out in advance. You have to really think before you act and build systems that are going to let you go sustainably faster.\n\nWhat's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned?\n\nSometimes your product actually doesn't matter. At Uber, I learned this because really the price and the ETA at Uber was the product. Looking at it from a holistic perspective, we humans consume the entirety of the product. It's not to say that you shouldn't fix the bug, but it doesn't have as much of an impact as something that is more important to people.\n\nWhat's one specific thing you think will change in a big way with AI that people don't think enough about?\n\nEducation is going to change. My son, he was nine at the time, built a custom GPT that you can type in any topic and it would give you a sentence that had every letter of the English alphabet. Isn't that mind-blowing? I can already see his brain rewiring.\n\nWhat's one thing you look for in people you hire?\n\nIn six months, if I'm telling you what to do, I've hired the wrong person. It helps me and the person operate on a different level where the goal is not, did you hit this OKR? The meta goal becomes, are we calibrating enough? Are we actually getting to a spot where in six months you're the one telling me what needs to be done?\n\nWhat's something you've learned about what it takes to be a great product person?\n\nI think there are five different types of product managers. Number one is...\n\nToday my guest is Peter Deng. Peter is maybe the most under-the-radar impactful product leader that you have never heard of. I often say that the best product people are not the people on Twitter and LinkedIn sharing advice, but the people who don't have time to do that because they are too busy doing the work. Peter is the epitome of this. He was VP of product at OpenAI where he oversaw product design and engineering for ChatGPT and helped ship ChatGPT Enterprise, voice, memory, desktop, custom GPTs, and more. He also oversaw and built their first growth team. He was the first head of product at Instagram where he worked closely with Mike and Kevin and oversaw all product development including on content sharing, ads growth, even helped build out their design and user research functions. He was also head of the rider product team at Uber where he oversaw everything in the rider app including big improvements to pickups and drop-offs in Uber Pool and airports. He also helped the team launch new products including Uber Reserve, which is now approaching a $5 billion a year business. He also spent nearly 10 years at Facebook as their fourth ever product manager where he built and led the team behind the current News Feed product, the standalone Messenger app, also photos and groups and homepage and profiles. He was also chief product officer at Airtable where he helped the company systemize how they built products and transitioned to enterprise. He also led product management at Oculus. These days he is a general partner at Felicis where he's able to bring everything he's learned to more founders as an investor. He has never done a podcast before or shared any of these lessons or stories publicly. So you are in for a real treat.\n\nA huge thank you to Eric Antinau, Nick Turley, Lauren Motomedi, Joan Jen, and Sundeep Jane for contributing questions and topics to this conversation.

Thanks for having me.\n\nSo integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?\n\nIntegrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customers business data such as Google Drive files, Slack messages, or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.\n\nSo where does Paragon fit into all this?\n\nWell, these integrations are a pain to build and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from rag data ingestion to agentic actions.\n\nAnd I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.\n\nExactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts on competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like you.com, AI21, and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy. If you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out Paragon at useparagon.com/lenny.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Pragmatic Institute, the trusted leader in product expertise.

Looking forward to having a great time here.\n\nAs we were preparing for this conversation, we were jamming on what we should focus on. There's so much that we're going to talk about, but something that you said was really interesting, and I'm really excited to start with this, which is that you've uh you've always felt that you haven't been able to say all the things you really think and feel because you've been within corporations, PR people, keeping on message, and this is the first time that you feel free to share. First time. Okay. So, first of all, just how does that feel? Second of all, tell us something that you've been wanting to share that you can finally talk about.\n\nWell, it it feels really good. So let me ask I love it that you're starting with a spicy question here. Um and um let me share some more context behind it. Um it's you know I'm here to speak more freely but it's not really what you think. I'm not here to divulge any secrets uh from the companies but naturally I'm kind of a storyteller. I'm kind of an introvert. So this podcast I feel like I have the ability to go deeper with you on uh any topic and kind of add the context because I think the new without some of the context some of my spicy takes or whatnot might be taken out of context and just not having the time pressure not feeling like there's some you know PR message I have to hit is just really freeing. So, it feels awesome. Really, anything that is on your mind that you would find interesting to your to your listeners, I'm here for it. And yeah, excited.\n\nSomething I always tell guests, and I don't want people to take this out of context also, but I always describe myself as a a reverse journalist where I want the guest to be the best version of themselves. I never want to catch people off guard or just say something they never meant to say. So, that's a safe space. Okay. Okay. But still, is there anything that you want to share or that might be interesting to share that you've been wanting to share that you haven't been able to? Is there anything along those lines?\n\nI mean, always get this question around sort of, you know, AGI, is it coming? Is it going to is it going to solve everything?\n\nI mean, it's so interesting because, you know, when I was at OpenAI, it was around the time that people were really scared of AI and, you know, oh, it's going to, you know, get rid of humans or it's going to just, you know, do all these things. But with every technology, I think everyone's been just kind of taking some time to acclimate to it. And I think with AGI, it's a similar thing, which is it's so far out that everyone's like, well, is it is it what's what's our world going to be like? And the real answer is like none of us really know. But in terms of solving problems, I think some people believe AGI is going to solve everything, but I don't think so. Um, AGI is just necessary, but not sufficient. A lot of the value is still going to require a bunch of hustle from a lot of builders to really turn that new source of energy and channel it into something that we humans want to use that solves some of our problems. And that hustle is going to be required, that elbow grease is going to be required to really make AGI something useful.\n\nYour point is that people think AGI hits all of a sudden all jobs are gone. AGI is doing everything because I think this is a a optimistic message that things will be okay if AGI basically uh AGI being uh and I'm curious if you have a clearer definition but AGI being uh AI being just basically as smart as humans.\n\nLook, I'm I won't claim to be an expert on this at all. Um but I I just I think that with every technology that's come out, we've been able to harness it and it takes a lot of harnessing. I think I'm going to use that word very deliberately, right? I'll use something really basic what seems obvious today is that you know there was a time when databases were all the rage. It's like, oh my goodness, you can store a bunch of data and you can query it really quickly and like imagine all the possibilities. And I think that a lot of amazing entrepreneurs and builders, you know, build some really great products on top of databases, right? In fact, that's kind of the basis of all the stuff that we're seeing today. And it seems so obvious today, but I I don't know, maybe in in, you know, 10 years, 15 years when we look back, it's like, of course, it made sense that we have this super intelligent, you know, thinking machine, but it requires uh product builders to be able to go in there and say, how do we channel this energy to make it something that we as humans love to use and want to use?\n\nI love the optimism around this. It's just like things will not go crazy once uh computers are as generally intelligent as as humans.\n\nI I I think that's that's exactly the the the what I'm trying to say and I think that again every technology people uh have this fear right and I remember reading or sorry watching a documentary once and they were talking about how when the bicycle came out people were like oh my goodness this is going to be the end of all things and it again it sounds silly today right because you're like bicycles really but then if you put yourself in the context in the mindset of a previous generation which you know are the next gener generation will be looking back at this podcast in that previous generation. I think that, you know, again, I think optimistically things are going to be okay. We're going to adapt. Um, and this was actually one of the things that I talked about with my fresh friend Josh Constein at South by Southwest is this idea that humans will always co-evolve with technology. And I think that that co-evolution is already happening. If you take a look at sort of um there was a lot of uh a fear of AI just when ChatGPT came out but you know when you start to get familiar with it things that kind of things change and then you are able to to evolve from being you know fearful to uh familiar and to go all the way to having this this mastery of this thing of like oh my goodness like look at all the startups that are happening now all the things that we can build right and just over 18 months I would say we look back and there's been an attitude shift Right. And so I guess part of my optimism comes from if you look back 18 months and you look forward 18 months, like might it be the same thing for something that we're we're chasing now?\n\nLet me follow this AI thread a little bit more and then we can move on to other things. I feel like every conversation there's like a time to AI conversation and then it's like okay there's other things that also matter. So let me ask you this the question. What's what's one specific thing you think will change in a big way with AI that people don't think enough about?\n\nI think education is going to change in a big way. And I think a lot about this because um I'm involved in my kids school uh quite a bit and that's something I've done after I I left OpenAI. And what's fascinating to me is that, you know, watching my son who got to, you know, dog food a bunch of the Open AI stuff before it was public. I think that was uh I think I can safely say that that seems okay. And uh when he was was playing with like you know ChatGPT and some of the the latest models and he's he's uh he was nine at the time. I can already see his brain rewiring right he was starting to ask questions and he never heard the word prompt before but his like just this is how awesome the human mind is because he was exposed to this technology at an early age. Some things just are unlocked. Um, and I think that you're able to think differently. And I I'll give you a specific example of of what I mean here. You know, he you know, he goes to Python class, right? And he's he's coding. Now, I don't actually think he's going to have to code when he grows up. I think that's going to be a solved problem. But it's a very very valuable skill because I think learning to program is learning how to think structure in a structured way, right? In very semantic way, um, a systematic way. And you know he was he he was prompting uh ChatGPT with some really crazy things that I never even thought of. And one of the things was hey ChatGPT can you give me a sentence that has every\n\n\nA letter in the alphabet.\nAlong the theme of oceans or along the theme of space. And the reason this kind of blew my mind is because in traditional programming, you couldn't write that program.\nYou can't say to, you know, in Python, like, \"Oh, write a function that goes and and formulate.\" I mean, it's a really difficult function to write, but for, you know, him to be able to think of that prompt, which is really cool because he built a custom ChatGPT that you can type in any topic and it would give you a sentence that had every letter of the English alphabet, kind of like the uh, the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog, right? Like, isn't that mind-blowing? It's like that that he can now at age nine, he could think about that, whereas me at age nine, I was playing with Legos and like maybe Q basic, right? And so this idea of how young humans' brains will evolve because of this new tool we have is going to change the way I think we're going to do education, right? And I'll be very honest, I'm not an expert in education, but I just thought a lot about it, and you know, one one thing I'm going to be, I think it's going to be really important in the future is being able to figure out how to ask the right questions. You know, we humans are inherently inquisitive, but you know, being inquisitive and turning that into the right questions to, you know, prompt or ask AI, which is going to be again something that everyone's going to have access to, is going to be a differentiator for sort of what kind of work can be done, right? And I I I I um, the the analogy I'll draw is when when the calculator was invented, you know, people didn't stop doing math, right? They just did higher level math, and it frees the mind up to do other things and think more at a at a higher level of abstraction. And I think we got to prepare our kids on thinking about, well, how do you think at a higher level of abstraction? And this has happened before, right? I think Google has made memory kind of obsolete, like you don't have to memorize facts anymore, you can just Google it, right? And the next phase will be something around, well, code will just appear if you summon it. So what are the things that, you know, people will think about and the skills that develop that are at the next level of abstraction, right? That tap into our creativity, that tap into our curiosity? That's going to be really interesting.\nSo I think education is going to change dramatically, just like how progressive education in the past switched from memorization of like multiplication tables into something that's a little bit more, you know, kind of higher level, um, higher level thinking, and I think that's going to, that's going to be one of those big areas. M, this makes me think about an NPR story I was just listening to where they were following professors using ChatGPT to create their curriculum. There's a lot of talk of students using ChatGPT, cheating, you know, having ChatGPT write their essays, but teachers are using ChatGPT in a big way, and and then uh, students are rating professors uh, badly because they notice they're using ChatGPT for their curriculum. So it's kind of this like arms race. Well, well, but it's also interesting because then that's that goes further, show further that like, you know, the whole system has to change, right? Because again, I still believe that human brains are inherently inquisitive and that we still need development in some way, but how that's going to develop, I'm I'm fascinated to watch how that plays out. I want to get back to product, but first of all, I know something that uh, you think a lot about along these lines. This came up in many conversations I had with folks that you worked with is your uh, emphasis on the power and importance of language, being really good at thinking about the words you use, both in writing and speaking. Just talk about how you think about that, just the importance and power of language as a leader. I remember taking this class that really stuck with me in college. It was called Language and Thought, um, and it was taught by Herbert H. Clark, and he had this thesis that kind of blew my mind, which is that, you know, language actually affects the way you think. That's one of the parts of the thesis, and I once I heard that and read that in his book and listened to the lecture, I couldn't stop thinking about that because it just rang so true, right? I grew up speaking Chinese, and I think that there's a lot of things of just the Chinese language that, you know, I feel like I noticed I thought differently when I learned English, right? And there were some studies around this too. I think that there's I think in in in, I'm not sure exactly. I have to go check up on this, but I think in Russian, there there are two different words for like a blue. There's like a greenish blue and a bright blue or something. I speak Russian. Uh, and I my, but it's like uh, I was I I moved to the US when I was six, and so my Russian is not great. So I'm trying to think of this as you say it, but keep keep going.\nWell, I mean, I So, So then this is great. So I I I need to get a way to to to to validate this. But you know, from what I remember, because there were these two different words for these different shades of blue, Russian speakers who then learned English had an easier time distinguishing between these two shades of blue than and a faster time doing so than people who had just grown up speaking English. Um, so I read some studies on also there's some other languages that don't actually have a word for blue, I think, and then that's actually really hard for them to distinguish over time. So that really stuck with me, and and I think that it's kind of rings true. So when I, you know, how I put it in practice is that when I make slide decks, I gave a presentation to a class a couple weeks ago, and there were probably a total of 20 words on the entire slide deck, and I spent hours obsessing over them because I really wanted to make sure I captured the right essence of what I was trying to say. And I think that crafting is really important when you're working in product because if you're sitting down and you're writing a vision doc or you're writing a PRD, and you if you don't pay attention to the words you use and you're not intentional about it, those have downstream effects. Like people might misinterpret things, the connotations may not actually come through. And so I I really am very careful about it because I think that the there's a multiplicative effect and a downstream effect for using the wrong word. Um, and I I I really believe in that kind of language affecting thought, um, thesis, which is why I've just really, really paid attention to that. Yeah. And I I feel like AI can help you with that too. Yes. Well, actually speaking of AI, actually that's a really interesting point. I think it's really interesting and kind of poetic that and and and fitting that uh, the breakthrough in artificial intelligence came from large language models, right? Like that's it's interesting to me because you know, there's with every word in every sentence, so much of the knowledge is encapsulated and shaped, and when ChatGPT does something really interesting, I I tell people it's often times just writing Python code and interpreting it, and Python is a language yet again, right? So I think that there's something really interesting where like the condensation of human thought in language has is related to the LLMs and the advancements in area that we have today. I think it was Ilya Sutskever on Lenny Rachitsky's podcast where he was talking about how you may think LLMs are just like, \"Oh, just predicting the next word. What's the big deal?\" But in order to do that, it has to understand the universe and everything in the world that has ever happened and existed and everything anyone's ever written to predict the next word. Yeah. Love it. Yeah. Okay. So, let me let me zoom out a little bit and shift a little bit to just product in general. Sure. You've worked on and built some of the most iconic products in history. You worked at OpenAI, Facebook, Uber, had a product at Instagram. So, let me just ask you this question and see where this goes. What's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products or leading teams that goes against common wisdom? I think one thing that it's a really hard lesson that I learned at Uber, uh, which is sometimes your product actually doesn't matter.\nAnd by product, I mean kind of the pixels you put on the screen or things that you build in your in your in your um, uh, mobile app. Um, and at Uber, I learned this because, you know, it it it pains me to say this, but really like the price and the ETA at Uber was the product. And I think a lot of times, you know, people at tech companies think of the product as just this digital manifestation, but looking at it from a holistic perspective, you know, we humans consume the entirety of the product. And I think that's that was one of the things that I I learned, the lessons I learned that was like really kind of hard-hitting, right? That um, sometimes the pixels don't matter as much as you think, right? And you fix a certain bug. Um, it's not to say that you shouldn't fix the bug, but it doesn't have as much of an impact as something that is more important to people like a price or ETA. This happens a lot in, you know, B2B products where it's uh, not just about, you know, how uh, it's great that your product is is well-loved by its end users, but you know, does it make good business sense is one of those those hard lessons I learned as a very uh, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed sort of design-based uh, product manager uh, going into Uber. I think the other insight that I had or rather other thought I had the other day was just the idea that like so many of the tech companies today, this is kind of counterintuitive, so many of the tech companies that are most valuable today didn't really start with any technological breakthrough. They were built on some kind of technological breakthrough, and they ended up building a lot more technology, but really a lot of these companies like Facebook, for example, just put in the hard work, right? The elbow grease to especially in the early stages to take, you know, essentially a database of human connections and build something valuable on top of it and that keep on polishing and iterating that product and and coming up with new ones like News Feed and photo tagging were just, you know, kind of came out of just really paying attention to what people wanted. And some of the ideas are super simple, and it's not something that came out of the lab, right? So Uber, for example, took the fact that everyone had these GPS devices in their pockets, and they didn't invent the GPS device, but they were able to take that and the fact that people had cars and people wanted to kind of um, you know, get around and there was a human need, and they just put the connected the dots and put everything together, um, and eventually built a ton of tech to predict the right marketplace and pricing, etc. But largely, like that's a very valuable tech company, but it's largely an operations company. And I I want to give a huge shout out to my colleagues there who run, you know, kind of Uber Eats and and Uber uh, rides from a from a operations perspective because truly, like that was one of the biggest kind of business model hacks that I've seen, right? And so I I think that's you know, Silicon Valley gets lost a thought, it's like, \"Oh, this is a new tech company.\" Often times, some of the most valuable ones are just the ones that are just building what people need on top of existing tech. This is such, there's so much to say here. I I love it. Uh, and this is coming from someone that led the Uber writer product team uh, and worked at Facebook and head of product Instagram. You know, it's like it means a lot coming from someone like you, not someone, you know, that's like not in product especially. Yeah. I mean, I'm just to go further on the Instagram part, like it's the the idea was super simple. It was it was showing photos and and visual sharing, but the craft that Mike and Kevin had in putting in the hard work to get the product just right, that's what made it really take off, right? That's a great example. I I'd forgotten about Instagram. Um, but uh, how could I? But, you know, it wasn't anything that any other company couldn't have done, but it was that product taste that Kevin and Mike had and conviction that there's a certain sort of vibe, if you will, uh, that people wanted and building that and iterating. I mean, and look at it now. It's it's a it's a core part of our lives. Visual sharing, they really solved it. Yeah. I just had Mike Krieger on the podcast. Um, so it's interesting. There's two tensions here. One is just like the product doesn't matter in a lot of really successful companies. It's secondary to the cars, the drivers, the the GPS and the phone. And then on the other hand, uh, there doesn't need to be a technological breakthrough for to build a huge business. Is there, it's almost like if the uh, if there's no technological breakthrough, then the product matters, like Facebook as an example, basically it's like a database of connections, but what allowed and Instagram, what allowed them to be breakthrough, and there's, you know, classically competitors at the time, uh, was the experience was a lot better, and then maybe on the flip side, if the if the experience doesn't matter, then it's the breakthrough is on the operations and other. Does that resonate? Is that kind of what you're saying? It does resonate. I think I think both have to be true. But also I would say that like even if you did found a company that has a huge technological breakthrough, uh, very shortly, I think that, you know, kind of the the product experience will start mattering, right? Because you know, how long does that technological advantage last, right? Before humans wisen up to be like, \"Well, this is not the product I want to use. I want to use it a little bit differently, and this is more ergonomic for me, etc.\" So I think I think that that's what you said is is is a beautiful summary. I I also think that a point in time in a company's history will also determine what is going to be more important. This this is especially interesting for companies building on top of LLMs and AI infrastructure where you're essentially saying you don't need to have some kind of technological breakthrough to build something valuable if you can create a really special, unique experience that unlocks the potential of this super intelligence. I think that's right, and and I have some more thoughts on just sort of the companies that are building on top of LLMs that are just, you know, that's a slightly different thing, I would say. I think that for them, you know, having the right data and the right data flywheels is so important, like proprietary data especially, exactly. Um, and the flywheel part is is is just, you know, you can start with proprietary data, but the flywheel is really just sort of how do you continue\n\n\nTo maintain that and generate that, and the second thing is, again, it's the workflow, so it's the, it's the ergonomics of how does it actually integrate into people's lives, and that is going to be more and more important.\nLet's actually spend more time there because a lot of people are thinking about this.\nFeels like, feels like everybody's trying to start a company these days with, you know, AI enabling so much more, and so I think a lot of people are just curious where should they spend time.\nAnd so I think this is actually really interesting.\nSo what I'm hearing here is two things to think about to create any kind of mo defensibility against, say, foundational models coming to eat your lunch or other companies.\nUh, what sort of data can you uh, acquire that is proprietary and create a flywheel to generate more of that data?\nAnd then, um, the other piece is how do you fit into a very specific, like, basically vertical that you understand really well that fits into their existing workflow?\nIs that right?\nWell, it's again, this is this is something we can unpack for a long time, right?\nBecause, um, you know, with any product that you want to build, there's going to be incumbents that have distribution advantages.\nBut I do have this thesis that there are certain products that will be able to break through those advantages of the distribution of the other companies.\nUh, but you have to kind of overcome a pretty high bar of your product has to be so much better, right?\nThat's I think that's that's one thing.\nBut yeah, I think the data flywheel thing is really interesting because, you know, the the the models will get really good at whatever data you show it.\nAnd that's that's one of the things that people just think that AI is such a magic wand, but no, it's like if it's been trained on the right data, it's going to do the thing that it's been trained on.\nUm, it's very malleable.\nUm, so being very mindful of the data that you have access to to start your flywheel going and what you can do to keep on going with that flywheel is going to be a a critical thing for for anyone who's starting a company today.\nSo let's make that even more specific.\nWhen you talk about this, I think about this.\nThe CEO of Windsurf was on the podcast, and he talked a lot about how they have all this really unique data about which recommendations of code uh snippets people accept and reject, and they actually launched their own model, I think, based on that.\nIs that is that an example?\nAny other examples to make this work?\nThat's a perfect example.\nUm, there's some companies I've invested in that aren't public yet that have their own sort of take on that, which is um, really interesting to be able to uh, to take um, sort of whatever activity is in their product to get smarter at the thing that they are doing again, which is why I think the data flywheel and the the the workflow go so hand in hand together, right?\nBecause if you are solving something actually valuable for businesses, for people, and there's a lot of that, um, uh, attention that's being paid to a lot of work is being done through it, you're going to have that edge.\nAnd you know, this is where I see again, startups in very different uh, markets who have this insight, who understand this very deeply, and are not just trying to zero everything and be like, no, no, no, like this is how we're going to build it to make the product genuinely useful so that it can get genuinely more useful over time, and that is going to be amazing because, you know, as a consumer of any of these products, we're going to benefit.\nWhat I'm hearing here is also, if you don't have proprietary data or unique data, you can still have a chance by building this flywheel where you collect that data through your usage.\nFor example, Windsurf, they all built on Claude 3.5, and then now they have all this unique data, and now they're miles.\nYeah, that's exactly right.\nAnd this goes back to sort of something I might have mentioned briefly, but you got to have grit when you're building anything, right?\nYou got to be able to like have that vision, have that clear direction, and be able to really go chase that.\nI think that's really important.\nThe and to make uh your example of distribution being overcomeable, uh, a a great example I think a lot about, and we had the CPO, a a CPO, turns out there's many CPOs at Microsoft, I didn't realize how many CPOs they had, yeah, uh, and she, she t, I asked her about like, why didn't co-pilot, like, the fastest growing companies in the world, Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, Bolt, all these guys, like, co-pilot was so ahead of these these companies, and and these companies broke through uh, while Microsoft has distribution, amazing talent, infrastructure, all the things, early first mover advantage, and it's to your point, they were just building products that were much better, Cursor, Windsurf, all these like, Lovable, whole, I, I do believe there is a a level of product craft that will make it so that it's just worth it to switch or try something else, and there are a few products out there that I see with that, with this, I think Granola is one of them.\nThere's so many distribution advantages that Google Meet has, that Google, uh, Facebook start off.\nUh, Microsoft Teams has, uh, Zoom has, but they're just these tiny little product craft, delightful things that I really appreciate myself of like, yeah, they got it.\nThey have these little edges sanded down just right, and they've really figured out a way to really make it so delightful that it's like, yeah, I will ex, I will install this piece of software.\nYes, 100%.\nI will talk to my friends about this because it is so life-changing, right?\nAnd that we're starting to see that now.\nAgain, before I would say 18 months ago, it's like, oh well, who has the best model?\nBut think going forward, it's like really who has the best workflow and who has the best product?\nAnd we humans are just demanding.\nWe want the best.\nAnd so when that when someone is going to come out and produce something that's so well-crafted, I think people are going to pay attention.\nSo, a couple takeaways here is if you're trying to build an AI startup, a few uh things you should be thinking about that gives you a better chance of breaking through and winning is what are your data flywheels where you collect proprietary, unique data.\nHow do you build something that's in the craft is comes through and people are like wowed and want to tell their friends about it.\nGranola is a great example.\nClearly, Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, Rep, all these guys did that.\nAnd then it feels like there's just like a understand a vertical workflow really well and then someone's problem and solve that in a really unique way.\nYeah, you couldn't have put it better myself.\nAwesome.\nUh, let me ask you this because this came up in my chat with Mike at Anthropic.\nUh, and it's along these lines.\nSo I I was thinking about just what is what is product doing at Anthropic?\nSo there's building this basically a gigabrain super intelligence thing that's going to know everything and maybe build its own experience in the future.\nAnd then there's this like product team building this layer on top to interact with this super intelligent gigabrain.\nWhat is the point?\nWhat is the value of that layer?\nYou spoke to it a bit here of just like there's value in the experience and it feeling native.\nBut I guess let me just ask you that, just where do you think product goes at a company like Anthropic, OpenAI, where there's just the super intelligence that the team is working on and there's this like UX on top?\nI think those companies have just such an advantage because you get to work in the same building as the researchers, and I think that you know, uh, there there's that really kind of symbiotic relationship, close partnership between post training and and um, and product, where uh, you know, again, more and more, it's going to be less about the raw intelligence.\nIt's going to be about the fine-tuning of of what the model can do that that really resonates with people and what people want and also what the product trajectory is is going to be, right?\nSo I think that's going to, you're going to see that more and more.\nI mean, I think I think uh, you know, this is less about Anthropic, but more about OpenAI.\nI think OpenAI made a great move.\nUh, I am a huge Fidji fan.\nAs soon as that news leaked that she was going to join, I texted her, I was like, this is great, amazing, congratulations.\nI'm thrilled for her, for the company, for all of my friends still at OpenAI because it's just going to be this amazing leader coming in.\nI'm also thrilled as a consumer because some great products are going to come out.\nI think that really that close, tight-knit relationship between at any of these large model companies between post-training and and product is going to produce some really incredible stuff.\nFirst of all, Mike actually said very similar things that the more I did not, I promise you, I did not watch that even come out yet, so I believe you.\nUh, yeah, they, they, he had this interesting finding where he he put product people on like UX, product experience, front-facing product, and then he put PMs on the research teams and building models, helping models get better, helping researchers build uh, things, and he found that all all the leverage and wins came from the PMs working with the researchers, much less so on the product experience, and so he puts more and more PMs with that with that with that team.\nI I'm so thrilled to hear that because it's a little bit of it's very validating because that's what we did at OpenAI too, like we were very closely tied to the post-trading team, and so it was because of that tight collaboration that you see some of the advances of of of ChatGPT getting better at so many things, right?\nSo uh, it's great, it's it's awesome that we independently came to the same conclusion.\nYes, it's a good sign.\nOkay, uh, so we're talking about startups building new companies.\nI want to follow this thread a little bit.\nI feel like you've built more products that from zero to one to scale than maybe most anyone else across all the companies that you worked at.\nI'm gonna do a quick rundown of some of the things you've done.\nAnd uh, I'm I'm going to miss a bunch, but let's see.\nYou built and led the Facebook News Feed, the current version of it.\nYou built the new groups experience, chat, and messages.\nYou shipped the Messenger app as its own app.\nThat was that was one of your projects.\nYou uh, led Uber Pool, low-cost rides.\nUh, you launched ChatGPT enterprise.\nYou shipped voice and vision memory custom GPTs, just refreshing the whole design of ChatGPT, uh, many more things, a lot of work at Airtable, obviously also, uh, Oculus, these are just some examples.\nIn the intro, I'm going to try to go through all these things, so all that to say, I feel like you've seen a lot of what works and doesn't work building from idea from zero essentially to one to scale.\nSo let me just ask you this question, what's uh, what's an important lesson you've learned about what it takes to succeed building something from idea to one to billions?\nYeah.\nUm, thank you, and that was a good trip down memory lane too.\nUm, uh, when you read that off.\nSo I think the first thing I would say, and you know, going from zero to one is different than going from one to 100, and when you are in the one to 100 phase, which is a lot of the time that I spent, you know, is is in the one to 100 phase, um, we, you know, were able to, we quadrupled Instagram usage in two years, that was very much a fun ride, and there's a bunch of other examples at other uh, at other companies, but when you go to one to 100, I I think one of the things that you really got to take into account is that you have to plan your chess moves out in advance.\nYou have to really think before you act and build systems that are going to let you go sustainably faster because the zero to one is you're trying to find that product market fit, and then when you get to one to 100, you're trying to make sure you can get to hyperscale and and as fast as you can, right?\nAnd I've been very fortunate to be along the ride of of many of these products as they were going through that hyperscale.\nAnd the analogy I always like to use is that when you do that, you feel the G-forces, right?\nAnd you know, some people are like, &quot;Oh, yeah, I'm a pilot.\nI can fly at, you know, 35,000 ft.&quot;\nBut like the the, you know, feeling the G-forces of takeoff of a rocket is very different, right?\nAnd the thing that I've learned there doing that a few times is you got to build the systems that help you move sustainably faster, right?\nAnd sometimes you have to go slow to go fast.\nUm, and here's an example.\nSo, in building the News Feed, the current version that we have today, it really hasn't changed much from the time that we uh, built it.\nI don't even know, it was like 12 years ago or something.\nI don't know the reason why it hasn't changed much, but I like to think that it's because we put a lot of time and craft into thinking about the whole sharing loop and what are what is the uh, what is the what are the key pieces of it and how is it architected?\nWhat's the information architecture?\nAnd what does that whole flow look like?\nHow does it go from posting something at the top of the page to showing up in the News Feed to someone clicking like and then that notifications thing lighting up red and then that repeating over and over again.\nAnd I like to think that News Feed has stood the test of time uh, the current version of it because we thought very carefully about how people wanted to interact and how people wanted to consume information and also that whole loop.\nUm, and so when when that happens, then I think things are built to last, right?\nAnd I think the this I think this is the case at a lot of different companies.\nSo when I was at Uber, we we had a bit of a spaghetti string code situation on the rider app, but you know, taking a step back and rearchitecting things of like what are the core components and how do you actually make it so that the product selector can scale around the world, and here's a little known fact, like, you know, talk about grit and elbow grease, like Uber is not just as simple as like finding a ride.\nIf you've ever been to another country, like in India, sometimes there are no street signs, so you have to like pick up in front of this, you know, mini mart or whatever it might be.\nSo there's a whole team that worked on pickup and drop offs.\nThis was a large effort, and it sounds so boring, but it was so critical to Uber being able to scale because pickup and drop offs team thought about, well, how do you do it for venues, and that venues and finding that right abstraction means that you can have uh, a scalable way to to do pickups at airports and you know, configure different venues, and those systems when you take the time to build them in the one to 100 phase help you speed.\n\n\nUp massively, and that's how you get 4x users in two years.\n\nOr, on Messenger, we put a lot of thought into the infrastructure around push notifications, etc. We grew that product from zero to 4.7 billion messages sent per day in about two and a half years. And I think it really requires that forethought in building the right systems.\n\nWell, let me follow that thread quickly because that's really interesting. So, essentially, what you're saying is, once there's a phase of, once you find product-market fit, and I want to actually ask you this before you start planning when you're starting to scale, going from one to 100, your advice here is basically, don't move fast and break things. Don't ship MVPs. This is the time to really think many chess moves ahead about what you're going to need to get this to, say, a billion users.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's building the systems, and then that systems thinking will carry you really far. At least that's been my experience, and hopefully, hopefully, you can find the same way, but, you know, your mileage may vary, but yeah, that's exactly right.\n\nWhat's your guidance on just like when to do that? Because, you know, you can't, you know, you build something, okay, well, it's working. There's also this, just like, okay, let's just keep it going. Let's scale it as far as we can. There, in your experience, is it just like, what's the guidance on when to really step back and really think years and years ahead?\n\nGreat question. I'll say the first thing I'll say is that it's not a binary switch. It's actually a ramp rate. And so, when I've led teams, I've always believed strongly in this portfolio approach, right? And so, you know, famously, Google had the 70/20/10 portfolio approach. That may be the right thing for a more mature company. Maybe it's 50/50 if you're a startup, right? But you have to think about this in a non-binary way and in a way that's about scaling up and when do you need to put more resources behind behind that. So, every startup is going to be different, right? Every product that you're launching is going to be different, and then thinking about your portfolio approach and how much you allocate your time. That would be my advice, and it's, you know, it is really dependent on the stage that you're in.\n\nI think that actually is a nice dovetail to my second thing, if I may, which is, you know, when you're going from that stage of, of, uh, maybe, you know, one to five or one to 10, so not just fully one to 100. One thing I found to be very helpful is to measure everything. And this sounds again very simple, but, you know, just like how you wouldn't fly a plane without instruments, like why would you run your product without understanding the instrumentation and how it's doing, right? And so, one of the things I did in pretty much all the teams that I led, whether it was Instagram, Uber, Airtable, was all about, and ChatGPT2, one of the first things I did was always to build a growth team. And building a growth team is really interesting because it actually is a simple razor. It's a simple thing to think about. It's like, I'm going to build a growth team, but then you're going to uncover a lot of things, right? You're going to uncover how much stuff you have not yet logged and how non-rigorous you've been looking at your entire product. And it's, it's so funny because I've seen this movie so many times, the same movie so many times at every one of these companies where I remember walking into Instagram and I think asking Kevin Weil, like, \"So, how many users do we have?\" It's like, \"Well, we don't really know.\" And so, it's like, well, there are a lot, and we don't really know. And so, when you build a growth team and you hire the right growth leader, I've had the pleasure, uh, the pleasure of working with George Lee at Instagram, you know, some early growth folks at Facebook, Andrew Chen, at Uber, Airtable, I had the privilege of working with Lauren, who is currently now leading growth at Notion. So, I've been very fortunate to work with some really amazing people on my team. And when you hire the right person, they start asking all the right questions because when you know the archetype of person who is a growth PM will be like, well, wait, why is this happening? And let's get the data on X, Y, and Z thing. And that's when you realize you don't have X, Y, and Z thing logged, and after you have X, Y, and Z thing logged, you look at the data, you're like, wait, well, why is that happening? And then you're forcing yourself to go deeper into the analysis of doing some analysis of like, well, you know, what's correlated with what, and what are some hypotheses? And because growth leaders, growth product leaders are so into this experimentation side, it actually is this really easy thing to do is when you start building a growth team, it just begets all of the right questions being asked, and then it starts, uh, you know, kind of turning into all the right behaviors of of of taking something you've been building, which is seems like it's working, into a more rigorous system. So, that's like the zero, sorry, the 1 to 10 phase. I would say that really sets you up for the 10 to 100.\n\nWhat I like about this growth team advice is that a lot of people think of a time to hire a growth team to, we need to drive growth. What you're saying is there's a lot of second-order benefits, which is they help you figure out what the hell's going on and inform a lot of other things that are happening. People just actually understanding how things are going.\n\nAnd totally, and I think that the reason why growth team is the advice I would go with rather than to build an analytics team is because if you build an analytics team or a data science team, it's possible that no one's going to listen to them, right? It's like, oh, I have these insights. It's like, well, no one really cares. But if you have a, if you hire a growth leader, they are now tied to outcomes of driving growth, so they're going to be the ones who are listening and asking, you know, more questions and really partnering with that data science team to make your entire product and business more rigorous, and that just changes the DNA of your entire team.\n\nI want to talk about hiring, but is there anything else along these lines that you want to share of building new product scaling products?\n\nI guess the last thing I would say is like, I, I, I want to make sure that, you know, sometimes in the, um, in the pursuit of numbers, product folks lose sight of the importance of taste and craft. So, uh, maybe this is actually the dovetail into kind of building teams, but like, you got to have the counterbalances, right? And it's really important to give two people on your team different charges. One is like, go grow the product, and the other one is, wait, maintain that design, that beautiful aesthetic, that, that, uh, the craft that your, that your product is known for. And that tension is extremely healthy, right? And so, I saw, I've seen this at Facebook. I've seen this at Instagram. I helped create this at Instagram. This kind of healthy tension. Airtable, same thing. But just having ChatGPT, same exact thing. You have to have that push and pull on both sides to really stretch the gamut.\n\nThat begs the question, how do you actually do that? You know, a lot, you could talk about it. You could be like, okay, we need to make sure the experience is awesome, but also grow this number. Here's your goal. How do you operationalize that as like a performance review attribute thing? Is it culture? Something else?\n\nAs a leader, you have to set up your team the right way. You have to really think about your team as a product and what are the various pieces you need to really stretch the gamut of what you're, what you're thinking about. Um, and the teams that I've helped build are the most successful ones are a team of Avengers that are just like very different, have very different superpowers, but together, you as the leader are the one who's helping adjudicate any differences or, uh, any disagreements, but you're, you know, you're getting the best outcome when everyone's pulling and obsessing over a different thing, right? And that's important. It's important to create your balance and and really kind of increase the space that you're looking at and create those healthy debates. And I think a lot of people overlook that. I think some people think of, you know, people on a team as like warm bodies to do a job, but my philosophy has always been to think about what is the, what does the company need to be successful, and who's the best person who spikes at that one thing, and how do I make sure that that we get that person, and how do we make sure we get the other person and the other person? It's almost like you're playing an RPG where everyone has different sliders, and you have to create this super team where everyone actually spikes in different, in different ways. And that is something that I've had a lot of success with in terms of when you create that environment and you create that vibe, you're going to get a lot of mileage out of that team.\n\nThat is a really interesting answer. It's not one I've heard before. Essentially, you're, it's not like create the right incentives. It's hire people that naturally want to see the world in a certain way, and that creates a balance and tension, a healthy tension between, say, a PM and a designer and an engineer. That is really interesting because that feels a lot more sustainable than like, here's your goal, okay, but also when your goal is make sure, uh, the experience is great and people support tickets are down. It's just like, naturally, they need to want this to happen.\n\nTotally, and actually, there was a, I, I have a, a sort of a framework around, like, I think there are five different types of product managers that has kind of held true. So, this is a framework that just came out of a random jam at Uber when I was talking to some of my colleagues there, and we formulated this in terms of helping, uh, with hiring practices. Everywhere I've gone, I've also been like best friends with the recruiters because, honestly, my whole thing is like, got to build the right team. So, we have to really partner very deeply. And at Uber, we developed this, uh, this, this, this five archetypes of a PM. Um, and I've, to this day, I still think it's like actually exactly true, and it still holds true to this day. But is that interesting? You want me to kind of go into that?\n\nAbsolutely. I'm so excited to hear with you there.\n\nThese are the five that I found to be most enduring and actually the most like kind of different, right? And and when you talk about, I love the way you put this, Lenny, which is when you hire the right people and like how they're naturally motivated by different things, right? And so, these are the five that that we came up with. Number one is the consumer PM. So, this is the person that's like half designer, half product person, really obsessed over the details. Is it delightful? Is it crafted enough? Oh my goodness, this is three pixels off. I can't stand it. This is like making driving me nuts, like why is this so complex? I mean, these are the people that you think of as like, you know, you know, sometimes the quintessential PM is the consumer PM, but that's just one type, right? And, um, another type, just kind of on the side, we've talked about before, is the growth PM. These people are like half data scientist, half product person. They are kind of wired to think numbers first, and they have this kind of air about them that's like the best ones do, which is like, I'm really skeptical. Show me the data. Let's run a test and prove it. I don't believe you, right? And it's, and and I start with these two in the framework because they're actually really different, right? One, it's like, I have vibe. I feel the vibe. This is better. And the other one's like, no, I don't believe you. We should test this and prove it. And that's like a really healthy tension. I love, you know, having two people in a room like debating that. Like, great, we are going to get some good things done, and we're going to, we're going to move the product forward. The third type is, um, you know, kind of what I call the GMP PM or the business PM, right? These are like kind of half MBA, half product person. These are folks that are kind of naturally wired to start with the business model and think about what are the margins, like what are the opportunities, where's the value being created? And we had a lot of these at, at, at, um, at Uber, and they were the marketplace PMs, and they're just like, I loved working with them because their minds just work differently. They just thought about problems from like, well, what is the incentive here, right? And you, this is a fascinating type of mind to to work with. Um, another one, I, I found this is, it's, it's actually more nuanced than you think, is like, there's a certain sort of archetype that I, I call the platform PM, which is someone who's like really deeply wired to kind of build tools for other people. And at Uber, we had like internal platforms for like messaging or for, you know, building internal tools, and often times, these folks are overlooked, but it's like actually a really deep wiring because these are the people that are going to build the systems that are going to make you go faster, right? And that's what they love doing. Um, and the last one I would say, I used to call an algorithms PM, but now in the, in the, uh, in the, uh, the the world of AI, I'm going to rename this to research PM. And these are like half researcher, half engineer, half product person. And these, these minds are amazing. So, like, basically, they think, you know, you know, traditional Google search algorithm PM, right? But nowadays, it's like, who are the people who really have that product taste but deeply understand the tech and the, you know, the way the models are trained to go and affect that and build the most amazing product. So, those are the five. I still think, I, to this day, these hold true, and we might have been on to something the day that we brainstormed this at Uber, but, uh, yeah, I'm curious to hear your feedback.\n\nThis is great. As you're talking, I'm just like, here's that person. Here's that person. Okay, they fit here. Uh, this super resonates.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Contentsquare, the analytics platform that helps companies build better digital experiences.

Discover the insights you've been missing at contentsquare.com/lenny.\n\nSo just to summarize, there's consumer PMs, growth PMs, business/GMPs, platform PMs, and sort of research PMs. Uh, a lot of people call them AI PMs now. I feel like that's the term that's really popular. You have to evolve with the times. Yeah. But also the other part of the framework I find uh kind of interesting is that everyone's like a primary has a primary one and a secondary one. It's kind of like one of those like personality tests, right? And maybe we kind of did this just because it was hard to pigeonhole people and I, I myself don't think I was pigeonholeable, but I, I do think that people like, you know, kind of lead with one type of thinking and then also have the secondary thing that keeps them in balance. And so if you believe that and you apply it to your team, I'm curious to hear, you know, from your listeners like sort of if this does resonate or not. And you know, maybe this framework will help you realize that you're missing someone that that you should be not missing. What was your archetype when you were a PM? This is and and that's the other thing with personality types is the ones you hear, you're like, \"This is me. This is I, I own this, right? There's no doubt about it. I am a consumer PM uh and also a growth PM. That's that's my primarily consumer. I just I, I can't, I mean this is what I told you about, you know, the other products I've loved. I've see the, I can see the details that people put into it and I so appreciate that, but at the end of the day it's like you got to measure things, right? So that's what I am, but you know, again, everyone's different. I love your point about how a lot of people think of PM like they hear that first example, like, oh, I guess that's what I need to be because that's what everyone talks about when they're amazing product managers, but you're saying there's many other ways to be a successful PM. We did a personality test uh at Airbnb when I was there and one of the biggest takeaways was it's like this color test and you get a color green or yellow or red and like the team was all over the spectrum and so it was a really good reminder just you can be a different type of person and still be really successful in this role of PM and it's probably because of these different archetypes and different needs and roles of PMs, like there's this word product manager, but there's many things that PMs do. And also as an investor now, it's really important to see the fit of the founder to the market because if you put a consumer PM into like a really, you know, boring regulated industry, they're probably going to get frustrated and they're probably not going to see it through. Whereas like there's people that you look at, you know, the pitch and you're like, \"Wow, this is you are really passionate about this problem and you really care about building tools for others and this is exactly this is the Twilio PM or you know, whatever it might be. You're a perfect fit for this business and like that's awesome, right? So, I think that yeah, I, I love that what you just said in in the summary because I think there's no one way to be a PM and I think this is sort of the, hopefully this framework will get give people a little bit more space to be, you know, express who they really are. I'm curious if other functions also have these sort of archetypes like designers and engineers, but we don't need to get into that. How about if you're listening to this on YouTube, leave a comment of which of these archetypes you think you might be. What's your primary and secondary? I'll read them again. Consumer PM, growth PM, business GMP, platform PM, research PM. Love it. Okay. Uh, I want to talk about hiring. So, this actually came up a lot when I was chatting with folks that you've worked with, especially uh Nick Turley, who's head of product at ChatGPT, who were trying to get on the podcast because that's an uh what he's awesome. That's what I've heard. Uh, so he told me that the current head of engineering, the lead product engineer, the head of design and head of marketing at ChatGPT are people that you hired. Uh, also many of the people that you hired have gone on to do incredible things. You've shared a few of those names. Many of them have been on the podcast, which is the ultimate measure of success.\n\nSo let me just ask you this. What's, what's one thing you look for in people you hire that you think are that you think people sleep on? That you think people aren't paying enough attention to that helps you find amazing stars.\n\nThat's really flattering to hear that from Nick. Um, Nick is one of the best people I've worked with, period. In fact, I want to just do a quick shout out like folks at OpenAI, I are are pretty much the best people I've ever worked with in my career. When I took the job, I told the team this is going to be my last operating role and I'm going to leave it all on the field and I'm just going to go all out. And basically I spent probably as much time if not more time on recruiting and building the team um than I as I did sort of thinking about the product. And this is going back to sort of what I said earlier about I think you got to bring the right people together to have a huge impact. And often times leaders overlook this and they're like, ah, just a warm body. But truly, you know, people who have strengths in certain areas complement others with strengths in other areas. And when you build that team, amazing things happen. It's the mo, it's the best investment you can make. It's going to pay off so many dividends. So, I think that's my opening salvo in terms of like, you know, you got to get the everyone who's listening out there, you got to make sure you look at everyone in your team, you look at what you need and you have to get the best in each. And uh truly like you know in in in in my farewell dinner at OpenAI I think I I I close with just that that like look I don't even know what I would do after this because all the best people I've worked with are here. We have Ian Silber running design there. Thomas Dimpson, you know, Joey Flynn, Ryan Oor, Nick Turley was amazing person I met there. Joanne, I mean just I have so many people I'm missing, but you know, Coley on product marketing, Eric Antinau on the marketing comm side, on engineer, you, you, you, the name, the list goes on, product operations is is is stellar. I'm so proud of like honestly the pr the team that I built there more than than the products. Um, so I just wanted to say that like it's it's a it's a big thing that I really care about and I hope more leaders think about that too is like really be mindful of putting your team together and and think about that as a product and you have to really craft that. You have to really care about the team, right? Just to double down on that point actually before you get to the next tip here is I just love this answer, which is in you know, if I were to ask someone, here's hire, what's your hiring advice, what do you look for that people may not be looking for enough. Uh, I love that most of it would be like in that person, here's what you need to focus on and here's the interview question and but uh, the kind of your broad answer so far is it's not actually about the person so much as what is the team going to look like and where do we need spikes, where do we need to balance out the composition of this Avengers that we're building. Totally. Totally. That's exactly right. And so, so that being said, I, I guess I have uh, I guess on brand, I have two things I want to share about about sort of hiring the right team. Um, I have this saying, um, I actually have this like doc that I've taken around various companies called the PXD API, which is like, here's how to work with me. And in it, there's, there's um, there's a saying that I have, which is what I really optimize for for everyone that I support and everyone I hire, which is in six months, if I'm telling you what to do, I've hired the wrong person.\n\nAnd it's just kind of served me really well as on three different levels, right? Number one, it's a reminder for myself when I'm either hiring or looking for the person is to keep my bar super high and just not settle because if I do, most likely in 6 months, it would not be true that I that I would be able to let this person run and I would still be telling them what to do, which is not what I want. That is not my desire. The second sort of effect of that is that it's I say that to people, you know, when they come on the team or as we're making the fire hire because, you know, it communicates to them that that's my bar and that's how they know they'll be successful, right? And something to kind of work towards, right? And the third thing is kind of a joint thing for the both of us, which is it kind of gives us, it helps me and the person operate on a different level where it's not the goal is not like did you hit this OKR, did you hit this goal, the the meta goal becomes, hey, are we building, you know, are we calibrating enough, are we actually getting to a spot where in six months like you're the one telling me what needs to be done, like, like that, are we, are we getting there, right? Because then if, if that's the framing, every, you know, mistake that you know is made or whatever on either of our our parts is becomes a learning opportunity in terms of like, well, how do we grow to to from this to where we want to be in six months, right? And how is it possible that you know, I as a as a manager can do the right things to set this person up for success so that I don't have to be involved in six months, right? And I think that those, those three things like and and and being able to have that second order effect of this simple razor in 6 months, I'm telling what to do, I've hired the wrong person, it puts pressure on me, it puts pressure on the person and it creates this really interesting environment and and this kind of safe space to really think about are we heading towards that goal and again, every place I've been at, as much as I've loved building the product, I've taken so much pride in building the team and it's just been so much of a pleasure and I think this is my one of the two secrets that I have here. This is so good. I want to, I have a follow-up question, but just to point out why I think this is so genius. Is it there's kind of a assumption here of this person, uh, you can trust them? So there's like a, do I trust this person? Do I feel like they're going to be proactive? Do I feel like they're going to have uh, correct insights? Essentially, taste and gut feeling. Uh, it's like the layer below this question, which is great. And also just this like autonomy. It feels like you, autonomy almost implies so many important traits of somebody that you want to hire. And I love just how simple this question is for both you and them.\n\nThank you. And and really without autonomy, I love what you said about autonomy because truly if without as as a leader, as a manager, your goal is to scale. And if you don't have, if this thing, this simple statement is not true, how are you able to build the best company, the best product? So here's the followup question. Is this mostly for leaders, like say head of product at ChatGPT? Say someone's not a CPO, they're just like, I don't know, a manager of a PM team. Do you find is there a version of this that you think might be useful to them or is this mostly for leaders?\n\nI think this is for everyone. I think it's for everyone who is a manager, right? Because you know, if you're going to be a successful manager at any company um or a leader at any company and if you're if you're kind of starting as a line manager or whatnot and you're kind of you know, wanting to grow or even just wanting to, you know, if you're early at a company, you have so much institutional knowledge and so getting more uh sort of leverage in terms of being able to pass on the wisdom that you've learned is so crucial uh into being successful. That I think every manager should should approach their, you know, their their reports with this because truly like that's it's just good for everyone. It's good for the company to have more kind of leverage and and scale. It's good for uh the the person who's being brought onto the team because they know what success looks like and it gives them a path to kind of keep on growing. And it's great for you as a leader, as a manager to be able to basically scale up the entire uh uh sort of expertise of your team. And I imagine you don't even need to plan to not tell them what to do. Like it's just a good lens into are they going to be amazing even if you plan to be telling them sort of what to do. Yeah. Exactly. And the other thing is like again in your interview process, you kind of end up looking for these insights, right? And you look for like the behaviors of like, oh, are they actually going to be potentially able to to achieve this in six months and that's going to give you a really good lens on the picking side, not just the development side as well.\n\nPeter, what's your second secret? This is uh one for one. Yeah. Okay. The second one I'd say is I I feel really strongly about this, which is um, you know, the area that I look for most is growth mindset. Um, and I actually came to this um, you know, some point in my managing career at Facebook where I real, you know, I did make a mistake and hired someone who just didn't quite have that growth mindset and it was really difficult because you know, the way I say is like I don't have time to sugar coat any feedback, right? And frankly like the best people I've worked with are the people who come into one ones with me and yell at me and telling them I'm I'm messing up. Like that's I love that cuz that's there's no nothing left unsaid and we're able to kind of move the ball forward of like hey like how do we get better from this and I feel like growth mindset's one of those things Lenny that feels really hard to teach at a certain age and this is really important to me and my family I expect growth mindset of myself of my kids, you know, my my colleagues at work because I think it just like creates this environment where everyone is open to like what's\n\n\nthe one thing I can get better at.\nAnd you know that whole get 1% better every day can become true.\nAnd it's it's funny because like I, whenever I go to teams like TGBT or Uber, when I'm always the final interview for someone in my org and I partner with recruiting on developing that uh the rubric, I always insist on doing the last interview and I do not product sense.\nI don't do design.\nI don't do execution.\nI don't do metrics.\nI only do growth mindset.\nAnd it's kind of like, well that's crazy.\nLike what about all of these other attributes?\nI'm like, well, I'm pretty sure I can trust the other people to assess the other attributes.\nBut I think the growth mindset thing is so important to me that that we build an org where people are self-reflective and want to get better and take that feedback and give that feedback and it just is this meta unlock that I found to be true.\nAnd really if you don't have growth mindset then and you're not open to feedback, you're not open to learning, then that's like the the the meta blocker, right?\nAt that point, you know, it's hard to give feedback.\nIt's hard to, you know, onboard to a new skill.\nIt's hard to kind of uh develop in any sort of meaningful way.\nAnd so I found that to be like the the really critical piece.\nThat's a big deal what you just said there that essentially as the CPO, head of product, big product leader at a company.\nYour interview is not like are you an amazing product manager?\nAre you do you have products ta taste?\nUh things like that.\nIt's growth mindset and and I just want to clarify it's because everyone that has been you know all the other things have been interviewed by the designer by the engineering lead etc.\nAnd that's where that, you know, kind of the previous principle comes into play as well in terms of I I do trust my team to go and assess those people, right?\nBut the one thing that I care so much about is growth mindset.\nAnd that's kind of the the thing.\nAnd and to be honest, I do do a little bit of a sweep.\nSo if some we got weak signal on one of those areas, I'll do it.\nBut the the pure sort of uh focus of my last interview is going to be on growth mindset.\nOkay.\nWell, I need to ask you what that looks like.\nBut before I do, uh, when you talk about growth mindset, I have this, uh, image of Mark Beni off on the podcast.\nAnd I asked them just like there's so much changing all the time.\nIt's such a crazy world to be leading a company in this world where just everyone's disrupting each other.\nAI's changing everything.\nIt's just like moving so fast.\nEvery day there's a new, you know, breakthrough and you have to keep track and just like, how do you deal with that?\nAnd he's like, you should be thinking, good, this is amazing.\nThis is the best time to be building.\nThere's so much opportunity.\nSo exciting.\nThis is what we want.\nExactly.\nGood.\nI just remember seeing like good.\nI love that.\nI feel like that's the epitome of growth mindset.\nYeah.\nAbsolutely.\nOkay.\nSo, let me ask you just what do you how do you tease out a strong growth mindset?\nWhat are some ways?\nWell, good thing I'm not an operator anymore because I'm going to give away my interview questions.\nSo, no one can like cheat on this.\nSo, I feel like this another reason why this is such a great time to do this podcast.\nUh the question I asked is it's been the same one I've asked for years and you can really you know kind of sus it out from this which is I I asked them think about the one of the biggest mistakes you've made like truly the most the more painful the better and tell me what the mistake was describe to me the situation and tell me actually how you actually think differently now work differently as a result like how has that turned into a corporate principle of yours, etc.\nAnd I give them a moment to think about it.\nSometimes I even share some of my mistakes if need be.\nAnd uh it's interesting because because I've asked this question so many times, I can smell the BS if they're not being authentic, right?\nIt's like, you know, kind of like, oh, I've worked too hard or I, you know, did this thing and they're really not being that.\nYou can tell the vulnerability that people are willing to express and I reciprocate with that because if they ask me what mine is, I will tell them what it is, right?\nAnd then that's the vibe.\nAnd then what ends up happening is like there's multiple reasons why this is really interesting.\nOne, you get to get a sense of how reflective they are.\nAnd there were some there's one woman I I I um was was chatting with and we actually went on for like an hour because she was just like educating me on this like amazing problem that she had made this mistake on and like how it changed the way that she worked and the company worked.\nIt was just incredible, right?\nAnd you can you can sense the passion.\nYou can sense what's genuine, right?\nAnd then there always once in a while those those those things where people are like just very a little bit more defensive and not willing to open up.\nUm, and I think that's uh and it's safe.\nIt's a it's a one-on-one setting, so it's a safe space.\nAnd I'm, you know, it's also it's I don't think it actually selects for or against introverts or extroverts.\nI think at that point it's really genuine.\nAnd the second sort of order effect there is if they end up coming on the team, you've already had that moment.\nYou've already had that moment where you've just already said like, &quot;Hey, like this is where I really messed up.&quot;\nAnd guess what?\nIt's all okay.\nIt's not a loss.\nIt's a lesson, right?\nAnd so it just sets a different tone for your working relationship.\nSo again, I've never AB tested this, so I can't tell you if this is actually you it works or not, but I found it to be very helpful in the style that I work in to be able to have that level of connection whether it's with a direct report or somebody in the or what I love about this answer is it's very much like fail Corner, which is a recurring segment on this podcast and I might tweak Fail Corner to be even closer to this question.\nOkay.\nSo, let me summarize these two.\nEssentially, two questions that you've found to be really helpful in finding these superstars that you've hired over the years.\nOne is you ask people in six months if I'm telling you what to do, I've hired the wrong person or I guess how do you say it when you say it to someone just like you're probably the right wrong person?\nUh, well, it's it's actually framed a little bit differently.\nIt's in so there's there's five different sort of part of my API or just how to work best with me.\nThere's like five attributes of people that um uh that are most successful who who who work with me and I love working with and and one of them is framed as sort of like you know that that you know there you're telling me what to do not the other way around six months after joining.\nRight.\nRight.\nAnd then I I follow up with in six months if I'm still telling what to do I've hired the wrong person.\nRight.\nAnd think that is that's that's how I frame it.\nOkay.\nUh by the way you should open source this uh p PXD API doc.\nI would love to.\nI think now I got nothing to hide.\nI'm just like here I'm an open book.\nSo maybe we'll do that at some point.\nYou'll you'll you'll make me brave enough to do that maybe after this podcast.\nSo you may find a link in the show notes for this podcast to that doc if I'm brave enough.\nOkay.\nAnd then the the other question you ask is tell me essentially a a story of when you failed a product that you launched failed and how that changed how you behave, how you think about product, how you operate.\nYeah.\nAmazing.\nOkay.\nGreat.\nOkay.\nLet's talk about management.\nSure.\nSo, this came up.\nSo, I talked to a bunch of people that have worked with you and interestingly, one of the most recurring themes.\nIt wasn't about like AI or uh hiring came up a bit, but it's actually mo mostly about how skilled you are as a manager.\nAnd this has already come through in a lot of the things we've talked about.\nSo, I want to talk about a couple things here.\nSure.\nOne is uh someone that you worked with at at OpenAI, Joanna Jen, or is it Joanne?\nJoanne.\nJoanne.\nJoanne Jen or Yang?\nYeah, Jen.\nJen.\nOkay, cool.\nYou worked with her at OpenAI and she shared a couple things that I think are really interesting.\nOne is that you had a profound impact on her career by teaching her how to manage up more effectively.\nAnd you did that by teaching her a really simple phrase that she just says and uses.\nFirst of all, do you remember what that phrase is?\nI've said a lot of stuff and I've kind of forgotten.\nI tend to forget what I say.\nSo, you might have to remind me.\nOkay.\nSo she said say you'll do the thing do the thing say you did the thing.\nMhm.\nAs a skill of managing up.\nSo sure just talk about that just the power of that and what that's all about.\nI mean look I I I I learned this from uh my time at Uber from Jill who runs uh PR comms and policy there and she used to have the saying which is like repetition doesn't spoil the prayer.\nIt's just a a natural thing where people are busy.\nSo whether you know if you think about managing up or even managing you know the entire org if you don't repeat what your goals are if you don't repeat what your vision is if you don't repeat the thing that you feel strongly about that what you're doing what you're you know you whether it's maybe it's your manager one I think you might lose sight of the thing that's important and I think this is where it's a little bit of a behavior this is another language affecting thought thing right by uh by by by giving this this phrase to Joanne, maybe it was just like, hey, let's just be very intentional about what we build.\nThat's like that becomes a a constant reminder, right?\nAnd uh and it's also has this other effect where uh if you're saying this is what I'm doing, and then that's a thing that your manager is like, wait, we don't need to do that anymore.\nYou can have a conversation about that as opposed to just like doing the thing and not saying that you're doing it.\nSo, let me take a step back.\nSo one say what you're going to do and then in that in that exercise you're going to be able to calibrate with your manager again with anyone right what is it that we're going to do and it's I think the words are really important here going back to what I said earlier so figuring out what is that goal and crafting that to really pack the most punch and the densest of uh of of uh concepts right and then you're telling them that you're doing it which that's the second phase which is like well in your 101 ones or in your in your your your team all hands, you're saying this is what we're doing, right?\nIt's a great time to reaffirm what you're doing or invite the conversation that this is no longer the thing to do and you got to tell them that you did it.\nSo, just close the loop.\nJust be like, &quot;Okay, great.\nThis is now done.&quot;\nUm, and I think that's again, it's one of those like really piffy phrases that has so many secondord effects that are behavioral almost.\nAnd this is a little bit of a hack in terms of helping people.\nYou know, it's funny that Joanne thought of it as managing up, which is which it is, but in my mind, it's almost like this is how we operate and this is how we're successful to stay on stay on task, stay on goal, and be able to revisit the goals that we've set when they no longer are relevant.\nOkay, so the phrase again is say you'll do the thing, do the thing, and then say that you did the thing.\nIt's actually Sorry, one more time.\nIt's it's it's say it's the way I would say it is say you're going to do the thing, say that you're doing the thing, and then say that you did it.\nThis reminds me of uh this also works for presentation advice.\nSo, this came up.\nI I don't know if it was Guy Kawasaki or someone had a very similar phrase that was for how to present well, which is tell them what you're going to tell them.\nTell them and then tell them what you just told them.\nThat, you know, it's possible that I might have, you know, incepted it from there.\nSo, I take no ownership over this phrase.\nI will just say that yes, I did I did repeat it.\nThis is great.\nAnd I love that this isn't just managing up advice.\nIt's just like operating advice for everyone.\nAnd there's an implication of uh the last part is just like take like make sure people know what you did.\nLike almost like make sure you get some credit and people understand the impact you've had, which is which is important.\nI think there's a lot of people who are kind of introverted and don't want to draw attention and don't have the hero complex.\nAnd I think that those people tend to get lost in in organizations.\nSo if that describes you, just remember to to say what you did.\nThere's another management trait that Joanne shared that I want to spend a little time on, which is you're very good at helping people understand that they can lean into their strengths and not feel like they need to fit into a certain box.\nShe shared that you basically helped her create almost a new role within OpenAI that wasn't even a thing before.\nSo just maybe share that example and then just talk about why this is important, how you think about this.\nWell, I I love that we're talking about things that Joan are telling you because Joanne's really special.\nI I got to just take a moment to give her a giant shout out.\nShe is uh the only person that I've worked with that has as much technical depth as she does have product taste.\nAnd I just want to pause there like it's it's just truly special.\nI I feel entirely privileged to have the chance to cross paths with her at opening eye.\nI learned so much from her.\nLike again, t talk about like not telling you what to do after 6 months.\nLike she was telling me what to do from like day two and I loved it because she was she's so technical and she has this taste and that those two things are very rare to find together.\nAnd with Joanne because\n\n\nShe was so special in that way, and I spotted that. I was like, \"Wow, like, I've worked with so many PMs, and it's just like, this is very unique.\" It just felt like we had to find a way to craft this, right? And sure enough, she was... I was like, \"Hey, can you just write up a job description of like, what is this thing?\" Because there's something magical here, but I don't fully understand it. I don't think any other person really thinks of things this way, and I think this might be a big superpower for OpenAI. Like, let's codify it, right? And again, going back to my language being a really important thing, I think the exercise sometimes of writing things down, of like things that you intuitively feel, give you an artifact that can kind of communicate with somebody else. So, like, in this case, Joanne writing down some of the things that she got really excited about helped me really understand that. And, you know, I was luckily in a position where I can basically say, \"Let's create this role. Let's create this role and have you lead it, and I think this is going to be great for the product if we're able to codify it.\" So I don't think I did anything special. I was just following my instincts and just like following her lead. Again, I will be clear. I did not author that document. My recollection is she did that. So she did all the hard work and all of this thing, and I don't want to take any credit for it. The only thing I did was just gave her a little nudge of, \"I think there's something here. Like, can you just take a moment to go and write this down?\" And when she did, it was just like, \"Okay, this has got to be a role, and you have to be the leader for this function.\" What is the actual role she ended up in? I think that'd be really interesting to share. Yeah, the role was model designer. Um, and it was just a really interesting way that she framed it. And I know this role probably exists in some incarnation in other foundational model companies, but the way that she described it and the things that she found to be the spikes required led us to hire our first two model designers after running a search, and they were just perfect fits for the team, right? Um, and that, I think, is largely a big secret as to why I'm biased. I love ChatGPT so much in the way the model design comes off. Um, and the vibe of the model is largely because of this like technical plus taste role that she has created and she is leading. I love... One of the interesting takeaways from this is, as a leader, is just pay attention to what people are really, really excited about and then take the step of let them try to describe it very clearly in a dock, coming back to your point about the power of language and words. It's just like, \"Okay, tell me exactly what you're thinking, and let's jam on it because maybe there's something here.\" Yeah. Is there anything broader here about just like leaning into strength that you find? Just like, you know, there's a lot of people, there's all this debate of like, \"Should I just work on the things I'm terrible at, and that'll make me better, or should I find the things I'm amazing at and just get better at those things?\" Any thoughts there? I genuinely believe that fit is a two-way street. And so what you are passionate about, what your strengths are, you got to really find the right company, the right role for you. And I think there's a lot of force-fitting that people want to do is to fit into a certain archetype. I'm glad we talked about the PM archetypes. Hopefully that frees people up to kind of really lean into what they love, right? Because, you know, life's pretty short. It would be great if everyone would find the thing that they really wanted to do and be able to lean in and do that. And I think the optimist in me is also why this is... I'm so excited about the time and age that we're in right now because there's so many different companies popping up. So there's like, there's something that really resonates with people, right? I mean, take a look at just the... you know, we're doing here. It's like podcasting was not a thing 20 years ago. Like, we... there was... it was not a thing. But now we're able to like have these amazing tools and platforms that allow people to really express themselves and really what really truly brings them joy and makes them happy, uh, and also brings a ton of value, uh, to the world, right? So I think that, yeah, I definitely believe in leaning in strengths, and I think that, you know, as hard as it may be sometimes, you got to look at sort of where you are right now, and is this the thing that you really want to do, or is there something else that's kind of like kind of, uh, drawing your attention and drawing you towards that? There's another management-oriented question I want to ask you. This came from Eric Antel, who, uh, apparently has worked with you for 17 years across a bunch of off and on for 17 years. One of my biggest, uh, mentors and friends, like, he's amazing. Okay, so he... he... he's like, \"You need to ask this question.\" So the way he put it is, \"You've hired, managed, mentored many, many, many product people, some junior, some senior, across so many different cultures.\" And he's just like, \"We need to learn something from your experience doing that, uh, in terms of what you've learned about what it takes to be a really successful product person, whether it's being successful in building product or career-wise. What's just like a nugget that you learn from seeing so many different types of people and cultures and seniority?\" I think for a product person specifically, it's really important to obsess over the details of craft because you're ultimately, you're crafting a product. It's important to obsess about the details of craft while simultaneously having the perspective and wisdom of which details don't actually matter. I'm going to pause there and just kind of try to unpack this a little bit because at the core of being a product person, you're like, \"Oh, like I want to build something that people love, right?\" And that's the job, and that's that's what draws people to be product people is that you have this desire to build. And I think that I've been involved in enough teams where I myself, and when I was really young and coming up as a product person, I would just get obsessed over these little, little details, and I've I realized afterwards that we just wasted a bunch of time on something that didn't actually matter. So I think that dichotomy is somewhat interesting and beautiful to me because it encapsulates both the core of what the ethos of a successful product person is, which is you really have to care, and you have to to give a crap about the product that you're building. But you also have to have the perspective and business know-how to understand where do you apply your time and where do you apply the care there. And I myself feel like I've gone through cycles, you know, like everything that I've done, I've gone super deep and really obsessed, and then I take a step back and I'm like, \"Wait, actually, I was missing something, and this other thing was more important,\" right? I'll give you an example. I'll use the Uber example here as... as, um, as you know, what I said that, you know, that the digital product didn't really matter, right? And it was all about the price, the ETA. One of the proudest products I've built at Uber, which is Uber Reserve, right? It's the simplest of thing. Going back to what I said before, sometimes the best products are the simplest of things. But the problem that we were trying to solve is that, you know, everyone has this. You have a 6 a.m. flight, and are you really going to wake up at 4:00 a.m. and request an Uber and hope that there's enough Ubers and the person is going to come, right? Because if you do that, you're not going to sleep well, and you're going to like, you know, wake up every two hours, and you're you're probably going to miss your flight anyway because you're going to fall asleep or whatever. And so there was this insight of like, \"Okay, there's a whole mismatch between what people really want, which is the peace of mind that their car is going to be there,\" and guess what? I'm willing to pay for that, right? And so we built Uber Reserve, which was like, it was the simplest thing, which is like, \"Oh, just like go ahead and say what time your flight is, and we'll work backwards,\" or even just like, \"Tell us when you want to get picked up.\" And everything about that product, we crafted what really mattered for the user, which was the peace of mind. So if you go there and you say what time your flight is, and you you pick up your your pickup time or whatever, I think that the product is... it hasn't changed that much since I was there. It would tell you, \"Oh, this is cutting it really close. You may not make your flight.\" It's like, \"Wow.\" Again, that was put in there because of the principle of peace of mind, right? And and on the other side, it's like, \"Well, what do drivers need? They need to... they need to know you're not going to cancel,\" and all this other stuff. So, you got to think about the driver incentives, too. So, it was a simple idea. Uh, really proud of the team for figuring out all the intricate details. Did some testing. And last I heard from folks internally, this is like a $5 billion a year business now and one of the highest margin ones. And I'm really proud of this because it's like it came from the idea of like, \"Let's focus on what actually matters,\" right? Which is this, that peace of mind, and how many people really need it in that moment. So, so that, I think, that's a story that... the best... the best story I can tell. That's an awesome story. Uh, it connects so many of the things you've talked about. One is just, uh, it may not be the product that really matters, and micro-optimizing the experience is not going to move the needle when there's something else that's more operationally oriented. But, you know, there's always going to be a product component if you're building it for users. The other piece that I think is interesting here is it's, uh, well, there's two. One is just it connects back to your point about the importance of autonomy of product people is just like, \"I feel like you're like, 'Here's the team, here's what I'm told to work on,' and then you're like, 'Oh, but this thing is actually the problem we need to solve,' and let's just build a new product around it,\" and then there's a whole story imagine of you getting buying and all that stuff. The other thing this connects to, we just had the CPO of Uber, the current CPO of Uber, on the podcast, and he talked... that'll be out a few episodes before this one, and he's... it was all about dogfooding and basically exactly discovering these problems. He... he's done 7 to 800 rides as an Uber driver to do to discover these problems. He had this great quote about, uh, it's like one thing to watch to build an app for drivers sitting in your office making it look really pretty. It's another to be driving 60 miles an hour with this phone a few feet away from you trying to figure things out. 100%. Oh, I remember that. I... I took um, two weeks off before I joined Uber, and in that time, I've... I've been obsessed with kind of like user research for the the longest of times, and this is like more relevant back then when you wanted to really understand how, you know, you... the wide, uh, mass of, uh, users were using your product. Um, and I remember I actually leased a car to to drive for Uber those two weeks. Um, so it was a little white, uh, uh, VW something or another. I put an Uber sticker on it. I turned on the app, and I just started driving. It's like, there's no better way to learn than to dogfood. And I'll just build on what what Sachin... Sachin, right? This is the person you had on on the podcast. Yeah. It's amazing, amazing guy. And and so I'll just build on sort of what he said there. I think that, you know, what really stuck with me in terms of framework that I learned back in school was, cuz I was brought up at with the IDEO way of design thinking. Um, and I was at the design school at Stanford where before, you know, we literally were in, uh, trailers. Uh, that's... that's... that's how early it was. But I remember the the framework that really stuck with me is what IDEO preached, which is like there are five stages to great design thinking. Number one is empathize. Two is to define. Three is to ideate. Four is to prototype. And and five is to test. And what I love about this framework, and I really hope this doesn't get lost because I... I don't know how much it's being preached nowadays in in design thinking, is that it really... it has the right words associated with it. You know, like the first thing is empathizing. Like, it's not just about you got to really feel the pain of your customers, right? It's not just about kind of theoretically understanding what the problems are. It's like really empathizing, which is why, you know, user research was so important to me, right? Is to understand that, or even, you know, like Sachin said, just taking those rides, but also, you know, flying around the world and and when I was working at Uber to figure out, well, what are the various conditions... and so empathize is like a really powerful word. The define is also a really powerful word because it forces you to articulate what the problem is. And this is again going back to the language thing of you have to be very intentional about defining the um, the the problems that you want to solve. And then ideate, we all know it's brainstorming, and prototyping and tests are self-explanatory. But the first two stages, I think, are really insightful, um, and it talks directly to what Sachin was saying. It's like you got a dogfood because you really have to empathize, and the great products are when you really feel the pain and you really empath... empathize with the with with what people are are experiencing. This is a great connection to another podcast episode that I... I came to mind as you were talking, uh, the head of product at Linear, Naan, had this really great concept that's exactly what you're just saying, which is as a product person, you want to feel the pain of your customer the same way they do. You shouldn't stop asking questions to understand what they're telling you until you feel the pain that they feel, and that'll help you empath... that basically that's like how to operationalize empathizing. It's just do you feel the suffering. Yeah. And I really do hope um, product people still do this to this day because I think there\n\n\nThere's so many shortcuts that if people take, you're going to miss the point, right?\nI still remember distinctly flying down to LA with Kevin Weil to go do a user research study.\nUh, and it was a one-way glass thing where we listened to people talk about Instagram and how they use Instagram, and it was there's no substitute for that, right?\nI think that if to anyone out there who's like doing user interviews and then saying, \"Hey, ChatGPT, summarize the takeaways,\" you're missing the point.\nYou can't empathize with the summary.\nYou have to be in the room fully immersed, no phones, just actually hearing the words and the intonation.\nThat's how you're going to get the full color.\nSo, yeah, it makes me think of Jeff Bezos has this great quote.\nIf you're trying to, if you have an anecdote and data and they're telling you different things, trust the anecdote.\nOh, man.\nSo many lessons.\nOkay, so to start to kind of wrap up our conversation, we covered a lot of ground.\nI want to ask you about Facebook real quick.\nSo you joined Facebook very early.\nUh, Eric Antinau, who I've mentioned previously, told me that it was very strange that you left Google to join Facebook at that stage.\nGoogle was killing it on top of the world.\nYou had such a strong career path.\nThings were going great, but you decided to take a big leap joining Facebook.\nWhat made, what did you see?\nBecause I think there's something interesting here that we can learn about what you saw that helps that may help other people decide where to go work.\nI've always been enamored with this idea of understanding us as fundamentally human and how we're wired.\nAnd I remember at the time, you know, talking to the folks at Facebook and seeing it, and this is back when like people like, \"Oh, this is just a college site, you know, and and that's that was the the vibe back then.\"\nBut what I saw was that the team and Mark and and others really understood the fundamental human sort of desires that people had to connect and feel lonely and to to share, and they really got the right articulation of the problem they were trying to solve, which was to to to make the world more open and connected.\nAnd this really resonated with me because I again, I studied a lot in college like psychology, and just I was really enamored with this idea of like, how are we as humans fundamentally wired, and it felt to me like a a no-brainer to go work at Facebook because they saw how people were wired and how to actually build products that complement how people are wired, right?\nAnd it wasn't that they were trying to force fit something into something that was unnatural.\nIt was almost like, you know, how do we build technologies and and products that actually um augment our our fundamental desire to kind of stay connected?\nAnd this goes back to sort of why I think the power of wars is so important is because, you know, you take a look at some of the mission statements for like Fster or or MySpace.\nI don't even know if they had mission statements or what they were.\nThey were kind of vapid, and they didn't really speak to the fundamental humanity of what Facebook was striving to build, and that just deeply resonated with me, right?\nAnd so it's I remember spending time with Eric being like, \"Hey, what should I do?\nShould I take this offer from Facebook or should I stay at Google?\"\nBut ultimately it was just like that deep resonance with my values of building things that were fundamentally human.\nAnd ultimately, I think that for any startup out there, anyone building product, the more that you can get a good impedance match between what you're building and what humans fundamentally want and need, the more successful you're going to be, right?\nUm, so that's that's like my my my big answer.\nI think the the second and secondary answer, um, I've always optimized for learning like in my career, and this is a huge thing that I say to a lot of people because they look at sort of like, oh, you've been at all these companies, like what's your secret?\nLike, well, I've just figured out that I want to go to the place where I can learn the most.\nAnd for me, that wasn't really Google, but I had so much I wanted to learn from operating at Facebook.\nUm, and at Facebook, I would say, yeah, I was there for nine and a half years, but I always jumped around every two and a half or so when I feel like there was something new to learn.\nAnd that's it.\nThat's, I mean, I don't know if it's a secret or not.\nIt just, it just, I got lucky and I just was able to have opportunities to learn different things and different skills.\nUm, and that served me quite well, and regardless of any outcome, I would say that's just a great way to live your life.\nUm, personally is just to kind of optimize for learning and those experiences, and and for me, you know, moving to Facebook was that I saw so much learning that that that could have happened, and it ultimately did happen.\nSo I feel like that it was a good outcome too.\nBoy, did it.\nSo, a couple takeaways here for folks that are maybe trying to decide between a couple roles, maybe deciding if they should leave and do something new.\nIs uh, one, are you feeling like you're learning enough, slash is the new place you're thinking about going to help you learn a lot more?\nTwo is this uh, is what they're building aligned with human behavior, almost this impotent impetence match that you described?\nFeels like there's another element you uh, shared, which is do they have a really unique insight about how things work, and also do you really care about this?\nIs this also how you see the world?\nSo you're talking about a Facebook, like they had this really unique insight about human behavior, and that was really important to you, and so it's a really good fit.\n100% yeah, I think the insight thing, thank you for summarizing that and drawing that out because that is um, that's also what I look for and when I, you know, want to partner with companies and startups now is like, do you have that unique insight?\nAre you teaching me something that I, I really don't know?\nUm, and that usually is a good indicator of a strong point of view.\nUm, and uh, having a strong point of view is really important because like, you know, there's a saying that Mike and Kevin had at Instagram, which is um, uh, we may not be right, but at least we're not confused.\nI think that just, it was, it's a beautiful phrase, I thought, because like, you know, sometimes you just got to go and do the thing that you think is right.\nUm, and the indecision is going to be one of the things that really kind of gets you and bites you, right?\nSo that, that, that for me is is something is I look for folks who have a strong conviction, uh, whether it's the the founders I support, uh, you know, when I go join and and be an operator at the company or the founders I support in my current role.\nThat's so interesting.\nTor Cohen, the CPO of LinkedIn, uses that's that's a famous phrase that he often uses, too.\nSo, I wonder if you borrowed it from those guys.\nYeah, that was that was one of his mottos.\nUh, we may not be right, but we're not confused.\nWow.\nI didn't know that.\nSo, I, I did talk to him at one point.\nI don't remember if that's something we talked about, but again, it could just be like, you know, great minds think alike, and we just had different uh, different great folks from Mike and Kevin and and Tor feeling feeling the same vibes.\nI love just how many episodes this conversation has referenced.\nOkay, so speaking of learning, final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round.\nI'm going to take us to fail corner, right?\nWhich very aligned with uh, your growth mindset question.\nSo the idea of this segment is people come on this podcast, they share all these amazing stories of everything's working out.\nI had so much success, worked at all these incredible companies, everything worked.\nBut in reality, things don't often work out.\nMost people go through a lot of failed uh, initiatives, projects, career uh, hits.\nSo the question is just what's a product that you built and launched that was just a big failure?\nAnd I'll ask it the way you ask it.\nWhat's, how did that change the way you think and operate?\nYou know, one, one example is, you know, since we're talking about Instagram before, um, you know, we tried to build a kind of camera-first app at Instagram.\nIt was called Bolt, and it didn't work.\nAnd the great, you know, kind of levels of craft and design and and the premise was essentially like, you know, can we make it so it's just reduces the pressure to share, right?\nAnd you can open to a camera, you can, you can just kind of like send some things to folks and you get some good feedback and you kind of uh, go from there.\nAnd uh, it was, and obviously the Instagram design team, so it was top-notch, like the app was designed really well.\nIt was really fast because it was Instagram, you know, engineering team, and they were just really good at making performant mobile apps, right?\nIt had all of the advantages that we had talked about uh, that we valued at Instagram, but we launched it, and I believe it was New Zealand or Australia, and it didn't work.\nUm, and I remember the the reason we, we, we knew this is we're looking at sort of the the retention graphs, and retention is the key indicator in any product that you build.\nUh, it's not the number of users, it's not the volume, it's actually retention and cohorted retention.\nYou can, you can draw the, you plot the line, and and if it asmmptotes, then you're in a good spot, um, because that means that people over uh, x period of time will continue to stay on the app, and that just didn't happen.\nAnd I think the learning here was that you can really have the best team in the world with the best product taste.\nUm, and you can't really predict what's going to hit on the first go.\nAnd failure is okay.\nYou're just going to up and learn from that, right?\nAnd nobody wallowed over that.\nWe actually had some technology that we built there that we were able to port over to the main app, which was really, really helpful.\nBut, you know, to quote the great American poet Sean Carter, it ain't a loss, it's a lesson, right?\nAnd I think it's really important that you see that as a product person is that you don't, you don't see it as failure.\nYou see it as like, kind of great, now I, now I'm that much smarter, right?\nUm, and this is something that I've just collected.\nThere's other examples as well.\nUm, but I think this is one of a good example of sort of uh, something that's somewhat counterintuitive that you have the best team.\nYou're going to provide those hits over and over, but sometimes you, you can't predict those hits.\nAnd you just have to have the wisdom to be like, \"Okay, let's, let's, let's uh, see what we can learn here, see what we can save here, and then move on.\"\nI absolutely remember that product and launch or heard about it.\nAnd uh, but I also don't ever think about it.\nAnd so I think it's a good reminder because that's a, you know, Instagram launching a new product that's trying to rethink the way you do social, your camera.\nThat's a big deal.\nAnd so I could see that being a really big deal for it not to work out.\nAt the same time, nobody remembers that really.\nExactly.\nYeah.\nPeter, we've, we've gone for two hours at this point.\nI feel like we could do it two hours more.\nUh, we'll save that for another conversation.\nGreat.\nBefore we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you either wanted to share or want to leave listeners with to maybe double down on a point you made that you think might be helpful?\nOtherwise, we'll just jump right in.\nI think we should jump right in because I, I, I feel like you've uh, you've extracted every little ounce of what wisdom I had here.\nUm, and you did a great job here just helping me uh, remember these stories and uh, recounting stuff.\nSo I'm, I'm ready to jump in.\nThat's my goal.\nUh, although I know there uh, is much more that I haven't even started to tap.\nUh, but with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round.\nAre you ready?\nUh, I'm ready.\nQuestion one.\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\nThis is easy for me.\nUm, number one is Sapiens.\nUm, you, if you're a product person, you have to understand uh, our own humanity if you want to build products for people straight up.\nThat's, that's, that's a beautiful book.\nI read it before it was called Sapiens.\nIt was called uh, from animals to gods, uh, and it was just republished a different name, but it has really stuck with me, and I remember it's a very short, easy read.\nSo, I, I'd recommend that.\nUh, the second book I think for product folks is is a classic one, which is the design of everyday things by Don Norman.\nThis may seem outdated and old, but it's, I promise you, it's not.\nIt really helps you understand, you know, physical product design, which is again, things that mold and shape to humanity.\nI think it gives you a good sense of that.\nThird book is something I'm reading right now.\nIt's recommended by a friend of mine, and I can't put it down.\nIt's called The Silk Roads, um, uh, by Peter Franco, and basically this is a recounting of history through the lens of the Silk Road and and sort and the Middle East and how how that's evolved.\nIt's so fascinating because one of the things I love, Lenny, is seeing things from different perspectives.\nThis is why travel's fun.\nThis is why like, you know, user research is fun for me.\nAnd it really helps you see the events of world history that we've all been experiencing through a very western view uh, viewpoint in a in a different way.\nAnd it kind of connects a bunch of things that are like, you know, there's western thought, there's eastern thought, but if you see the connection between them, it's super fascinating.\nI'm only two chap, three or maybe four chapters in, but definitely something I would recommend off the bat.\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\nI have to go.\nMaybe it's not as recent, but I, the one that always comes back to me is The Wire.\nUh, HBO's The Wire.\nAnd and I just, I guess there's just so many TV shows now that are, I'm still processing, do I want to put it in my all-time great, but the storytelling there and the v, the various different sort of consistent characters, but the fact that there's the beautiful writing of The Wire is something that's unparalleled.\nI'm now curious what's in your all-time great list, but I'm not going to go there.\nWe\n\n\nWe're going to keep going.\nUh, what's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\nUm, I, I, I'm just going to go with Granola because I think that we talked about this before, but this has been a superpower for me, and I have a lot of commute time now.\nWhat I do is I just do a single player mode.\nI go up and I start thinking about and brainstorming about sort of ideas or thesis I have for investing or whatnot, and I get to where I'm going, and boom, it's there, organized in a more cogent way, and oftentimes ways that I didn't even think about articulating them.\nSo, it goes through the process of forming words, but it also helps that assistance, and I think it's a beautiful product, um, on many different levels.\nWow, Granola's killing it at this category recently.\nAnd I'll give a shout out.\nYou get a year free of Granola if you become a yearly subscriber of my newsletter, which is the not just for you, but your entire team.\nThey're just, they gave an incredible deal.\nIs that true?\nI didn't know that.\n100% true.\nOkay.\nWell, I tell you, I was not compensated for that little pitch there.\nThat was that's that's genuine right there.\nI'm also not compensated.\nYeah, if you go to lenniesnewsletter.com and click bundle, you'll see a way to get it.\nUh, love the product, use it all the time.\nI should be using it for these interviews, and then I could have a whole summary ready to go.\nUh, okay.\nNext question.\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to in work or in life?\nYes.\nThis actually something that my dad taught me.\nUh, it's it's a saying that is in Chinese that it actually rhymes in Chinese, but you know, kind of almost rhymes in in English.\nAnd it's uh, it goes something like this in English, which is if you move a tree, it dies.\nBut if you move a person, he thrives.\nAnd I think it's a really interesting thing I keep on coming back to.\nAnd this goes back to why, you know, for me, it's just the the joy of learning and trying new experiences and trying, you know, being at different companies that I've been very fortunate to be at.\nI really think that that's how you should live life is just to kind of experience these different experiences.\nAnd it's kind of poetic to be like, yeah, like something as you know, unfortunately for trees, like you can't really move them after a while.\nBut for humans, I think that you move them around and, you know, we get different travel experiences and we get different life experiences when we go to different jobs.\nAnd I think that's that's makes life really worth living.\nThere's a I always think about what I would answer to this question, and there's a few, but one is uh something I always come back to when my wife and I are deciding to do something is choose adventure.\nSimilar sentiment.\nFinal question.\nOkay.\nSo, you've now be you moved from product leader to investor.\nSo, I just want to give you a chance to share, tell people what kind of stuff you're looking for.\nSo, you moved, you're Felicis now investing in startups.\nYep.\nWhat sort of startups are you looking for?\nWho should reach out if they're interested in?\nWell, I, I, I appreciate that uh opportunity.\nLook, for me, um, I just I think it's been very clear, like I just love working with great people.\nUm, and uh, you know, it's it's for me, investing is just the ability to support uh, more amazing founders.\nI've always been drawn to the founder archetype, right?\nLike working closely with Zuck or you know with Travis or Howie, um, Brendan at Oculus, and uh, you know, folks at OpenAI.\nI think there's this amazing sort of visionary person that I just I love supporting in one way or another.\nAnd I've supported them from uh mainly from the inside as a product leader, but uh for me, it's just finding those amazing founders, and in this current role, I get to work with many founders at the same time, right?\nAnd and just two days ago, I was on had meaningful calls, product jams with like three different founders in three different industries, and that kind of keeps my mind super alive, so you know, that's that's kind of why I'm doing what I'm doing now, and and I I I would love to find some more of those those amazing thought partners and people that I can just help out if I can.\nOkay.\nThen, uh, stage and, uh, market, anything there for folks of like, okay, he's a fit, not a fit.\nAbsolutely.\nSo, I would say, um, early stage, uh, seed, seed plus, and A, uh, is where I really get excited.\nI feel like I I'm able to help folks see the next stage.\nI've seen a lot of movies in my life, in my career, so it's like, oh, great.\nI can definitely see this extrapolating out.\nYou don't have to convince me of the future.\nAnd then it's really fun to be able to jam and and and help support if I can and how you scale from the uh the one to 10 and 10 to 100.\nSo that's that's really big.\nUh, and in terms of what I look for, it's the two things I said before.\nIt's like in this day and age, there's so many amazing things going to be built.\nOne is do you have unique data and do you have a data flywheel?\nTwo, uh, do you have a really crafted workflow that you can really get after?\nAnd I guess third, it's it's like do you have that insight of what product things actually matter?\nAnd also which ones don't, and then how do you actually go and expand upon that.\nSo yeah, really excited to meet a bunch more founders, whether it comes from here or somewhere else.\nOkay, so final question then is how do folks reach out if they want to actually talk to you about this and how can listeners be useful to you?\nThank you for the question.\nI am an introvert, so I I'm really kind of silent on a lot of social media.\nI have accounts on on on X and you know, threads, but uh, really I think LinkedIn is the the the network of choice for me.\nIs just like I I really uh, I want to be able to passively kind of consume and learn about what what's what's happening.\nHow you listeners can be helpful.\nI just want to learn like what what what are you all thinking about?\nWhat are some of the insights you're you're seeing?\nOne of the analogies I have about AI in this day and age is that it's this really interesting new element that humanity has discovered.\nAnd what's awesome is that humanity is also very creative.\nAnd so what humanity does with this new element I'm fascinated by, right?\nAnd you can tell the founders who've actually played with this element because they have this innate sense of what this thing can do and can't do.\nAnd I I'm just looking to be inspired by the creativity of of all y'all out there.\nWow, that's such a cool way of thinking about it.\nIt's going to change my perspective on AI a little bit.\nPeter, this was incredible.\nI really appreciate you taking the time to share so much wisdom.\nI know this is the first time you've done anything like this.\nUh, I feel like this is going to help a lot of people in a lot of different ways.\nFeel like we covered everything I wanted to cover.\nSo, just again, thank you for.\nWell, thank you for having me.\nThis has been a real pleasure, and it's hopefully, you know, some folks out there can get some some learnings from this and find it useful.\nBut that's that was my goal is to be able to share some things and hopefully it will be helpful to some uh folks out there.\nSo, thank you.\nThank you for the opportunity.\nThank you, Peter.\nBye,
