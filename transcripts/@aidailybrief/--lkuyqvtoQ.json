  "cleanText": "Welcome back to The AI Daily Brief headlines edition.\nAll the daily AI news you need in around 5 minutes.\nWe kick off today with an unfortunate delay from OpenAI.\nThe company has delayed their first open model in years.\nSam Altman tweeted, \"We're going to take a little more time with our open weights model, i.e. expect it later this summer, but not June.\nOur research team did something unexpected and quite amazing, and we think it will be very worth the wait, but needs a bit longer.\"\nNow, this open model was announced back in April, and it's intended to be a reasoning model alongside the same lines as their O series.\nThe announcement had come in the wake of DeepSeek shocking the world as an open-source reasoner, and Altman publicly acknowledging that OpenAI had been on the wrong side of history when it came to open source.\nFollowing the announcement, we got rumors that the research team was working on a way to hand off more complex queries to OpenAI's closed models.\nThere is certainly a lot of competition in this space right now.\nMistral recently released their first family of reasoning models, expanding their range into that latest architecture.\nAlibaba's Quen team have also released a range of hybrid reasoning models that can modulate their inference according to the complexity of the prompt.\nGiven Altman's tweet, it's likely that OpenAI is cooking up something interesting, but for now, we're all just going to have to wait.\nSpeaking of Mistral, that company has brilliantly navigated the changing geopolitical landscape to its own advantage.\nGrowing tensions with the US have caused European companies to seek out a domestic AI solution and Mistral is putting itself firmly in place as that answer.\nThe company is on pace to hit 100 million in annualized revenue this year as a result.\nFrom the beginning of the AI boom, European officials have stressed the need for strategic autonomy from the US.\nAnd while the restrictive AI act has been more of a barrier than anything else, the intention has always been clear to ensure Europe isn't reliant on foreign technology.\nExtending their mission to deliver European tech to the continent, Mistral has also announced a partnership with Nvidia to build a massive new data center located 20 mi south of Paris.\nThe data center will initially house 18,000 of Nvidia's new Blackwell chips.\nThe goal is to give European customers a way to tap into Mistral's AI products without dependence on the US.\nThe plans are to expand the facility to 100 megawatts over the coming year and a half.\nSpeaking from the Vivitech event in Paris yesterday, Mistral CEO Arthur Mench said that US Vice President JD Vance's speech on US dominance in February had been a wake-up call.\nMench said, \"It tremendously affected our demand because European leaders just don't want to be talked to that way.\"\nAt the same event, Nvidia CEO Jensen Hong said that more than 20 AI factories, his new term for these massive AI data centers, are being planned and built across Europe over the next 2 years.\nHe said that several of them will be gigafactories that house over a 100,000 chips, making them suitable for large model training.\nHang said, \"We will increase the amount of AI computing capacity in Europe by a factor of 10.\"\nShikar writes, \"Mistral compute from France is very much a strategic AI infra offering.\nThey want to pitch themselves as an alternative to US and China based AI infrastructure.\nI love this pitch.\nMore companies outside the US and China should take this approach.\nThis prevents centralization at the enterprise level.\nIn the event of a USChina conflict, sovereign states will need neutral AI infrastructure they can trust.\"\nAnother story that we've been watching closely is that of the talent wars in Silicon Valley.\nNow, this has been top of mind ever since the news of Meta potentially sort of acquiring Scale broke.\nAs part of those reports, we discovered that Mark Zuckerberg is also spending big to build a 50 person team around Scale CEO Alexander Wang, who will be leading a new super intelligence effort at Meta.\nBloomberg sources are now discussing what the new roster looks like.\nThey report that Jack Ray, a principal researcher at Google DeepMind, is expected to come on board, and Johan Shawwix, a machine learning lead at AI voice startup Sesame AI, has also reportedly agreed to a deal.\nZuckerberg has apparently been hosting candidates at his home in Palo Alto and Lake Tahoe as part of a personal recruitment drive.\nBloomberg reiterates that Meta and Zuckerberg are offering compensation packages worth tens of millions of dollars over several years.\nAnd as much as this is nominally about future super intelligence, it's also about meturoring up its immediate term.\nArguing for why these massive compensation packages actually make sense, super annotate co-founder of Vehan Petrasan said there are very few people globally who can do these types of large AI trainings very very efficiently.\nNow Meta is no stranger to spending big, but this is definitely a whole different level.\nMenllo Ventures DD Doss confirmed what he's been hearing on the ground in San Francisco posting, \"It's true.\nThe meta offers for the super intelligence team are actually insane.\nIf you work at the big AI labs, Zuck is personally negotiating 10 million plus per year in cold hard liquid money.\nI've never seen anything like it.\nIf you see your buddy who works in AI suddenly join Meta, congratulate them on the new future Atherton mansion.\nDee also said that while he hadn't heard of any 9 figure deals, which was something that had been reported earlier, he had heard nine figures over four years.\nWhen someone paredited the usual VC line that top talent can do better by building their own startup, Doss replied, \"They probably can't actually.\"\nProfessor Ethan Malik pondered how this gigantic recruiting effort might fundamentally shape the industry, saying, \"Big question in AI is whether new entrance can still hope to reach the state-of-the-art or whether learning curve plus compute needs are high enough that this is impossible.\nXAI did it with massive comput and hiring investment, but otherwise is the list of competitors fixed.\"\nNow, in terms of competition and whether there's anyone that can compete with the big tech lab, some interesting news in enterprise AI.\nEnterprise AI startup Glean has closed a new funding round that values the company at $7.2 billion.\nThe series F round led by Wellington Management was a small one, just $150 million in fresh capital, but a big jump in valuation from their $4.6 billion valuation from back in September.\nGlean is in a really interesting spot.\nThey are offering an all-in-one enterprise end-to-end sort of AI package that includes models, agents, enterprise search, and their pitch has had surprising traction inside enterprises.\nNot only have they surpassed 100 million in ARR in our interactions at super intelligent with companies, the one partner to do it all thing that they offer, especially with their exclusive focus on enterprise AI as opposed to some of the other big labs which obviously have lots of different commitments in lots of different areas has been really resonant.\nAt the same time, those big players are all offering certain comparable features, and we're definitely starting to see more aggressive competitive tactics.\nReports are that Salesforce has recently changed its terms of service for the Slack API.\nThat effectively means that companies like Glean won't be able to index and store Slack data for use with their own search technology.\nGiven how much important context and information exists in Slack, that's a big challenge for a company like Glean.\nNow, a Salesforce spokesperson says, \"This is just all about data security,\" stating, \"As AI raises critical considerations around how customer data is handled, we're committed to delivering AI and data services in a way that's thoughtful and transparent.\"\nGlean themselves acknowledged that the change will harm their users, stating in an email to customers that it would quote, \"hamper your ability to use your data with your chosen enterprise AI platform.\"\nIn some ways, clearly a bit of a nudge to try to get those customers to put pressure on Salesforce to potentially reverse course or think differently about the policy.\nStrange Funds Tarot Tan sums it up pretty admirably, writing, \"Metabi scale.\nOpenAI acquires wind surf and anthropic snubs it.\nSalesforce owns Slack and blocks off Glean and other players.\nEveryone is floating $10 million paychecks to poacher horde top AI talent.\nIt's like settlers of katan in real life.\nControl the ports, block the roads, hoard the future.\"\nPerfectly summed up, but that is going to do it for today's headlines.\nNext up, the main episode.\n",
