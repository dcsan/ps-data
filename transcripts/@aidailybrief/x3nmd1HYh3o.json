  "cleanText": "Welcome back to the AI Daily Brief.\n\nAdvertising. Now, this is a space that I've spent some time. For a long time, more than a decade ago, I was working on a company that helped introduce big advertisers and big brands to new startup platforms that they might want to advertise and market with. Then, of course, I had my stint where I was making a huge volume of major national campaigns and Super Bowl ads and things like that. And so, even though I'm not in the space anymore, I definitely keep a side eye towards AI's particular implications for it. And it's been very clear for some time that there were going to be major implications for advertising and marketing when it came to AI. Now, this is an industry that has jumped headlong into this space. It's one where already creativity is in service of commerce. And so perhaps some of the barriers that have stopped other industries or at least slowed them down when it comes to the adoption of AI haven't so much applied when it comes to advertising and marketing. Instead, the constraint has been more around just what's actually possible. In a recent speech that I did, I was talking about why the speed of AI development is accelerating. And one of the things that we were talking about was the fact that each time models advance, it actively opens up new use cases. In other words, you're not just doing the same thing you did before, but a little bit faster or a little bit better or a little bit cheaper. Although that might be part of it, too. It's that there are things you simply couldn't do before that are now possible. One big version of that recently or one big unlock was when Google dropped Veo. The biggest difference with Veo is that it had builtin sound. Previously, if you wanted to make, for example, a 30-cond ad using generative media, you could do it. You could use Sora or VO or Higsfield or whatever to create a video and then you could use 11 Labs to create audio for it and match it up. All of that was possible. And while it was of course a heck of a lot faster than an entire shoot and filming session, it was still a fairly complicated and complex endeavor. Then Google drops Veo and all of a sudden you can just build your sound and the action of the video right into the prompting. It took less than a month for that new capability to turn into an actual ad airing on major network TV. Earlier this week, AI filmmaker PJ Ace tweeted, \"Cali hired me to make the most unhinged NBA Finals commercial possible. Network TV actually approved this GTA style madness. High dopamine Veo videos will be the ad trend of 2025.\" So for those of you who don't know, Kalshi is a legal betting site where you can bet on anything. And let's look at the ad that they just dropped for the NBA Finals with PJ. Indiana going to win, baby. We're in Florida asking people what they put their money on. I'm all in on OKC. Indiana got that dog in them. Will egg prices go up this month? I think we'll hit $20. How many hurricanes do you think we'll have this year?\n\nKalshi lets you legally trade on anything anywhere in the US. OKC.\n\nNow, as an aside, as someone who loves the art of a good brand tagline, \"the world's gone mad, trade,\" it is maybe the most perfectly aligned with our modern moment tagline I've ever seen for a company. In any case, PJ then goes on to share the process that he used to build this. His general process is one, write a script, two, use Gemini to turn it into a shot list and prompts, three, paste it into Veo, and then four, edit it in Cap Cut or some other platform. He also shared a little bit more of the concept. He writes, \"Kalshi asked me to create a spot about people betting on various markets, including the NBA Finals.\" He said, \"The best VO3 content is crazy people doing crazy things while showcasing your brand.\" He then went on, \"They love GTA 6. I grew up in Florida. The idea wrote itself on the scripting.\" He says, \"I asked their team for a few dialogue bits they wanted to include. Then I came up with 10 wild characters in unhinged situations to say them. I co-wrote with Gemini or Chat GBT, asking it for ideas, picking the best ones, and shaping them into a simple script. I then asked Gemini to take the script and convert every shot into a detailed Veo prompt. I always tell it to return five prompts at a time. Any more detailed than that and the quality starts to slip. Each prompt should fully describe the scene as if Veo had no context of the shot before or after it. Redescribe the setting, the character, and the tone every time to maintain consistency. He then goes on to add a bunch of other prompting tips. Ultimately, he said this took about 300 to 400 generations to get 15 usable clips. one person, two to three days. A 95% cost reduction, he said, versus traditional ads. Now, PJ did point out, just because this was cheap doesn't mean anyone can do it. I've been a director 15 plus years. Brands still pay a premium for taste. The future is small teams making viral brand adjacent content weekly, getting 80 to 90% of the results for way less. I think PJ's right about the taste. I think he's wrong about the 80 90% of the results, as we'll get into in just a minute. But this ad is actually playing during the NBA Finals and so I think reflects a pretty significant moment in the evolution of AI advertising. So what might some of the implications be? Well, the obvious one is that costs come down dramatically.\n\nOne thing that we should note is that already in advertising significantly more is spent on the media cost, i.e. where you place the ad than on the creative itself. For an ad that costs a couple million dollars in production, it's probably going to be the headliner of a 20 million plus campaign. Still, when you can get really high-quality video ads at a tenth of the cost now, it's going to have some dramatic implications for how things play out. And one of those is the sheer variety and amount of content go up. In many, if not most cases, advertisers aren't going to look at their current $2 to 5 million production budgets for a campaign and say, \"Great, we only have to spend $200,000 now. We can save all that and put it into media,\" although that's certainly one possibility. Instead, I think that they make more assets. The variety and amount of content go up and specifically get customized audience by audience. Already, advertisers try to think about how different parts of their audience are going to react to different versions of content. And I think that customization and personalization is going to get massively more important as part of campaign planning because we just have the capability to do more of that customization. Specific audiences are going to get specific content that's tailored for them. Now, this creates a really interesting opportunity as well. Some channels where people receive content already have the ability to customize them in a pretty automatic way. Specifically, if you are interacting with advertising content on any sort of social media platform, the whole value proposition of that media platform for advertisers is that they know so much more about their users that they can really get the right ad to the right audience at the right time. However, there still are other places that people consume media. And I think that we're likely to see new personalization infrastructure that actually helps route the right content to the right people at the right time. Think for example smart TVs that have small on-device models that are constantly learning about their user behavior that are able to interact with advertising distribution mechanisms to put specific versions of specific content in front of you based on what they see about you and your habits. Interestingly, however, as much as the technology is enabling this, there are also some headwinds. One of them is, of course, the legal battles around copyright. Big new news on that front. Disney and Universal have sued Midjourney for copyright infringement. They alleged that the company's AI models were trained on their copyrighted materials and easily reproduce characters like Shrek, Darth Vader, and Minions. The complaint states, \"Midjourney is the quintessential copyright freewriter and a bottomless pit of plagiarism.\" Kim Harris, the general counsel for NBC Universal, said that the companies filed the suit to quote, \"protect the hard work of all the artists whose work entertains and inspires us and the significant investment we make in our content.\" Now, let's be clear. Whatever you think about Midjourney or AI training practices in general, this is not about the artists who produce the content. This is about the investment in that content. These companies have become gigantic IP holders over the years, accumulating tons of properties through acquisition. Disney's acquisition of Marvel and Lucasfilm were some of the biggest entertainment deals in history, adding properties like X-Men and Star Wars. Disney also acquired 21st Century Fox in 2019, bringing The Simpsons into their IP empire. Disney's chief legal and compliance officer, Horatio Gutierrez, says, \"We are bullish on the promise of AI technology and optimistic about how it can be used responsibly to further human creativity. But piracy is piracy, and the fact that it's done by an AI company does not make it any less infringing.\" Now, this lawsuit is a little different from the numerous other copyright infringement cases being fought by the major AI labs. Thus far, most of the cases have largely dealt with the use of copyright material in training data. Plaintiffs have struggled to make the AI models reproduce written works word for word. And that fact has allowed the labs to make a fairly arguable claim that AI training is fair use. In this case, plaintiffs have produced dozens of examples of images generated by Midjourney that depict copyrighted characters. The complaint stated, \"This case is not a close call under well settled copyright law. This is textbook copyright infringement.\"\n\nNow, as you guys know, usually at this point, I would go get you a bunch of takes from Twitter/X. But honestly, when it comes to these copyright battles, the only takes are the screeching screeds from the people who have made it their life's work to take down these AI companies. And while I am not at all being dismissive of their passion or their beliefs, it is somewhat ironic to me that the dislike of AI for some runs so deep that they're cheering for mega IP holders like Disney over small startups like Midjourney. But that's just where we are. One interesting set of commentary came from Immad Must, the founder and former leader of Stability AI. He wrote, \"Some thoughts on the Midjourney lawsuit, having spent millions of dollars on lawyers for similar and ensuring we did everything legal and by the book at Stability. The case itself is pretty thin on legal grounds based on outputs. Inputs will be where the real case is. Hopefully all done by the book, as that's a dangerous one based on jurisdiction and sources. It's puzzling that Midjourney apparently didn't engage with Disney and Universal when they were contacted in December. It seems the plaintiffs want outputs blocked which could be easy settlement versus punishment. So imagine that will be how this ends. Google Image, etc. use fully licensed inputs and have lawsuit protection on output as part of service. Chinese labs don't really care about inputs or outputs. Open source models from them have another legal status.\"\n\nNow, those same folks that I was just mentioning got all up in his replies, asking him to please look at all of their work exposing Midjourney for the copyright stealer that they believe it is, but he just wasn't budging. He said, \"I did see and read it all as well as the whole case document. The overall case is weak legally, as I note, having spent a huge amount of money and time understanding the law, precedent, and more.\" Now, ultimately, this is all a bunch of armchair legal analysts, and these cases are, as I have said before, 100% going to end up in Supreme Court. In fact, I think that almost all the legal decisions along the way until we get to Supreme Court are more or less completely irrelevant. There's just no way any copyright issues are getting decided by anything less than the Supreme Court. And so, it's kind of just a waiting game for all of these lawsuits to work their way up through the system to finally get there. What's more interesting for our purposes is to ask what would happen if this did end up in a big victory for Disney and Universal. Well, one possibility, as Ahmad points out, is that if these companies are simply trying to block outputs, that's an easy settlement that could mean it never gets there. A second possibility, however, and one that seems extremely likely to me, is that the industry just shifts over to models that have been trained on licensed content. There are numerous companies positioning to be the recipient of that opportunity. Many of the people who allow allowed us by the way on Twitter and other channels about copyright infringement are leaders of those models which is always helpful context to understand where someone's perspective is coming from. But the big labs are also thinking about this as well. So again another possibility if this goes to Supreme Court and it does get decided against the AI companies is that simply a different set of AI models that were previously behind but frankly might be caught up by the time that the Supreme Court makes its decisions step in and from a user perspective it's all functionally the same. Another possibility is that one of these AI companies that's getting sued just goes scorched earth in crypto and goes fully decentralized, obiating the traditional structure of a company that could get sued in the first place. I don't think that's the most likely outcome, but it's certainly one possibility. But then lurking around all of this is of course China. There are a huge number of Chinese models, many of which are open source, which are going to have a very different respect or lack thereof for any sort of copyright consideration. And they will persistently be available throughout the entire time that all these legal battles are happening. One of the really interesting real-world contexts that I don't know how it doesn't shape to some extent at least the way that the legal system looks at this is that this genie is fully out of the bottle. And when it comes to what companies do, there's no way they're going back to not using AI. If existing US-based models get banned for copyright infringement, people are just going to start using the Chinese models. Does the US need to then ban Chinese models or block companies from using them? Reasonable questions, but think about the precedent that we're starting to set there of how much control government and the legal system have over the decisions that businesses make. Point is\n\n\nIt's messy.\nUltimately, the TLDDR is that AI video is happening one way or another.\nIt's happening because people are going with bootleg Chinese models or because the Supreme Court rejects the copyright arguments or a fairly likely outcome that some company is in a position to take advantage of a legal decision if it goes against the current crop of AI companies.\nIn the meantime, people are just going to keep innovating and releasing products.\nMidjourney, for example, appears very close to releasing their video generation model, and it's exactly as aesthetically pleasing as you would expect a model from Midjourney to be.\nPoint, guys, is that advertising is changing.\nIt is changing fast.\nIt is changing at an accelerated rate.\nAnd we have an AI generated couch alien in the middle of a party premiering live all over the US as part of the NBA Finals right now.\nThat's going to do it for today's AI Daily Brief.\nAppreciate you listening or watching as always and until next time, peace.\n",
