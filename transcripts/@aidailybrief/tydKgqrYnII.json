  "cleanText": "A number of companies have recently gone AI first, but what does that mean in practice?\nWelcome back to the AI Daily Brief headlines edition.\nAll the daily AI news you need in around 5 minutes.\nOver the last couple of months, we have had a number of companies declaring themselves to be AI first.\nWe've had Dolingo, Shopify.\nFiverr CEO wrote a note about how AI was coming for every job.\nMaybe the earliest to this trend, however, over the last couple of years was Klarna, a buy now pay later company that's been one of the early guinea pigs for pushing AI adoption.\nGiven that they've been in the midst of this AI overhaul the longest, they give us in some ways the best chance to see what's working and what's not.\nYou might remember that last year they announced that they had used AI to develop their own internal systems that allowed them to cut out Salesforce and workday.\nCEO Sebastian Samowski later acknowledged that the cost savings from ripping out 1,200 SAS services hadn't been great.\nThe value, he said, had been in developing their own tech stack that fueled productivity and wouldn't have been possible without AI.\nWe also heard that the company had stopped all hiring in 2023 with plans to enlist AI to replace the human workforce, largely focused on customer service roles.\nAnd this has been a key hallmark of some of these AI first announcements that we've seen recently.\nBasically, a soft freeze on new hiring until you could prove that AI couldn't do the job.\nHowever, earlier this month, Klarna did tweak their strategy.\nWhile most news had reported it as reversing course, it wasn't exactly that.\nInstead, what Klarna figured out is that there was always going to be a demand among some number of their customers to have access to a human customer service agent.\nAnd so, while they were still very keen on using AI to increase efficiency in customer service, they also wanted to respond to customer demand and have this available as an option.\nNow, in my mind, this has always been the way that this was going to shake out.\nAnd in fact, I think the opportunity is to take human level customer service and actually make it a prestige position in the same way that it is in luxury industries.\nFor example, the latest that we've gotten from Klarna is not announcements, but actual financials.\nThe company is now on track to reach $1 million in revenue per employee.\nThat's almost double their pace from a year ago.\nKlarna says that most functions have become more efficient because of their AI efforts.\nLooking strictly at the numbers, the largest impact has been from a significant cost reduction in customer service.\nOverall, the company says that they've seen a 40% reduction in workforce since they began their AI overhaul in 2022.\nThe trade-off has been a big jump in one-time costs related to downsizing.\nThe company made a $92 million loss last quarter due to severance related restructuring costs.\nKlarna is currently looking to go public, although those plans are now on hold.\nSo, there are a lot of expenses related to paying out stock awards.\nMore troubling for Klarna, not from the standpoint of AI, but just from the standpoint of the industry they're operating in, the company also reported a 17% rise in losses from defaulted consumer loans in the first quarter compared to the previous year.\nThese bad debts are now running at 136 million per quarter.\nA spokesperson noted that the default rate has risen from 0.51% to 0.54%.\nSo, quote, \"A very slight increase, but still very low.\"\nThese challenges are not due to AI, but due to broader economic conditions, but they are a good reminder that efficiency isn't everything, and companies won't be able to use AI as a magic bullet that somehow shields them from broader market forces.\nStill, they continue to put AI front and center.\nThe earnings call this week was conducted by an AI avatar of their CEO.\nTechCrunch writes, \"Other than AICowski's admission, it wasn't obvious that this was AI.\nThere were only a few subtle signs.\nThe AI CEO didn't blink as much as most humans do.\nThe voice inc was good but not perfect.\nAnd the AI was also wearing a brown jacket that looked a lot like one from a widely circulated corporate photo of his human self.\nSo troubling economic conditions or not, Klarna is still very much on the AI train.\nShopify, meanwhile, have launched a slew of new AI tools to help users design their shopping experience.\nThere's an end-to-end store builder allowing users to generate an entire storefront from a single prompt.\nThere's an AI generator for creating elements like banners without knowing how to code.\nThere's also a big upgrade to Sidekick, the platform's commerce assistant with added voice and screen sharing capabilities.\nThere's also the ability to draw real-time product data from the millions of Shopify stores.\nAs another bonus, Shopify have set up their own MCP server to make integration with external agents seamless, which will for some be a footnote in the news, but I think actually could be the most significant part of this whole announcement.\nGiven how much we've talked about the productization of AI over the past week, all of this news from Shopify is a really good example.\nThe platform was always designed as a noode tool to empower everyday people to dive into e-commerce, but until now that was through the customization of templates.\nWe're now starting to see vibe coding concepts integrated into noode platforms, making them much more open-ended.\nThe suite is also a good example of taking a broad concept like AI coding assistance and narrowing them down into a user-friendly package.\nI am 100% sure that this will not be the last example of this this year, but it is a really good demonstration of how AI is on the cusp of changing everything in the consumer software industry.\nSpeaking of coding agents, Mistl have launched their first open-source coding agent model called Devstrol.\nThe product is a small 24 billion parameter model optimized to drive a software engineering agent.\nBaptiste Rosier, a research scientist at Mistl, said, \"We wanted to release something open for the developer and enthusiast community, something they can run locally, privately, and modify as they want.\nThis model is small enough to run on consumer grade hardware and is licensed under Apache 2.0, so devs can pretty much use it however they want.\nIt benchmarks well compared to other small models.\"\nWith Sophie Yang, the company's head of developer relations, writing, \"Compare Devstral to closed and open models evaluated under any scaffold.\nWe find that devstril achieves substantially better performance than a number of closed source alternatives.\nAnd the idea isn't just to provide a high performance model, but to pair it with a common open source agentic framework like openhand, sui agent and open devon.\nRoger said we're releasing it with open devon which is a scaffolding for code agents.\nWe built the model and they build the scaffolding a set of prompts and tools that the model can use like a backend for the developer model.\nCompany continues to experiment in filling in market gaps.\nRoger said, \"There will always be a gap between smaller and larger models, but we've gone a long way in bridging that.\"\nLastly today, benchmarking platform LM Arena has raised a hundred million in a seed round that values the company at 600 million.\nWhat started off as an academic project is now a commercial startup with backing from Andre Horowitz and the University of California Investment Fund.\nLightseed, Felicus, and Kleiner Perkins are also participating.\nUntil now, the platform had been funded by a combination of grants and donations from sources like Google, Together AI, and A16Z.\nThe platform has also faced a lot of scrutiny over this past year.\nThey were central to allegations that Meta had gained their benchmarks when releasing Llama for Maverick, which revealed that the platform allows AI labs to submit multiple different versions of their models that are specifically fine-tuned to perform well in the head-to-head testing.\nIt seems as though this fundraising marks a good time for a fresh start, however, with LM Marina writing, \"We're focused on building a neutral, open, communitydriven platform that helps the world understand and improve the performance of AI models on real queries from real users.\"\nAlso, big news is coming next week.\nWe're relaunching LM Marina with a whole new look built directly with community feedback from the ground up.\nI kind of think we're at the point where there's enough criticism of benchmarks that we're actually likely to see some more innovation in that space.\nSo that is something I will be keeping a close eye on.\nFor now, that is going to do it for today's AI daily brief headlines edition.\n",
