  "cleanText": "First, it was Perplexity, and now we're hearing about Mistral.\nIs it possible that Apple is finally getting together its strategy on AI and is thinking about a big acquisition to anchor it?\nWelcome back to The AI Daily Brief headlines edition.\nAll the daily AI news you need in around 5 minutes.\nWe kick off today with the latest in the Apple AI saga, where Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has mentioned almost half-hazardly in a larger piece about Apple's changing strategy that they are seriously considering an acquisition of Mistral.\nNow, as always, it's not clear that Mistral is interested in said acquisition.\nIt's not clear that Europe regulators would allow said acquisition, but it's interesting that these types of reports are now getting more commonplace, especially given how resistant to acquiring its way out of problems Apple has been in the past.\nNot much more to go on for this, but I think taken alongside the Perplexity interest from a couple of weeks ago, it feels like Apple is preparing to make some big move.\nAnd goodness gracious, it couldn't come soon enough.\nNow, speaking of acquisitions, we have a follow-up story on the Windsurf deal.\nThe whirlwind continues for the team left at Windsurf as that leftover crew and the company itself have now been formally acquired by Cognition, who are the creators of Devon.\nYesterday, we covered Google's Aqua Hire deal that saw Windsurf's leaders and around 30 developers join Google.\nThat deal left behind a couple of hundred staff members and was controversial for being part of the continued breakup of the social contract of startup exits.\nGoogle paid 2.4 billion for the licensing agreement.\nHowever, reports suggested that it mostly went to pay out early investors and the 30 developers joining them rather than the rest of the staff.\nThe consensus opinion was that the remaining staff who now owned Windsurf would have to do something like split the 100 million in the treasury and wind down the company.\nAnd yet later on Monday, news broke that rival AI startup Cognition had acquired the remains of Windsurf for an undisclosed sum.\nJeff Wang, Windsurf's former head of business, saw himself thrust into the interim CEO role on Friday after the rest of the executives left.\nIn a LinkedIn post, he wrote, \"The last 72 hours have been the wildest roller coaster ride of my career.\nI'm beyond thrilled to share that Windsurf is joining forces with Cognition, the legendary team behind Devon to reinvent the future of software development.\nWindsurf has built the leading in IDE agentic experience and Cognition has pioneered the leading autonomous software agent.\nTogether, we're going to redefine the future of software development.\nCognition noted that Windsurf will now have full access to Anthropic's Cloud models again, which goes a long way to making the product viable.\nAnd more importantly for Windsurf staff, Cognition CEO Scott Woo reinforced that quote, \"One of my top priorities in structuring this deal was to honor their talent, hard work, and accomplishments in making Windsurf the great business that it is today.\"\nTo that end, Jeff and I work together to ensure that every single employee is treated with respect and well taken care of in this transaction.\nSo, is this the new mode of acquisitions?\nOne company acquires the founders and leading engineers and then someone else acquires the rest of the company.\nI don't know, but it's certainly a good ending for the story, at least for Windsurf's engineers.\nNext up, an interesting one out of Meta.\nThe new Superintelligence Lab is considering switching to closed source models.\nThe New York Times reports that top members of the new lab have discussed abandoning Meta's large Llama 4 behemoth model in favor of developing a closed model from scratch.\nBehemoth was not included in the April release of Llama 4 with rumors that the training run had produced unimpressive performance.\nA switch to closed models would be a huge philosophical shift for Meta.\nSurrounding the release of the first Llama model in February 2023, Meta said that they were making it open as part of their commitment to open science.\nThey wrote, \"Even with all the recent advancements in large language models, full research access to them remains limited because of the resources that are required to train and run such large models.\nThis restricted access has limited researchers ability to understand how and why these LLMs work, hindering progress on efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues.\nNow, on the one hand, many saw this as a ruthless commercial decision rather than an altruistic move.\nChat EBT had been released just a few months prior, and the commercial logic was presumed to be that a free Meta Chatbot would quickly overtake the competition.\nNow keep in mind this was a very different era in AI.\nThe first public release of Anthropic's Claude was still a month away and Gemini was way way in the future.\nMeta's chief AI scientist Yan Lun said the platform that will win will be the open one.\nAnd to be fair to Zuckerberg, he has really hated being under Apple's thumb.\nSo he does have a philosophical disposition towards this even if there were probably commercial reasons as well.\nStill, when it comes to if they're actually shifting the strategy, Meta has so far denied it.\nThey commented, \"We plan to continue releasing leading open source models.\nWe haven't released everything we've developed historically, and we expect to continue training a mix of open and closed models going forward.\nHonestly, I think we're just going to have to wait and see what will happen now that we've got this new Superintelligence Lab in play, and we don't even know how much their mandate is about commercial products in the short term versus some bigger longer term goal.\"\nOne more on Meta.\nAlongside their massive spend on AI talent, they're also planning to build out a whole lot of compute.\nIn a post on Thread, Zuckerberg wrote, \"For our super intelligence effort, I'm focused on building the most elite and talent dense team in the industry.\nWe're also going to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into compute to build super intelligence.\nWe have the capital from our business to do this.\nSemi analysis just reported that Meta is on track to be the first lab to bring a 1 gigawatt supercluster online.\nWe're actually building several multi-gigawatt clusters.\nWe're calling the first one Prometheus, and it's coming online in 26.\nWe're also building Hyperion, which will be able to scale up to 5 GW over several years.\nWe're building multiple more Titan clusters as well.\nJust one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan.\nMeta Super Intelligence Labs will have industryleading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher.\nXAI's Colossus Supercluster currently operates at around 250 megawatt, although they have plans to increase its capacity five-fold to 1.2 gigawatt.\nThe first Project Stargate data center in Aberdine, Texas, aims to have 1 gigawatt of compute online by the beginning of next year, but that timeline is starting to look a little stretched.\nAdding some details, a Meta spokesperson said the target is to have 2 gigawatts operational at the Hyperion facility by 2030 and then expand to 5 gigawatts within a few years.\nIn an interview with the information, Zuckerberg discussed how mega clusters aren't just necessary for Meta super intelligence plan.\nThey're also a key recruiting tool.\nHe said, \"A lot has been written about money and a lot of the numbers have been inaccurate, but I think it discounts the other key reason why people are super excited to come work at Meta Super Intelligence Labs.\nOne of the biggest is just that you have more leverage as a researcher.\nYou have more compute.\nHistorically, when I was recruiting people to different parts of the company, people asked, \"What's my scope going to be?\"\nHere, people say, \"I want the fewest people reporting to me and the most GPUs.\"\nHaving basically the most compute per researcher is a strategic advantage, not just for doing the work, but for attracting the best people.\nIn other words, it all comes back to talent.\nThat however is going to do it for today's The AI Daily Brief headlines edition.\nNext up, the main episode.\n",
