  "cleanText": "Welcome back to The AI Daily Brief headlines edition.\nAll the daily AI news you need in around 5 minutes.\nIt's rare that we have a day that is chalk full of headlines and has a big thick juicy main, but that is exactly the story of today.\nIn our main episode, we will of course be talking about 03's cost reduction and 03 Pro being released.\nBut when it comes to mainstream media covering AI, it is in fact a different story that is dominating headlines.\nThat is of course the report that Meta is about to pay about $15 billion dollars for 49% of data labeling startup Scale AI.\nThe company is taking non-voting shares.\nAnd obviously that 49% is very clearly designed to get around antitrust scrutiny, which is just a fact of life for all big tech companies now despite the shifted administrations.\nOne thing that has not really changed between the two, is that big tech is very much in the antitrust hot seat.\nImportantly though, this is not just an acquisition, and it's not even really that it would be Meta's biggest acquisition to date that's causing attention.\nThe New York Times broke that this is also part of a larger shakeup in AI leadership at Meta.\nThey wrote that Meta is preparing to unveil a new super intelligence lab with 28-year-old Scale AI CEO Alexander Wang at the helm.\nSeveral other Scale AI employees are expected to join Meta.\nAnd sources say that multiple 7 to nine figure offers have been made to dozens of researchers from other leading AI labs.\nIn other words, if this report is correct, Meta is rolling out compensation packages ranging up to hundreds of millions of dollars to poach top AI talent.\nThe news of course comes in the context of multiple changes to AI leadership at Meta.\nAfter reportedly being panicked by the release of Deepseek and failing to impress with their own Llama for model, some have seen Meta as being in a bit of a crisis.\nBloomberg reports that Mark Zuckerberg himself is personally overseeing this new team, writing, \"Zuckerberg has prioritized recruiting for the secretive new team, referred to internally as a super intelligence group. He has an audacious goal in mind. In his view, Meta can and should outstrip other tech companies in achieving AGI.\"\nBloomberg sources say that the team is being hired up to around 50 people, including presumably Wang at the head of it.\nNow, what we don't have is information about current leadership at Facebook like Yan Lun, but Zuckerberg's focus definitely appears to be this team.\nThose same Bloomberg sources say that Zuckerberg has rearranged desks so the new staff will sit nearer to him.\nNow, interestingly, a lot of folks privately asked me what I thought the deal was here.\nWhile Scale AI's business is very successful and seems to be growing, they reportedly had 870 million in revenue last year and are on track for 2 billion this year.\nThat's very clearly not the reason for Zuck to make this acquisition.\nIt also doesn't seem like the natural place to go hunting for research talent, as that's not really what Scale does.\nThe narrative that people have settled on quite quickly is about competition around data.\nScale AI is somewhat unique as the largest startup providing data labeling services at scale.\nThey have over 100,000 global contractors working on labeling images, video, and text.\nNow, at the beginning, that was mostly about pre-training, but increasingly it's about higher order reinforcement learning from human feedback, which continues to be a key part of not only model advancement, but also things like compliance in new regimes like the EU's AI act.\nMany other people have the same thought that maybe this is Zuckerberg's way of cutting off competition from data.\nAnd who knows, that may be part of it.\nIt does feel to me from the outside though that if that is a part of it, it is only one part of it.\nFor whatever reason, it feels to me like Zuck is fairly convinced that Alexander Wang is the new force in the new energy that he needs to bring in from a leadership position for AI inside of Meta to write the ship.\nThe price that we're seeing may simply be the cost that it took to get him there with Zuckerberg being able to justify all the rest based on yes, their business model of course, but also the privileged position it puts them in vis-a-vis others who need their services.\nI would say overall the tone and tenor of the response is skeptical.\nSignal writes, \"So, let me get this straight. Meta's AI strategy is just brute forcing with cash again. What's the vision? Just spending their way into the super intelligence race? Feels a lot like the metaverse play. Overfunded, underthought, and wildly disconnected from how people perceive these experiences. Am I missing something? Flooding the zone with capital just breeds distorted incentives and likely shallow execution.\"\nIndeed, on that incentive line, some people pointed out that the payday for Alexander Wang on this is going to be something like $4.2 billion.\nAnd so, is he actually going to show up at Meadow with fire in his belly, or is he going to be just wanting to go off in Gallivant and party?\nFor that, we will have to wait and see, but that was far from the only news over the last day or so.\nOne story that is getting some traction is that it appears that Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump is weighing on his AI fundraising.\nLast week, it was reported that XAI was looking to raise 5 billion in debt funding.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Morgan Stanley had gathered XAI executives on Thursday afternoon to pitch the debt to investors.\nThat is the same Thursday afternoon that Musk himself was teeing off against the administration.\nThe Journal even reported that investors were following Elon's tweets on their phones while the presentation was underway.\nNow, so far, this doesn't really seem to have affected things.\nThe Journal writes, \"So far, buyers who showed initial interest haven't backed off. Indeed, demand for both the debt and equity sale has actually increased since Thursday, said one adviser to the company.\nNow, it feels like a pretty big grain of salt, as that's obviously the narrative that you would want.\nBut maybe it's all an overblown story given that Elon is officially starting to walk back his position, tweeting this morning, I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week.\nThey went too far.\nFor a very long time, Elon has had a basically blank check when it comes to his companies.\nAnd so it will be very interesting indeed to see if that is starting to run out or as it seems might be the case, this ends up being just a very temporary bump.\nOne company that is not having any trouble getting interest for fundraising is Lovable.\nThe company is apparently in talks to raise $100 million at a $1.5 billion valuation, which honestly I could argue is kind of cheap.\nAt the end of May, CEO Antona shared that the company had crossed 60 million ARR and that growth was up 50% week-over-week.\nThis is a company that still only has like 28 employees.\nAnd obviously, if you listen to the show regularly, you know how central I think Vibe Coding will be to our future.\nAnd so, it makes total sense to me that there's this big interest.\nAnd for those wondering why they would raise this money given how much money they're making, the short answer is that this is going to be one of the most hotly contested spaces in all of AI, and it's just going to take resources to compete.\nIf the story gets confirmed, I will of course share it here.\nBut for now, that is going to do it for today's AI daily brief headlines edition.\n",
