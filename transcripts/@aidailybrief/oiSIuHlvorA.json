  "cleanText": "Today on The AI Daily Brief, how to\ndesign an AI native Engineering\nOrganization. Today, as I am traveling,\nwe have a different type of episode. I'm\njoined today by serial entrepreneur\nBrian Elliot and Sid Pardeshi, an\nex-Nvidia software architect with 27\ngenerative AI patents to his name. Sid\nand Brian are the co-founders of\nBlitzy.com, which of course you have\nheard me talk about as a sponsor. Now,\nto be clear, Blitzy sponsorship does not\ninclude a sponsored episode. This is\nsomething that came out of a bunch of\nconversations that I had had with Brian\nand Sid offline that I thought would be\ninteresting to share. Coding is\nobviously at this point one of, if not\nthe most transformative use case of AI,\nparticularly when you think about in the\nenterprise. It's also a use case that\nopens up more use cases and compounds\nthe rate at which everything is\nchanging. And so I think even for folks\nwho are not building or in Engineering\nOrganizations, understanding what's\nhappening in and around AI and agentic\ncoding is incredibly important. In this\nshow, we talk about the barriers holding\nAI coding back in the enterprise,\nspecific types of investments\nenterprises can be making to make\nagentic coding work better, and\nultimately try to get into a blueprint\nfor the modern AI native Engineering\nOrganization. It's a fun conversation,\nso let's dive in. Hello sir, welcome to\nThe AI Daily Brief. How's it going? NLW.\nLet's get into it. Glad to be here.\nYeah. No, it's great to have you here.\nWe're we're talking today about I think\na topic that is you got to say at this\npoint that if there is one definitive\nlike just no denying it use case for AI\nspecifically when it comes to sort of\nbusiness and business operations, it's\ncoding, right? Like everything else\nthere tons and tons of things that are\nchanging productivity and changing how\npeople do their jobs. When it comes to\nlike really rethinking fundamental\nstructures, things that you could get\nfired for not doing, reimagining sort of\nthe Engineering function with the new\nopportunity of AI and agents is pretty\nhigh on that list and so we're going to\ndig into that a little bit today and\nwhere I want to start is almost more\nbroad, right? Like for people who are\nnot paying attention to sort of every\nshift and change when it comes to AI and\ncoding and you know agentic coding, what\nis the landscape right now? What is it\nbeing used for? Is it primarily just\nsort of on the startup or individual\nside? You what what is the state of\nmodels? Kind of like what take us into\nthe picture of AI and agent coding\nbroadly speaking in mid 2025.\nYeah, let me give a band of the simplest\nuse case and the most complex use case\nand this is being adopted across\nstartups and enterprise. So from a\nsimple use case perspective you have\nGitHub copilot, you have cursor, you\nhave these tools where you can give them\na little bit of intent, say I want to\ncreate a function that creates a login\nscreen and that's going to give you back\nsome code, a few hundred lines of code\nand that's really useful because\ndevelopers don't remember a specific\nsyntax for a language or they want this\nto work with their specific brand\nguidelines or they're doing something on\nthe front end, you can provide that to\nthe co-pilot so that engineer within\ntheir IDE is going to be 20, 30% more\nefficient and for somebody that costs\n$100,000, $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 a\nyear depending on where you're based and\nhow skilled you are, that is meaningful\nwhen extrapolated across the enterprise.\nSo that's where we're started on the\nsimple use case. Now if you go to the\nother end of the spectrum you can think\nabout how long is that agentic system\nthinking and validating before providing\nthe code back. So on the first part of\nthe system where we had just the\nco-pilot, it's immediate response with\nthe IDE getting you something that might\nwork or make you go faster versus\nthinking something like deep research\nwhich we're all familiar with from a\nsort of research report generation\nperspective where you are able to\nagentically improve the quality of the\ncode. And these are these much more\nagentic solutions that you're thinking\nabout where you have tools like Devon or\nFactory that are going to take 30\nminutes to come back and get you a chunk\nof work that might be hundreds or\nthousands of lines of code that is\ntaking into account all the\nrelationships around that. And then you\nhave Blitzy which is going to take 12\nhours or a few days or we've had\nmulti-week runs, right? Where you're\ngoing to be accounting for tens of\nmillions, 20 million, 30 million lines\nof code and delivering huge chunks of\nwork, right? And so you really have all\nthe way from a little bit of intent, a\nlittle bit of code to huge amounts of\ninfrastructs of code ultimately\ndelivering productivity whether it's 30%\nor 300% really depends on the approach\nthe enterprise is taking. Yeah. And if\nyou dig deeper into Brian's response,\nright, he focused on the modus\noperandi or the use of the tool. There's\nalso something interesting to look at\nfrom a use case standpoint, right? So if\nyou're looking at prototyping or\nbuilding something that you can quickly\ndemonstrate how it looks like in the UI,\nright? If you're a product manager at an\nenterprise, then it's very easy to use\nsomething like Figma Make or Google\nStitch and get something out there quick\nthat you can share a URL and have\nsomeone to see it. If you're doing\nsomething a little bit more complicated\nlike maybe a GitHub issue or a Jira\nticket that's a full feature or a bug,\nright? Then probably it makes sense to\nuse something like an IDE tool and even\nBlitzy plays into that space. But the\npoint there is like you're writing\nhundreds if not thousands of lines of\ncode, right? But what if you're doing\nlarge scale modernizations,\nrefactors, that's where Blitzy and some\nof these other tools can help you where\nyou need very large scale context,\nright? Like particularly for Blitzy,\nit's like we've pioneered infinite\neffective code context. I'm sure we'll\ntalk about that later. But it's about\nkeeping context across multiple\nrepositories, modules, systems, and\nproducing something that the humans can\nthen review and take to production\neventually. So, okay. So, here's where I\nwant to go with this cuz I think it's\ninteresting. One of the things that has\nbeen surprising over call it the last 6\nmonths is how frequently it is the\nEngineering departments of\nOrganizations that we're interacting\nwith, you know, with these agent\nreadiness audits and things like that\nthat are blockers to work. And\nsometimes it feels for very kind of, you\nknow, personal reasons like they chose a\nvery cushy position for a specific\nreason and don't really want to work all\nthat much harder. But let's hold that\naside. There have been a set of kind of\ncomplaints or just observations about\nhow not enterprise ready certain tools\nare but it seems like that's just based\non your answer that's sort of changing\nfast. What has held back enterprise\nadoption of these processes on on\nwhatever end of that spectrum it is.\nYeah, I feel uh very strongly for this\npersonally. So the I think we we talk a\nlot a lot about from a from it from a\ntechnological standpoint but also\nthere's the mindset standpoint that you\nspoke about a change management. If you\nthink about the approach that the AI\ntools are taking today, it's like let's\nwork with the human, right? Let's take\nsome instructions from the human, get\nsomething back, review it, and push it.\nAnd that's kind of like the easy way to\ndo it cuz essentially you're you're like\nbuilding like a wrapper around Claude or\nGemini or some of the other models, and\nthen you're building something that's a\nquicker response. And that is a response\nto the enterprise where the enterprise\ndoesn't trust the models, right? You\nhave LLMs that can produce code, but\nthat code necessarily isn't the most\nhigh quality. You still have to spend\ntime validating it, fixing it, and\nmaking sure it really adheres to your\nenterprises best practices and whatnot.\nChallenge really for moving forward to\nthe next step is how do we get\nenterprises to trust the AI, right? As\nof today, AI is probably the bottleneck.\nIt's just not good enough for the humans\nto blindly trust it. But given the\nadvances that we're seeing with new\nmodel releases like every couple of\nmonths between like cloud 3.7 and cloud\n4, what's going to quickly happen is\nthat humans will become the bottleneck\nand the enterprises that are not quick\nat adopting the AI tools today are going\nto be significantly lacking at that\npoint because they were slow to get the\nmindset change. In terms of\ntechnological adoption, we're not seeing\nlike a huge lead time in adopting an AI\ntool. If you really clear all of the\nhurdles and from a the security\nbackground checks and all of that, once\nyou do that, like integrating is like\nliterally a matter of days, right? But\nthe hurdle or the biggest challenge for\nenterprise AI adoption is really getting\nyour most senior architects to change\ntheir mindsets and perspectives on AI on\nchanging how you build code. Like for\nexample, rather than, you know, writing\nall of the code yourself, letting the AI\nwrite it and finish it off, right?\nHanding it a set of requirements which\nforces you to overcommunicate and\nengineers historically haven't been the\nbest communicators right so how do you\ncross that hurdle, change that mindset,\nincorporate AI into your entire software\nlife cycle, right? And make sure you're\nready for the next wave is where we're\nseeing the biggest challenge. It's very\nhard for the enterprise if you look at\nit from their perspective because there\nare thousands of tools out there and\nmost of these tools are built by very\nvery young entrepreneurs that haven't\nspent time at senior levels within\nthese enterprises. So they don't know\nwhat is important to them from an\nadoption perspective, right? And so like\nthey're building SAS without the ability\nto deploy it within the client's VPC,\nwhich if you're going to work with a\nfinancial services institution, like\nforget about it. They're not going to\nadopt SAS, right? And so they're\nbuilding these solutions without the\nenterprise in mind that have good value,\nbut they're not designed to be procured\nin a way that the enterprise has to\nderisk. And so you need both the\ntechnological advancements to do\nsomething really really compelling but\nyou have to make technical design\ndecisions upfront that is set up for the\nenterprise to adopt how they can\nprocure. Yeah. I mean it feels like this\nis one of the so in our conversations\nwith enterprises who are bringing up\nthese types of issues. It's a a very\nclear skate to where the puck is headed\nmoment when you know because it's just\nthe obvious opportunity for companies in\nthis space to sort of rebuild and\nredesign enterprise Engineering efforts\nis so huge that there's a flood of\ncompanies that are now taking on\ndifferent pieces of that. It's sort of\none of those convenient short-term\nexcuses that you know companies haven't\nbeen set up for that because that's not\ngoing to be the case for very long. One\nof the other things that I wanted to ask\nyou about which I think it's a little\nbit into your architecture and how and\nhow you guys approach some of these\nissues is broadly speaking we're sort of\nin the midst of of an inflection between\nthe assistant era and the agentic era.\nThis involves kind of a a reimagining of\nAI from AI that helps me do stuff to AI\nthat does stuff for me. That all and of\nitself is a pretty big mindset shift\neven for people who have spent the last\ncouple years getting comfortable with\nassistant type tools. However, I think\nthat it still feels that even the folks\nin general who are kind of fully\nembracing and thinking about agents as\ncollaborators and digital employees and\neven starting to imagine, you know,\nteams of agents working together are\nkind of underimagining the full\ncapabilities of when you have sort of\nintelligence too cheap to meter that you\ncan use, you know, at mass scale like\nright like we're still kind of in this\nmindset of replacing my copywriting\nwith an agent rather than imagining, you\nknow, a 100 copywriters who are all\ncompeting, you know, in this sort of,\nyou know, uh, this this war game\nscenario that I've set up. Um, how are\nyou seeing that type of shift happen?\nAnd maybe this is a chance to kind of\ntalk about the the swarms that are a\npart of of what you guys do. Yeah, in\ngeneral, I think people are dramatically\nunderreacting to what is happening in\nthe ecosystem right now. The rate of\nchange is like nothing we've seen in our\nlifetime. And the ability to pivot an\nOrganization to be able to uh be set up\nto give work off to a system and then\nget work back is is fundamentally very\nvery different. You have 20, 30, 40,000\nemployees. You're trying to rearchitect\nthe entire system that's built on people\nhanding off work from one person to the\nother person to the other person. So\nwe've been thinking about how to solve\nthis problem of giving work off to a\nswarm of agents for a very very long\ntime now. And this process is\nfundamentally superior to the human\nbottleneck human in the loop. Right? For\nus, we have human in the loop at very\nspecific checkpoints, but at the point\nwhere the human is sending the work off,\nletting the system get as high quality\nof outcome as possible for whatever it\ncosts and then giving that back to the\nhuman a day or two days later. And so\nyou can talk about how the swarm concept\nwas really invented, pioneered and what\nit means for the enterprise. Yeah, I\nthink I also want to like underscore a\nvery practical example of why this makes\nsense, right? Like I've been leading and\nworking with Engineering teams for a\ndecade plus. And what we've constantly\nseen is that it's not really talent even\nfor humans, right? It's not really\ntalent or the technological limitations\nthat delays projects more than you know\nsomeone would budget them or that you\nknow even causes humans to be relatively\nslower. It's really the cost of\ncommunication, right? Is the fact that\nhumans don't typically work weekends for\nexample, right? It's the fact that you\nhave to go to multiple teams and\nmultiple teams have different incentives\neven within the same company even if the\ncompany is aligned on the same mission\nbut if you look at the swarms of AI\nagents that we know will be\ntechnologically better we've seen that\nhappen for you know the past few years\nand if you roll with that assumption\nthen that system has already solved for\nthe cost of communication they don't\ntake weekends off they're constantly\nworking at the moment maybe not very not\nnot smarter than an average human but\nthey will soon be right. So because\nyou've eliminated that you can just get\nstuff done way faster and once you've\ncrossed the chasm as you mentioned once\nyou've gone from the assistant era to\nthe agentic era you've adopted that\nyou've positioned agents in your\nenterprise you are positioning yourself\nfor what's coming next because as of now\nwe're thinking of agents and or like\nswarms of agents as operating really\nwe're thinking about it in human terms\nuh where I can hand off a task to\nsomeone and they come back with it like\nThat's like a human modus operity. But\nwith the agent swarms and once you've\nperfected this this process, what you're\ngoing to see is systems that can be\noffloaded autonomously to agents like\ncustom\n\n\nError support, for example, I think is a very good use case, just because you have voice agents, you have chat agents, you have the ability to respond to emails, uh, you have the ability to process documentation and understand it. And many times, like the Entropic CEO, Dario Modi, said, like humans also hallucinate, and sometimes humans can hallucinate more than agents. So the problems are similar, right? And it's really hard for a human to keep context of, like, changing documentation, changing processes across the life cycle of the enterprise.\n\nSo AI is like very strongly positioned to, like, automate away entire systems for um, enterprises, and adopting the agents is a starting point to get there. What is this? How does this shape the design of Engineering organizations in the future? What's the combination of, you know, superpowered 10x coders or 100x coders who are using these tools as assistants still, or as sort of, you know, collaborators, plus, you know, teams of agents or swarms of agents that are working, you know, largely or entirely autonomously, plus some sort of new type of engineering management role that's coordinating between these? Like, what does that all look like, and, and maybe, you know, on a one-year time scale and then on a 3 to 5 year time scale? I'll tell you what the best organizations are doing right now, because there are organizations that are on the edge of AI adoption that are going to be what most of the industry looks like in 12 months.\n\nSo we're seeing this right now, where you'll have uh, a senior architect, right? That that has a system-level view of exactly what is going on across the Organization from a codebase context and from a business context. They can finally have the codebase context because Blitzy.com will pull everything together for them and put it inside of a document, right? And they have the business context because they've been there for a long time. That senior person is is so valuable, but that's the person that you're turning from a 10x to 100x, right? That is the person that is expressing intent to this system of action that is going to give it to this form of agents, do a lot of work, right? And you're magnifying everything that architect otherwise would have done if they had infinite time, right? They are expressing exactly what they want down to the nuance level with the help of the system, sending it to the swarm, and then getting back the work, which in this case is code, right? And so we have the senior architect, and then you usually have a couple of junior people, and this is where everyone says, like, oh, all the junior engineers are going to go away, there's going to be no work for them. Those junior engineers that are, you know, two, three, four years of experience now have a place where they have access to understanding the codebase, right? And they have access to tools to level them up, and they can finish out any remaining work that the AI system was not ready for. And people think that, um, okay, so, like, the engineering org size is is going to go down. But engineers have been automating away the work that they've been doing for decades, right? Like, deploying something used to be a whole team's job, right? Like, now, now you can get it done with a little bit of configuration and a click of a button. So engineers are exceptional at automating away the work that they used to do. So they can work on the next level of abstraction that the business needs, because these engineers are just, they're problem solvers, and software is the tool that they're choosing to use. Now AI magnifies their ability to create that. Yeah. And given how broad this spectrum is, right, there's always a use case where you can deploy your engineers to one task or the other and the tools, right? Use them optimally. Like, organizations and enterprises do not realize this often enough, that they always have some sort of a keyband risk, right? And this is like the 10x architect or the person who's been around for, like, 10, 15, 20 years with the company that they that knows things that no one else does. And when every time you bring an engineer on, you hire a new team, new engineer, team of engineers, you keep that person in the meeting and you help them ramp up, right? But what happens if they quit and you don't have that knowledge captured? And the AI tools out there, the swarms of agents can help you document and capture exactly that. And that is a decision that you need to take consciously, that you make sure that happens. And then there's a bunch of use cases that we come to, right? Like, if you have these modernizations, if you have tech dev, which every enterprise has, if you have documentation challenge, it makes sense to have the s of agents take a stab at it, get it done to the best extent possible, and have your uh, junior developers even uh, finish the job, right? Like, like Blitzy.com is, for example, um, an 80% to 20% in terms of time, right? So we Blitzy.com makes you five times faster, but the code that you get is not perfect, so you can have junior developers spend time on finishing that. If it's a large-scale modernization, if you have something else where you have a product manager who's not very technical and they want to build a prototype, you can use the appropriate tools for that. So there are enough silos and specific use cases across the entire enterprise that lets you use a host of tools, and there is work to do for every single skill level within the enterprise.\n\nDo you see that evolving though, as these systems get more advanced? Sort of, you know, is there a narrow band of time in which juniors fit that role, or do you anticipate, because there are going to be kind of continued, as you put it, uh, you know, higher orders of abstraction, there will always be something that sort of, you know, that you're going to want people to augment the AI with? AI is never going to invent something, well, until AGI is here, and then it can learn things, right? But, like, uh, humans are like brilliant.\n\nAnd when you let them focus their time on net new problems that haven't been solved, whether they're 22 or 52, like, they will directionally move the Organization in the right direction. So the type of work that that 22-year-old is going to do is going to be different, but they're going to be empowered to do so much more because they have system-level understanding and a fresh perspective. So, like, as long as that Organization has problems that can be solved through automation, through software, of which the backlog of any Organization is decades long, if they were to actually sit through and work through what are the things that we would have from an optimal software perspective, they usually just catalog it at 3 years and then call it from there, right? And so there will be a next level of work that these Organizations are going to need these really bright, talented young people to do. We don't even know what some of that work is yet, but, like, there might be an approach where an Organization says, \"Great, for a one or two year time horizon, I'm actually going to cut head costs, like, do the do the kind of private equity role and and and get as much free cash flow as possible.\" But that will not be an enduring enterprise, and the Organizations that are going to, like, make it in the long term are the ones that are going to understand, like, people are incredibly valuable. We have to adopt AI across all of our systems so that our people are working on the hardest possible problems that AI can't solve. So for the best Organizations, the answer is they're going nowhere. And, you know, I can speak for this personally, just because I I joined Nvidia straight out of college, and I was there. Nvidia is the only other uh, you know, employer I ever worked for. I was the youngest senior architect from my batch, right? I started as an intern, and I really saw the journey to get there. I think we're talking about how junior developers and we're like saying, you know, they probably are not going to be relevant, like, that's that's what some people are saying, but I think that's completely flawed. What we're going to see in a few years from now, and it could be like 2 to 3 years, is that this paradigm completely shifts. I would in fact say that if I had the tools that these people have access to today, like, you know, like the ability to process large amounts of logs and understand what where the error could be, like, that's where I spent most of my time as a junior developer. The ability to review a document of an entire codebase that was written by someone else and that is an AI, right? And I can follow up and ask it questions and get to know things that I otherwise wouldn't have caught if I did like 10 tickets, right? That's like game-changing, right? We're not seeing enough of that just because uh, you know, college graduates go through this four-year process, and that four-year process in the last four years in particular has completely, like, the technology landscape has completely transformed. So hardly anyone um, has knowledge of AI or how to use these tools, but the universities are adapting, and people are realizing this. Junior engineers realize this. They up the first thing they upskill on is AI, just because the market is gravitating towards AI engineers in general. So what we're going to see is junior engineers who are able to become a 10x engineer far too quickly. It took me uh, 3 years to become a senior engineer. But I think we're going to see junior engineers that become seniors in like one year or less. And I think that this almost goes without saying, but is worth kind of putting a fine stamp on. My guess is that I, I mean, maybe, maybe let me ask it as a question. Is there ever an end to the amount of code that an an Organization might demand or could use? Basically, is there ever is there ever a point in which building is done, or is there always just in a world where it's 100 times easier to write code, we get 100 times as much code? I think we're in a world where it's 100 times easier, you get a thousand times more code. There there's an insatiable demand for software the way that we run our businesses today, like, people will laugh at, right? Like, very, very clunky CRM ERP systems, no digitization of the supply chain, like, these are very specific to each enterprise and the way that they run their business, and people will just start building all of this in-house, and then they're going to layer AI on top of it, then the technology is going to change again, so, like, it is it is an expansion opportunity for software now. AI will be writing most of of the software, right? Like, uh, eventually, you know, almost all of the software, and it's going to be directed by people who understand what these systems can do and how to operate and how to steer them. But there is not an Organization that is going to be deeply, deeply successful that doesn't build a lot more software.\n\nJavan's paradox in action. Uh, Javan's paradox is exactly that. Do you think that um, this vibe coding phenomenon of particular non non-engineers, non-coders being able to sort of interact in this language will have positive effects in terms of the ability of other parts of the enterprise Organization to communicate with people who are who are coding, who are sort of building products? If you think about code, building something visual, right? Like, it is a method not just to explain what you are thinking, but to explain it to yourself, right? And so vibe coding is a mechanism where you're having a two-way conversation and path to create a small application or a product that lets you tell a story about what you want to do. Often times, the value of people building these prototypes in house is, like, they realize themselves that your idea was not very valuable, right? Right. And so instead of just pitching this idea three or four or five or six times and, like, trying to convince your buddy from MIT to build it for you, like, you in in the course of a half an hour will decide that, like, your product idea for a note-taking app, like, was the same as Apple Notes, right? And so this is a net positive for the enterprise. Not just for the ability to say, \"Hey, I'm a non-technical person. I have an idea for a prototype for a marketing department, and I want to show it to you.\" But it's actually the ability to self-discover, like, what is valuable with a new tool to do so. But vibe coding, like, is is awesome for these nontechnical teams to prototype little projects, but you're seeing all these YC startups that, like, v-coded their way to their product, and then, like, it doesn't scale, right? Like, it's not a it's not a viable uh, engineering path. And so it's it's good for its purpose. It's good for small point applications, but, like, it should not be used to abstract to, like, how software can or should be built. I think wipe coding is here to stay, and we're, like, if if everything plays out the way the visionaries at Anthropic and OpenAI describe it, like, we're sprinting towards a world where wipe coding is what everyone does. We're all just wipe coders, but if you look at the reality as of today and the road to get there, wipe coding is definitely not the way. So there is definitely a place for, like, nontechnical people to wipe code applications into existence, get sign off, and then uh, sign the build to get it built a mix of the traditional way, but having said that, like I said earlier, there is a future where for a lot of applications, depending on the use case that makes sense, you can wipe code it perpetually, right? And you can keep it in production, but for a lot of other more complicated use cases, like, would you wipe code a healthcare application? No. Would you wipe code something that the government can use? Absolutely not. So there's always going to be things like next-level scientific breakthroughs that require more human involvement, and that will have to be built a combination of the traditional way. What's the blueprint for the modern agent-enabled software engineering department in terms of people, mindset, infrastructure, support, partners, vendors? What what are the pillars of a modern software engineering Organization? Yeah, we think about the AI native SDLC all the time. We consult on this directly with our partners, our customers, and help them answer this question. You need a batch development tool, something that operates at scale at context that does a lot of code. You need an IDE-based tool, right? Your winds surf, your cursor that is there in the developer workflow that they can work with. I would just say let the developers pick what they want. It's very, like, preferential at that point. And then that's I would say the minimum viable stack, which is we see like Blitzy.com plus cursor, blitz plus winds surf as a good minimum viable stack for the AI native SDLC. Uh, and then Figma is not going away, and so people that think, you know, Replit's going to replace Figma are sort of, they'll understand the nuances uh, required from a design department, but that is minimum, and you're going to see a lot of cool stuff coming out from Jira and a lot of these tools be able to work with Jira via MCP to make that existing kind of, like, call it non-AI native stack become AI native and work with these tools. So because of MCP, we're going to see a lot.\n\n\nOf these old common SAS providers be a part of the stack that is, uh, kind of like AI-native SDLC.\nAnd I think you mentioned also mindset and process.\nSo there's a couple of things I'd like to highlight there.\nI think from a mindset standpoint, you need to be able to trust the AI.\nYes, it's not going to be perfect in the short term.\nAnd, um, you need to be willing to change your day-to-day workflow from writing a lot of code to letting the AI write it, and you're reviewing and perfecting it and following all the regulatory practices, procedures, etc., approvals to get it into production.\nI think that's the biggest mindset shift that needs to happen.\nBut there's also another, um, specific procedural aspect that it gets talked about quite less, and that is the ability for AI agents to understand your codebase, and that's a continuous process.\nLike, for example, if you track the most elite users of Blitzy or any AI coding tool, what they're doing is they're creating documentation within the repository that AI agents can follow, right?\nAnd it's, and the fact of the matter is the fun part is that it's also useful for the humans.\nSo, for example, using Blitzy, you can document your entire codebase and ask it to create readme files in every single folder, or, uh, using cursor, you can create a plan, and then you can create that plan file at the root of your codebase and ask it to follow that plan, and, uh, you can also create coding guidelines and whatnot in this matter.\nBut the, the bottom line is if you're able to make it easier for the AI agents to follow your instructions and to understand your codebase, you're going to see massive dividends in code quality, right?\nBecause ultimately, if you think about current AI, it's garbage in, garbage out.\nSo, if you're able to increase the quality of what you put in, you're going to see much better quality of what comes out.\nAnd that it's, it's not linear, right?\nSo, even if you increase the quality by like 10 to 15% of specificity, for example, in what you tell it to do, you're going to see like an exponential increase.\nIt could be like 60% in terms of the output that you get back just because it's exactly what you expected it to do.\nBy way of starting to wrap up here, you mentioned MCP.\nAre there any trends, standards, conversations, new product developments, new advancements in models, anything that you're watching that has you particularly excited right now or that you're keeping a close eye on in the sort of broad domain?\nI would say that the biggest thing, you know, I've, I've been in this space since 2017, following along with deep learning with the generative adversarial networks ways.\nThe biggest problem then and even now to some extent was that it's a black box.\nNo one, even if they're a PhD in that very specific topic, no one really understands how the models actually work or, or, you know, how is it able to reason through.\nBut we're looking at things like, for example, we've, everyone's talking about MCP and A2A, but Anthropic recently put out this paper about circuit tracing, um, and they open sourced some libraries that are helpful for, and, and what that is essentially is you're able to visualize the neurons, right?\nSo the, the way neurologists explain how the brain works is like it's a set of neurons that fire, and by tracing the path of the neurons that fire, you're able to understand and diagnose like brain issues or how the brain works.\nIt's similar for models, though, like a lot of experts would tell you that that's no, that's the models are not like the brain, but if you stick to that analogy for a moment, if you're able to identify which parts of a neural network are being triggered, and if that was the expected path to be triggered based on your input prompt, you're able to understand if the model is doing what it is supposed to do, if it is looking at the right set of trained parameters in its, you know, set of parameters, and if it is on the right path.\nFor example, if it's a medical use case, and if you detect that the wrong set of neurons are being activated, you can intercept and stop that process, it could be a massive impact on the safety of that user, right?\nBecause it's hallucinating or it's not recommending something that's it's supposed to do, or there could be a security risk, right?\nSo this particular research and this article that Anthropic just put out, it is going to be gamechanging because you can now visualize the internals of the model, and it is going to significantly change the way models are built, and hopefully we're going to see much stronger open-source models separately because of this information.\nAnthropic is going to be, and others, right, are going to be able to convince enterprises that they're in control of the models, and they're give enterprises more confidence to adopt it just because they know that they have a stop button when you have a sign of something going wrong.\nBrian, you got anything?\nAnything you're watching?\nUh, I think people are dramatically underestimating the rate of computer use.\nSo, the ability to look at a screen and navigate it, which was really, really bad initially, uh, and people said like almost like wrote it off because it's not going to be interesting.\nBut if you talk about the ability to get software that's designed, built, then compiled, and then to make sure that it runs according to your spec, computer use is the fastest path to do that, right?\nAnd so all of these like really laborious, really distasteful, not enjoyable QA work is going to be offloaded onto that from a from a long inference time compute task effort to do end-to-end testing.\nAnd that is just another area where folks are spending time that they don't want to be spending time on when they could be elevated, abstracted away working on the most interesting, actually challenging problems for the enterprise.\nAwesome.\nWell guys, super interesting conversation.\nUh, like I said, this is a, a constant part of the discourse we have with companies at super intelligent, and one where again, I feel that we are, um, it is changing so rapidly and having such dramatically positive effects for companies that are sort of fully embracing this that, uh, I'm excited to see how it continues to develop.\nAwesome.\nThanks and all of you good hanging.\nThank for having us.\n",
