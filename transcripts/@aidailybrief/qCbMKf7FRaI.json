  "cleanText": "Welcome back to The AI Daily Brief.\nToday we are once again talking about Apple and its AI strategy, and for the first time in some time, some interesting indications that they may be looking to make some big moves.\nBy way of background, Apple had been conspicuously absent from the AI conversation since Chat GBT launched.\nWhile Microsoft was investing tens of billions into Open AI, and Google and Amazon were investing in rival Anthropic, as well as investing in their own models, Apple was sort of just sitting back on its heels, not quite sure what it wanted to do.\nNow, for a little while, this wasn't all that surprising.\nApple historically has not been the first mover.\nThey always try to be the best mover.\nThey try to innovate by skating to where the puck is going, but will often let people bumble around with half-formed experiences before they bring it all together and really get it right for consumers.\nAnd so when in 2024 at their Worldwide Developer Conference event, Apple announced their Apple intelligence platform, the way that they were describing it made a lot of sense.\nThis was basically going to be AI for normies.\nRather than selling a whole bunch of advanced features, it was really simple, clear integrations into daily life that Apple was betting would actually be useful for the average consumer who didn't care what AI stood for.\nThe problem was that none of it was really ready.\nThe features that were released were underwhelming, and many of the features that were promised were just never released.\nMost notably, Siri has not gotten anything resembling an upgrade, making it just embarrassingly far behind at this point.\nAnd while one might be tempted to say, does this even matter to Apple, or is this just the type of thing that all of us who are deep inside the AI space think about, it definitely matters to Apple?\nApple intelligence was a big part of the logic for getting people to upgrade their iPhones.\nAnd getting people to upgrade their iPhones is pretty much the way that Apple makes its money.\niPhone sales are by far its biggest source of revenue.\nAnd so if people decide that each incremental update is not enough to get a new phone or a new device, that actually hits their bottom line.\nNow, recently there have been indications that Apple is taking this seriously.\nThey've been moving executives around and it seems like trying to potentially rethink their strategy here.\nBut another WWDC came and went, and this time they basically self-consciously did not engage with AI almost at all.\nThere were no major AI announcements, nothing about a better Siri.\nThe only thing that AI folks were tracking that was somewhat exciting was Apple potentially opening some of their models to developers in a bid to get them to build more AI related things for iOS and Mac OS.\nAll of this has left the discourse for some time focused on what Apple can do to actually get back in this game.\nI did a show a few months ago, for example, called Six Hail Marys for Apple's AI comeback, and right at the top of my list was a big M&A move.\nSpecifically, I thought that they should buy Anthropic.\nAnd I am far from the only person to suggest this.\nOn May 22nd, Parker Orchilani tweeted, \"Fastest way for Apple to solve its problem is to buy Anthropic and let them rip.\nBut who knows how realistic that is.\nProbably not.\"\nNow, the tweet generated a lot of discussion, most of which was people articulating why Anthropic just wouldn't be interested.\nMost people pointed out that it doesn't seem like Anthropic has any real interest in that, even if theoretically Apple has enough money.\nBut that still hasn't stopped people from speculating.\nA couple weeks later, Josh wrote, \"Apple should just buy Anthropic.\nAnthropic is doing well in the developer market.\nTheir aesthetics are so good and they have pretty righteous ideals.\nApple could buy them in cash at par for their $61 billion valuation and still have hundred billion left.\"\nAgain, everyone popped in to say that Anthropic wouldn't be interested, blah blah blah blah blah.\nBut you get the idea.\nThis is where the state of the discourse has been.\nNow, interestingly, Apple has had some interaction with Anthropic.\nBack in May, Bloomberg's Apple Whisperer Mark German reported that they were teaming up to build something akin to a vibe coding platform.\nThe summary was this.\nApple is partnering with Anthropic to develop a new vibe coding software platform that uses AI to write, edit, and test code on behalf of programmers.\nThe system is a new version of Xcode, Apple's programming software that will integrate Anthropic's Claw Sonnet model, and Apple will roll out the software internally before deciding whether to launch it publicly.\nThe partnership reflects Apple's greater willingness to partner with others after struggling to develop homegrown technology, and the company is expected to add Google Gemini as an alternative to Chat GBT later this year.\nStill, it is a far cry from collaborating with someone on a next generation coding platform to actually acquiring them.\nAnd outside of the speculation of podcasters and Twitter denizens, there's been nothing to suggest that Apple was actually looking in that direction.\nAnd yet, we did get an interesting little nugget at the beginning of this month.\nThis report is from Dear Drabosa.\nIn a very rare disclosure during the Google Antitrust trial, one of them, Apple's Eddie Q revealed that the company had begun talks with Perplexity, saying they were impressed with the product and exploring integration.\nI spoke to Dimmitri Cheveno, that's a startup's business lead, and he told me that they were just as surprised to see Q go public because if there's one rule when dealing with Apple, it's this: you don't talk about doing business with Apple, yet here was Q breaking protocol and signaling serious interest.\nThat's a big deal.\nThere was clearly some interaction happening between Apple and Perplexity, although at the time it seemed like it was just about some sort of integration, although based on the reporting, it was a pretty serious integration.\nSome even suggested that they were looking to adopt Perplexity as an alternative to Google on the iPhone.\nSo, lots of people took notice, but mostly just went on with their lives until the very end of last week when Bloomberg published this piece.\nApple executives have held internal talks about buying AI startup Perplexity.\nOnce again, this comes from Mark German, who is the best sourced person inside Apple at this point of all the major media outlets.\nGerman writes, \"According to People with knowledge of the matter, Adrien Perka, the company's head of M&A, has weighed the idea with services chief Eddie Q, who you might remember from that Dear Drabosa clip as the one who was talking about Perplexity during the Google Antitrust trial, and other top AI decision makers.\nWhat would be included in this deal?\nWell, part of it looks to be indeed, as we discussed, a way to fill the gap of a potential breakup with Google.\"\nNow, at this stage, Apple's partnership with Google, which makes them the default browser on their devices, makes Apple about $20 billion a year, but could be cut off because of these antitrust cases.\nAnother reason to potentially bring in Perplexity is, of course, to get a big dose of AI talent.\nAs you're well aware at this point if you are a regular listener, the extreme length that big tech is going to to get premium AI talent has reached a new level with Mark Zuckerberg running around with hund00 million offers, completely resetting the compensation base for top engineers.\nNow, what's clear at this stage is that Apple is serious about a potential deal of some kind with Perplexity.\nApple's AI team has been actively evaluating Perplexity's tech, but at this stage, to the extent that the Apple executives have held internal conversations about an acquisition, they haven't apparently discussed it with Perplexity.\nSaid Perplexity, \"We have no knowledge of current or future M&A discussions involving Perplexity.\"\nIn fact, on Perplexity's side, it just raised another round at a 14 billion valuation.\nAnd it also appears to be very close to a large deal with Samsung as well.\nGiven that Samsung is basically Apple's biggest rival in the phone market, this could be something of a challenge for any sort of M&A.\nSo, what do people think about this deal?\nWell, after the reporting came out, German took some time to get editorial and wrote a piece called Apple will need to leave its M&A comfort zone to succeed in AI.\nGerman points out that whereas big acquisitions have long been a part of Google and Meta's playbook, think the massive WhatsApp acquisition or maybe the best acquisition of all time, Instagram in the case of Meta, and of course Google buying assets like YouTube.\nApple's biggest acquisition ever was only $3 billion, and that was for Beats back in 2014.\nIn fact, Apple has only made three M&A deals over a billion dollars in its entire history.\nAnd of the deals they've done, they haven't exactly gone well, or at least they haven't been easy.\nBecause of this, Apple's team is default skeptical of big M&A.\nAnd yet, as German points out, Apple is facing a very different set of circumstances these days and may have no choice but to do a deal.\nThe stakes of the AI race are just too high.\nHe goes on, developing the next generation of products, from glasses to robotics to new wearable devices, will hinge on AI.\nThe technology will be as foundational to those products as the multi-touch interface was to the iPhone, and that notably came via Apple's 2005 acquisition of Finger Works.\nApple's in-house AI work has floundered.\nSure, the company has its points.\nApple intelligence is smoothly integrated, and rivals don't protect privacy the way it does, but the truth is clear.\nApple has missed the AI moment, and it should accept that instead of making excuses.\nIf Apple had built something as groundbreaking as Chat GBT, it would be celebrating it from every rooftop.\nInstead, the company is downplaying the competition and branding its offering as AI for the rest of us because that's really all it can say.\nApple is doing its best with what it has and will continue to shrug off any concerns until it can offer something better.\nHowever, as German points out, the good thing is that Apple has more than $130 billion in cash.\nSo then with that huge stock, who could be the targets?\nOpen AAI is definitely out given that it's at a $300 billion valuation, to say nothing of its weird corporate structure that is a boondoggle with its existing relationship with Microsoft.\nAnthropic is valued at a range that theoretically they could afford, but given its relationships with Amazon and Google and just its general size, there's a concern that an Anthropic deal would bring serious regulatory scrutiny.\nAnd so that brings back to Perplexity.\nHe gives five reasons that he likes the deal.\nWhile the company doesn't have its own foundation models, what it does have is one, a proven consumer ready product.\nTwo, a clear need it fills in the context of Apple, i.e. a strong search layer and a conversational interface for everyday tasks.\nNumber three, a decent-sized team.\n250 employees with deep AI talent means it wouldn't be too big for Apple to integrate, but they'd get some real stars.\nA reasonable valuation considering what Apple has in the bank and good timing because of the potential of this forced breakup with Google search on the iPhone.\nOthers wrote about this as well.\nAlex Canowitz came out stronger with a post why Apple must buy Perplexity, a bonafide AI partner in a moment of need.\nIt's time for Tim Cook to make Apple's biggest acquisition in history.\nCanitz writes, \"Tim Cook ought to call Perplexity CEO Arvan Shinabas and offer him 30 billion for his AI search engine, and he should do it right away.\nApple buying Perplexity is such an obviously good deal for both companies that I feel silly even writing it down.\nApple would get a bonafide AI service it could plug right into Safari and Siri that would revamp its disappointing AI offering.\nPerplexity would get access to the 2 billion plus Apple devices in circulation and become an AI force on par with chatbt.\"\nWhen Cantouitz asked Perplexity Chief Business Officer Dmitri Chevaleno about a potential deal with Apple, he said not likely, but the meta scale deal is so unlikely that I feel like we aren't living in a world of likely.\nCanitz also points out that although the Samsung deal is emerging, that only puts a finer point on Apple's need to move quickly before it gets totally locked in.\nParker Ortillani, who we heard from earlier in the show, also wrote about this in a piece called The Curious Case of Apple and Perplexity.\nDo they need each other?\nParker says that when he read German's piece, his initial reaction was that wouldn't work.\nHe writes, \"The core reason that I thought Perplexity might not be a good fit was simple.\nThey may be culturally incompatible.\nBoth companies have very unique cultures.\nApple is much older, deeply set in its ways, led by a group of seasoned executives, and serves an audience so big that the stakes are astronomically higher.\nPower is concentrated to say the least, they also move, shall I say, more slowly.\nPerplexity, on the other hand, is nimble, fast-moving, extremely daring, and can be the young startup that can take the kind of risks that Apple can't.\nTo say that you can probably have a lot more fun working at Perplexity right now is likely an understatement.\"\nAnd yet, after he thought about it a little bit more, he started to see the logic.\nNow from Apple's side, like Caneritz, he finds it pretty obvious how Perplexity could slot in, especially in a world where Google search is forced off the iPhones by antitrust regulators.\nHe also points out that of course what Apple brings to Perplexity is just this massive set of larger users.\nHowever, he also makes the point that I think is a really salient one that Perplexity and Apple, while very different in terms of where they are in their life, might actually be too close.\nHe writes, \"At the end of the day, Apple needs a technology company, not another product company.\nPerplexity is really good at, for lack of a better word, forking models, but their true specialty is in making great products.\nThey're amazing at packaging this technology.\"\nThe reality is, though, that Apple already knows how to do that.\nOf course, only if they can get out of their own way.\nA company like Anthropic, a foundational AI lab that develops models from scratch, is what Apple could stand to benefit from.\nThat's something that doesn't just put them on equal footing with Google.\nIt's something that also puts them on equal footing with OpenAI, which is arguably the real threat.\nHe concludes, \"At the end of the day, I suppose that I've made the case both for acquiring Perplexity and against it.\nUltimately, either path is likely good for users, and I'll be happy no matter what happens.\nThe\n\n\nThe whole situation is great for Perplexity.\nIt helps further legitimize them.\nBut as a fervent observer, I keep coming back to the same two questions.\nIs Perplexity really what Apple needs?\nAnd is Perplexity better off without Apple?\n\nTo wrap up here, let's answer the second question first.\nIs Perplexity better off without Apple?\nOn the one hand, it is absolutely the case that unless Apple is extraordinarily hands off, which almost structurally they really can't be, Perplexity is going to be able to innovate faster without them.\nAt the same time, Perplexity has already done honestly majestic work to carve out as much mind and market share as they have given that their feature set is largely overlapping with core functionality of all the foundation models.\nChad GBT, Claude, and Gemini are all going to munch closer and closer to Perplexity's core business, and it is a very real possibility that they just get squeezed out.\nAn Apple deal which puts them directly on 2 billion devices is obviously very beneficial there.\nSo the trade-off is potentially ability to continue to innovate versus bull work against increased competition.\n\nWhen it comes to the question of is Perplexity really what Apple needs, I understand what Parker is arguing about them both being product DNA companies and Apple not having that technology DNA.\nHowever, for as much as Apple has historically been a product company, they have not done a good job of that when it comes to AI.\nTheir vision for how to think about AI is very tepidly something that seems compelling, but they haven't executed it at all in any meaningful way.\nAnd so I don't know how much we can actually argue that they're great product makers, at least in this new space.\nI think that the big question is if they did do an acquisition like this, how much they let Perplexity actually lead their product strategy versus just be something off to the side.\nThe team that's running the show at Apple at this point has shown themselves to be incapable of competing in the right way.\nIf an acquisition doesn't involve actual leadership integration, I don't know that I think it's going to work.\n\nStill, like Parker said, as a consumer, I don't think we can possibly lose in this.\nEither Perplexity gets the muscle to do even bigger and better things, or they get to stay independent and keep innovating incredibly fast.\nEither way, all of us win.\nStill a super interesting moment and a story that is worth following for sure.\nBut for now, that is going to do it for today's The AI Daily Brief.\nUntil next time, peace.\n",
