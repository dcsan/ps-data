  "cleanText": "Today on the *AI Daily Brief*, 15 ways I use AI and the models I use for each.\n\nThis week, we're doing something a little bit different for our long read/big ideas type of episode.\nI realized it's been a little while since I walked through some of my current AI workflows.\nI have found over and over again that one of, if not the single most useful way to help other people on their AI journey is just simply to describe what you're doing with AI, how you're doing it, and which specific tools or models you're actually using.\nSo, this is not a totally comprehensive list, but this represents a lot of the stuff that I do day in and day out.\nAnd first of all, I'm actually going to start with one that isn't me personally, but is at the core of super intelligence agent readiness audits.\nWe use a custom voice agent powered by the OpenAI API to help companies figure out what their most relevant agent use cases are.\nNow, voice agents are of course at the very beginning of their main streaming.\nAnd over time, we're going to see many different applications take advantage of this technology.\nBut I did want to call out since we're looking at both use cases and models that when it comes to understanding how people are working currently in order to give better advice about how they might use agents in their work, we are using the OpenAI API.\nNow, as part of the prep for this episode, I also asked Chad GBT itself to go back through what it knows about me based on its memory of its interactions with me to put together a list of 10 ways I use AI.\nIt came back with podcast production and distribution, strategic content creation, enterprise readiness audits, AI agent marketplace, high-end advisory and keynotes, children's storytelling and game design.\nYes, one of my ways to relax is custom Magic the Gathering sets.\nIt also called out market sizing and financial forecasting, marketing analytics and growth hacking, email and relationship management, and creative branding and naming.\nAlthough, interestingly, I will have something to say about naming at the end of this.\nIt was a fairly good list, but I want to be both more specific and more generic at the same time.\nAnd so, first of all, let's talk about editing the podcast.\nNow, I have at this point handed over the editing of this show entirely to my team, but we do everything in Descript.\nPart of the value of Descript, in addition to it being an inherently social and collaborative platform, is that in addition to its visual editing timeline, it also has an AI suite called Underlord.\nThere are lots of features in Underlord that are extremely useful if simple.\nRemoving all the filler words, a ums, likes, etc.\nRemoving retakes, basically where it can tell that you've done something twice and only uses the final and clearest one.\nOne that's really powerful is eye contact instead of using a teleprompter.\nYou can use this to basically automatically change your eyes to look as though you weren't reading.\nAnd they have a bunch of other features as well.\nNow, if you follow me on Twitter, you might have seen me lamenting the fact that on occasion, Descript will just up and drop an entire episode that I recorded.\nBut honestly, it's a testament to how good some of these editing features are that I put up with that happening every couple of months because the rest of the tools are so good, it's still worth the pain.\nOne other video editing tool that I did want to call out, however, is V.\nAnd believe it or not, and as testament to how single features can drive entire usage with V, you can edit and review not just at 1x, but at 2x or even 3x speed.\nWhen I am editing a podcast and just want to go very quickly, this is an absolute godsend and it's something that is not possible easily in tools like Adobe Audition.\nNow, one bonus for something that I should be using but that I'm not.\nAnd again, I will talk about this a little bit more towards the end.\nI really should be using one of the copious number of automatic clipping tools to be generating video clips that can turn into short form videos for places like Tik Tok, Instagram reels, and YouTube shorts.\nI don't do that currently, but I have taken some time to look across the various tools like Opus, and I do think that it's a use case that will enter into, if not my flow, maybe my team's flow at some point in the next 6 months or so.\nNow, staying on the podcast theme for a minute, another daily use is descriptions.\nIt is pretty much standard practice for me at this point to drop an entire transcript from an episode.\nBy the way, the transcript is autogenerated by description that ends up in the show notes.\nThis to me represents a perfect use of AI for writing in the sense that it's highly functional.\nIt's not about winning some prize for pros.\nI will say that I tend not to use the titles that they suggest.\nI found over and over again that chatbt has a way over adherence to conventions like putting colons or dashes into the middle of titles which just do not perform well in practice.\nIt's also kind of lazy.\nThe best titles are ones that find a way to be a single clear determined statement, not have multiple sections.\nNow, when it comes to this copywriting for podcast use case, I'm using either 40 or the 4.5 research preview.\nI don't find a huge difference between them for this particular use case.\nNow, what about when it comes to longer form writing?\nWell, first of all, I should note that in general, with one exception that I'll talk about in a minute, when I am doing longer form writing, it's with Claude, not with ChateBT.\nSpecifically now Opus 4.\nAlthough in general, this has been my pattern for some time and I've just used whatever the most advanced claude model is.\nNow, when it comes to posts that I'm writing for LinkedIn or just for a general audience where I'm trying to get my ideas out, I still do not use AI for those.\nBasically, the gist of it is at this stage if I'm posting on LinkedIn, it's because something is in my craw enough that I actually want to write it myself to get it out.\nBut there are certain types of writing that are more wrote, that are more for marketing purposes where I do integrate Claude.\nFor example, we've recently started to do an AI Enterprise weekly newsletter for companies, prospects, and partners that have engaged with the agent readiness audit.\nAnd for that, I basically drop in the transcript of each of the podcasts from the previous week.\nAnd I give it a very, very lightweight prompt.\nCraft a tight email summary of key news and stories in AI last week based on the attached transcripts.\nFocus on an enterprise audience.\nAnd then sometimes I give it a little bit more guidance based on the specific content of the week.\nSo, for example, for this most recent one, I wanted to really focus on a couple of reports that I had reported on rather than some of the more headline news.\nThere's a couple reasons why this works from an AI writing standpoint.\nThe first is it's appropriately aligned with the stakes of the writing.\nAgain, I'm not going for artistry here.\nI'm not going for even a highly viral LinkedIn post.\nI'm going for something competent, informative, and interesting for an email.\nAnd Claude is totally sufficient for that.\nSecond, because I am giving it hundreds of minutes of me talking, it's really already building off of the way that I talk and think in a way that it might not be if it didn't have all this context.\nThe other thing that's important to note about Claude, and another reason it tends to outperform when it comes to writing, is that you can create custom writing styles that you can come back to over and over again.\nThese are akin to something like a midjourney style template, but for writing instead of for images.\nSo, a couple that I've created include tech translator.\nThe style summary is deliver analytical insights through conversational and authoritative communication.\nThen I created one for my wife's podcast, which is a true crime show.\nThis one is called Cheeky Crime Companion.\nExplore dark topics through sophisticated, witty, and playful narrative commentary.\nBut I found that sometimes that one was a little too opinionated and a little too quirky for the subject matter.\nSo I also created Storyteller's Lens, which dials up the journalistic tone and down the playfulness without losing that playfulness entirely.\nAnd so over time, as you start to perfect these, they just become a really good shortcut that again gives Claude an edge when it comes to a lot of longer form writing.\nNow, speaking of my wife's podcast, while she writes her 2-hour weekly main episodes, literally long form by hand, which is absolutely insane, but here we are.\nWe do often do bonus posts, Patreon posts, things like that.\nSometimes I'll guest, sometimes it's her doing them for her audience.\nAnd this is another area where we'll turn to Claude for long form writing.\nAnd again, part of what makes it suitable for this use case is that by nature of her or Mai's presentation on that show.\nA lot of what matters about this scripting is the exposition, not the specifics and the personality.\nIn other words, this gives all of the details in a narrative sequence that makes sense, but she or I or whoever is presenting it is going to be able to fill in and give it personality by dent of actual presentation.\nNow one thing that I will note, and this sort of bridges both writing and starting to get into a new subject of research, is that there is exactly one situation in which I will sometimes turn to 03 as the writer instead of Claude or GPT40 or 45.\nIf I've started with a deep research background dossier, sometimes 03 will outperform from a writing standpoint.\nSo, in this case, this was a recent bonus episode that Jesse was doing for her show.\nIt was about one of the biggest thefts in British history, which turned out to be conducted by a group of retirees.\nI had Deep Research prepare a detailed background dossier which as you can see is dozens of pages long and then I asked it to turn that into a podcast script and having just done all of that background research it did a much better job of the writing than it would have in another context.\nNow research is obviously one of my most frequent use cases with Chad GBT's 03 version of deep research being my most general deep research tool.\nCouple other types of pretty frequent research use cases for me.\nOne is that I am always pitching something and so I am very frequently collaborating with 03 to figure out how to pitch or frame some sort of background thing and this is almost a hybrid of research and strategy.\nSo for example, recently I wrote come up with a strong argument for how much is going to be spent building AI agents over the next 5 years.\nAnd specifically what I was looking for is the fact that if you look at a lot of the estimates out there of agent economics, they're around total spend by organizations, but that's different than what they're going to spend specifically building them, which for a variety of reasons, which I will not get into right now, is of particular interest to me.\nAnd so as you can see, 03 spent about 2 minutes searching, researching, and thinking and combining that into a coherent answer.\nA variation on this is market research.\nRecently, for example, I asked for a comprehensive list of boutique strategy consulting firms, giving it the example of innocite as a comparison.\nThis was a search I did with deep research because I wanted a little bit of background dossier to ground myself in an area that I was exploring.\nInterestingly, although I tend to use OpenAI's version of deep research for deep research, when it comes to short sort of daily mini research, I find myself tending more towards perplexity.\nFor example, if I'm ever looking for random PE ratio research or something like that, I'm going to go to perplexity for that.\nNow, since I touched on strategy, let's move over to strategy.\nIf you listen to my episode about three things you can do to get better at AI right now, you will have heard that one of the things that I said was to treat 03 for one week as an actual strategic collaborator, not just as a tool.\nNow, I have a strong affinity for 03, but as we'll discuss, I think any of the state-of-the-art reasoning models are going to be useful in this context as well.\nSo, how do I actually use it as a strategic collaborator in this way?\nWell, basically at this point, I talk about pretty much every different strategic idea that I've had with 03 in some way, shape, or form.\nAnd that includes things that are both very, very core to the business, which I, for obvious reasons, can't show you right now.\nBut it's also sometimes about speculating around things that are for the moment just side quests.\nI was driving between where I live in the Hudson Valley and New York a week or two ago and I was randomly thinking about hypotheticals like if I didn't have Super Intelligent, how would I use the podcast to interact with startups in interesting ways?\nOne of the things that I find really useful about dumping that into a platform like 03, even though there's no real intent behind it, is that if you're anything like me, you can get that prickle of an idea or an intent and really get down a rabbit hole before you rip yourself back out and focus on the here and now.\nI find that dumping that all into 03, talking about it a little bit, honestly, in most cases, just makes it easier for me to leave it behind and focus at the real important stuff that's right in front of me.\nAlthough, of course, if some of those ideas stick, it'll be because there's something there.\nAnd having 03 or another reasoning model as a strategic collaborator can be a good way to figure that out.\nIn addition to just new ideiation, there's also current strategic decision-making.\nAnd I only wanted to flag that while I haven't fully integrated it yet, I am at least for the moment giving Gro 4 a try as a competitor in this role for at least a week or two.\nI did a few tests in the first couple of days after it came out and was sufficiently impressed that I thought it was worth taking the time to parallel process and see how it does as compared to 03.\nNow, speaking of pitch, one particular area of strategy/writing/information design that the reasoning models are incredibly good at is stuff around pitch.\nSo, the way that I tend to use this is not for final products or final copy or anything like that, but it's to tighten explanations to go from ramble or brief outline to more robust outlines and memos.\nI will note that it has a little bit of an easier time with memos as opposed to decks.\nI think pitch decks in terms of the training set are a bit too formulaic as compared to the pitch decks that actually work in practice.\nSo, it has a bit of a harder time there.\nBut the reasoning models are really good at information architecture and I'm pretty sure that you will get value if you use them as a collaborator when it comes to pitching whatever it is you're pitching.\nNow one very strong note\n\n\nI have if that is a particular use case that you are using these tools for, you have to assume some level of sycophancy is going to be the norm on your first attempt.\nSo, for example, I recently asked 03 to help improve a deck outline.\nAnd improving it, quote unquote, at first just meant doing a slightly more expansive of exactly the sequence of information that I had given it.\nThat led me to say something to the effect of, now use your own prerogative and don't assume that the way I've architected this pitch is just right and come back and tell me how you would change it.\nAnd invariably, that's where you actually get the better support for this particular type of use.\nNow, one thing that I did want to note because I mentioned rambling.\nIf you use an iPhone or an Apple product, you'll know just how unfathomably offensively bad its voice recognition software is at this point.\nChatGBT is really good, but for more general use, many, many people are now using Flow or Whisper.\nFlow W I SP RF L.AI.\nI've installed it and I use it in every app that it's available, which is pretty much across the entire iPhone, and it is a total game changer and I could not recommend it more.\nNow, what about moving outside of LLMs?\nI've mostly focused on Word Cell types of tasks because that's a lot of where my day in and day out is.\nBut what about some of the image generation stuff?\nWell, let me tell you about two different use cases there.\nWhen it comes to collateral and assets, so things like covers and episode art, Audiogram is my tool of choice.\nIt has one high understanding and high fidelity to what you're actually trying to accomplish, which is really important when you're trying to present information in a certain way.\nTwo, it's great with text, which again, if you're doing cover art for a podcast episode, is incredibly important.\nAnd three, it basically does the heavy lifting of prompting for you.\nSo, for example, my prompt for this one was retrofuturistic 1980s glitchy red computers arcade scene cyberpunk title, how AI companies are using AI.\nIt turned that into a retrofuturistic digital art piece depicting a 1980s arcade scene overtaken by glitch effects.\nThe central focus is a row of vintage red CRT computers displaying distorted interfaces with how AI companies are using AI prominently displayed on the larger screen in a neon green pixelated font.\nStatic and digital noise blah blah blah blah blah.\nYou get the idea.\nIt's about five times as long as my original prompt.\nAnd because it exposes it, it gives you the ability to go back and edit it and remix it.\nSo if you like some parts of it but not others, you can generally get it to a place where you want it to be.\nStill there are other use cases that I have for image generation where I still am on Midjourney.\nAnd that's basically anything where I either want just real deep interesting creativity.\nFor example, you can see I'm doing some artistic experiments here for a project where I was trying to combine Renaissance Vuvian manstyle Leonardo da Vinci notebook art with modern technology.\nBut then another time that I tend to turn to my journey is if I'm just generating cool backgrounds for say presentations.\nI recently did a keynote that had like 150 slides and had a bunch of different sort of semi-abstract styles.\nHonestly, when it comes to sheer fun, I still love MidJourney.\nIt consistently produces just the most interesting and visually arresting things.\nAlthough sometimes interesting and visually arresting isn't just accomplishing what you want, which is why I think it's great to have so many of these different models at your fingertips.\nAnother pretty frequent AI use case for me is vibe coding specifically as a way to explore new feature ideas for super intelligent.\nAt this point, we have a soft ban on describing new feature ideas.\nYou just have to vibe code it up.\nWe found that one, it gives the person who's coming up with that feature idea a much better ability to actually refine it and decide if they actually really like it before they share it with everyone else.\nAnd two, when they do share it with everyone else, it's way easier for them to just show rather than tell.\nNow, one thing that I did want to flag that I think LLMs are phenomenally bad at is naming.\nMaybe it's because people are terrible at naming things as well, but good lord are LLMs just absolutely phenomenally, almost hilariously bad at naming things.\nThey're either too cringey or too long or too long and too cringey.\nI have never had an LLM come up with a name for anything, side project, feature idea, anything that I actually thought was even remotely usable.\nSo, I don't know if that will ever be a real use case, but I wanted to call it out, especially because chatbt noted that this was a frequent use case for me.\nAnd it's only frequent because of how bad it is.\nAnd I keep trying just to see if it will continue to stay that bad forever.\nNow, I also wanted to share one area where I think I am behind again from that three things you can do to be ahead episode.\nWhile I have spent a bunch of time experimenting with and playing around with automations from platforms like Lindy and Nad and Zapier, I do not currently have a set of automations in deployment.\nAnd that's absolutely stupid.\nYou have my full permission to come absolutely castigate me if in 6 months I don't have some automated or agentic setup that takes my published content, turns it into short form videos, pumps it out across all the social channels in a way that is again completely automated and agentic and out of my hands.\nIt's so obvious that this is something I need to be doing, but is a great reminder, I think, that even for someone who spends all their time on this, there is a hurdle and a barrier to getting things up and running and a real new systems thinking that's required that's going to run up against inertia and just normal human time pressure.\nBut I wanted to plant that flag.\nIt is an area where the capabilities have outstripped what I'm using them for, and that is to my and the audience's detriment.\nThe one other note that I wanted to flag, ever since 03 came out, I have been very very adherent to OpenAI.\nBut I will note that Gemini just keeps getting better.\nThe models are improving, the interfaces are improving, the tools like AI Studio are improving.\nI'm finding myself because I use Google Workspace like Docs and Sheets for all my nonAI stuff more frequently experimenting with and testing the integrated features that Google puts across those tools.\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised again if you dip in in 6 or 12 months to see that my general Gemini usage had gone up significantly.\nFor now though, that's the current status.\nCertainly when it comes to video, if I ever do have uses, V3 is the model that I'm using.\nBut it'll be interesting to see in a few months where the balance of usage is between Gemini Groclaude and OpenAI.\nSo friends, those are 15ish, maybe more, I don't think less, ways that I use AI, the models that I use for each, and even some areas where I think I should be using AI more.\nHopefully, this was a helpful little journey, and I'm interested to see if any of these mirror or match the way that you guys are using these tools.\nFor now, though, that is going to do it for today's AI Daily Brief.\nUntil next time, peace.\n",
