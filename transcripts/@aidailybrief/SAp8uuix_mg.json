  "cleanText": "Welcome back to The AI Daily Brief headlines edition.\nAll the daily AI news you need in around 5 minutes.\nThere apparently is no one good and technical in AI that Mark Zuckerberg has not tried to buy.\nThe latest news is a rumored acquisition of Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross's investment fund.\nThe information reports that talks are underway to partially buy out the fund, which has just an absolute murderer's row of investments.\nThese guys are some of the absolute most prolific investors in all of AI and were early in Perplexity, 11 Labs, as well as Ilia Sutskever's Safe Super Intelligence.\nIt's not exactly clear how much of the fund would be bought out versus just them coming.\nBut whatever combination it is, it looks like the price tag would be over a billion dollars.\nNow, just like in previous cases, there is clearly a big focus on the people here themselves.\nIf the deal goes through, both partners would join Meta to work under Alexander Wang in this new star-studded super intelligence division.\nPrior to forming the fund, Gross led machine learning efforts at Apple, including as part of the early development of Siri.\nThe product was based on technology that Apple acquired from his startup Q.\nAs well as investing in Safe Super Intelligence, Gross is also listed as a co-founder alongside Suskever and serves as the company's CEO.\nNat Friedman is a serial founder who made his way to Microsoft in 2016 via acquisition.\nIn 2018, when he was a vice president at the company, he was appointed CEO of the newly acquired GitHub.\nHe parted ways with Microsoft in 2021 to focus on venture investing.\nAnd apparently Friedman has been involved with Meta's AI efforts for a little while now.\nThe information writes in May 2024, Friedman joined an advisory group to consult with Meta's leaders about the company's AI technology and products.\nEarlier this year, Zuckerberg asked Friedman to lead Meta's AI efforts altogether.\nFriedman declined but helped brainstorm other candidates including Wang.\nAnd apparently Zuckerberg had been skeptical that Alexander Wang would leave Scale, but it was Friedman who convinced him that a deal was possible.\nNow, frankly, the numbers are not adding up here for me.\nFriedman and Gross's investments are incredibly valuable.\nAnd it seems like sources say that Zuckerberg doesn't really care about the assets and is just looking to acquire the talent.\nBut in addition to that, Safe Super Intelligence just raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation just a few months ago.\nNow, you have to think that that is largely based on Ilia's reputation, but still you also have to think that Gross leaving for Meta would materially impact those investments.\nInterestingly, and this gets back to Zuckerberg trying to buy everyone, apparently he also tried to buy Safe Super Intelligence earlier in the year as well.\nThe sourcing is very light on that particular deal, just saying that Ilia rebuffed Zuckerberg's attempt, but we don't even really have the exact timing.\nOmar Kanji of Dragonfly Capital wrote that the deal would be a big one.\nHe writes, \"If Zuck and Meta acquire Nat Freeman and Daniel Gross's venture fund, it would be mind-boggling.\nThrough the fund or stake, he'd get a piece of Safe Super Intelligence and household names like Perplexity, Character.ai, 11 Labs, and more.\nIt also gives him world-class talent that are founder employee magnets to build up Meta AI, a tow hold with some of the most promising next-gen companies whom he can acquire or partner with, a range of seed bets, runway to a vertical stack, and info rights across the landscape.\nmixes strategic investment and brand building and business development and talent acquisition and strategy all into one deal.\nNow, one more piece of news on Zuckerberg's acquisition efforts.\nOver the weekend, The Verge reported that he had also made offers to buy Perplexity and Mirror Morott's thinking machines as well.\nWriting in the Command Line newsletter, Alex Heath commented, \"At this point, it's becoming easier to say which AI startups Mark Zuckerberg hasn't looked at acquiring.\"\nSpeaking of Mirror Morati, the former CTO of OpenAI has apparently closed $2 billion in funding at a $10 billion valuation.\nThis is one of the largest early stage funding deals in venture history.\nThe 6-month-old startup is still pre-product and hasn't even made it clear what they're working on.\nBuo Capital was one of about a billion tweets like this one.\nI need $2 billion.\nNo, you may not know about the product.\nNo, I will not share anything about the financials.\nNo, your voting rights won't matter.\nYou have 24 hours.\nHe shared a pull quote from that Financial Times piece that reads, \"Because of its highly clandestine nature, a number of funds that Marotti pitched to passed on the deal.\nOne of those people added Marott's pitch offered no information about a product or financial plans.\nSo, what does she have?\nWell, of course, the answer is talent.\nThey now have a roster of more than 30 leading researchers drawn from the big AI labs, which at Zuckerberg's $und00 million ahead offer is at least three billion worth right there.\nRight.\nReporting states that Andre Horowitz led the round with participation from Sarah Go's conviction partners.\nIt confirmed that Marotti will hold majority voting rights, ensuring she retains complete control over decision-making at the company.\nLastly, speaking of Open AI, there was quite a bit of halalu over the weekend when people started to notice that all of the information around their deal with Johnny IV had suddenly been scrubbed from the website.\nPeople ran to speculate that somehow the bromance between Johnny and Sam Alman had come apart, but it turns out it has to do with a lawsuit.\nOpenAI later clarified, writing that this page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint about our use of the name IO.\nWe don't agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.\nBloomberg's Mark German writes, \"The Johnny Ivan OpenAI deal is on
