  "cleanText": "Welcome back to The AI Daily Brief headlines edition.\nAll the daily AI news you need in around 5 minutes.\nThings are getting a little feisty in AI land.\nWe're seeing more and more aggressive competition when it comes to data and even some companies that were previously partners kind of starting to be at loggerheads with one another.\nIn particular, tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft are flaring up as OpenAI's for-profit conversion stalls out.\nLast month, you'll remember that OpenAI abandoned plans to ditch their nonprofit structure, but remain committed to converting to a public benefit company.\nThe conversion would still unlock normal corporate structure with regular equity shares in a path to going public.\nMicrosoft were reportedly the only ones on the cap table in opposition to the conversion given their lucrative revenue and profit sharing agreement.\nMicrosoft is currently entitled to a 20% share of revenues and a 49% share of profits.\nIt's all very speculative, but the deal is capped out at around 120 billion.\nNegotiations have been ongoing since October when the conversion was first contemplated, but the Wall Street Journal reports that they've become more difficult in recent weeks.\nThe Journal writes, \"OpenAI's executives have discussed what they view as a nuclear option, accusing Microsoft of anti-competitive behavior during their partnership.\nNow, that would involve seeking a federal regulatory review of the investment contract for antitrust violations.\nOpenAI is also considering a PR campaign to turn public opinion against Microsoft.\"\nIssuing a joint statement, however, the two companies wrote, \"We have a long-term productive partnership that has delivered amazing AI tools for everyone.\nTalks are ongoing and we are optimistic that we will continue to build together for years to come.\"\nSources also told the journal that the Windsurf acquisition was part of the problem.\nCurrently, Microsoft has full access to all of OpenAI's IP, including models and systems.\nBut OpenAI doesn't want Microsoft to gain access to Windsurf technology, which would make GitHub copilot more competitive as an AI coding product.\nA Windsor spokesperson said that the acquisition was quote unquote speculative, suggesting the deal is still in limbo while the dispute is ongoing.\nThe rest of the negotiations are about how many shares Microsoft will get post conversion, as well as OpenAI wanting to be released from exclusivity agreements.\nThe information reports that OpenAI is offering Microsoft a 33% stake in the restructured company, which is a huge haircut from the 49% profit sharing agreement.\nRegarding the exclusivity agreement, the information writes, \"OpenAI has told investors it wants to get out of its exclusive cloud contract with Microsoft, which makes Microsoft the only cloud provider that offers OpenAI models for sale through an API.\"\nMicrosoft rivals Amazon and Google could jump at the chance to host OpenAI models on their servers, which would make it easier for their cloud customers to use them.\nThey also note that Google has already lobbyed the government to kill the exclusive deal.\nMicrosoft is also seeking to access OpenAI's technology past the current end date of 2030 with an ongoing debate about the definition of AGI.\nAnd lurking behind all of this is that OpenAI faces an end of year deadline to complete its restructuring or to potentially lose out on at least 20 billion in committed fundraising.\nI would characterize the community's response to this as not all that surprised.\nMatthew Burman writes, \"No one could have seen this coming.\nIt's kind of like the Thusidities trap.\nEventually, Microsoft and OpenAI will go to war.\nSam Alman has ambitions far greater than being the model provider powering Microsoft Copilot.\nHe wants OpenAI to be Microsoft, Apple, and Google all rolled into one.\nBe interesting to see how this plays out.\nNow, in another area of competition around all of these big labs, Google is cutting ties with Scale AI following their deal with Meta.\nCiting five sources, Reuters reports that Google is ending their relationship with Scale after Meta acquired them.\nGoogle had been Scale AI's number one customer and was planning to spend about 200 million this year on data labeling.\nReuter sources added that Microsoft and XAI were also planning to end their contracts.\nReportedly, Scale brought in 870 million in revenue last year with 150 million of it coming from Google.\nA Scale spokesperson declined to comment on the Google relationship, but insisted the company's business remains strong.\nThey added that the startup will continue to operate independently and safeguard customers data.\nFor competitors, this is a big opportunity.\nLabelbox CEO Manu Chararma said that they would generate hundreds of millions of new revenue from customers fleeing scale.\nGarrett Lord, the CEO of Handshake, said, \"Our demand has tripled overnight after the news.\"\nFor some, this opens the question of what exactly Meta just paid $15 billion for.\nSignal writes, \"Meta paying 15 billion for 49% implies around a $30 billion post money valuation.\nBut that price was set before the recent exodus, OpenAI, Google, possibly others shifting to in-house infrastructure or rivals.\nIf those departures create a revenue tied to that 51%, then the implied valuation from the meta deal is massively distorted post facto.\nZuck basically ends up with a business where 15 billion got you an entire company without actually buying the whole company.\nNow, if you think that that means that it's increasingly looking like most of the value of the deal seems to be about bringing CEO Alexander Wang and key members of his team in house, you are not alone in that feeling.\nIndeed, details are emerging from inside the massive deal, explaining exactly how this whole thing went down.\nThe information reports that the deal started with Mark Zuckerberg floating a relatively modest or at least comparably modest $5 billion investment into scale back in mid-April.\nEven at that early stage, he was primarily negotiating to secure CEO Alexander Wang as the leader of his super intelligence team rather than the company itself.\nWang countered with 20 billion, arguing that existing shareholders wouldn't go for a smaller investment that risked destroying value in the company as customers fled.\nThe pair eventually met at 14.3 billion for just under half of the company.\nThe report states this ultimately represents a $12.8 billion windfall for existing stockholders via a dividend paid for by Meta's investment.\nThat includes over a billion for Wang himself, according to sources close to the company.\nThey said the payout will vest over 5 years as long as Wang remains employed at Meta.\nAnd there have also been discussions of Wang taking on the title of chief AI officer.\nThe information writes, \"Zuckerberg's deputies were concerned that Meta was paying a lot to be a minority shareholder with few rights in a startup that was losing its founder.\nThe startup had also recently failed to meet its own financial projections.\nBehind the scenes, they worked to shift the deal more in Meta's favor.\nThey report that if scale sells within the next 2 and 1/2 years, Meta will get fully paid back before other investors see a dime.\nThe article also suggests that Meta is walking a tight rope between financial, regulatory, and strategic concerns.\nIt all seems pretty clear based on all the reporting so far that what Zuckerberg cares about is getting back in the AI race, and he believes very strongly that Wang is the person to lead that effort.\nThis is a fascinating report with just a ton of hard ball on how the deal came together.\nAt one stage, Meta asked for full voting rights.\nAside from the appointment of board members, Meta also asked for a poison pill that would inflate their control if Alexander Wang was found to be helping to run Scale while working at Meta.\nBasically, the overall tenor of all of this is that both sides knew the deal risked destroying value at the startup and needed some form of protection.\nThrough their liquidation preference, Meta secured a return on their investment if Scala is sold off.\nFor existing investors and staff, the protection was a lucrative payout.\nNow rather than risking the company falling off.\nThis deal it feels is going to be very binary.\nEither it's going to make Zuckerberg look like a genius or an absolutely insane person.\nAnd only time is going to tell which.\nFor now though, that is going to do it for today's AI Daily Brief headlines.\nNext up, the main\n",
