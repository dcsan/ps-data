  "cleanText": "Welcome back to the AI Daily Brief.\n\nToday we are talking about the Acquihires of Windsurf by Google. And while at first glance this might strike you as a sort of insidery baseball story, right? Something that is about the machinations of Silicon Valley and how these sort of deals come together. This is the type of insider baseball story that has incredibly long tale of implications. Part of the story tells us where we are in the realm of vibe coding and agentic coding more broadly. There may be implications for OpenAI and specifically OpenAI's deal with Microsoft. More broadly, however, this is part of a trend that is upending the very fabric of how startups work in ways that very honestly could make employees think twice about working for young companies. So, let's talk about Windsurf, what they are, what happened, how it all went down, and try to understand what it all means for all of us. Now, for those who are not familiar, Windsurf is one of the leaders of the vibe coding/AI coding assistance that quickly became the hottest sector in AI this year. If you have Bolt and lovable on one end of the spectrum and cursor on the other, this is certainly closer to the cursor end of the market. Being an AI coding assistant and IDE for knowledgeable programmers rather than a vibe coding product for normies and non-technical people who can now speak and code. At the same time, the line between these two ends of the spectrum is getting a lot blurriier. And what's important to understand is that every major AI lab feels very strongly that they need to stand up their own AI coding platform as a matter of urgency. Now, that appeared to be the logic when news broke that OpenAI had agreed to buy Windsurf for $3B back in May. OpenAI did release their own coding tool called Codex a week later, but acquiring an established product alongside with its user base and talent obviously has a lot more velocity. AI coding is absolutely the biggest land grab for an AI use case since chatbots post chat GBT. Now, it was very clear that OpenAI had put priority in this area before settling on the Windsurf deal. They had apparently tried to acquire Cursor as well. Now, in advance of the acquisition, it's not exactly clear how strong a position Windsurf was in. On the one hand, they had reportedly grown to 100 million ARR, but there were also reports that they were trying to raise another round at a $3B valuation. And the reality is is that even an extremely well- capitalized company in this space was going to just be a sales from all sides. You've got bottoms up insurgencies from the vibe coding platforms. You've got all the other agentic ideides coming at you. And then of course you have all the hyperscalers and foundation model companies themselves who are in a very sort of friendnemy relationship with all these platforms in that their models power them but they also want to own those customers directly. Whatever the case, the option of going it alone got a lot harder in early June when Anthropic cut Windsurf off from direct access to Claude models. Now, this seemed to be in direct response to the news of OpenAI's acquisition, said Anthropic co-founder and chief science officer Jared Kaplan. We're really just trying to enable our customers who are going to sustainably be working with us in the future. I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.\n\nAnd while Windsurf was able to figure out how to get access for its customers to cla via third parties, this almost certainly put cost and operational pressure on the startup. As time dragged on, more and more people noticed that we just hadn't really heard anything about the acquisition since that first wave of rumors. That was until the middle of June when we started to get reporting that the Windsurf deal had become a major sticking point in OpenAI's negotiations with Microsoft. The tech giant holds the deciding vote on whether OpenAI can convert into a for-profit public benefit company. They reportedly want to retain the right to access all of OpenAI's IP, arguing that that should extend to Windsurf if they were acquired. Indeed, the dynamic is such a significant part of the story that many outlets are taking the view that Microsoft effectively killed the OpenAI Windsurf deal. For their part, Windsurf were themselves also uncomfortable with giving Microsoft full access. And indeed, in retrospect, last week's announcement that Microsoft had partnered with Replet on an integrated vibe coding service was a pretty big sign that the deal was heading south. Now, technically the catalyst for this all falling apart was an exclusivity window around the OpenAI deal expiring, which allowed Google to swoop in. The terms of the new deal are that Google is hiring Windsorf CEO Varon Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and some of Winsurf's R&D employees. They'll pay $2.4 billion to license Winds IP, but won't make a formal investment in the company. In other words, this is very clearly another wonkily structured Acquihires deal that circumvents or is at least meant to circumvent antitrust regulations. Google's new employees can start immediately and Windsurf will continue to operate as an independent company. All of which sounds fine theoretically, if weird, right? Maybe there's a question around whether this actually passes regulatory scrutiny, but whatever. If it works, it works. Except for the fact that there are a whole slew of employees who are not moving over and who it's not clear are actually going to get the benefits of any of their hard work over the past few years. Natasha Moscaranas from the information writes employees with vested shares will receive cash. Employees who joined less than 12 months ago are not vested and won't get payouts under the current terms. Windserve negotiated to keep 100 million on its balance sheet. Company will shift focus to enterprise customers. Remaining company will now be employeeowned. Now, the real sticking point is how the deal impacts employees. Entrepreneur Dave Pack wrote, \"A few weeks ago, I was thrilled for a buddy at Windsurf when the OpenAI acquisition was announced. I joked in our group chat that he'd be picking up the tab on the next boys trip. Now, with Google's AcquiHire, the news is devastating. Here's what I've gathered. The top 30 AI engineers and leadership are going to Google. Existing employees are getting nothing. Even early team members with significant vested equity are reportedly receiving peanuts. I was DM'd by several who asked to remain anonymous. The company still has a massive cash balance, but is gutted. Now, Dave goes on to explain why this is such a problem. Early startup employees are the people who take real risks, leaving stable jobs, accepting lower salaries, buying into the dream that equity might someday mean something. They work more hours, they take on more stress, and yes, they sign up for the possibility of a big win. When that big win actually happens and people get cut out, it breaks trust in the whole system. A $3 billion plus exit is the dream scenario. This is when things go right. Calling it an AcquiHire to dodge regulatory scrutiny while stiffing your team is just greed disguised as compliance. As a founder, this will hurt us dramatically. Hiring was already getting harder. Post Zerp, the salary gap between startups and big tech did shrink. However, overfunded startups made employees skeptical of equity. I hear more and more early employees negotiating for less equity in favor of cash. And I've experienced that myself. They think it's just a nice bonus if things work out and have been trained to think it's worth $0. I don't know the solution here, but there is a ton of money to play with on a $3 billion exit. Even a 250k to 500k bridge for every employee would make a massive difference. There's enough to do that and more. If you're a founder or a VC, this is your wakeup call. If this becomes the norm, startups will be staffed by mercenaries, not missionaries. Equity will mean nothing. The model breaks. Stop being a short-term thinker and squeezing every last dollar out of this deal. And this really was the tone all around the internet on this. Jordy Hayes of TBPN seemed to confirm what David had been writing about. He said, \"The founders and dozens of engineers are going to Google. This group along with the preferred shareholders will be sharing the $2.4 billion headline number. The exact split is unknown, but investors are making some money on the deal and the founders plus the select group are making a ton. That brings us to the hundreds of employees that aren't going to Google. From what I've heard, they're all getting screwed regardless of their vesting status. The consolation prize is they now own 100% of the original company. Windsurf's leadership is making the argument that this is a win for those that aren't joining Google. Their claim is that Windinsserve still has a meaningful amount of revenue and a solid balance sheet. But Windsurf will now be facing intense competition from not only its former founders and engineers who are now at Google, but every other company in codegen that they were already competing with/ losing to cursor anthropic etc. Given that Google now has a license to the core technology, it's safe to assume that Windinsurf will struggle and on a longer time horizon will be a zero. Jordy continues, the structure appears to be very similar to Google's deal with character AI. Google effectively acquired Nome Shazir and left character AI employeeowned. The difference there is that Google had no desire to compete in AI companionship. They just wanted a Gnome and some key people. Windsurf is left in a much worse position. My read is that the Windsurf leadership team was desperate to find a way out and facing competition from the labs and cursor structured a deal to benefit themselves. Why they thought they could structure a deal like this and get away with it is anyone's guess. At this point, I imagine all the parties involved are scrambling to try to find a resolution because if things stay as they are, it will be a massive stain on the industry. Now, if that represented the common sentiment, there were some who pleaded for caution. Jord's co-founder and co-host at TBPN, John Kugan, wrote, \"My steelman here is that one, employees who haven't reached a one-year vesting cliff don't have that strong a claim around I built this with sweat and need a liquidity event, and we don't know the tenures of all left behind employees. Two, the real culprit here might be FTC antirust. This is a hyper competitive market and Google still feels like they can't just do a normal acquisition. Three, new facts might come out. Now, the vesting cliff that he's talking about for those of you who don't work in startups is that usually when you are at a startup, the standard sort of arrangement with your equity is that it is distributed over a 4-year vesting period. That means that you don't just get whatever percentage of the company you're going to own or whatever set of stock options you're going to own all at once. You're incentivized to stay there for a period of time. The one-year cliff is the standard term at which any of your equity is realized. So, if you only stick around for seven or eight months, you don't get anything. What Kugan here is saying is that it could be that a lot of those employees that were quote unquote left behind are people who have only been there for 6 or 7 months, which while yes, they did work hard, maybe doesn't entitle them to that much of this exit. Now, there's tons of debates to be had there. I've been fortunate enough to be in positions where CEOs have had some version of partially or fully accelerated investing as part of an exit like this. So, it's not like they're locked into doing nothing even if they haven't hit their cliff. But John is pointing out that the brutality of this may be a little bit different if we dig into the details. Now, Jordy did later update and say updated belief is that this was almost entirely a comm's problem. I.e. Google made founder to team messaging difficult and the team left behind will get a fair outcome in the end after distributions.\n\nAlex Cohen gave a version of that saying, \"If I was one of the employees stuck holding the bag at Windsurf, I'd simply vote to shut down the Shell Company and pay the remaining 200 of us 500k each off the balance sheet. Modern problems require modern solutions.\" Now, clearly this is part of a larger trend like Scale AI's 49% stake sold to Meta that really seemed to be all about getting CEO Alexander Wang to lead their super intelligence team. the Google character AI deal that we talked about which was 2.7 billion for a couple of founders and 30 staff. Then there was the inflection deal where Microsoft spent 650 million to hire CEO Mustafa Sllyman and licensed the models while leaving inflection nominally independent and Amazon's Acqui hiring of adept and coariant also follows this model. I think it's fair to say that these deals have not left the remaining company in a particularly strong position. Character AI may be the best positioned to them, but they've still struggled to make a lot of advancements or access additional funding. On the other end of the spectrum, it's been widely reported that scale AI is bleeding customers and might not be able to compete post the meta deal. I would say at this point, most people's bet is that Windinsurf follows the negative model. Galia Ros writes, \"Sucks for anyone who joined Windsurf in the last 12 months. Also, we can say that Windinsurf as a company and product is 99% dead in 12 months. Enterprise customers should move off ASAP. this company will likely go bankrupt in that much time because it'll be hard and possible to raise more funding. And part of the issue in this area specifically is the growing recognition that in the coding space there's very little moat. Netflix engineer Jake writes, \"Winsurf is absolutely dead in the water and while cursor hangs on for now, all value is going back to the models.\" He shared a post from Hacker News that wrote, \"In my opinion, other than the Microsoft IP issue, I think the biggest thing that has shifted since this acquisition was first in the works is Claude code has absolutely exploded. forking an IDE and all the expense that comes with that feels like a waste of effort considering the number of free and open source CLI agentic tools that are out there. Now, what he's referring to is this sort of frenemies dynamic that I was articulating before where all of these models are powered by Claude, but Claude is still very much competing for those end customers as well. Zooming out just beyond the implications for Agentic Coding, it really appears that this is a new profile of acquisition. Billy itchf of category VC calls it the Blitz hire acquisition and believes we're going to see a lot more of these deals. To get specific, in a normal acquisition, either the entire company is bought out or the employees and IP are acquired,\n\n\nLeading the company to be shut down.\nThese new blitz hires leave a shell company behind that may or may not continue.\nMany investors laid the blame for this at the former FTC chair, Lena Khan, and her aggressive pursuit of antitrust enforcement during the last administration.\nMartin Casado of Andre Horowitz posted, \"There's an irony that Lena Khan's activism has resulted in deals that are far worse for everyone except the people she was targeting.\nStill, Villia thinks that these blitz hire acquisitions would have happened anyway due to the pace of AI advancement.\nIf Google had done the deal as a normal acquisition, it could have taken up to a year for FTC approval, even if it was just a rubber stamp.\nGoing this route avoids the need to notify the FTC at all, with Google instead dealing with the risk of a future investigation.\nBilly wrote, \"A year in the world of AI is eternity.\nSpeed is everything, and speed is the driver for this new blitz higher structure.\nIt circumvents the antitrust review process, allows the acquirer to take over the key employees and IP of the startup and have the employees with a badge in their office the next day.\nAnd maybe that's true, but it is not without cost.\nSophie at Netcapgirl writes, \"Windsurf and other deals like it are proof that tech M&A being broken is a massive net negative for the whole ecosystem.\nHealthy capital markets are an essential part of the engine that drives innovation.\nI don't have the solution, but I can't imagine things can continue like this.\"\nJohn Leig from Founders Fund sees a bigger change at work.\nHe wrote that just like the top 1% of startups drive the majority of VC returns, he believes that power law is now applicable to individual engineers as well.\nWhile big tech can spend tens of billions on GPUs, those investments mean nothing without the correct talent in place.\nTherefore, Leig believes that the capital cannon is shifting towards talent.\nHe suggested hyper capitalist AI talent wars will rewrite employment contracts and investment norms, concentrate returns, and raise the bar for mission and capital required to create great new companies.\nLetic foresees a complete repricing of labor and a restructuring of employment agreements to look more like sports or entertainment contracts.\nNow, there is a whole additional dimension of this story, which is what it means for OpenAI.\nThe company has obviously been assailed by the hyper capitalist AI talent wars with Meta coming at them, complications with their deal with Microsoft, losing out on this acquisition.\nBut that, I think, is a subject for another show.\nUltimately, what we have here is an example of just the hyper competitive dynamics and the increased stakes of AI changing long-held norms.\nHow it all shakes out ultimately remains to be seen.\nBut what's very clear is that even when it comes to the startups that are building AI, the expectations of yesterday will not be the expectations of tomorrow.\nFor now though, that's going to do it for today's AI Daily Brief.\nAppreciate you listening or watching as always.\nAnd until next time, peace.\n",
