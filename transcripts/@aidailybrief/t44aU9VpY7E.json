  "cleanText": "Welcome back to The AI Daily Brief.\nToday we have something really interesting, almost a point counterpoint on agent architectures, which is particularly pertinent as the conversation around agentic systems becomes more mainstream and more endemic inside the enterprise.\nOn the one hand, we have Anthropic, which published a piece called \"How We Built Our Multi-Agent Research System.\"\nIt's a really in-depth piece that shows the architecture of their research system featuring an orchestrator, sub agents, tools, etc.\nAnd then on the flip side, we have a blog post from the creators of Devon, the AI code generation tool with an argument against building multi-agent systems.\nThis is obviously a hot topic.\nFor those of you who remember my coverage of Microsoft Build, one of the things that was really notable is that they skipped right on over the stage where we were all excited about some single agent that could do a bunch of stuff and instead moved right into this multi-agent orchestration era where they're building infrastructure for and thinking about and pushing on their customers more complex agentic systems where multiple agents can come together to accomplish more complete and extensive tasks.\nSo let's dig into both of these arguments and figure out what we have to learn from each of them.\nAnd let's start with Anthropic.\nAnthropic's paper talks about multi-agent systems using Anthropic's research agent as an example.\nThe research agent drives Anthropic's version of deep research with the basic idea to ensure that the system can search out information across the web, collate it, and produce a final report.\nAnthropic achieves this through a multi-agent system.\nThey write in their section titled \"Benefits of a Multi-Agent System,\" \"Research work involves open-ended problems where it's very difficult to predict the required steps in advance.\nYou can't hardcode a fixed path for exploring complex topics as the process is inherently dynamic and path dependent.\nThis unpredictability makes AI agents particularly well suited for research tasks.\nThe model must operate autonomously for many turns, making decisions about which directions to pursue based on intermediate findings.\nA linear oneshot pipeline cannot handle these tasks.\"\nAnd so Anthropic instead turns to a multi-agent research system.\nThe system uses a central lead agent that orchestrates the process and multiple sub agents that access search tools.\nA user request comes to the lead agent which then strategizes.\nThe task is broken down into different chunks and instructions are provided to sub agents to carry out each portion of the task.\nThe sub agents can iterate on their search and go a little deeper if they need to, but they're ultimately designed to find very granular individual pieces of information.\nAnthropic gives the example of using the research feature to find a list of every board member across S&P 500 companies.\nIn that example, each sub agent might be tasked with looking for a single company's list of board members.\nAnd once those individual results are returned, the lead agent coalates them into a single report.\nThere are lots of benefits to the method that Anthropic describes.\nTasks are run in parallel with dozens of sub agents working at the same time on different tasks, which as you would imagine significantly increases speed.\nIt also means that each individual sub agent is less critical.\nIn single agent systems, a single failed task could break the entire workflow.\nWhereas with a multi-agent system, the orchestration agent can just spawn a new sub agent, modifying the instructions and try again.\nAnthropic found that they could run tasks using lesser models as sub agents and actually come up with improved results.\nA multi-agent system with Claude 4 opus as the orchestrator and Claw 4 sonnet sub agents outperformed a single Claw 4 opus agent by 90.2% on their internal evaluations.\nMulti-agent systems also allow you to work around context limits.\nThe sub agents can use as many tokens as they need to complete a task, which is a small fragment of the overall workflow.\nYou're essentially working across multiple contacts windows that all feed a compressed answer back to the lead agent.\nFor complex tasks, this avoids having the issue of a single agent hitting the context limit before the task is complete.\nIndeed, Anthropic basically says that there's nothing all that complicated about why these multi-agent systems work.\nThey write, \"Multi-agent systems work mainly because they help spend enough tokens to solve the problem.\nWe found that token usage by itself explains 80% of the improvement of multi-agent systems.\nIn a particular use case of research on the internet, Anthropic argued that a multi-agent system is the most suitable.\"\nNow, this ability to use more tokens is also a downside.\nMulti-agent systems can be extremely expensive to run.\nThey write, \"In our data agents typically use around four times more tokens than chat interactions and multi-agent systems use around 15 times more tokens than chats.\"\nThey write, \"Multi-agent systems require tasks where the value of the task is high enough to pay for the increased performance.\"\nAll right, so that is the multi-agent research system example.\nBut what about this blog post titled simply \"Don't Build Multi-Agents\"?\nThis one, as I said, comes from Cognition, who are mainly focused on building an AI and agenda coding platform.\nAuthor Walden Yan writes, \"Frameworks for LLM agents have been surprisingly disappointing.\nI want to offer some principles for building agents based on our own trial and error and explain why some tempting ideas are actually quite bad in practice.\nBasically, the argument here is that instead of building a multi-agent system, which they argue can be quite fragile, build a single agent that can reliably complete tasks end to end.\"\nNow, what they're not suggesting is some simple architecture of just using one giant agent, loading it up with context, and letting it run.\nBut instead, they're suggesting that users should try a linear handoff design.\nThey cover this in a few different levels of complexity with differences in how the handoff is achieved.\nBut the basic idea is that the first agent receives the query and breaks the requisition down into steps, very similar to the orchestrating agent in a multi-agent system.\nBut then it hands off the necessary context to a sub agent to complete the first subtask.\nThis sub agent then hands off the original context with their additions to the next sub agent and so on and so forth.\nAnd context is the key word here.\nIn fact, the big term that they're focused on in this piece is context engineering.\nThey write, \"In 2025, the models out there are extremely intelligent, but even the smartest human won't be able to do their job effectively without the context of what they're being asked to do.\nPrompt engineering was coined as a term for the effort needed to write your task in the ideal format for an LLM chatbot.\nContext engineering is the next level of this.\nIt's about doing this automatically in a dynamic system.\nIt takes more nuance and is effectively the number one job of engineers building AI agents.\"\nBy way of example, they show a simple schematic of a main agent that breaks down a task into two subtasks, spitting up two sub agents to do those tasks with the main agent then combining the results.\nThey write, \"This is a tempting architecture, especially if you work in a domain of tasks with several parallel components to it.\"\nHowever, it's very fragile.\nThe key point of failure is this.\nThey then use an example of building a Flappy Bird clone.\nThey write, \"This task gets divided into subtask one, build a moving game background with green pipes and hitboxes, and subtask two, build a bird you can move up and down.\"\nIt turns out sub agent one actually mistook your subtask and started building a background that looks like Super Mario Bros..\nSub agent 2 built you a bird, but it doesn't look like a game asset, and it moves nothing like the one in Flappy Bird.\nNow the final agent is left with the undesirable task of combining these two miscommunications.\nThe issue here or the concern at least is that the sub agents don't have enough context to actually deliver the result that the context requires.\nThe blog writes \"You might think that a simple solution would be to just copy over the original task as context to the sub agents as well.\nThat way they don't misunderstand their subtask but remember that in a real production system the conversation is most likely multi-turn.\nthe agent probably had to make some tool calls to decide how to break down the task and any number of details could have consequences on the interpretation of the task.\"\nUnfortunately, they suggest that just giving the context still might not be enough or at least doesn't address all the problems.\nIn the second scenario, where each of the sub agents has the context of the conversation in action so far as well as their work assignments, still could have problems.\nThey write, \"When you give your agent the same flappy bird cloning task this time, you might end up with a bird and background with completely different visual styles.\nSub agent one and sub agent two cannot see what the other was doing.\nAnd so their work ends up being inconsistent with each other.\nThis leads them to two principles of agent design.\nPrinciple one, share context and share full agent traces, not just individual messages.\nAnd principle two, actions carry implicit decisions and conflicting decisions carry bad results.\nThe author writes, \"I would argue that principles one and two are so critical and so rarely worth violating that you should by default rule out any agent architectures that don't abide by them.\nYou might think that this is constraining, but there is actually a wide space of different architectures you could still explore for your agent.\"\nAnd that's where we get into the idea of the single agent that breaks down the task in much the same way that the orchestration agent does, but then does the task sequentially and linearly carrying the context of conversations and actions with it at each step.\nNow, this is not a silver bullet.\nAs they point out, you might run into issues for very large tasks with so many sub parts that context windows start to overflow.\nHowever, the author argues for a set of different approaches that can solve that problem.\nSo, one example they gave of a slightly different architecture for longer tasks is still using the same chain of the original agent doing the subtasks, but with another LLM providing context compression along the way.\nInstead of handing off the full context, a side process compresses the key moments and decisions of the conversation and action so far into a smaller, more manageable set of context that can be used for the next part of the sequence.\nCognition writes, \"This is hard to get right.\nIt takes investments into figuring out what ends up being the key information and creating a system that is good at this.\"\nSo, what to make of these differences in approach?\nFirst of all, it's important to remember that we are talking about different sets of use cases here.\nCognition is narrowly focused on coding agents.\nAnd although the author is not strictly talking about coding agents, this is a main example that they're drawing from as they talk about building a high performance agent that can take on long tasks while retaining context throughout.\nAnthropic, on the other hand, are talking specifically about workflows that lend themselves to parallelization.\nBasically, any workflow where the subtasks are completely independent and discreet and don't rely on one another in how they need to be recombined could be a good candidate for using multi-agent systems.\nThey even note that not every use case is good for this type of system that they're talking about.\nThey write, \"Some domains that require all agents to share the same context or involve many dependencies between agents are not a good fit for multi-agent systems today.\nFor instance, most coding tasks involve fewer truly paralyzable tasks than research, and LLM agents are not yet great at coordinating and delegating to other agents in real time.\nWe found that multi-agent systems excel at valuable tasks that involve heavy parallelization, information that exceeds single context windows, and interfacing with numerous complex tools.\"\nSo, when it comes to which of these approaches you or your company should take, as always, context is king and the use case matters.\nAre the subtasks dependent upon one another or are they truly independent and can be done in parallel?\nThe answer to that is going to dictate which of these systems might be the better choice.\nThe other point to remember is that this is very much a snapshot in time.\nThe cognition author even writes that they're optimistic about the long-term possibilities of agents collaborating with one another.\nIt's just that right now in their estimation running multiple agents in collaboration at today's capability levels results in fragile systems.\nAs you might imagine, there are very few areas of development right now that have more sheer tonnage of brain power on solving some of these issues than these questions of multi-agent systems.\nSo, while as much of the cognition post is well considered and as we discussed, Anthropic even agrees with in some ways, the constraints of today are unlikely to be the constraints of tomorrow.\nStill two really valuable pieces and hopefully even for a lay audience that's listening to this gives you a better sense of how agents are being built right now and how you might want to think about them.\nFor now, that's going to do it for today's AI Daily Brief.\nUntil next time, peace.\n",
