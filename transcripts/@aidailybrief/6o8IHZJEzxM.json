  "cleanText": "Welcome back to the AI Daily Brief, headlines edition. All the daily AI news you need in around 5 minutes. We kick off today with a new program from Anthropic. The initiative is called the Economic Futures Program, and in short, it seeks to support research on how AI is impacting employment and the broader economy. The goal is also to help develop policy proposals to get ahead of any consequent shifts. Sarah Hec, Anthropic's head of policy programs and partnerships, said, \"Everybody's asking questions about what are the economic impacts of AI, both positive and negative. It's really important to root these conversations in evidence and not have predetermined outcomes or views on what's going to happen.\"\n\nNow, if you are a regular listener to this show, you will know that Anthropic CEO Dario Amade has long been of the view that AI labs have a responsibility to participate in the policy discussion and also has been increasing the volume of his warnings about potential job displacement and workforce disruption over the past few months. His most stark warning came in May when he predicted that AI could wipe out almost half of entry-level white-collar work and could drive unemployment as high as 20% over the next 5 years. In January, while discussing the possibility of a post-work society, he said, \"I think AI companies are going to be at the center of that or in the crosshairs of that, and we have a responsibility to have an answer there.\"\n\nSo this new initiative has three pillars. First, Anthropic will hand out research grants to further academic work on the topic. Second, they also intend to create forums for researchers, policy makers, and AI practitioners to come together for policy discussions. Finally, the company wants to scale their AI economic index to create longitudinal data sets that track AI's economic usage and impact. Another way to think about this is Anthropic trying to drive the policy discussion around jobs in AI to something that is a bit more evidence-based. Sarah Hec again commented, \"I think the key goal is to figure out what is actually happening. If there is job loss, then we should convene a collective group of thinkers to talk about mitigation. If there will be huge GDP expansion, great. We should also convene policy makers to figure out what to do with that. I don't think any of this will be a monolith.\"\n\nInterestingly, given how historically job losses from new technologies have tended to be blue-collar first, one of the interesting dimensions of AI is the first places that some of this is showing up seem to be in the industry that's creating the technology in the first place. DOSs of Menllo Ventures wrote, \"There's a deep malaise in tech right now. New grads can't find jobs. Big tech middle managers are trying to justify their existence. Everyone not in AI wants to be in AI. Founders struggling with their startup for years see Roy rewrite the rules.\" In that one, he's referring to Roy from Cluey, who is basically going virality first, product second. Dee continues, \"Combat security is at an all-time high with the meta offers. In other words, why am I working so hard? Tech Net of AI is just not as sexy a job as it used to be 10 years ago.\" He did caveat. \"Of course, this is a massive generalization, but a majority of the conversations I've been having seem to reflect this.\" Still, while all of that might be true, DD even points out that this is all just anecdotal right now. And when it comes to making policy, the discussion would likely be improved if we had real data about actual layoffs. For example, Microsoft slashed several thousand jobs earlier this year, largely for middle management and software engineering. They could be AI-related layoffs, or they could simply be a purge of excess headcount due to a deterioration in economic conditions. The distinction changes the policy implications dramatically.\n\nNow, if you are interested in these topics, Anthropic is fielding applications for grants to be issued in August and seeking submissions for symposiums to be held in Washington and Europe this fall.\n\nNext up, Meta is turning to private capital to fuel their AI buildout. The Financial Times reports that Meta is looking to raise $29 billion from private capital firms to fund their data center approach with the reporting that they are in latestage talks with some of the largest players in the space, including Apollo Global Management, KKR, Brookfield, Carile, and Pimco. Meta is apparently looking to raise 3 billion in equity alongside another 26 billion in debt. If it comes together, this will be one of the largest private capital raises in history. And sources say that Meta could even seek more capital once this round is closed. Meta is working with Morgan Stanley to structure the deal, and sources say there's been an exploration of ways to make the debt more easily tradable once it's issued.\n\nNow, if you're wondering if it is usual for a big tech company to take on private capital in this way, the short answer is that no, it isn't. But the AI buildout is obviously no regular capital cycle. Meta recently upped this year's capex forecast to around 70 billion, a 10% increase on what was already the most capital-intensive year in the company's history. The takeaway of this is that even the largest companies in the world are starting to run up against the limits of public equity to fund these mega projects. Now, of course, we've already seen AI startups take private capital to fund infrastructure. Open AI and SoftBank Stargate project is already courting private investors using a debt funding mechanism more typically used in the oil and gas industry. And more recently, XAI tapped Morgan Stanley to help them market 5 billion in debt. On the other side of the deals, private capital firms like Apollo are increasingly pitching large companies on these deals as an alternative to corporate bonds. The private equity giants now own major insurers and annuity providers, so need a steady supply of high-quality loans to put on their books. As the deals are often structured as special purpose vehicles or joint ventures, they also serve to keep the debt off the balance sheets of the tech firms. You remember on Friday when we talked about how Goldman Sachs has revised its opinion that we were at the end of the capex cycle to now they believe that we are actually in the middle of that cycle, and this would seem to be evidence of that.\n\nLastly today, a super cool one that I hope we will expand into a full episode at some point in the future. AI video platform Runway plans to launch a world-first generative video game platform. This is a tiny first step in a vertical that seems entirely inevitable. That is, of course, AI games that can be generated on the fly. Alex Heath of the Verge was given access to the platform called Game Worlds, which Runway plans to make available as soon as this week. He writes, \"The consumer-facing product is currently quite bare bones with a chat interface that supports only text and image generation, but Runway says that generated video games are coming later this year. Runway is also in talks with gaming companies about both using its technology and accessing their data sets for training.\" So then at the moment, the platform seems to be basically text-based adventure games with generated still images attached. It's unclear how much of the gameplay is generated on the fly or if the experience is just about generating visuals and text to flesh out a prescripted story line. Users will be able to create their own text and image game in the same style, the consistency of which is a whole technical challenge on its own. Regardless of where they are starting, Runway's ambition is very clear. The company is already talking to TV and movie studios. The recently aired Amazon show House of David was made in part using runways technology, and they say that they're working with quote \"pretty much every major studio and most of the Fortune 100 companies now looking to take on the gaming world.\" CEO Christoal Valenuela said, \"If we can help a studio make a movie 40% faster, then we're probably going to be able to help developers of games make games faster. They're waking up, and they're moving faster than I would say the studios were moving 2 years ago.\" Look, I think like I said that this is a completely inevitable thing. Generative games are such a natural extension of many of the types of gameplay experiences that people already love now where you can customize your experience and really choose your own adventure that it's really just going to be constrained by what the technology can do.\n\nOne last interesting note from the Verge piece about this new launch. Heath writes, \"Naturally, I couldn't let Venuela get off our Zoom call without asking him about his recent acquisition talks with Zuckerberg. This is something that we reported on last week as well,\" said Valenuela. \"I think we have more interesting intellectual challenges being independent and remaining independent for now.\"\n",
