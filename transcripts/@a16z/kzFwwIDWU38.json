Right? Well, things have changed, right? The DOS problem is still there, but it's just almost handled as a commodity these days. The network provider, your cloud provider, they'll just deal with it. And so when you're deploying an application, most of the time you just don't have to think about it. The challenge comes when you've got traffic that just doesn't fit those filters. It looks like it could be legitimate, or maybe it is legitimate, and you just have a different view about what kind of traffic you want to see. And so the challenge is really about how do you distinguish between the good bots and the bad bots? And then with AI changing things, it's bots that might even be acting on behalf of humans, right? It's no longer a binary decision. And as the amount of traffic from bots increases, like in some cases, it's the majority of traffic that sites are receiving is from an automated source. And so the question for site owners is, well, what kind of traffic do you want to allow? And when it's automated, what kind of automated traffic should come to your site and what are you getting in return for that? And in the old days, I mean, I guess the old, the old providers, we'll say the legacy providers in this space, like it was very much using a hammer, right? So they would say, hey, if this IP address is coming in, it's probably a bot. Or they would say, if this user agent is coming in, it's probably a bot. Very imprecise. And I think the downside of that is that you probably blocked a lot of legitimate traffic along with illegitimate traffic. And now there's very real consequences because some of these AI bots could be actual users. They're acting on behalf of who are looking to purchase your products. This is the challenge. So a volumetric DOS attack, you just want to block that at the network. You never want to see that traffic. But everything else needs the context of the application. You need to know where in the application the traffic is coming to. You need to know who the user is, the session, and to understand in which case you want to allow or deny that. And so this is this is the real issue for developers, for site owners, for security teams is to make those really nuanced decisions to understand whether the traffic should be allowed or not. And the context of the application itself is so important because it depends on the site. Like if you're running an e-commerce operation, an online store, the worst thing you can do is block a transaction because then you've lost the revenue. Usually you want to then flag that order for review. A human customer support person is going to come in and and determine based on various signals about whether to allow it. And if you just block that at the network, then your application will never see it. You never even know that that order was failed in some way.\n\nThere's been a lot of media releases about companies that have released solutions in this space, but largely they were based on sort of those old kind of approaches using network telemetry. Is that generally how they're working now, or is there is there some other capabilities that they've released because they they give them AI names and you just immediately assume that they're doing something fancy? That's right. Yeah. So blocking on the network is basically how the majority of these old school products work. They do analysis before the traffic reaches your application, and then you never know what the result of that was. And that just doesn't fly anymore. It's it's insufficient for being able to build modern applications, particularly with AI coming in where something like OpenAI has four or five different types of bots, and some of them you might want to make a more restrictive decision over, but then others are going to be taking actions on behalf of a user search, and we're seeing lots of different applications getting more signups, businesses actually getting higher conversions as a result of this AI traffic, and so just blocking anything that is called AI is too blunt of an instrument. You need much more nuance. And the only way you can do that is with the application context, understanding what's going on inside your code. I mean, I'd say we're seeing across the industry that AI is driving incredible amounts of new revenue to companies. And if you use an old world tool to just block any of that traffic, you're probably duping your business. That's right. Or you're you're like putting it into some kind of maze where it's seeing irrelevant content. And then by doing that, you are kind of downranking your site because the AI crawler is never going to come back. It's it's kind of like blocking Google from from visiting your site. It's like yeah, Google doesn't get you in, you no longer in Google's index, but then you're no longer in Google's index, and so anyone searching is not going to find you as a result. Well, and and I believe we had sort of standards in the old days that developed or quasi standards like robots.txt, right, which would tell you like it and tell the crawlers, hey, don't crawl these directories. Are we doing something similar for this new age agentic world? So robots.txt is still the starting place, and it's kind of a voluntary standard. It's it evolved over several decades ago now. It's been around a long time. Bots have been a problem for a long time. And the idea is you describe the areas of your application and tell any robot that's coming to your site whether you want to allow that robot to access that area of the site or not. And you could use that to control the roll out of new content. You could protect certain pages of your site that you just don't want to be indexed for whatever reason. And you can also point the crawler to where you do want it to go. You can use the sitemap for that as well. But the robots text file format has has evolved over time to provide these signals to the likes to to crawlers like search engines from Google and so on. The challenge with that is it's voluntary and there's no enforcement of it. And so you've got good bots like Google bot that will follow the standard and you'll be able to have full control over what it does and but there are newer bots that are ignoring it or even sometimes using it as a way to find the parts of your site that you don't want it to access, and they will just do that anyway. And so this becomes a control problem for the site owner, and you really want to be able to understand not just what the list of rules are, but how they are enforced. Totally. Maybe it'd be great to walk through what these agents are. Maybe maybe get some more understanding of sort of how they operate, what people are using them for. Perhaps go through a couple of the use cases, and then it'd be great to understand sort of like how you do control it because it seems like a far more complicated problem than just bad IP addresses, right? So if we think about OpenAI as an example because they have four or five different crawlers, um, there's one and they all have different names and they all identify themselves in different different ways. So one actually is crawling to train the OpenAI models on your site, and that's the one that probably everyone is thinking about when they're thinking about I want to block AI, the training, and you have different philosophical approaches to how you want to be included in in the training data. The others are more nuanced and more require more thought. Um, so there's one that will go out when a user um is typing something into the chat and has asked a question, and OpenAI will go out and search. Um, it's built up its own search index. And so that's equivalent of Googlebot. You probably want to be in that index because as we we're seeing sites are getting more signups, they're getting more traffic. The discovery process is being part of just another search index is super important. Gotcha. So like when I ask OpenAI, what when is John F. Kennedy's birthday? If it doesn't know the answer, it goes out and and searches the web. Yeah, that's right. Or if it's trying to get open hours for something, it might go to a website for a cafe or whatever and and pass it and then return the results. So that's really just like a classic search engine crawler, except it's kind of happening behind the scenes. Um, the other one is something that's happening in real time. So you might give the agent a specific URL and go and ask it to summarize it or to look up a particular question in the docs um for a developer tool or something like that. And then that's a separate agent that will go out. It will read the website and then it will return and answer the the query. For both of these two examples, OpenAI and others will are now starting to cite those sources. And you'll regularly see, and this is kind of the recommendation, is you get the result from from the AI tool, but you shouldn't trust it 100%. You go and then verify and you look at the docs and maybe it's like when you used to go to Wikipedia and you'd read the summary and then you look at the references and you'd go to all the references and check to make sure what had been summarized is actually correct. But all three of those examples, you clearly could see why you would want them accessing your site by like blocking all of OpenAI's crawlers is probably a very bad idea. Yeah, it's too blunt. It's too blunt an instrument. You need to be able to distinguish each one of these and determine which parts of your site you want them to to get into. And this then comes to the fourth one, which is the actual agent. Um, this is the agent, the computer operator type feature that is headless web browsers, headless web browsers. Yeah. Or even a web browser, a full web browser operating inside a VM. And those are the ones that require more nuance because maybe you're booking a ticket or doing some research, and you do want the agent to take actions on your behalf. Maybe it's going through your email inbox and triaging things. From the application builder's perspective, that's probably a good thing. Um, you want more transactions. You want more usage of your application, but there are examples where it might be a bad a bad action. So, for example, if you're building a tool that is going to try and buy all of the concert tickets and then sell them on later, that becomes a problem for the concert seller because they don't want to do that. They want the true fans to be able to get access to those. And again, you need the nuance. Maybe you allow the bot to go to the homepage and sit in a queue, but then when you get to the front of the queue, you want the human to actually make the purchase. And you want to rate limit that so that maybe the human can only purchase, let's say, five tickets. You don't want them to purchase 500 tickets. And so this gets into the real details of the context of each one about what you might want to allow and what you might want to restrict. That's incredibly complicated. I mean, if I remember back why we made a lot of the decisions we made in blocking bots was strictly because of scale. So, you know, you've got 450,000 IP addresses sending you terabytes of traffic through a link that only can do gigabit, and you've got to just start dropping stuff, right? And you take you you know, it's it's the battlefield triage of the wounded, right? It's like some of some of you aren't going to make it, and it becomes a little brutal. That sounds incredibly sophisticated. How do you do that sort of fine grain control of traffic flow at internet scale? So, this is about building up layers of protections. So, you start with the robots.txt, just managing the good bots. Then you look at IPs and start understanding where's the traffic coming from. In an ideal scenario, you have one user per IP address, but we all know that that doesn't happen. That never happens. And so you can start to build up databases of reputation around the IP address, and you can access the underlying metadata about that address, knowing which country it's coming from or which network it belongs to. And then you can start building up these decisions, thinking, well, we shouldn't really be getting traffic from a data center for our signup page, and so we could block that that network. Um, but it becomes more challenging if we have that agent example, the agent with a with a web browser or headless browser is going to be running on a server somewhere. It's probably in a data center, and then you have the compounding factor of that abusers will purchase access to proxies which run on residential IP addresses. So you can't easily rely on the fact that it's part of a a home ISP block anymore. And so you have to build up these patterns, understanding the reputation of the IP address. Then you have the user agent string that is a basically a free text field that you can fill in with whatever you like. There is kind of a standard there, but the good bots will tell you who they are. It's been surprising and getting into the details of this how many bots actually tell you who they are. And so you can block a lot of them just on that heristic combined with the IP address or allow them or allow them. Yeah, I'm the shopping bot from OpenAI. Yeah, come on in, buy some stuff. Exactly. And Google bot, OpenAI, they tell you who they are, and then you can verify that by doing a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address. So even though you might be able to pretend to be Google bot, you can check to make sure that that's the case or not with very low latency lookups. So we can verify that yes, this is Google, I want to allow them. Yes, this is the OpenAI bot that is doing the search indexing. I want to allow that. The next level from that is building up fingerprints and fingerprinting the characteristics of the request, and this started with the J3 hash, which was invented at Salesforce and has now been developed into a J4. Some of them are open source, these these algorithms, some of them are are not. So essentially you take all of the metrics around a session and you create a hash of it and then you stick it in a database. Exactly. And you look for matches to that hash. You look for\n\n\nMatches and then the idea is that the\nhash will change based on the client.\nSo you can allow or deny certain\nclients, but if you have a huge number\nof those clients all spamming you, then\nthey all look the same, they all have\nthe same fingerprint and you can just\nblock that fingerprint.\nSo this is almost like if you think of,\nyou know, I always think of things in\nterms of the classic sort of network\nstack like you know layer zero up to\nlayer 7, like this is almost like layer\n2 level identity for devices.\nRight.\nIt's looking at the TLS handshake on the\nnetwork level and then you can go up up\nthe layers.\nUm, there's one called J4H which looks\nat the HTTP headers.\nUm and the earlier versions of this\nwould be working on the ordering of the\nheaders for instance.\nSo an easy way to work around it is just\nto shift the headers.\nThe hashing is has improved over time so\nthat even changing the ordering of that\nof the headers doesn't change the hash.\nAnd the idea is that you can then\ncombine all of these different signals\nto try and come to a decision about\nwhether you think this is um or who who\nit is basically making the request.\nAnd if it's malicious, you can block it\nbased on that.\nAnd if it's someone that you want to\nallow, then you can do so.\nAnd this is before you even get into\nkind of the the the user level, what's\nactually happening in the application,\nright?\nThat's right.\nYeah.\nSo this is the logic on top of that\nbecause you have to identify who it is\nfirst before you apply the rules about\nwhat you want them to do.\nGotcha.\nSo it's almost like you're adding an\nauthentication layer or an identity\nlayer to sort of the transport side.\nThat's right.\nYeah.\nAnd the the application side, I guess I\nshould say.\nYeah.\nThe application.\nYeah.\nBut it's throughout the whole whole\nstack, the whole OSI model.\nAnd the idea is you have this consistent\nfingerprint that you can then apply\nthese rules to and identity kind of\nlayers on top of that.\nAnd we've seen some interesting\ndevelopments in um fingerprinting and\nproviding signatures based on um who the\nrequest is coming from.\nSo, a couple of years ago, Apple\nannounced Privacy Pass, um, which is a a\nhash that is attached to every request\nyou make.\nIf you're in the Apple ecosystem using\nSafari on on iPhone or on Mac, then\nthere is a way to authenticate that the\nrequest is coming from an individual who\nhas a subscription to iCloud and Apple\nhas their own fraud analysis to allow\nyou to subscribe to iCloud.\nSo it's a very it's an easy assumption\nto make that if you have a subscription\nand this signature is verified then you\nare a real person.\nThere's a new one that Cloudflare\nrecently published around doing the same\nthing for automated requests and having\na fingerprint that's attached to\nsignature inside every single request\nwhich you can then use public key\ncryptography to verify.\nThese are all emerging as the problem of\nbeing able to identify automated\nclients increases because you want to be\nable to know who the good ones are to\nallow them through whilst blocking all\nthe attackers.\nYeah.\nAnd it's just like the old days with\nKerros, right?\nEvery vendor, every large vendor is\ngoing to have their flavor, right?\nAnd if you're a shop and you're trying\nto sell to everybody, you've got to kind\nof work with all of them.\nThat's right.\nAnd you just need to be able to\nunderstand is this a human and is our\napplication built for humans and then\nyou allow them or is it that we're\nbuilding an API or do we want to be\nindexed and we want to allow this\ntraffic.\nIt's just giving the site owner the\ncontrol.\nYeah.\nI mean I think it's what's what's really\ninteresting to me is that in my own use\nand in my own life like I interact with\nthe internet less and less directly\nlike almost every day and I'm going\nthrough some sort of AI type thing.\nIt could be an agent.\nIt could be an large language model.\nIt could be any number of things.\nBut I generally don't query stuff\ndirectly as much as I used to.\nAnd it seems like we're moving to a\nworld where almost the layer you\ndescribe, the agent type activity you\ndescribe will become the primary\nconsumer of everything on the internet.\nWell, if 50% of traffic is already\nbots, it's already automated and agents\nare only really just getting going.\nMost people are not using these\ncomputer use agents because they're too\nslow right now.\nThey're not there's still like previews\nbut it's clear that's where everything\nis going then we're going to see an\nexplosion in the traffic that's coming\nfrom these tools and just blocking them\njust because they're AI is the wrong\nanswer.\nYou've really got to understand why you\nwant them, what they're doing, who\nthey're coming from and then you can\ncreate these granular rules.\nI mean, I hate to use the analogy, but\nthese things are almost like avatars,\nright?\nThey're running around on someone's\nbehalf and you need to figure out who\nthat someone is and what the what the\nobjectives are, right?\nAnd control them very granularly.\nAnd the old school methods of doing that\nassume malicious intent, which isn't\nalways the case and know increasingly is\ngoing to be not the case because you\nwant the agents to be doing things and\nthe signals just no longer work when\nyou're expecting traffic to come from a\ndata center or you're expecting it to\ncome from an automated Chrome instance.\nUm, and being able to have the\nunderstanding of your application to dig\ninto the the characteristics of the\nrequest is going to be increasingly\nimportant in the future of\ndistinguishing how criminals are using\nAI.\nWhat we've seen so far is either\ntraining and people have that opinion of\nwhether they want to train or not or\nit's bots that maybe have got something\nwrong.\nThey're accessing the site too much\nbecause they haven't thought about\nthrottling or they're ignoring\nrobots.ext rather than looking at\nagents.ext text, which is distinguishing\nbetween an agent you want to access your\nsite and a and some kind of crawler.\nAnd the examples that we've seen are just\nbots coming to websites and just\ndownloading the content continuously.\nThere's no world where that should be\nhappening.\nAnd this is where the cost is being put\non the site owner because they currently\nhave no easy way to manage the control\nuh control the um the traffic that's\ncoming to their site.\nDirectionally things are improving\nbecause you might have looked back 18\nmonths and the bots are have no rate\nlimiting.\nThey're just downloading content all the\ntime.\nToday we know that these bots can be\nverified.\nThey are identifying themselves.\nThey are much better citizens of the\ninternet.\nThey are following starting to follow\nthe rules.\nAnd so over the next 18 months I think\nwe'll see more of that more of the AI\ncrawlers that we want following the\nrules doing things in the right way.\nAnd it will start to split into making a\nlot easier to detect the the bots with\ncriminal intent and those are the ones\nthat we want to be blocking.\nSo with the transition of bots from\nbeing these entities on the internet\nthat represent third parties and\norganizations to this new world where\nthese AI agents could be representing\norganizations.\nThey could be representing customers.\nThey could be representing any number of\npeople and this is probably the wave of\nthe future.\nIt seems to me like detecting that it's\nAI or a person is going to be an\nincredibly difficult challenge.\nAnd I'm curious like how are you\nthinking about proving humanness on the\ninternet?\nRight.\nWell, proofing proofing is a is a is a\ntale as old as time.\nThere's a NIST working group on proofing\nidentity that's been running I think for\n35 years and like still hasn't really\ngotten to something that's\nimplementable.\nThere's 15 companies out there, right?\nThe first wave of of ride share\nservices and gig economy type companies\nneeded to have proofing, right?\nBecause you're hiring these people in\nremote places where you don't have an\noffice and it's still not a solved\nproblem.\nI'm curious like it feels like maybe AI\ncan help get us there or maybe there's\nsomething that's happening in that\nspace, right?\nWell, the the pure solution is digital\nsignature, right?\nBut we've been talking about that for so\nlong and the the UX around it is\nbasically impossible for normal people\nto to figure out.\nAnd it's why something like email\nencryption, no one encrypts their email.\nYou have encrypted chat because it's\nbuilt into the app and it can do all the\ndifficult things like the key exchange\nbehind the scenes.\nSo that solution isn't really going to\nwork.\nBut AI has been used in analyzing\ntraffic for at least over a decade.\nIt's just it was called machine\nlearning.\nAnd so you start with machine learning\nand the question is well what does the\nthe new generation of AI allow us to do.\nThe challenge with the LLM type models\nis just the speed at which they are\ndoing analysis because you often want to\ntake a decision on the network or in the\napplication within a couple of\nmilliseconds otherwise you're going to\nbe blocking the traffic and the user is\ngoing to become annoyed.\nAnd so you can do that with kind of\nclassic machine learning models and do\nthe inference really quickly.\nAnd where I think the interesting thing\nin the next few years is going to be is\nhow we take the this new generation of\ngenerative AI using LLMs or other types\nof LLM like technology to do analysis on\nhuge traffic patterns.\nI think that can be done in the\nbackground initially, but we're already\nseeing new edge models that are designed\nto be deployed to mobile devices and IoT\nthat use very low amounts of system\nmemory and can provide inference\nresponses within milliseconds.\nI think those are going to start to be\ndeployed to applications um over the\nnext few years.\nWell, I think you're exactly right.\nLike I think so much of what we're\nseeing now is just being restricted by\nthe cost of inference and that cost is\ndropping incredibly fast, right?\nIt's we saw this with cloud where like\nS3 went to being the most expensive\nstorage you could buy to being free,\nessentially free.\nGlacier is essentially free, right?\nFree is beer, right?\nWhatever.\nUm and so like we're seeing that even at\na more accelerated rate for inference,\nlike the cost is just falling\nincredibly.\nAnd then when you look at the\ncapabilities of these new technologies\nto drop a suspicious email into a into\nchat GPT and ask if it's suspicious and\nit's like 100% accurate, right?\nLike if you want to like find sensitive\ninformation, you ask the LLM, is it\nsensitive information?\nAnd it's like 100% accurate.\nLike it's amazing.\nLike as you squint and look at the\nfuture, you can start to see these\nreally incredible use cases, right?\nLike to your point of inference on the\nedge, like do you think we all end up\neventually with like an an LLM running\nlocally that's basically going to be\nclippy but for CISOs?\nLike it pops up and says, \"Hey, it\nlooks like you're doing something\nstupid.\"\nLike is that is that kind of where you\nthink we land?\nThat's what we're working on is getting\nthis analysis into the process so that\nfor every single request that comes\nthrough, you can have a sandbox that\nwill analyze the full request and give\nyou a response.\nWhereas now you can wait maybe two to\nfive seconds to delay an email and do\nthe analysis and decide whether to flag\nit for review or send it to someone's\ninbox.\nDelaying an HTTP request for 5 seconds,\nthat's not going to work.\nAnd so I think the the trend that we're\nseeing with the improvement cost, the\ninference cost, but also the latency\nand getting the inference decision,\nthat's going to be the key.\nSo we can embed this into the\napplication.\nYou've got the full context window.\nSo you can add everything you know about\nthe user, everything about the session,\neverything about your application\nalongside the request and then come to\ndecision entirely locally on your web\nserver, on the edge, wherever it\nhappens to be running.\nAs I listen to you say that and\ndescribe this process, all I can think\nis that advertisers are going to love\nthis.\nIt just seems like the kind of\ntechnology built for sort of like, hey,\nhe's looking at this product, show him\nthis one.\nRight.\nYeah.\nSuper fast inference on the edge coming\nto a decision.\nAnd for advertisers, stopping click\nspam, that's that's a huge problem.\nAnd being able to come to that decision\nbefore it even goes through your your ad\nmodel and the the auction system.\nWho would have ever thought that\nnon-deterministic, incredibly cheap\ncompute would uh would solve these use\ncases, right?\nRight.\nYeah.\nWe're in a weird world.\n",
