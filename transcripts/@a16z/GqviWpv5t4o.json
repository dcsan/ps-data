  "cleanText": "So robot body process automation is\nliterally if a human had to do something,\nyou basically open some browser or\nwhatever, take some data, put it into some\nother system, click some button, and all\nthat stuff. So it records that human\nclicks on that desktop and tries to keep\nrepeating it. So you kind of get\nthat automated, and the hard part that\nthey had is you can't do robotic process\nfor unstructured data because it's not\nfixed; they change it. So anything will\nbe very, very brutal. The bet that we are\ntaking is that AI will drive automation\nin a significant way. RPA would be fully\neaten by AI automation, and the future is\nlikely going to be more of decentralized\nfederated\nexecution. I'll just give you a little\nbit of history. When I was doing research\nat MIT, uh, and I think big data was a big\nthing in 2015, everybody was doing this.\nAnd so, first, let me just define\nunstructured data because people have\ndifferent definitions of unstructured\ndata. So my definition is very simple.\nAnything that cannot be put into nice\ndatabase tables where you can run SQL.\nAnything that is not that is\nunstructured data. So like a PDF\ndocument or an image or or anything.\nYeah. Anything that cannot be put into a\nnice table that you can run a query. And\nwe already knew how to answer questions\nwhen data is nicely in a structured\nformat. So at MIT, the question that they\nwere trying to ask was how do you answer\nquestions when data is not in that\nformat? So, and that's very heterogeneous;\nthat basically, they didn't have any\nschema. You don't even know what\nquestions are relevant or not. So that\nwas the key sort of hypothesis, and we\nwere building this product called data\nhub, and this has the ability to mount\ndifferent kinds of things. So you could\nmount file systems, you could mount\ndatabases, and you can mount something\ncalled application node. So because some\ndata also lives in random applications,\nand can you ask any question? So that\nwas a big research project. I was like,\nthis could be very valuable. So I\ndropped out. I didn't solve the whole\nproblem and came here in Silicon Valley,\nand then I started talking to a bunch of\ncompanies, tell me what is your\nunstructured data problem because we\nhave to figure out business or the where\nto sell and where is the real, real value\nfor the for the organizations, especially\nenterprises, and we got pulled into this\ngnarly problem, which is here are all my\nimages and documents and Excel and\nPowerPoint, and can you help me answer\nquestions? So my first question was why\ndo you even care what question you want\nto answer? We need to understand that, and\nthey're like, we do a bunch of processes\nthat receives a ton of unstructured data,\nand we have to make a decision, like, for\nexample, if immigration, when somebody\napplies for immigration, they submit a\nbunch of things, and they have to make a\ndecision whether they should give you a\nvisa or not, or you apply for a loan, you\nsubmit a bunch of things, and they have to\nmake a decision whether you should get a\nloan or not. So we were like, sounds\ninteresting, so let's let's think about\nhow to solve it. And you won't believe it,\nthe techniques at that time were\nvery rudimentary. So there were four\ncommon techniques that people used.\nNumber one, they call this like\ntemplates, where they will simply say,\nhere is a template for a passport, and if\nyou want a passport number, go look 10\npixels below and 10 pixels from the right\nand draw a 20-pixel long box, and\nwhatever you find is your passport\nnumber. Good luck with that. Yeah, it's\nvery, very brittle, right? Because as\nsoon as you scan differently and think\nthings will break. Second techniques\nwere basically people writing different\nkinds of rules, like go and look for the\nkeyword period beginning and anything\nright of that age of start date or\nsomething, doesn't work, like it just\nbreaks. A third technique people were\ntrying to train these ML models by\nwriting features for a specific document\ntype, and what feature do you write for\nlike base step? It's just very, very hard,\nso those also didn't work. So we\nbasically at that time started doing\nresearch, which we killed in 2 years,\nwhich called program synthesis, which is\nwe were basically like, if I had access\nto amazingly intelligent people, how do I\nsolve the unstructured data problem? I will\nask them to write code for you know on\nthe fly, so can I\nbasically ask a computer to synthesize a\nprogram on the fly? It's very, very hard\nfor a computer to write a program at that\ntime. LLMs were in the thing, but we would\nlike most of the data can be extracted\nfrom documents and all that by writing\nsome form of regular expression and\nthose kind of things. So let's do the\nsynthesis of these regular expressions\nbased on what input-output combination\nthat you give, and that is the answer, and\nthat worked reasonably well as long as\nyour input is in a similar kind of\nstructure because the problem with\nprograms is it's deterministic. So if\nyour input changes, it will break. So, but\nit still produced reliable results, but\nnot good enough that we could solve many\nproblems, but we could solve some part of\nthe problems. So this was 2017, and\ntransformer paper\ncame, we, and, and I think with the\ntransformer paper, they also released a\nmodel called Bolt at that time. So we were\nsuper excited. We were like because that\nwas like state-of-the-art and like best\nsort of model to understand natural\nlanguage. So we basically applied B on\nthese unstructured documents. We took a\nbunch of those tokens and put that, and\nthat produced really bad results. Mhm.\nReally, really bad results. So we would\nlike at that time, actually, I sent a note\nwhich Martine would have a copy of, which\nwe were like, seems like this problem is\nnot solvable unless somebody solves AI\ncomplete problems, which they call, you\nknow, AGI, that you can, but we were like,\nthere's nothing else that is promising\nenough, so what do we do? So we basically\ntried to use some creative approach that\nif you look at the Burke language model,\nthey were encoding the token as the\nposition of the word in the sentence, and\nand that's how the attention mechanism\nwould work and and and would do the fill\nmask problem. Yeah. So we were like,\nwhat if we also start encoding in\naddition to the position of the word in\nthe sentence, X and Y coordinate too? So\nwe basically took 110 million documents,\ntook every single word or the token and\nencoded with the position in the\nsentence, but more importantly, x and y\ncoordinate, and then tried to basically\nsolve fill mask problem by basically\nblocking and see that if that box can be\nfilled by the by the model and trained a\nmodel which is similar to bt, we call\nthis\ninstallm, and that produced great results\nbecause the attention is now not just\nlooking at the sequence of tokens, but\nalso xy coordinate in the two\ndimensional face, which is really, really\ncool from the perspective of the\ndocument layout understanding. And I\nthink is it fair to say that has become,\nI mean, this is much later today, but\ntoday is sort of a standard technique\nalmost, right? If you're looking at two\ndimensional data, you have some rotary\nencoding of x and y or something like\nthat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So at that time,\nthat was not, that was not the case. So\nactually, Rafal, who was one of our ML\nengineers, he, you will see those two or\nthree papers being in the top of the\narena during during that time. So we were\nvery happy. We started winning a lot of\ndeals. We tripled our revenue that year,\n2021 to 2022. But then OpenAI launched at\nGPT, which is November 2022. It turns out\nthe the bitter lesson held, size matters.\nSo, and we were like, oh man, like there is\na better, basically, you could actually\npass the documents, and at that time, they\ndidn't support documents in the in the\nfirst release, but you could basically\ntake the text with the positions, like\npreserve, and pass, and it could, it did a\nreasonably good, good job, and we were\nlike, is this end of Instabase? Like, like\nyou can now seems like seems like solve\nsolve this whole problem, and then we\nrealized that there is just a ton of\nthings, and I think there is a paper by\nDataBricks, which is compound AI system\nthat are very good, but you need a bunch,\nbunch of systems before and after this\nfor that to be reliable, and we can get\ninto the details, but that is the history\nof how we are where we are today. Yeah.\nAmazing. Very small personal anecdote. I\nhave a lot of PDF files. Everything,\nevery piece of paper I get, I just scan\nand dump into a folder, and I recently\nwrote myself a little tool that\nbasically, first, I asked an LLM to come\nup with a hierarchy of of of documents.\nYou know, we're a family of five. You\nknow, here's some things about our our\nyou know, about our family, and then give\nme give me a document hierarchy. And\nthen basically by taking taking a\ndocument and just giving taking the\nsummary of the document, giving to an LLM,\nsay which which folder should this go\ninto. That's an amazingly efficient\nsorting algorithm. It's it's really\nimpressive what what LLMs can do. So, so\ntoday you have a solution that basically\nallows enterprises or or you know,\ncompanies to work with with unstructured\ndata. Can you talk a little bit about\nwhat this does? What some of the use\ncases are? So the use case is pretty\nsimple, which is, let's say, I'll take a\nsimple example of a bank that wants to\ndo lending or an insurance company that\nwants to basically process your claims.\nSo let's take one of one of these two\nuse cases. So when when people apply for\nlet's say application of home loan, it's\nlike literally a 100-page long packet, and\nyou don't even know where is what. It\ncould be that first 10 pages is their\nbank statements, a shoe box of documents,\nand in between there might be cat's\npicture.\nrandom letter from the issue. I think is\nthere is no one structure. What bank says\nI need to something that can verify your\nincome, I need something that verifies\nyour identity. So it's not that they tell\nyou, here is my passport, and here is my\ndriver's license, here is application\npacket, and go go and process it. You have\nto do this reliably because you cannot\nmake a single error. You can just think\nabout like how do you solve this? So\nthere are two techniques, and that's what\nyou know, one of the I I think paper that\nwe wrote is LLM is not all you need\nbecause one thing that you can do is put\nthat into some stuff and ask the LLM the\nquestion, but the problem is if it goes\nbeyond the context window, then that's a\nproblem. You can do rag because rag is a\ntechnique where you put that into some\nvector database, figure out for what\nquestion what are the relevant chunks\nthat could be useful, and then produce\nthat, but how do you know something you\ndid not miss? You might get precision, but\nif you miss something, then that's a\nproblem, and LLMs are great, but they make\nsurprising errors. So, for example, let's\nsay you have a 10-page long bank statement\nwith tables. Somehow they will get a lot\nof things right, but miss like four\nrandom cells with the value, and you\ndon't even know that they missed it, and\nthat just changes the whole thing. So\nthese are very surprising kind of\nerrors. So we looked at like how do you\nsolve this reliably because reliability\npart is important because these are\ncomplex decisions that banks or\ninsurance companies or immigration make.\nUm, so the right way to solve this is how\ndo you know how to split this particular\npacket into a bunch of things we care\nabout? So you have to analyze every\nsingle thing in detail. Once you have\ndone this, then how do you get all of\nthese structures that we care about, like\nfor example, we run a separate table to\ntext algorithm rather than passing the\nwhole thing to LLM because how do you\nknow you didn't miss four things? How do\nyou make sure all the cells are correct?\nSimilar thing for checkboxes and the\nsignatures and other things that that\nbasically matter. Once you have\nclassified, then what are the relevant\nschemas that we need? Then you basically\ngo and do those things. How do you\nvalidate that each of those things are\ncorrect? Then write validations and then\ndo cross-valid validation because is the\npast saying the same thing that W2 does?\nBecause if not, then that so basically\nthe what what we provide is this\ninterface where people can build all of\nthose things without writing a single\nline of code, and then you build\nthis application, and now you can run\nthis application as part of deployment,\nwhich will integrate with your upstream\nand downstream, so now you can do lending\nin like less than 5 seconds rather than\nearlier that would have taken several\nseveral weeks. There's one very\ninteresting use case is intelligence use\ncase, for example. So let's say, and and\nand that's where I talk about why\nthe approaches are critically important.\nSo let's say you are a country and you\nwant to collect a bunch of intelligence,\nyou collect a bunch of intelligence data,\nand you want to answer if there is any\nthreat to the country. So, and you\nreceive like, let's say, millions of\ndocuments per day. One way to dump that\nall into some rag system and ask a\nquestion. How do you know you didn't\nmiss anything? Because they care about\nthat. And maybe the right way to answer\nthat question is not putting all the\ndocuments into a search, rather looking\nat every single page of the document.\nLook for the things that you care about,\nlike which is terrorism threat or money\nlaundering or whatever, and then extract\nthat, put that into a database, run SQL\nquery, once the things that match, then go\nand do the deeper analysis because now\nyou guarantee completeness. So I think\nthat what what we have seen is that\nwhile rag is good for casual search, you\nneed a complex workflow under the hood\nthat is explainable, that is auditable,\nthat is guaranteed to be accurate and\ncorrect is important for solving many of\nthese enterprise problems. So that's\nwhat we do. We help basically\nenterprises take any kind of\nunstructured data and make decisions\nfrom it for reliable, 100% complete, and\naccurate use case. There are cases where\nwe can make an error, and in that case,\nwe have to pass to humans, like, hey,\nseems like something is wrong, can you go\nand look at it totally. And look, I mean,\nI think this is the trend with current AI\nsystems, right? I've not encountered an AI\nsystem yet that is perfect, and and by\nsome metric, I think we never will, right?\nI think what we what you need is is\nfinding things with reasonable error\nrates and then a good escalation path to\nhumans to deal with those, right? Exactly.\nAnd even humans, humans are not 100%\ncorrect, right? So you have to build the\nright processes to catch it, so that's\nwhy I think sometimes when people say\nthis AI doesn't. It's just that AI is not\nsupposed to work reliably 100% of the\ntime. You have to build a system around\nit so that and and that is going to be a\nlot of investment that you will see\nacross the board, which is how do we\nbuild the right systems around AI and\nLLM that solves the problem. Is there a\nshift in how enterprises or or general, I\nthink consumers of AI think about\nreliability? I mean, look, look\nclassically, if I'm a chief compliance\nofficer in a bank or so, I have a new\npiece of software, and you know, my take\nis this software can never do X because\nthat puts us out of compliance. I\nrecently spoke to to a bank that\nbasically said like, well, we tried\nthat. It doesn't work with AI, right? So\nnow we're saying, you know, the the a\nwell-trained human gets us out of\ncompliance about X times, you know,\nevery X hours or so, right? And so the\nAI has to be 10x better, and then we're\ngoing to sign off on it. Uh, you know,\nso so you you you cannot have absolute\nperfection. Um, so so you know, we have\nto sort of change the acceptance\ncriteria. Is is that something you're\nseeing as well? I think more important\nis predictability. I think people are\nfine with errors as long as errors are\n\n\nPredictable. When errors are not predictable, that's where the problem is. So when basically somebody makes an error and you don't even know the error was made, that's when, because in humans, you know, they will make 3-4% error, you know, but if you put the second human by default, the chance of that is low.\n\nAnd with AI, the issue is that they're pretty accurate. They're very good, and but they make mistakes in a surprisingly unpredictable way. And that is a bigger problem, and that's where I think the tooling and systems around it to detect them, to be able to explain when the error was made, to be able to figure out how to catch them, or building a system that allows you to minimize that effect, that is the critical part. So I think in general, what we have seen is enterprises are fine using AIs as long as we show them predictability. They don't care about, you know, 99% accuracy. You can be 90% accurate or even 80% accurate, but just tell us which 20% need to be reviewed or which 20% need to go somewhere, and that requires a lot of systems around these tools to get there. So I think we sometimes misunderstand what enterprises want. They don't want 100% accuracy. They want...\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Is this the future, that essentially, you know, in the future, if an organization receives a document, that typically a human will no longer see the document, but will primarily look at an AI-generated summary, or, you know, AI will pre-parse it and and and, you know, AI can reason about it at a higher layer? Whenever unstructured data like documents come in, humans will still see some kind of dashboard with like whatever stuff is, and only the thing of interest they will go and double-click on, and AI will do a lot of things to minimize their time to get to that thing of interest very, very quickly. Like Google is a great example, when you search, like you don't read every single thing Google gives you, like here is maybe three or four things of interest that you want to double-click and do research on, and I think AI will play a similar important role where in many cases it gets rid of the boilerplate. It reduces things to the absolute essential.\n\nYeah. Are we looking at a world where my system will take, you know, my couple of key points or key phrases and generate a PDF document, then your system will take the PDF document, reduce it back on a couple of key points and phrases?\n\nExactly.\n\nThat's I guess not a bad way to operate in the future. What is the most interesting use case you've seen for your technology? Anything sort of out of the ordinary? I think I think what we are seeing, customers being a lot more creative than we had ever imagined. So just think of, I was working with a bank in India, and now, given that AI has become reasonably reliable, they are offering entire lending over WhatsApp. So you go to WhatsApp, you say, like, hey, I'm a business and I want a loan, and then on WhatsApp you get a response back saying, hey, can you upload these things, your last 30 days of like all the, you know, your P&L statement and whatever those things look, and you basically peacemeal, you submit these three, four, like, oh, this looks good, can you also do this? And I've never seen like lending being done conversationally over WhatsApp. This is insane. Like the customer experience is like fundamentally very different, and I think that I do believe that over the coming years it is going to change the user experience in a very, very significant way. Currently, I think a lot of people think AI is a technology and, you know, how we can use this inside software. I think that the biggest impact would be with the degree of affordance that it gives you. You can completely build a new class of interaction with your customers that would never have been possible. And we are seeing more and more of those. Currently, like all of these processes like insurance claims and all, it's a pretty painful process, right? And I think America is slightly more conservative in those things, but if you go to developing world where digitization is more of a new thing and people are already using all the stuff on phone, things are just moving in a way where, you know, AI makes you feel like you're talking to humans. Nobody loved chatbots before, but now you feel good because they basically are conversing with you in pretty similar to human-like behavior and that interface coupled with all the customer interaction that they have. Of course, one of the big use cases that everybody's trying to go after is a call center. But just think of every other things too, like how do you create an account, how do you do lending, how do you do processing, it will have significant impact on how the user experience is going to change in a very, very significant way.\n\nYeah, totally. And I think there's even, I think, an opportunity here to take some processes which currently were very, you know, I take a lot of documents, I throw them over a wall, and back comes a response, to really turn to something more interactive, right? Where it's like, hey, Guido, you know, tell me more about your SP use case, okay, then I need these documents and I send them, it's like, well, that document is missing something, and you know, you can do this interactive with very, very short latency, everything, even immigration, right? Like you send the stuff and you don't even know, you know, two months later you hear like your stuff is rejected or we need something like this, all of those things can fundamentally be changed. I just got a letter back from the IRS. I submitted a long application with lots of supporting documents. I got a form that I read saying the documentation is not complete without any mention of what is not complete. And so you're saying like, what does this mean? Right? This can be just much more interactive and because now you can do things in real time and and so I'm pretty optimistic on the impact of this on every single business on how they interact with their customers.\n\nThat that makes no sense. What do you see as the main barriers for companies to adopt this? It's like, you know, I mean, I've seen, I've seen many, you know, a classic enterprise adopting AI. There's discussions around, you know, compliance and legal and where does my data go and and, you know, like a long list of of of um sort of concerns that are being expressed. What are the top sort of items that you've seen? The enterprises are not historically known for moving very quickly. So that's that's number one. So I think expecting that like I would say they're moving a little quicker in the AI revolution than they did previously.\n\nExactly. In general, I think each of these large enterprises have to get approval from their compliance committee and the regulations committee, you know, and they all basically, and not none of them really understand things, and sometimes you get regulations that might or questions that might not even be applicable, like for example, tell me every time you change the feature how to LLMs, like we LLM developers don't change features, right? And but but you get like all all of those things that that basically is is a is a massive time sync. But I think the two key things that they care about is how do you guarantee that my data is safe and secure. So that's number one. And second is how do you give me auditability and predictability. That's the two more like if you boil down to all their questions, they eventually boil down to those two things. Like nobody wants like AI making a decision even if it is correct if they cannot explain here are the set of steps that it took. Because if if something wrong happened, they have to explain because in human world you can explain something came, this went to these five different teams where they did this part and this particular error was made and that's why, which we will correct in future so that this kind of mistake would not happen. If AI becomes a black box with no instrumentation of how things get done internally, that that basically has a hard time, especially for customer-centric use cases. For simple casual search and those kind of things is fine, but the runtime has to be something that is auditable and you should be able to find if something went wrong, where it went wrong, and they don't tell you directly. They ask the question that eventually boils down to this, but that's what we have seen at the major requirement.\n\nMakes sense. Let me switch tax here a little bit. We've seen, you know, one of the, I think, hottest buzzwords at the moment are agents, right? And we're sort of, you know, there, it's an overused term. It's sometimes used as a marketing term for, you know, a glorified set of prompts, basically, right? But we're also seeing it as a essentially different user interface paradigm, right? Where where I no longer walk through a transaction step by step, but basically I give a high-level instruction to an agent, the agent acts autonomously. We're even seeing yourself as a software design paradigm where I now have multiple agents that work together and, you know, make decisions more autonomously. How do you think this will change with, you know, how enterprises process data, how we work with unstructured data, and then this entire space? So let's look at like what we already know that has worked well. So what we already know that has worked well is enterprises already know how to run some workflow that is created by some developer and they define a bunch of steps using some workflow management tool and you can run it. So people already know how to run this. The argument you can make is, can we just tell the agent like, give me the answer and they do it? The problem with currently the agents are, if you just give them the same goal and the same set of tools, and they might choose a different path two different times. So they are not guaranteed to deterministically always go in one path. So in general, people don't like runtime inconsistencies. So runtime has to be consistent. So I think the where I have seen things work well within enterprises during build time, when somebody has to define the control path and the logic and all of those kind of things, you can maybe have an agent produce the first draft or like, hey, this is how I plan to execute, this is what it looks like, because otherwise a human might have taken a long period of time, pretty similar to cursor, right? If you want to build something, they can write the first draft of the code, the human can look, make some minor edits, but then you run that code.\n\nExactly. So my point is, I think it's the same way. So I do not believe that autonomous agents would be a runtime phenomena. However, there would be a build time or compile time phenomena, which basically means that during the build phase, they can do the 90% of the work, humans make some changes, and that's a huge, huge, huge value, because the reason why things don't scale at the enterprise is because there is either lack of enough developers or skills or drive or whatever. If AI agents can do things and make it so easy that you can build those, and then once it is approved, then we know what is running, then it is auditable, and you can also add steps and checkpoints, whatever that is needed, like for example, cursor generated code, but you want more logging, so you can add logs in between, whatever those things could be. So once you have that deterministic artifact that can run in production, so that's where I think the world is going to move towards, which is a compile time phenomena, and the runtime phenomena, runtime phenomena has to be deterministic, something that is auditable, debuggable, you exactly know what is happening. You should be able to see the logs and all that kind of stuff. At compile time, agents can play an important role because they can help with the reasoning and create the first draft where a human can participate with the agent to produce the artifact that he's going to run.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense. I mean, this is a super hot debate at the moment, right? I think we've everything from this AGI vision where it's like, no, this is going to be a fully agentic loop and it decides when it wants to terminate, decides what tools to use, and it's just, you know, you give you a credit card and let it run, right? And I I I personally agree. I don't think we're there yet. Right. The these most free-form agentic systems that we've seen, they they typically don't work yet. This approach of saying let the LLM generate the flow, but then freeze the flow once it works, I think at least in the short term, it's a much, much more programmatic vision. Also, basically, I think we can take a lot of lessons from what works in the human world. Let's assume every human is an agent. You don't allow every single employee in your company make autonomous decisions. No, some person at the top says here is the set of things that we are going to do. You can only do these set of things, and then so basically the runtime is pretty deterministic.\n\nThat most of the reasoning and agency and all that cool stuff is used, so LLM process re-engineering is a thing now.\n\nI guess that's that's fantastic. So what are you excited looking forward? What are you excited about in your space? You know, where I mean, AI at the moment, it's hard to predict what's happening in six months, right? But if you, you know, try to stretch your crystal ball to the absolute limits here, what what things do you think we'll see our 12 months out, 2 years out in your space? So we have been we have been um we have been debating and reasoning on this for for quite a period of time, and maybe my answer would be slightly controversial uh because, you know, different people have different views of what would be the future. So I do believe that AI will continue to improve and the capabilities, and I think they will play an important role in compile time, building things, reasoning, and all that, although runtime is going to be much more deterministic and predictable and controllable. Now the question is, what is going to be the execution pattern? There are two different views of the world. One is that does it make my data management problem easier, that it allows compile time, move all the things into one place and be able to answer and do things, or you basically keep the tooling and the world the way it is, siloed everywhere, and AI would become smart enough to have multi-agent communication where each agent can do things and figure out how to how to, you know, if one makes an error and affects how to do the communication. So uh we we have been working on this idea of federated AI execution where how you can as an organization, you can define these thousands of agents in a very federated way, but dynamically are able to discover other agents or through some platform or whatever that that could be, and then able to communicate. So if you give a bigger goal, somehow they basically you don't need a one central person to decide everything, dynamically all the agents can discover, they all can share the capabilities, then you can figure out the control path, they can then you can figure out how to run. So we are trying to build a federated decentralized automation framework, which basically means that can I take any process in any organization and figure out the federated decentralized execution framework and that can run and and that's where where I I believe that automation world would move. There are still a lot of open questions, a lot of unknowns, a lot of work to do. Yeah. Uh but the bet that we are taking is that AI will drive automation in a significant way.\n\n\nRPA would be fully eaten by AI automation, and the future is likely going to be more of decentralized, federated execution.\n\nMhm.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so that's that's that's that's one hell of a vision there.\nI'm uh I'm excited about it.\nSo AI is progressing very rapidly.\nHow have sort of the technical advances of AI impacted what you can deliver to your end customers?\nI mean there must be changing basically constantly.\nIs that right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo I think the earlier we focused primarily on the unstructured data problem as part of the automation because that's one of the long tent in the poll is how do you even understand them because once you get data in the structured format you know how to do next steps.\nSo we primarily focused until now which is if you get bunch of unstructured data how to get you the things that you need to make the next step of the decision.\nWe did not touch the next step of the decision.\nLike let's say you are a lending company or you are an insurance company.\nOnce you get all the data, you might have to, you know, trigger some other tool like their lending system or some sort of fraud system or whatever the risk system and and things like that because that requires knowing about those systems, how to interpret the results and all that kind of stuff.\nSo we are like data in, we will do everything, give you valuable data out, and after that you are responsible for all the other integrations.\nAnd the way these guys solved those problems was by using this technology called RPA.\nYou might have heard robotic process automation.\nSo robotic process automation is literally if human had to do something, you basically open some stuff, browser or whatever, take some data, put into some other system, click some button and all that stuff.\nSo it records that human clicks on that desktop and tries to keep repeating it.\nSo you kind of like get that automated.\nAnd the hard part that they had is you can't do robotic process for unstructured data because it's not it's not fixed, they changes so anything will be very very brittle, but if the things are exactly the same after that you can actually like record the screen and and and replay it.\nIt has been very very brittle.\nLike the problem with the RPA, even though they add value, uh I think there are some big players there, UiPath, automation anywhere, and many of them have reasonable, you know, massive market market cap now.\nWith AI, the argument that we make, and we might be wrong, uh is once the data comes out, which we are very very good at at that until that point, can we also start operating those other systems?\nNow this makes a massive assumption, which is AI will help us operate those systems and uh there are some interesting protocols that has come, which is model context protocol that allows you to dynamically discover capabilities, call those functions.\nIt has a ton of problems still, which is does all the system even support MCP?\nWhat if they don't?\nAnd they They sort of punted on authentication, but but we'll figure that out over time, then authentication, then how do you know if something breaks?\nOne of the arguments that we're making is that maybe in future as we basically go broader, can we do entire end-to-end workflow?\nSo once data comes out, do we have a way to plan and region during the compile time which AI agent can do, how to operate those systems, how to call them, how to get the data, then call some other system, if something gets wrong, how to involve humans, so create all that stuff during with AI agent during compile time and then extend our offering to do this entire thing end to end, like can RPA be fully replaced with AI automation?\nRPA had some you know stuff that is easier to solve because some user logs in, so it always runs in the context of the user if you're clicking on desktop and all that.\nOne of the hacks that we believe might work is called identity pass through.\nCan we assume the user identity that can be provided during runtime and then let that user identity get passed to all of the MCP?\nAlthough I mean do do I always want an agent to have the same capabilities that I have?\nYou know, like an agent is like um today like a good intern, right?\nSo I I I trust the intern up to a point.\nI don't necessarily want unlimited spending on my credit card.\nMaybe want to cap that at $50 or something like that.\nAnd you can decide that during compile time.\nSo basically you can say that like hey even if like let's say this this user context is with this, but as soon as it gets to this operating tool, maybe like we create some like user divided by half ident fake identity that will have less permissions or things like that.\nSo the good thing is, and that's why I said the AI agent should only be used during compile time so that it gives humans all the control that what the runtime behavior should be.\nYeah makes sense.\nThis problems come when AI agent is making runtime decisions because then you have no control where things are going.\nUh so the separation is critically important.\nSo during the initial build you can choose like if you want to curb what agency they have and what limits and constraint that they have and that's what it will it will go and do during the runtime.\nAll right, thanks for being here today.\nThat was absolutely amazing.\nI think we're we're on a very exciting journey, you know, with with AI and, you know, looking back, I think the last big wave that I was a part of, uh, you know, was was probably the boom.\nAnd I think if there's one lesson learned for enterprises in general back in that those days is that these big technological shifts happen, you have to jump on the wave early.\nIt may be complicated, maybe, you know, still a little a little weird, a little little, you know, your compliance, your legal folks, they don't know how to deal with it.\nBut you know if you don't, you may end up like Barnes & Noble, right?\nThe the the downside is is substantial and I think it's it is clear today that that there's a huge opportunity for enterprises here to both have more efficient workflows for themselves but also to have a a much much better end customer experience and and partner experience and in addition it does three things which is it saves you a lot of cost.\nIt does.\nIt allows you to do things much much faster.\nAnd the third one is fundamentally changes customer experience in a very significant way.\nSo I think I think there there are all the business reasons for enterprises to adopt these things.\nNow it's just about how to make this work.\nI don't think I have any question on whether this you know whether this will work or is this the right decision.\nIt's about how to make it work.\nThat that is the bigger question I think.\n",
