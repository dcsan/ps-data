  "cleanText": "AI is going to take over the enterprise.\nWe know this is going to happen, and it needs to happen to us faster than it happens to our competitors, which is a totally different dynamic than we saw with Cloud.\nWhat is the journey over the next decade?\nIt's about the speed at which humans can change their workflows.\nHow fast can somebody use a computer to do something?\nTo type an email, to write code, to generate a marketing asset.\nWhen that's no longer a limiter, how do these jobs begin to change?\nIt's so strange to me how many disruptions are happening all at the same time.\n\n[Music]\n\nAaron, thank you very much for joining us.\nEverybody here already knows you.\nHowever, I still think you should introduce yourself just for completeness.\nOkay.\nUh, Aaron Levie, uh, CEO, co-founder of Box, and uh, at Box, we help enterprises basically take uh all of their unstructured data or enterprise content and turn it into valuable information.\nUm, and AI is is absolutely this uh incredible accelerant for for that problem.\nI just learned that we're investors, didn't you?\nWell, many years ago.\nMany years ago.\nSo, uh, I no claims post IPO actually.\nUm, uh, Ben Horowitz had this um early uh kind of blog post on basically, I think it was the title, \"The Fat Startup.\"\nYeah.\nUm, and yeah, in response to the lean startup, right?\nAnd we uh, let's just say we very much took that to heart.\nUm, and we uh, we basically like deployed every single lesson, which was like the name of the game is you get big fast, you scale aggressively, and um, and that was that was a very important kind of period in in our company's journey.\nSo the the the notional topic of this is AI in the enterprise.\nUm, but I think it's good to be kind of nuanced about this because it's less obvious than people think.\nAnd you've been talking a lot about AI on X, but also, you know, you're thinking about it in the terms of your business.\nSo, let me just kind of set up the first question as follows, which is what's, you know, AI has historically been this very B2B Enterprise thing like chat bots or whatever, you know, um, personalization systems.\nBut what's unique about Gen AI is a lot of the use cases are actually like consumer or proumer, right?\nThink like creativity or developers, and it actually hasn't made intros as much into the enterprise yet.\nIt's just starting now.\nYep.\nSo maybe just a couple of questions.\nFirst off, like a, does that match with your experience, and then b, how are you thinking about, you know, this transition to the enterprise?\nI think if you were to like do the idiosyncrasies of AI and then reverse engineer why that was the journey basically up until, let's say, pre-chatb moment, AI was extremely hard to use.\nIt required in many cases having custom models for basically every problem you tried to solve, and so there was almost no way that a consumer ecosystem could flourish, you know, based on that.\nIt was not, it just was not generalizable enough.\nThere was really few products other than like maybe Siri, Alexa, etc., that you'd interact with that would even have some sense of AI.\nUm, and so enterprises were the the, you know, early adopters of AI systems to bring automation and and workflows uh to to uh workflow automation to their um companies.\nThen boom, ChatGPT happens, and all of a sudden it's the exact right form factor for mass adoption.\nThere's no startup costs.\nIt cost, you know, 2 minutes to 2 seconds to learn the product.\nYou just, it's a chat interface.\nSo it was like perfectly ripe for just taking off in the consumer space.\nUm, and and then, you know, you have uh also these incredible conditions uh set up for mass adoption.\nYou have billions of people on the internet.\nIt was set up as a free product.\nUm, again, it it kind of solved this sort of latent kind of question mark that everybody had, which is like, when are we going to see AI, you know, touch work and touch our lives?\nAnd so everything was kind of like the perfect conditions to to get mass consumer adoption.\nOn the enterprise side, um, you you you have, unfortunately, kind of the opposite, right?\nYou have you have lots of workflows that have been kind of ingrained for decades and decades.\nYou have lots of legacy IT systems that have data kind of not set up well to be accessed by AI.\nUm, you have a sort of shadow IT problem, which is which is most corporations don't want, you know, end users just injecting, you know, text into prompts that might contain information that the AI models could learn off of.\nSo it's sort of a difficult environment for that same level of verality with the exception of a few of these proumer categories.\nUm, I'm, you know, I have talked to large corporation, um, you know, CIOs that are seeing people just show up with Windsurf and Cursor and Replit, and so you're getting actually this sort of shadow IT version that we saw.\nDev tools has always been devol had that.\nYeah, 100% fair, 100%.\nDev tools have had that.\nUm, but I think that you're you're still seeing that now in chat, the ChatGPT kind of leakage into organizations.\nI'm sure their consu their their proumer inside of a corporation firewall usage is off the charts, even even separate from the people that pay for it.\nTotally.\nUm, so now the question though is is like what is the journey over the next decade for the real change management of deployment of AI systems that drive the more like GDP changing productivity gains, and that that's something where I do think we have to be prepared for.\nThis is many years.\nIt's about the speed at which humans can change their workflows as opposed to how kind of quickly the technology can just, you know, sort of evolve and advance.\nAnd so we in Silicon Valley, and certainly anybody tuning into this sort of imagines like, well, why doesn't the breakthrough that we just saw get released?\nWhy isn't that, you know, permeate every corporation within 6 months?\nAnd it's because like people just like have meetings, and they have budget, you know, processes, and they have to go through a governance council, and they have to get compliance on board, and they have to figure out like who has the liability when the when the thing recommends this stock, and then they, you know, the financial services provider shares that with a client, like that takes years, and there's going to be case law that needs to happen, and we still have lawsuits that are going on about who owns the IP of this stuff.\nSo, so that that part is going to take years.\nWhat what's interesting, and I think you'll you'll especially appreciate this on the Cloud side, is um, I remember when we first were scaling up in the enterprise, let's say 2007, 2008, 2009, you know, let's say that 3 to 5 year period post AWS, post kind of Cloud starting its journey basically to a te, every conversation you'd have with a CIO or a group of CIOs was basically like, yeah, that's nice, maybe some little corner of our organization could use this.\nWe are never going to go fully to the Cloud, you know, they had their arms, you know, wrapped around their servers.\nI remember.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd and and basically they did not want to give up the infrastructure.\nThey there was too many questions, too many compliance issues.\nThere was, you know, just job, you know, existential job questions of like, well, what happens when this, you know, gets delivered as a service.\nHere's a super interesting.\nLet's say we're now two years into two and a half years into the ChatGPT moment.\nThat same group of CIO conversations, none of that.\nIt is basically assumed.\nIt is is basically fully assumed that AI is going to take over the enterprise.\nUm, like the CEO, the CIO, the CDO, every job, every, you know, org leader is basically like, we know this is going to happen.\nThis is not a, this is not like a we're trying to kind of push it off.\nIt is purely a sequence of events.\nWho do I deploy?\nHow do I deploy it?\nHow do I drive the change management?\nIs the model ready?\nSo what's really interesting is I think the level of buy-in you have now in the enterprise is like five times, you know, greater than we had in the early days of Cloud, and you could even see it like the to me the classic litist test was um, if you remember like 15 years ago, I think Jamie Diamond was probably most famous for saying like, we're never going to go to the Cloud.\nYes.\nSo like they basically said Jamie Morgan will never go to the Cloud.\nYeah, you know, today that equivalent commentary, whether I don't have a perfect JB Jamie Diamond quote, but David Solomon at Goldman Sachs has given this anecdote of they can write now an SEC filing or an S1 for an IPO in like a few minutes that used to take a number of analysts, you know, a few days.\nAnd so the fact that they're like those are the anecdotes already coming out of the biggest banks means that we're not in like a like a fear of AI world.\nWe're in a we know this is going to happen, and it needs to happen to us faster than it happens to our competitors, which is a totally different dynamic than we saw with Cloud.\nSo do you think this has implications for companies today that are building products that are, you know, pre-API or pre AI products?\nSo for example, with the Cloud wave, you know, you basically had a bunch of Cloud-native companies that ended up, you know, taking over, right?\nLike so for example, Snowflake is a great example of this, which is like the ones that, you know, decided not to go all in and were hybrid, like hybrid kind of became known as like means it won't work, right?\nLike, you know, anything called hybrid like hasn't worked, and they have to do that.\nSo, so do you think because the buyer and the enterprise is more ready that like companies that are pre-AI have more of an opportunity, or do you think that, you know, you're going to see the same thing with a lot of like AI-native companies do?\nWell, I I'm going to basically give you the non-answer of I think both.\nUm, and one benefit that that the Cloud cohort has or the SaaS, you know, kind of post like us all understanding and agreeing on what SaaS would look like.\nWhat we all have is we were we whether whether we lit, you know, adhered to this perfectly or not, you know, is a question, but we basically all tried to build API-first platforms.\nYeah.\nAnd so, um, or at least like API kind of like equal platform.\nSo we have the UI and we have the API.\nAnd if you think about it, like AI and AI agents are like the perfect, you know, consumers of an API, right?\nAnd and so they basically become these super users within your system on your APIs.\nSo So if I had to just say, okay, I want to I want to deploy agents to go and automate my ServiceNow workflows, I think I'm I'm better off just deploying the ServiceNow agent to go do that than do an entire reinvention of my ITSM system to solve that use case.\nAnd you could just go down the list, like Workday.\nIf I want an AI agent to do some kind of HR related task, I think I'm better off to just do that within Workday than I am building an entire new system.\nSo, so you have a bunch of different factors versus the pre-Cloud days.\nLike pre-Cloud to post-Cloud was an entire rewriting of your software.\nYou had to go from single tenant to multi-tenant.\nThe scaling of the systems were totally different.\nEven the functionality and application logic was different because like, well, it should be real time.\nIt should be collaborative.\nIt shouldn't be as as sort of async and batches as the on-rem systems were.\nAnd so in a Cloud world, it's it is a reinvention of the user experience and what what you're doing in the system.\nWe should you know, definitely get to that.\nWell, I just I want to make sure I tease this out because this actually it's a very interesting point, which is so your claim is is to go from pre-Cloud to post-Cloud, like that rip through the entire stack all the way down to like the infrastructure, for example, like tenency, like you have to rewrite everything, and then what you're saying about AI is more of a consumption layer thing, which is like you just kind of like treat the existing systems as they are, and then like, you know, the AI becomes the consumption layer.\nYeah.\nDo you think this is like a 1.5 step and like the 2.0 step kind of rips through the entire stack or Okay.\nSo, so let's let's bookmark that one for one second.\nSo, so, but like if you if you do pure Clay Christensen sort of, you know, approach, you you know, sustaining innovation, disruptive innovation, disruptive innovation is this thing that looks like so much harder, so different, so less profitable.\nSustaining is like actually no, I'd like to build that because it's just like it's incremental.\nIt's it's better for our business overall.\nThe on-prem guys had a disruptive innovation.\nEverything about the the business model of SaaS looked different, harder, stranger.\nI I don't have the talent.\nI'm running I'm running a service delivery operation as opposed to I ship you, you know, a CD ROM with my code, everything go to finances and pricing model, everything everything the business model, everything.\nAI again with the bookmark being the like the really big disruption that you could contemplate right now with AI, everything kind of looks like a sustaining innovation if you're an incumbent, which is like instead of a user pressing the buttons in the application, let's have an agent run through the API and operate as if they were that user, and so all of a sudden for a lot of SaaS providers, this looks like TAM expansion because now for the first time ever I can actually deploy my software for use cases where the customer didn't have users on the other end before to do those things.\nSo I think you have a lot of TAM expansion.\nNow the good news with one caveat, which may maybe we've bookmarked and we're going to get to, but let me just say the one the one caveat is you now have a component that has a very different COGS model if you're a software provider.\nAnd so like now it's almost like it's almost like when we went from like onrem to Cloud, we went from perpetual to recurring.\nAnd it feels like with AI you kind of have to go from recurring to usage based just because yeah, I I um, okay, so so business model will will shift for some of the use cases because even if you look at the cursors, replets, you know, windsurfs of the world, there does seem to be this baseline seat price and then and then your consumption usage thing is there to this add-on, and so and so, you know, SaaS providers are kind of well well structured to be able to have that kind of dynamic.\nUm, if it was 100% usage and the and the user seat goes away, I do agree.\nThen you have this then you have a little bit of a business model crisis.\nOh, so you think, but right now it's not clear that that's going to go all the way over.\nWell, until you until the human literally is not a seat on the system, I I think you don't remove the end user license as a\n\n\nComponent.\nOkay.\nAnd but again, that that could be like the much bigger disruption.\nYeah.\nNow the the um just just to you know, fully lay out though the the market dynamics, I think SaaS incumbents are especially, you have a couple other idiosyncrasies right now versus the on-prem days.\nAnother idiosyncrasy is, I would say, like on the margin, you tend to have founders still leading the SaaS companies, and so that's a great point.\nWe didn't really have that in the on-prem world, and so you like, like, seable already had three CEOs later, and PeopleSoft already had multiple CEOs later.\nSo it was a different leadership structure in these organizations.\nA lot of time you still have the founder around, they're poking around, they're really into AI, so so there can be an a more natural pivot of the company from from the leadership standpoint.\nSo bunch of different factors now to the benefit of startups, which is why I'm actually, I can I can hold both of these in my head, which is I'm very bullish on the SaaS incumbent being the natural place for that AI agent relative to that category.\nI just think we have this incredible expansion of categories for the first time that we haven't seen in probably 15 years.\nSo the SaaS 1.1 wave.\nActually, it it actually expanded the software universe where we had these new categories of software that we didn't expect before, like nobody would have predicted the confluence and the snowflakes in in in the pre-on-prem days.\nWe didn't have all of these different cuts of of how do you work with data, how do you do this workflow, how do you do that line of like lines of business didn't have 15 different applications they got to use.\nPost SaaS they did.\nSo for startups in the AI world, the equivalent of that is I think there's a lot of of categories now where there's no actually software incumbent in that category where AI agents all of a sudden let you go build software for that category: legal, healthcare, education, and so on.\nSo that's definitely true on the consumer side, right?\nIf you look at the top use cases of OpenAI, it's almost like the top of the pyramid of needs, right?\nIt's like creativity and fulfillment and like, you know, etc.\nRight.\nI think like number five is like professional coding, but everything above that is one of these.\nSo on the consumer that's very clear.\nIs that is that clear on the enterprise side?\nI I I absolutely think so.\nI think if you looked at just just take um if we did a snapshot 10 years ago of the size of the uh contract management market or the legal document market, it's like sub two billion.\nI'm making up the numbers.\nIt could be plus or minus billion.\nYep.\nYep.\nWould you agree that in five years from now the AI agent related spend on legal services should be in the many, many billions to double digit billions?\nAbsolutely.\nOkay.\nNo question.\nSo all of a sudden there's like not these natural incumbents that were like, oh, we we captured all that market.\nAI agents all of a sudden expands the size of the software related spend in that space.\nSo I can underwrite that for healthcare, legal, consulting services.\nI think there's entire areas of financial services, like we always think, oh, finance has been wired up for so many years, no banking, you know, like, you know, consumer banking has been wired up, trading has been wired up, investment banking never went digital, wealth management never went digital, like these were not categories where where you ever had like major software platforms to help these entire categories of the economy, and and the reason was because the work was unstructured, it's very ad hoc, dynamic, lots of unstructured data as opposed to stuff that goes into databases.\nAll of that is now ripe for AI, and that will then largely be ripe for many startups because there won't be a natural incumbent in those spaces.\nI mean, it's so strange to me how many disruptions are happening all at the same time with AI, right?\nI mean, if you think about like everything you said, which is basically vertical SaaS or vertical use cases, which a lot of that is actually human budget, right?\nThat's being disrupted.\nThere's a bunch of new use cases that we never really thought about before, which is like the creativity and you know, I mean, who would have thought that 2D image would be some massive market, but it's a massive market, right?\nTurns out um you know, I've I've been a programmer for 30 years, right, and in that time, like software would disrupt other things, like we disrupt all of these things, but we never got disrupted, but like clearly like we're safe, we're screwing you guys, but clearly now software is being disrupted, right, for the first time like I've ever seen in 30 years.\nAnd so like, do you think this level of disruption is something that existing companies will not, like maybe a more fine point, you are a business leader right now, you have to think about product and you have to think about your organization.\nDoes it require you to have to think about too much, like how do you structure your company as well?\nHow do you structure your product, or do you think like this is actually all pretty manageable?\nUm, I think your R&D, literally, like I'm putting myself in your shoes, right?\nWhich is like your CEO, like your R&D is changing.\nYou're like every part of the stack is changing, like everything.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI uh I think the reason that I'm probably frankly more distracted by what we're building that I don't have enough time to stress out about the actual organizational side because I'm stressed out enough about just literally like the actual pure like delivery of the product.\nI think if I had a little bit more time, I'd get more stressed out um about all the other change.\nUm, we we are very much leaning into the idea of being AI first.\nUm, we we, you know, we have a twofur on this, like one by being as AI first as possible, we'll see the use cases that our product should go solve for customers.\nSo like check that box.\nAnd then second is like I'm just a believer of the efficiency, productivity gains.\nUm, and I do think it does change basically everything about, you know, work in, and there's lots of these interesting examples of what it means, like so in the future, does the individual contributor basically become a manager of agents?\nSo that's a totally different job, right?\nLike, like that, like my my recent kind of go-to is just thinking about it as like a lot of the productivity your organiz of your organization was rate limited by just like literally like how fast can somebody use a computer to do something, to type an email, to write code, to generate a marketing asset, when that's no longer a limiter, how do these jobs begin to change?\nAnd it's like, okay, your job is now orchestration, you know, integration of work, planning, task management, reviewing, auditing, and and that will, you know, that will radically could change work.\nInterestingly, there's it probably behooves us to not over rotate on transforming yet internally for any given company simply because the techn is changing so fast that like you probably wouldn't want to snap the line right now, run your whole business on this technology because in 2 years from now it's going to be so much better.\nAnd so I think progressively figuring out which workflows have high impact upside, getting it rolled out in a decentralized way so people can experiment, like I think you want to do a few of those kind of things first.\nJust I mean, I can't imagine a listener not knowing what Box does, but just for completeness, maybe can you just talk just very quickly about what do Box does and how you're thinking about how that dubtails with AI?\nYeah.\nSo um we started the company on a really with a really simple premise, make it easy to access and share your files from anywhere, and we we pivoted about two years into the journey to focus on the Enterprise market, and the whole idea was enterprises are a wash with all this, you know, unstructured data, so corporate documents, research files, marketing assets, uh M&A documents, contracts, invoices, all of this, and as companies move to the Cloud and as they move to mobile, they need a way to access that information, they need a way to collaborate securely on um they want to be able to integrate that data across different systems.\nSo we built a platform to help help companies do that.\nWe have about 120,000 customers, about 65 or so% of the Fortune 500.\nAnd so what's incredible right now is we've had this ongoing problem since the creation of the company, which is with structured data, the stuff that goes into your database, you can query it, you can synthesize it, you can calculate it, you can analyze it.\nY your unstructured data, the stuff that we manage, you create it, you share it, you look at it, and then you basically kind of gets forgotten about, like it goes into some folder and you almost never see it again.\nAnd and maybe you kind of find it once every 5 years for some task you're doing, but that's about it.\nAnd so most companies are sitting on most of their data being unstructured and getting the least amount of value from it relative to their other, you know, structured data.\nAI is basically the unlock.\nSo AI lets you finally say, okay, we can ask this data questions, we can structure it, so we can take, we can look at a contract, pull out the 10 most important fields, once we have all that data, we can analyze that information, we can get insights from it, and then you can start to do things like workflow automation that was never possible with your unstructured data, so if I want to move a contract through an automatic process, I can't do it if I don't know what's in the contract, and the computer previously was not able to know what's in the contract, so for us, there's just a huge, huge unlock of now what you can finally do with your information and your content.\nSo, we're building an AI platform to handle all of the kind of plumbing, user experience uh to make then your content AI ready effectively.\nI don't want to be like too bullshitty and provocative, but I have to I have to ask this, which is um I've been enterprise software for a very long time.\nA lot of the business model is predicated on the fact that like building software is hard and takes a long time.\nYeah.\nLike to what extent do you worry about that not being the true going forward?\nLike do you think we enter like this time of bespoke software being upon us?\nUm, I'm I'm I'm bearish on the on the uh extreme version of that um of the essence of that.\nSo the extreme version of that, if you just, you know, if you imagine the polls of this, like the extreme, like, like, you know, on one poll, basically all software is prepackaged, it, you know, it's the Ford Model T, it's going to work only in one way, everybody uses the same thing.\nOkay, like that's not going to happen.\nWe get that.\nThe other extreme is like everything is just like homebrew.\nYou wake up in the morning, you utter something, you get your software for the day, you give your software for that thing, and then like the next day you do it again and you change it.\nOkay.\nThe the downsides of that model of why basically I think it doesn't work is I think if you ask like 90% if you ask the world population, you know, you probably find that 90 plus% just don't care enough.\nThey just don't, like they don't care about the tabs on their software and the modules on their dashboard.\nLike it's like they want someone else just to be like, this is what you should look at in the morning.\nThey don't want to have to even prompt the AI to tell them what to look at.\nSo given that that's basically guaranteed to be where 90% of the world, no matter what you, no matter how you cut anything.\nGreat point.\nThat means that basically 90% of our software should largely be like, okay, you log into the HR system and it just like looks like an HR system.\nAnd in in fact, you know, there's another interesting dynamic, which is like over many, many years, our software and our actual way that we operate companies have kind of like there's this, there's this flywheel relationship between them.\nAnd so like the way we run our HR department is like not so different than the way Workday wants us to run our HR department.\nAnd it's like fine because like that's not the area that we're going to have a lot of upside innovating on.\nAnd so and like the way that we do our ticket management from customer tickets is like the way that Zendesk like decided to do ticket management and like and that's fine because like that's not the core IP of the company, and so I think most in in a way it solves an operizational problem for you, like you don't you don't have to figure it out, like no, and that people miss that about software.\nIt's like I don't want to have to think about the workflow of an HR payroll process, like I just want the I just want the software to do that.\nAnd so that's what people are buying.\nAnd so nobody wants to customize those things.\nNow again, given that we're going to be in this world of many different outcomes playing out, the reason I'm still bullish on Replit and vibe coding is for a different category, which is like I'm the IT person and I just like have this crazy queue of tasks and then someone's like, can you build a website for this thing?\nCan you like code up some in inventory rand random plugin for this product?\nIt's like that now becomes 10 times easier.\nSo the new prototyping, scripting, kind of like the long tail of stuff that and that long tail is so long and people never get to any of those things in that long tail.\nAnd so I could underwrite a 10x growth of the amount of custom software that gets written and the fact that these core systems don't go away because there's just actually going to be way more software in the world that gets created.\nLet me pressure test this.\nSo like, okay, so I I can imagine why it would be hard to rebuild Box because like what you do is actually hard.\nLike this is core infrastructure.\nYou store data, like that's really important, and so like I don't think you just vibe code that away, but from my perspective, a lot of SaaS apps just look like CRUD to me, like CRUD is, I don't know what the acronym stands for, but it's basically you're reading and writing data from like a back end, and so do you think that there is a world where the consumption layer evolves to just using AI and this class of companies go away, or do you actually think, if I heard what you just said, that the durability of these companies is it it basically teaches you what the workflow is?\nWell, I'm still going to say the latter.\nUm, uh, now I don't know if if you need to bleep it out, but if you want to share a couple examples of who you put in the not hard CRUD layer, then then we could like parse that.\nBut, but up to you.\nThe not hard CRUD layer.\nYeah.\nI mean, I would say most vertical SaaS companies, I see the technology is trivial.\nYeah.\nBut, but the understanding of the domain.\nNo, no, this is what you said before.\nThis is what I want to present.\nThe thing is that's actually a great insight.\nI like I I um I've always I've always been I've always underestimated vertical SaaS relative to the outcome and like like 20\n\n\nYears into doing Enterprise software, I'm just like no longer going to underestimate vertical SaaS. It's not about the technology. It's the fact that somebody else has figured out the business model that works and like, like they have like 10 people from the pharma industry that is like sitting next to the engineer being like, \"This is how you should do the clinical trial, you know, workflow,\" and that becomes so much of the IP. Now that translates fine to agents, but I still would then bet on that play, that vertical player doing that as opposed to somebody prompts their way into ChatGPT to build an FDA compliance agent. I would, I would still largely bet on, you know, complianceagent.ai to do that over the pure horizontal system that has no particular domain, you know, kind of expertise for that.\n\nUm, and then I think the other thing on the, you know, you also, I still think that there's a relationship between some amount of GUI and the agent and the APIs because again, like you don't want to every day of your life go to a blank, empty screen and say, \"What's our revenue today?\" Like you just want a dashboard at some point and just like shows you the revenue. That's right. Of course, like, like, and so then, then it's almost like cache queries in a way, like, like somebody has made the decision of like, like this is like a known way to like solve this problem in the Enterprise. And so I think that's why the, the, the theory of like the full abstraction away from the interface and it's all an API call, I don't think that happens. And, and so ironically, probably what will happen is in a couple years from now, we will see agents like rebuild entire web pages and dashboards, and then we're going to find ourselves like, \"Wait, why are we having an agent? Why do I have to spend tokens to create a thing that is a config on a dashboard?\" And like we'll just be back to where we started for some amount of software, which will mean that basically like these things are going to live together.\n\nCool. Let's move from software to decision process. So, uh, I won't say the name of the company, but I, I just spoke with a very, very legit company, household name, where, uh, it's a private company, though it's not a public company, where at the board level, for every decision, they ask the AI for like, like basically, uh, more information for the decision, and they were like, \"This has actually been great from, like, that's funny, from like discussion fodder to be provocative,\" and it also shows how like fundamentally unoriginal the board members, like this founder was telling me, he's like, \"It's literally better than half of my board members,\" right? And so like, how much have you thought about bringing AIs in to like help with decision process? Yeah. And by the way, I think the board is like low-hanging fruit because boards tend to not have a lot of context to the business and so kind of like the instance are probably less anyways. But is this something that you've thought about or, um, well, the board one is an interesting one, so maybe we can, we can, uh, unravel that one. The, um, well, like I already use it for, let's say, our earnings calls, where we'll do a draft of the initial, uh, earning script, and then I mean, again, because Box deals with unstructured data, I just load up the earning script and I'll use a better model and say, \"Like, give me 10 talk, give me 10 points that analysts are going to ask about this and like how would I improve the script?\" And it just spits out a bunch of things and it's, and how, how good is it at predicting? Oh, 100% because, because, but the thing is, like, that's not surprising, like, like it has access to every public earnings call in history. So, and like at the end of the day, analysts can only ask you like tailwinds, headwinds, what, who's buying what. It's not because analysts are smart or not smart. It's just like those are the things that like you would try and deduce from an earnings call buying a stock and you wouldn't have thought of these questions beforehand or is it just like a margin on the margin? No. So, so sorry. So, so what I'm using is, is then the specific parts of the document that is missing the answers to those questions. So I can actually inject the answers into that. And so, and so like you add, so because like, you know, you're typing out a thing and I forgot to give two case studies in this section or whatever. So it's, it's a quick way to just do, do some analysis on something.\n\nThe, um, but yeah, I mean, you know, it's funny, we, we, uh, uh, so Bezos, you know, famously had this memo-oriented, essay-oriented kind of meeting structure, and, um, we never did that, but I was always fascinated by the companies that, that could do it, and actually, we're, we're entering a world where probably you could just pull that off, right? So if, imagine if, whether it's a board meeting or product meeting, you just do a quick deep research essay on the topic, like, obviously every meeting, every strategy meeting in history would be better off if you probably had that as a starting asset to get every. I think the argument against that would be the reason Bezos said it is because it forced people to think clearly about what they're doing and writing it down. So the exercise meant the people walking in the meeting had more context. Yeah. This would almost argue that they would have less context because something else did the thinking. Well, well, two things. The, the, it was, uh, it was to make sure that the person doing the thing had the clarity to write it for sure, but it was also still to inform everybody else that could, that didn't do that work, right? And so it certainly would have helped everybody else in the room. And I'm not 100%. I mean, we should do a full longitudinal analysis of like the people that wrote the essay, did they actually have the better products or like, like, I mean, there's some Amazon products I don't like, and so did they obviously wrote an essay also for those. So I, you know, I don't know the hit rate ultimately on the essay specifically as much as the idea of like, write down a strategy, think it through, and so why not have an agent do like 90% of the heavy lifting. So a lot of my, my workflows are like, if I have a topic where like, like maybe the direct change of my workflow on this front is is the kind of thing that three years ago I might sort of lob over to the chief of staff and say, \"Hey, can you like go re-research like the pricing strategy of this ecosystem or something?\" That's just a deep research query now and then I'll wake up and but what does now tasks their trade-offs, I just do it for the most random things, which means like I'm expanding and exploring way more spaces mentally than I would have before. And these are the kind of, you know, parts where like, like, and and this is equally why I'm like actually more optimistic on the jobs front because what we, we do too many times with an AI is we like look at today's way of working and we're just like, \"AI will come in and take 30% of that,\" and it's like, \"No, no, no, we'll just do totally different things with AI.\" I wouldn't have researched that thing before when it was people required to research it because that would have been an inane, you know, task to send to somebody. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSo what one thing, so when we run the numbers, and by run the numbers, I mean, look through how AI companies are doing, where does the value accrue? There's basically one takeaway, and that is like these markets are very large and growing very fast and value is kind of accruing at every layer, everything from like literally chips up to apps, right? Everybody, you know, and so like the only real sin is zero-sum thinking to be like, \"Oh, like the models are not going to be defensible,\" or whatever your zero-sum thinking is, that just hasn't proven. Now, this is still largely than a consumer phenomenon. So like what, what I've been thinking about, and I don't, I don't have an answer. I'd love to hear your thought is, is when it comes to Enterprise budgets, like you can't just create budget out of thin air. So like you actually do have a limited resource, and so as budgets get reallocated, to what extent do you think this is like zero-sum, like the old budgets gets robbed versus like budget accretive, or like how do you think about that because again, like where we've come from, that has not been an issue. I think in the Enterprise, it probably will be. So it does have to come from somewhere, fully, fully logical. Um, couple things. Yeah. A large number for startups can also be a very small number for a large corporation. Yeah, of course. So, so you have that dynamic playing out. Um, uh, like I, I'll make up random stats, but you could probably take a meaningful engineering team and and probably for the price of five of those engineers or 10 of those engineers, you could probably pay for cursor licenses for the entire engineering team.\n\nThis would argue that it's actually coming out of headcount. So here's where the, here's where the, um, asterisk is. Yeah, there's an infinite ways, an infinite set of ways. This is why like you can never take a point in time snapshot on these kind of things. Totally. There's an infinite set of ways that this actually plays out. Yeah, next year's planning process, maybe in, in a perfectly, a, you know, like parallel universe, the, um, uh, salary increase that year would have been 3.5% for employees, and this coming year it's 3% because we're going to take .5% and we're going to deploy AI, you know, for the company, like there are so, or maybe next year we're not going to add, you know, we would have added 50 engineers, but we're going to add 25 and then pay for AI, but guess what, the year after those, we're going to engineering productivity gains. So increases because it's still competitive environment. We then now add engineers the year later because we're getting higher productivity gains. I, I think that that, that most companies of any regional scale, post 100 employees, let's say, have, have enough sort of dynamism in the in the financial model within a one to two-year period. This is so where it doesn't look like what the economist would think it looks like. So can I, can I just spit this back? I think this is actually a very good point that that's buried in there. Just want to make sure I'm following along, which is like the software license cost to a startup relative to like a large people organization is relatively small. It's just a couple of headcount, which if you just look like normal performance management, normal attrition, normal like variability and and and even like hiring timelines is kind of in the noise. And so like, you know, you already have an annual budgeting cycle to fix that up. So like basically within the noise even of just like headcount planning, all of this could work out without like some massive disruption. Totally, and there could be an upper limit of this point, but but let's just, okay, let's say, let's say the going rate in Silicon Valley of a new engineer coming out of college, let's just say it's somewhere between 125 and 200. Okay, I'm just making up. Okay, let's say your, let's say your most aggressive cursor usage or something is like a,000 bucks a year, 2,000 bucks a year. So you're at like 1% salary maybe. Um, and that is just not, that's just like, like here's the question, like again, do this like crazy, you know, apples to apples thing. If you, if you went and recruited from Stanford right now and you said, \"Okay, you Stanford grad have a choice. You can work at this company and get paid 125k. Yeah. or you with no AI, or you can get paid 123K with full access to AI. Which one are you going to do?\" They would do the 123 all day long. Yeah. Yeah. But even, but even that, you're just Yeah. I mean, like your argument was, which makes a lot of sense to me. It's kind of on the margin when it comes to like total, but but just as a way of exploring like why these things are not the high order bit of of the cost increase on budgets. No, I love that. That's great. And like if you, I, I did, uh, I did one kind of late night sort of like modeling once, and it's like, I'm, but I'm, I'm afraid to say all the numbers here because I think they're just going to be so wrong. But something on the order of like five or six trillion in knowledge worker headcount spend in the US. Yeah, everybody says for developers, they say, they say 40 million. Let's just say it's 30 million. Let's say that the average is 100k, you're at 3 trillion. These are just massive, massive numbers. So it's many trillion. Yeah. So, so you have many trillions of dollars. If you take a couple percent of that or 5% of that, you're already doubling the entire sort of US Enterprise software spend. So, so that is like that you can just make it work within, and this is why I don't think people, people will not make cuts because they have to pay for AI. They might make cuts for other reasons, but even in those cases, I think you'll often have it be for myopic reasons temporarily. Yeah. And there's enough flexibility to basically consume this and then actually like recap on the productivity. I think that's great. You, um, yeah, you're like I, I try and parse everything you say through through the lens of like where are you landing on like on you know, AI coding, and you seem to have a very pragmatic view of where things actually are at. Yeah. Where, where are you landing right now?\n\nWell, it's been an evol, so I would say in the entire AI thing, the biggest surprise to me is how effective it is at code. Yeah. Um, and so my sense is, so I'm just going to say a couple of like, you know, I think facts and then we can kind of back out what this means in aggregate. So I think one fact is the reality is, is I do think that AI helps better developers more than not better developers, and the reason is you just have to deal with and be able to like know what to ask for, know how to deal with the outcome. So I think that's one. Um, uh, someone said it, I thought beautifully, which was, you know, this is a very good developer, and this was on X, I forgot who it was, but I thought it capsulated. He's like, \"You know, 90% of like what I know, the value of it has gone to zero, but 10% has tripled, more than 10x or whatever it is like that, 100x.\" I think that's exactly right. Um, I do think that for a lot of wrote use cases, the AI can do it and it doesn't need to be double checked, right? So there's a lot to your point, like things like prototyping, things like scripting, like, and so you know, I do think if you look at usage of like OpenAI, um, like if you actually look at the, the code usage is it like the primary use is actually professional developers, which means it's part of a developer workflow, and then, and then probably the most controversial stance I have is, and and this is probably like sunk cost fallacy because I've been a programmer for, I mean, like my PhD is in\n\n\nComputer science, like you know, so maybe this is cost fallacy, but I just don't see a world where you get rid of formal programming languages just because they arose out of natural languages for a reason. Like, we started with English, and then we made programming languages so that we could formally describe stuff. And so, like, it'd be kind of a regression to go back. So, I still think we'll use languages, and maybe they'll change, maybe more like a scripting language, but I think, like, the existing tool set will evolve, but it'll still be a professional developer. Like, I think we'll still have developers, still have developer tools. So, that's kind of where I am. I would love to hear where you're at.\n\nNo, I'm, I'm, I fully am in the exact same page. The, um, the fun, the fun thing to me is the, is how the, uh, coding is just at the tip of the kind of iceberg of, of then you, you know, it's like the best, it's, it's the best thing to first get you know, sort of experience agentic automation. Um, but I think you'll see this in basically every other space. But it, what's so fun is just in a one-year shift, let's say, of, of, like, the nature of the relationship with the AI. So, if you think about, like, the GitHub co-pilot moment was like, \"Oh, this thing is incredible. It's going to type ahead and and predict what I'm typing, and then, and then it's, you're basically using it to work 20 or 30%, you know, faster.\" And which, which, you know, uh, which parts of it do you do you take on or not? And you know, now the relationship is, is like totally different within, again, a year or two period, where you're using cursor, winds surf, or whatever, and the agent is generating this chunk of, of an output, and then you're just reviewing it. And, and that, the, but what's what's incredible is, like, none of your expertise is any less valuable in that review. In fact, it's, it's, it's probably even more important than ever before because you're going to get in some cases, like, it'll, it's just going to be, like, wrong 3% of the time, and then you review it, but then you're literally doing 3x the amount of output. And, like, the, the nature of how that changes both programming, but just ev, like, why not have, why not have that for basically everything is sort of this, this new way that both software should work, and then actually we will work is, like, is, you know, we were like, the, the big joke, you know, a year after chatbutt is, like, okay, this thing generates a legal case, and it's like, wrong 10% of the time. And it's like, well, actually, hold on, like, that's not, like, if you think about what this, like, the new paradigm of work looks like, that might, like, sure, it should be 1% of the time. But the job is you deploy a task, it generates a thing. Yeah. It comes back. You should expect that it's 2% wrong. Yeah. And then your job is to go and fix its errors. And, and it's like such a, a weird inversion of it used to be the AI was fixing your errors. That's what we thought the AI was going to be. And it's, and it's just like a totally, total flip. It's like the human, the human's job is to fix the AI errors. And that's the new way that we are going to work. Right.\n\nSo, this, this begs a very obvious question, but I'm going to work up to the question. So, there is a great, uh, paper in NSTI from an MIT team, which basically says you can optimize a running system with agents. And the way they did it is they, they basically had, like, a, a teacher agent, and then, like, more junior agents. And then the more junior agents would go try a bunch of stuff, and of course, they had much more knowledge of the literature than, you know, any single human being. So, they try all of different things to try it, and then the one at the, you know, the, the, the senior agent would say, \"Oh, this is good, this isn't good.\" And then, you know, once it optimized the system, they would do it. And then, of course, the person that was running, you know, like, the, the human being is then kind of, like, helping the teacher agent decide, like, what are, what are the parameters, what is good, what is not good, and provide high-level direction, right? And so, you're already starting to see, um, you know, cases where human beings are running multiple agents. And even that already is starting to have some kind of bifurcation, which one way to think about it is in any R&D organization, of course, people start as, like, IC's, but then they very quickly get interns and go into management. And so, maybe we're just skipping that step. So, the obvious question is, is what happens to entry-level engineers? Like, does this change how people get introduced to computer science, for example?\n\nThe cool thing is probably more people will even now get introduced to computer science. So, um, because you'll be able to, anybody can learn, anybody can learn it. And, and, like, uh, you know, it's been 25 years for me, but, like, in the early days of, like, programming basic applications or putting other websites, it was just extremely frustrating that you would spend, you'd spend, you know, days and days being, like, why does that thing not work? And it was, like, and, like, I had not, I have very few resources of, like, figuring out why the thing didn't work. It would have been a hundred times easier if I could have had an agent write the thing. I would have learned, I would have learned 10 times faster being, and, and, and honestly, what you did is you, like, well, not, not 25 years ago, but 10 years ago, you go to Stack Overflow. And so, it's like the slow version. Yeah. But so, think about how many people missed the window pre-Stack Overflow that got sort of pushed out of the ecosystem because they're just like, \"This is too frustrating.\" And so, you're going to have a way bigger funnel at the top of, of people now learning, uh, programming, computer science. I think, you know, a similar percentage of people will, will fall out. So, it's not like, again, you're going to get a 10x increase in, in programmers because you still have to enjoy it, and you have to like solving problems and and whatnot. Um, it's going to change the nature of, of the incoming class of engineers that you hire. Like, like, they will literally not be able to code without AI assistant assisting them. And it's not 100% obvious that's a bad thing because, assuming you have internet and the site stays up, like, we should have access to the agents. So, I think it's mostly, mostly just, like, we have to adapt how we think about the role of an engineer and and what these tools are are giving us in terms of the, the productivity gains. Um, I'm actually, uh, like, I meet with a lot of, like, like, larger, not tech-oriented companies as customers, and generally the thing I'm recommending is, like, hire a bunch of these people because they're going to flip your company on its head of, like, of how much faster the the organization can run. So, I do understand, I want to be sympathetic to the job market for anybody coming out of college because it's like, I don't think it's easy right now, and and it probably hasn't been easy in a number of years. Yeah. But if you are graduating, the thing I would be selling any corporation some way or another is that is that, like, if you are AI-native right now coming out of college, the amount you can teach a company is unbelievable. And then, in, you know, conversely, if you're a company, you should be actually, like, prioritizing this talent that is just, like, why does it take you guys two weeks to research a market to enter? Like, I can do that in deep research and get an answer to you in 30 minutes. And, like, and just everything can, they, they, they will be able to show companies way faster ways of working.\n\nDo you think there's any stumbling into problems this way, which is, like, you kind of adopt too quickly and, like, you you get into a morass you can't get out of, or you think at this point it's pretty clear the stuff can be practically consumed? Uh, what would the, what would the morass be that you'd get into?\n\nYou, you hire a bunch of vibe coders, and then they create something that nobody can maintain, and it's really, like, totally, which, by the way, I will say, I have seen this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, okay, you, there's a, you could easily overdo this whole thing. Well, um, you, you could very much, uh, I, I think, I think, uh, as with anything, like, like, uh, deploying these strategies in moderation while we're all collectively still getting the technology to work better and better is super important and understanding the consequences of these systems. Um, so, um, so yes, this is not, like, a moment to just, like, have your whole company vibe code. I, I will say one of my favorite things that I'm witnessing in the whole coding thing, and I don't know, we're, you know, like, the point of this talk is kind of AI in the Enterprise generally, but, like, the coding thing is just so, so, so, uh, salient is that a lot of the these OG programmers that I've known for a long time that are off creating companies or CEOs of public companies, like yourself, are all back to programming. Then you talk to them, and I, you know, many of them, like, I code, you know, uh, most nights with cursor just because it's really enjoyable. And the reason I didn't code before is 'cause, like, I just couldn't keep up with the frameworks. I'm like, \"Dude, you got to, like, I don't know how to install the thing, and, like, what is this Python environment stuff, and, like, like, I just didn't, you know, it's just, like, you had to learn all, and, like, you're literally learning bad design choices that somebody else just made up. Like, they're not fundamental to the laws of the universe. They don't make you any smarter. It's just, like, waste of brain space.\" And so, some way, the AI just gets rid of this kind of crusty stuff that you probably shouldn't be wasting brain space on anyway.\n\nWell, the, the, my, so, like, the, uh, the amount of frustration I have when I look through, let's say, our product roadmap. Yeah. Um, let's say pre-AI, although this still obviously happens because we haven't fully transformed everything about how we work, but pre-AI, when you would see things like, \"We have to upgrade the Python library in this in this particular product,\" and it's like three engineer, two quarters. Exactly. And, like, at the end of that project, zero customers will notice that we did something. We, we resolved some fringe vulnerability that is, like, not going to even happen, but you have to do it because there's some, there's some compliance thing where you have to make sure you're on the latest, you know, version, which is super important, but, like, the thing is never going to happen. And all of a sudden, like, you are are wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars of engineering time. And the fact that, like, that's now, like, a codeex task is just unbelievable. And the amount of, like, the amount of, of just now things that you, you can actually relieve your team to go and work on is incredible. And the other big, like, boon for, for, uh, the economy, and this is again where the economists just totally missed this stuff, is think about every Small Business on the planet, of which there's millions, tens of millions, whatever. Yeah. That for the first time ever in history, they have access to resources that are somewhat approximate to the resources of a large company. Like, they, they can do any marketing campaign. Did you see the NBA finals video for from KHI? Um, the V3 video? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like, you can now put together a, an otherwise million-dollar marketing video for a couple hundred bucks of tokens. And, and that being applied to every domain in every in every service area. I can, I can run a campaign that translates into every language. I can, I can, you know, have this longtail of bugs that that I never got around to auto automatically get solved. I can have the analysis of a top-tier consulting firm done for my particular business. So, for the, the people or companies that that are resourceful and and are, you know, creative and and imaginative, the access to resources right now is just, like, truly, like, just unprecedented.\n\nWhat do you think is the best metric for anybody interested in tracking this stuff as far as, like, how fast it's going? Is it, is it GDP? Is it margin? Is it topline? Is it headcount growth? Is it all the above? Um, how do you, how do, like, how do you measure it?\n\nYeah, I mean, for us, so, internally first, and then, and then maybe the macro, maybe, like, we'll spitball some macro solutions to this. Internally, spec, uh, we've actually explicitly taken this stance that we want to use AI to increase the capacity and capability of the company. So, just do more, like, and then, and forever, anything that you track, just make sure happens, like, just, like, do more or do faster either in a given time period. Yeah. And, and so, that somewhat relieves the pressure from people that, like, this is about cost cutting. It's just, like, no, no, just, like, do more right now. Like, let's figure out what works. Some things won't work. We want experimentation, so just use AI to do more. Okay. So, that's us. The way you should measure that then in a couple years from now is either the growth rate of the company should be faster. Yeah. Or the amount of things that that you know, we're collectively doing should be more. And the only reason that that wouldn't show up in growth rate is that every other company also does more, and so that gets competed away, which is, like, also a very viable outcome is, like, this is just the new standard of running a business. But there's, there's no, there's no shift in the equilibrium, right? There's no shift in the equilibrium. You just have to do it. And, and then the ultimate product of all of that is some other kind of metric of satisfaction of, like, our products get better, like, could be, like, consumer price index or something. Well, but, like, did did the iPhone show up in GDP? I don't know, but my life is better with the iPhone pre than than without the iPhone. I'm pretty, I'm pretty sure it did. Okay, fine. So, but, like, it would show up then, like, you know, it would ultimately then show up in, like, new cures to diseases, better healthcare. Like, I don't know that the dollars would move around all that differently as much as just, like, like, life expectancy should go up, like, cost of housing should go down, like, weird metrics that productivity gains will then drive that the economist wouldn't, you know, naturally associate to, like, Enterprise software and AI. I, and this is, by the way, this is where I am, which is, like, clearly there's a disruption because marginal costs are going down in a bunch of stuff, like, writing code and language reasoning and whatever. And, like, some companies will take advantage of that, but I don't think, like, the fundamental equilibrium changes. I think, to your point, I think we just, like, do more tech, you know, products get better faster, we solve problems that we haven't before, but, like, it's not, it's not asymmetric that we've seen in in other, yeah, the way I kind of think about it is, like, I, you know, if we go back to, like, 1985, and we just, like, looked at how everybody works. Yeah, I think we would just be totally stunned by how slow everything is and just, like, like, how long did it take you to research a thing?\n\n\nOr analyze a market, or analyze it, or create a campaign, or whatever. And it's just like, but like, it just has now been baked into our human productivity that we just do all those things really fast now. And so, in 10 years from now, when we all have AI agents running around, we will just look back to today and be like, \"How did we function?\" Like, you spent two weeks to decide the message for the marketing campaign? Like, how is that possible? Like, what we do now is we run 50 experiments with AI agents. They all come back with versions. We look at them all together, and then we make a decision in an hour, and we move on. Like, that's obviously like how work works, and like that's what we will be saying in 10 years from now.\n\nDo you think we'll ever saturate the consumer?\n\nUm, and I, by the way, I caveat this by saying this comes up every one of these inflection points, and so I just wanted to ask it again for the umpteenth time. I think, uh, I'll say yes, just because at some point, maybe, but like, my list of purely consumer demands has not gone down. Like, healthcare is like a totally unmet 100% need that I have. Like, I do not like to go to doctors or dentists or anybody because of just how hard it is to get scheduled. I mean, buying a car, man. Like, there's so many things that just need to be sold. The cost of housing, we clearly don't have enough houses. Like, now, where will AI, you know, drive that? Okay. So, you know, maybe that's, that's, well, maybe robotics would be then the play there, but like, but like, I don't think we're anywhere close to like consumer satisfaction or satisfying all needs of consumers.\n\nWell, I, I actually, I meant a more like, well, things change so fast that like, it saturates the ability to adopt new things. I do think that that is, uh, that that is certainly possible. Um, I think I track sort of, let's say, my parents as a decent kind of, you know, kind of proxy, or even just friends, like college friends that aren't particularly in tech, and they're still like in their ChatGPT phase of adoption, and like, they haven't moved on from that. They're not making, they haven't made a video yet. Like, they're just like, they're just like using ChatGPT to ask questions about life experience that they have. And so, you know, maybe ironically, like, one of the problems was ChatGPT was so good that it like, has, it has like, you know, if you, if you like, you know, imagine what people thought AI should be able to do for them, it already met like 80% of where they would have, you know, sort of projected it. And, but when we know, actually, no, it can probably still do, you know, 10 to 20x more. Yeah. But their needs are going to be satisfied for some time on those core use cases. Yeah. So I think, I think for like the most basic consumer query type things. But then, but then this is the opportunity for startups, which is like, now AI will show up in sort of ways that maybe the person isn't even like in the market for an AI thing. They just want a better version of that. So this could just like simply be another market constraint is as soon as it saturates, you just make the product better, given like the existing. Yeah. And, and like, you'll just like, if I could just get better healthcare, but I don't need to think about that as an AI problem, or not an AI problem, but AI will be behind the scenes delivering that, then I don't think you're saturated anytime soon. Yeah. It's just the consumption, the consumption, the consumption capacity just becomes another market constraint. But there's a ton of other ways that you can improve things.\n\nThat's great. Great. I love that you're so optimistic about...\n\nI am. Uh, I'm, I'm, uh, I think 98th percentile optimistic. So good. All right. So I think we've had a fairly pragmatic conversation about like the current impacts and the near-term impacts. If you do a longer view, can you dare to guess what things look like in 5 to 10 years?\n\nOr I think, um, uh, so Sam Altman and Jack Altman had a podcast recently, and very good. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, you know, paraphrase probably, you know, in some wrong way, but like, they were going back and forth about how like, we, we just got, you know, what we would have predicted as AGI five years ago, and it's just like, we use it, and it's like, and like, it's now built in the most antilimactic climactic antilimactic unit. And I think that's my instinct for a lot of this is 5 years, 10 years, whatever your number is. Um, we should, and this is why I'm so optimistic, is like, on, on just society and jobs and all this stuff, is like, I don't think it's the Terminator kind of crazy outcome, you know, scenario of we automate away everything. I think, I think the human capacity for wanting to solve new problems, for creating new products, for serving customers in new ways, um, uh, for delivering better healthcare, to try and do scientific discovery, like all of this stuff just will, is just like built in, and it will continue. And AI is this kind of upleing of the tools that we use to do all those things. And so I think that the way we work will be totally different in 5 years or 10 years, but you're already seeing enough of probably what it will look like that I think it's an extrapolation of that. It's when you want the marketing campaign done, you have a set of agents that go and create the assets and choose the markets and figure out the ad plan, and then you have a few people review it and debate and say, \"Okay, like, let's go in this direction instead.\" And then you deploy it, and you're on to the next thing. And so each company, their units of output grow as a result of that growth. You know, we're all still in competitive spaces. So, so some of it gets competed out, and others will keep growing faster than they would have before. So they'll hire more people, and those will be, you'll have new types of jobs, like we'll have jobs for people just to manage agents, and like you'll have operations teams. You know, Adam D'Angelo had this cool role that just kind of got announced. Really cool. Yeah, the role is to work with Adam at Quora and figure out which workflows can be automated with AI. I think you'll have a lot of those kind of functions, but I think, you know, one of the exciting things about at least being in Silicon Valley, or anybody kind of tuning in, you know, being in this ecosystem, is like, we're seeing the change happen faster here, and it's going to be five or 10 years of this rolling out to the rest of the economy. And so I think, I think it's going to be, you know, we will spend the next 5 years making the technology actually deliver on the things that we're all collectively talking about, and it just to make it more and more robust, and the accuracy goes up, and the costs go down, and the workflows it can tie into are better, and we will be working on that for quite some time.\n\nAnd, and you think ultimately this leads to the biggest piece dividend of better products for users, better user experience?\n\nYeah, I think, I think the software gets better, our healthcare gets better, the life sciences discoveries increase. Um, I, I think it's all, it's all a society net positive.\n\nI love it.\n\n[Music]\n",
