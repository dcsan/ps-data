  "cleanText": "Will software in some way replace teachers?\nParents want better outcomes.\nWhat is actually improving retention of information, learning, memory?\nThey're allowing a teacher to be a lot more productive and be 10 times better at their job.\nWill we see more parents like, \"I want more of a truly AI-directed education for my kid?\"\nIt's teachers who are willing to kind of pay and use this in their every single day workflow.\nWe need the textbook companies to grow some innovation arms fast.\n\nI'm Justine and this is Olivia, and welcome back to This Week in Consumer AI.\nThis week we're going to be talking about a very fun trend we've seen recently blowing up all over our social media feeds related to AI and Education.\nAnd for this topic, we wanted to bring on our subject matter expert here at a16z on Education, which is our colleague Zach.\nZach, you want to give a little introduction and talk about your experience in edtech?\nYeah, I would love to.\nI think it's fun to feel invited to a podcast from colleagues.\nIt's interesting feeling for sure.\nYeah.\nSo, quickly just my background, um, been operating investing in Education for quite some time.\nSo, I've been here for a little over two and a half years thinking about what the next generation of Education is going to look like, uh, with the advent of AI, and then before this was at General Atlantic with one of my coverage areas on the consumer internet group being Education.\nAnd we were investors in Quizlet, Duolingo.\nWe did the chess.com deal while I was there.\nSo kind of the edutainment kind of consumerization of Education.\nAnd then before that I actually uh built and sold an Education technology company that was focused on delivering high school computer science Education uh in mostly the northeast area.\nAnd we sold that to actually an Education focused rollup.\nYou can count how many times I've said Education.\nUh where I worked for a couple years as well rolling up uh different assets in mostly adult Education and corporate training, and I know we have looked at a lot in edtech over the past two years especially.\nI think for sure everyone has this intuitive sense that people are using AI for homework, but even I was surprised like seeing some of the data for probably the full first year of ChatGPT, like the edu users were even larger than the everyone else who was a non-student user, which is pretty crazy.\nAnd it does feel like the backlash was also as severe and as immediate, like all of the anti-AI checkers.\nAre schools still anti-AI?\nLike how has that evolved?\nYeah, it's a good question.\nI uh we had like AI wave and AI detectors and kind of the Rockom Saka Wars of Education, and you had like the LA and New York City public schools banning AI right away.\nUm I think we're super far away from that moment, which I think is really, really strong now.\nNow I think we're in different layers of far away depending on where you are in Education.\nSo if you look at K12, there's still some skeptics.\nUm there's still, I would say, like predominantly, like I think 80% of districts now have like a generative AI team that's going after and looking at procuring kind of new technologies.\nSo not only is there like earmarked budget, there are people who are thinking and proactively looking for it.\nUm there's still, you know, friction around what you want to use it for and how you want to use it, and maybe there should be a teacher in the loop that has kind of more understanding of how Students are using the AI, and maybe that's a good or bad thing, but I think it's a good thing kind of net net net that there'll be more AI in the classroom.\nAnd then higher ed, like you have, you know, Claude releasing Cloud for Education, you have OpenAI releasing kind of Education platform, and they're partnering and piloting with like a bunch of universities, and this is like a pretty horizontal platform form that will be like fundamental to teachers and Students experiences.\nSo I think higher ed is leading the pack.\nUh I think they're realizing that this is going to be a tool that people are going to need to know how to use in their jobs and their everyday lives.\nSo I've been pleasantly surprised.\nI know, you know, 18 months doesn't feel like a, does feel like a long time, but in Education it's not.\nUh, you know, we've taken five, six years to move to cloud, and like most people aren't even there yet in the Education world.\nSo I think it's super impressive, and you know, there's some schools that are like mandatorying AI, mandatory AI usage like in the curriculum.\nI think Ohio State is one of them.\nSo uh I think it will continue to trickle down.\nI think people are always a bit more careful and wary about technology with the younger ages.\nBut yeah, I think we've passed the kind of hysteria moment, are now in kind of the pragmatic moment.\nUm which is exciting, especially for founders building the space.\nTotally.\nFor sure.\nYeah.\nAnd and I think you sort of alluded to this when talking about your experience in edtech, but one of the things that's so both interesting and scary about the Education market as more outsiders is like it's not just one industry, right?\nLike there's public schools, there's private schools, there's charter schools, there's homeschooling, there's supplementary products that Parents buy for their kids.\nThen there's the whole higher ed public and private industry.\nAnd then there's like adult Education, kind of future learning, reskilling, all of those sorts of things, which I would imagine is probably going to be huge in the age of AI, automating many jobs and/or enhancing many jobs.\nUm, I'm curious, have you seen the most adoption among a segment of that market, like Parents just buying standalone products for their kids versus school districts?\nI think I was really, I'm still really surprised that this is my answer, which is teachers.\nUm it's not actually Students, um it's teachers who are willing to kind of pay and use this in their every single day workflow.\nUm I've seen a lot of adoption at Students who are, you know, trying to use this for homework helpers, but they're kind of turning off or using it as a, you know, way to get their problem set done and then go back uh to kind of hanging out.\nUh and adult learners, like the retention maybe has been a bit better or like the completion rates or learning efficacy on Duolingo has like improved with like all the AI features.\nBut yeah, I have not seen kind of a native AI player in the adult Education space.\nAnd maybe that's just because distribution is really hard and layering on AI to existing strong pedagogy is maybe the right way to do it.\nOr it seems like that is the case now.\nBut with teachers, like the rapid amount of adoption is so high, and that's a lot of it is because like 90% of the job that they hate is the administrative part, which is grading, feedback, going home, building new assignments, new curriculum.\nUh a lot of them have like just been barring curriculum year-over-year.\nUh they've been trying to kind of iterate on one unit at a time, and now they can generate a curriculum per student, and I think that's just like it, it's, you know, extremely exciting.\nI think that like we hopefully will take it farther and it won't be generating kind of assets that we've already seen in Education, like worksheets or multiple choice questions, and like the units will start to become more of an AI experience.\nBut for now it's been teachers the wave.\nI think Magic School has over like 5 million users.\nI think 50% of US teachers have used their tool.\nUm, most of the most mature AI companies from a revenue standpoint have been selling to teachers bottoms up, which is tremendous.\nTeachers have a very, you know, small wallet to spend on tools, and this is just uh kind of an outsized return for them compared to the, you know, 15 or 20 bucks a month that they're spending on it.\nThis brings up another point when you think about kind of like what's driving Student outcomes, which is like there's a couple ways to look at what is working in AI and edtech, and one would be like what is getting the most usage, which to your point is probably still ChatGPT for the end Students, versus like maybe more focus products, and then there's like what is actually improving retention of information, learning, memory, things like that.\nHave you seen anything that you've been really impressed by in terms of like what's working in AI and edtech?\nYeah, I think like the core of the question is the question, which is like what is working, which is like what is, what does working mean?\nYeah.\nUm there's the investor side of what it's working, which is like what do you want to see when you're investing in a company, right, which is different than like the learning outcome side.\nAnd I think from the investing side, um I care a lot about looking at kind of retention and engagement.\nUh retention obviously because uh you have summer months, but you also have Students who come on with a test that they have in two days, and is the experience good enough that they capture them to work proactively on the app the next time, right?\nUh so you know, we look at metrics uh such as like cohorted engagement to see how Students are performing, things like that, or monthly retention, less so like the weekly or yearly retention, which I think could be kind of a red herring uh in this market.\nSo, I love looking at kind of like the weekly, like how many days in a week is a user using this uh on a cohort basis as the company grows.\nIs this starting to become part of their learning?\nUh, and I think that that is also a good proxy for how good the product is, not just how engaging it is.\nUh, because if a student is doing this to just get their homework done, I don't think you're going to see that level of engagement.\nYou're going to see it taper off around certain times, certain months, or be a little spikier.\nBut people who are seeing kind of flattening engagement of number of days per week, hopefully, you know, above four or five, given the school week, I think is exciting on the Education side of what's working.\nUm this is a really, really hard question, and I think it's probably privy to like a lot of different markets are kind of suffering from this, which is like what is the benchmark and eval function in Education, right?\nSo luckily Education, like it's not like a corporate job where it's like, oh, you have a, you know, ambiguous performance review and maybe you're doing 10% better, um it's there is like tests at the end of the year that measure Students performance.\nThe problem with that is like you need multiple years of Student testing because there's a bunch of variables there.\nSo one is like how do you figure out like what's a conditional, what's independent, what's dependent, all of that stuff in terms of like what's working in the school.\nUh but but on top of that, it's like AI is still at the periphery of Education, right?\nSo since it's at the periphery of Education, we don't actually know what the outside's impact is.\nIt's helping teachers create assignments better.\nIt's helping Students get homework done, but it's not like core to the schooling system.\nSo I think it's really hard to know learning outcomes.\nI think it has to be a mix between like the metrics of the the product and how good and understanding the founder is of like how to build kind of pedagogy and learning methods within the product.\nUh but I think we're still like a couple years away from actually understanding like, you know, what the learning goals are.\nThere's some papers that have come out um from various schools and universities that have shown like test improvements with like an AI instructed course or things like that, which is exciting, but again, these are, you know, research papers and case studies, these aren't kind of like, you know, full state or full nationwide studies.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo to get back to the point about making AI core to the educational experience, that kind of touches on one of the sort of viral social media accounts we've been seeing, and I'm sure anyone in the Education space, definitely you, Zach, has been seeing.\nI think it's literally called the future of Education.\nUh it's an Instagram account, it's run by this um woman, her name's Mackenzie Price, and she runs a school called Alpha School, uh which I believe is a charter school in a few states now, um and has had these viral Instagram videos blow up by showing how her school, they have two hours of classwork, I believe it is a day, and it's delivered via AI tutors, like this, these computer programs that are teaching kids at their level, and then they spend the rest of the day on sort of self-directed projects or or things like that.\nWould love to know your take as the Education expert, Zach, uh what you've heard about Alpha School or kind of kind of will it work to deploy AI like that?\nYeah, Alpha School is like everything I can ask for about what's happening in Education.\nWe talk about it, we opine on it, and then we have to just kind of sit here and wait for superintendents and district heads to buy single point solutions in AI every turn of the budget.\nAnd then over three to four years, we can have a narrative.\nI think what Alpha School brings us is what like any labs team would be bring at a company, right?\nSo it's like, hey, you know, the SnapLabs team is going to try out a bunch of new features and they could deprecate whatever features because they're moving fast and not deploying a bunch of resources and they have outside budget to go do this.\nThen let's see what works and what works we're going to take and what doesn't work we're going to deprecate and we're going to continue to iterate.\nI think Alpha School is doing that uh for private schools now and hopefully for public schools later, which is, you know, the tuition is, you know, $40,000.\nThey're super well-funded private school.\nThe parent and Student base is self-selecting into a group who wants technology in the classroom.\nYeah.\nUh these might seem like just small facts, but like all of these in amalgamation change like the outcome of what you know something like a school can do.\nYeah.\nUh and removes a bunch of friction to allow you to move fast.\nSo I think what Alpha School is showing us is like if you kind of turn full tilt on AI and Education and you bring it into the classroom and you're fine overspending on software, you're fine uh spending a bunch of money testing a bunch of different softwares, you can kind of figure out what's working.\nI think my takeaway here is this is a great signal for where technology is today that you know if you have the privilege to go test it out and figure it out, it will have outsized impact.\nI think they ranked like 99th percentile on a few different assessments.\nTheir Students are now like top one, top 2% in the nation.\nLike it is incredible outcomes, but again, this is like the lack of commercialization of a lot of this software.\nPart of that is like what does the integration look like?\nPart of that is just the cost of software.\nUm part of that is like the uh you know, software literacy at the school level.\nUh so I think Alpha School is, you know, net extremely positive signals.\nI think it's an incredible way to learn.\nUh it's leaning into\n\n\nA lot of the old ways that we've talked about learning, which is like self-discovery, self-learning, uh, very limited instruction, and it's working.\nSo, you know, I think public schools are, you know, looking at it.\nMaybe superintendents are saying, \"Well, you know, I don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars of a software budget.\"\nYeah.\nUh, but I think that's okay, right?\nLike we see software gets cheaper.\nUh, let you know, the Alpha Schools of the world test out what's really working, and those companies will really benefit from early partnerships from Alpha School.\nUh, and to me, it's like paving a way for a lot of companies to see what they're doing.\nUh, obviously from like a very privileged standpoint where Alpha School is interesting.\nYeah.\nI think the controversial question there, like when you talk about superintendents don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on software every year, they do spend that on teachers.\nAnd so, like the the controversial thing is, you know, will a will software in some way replace teachers?\nWill AI replace teachers, or will we still need a human instructor to be delivering the curriculum or or giving lessons to the majority of students?\nYeah, I think no or very long horizon away.\nUm, there's still a shortage.\nThere's still teachers who are, you know, swamped with work.\nUh, we've been now talking, you know, what we're talking about in in in the AI world for what consumers can do with AI and what even enterprises are doing with AI, like we are multiple years behind there.\nLike the biggest use case of AI right now is generating an answer sheet or a worksheet uh assignment.\nIt's not even like a unit in the classroom.\nAnd what I mean by that is like it's actually a really big nuance difference.\nOne of the reasons why I've had like a little bit of a hard time investing in these early Education companies is they're allowing a teacher to be a lot more productive and be 10 times better at their job, have feel like burnout is a lot lower.\nIncredible, right?\nReally, really amazing.\nBut it doesn't mean that the Students are interacting with AI in a learning environment.\nThey're actually interacting with the same asset that they would, and they're having the exact same experience.\nMaybe they're having updated worksheets.\nMaybe there's some like better memes or better references in those worksheets because the teachers can update it uh weekly.\nBut that's not a that's very different than like being in an AI enabled environment where you know you can take a history lesson straight from a blink's avatar and speak to them, have a detailed conversation, or you know, create your own world around what you think, uh, you know, you write a creative writing prompt and go create your own world around it or create a game around it.\nLike I think those experiences are far away from coming.\nYeah.\nSo I think my point here is not to not answer the question, but to say like we're so far away from even like AI teaching units.\nI think we're very far from AI teachers.\nNow, I think what will happen is like the amount of active teaching will go away because I think you can like have really good active teaching with AI.\nUh, but I don't think it's going to fully replace a human teacher.\nYeah.\nSuper interesting.\nI do feel like kind of on the opposite end of the spectrum from Alpha School, which is like very private, very high cost, is this explosion of like free, publicly available, what I would call edtech content, but it looks very different from like the prior best-in-class, which was like the Khan Academy videos that I learned math and other things on and that I love.\nThat open source animation package is called Madam, still around today.\nYeah, it's And now we have like people putting their textbook into Notebook LM and making a podcast.\nWe have You found a bunch of like TikTok videos that generate like Sydney Sweeney explaining this.\nYeah, there's this Instagram account called Unlock Learning.\nUm, and yeah, they have like every video they post gets millions of views, and it's like explanations delivered by like Deepfake AI celebrities of like math and physics content.\nI think particularly for the AP or IB exams.\nYeah.\nAnd it also has like diagrams and graphics that sort of walk you through the explanation.\nAnd I guess it just makes me think to what extent are we going to see standalone AI edtech products versus just new formats of and ways to learn that are kind of delivered across all of the platforms that we already have.\nH, yeah, I think it's a great question, and I've watched way more educational videos than I have in the last like four days than I've had in the last 10 years, which again is like a really good signal that like they're engaging.\nThey feel like brain rot content, but they're actually the complete opposite.\nYes.\nUh, so they have they like look, feel, sound are cut the same way, but they're teaching a really, really, really, really detailed topic and pretty technical topic, and like they're getting better.\nLike I remember a year ago it was like Taylor Swift teaching the Taylor series.\nSo this is the Taylor series.\nIt's a tool we use in math to turn scary functions into friendly polomials.\nAnd now, um, you have like Drake in conversation with Sydney Sweeney.\nSo if we square root it, we get the vector's length.\nAnd that guys and gals is why this expression gives you the length of a 3D vector.\nYeah.\nTalking about threedimensional shapes, like it is it is like getting kind of more better both on like the animations graphic side and then also the defects of the celebrity side, like it's all getting a lot more uh engaging.\nWhat I think is really interesting here and the thing to focus on was uh, I don't know if you remember as a kid, you were like, \"Oh, like Zach's a visual learner,\" or like Justine likes like, you know, audio, or Olivia likes to read and like marinate with her ideas, and then you kind of get boxed into like a type of learner, and that was considered like pretty progressive education was like, \"Oh, we know what type of learner you are, and we're going to like cater to it.\"\nThe problem is, I'm a visual learner for one thing, but I might want to listen to a podcast for another and read for another or watch a brain rot video for another.\nLike it just could be so many different things or do a hundred problem sets, right?\nSo I think what's happening now is like we're going to have like a kind of like factioning of like a bunch of different types of learners where depending on the topic and your understanding of the topic, you could pick whatever modality you want.\nAnd I think that's really, really exciting.\nAnd then also depending on how serious you want to get in the topic, like if you want to just be conversational around it and it's not for a test, then like maybe brain rot content is perfect.\nYeah.\nBut if you are taking like an exam that matters for your final grade, like maybe you want to generate a bunch of problem sets and then like listen to audio that explains your answers.\nRight.\nSo I think for me it's more, you know, I I don't know if any of these turn into individual companies, but I think what's really exciting here is like the mode of learning is going to be like the title of what mode of learning you are and what mode of learning like you're going to be like burdened, you know, it's going to be removed from that burden, and I think that to me that is like the most exciting uh aspect for Education right now, and I think like we're we're seeing it, right?\nAnd the the engagement of these videos are insane.\nI mean, this is not a brain rot video to be this is not Italian brain rot, like this very different.\nWell, even the V3 vlogs where it's like a day in the life of some famous historical figure, incredible.\nIt's fascinating.\nIt's like truly entertaining to watch, and I find myself like actually learning things.\nI think the hard part of that is like there's a few different companies uh that are doing really interesting things at the forefront of like AI and Education, one of which feels like what the V3 thing is doing, which like you can chat and have a conversation with, you know, Napoleon about history, right?\nThings like that.\nUm, but in order to get school adoption, they have to wedge in with these kind of like more rudimentary tools, which is like the worksheet generators and like student helpers and feedback.\nAnd then once you do that, it's not so easy to get people to use the other mode because it's a new form of Education versus, \"Hey, do the same thing, just do it 10 times better.\"\nSo, it's interesting to see like the stuff that engages us the most and gets me the most excited.\nEven if it's being adopted and paid for by the school, if you look at the usage of those tools compared to the usage of kind of the more rudimentary tools, it's extremely low.\nUm, so I think there's probably going to have to be like a large like PD movement here on like how to bring AI not just into your workflow, but into your classroom.\nAnd I think that's like a really big difference.\nYeah, it's kind of fascinating to think too about um, if you were to design the school system from the ground up starting in the AI world, like how it would be different.\nI one of the things that has really interested me about the brain rot videos is like for the first time it feels like it's um separating like what the content is and who is delivering the content, and then it's optimizing both of those.\nSo if you look at the comments on these videos, I'm sure we'll show some of them.\nIt's often people who are like, \"I was like a physics graduate student, and I got like a 4.0 at this prestigious program, and I'm like telling you guys this is like an exceptional explanation, and I've never understood this content better.\"\nAnd then so like you're kind of optimizing for like, \"Hey, this is how you explain, this is how you deliver the content in a good way.\nExplain it in a good way.\nMake it understandable.\"\nAnd then like here's the like brain rot celebrity, like this is a familiar voice.\nThis is her first video on top.\nExactly.\nThis is an interesting graphic or image to like bring those things together.\nUm, which I which we've pretty much I think only seen with the self-directed AI products today because the traditional schools, you can't really separate the content from the teachers is my understanding.\nYeah, it's interesting.\nI think the answer is like in my head is probably like the textbook companies kind of control this dynamic here a lot.\nUm, they are still the gatekeepers of a lot of content and what gets in and out of the classroom.\nNow I think it depends on like whether they run with this or not.\nUh, I think sometimes they view this as like cannibalizing their existing business.\nUh, sometimes they're like, \"Oh, this is extending our existing content, and we have like the single source of truth, and AI is really good at augmenting, but not net new creation.\"\nSo I I think like what what's going to happen is really dependent on like where the textbook companies and the, you know, the publishers spend the next kind of 18 months thinking about net new products, like are they going to partner with AI companies and the AI companies will get distribution, the textbook companies will get kind of uh really strong product and technology extension of their existing content that feels like it's slowly losing its value day by day.\nSo uh it's a weird kind of power dynamic right now, u but I think that that's kind of where we are.\nYeah, we need the textbook companies to grow some innovation arms fast or outsource them.\nYeah.\nLike Zach's on one side of the spectrum, which is like this is how the educational system actually works, and it's like very complicated, and in some ways it's like the health care system or the tax system where there's a bunch of annoying outdated stuff, but you can't really change it.\nAnd then I'm on the other end of the spectrum where I'm like, \"Blow it all up and have everyone be taught by an AI tutor like all of the time.\"\nLike if LLMs have ingested the whole internet, they've probably learned a lot of stuff, and they might even know what to teach us that teachers don't.\nYeah, totally.\nAnd I would assume that sort of the Zach perspective is more where we are today.\nBut I'm I am wondering, like, are we going to see a lot of people are basically reckoning what to do with their careers, what to do with their lives, what to do with their Education in the age of AI?\nWill we see more Parents um opting for something more on the second path that's like, \"I want more of a truly AI-directed Education for my kid?\"\nParents want better outcomes.\nLike they don't like that's that's what the reward model for them is.\nIt's like, \"Are we going to invest in technology?\nAre we going to invest in this tutor?\nAre we going to invest in this course that allows my child to be better off from a, you know, Education standpoint?\"\nI think like one of the most interesting pitches I've seen, and the company was super early, was uh an AI reading company which basically like sent kids books, and then they had AI teach the kids how to read, and it was mostly three to four year olds, and it was the promise was to get them to read at like a third grade level within three months.\nUh, and it was $500 a month, and they had a bunch of parents within the first two months sign up for this.\nNow if they can prove this outcome, I think they'll get a lot more parents.\nIf they can't, I think parents are like, \"Well, AI and technology maybe isn't the right way to do it.\nI'm going to go pay a tutor.\"\nI think the other side of this is also, you know, if you have the disposable income to spend $100, $200 an hour on a private tutor, the comp to using AI is a bit harder.\nAnd if the AI software is priced against that, then you have a little bit harder and more friction on the adoption curve of AI.\nBut if it's, \"Hey, my kids going to watch Netflix for four hours, or I can put them in front of an LLM that can teach them things and keep them engaged,\" then that's a very different conversation.\nSo I think it's very kind of socioeconomically dependent.\nI think it's very geodependent.\nI think it's very like resource constraint dependent.\nSo I I think there there's a future probably for a few Students to feel that way.\nYeah.\nUh, especially because like LMS can be controlled, right?\nSo like parents could say, \"Hey, I wanted to explain this way.\"\nYou know, if it gets easier to kind of control them even for nontechnical users, which it continues to be, right?\nLike, \"Hey, I don't want you to discuss this topic, or every question I want you to like show the mathematical equation and then like write the proof and explain it,\" like, you know, I think all of that control is really, really exciting for some parents, so I think we just have to figure out how to harness it and how to kind of benchmark it, and I think it could be a potential future.\nTotally.\nOkay, so I don't know, looking a year from now, AI edtech, like, first of all, what what do you think we're going to Is it a lot of progress?\nIs it a little bit of\n\n\nProgress? And then what would you like to see ideally?\n\nYeah. Oh, so much. Uh, in a year from now, I think we'll see a ton of progress on the higher education side. Uh, I think this is the year for higher education, this kind of next coming school year. Uh, how do higher ed use it? How do the large model companies work with education companies? Uh, the question of like, are the large model companies going to be good enough, right? Like, it's will there need to be kind of smaller application companies built on top of the large large model companies, right? Uh, I think that's one thing we're going to learn a lot of. I think we are going to in the next 12 months move from kind of the outside of Education, the use of AI just to make things easier, to like bring it into the classroom, whether it's like adding it to a discussion. I think a lot of the unlocks in voice in real time is really exciting. Yeah, uh, so I think the next 12 months will show us a lot. I don't know if it will necessarily like birth a massive company in Education. I still think it move. Uh, but I think Education will look fairly similar though, but I think we'll learn a lot as the market kind of matures. What I'd love to see from a consumer perspective is the first like fully AI teacher influencer. Not one of the Deepfake celebrities. I know they're super entertaining, but it would be kind of fascinating to see like what does it look like if you designed the most engaging but also truly informative teacher from the ground up. Totally. And sort of, I mean, and you alluded to this as well, Zach, like that might, like that there's probably not one teacher who's that for everyone. Yep. Like, you know, I might learn best from an animated dog, whereas like you might learn best from an actual photorealistic teacher. Um, and how we can create those sort of like adaptive AI-driven characters in real time who can deliver really personalized learning on each student's timeline, cuz we we sort of touched on this a bit, but I think one of the exciting things that schools like Alpha School are enabling is like you can spend as much or little time on a subject as you need to learn it, master it, and move on. Whereas in a traditional school system, you almost everyone is moving at the pace of their classroom. Like you're moving at the average pace of the 30 other kids. Yeah. And you can't really speed it up or slow it down unless you have an external tutor like you mentioned, Zach, that's several hundred an hour. So anyway, that's what I would like to see. More uh, more AI teacher influencers and um, more sort of apps that allow personalized learning speeds. Yeah. No, I think that that is it's the right push. The brain, the language models are good enough to teach. Like they really are, right? Like if you want to learn something, Chad GBT is a great place to go learn something. Um, obviously make sure everything they're saying is perfect, but uh, it's a great place to learn something, but it's a really not it's not really an engagement product, especially when you have to learn it and there's stress involved. So I think all of the kind of infrastructure around avatars, around voice, and everything you're describing, Justine, is going to actually unlock a lot around Education. I'm sure we'll unlock a bunch of use cases around kind of more engaging or less engaging things that need to be more engaging. Yeah. Right. Um, so I think it's interesting. We're at the moment where I think LMS are trusted as a learning partner. Now we have to build experiences around them that feel kind of native to how language models, how you interact with language models. Y uh, and native to the tools that are you know, one that we can build with AI today and two where Students are engaged, right? Which is like the brainard video is a great example of all of that. Amazing. Well, thank you for educating us all on this, Zach. This was awesome. Yeah, of course. It was great talking to you both.\n",
