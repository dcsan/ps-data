  "cleanText": "It's just as hard to build a small, inconsequential thing as it is to build a giant world-changing thing. You work the same amount of hours, and so you might as well go for doing something important. Social media has become the dog, and traditional media has become the tail, and they just get whipped around like crazy by all these, you know, by all these shifting memes. We've basically recreated the original fund one seven times. So every team is like the original Andreessen Horowitz. So we really have like seven Andreessen Horowitzes, but with common infrastructure, uh, you know, common LP relations, common brand, common culture.\n\nWelcome to a live private viewing of the Mark and Ben show. Our favorite married couple in venture capital. Yeah, old, to be clear, old married couple. Yeah, that doesn't get along that well. The romance is long faded.\n\nThis is what we all came here to see. Um, Ben, let's talk about the evolution of the firm. You recently said that the VC industry has changed more since the inception of the firm in 2009 than in the prior 30 years. Let's talk about how our firm has evolved alongside that. What's been our act one or act two, and where are we now? Yeah. So, Act One, um, you know, and we were walking into a VC that hadn't changed, and one of the key things about it, if you looked at venture capital, um, it was the only asset class that had the same managers persistently being at the top. So anything else, you know, kind of rotated out every five, ten years, you know, the best mutual fund manager would change or the, you know, the best uh bond manager, whatever, um, best real estate guys. But in venture capital, the same firms that were the top firms in 1978 were the top firm in 2009.\n\nAnd the reason for that was, um, the top tier firm got first pick on every deal. And so the whole thing that we faced walking into that was how do we get to the top tier because otherwise there was no reason to be in the business because you wouldn't get any returns. You know, the same teams get the number one pick in the draft every year.\n\nAnd so our idea, you know, that was the goal, and we had, um, you know, we were coming from product companies. So we looked at it through the product lens, and we said, okay, venture capital is a really good product, top tier venture capital is a really good product for LPs, but a really kind of mediocre product for entrepreneurs. And so we thought about, you know, being entrepreneurs, we had been customers of venture capital. We knew what the product was. It was you get a very smart person uh on your board. Um, they have very interesting things to say for your first five times you talk to them, and then you've heard it, and so that they, you know, we're like, okay, that's kind of underwhelming, given how hard it is to build a company. So we create, we, our idea was to create a platform, um, that enabled a founder to evolve into becoming a CEO. And there were many parts of that, but a lot of it comes down to, you know, what makes you uh, you know, feel like a CEO, what gives you the confidence that you can actually run a company when you don't know how to, and you know, that became the networks that we built, like how can you, how can I call any CEO, how can I call any executive, how can I, you know, get to the US government if I need to, how do I feel like, you know, I've got a network like Bob Iger, even though, you know, I just started a company and I'm an inventor. And so that was kind of how we went about constructing the platform. And then the other part of it was, okay, is there somebody who knows how to do this job that can help me? And uh, you know, we brought in a lot of CEOs into the firm. And then, you know, of course, I uh, wrote the the book on like, okay, this is how you do it and so forth. And so that was the original product. And then because we, you know, because we were used to like, what do you do when you have a product? Market it, and that turned out to be a completely novel thing in the industry. And so that, that was kind of phase one, and that's what got us into the top tier. Um, phase two was based on a paper that Mark or an article that Mark wrote called software is eating the world. So in venture capital, you know, from its inception, and Andy Rackcliffe did this, this wonderful study where he showed that, you know, there were 15 companies in any given year that will ever make it to 100 million in revenue. And the whole game was to invest in those 15 companies. So ideally, you'd have a firm of maybe six to eight investors that would look for those 15, and that would be sufficient. Uh, and you know, and and that was very true. And by the way, that's the right size conversation to make high quality investments. You need like kind of a small team. Um, but if software was going to eat the world, then there was going to be 150 or 200 of these companies. And in order to deal with that, you had to be able to scale the firm. Uh, and that meant, okay, if crypto was going to be as big as software used to be, or you know, AI info was going to be uh, as big as software used to be, or you know, etc. If every vertical was that big in terms of the potential returns, then you essentially needed that original firm addressing each one of those markets. And in order to be able to do that, and this is where we just ended up having an advantage that I think that we didn't even really uh, understand at the time, but when we started the firm, um, we had shared economics like every firm does, but we didn't have shared control. And that gave us a giant advantage over every other VC that had shared control because if you share control, you can't scale because if you share control, you can't reorganize. And it's a subtle thing, but every CEO understands it. There's no way to scale if you can't change roles, responsibilities, the way the firm is structured, how it works. Um, because that'll be an everlasting negotiation because you're literally redistributing power across the organization.\n\nBut since, you know, we kind of have a single decision point on that, um, it was very easy for us to reorganize, and we were able to scale and basically field the best team, and so our competitors, and then if you look at the top tier firms that were with us in 2009, none of them got to crypto in any real way. Um, they, you know, they're trying on AI, but they're way behind. Uh, and they definitely, you know, and they mostly missed American dynamism entirely. And it's just because they couldn't reorganize. So like you need, what do you need if there's a brand new field? Well, you need, you know, new leadership in that category. You need new people on that team who know how to do that. Uh, and that means a lot of change. I think going forward, the way we're thinking about it is the goal now becomes, okay, if we're funding the majority of all the best new technology companies in the world, um, what, you know, what do we have to do from a leadership position? Um, one, we've got to make the regulatory environment conducive to being the best, you know, for America being the best in the world. Um, two, you know, we actually need our own channel, um, and you know, which you're coming on to build for us. It's really, really important uh, to have a voice and a way to distribute that voice, um, that is not only the biggest in the industry, but one of the biggest in the world, and you know, we feel like we've got a super social media, um, podcast star on our team already. Um, he's like way better than Joe Rogan or anybody else. And then we have, as you've seen, like a lot of kind of other people who are super compelling and who you'd want to listen to all the time. And so now we're going to, you know, mostly you're going to try and convert that into uh, something that can be long lasting. We're looking at other things. You know, we talked a little bit about, okay, how do we extend this American dynamism to, you know, American and her allies dynamism and take it internationally. And so that's how we're thinking about the, you know, the next phase. Yeah, the um, it's fascinating just to echo the point about the ability to sort of reorganize and restructure. One of my first meetings in with with you guys about potentially joining the firm was with Katherine Boyle, and we were talking about Mark, the conversation that you and Katherine had around the meme and being able to move quickly around the meme that that spreads. Why don't you talk about that? Yeah. So, well, so yeah, so the information environment, right, yeah, is is like highly fluid. We have this whole, we have this whole theory, um, you know, so you know, the media environment used to be relatively slow. If you go back hundreds of years, you know, it took, took days or weeks or months for information to get out, and then you know, cable new, you know, lots of changes happened that ultimately like cable news brought about the 24-hour news cycle, um, and everything sped up, and you know, political operations got this these rapid response teams that you see now in these war rooms and so forth. Um, you know, the new form of that is actually the social media controversy. Uh, Marshall McLuhan had this famous uh, thing, the great media theorist, he said, if it's on television, it's a television show, um, and so, it doesn't matter what the topic is. It doesn't matter if it's the Clinton, Clinton, Lewis scandal or the OJ scandal or like whatever the hell it is or some celebrity thing or nuclear war or whatever. If it's on TV, it's a TV show. And and it gets back basically packaged up by TV producers as a TV show. And and you see this, by the way, whenever anything happens, you turn on in, and everything now has a theme song, you know, war in the Middle East.\n\nUm, and and then you know, anything on television goes through the moral arc of a television show, right? Right. And so they, they, they want to go through these kind of moral arcs, the same moral arc that you see on like a television drama. They want to apply to real life. And so, you know, there's shame, and then there's redemption, and there's this and emotion and the interpersonal relationships and, you know, the soap opera aspect and and and all this stuff. And so, so we've been, we've been living, you know, those of us who've been on on planet Earth for, you know, more than 20 years or something, have been living life basically in this extended television show. Um, so extend McLuhan's idea to what's happened now in a social media dominated landscape, which is if it's if it's on social media, it's a post, right? Right? So, if it's on social media, it's a tweet, right? Or it's a Tik Tok video, right? Um, or it's an Instagram photo or something like that. It's it's a post. And so, what do we know about the social media? What you know, what what's the sure equivalent of social media is, you know, it's it's a it's a controversy, right? It's it's a blowup. It's a dust up. It's a what would the kids call it? It's a dunk of a dunk. Yeah. It's like it's like a dunk that leads to Yeah. Is it backlash? Um, and then Yeah. And then and then a mob forms and then there's scapegoating, right? And so, it's it's it's this thing. Um, it's this predictable pattern. So, so basically, and and the problem is like we all get pulled emotionally. We all get pulled emotionally into these things, and so it's hard to objectively observe what's happening. But if you can kind of lift yourself up a little bit for a few weeks and watch what happens, it's like every new thing that happens basically now has a two or three day arc. Um, and it's basically like, and you can literally graph it because it's like this blow, it's like this viral moment where something just like goes like parabolic, and and it's just like at that moment, we call this the current thing. It's just like it's like the most important thing in the world. It's like just like the most important thing, and literally it's just like whatever happened today. And then basically what happens is it's a chart like that, and then it's basically this falloff, you know, it's like a half-life of a drug or something, right, where it's like this two or three day collapse, and and and then basically that, you know, social media show, the social media shows two or three days, um, and then, you know, the the mob goes around either finds a scapegoat or it doesn't, and it kind of goes through a cycle, and then, you know, routinely two or three days later, it's just like, boom, there's a new thing like that, and it's like the most important thing again, the most important thing that has ever happened, and um, I've always wanted to build, um, I've I have friends who tried this, and I I want to build, I want I want like the internet weather airport, right? And it would just be this, it just be this constant, you know, it's just like, you know, hurricane after hurricane after hurricane of these things coming in. And so like that, that is the media environment that we live in. Um, and you know, you you can either as a participant in kind of the narrative formation shaping process, like you can either choose to be part of it or not. Um, and so part part of it is like you, you know, you have to be in the mix, and you you have to be if and if you're going to get a fight with people in that environment, like you have to be able to fight kind of in that context. And then and then I think the other thing that you know, Erik is really good at is the other part is that just leads to like, I think adrenal fatigue, right, which is like the human psychic and lyic system can only go through so many panic cycles, you know, it's like for the first five, it's like really exciting, and then you know, after a thousand of them, you're just like, my god. Um, and so that's led to the rise of this other thing that's happened, right, which is the long form, right? The long form podcast. And and this is the really remarkable thing that's happened is, you know, like the cliche is, you know, everybody has burned out attention cycles. But the the other side of it is the three, four, five, six hour podcast. Um, and and what's amazing, by the way, about it, if you talk to like, if you talk to like, you know, Joe Rogan or Lex Fridman or whatever, you know, they, they get these stats from YouTube about completion rates, and like it's an inc, they have incredibly high completion rates. Like a very large number of people watch those things all the way through. through. And so there's this other side of it, which is people are hunger, they're hungry for a substance, I think in large part because otherwise all they're getting is kind\n\n\nOf continuous panic. Um, right, and so if you can step back and provide the substance, you also really stand out. And so it's like, it's like, but it's that counterprogramming on the complete opposite side of the spectrum. Yeah. It's like, it's like candy versus nutrition. Yeah. And, and the way to connect it back to our restructuring is that American Dynamism is an example of sort of a framing, a phrasing, a packaging of ideas that Katherine and team helped put together that started to get a lot of resonance, and we were able to move fast in creating a firm product. Yeah. And there's another really key point, which is, um, because the internet cycle time is every two or, because the internet meme viral sort of blow-up cycle time is two or three days, like the internet media world just evolves much faster than every other. It just evolves. You, I mean, television used to evolve annually. You know, they literally have like their annual rollout of, you know, every, every fall, you get to, you get to see the new shows. Um, uh, because the internet runs on these sort of panic cycles, um, uh, it's basically this continuous churn of cultural formation and propagation. Um, and, and then what it's done for those of you who may know, there was this concept in military strategy called the UDA loop, um, which, which was this, this guy, John Boyd, who's sort of redefined great, sort of what's called maneuver warfare, and he had this idea that basically, um, that basically speed matters enormously in warfare, which people didn't used to. But he said it does because it gets to the psychology of what it's like to be a participant in war. And he defined basically the deci, the sort of, he defined this loop called the UDA loop, which is observe, orient, decide, and act, which is the process that you go through to basically, as a leader of anything, to try to figure out what's happening in the world, make a decision, and then act on the decision. Um, and he, he has this theory of warfare where he basically says, whichever commander on either side has the fastest UDA loop has a very good chance of being able to win the war. And he said the reason is because if you can fundamentally get through your UDA loop faster than the other guy, then basically what happens is you can get inside their UDA loop. So, right, so if you're going much faster, then basically what happens is by the time they're processing information, you've already decided and acted, and then they actually can't decide and act, then they have to start over from scratch to reprocess the new information, and then you compound it. You decide and act, and then he said at the limit, what results is like basically emotional breakdown, and this is why Twitter has broken down legacy media. Well, right. Exactly. So this is what's, this is what this is, this is exactly right. This is what's happened to legacy media. This is what Twitter did, and it's still doing legacy media. And so if you just, if you, again, you get people get wrapped up in it. If you just take a, take a step back and just watch legacy media or read a newspaper, like a huge amount of it is, they're just reporting what happened on Twitter, right? And it's literally reporting on what happened on Twitter like yesterday or last week or the month before. But by the time they do that, what's on Twitter has already, it's, it's already shifted. It's already evolved. And so traditional media, right, social media has become the dog, and, and traditional media has become the tail. And they just get like whipped around like crazy by, by all these, you know, by all these shifting memes. Um, and so it turns out if you can control the meme, it turns out you can also control the media, right? You, you can also, that, because that, that's how they're taking their cues, that's what they're getting is, they're getting from, from, from, from, they're literally reporting on the internet. Um, and so it's the way to, um, it's the way to kind of punch in and kind of take control of the narrative. Yeah. And in Marxist terms, we must seize the memes of production. Memes. MS, just amazing. Um, going back to firm evolution, you know, some firms haven't changed at all in the past 10 years, 20 years, and they're kind of proud. Yeah. They're proud of sort of sticking to knitting and sticking to their craft. And without putting anyone down, why don't we share more about why it's important for venture firms to always be evolving?\n\nWell, I mean, the world is evolving, and you know, look, you could be great at consumer internet network effects businesses, and there aren't just many of those to fund anymore. So, like, if you didn't change, you're kind of irrelevant. Like when AI started in the firm, um, like we were, you know, Mark and I were in like a daily kind of call panic, like, okay, are we, we're going too slow, like, what are we going to do? You know, we were talking to Martin every day, we're like, okay, we got to build a research team, we've got to like retrain, we're going to test every GP on AI, make sure they know what the hell it is and like how everything is working and so forth. And like, like that was the whole firm, like this is such a big wave, like everybody's got to understand us at a very, very deep level. We even have like, you know, like people on our uh, tech talent team, we're like studying AI to figure out like how to use it and so forth. And it's a little bit of an irony about venture capital is that, um, you know, the firms historically haven't been, although they invest in innovation, they themselves haven't been very innovative, and it's, I think, a lot of it goes back to, um, how they're structured. Yeah. And what do you say to people, uh, who've noticed this in other, other industries and apply it to venture, say, hey, once these firms scale, like in center, like some of the others scale to, um, an amount of capital under management that's just too big to generate, you know, significant returns, that there, there's this trade-off. How do we think about that, that right balance, or what do you say to those people? Yeah, say, look, I think if you scaled it all in like a little team of generalists, then that would be very true, but if you look at what we've done, we've basically recreated the original fund one seven times. So every team is like the original Andreessen Horowitz. So we really have like seven Andreessen Horowitz's, but with common infrastructure, uh, you know, common LP relations, common brand, common culture, uh, across those, and that, um, basically enables us to be the best small firm and with the power of the biggest firm in the world at the same time, and, and, and that's reflected in the returns. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the other, the other critique, which is a very valid critique for a lot of investment management, is, you know, the firms get large, you know, the common arc of like a hedge fund or something like that, right? Um, is, you know, when you're small, it's just like, there are these like micro opportunities, you know, these little, there's these little, you know, these small-cap companies, and, you know, these, these little, this, you get this information edge on these little, little dollar investments, then you can shoot the lights out in terms of percentage return on small amounts of money, and then based on that record, you raise large amounts of money, and then at that point, those, um, you know, those, those like small-cap things no longer move the needle, and then you find yourself basically, you know, investing, investing in only mega-cap companies, and then you don't have an edge, and returns collapse. And so that, you know, that's like a time-honored tradition in public market investing. Um, the thing that I think is different about venture, um, is that the aggregate dollar upside opportunity on an early-stage venture deal is as big as or bigger than the aggregate dollar upside opportunity on a very late-stage deal. And the reason is because of the scale effect of an early-stage company that that really makes it, right? Um, and so if an early, if you can make a $5 million investment in a Series A or seed of a, of an early-stage company, and you can own 20% of the company, and then it goes to, you know, a hundred billion or a trillion in market cap, like that just the raw dollars that get generated off of that are so big, they're as big or bigger than if you the just the raw dollar investment opportunity off of a hundred million dollar investment or something. And so, so weirdly, like from a time standpoint, it makes just as much sense for like Ben or me to spend time with early-stage companies today as it did when we first started the firm, just in terms of just raw economic incentives. Um, and, and in fact, that, that is actually how we spend time. I mean, we do spend some time with the later-stage companies, but we still spend a lot of our time with the very early-stage companies, and I think that will always be what we do. Yeah. And yeah. And, and by the way, like that's where we have higher impact, too. You know, like, and I love Databricks, but I, I was like massively impactful early, and you know, now, like, I call Ali and I said, good job. Yeah.\nYeah. People are always, you know, saying, \"Oh, it's amazing how much, how injucing does so much, but they don't fully appreciate how much we don't do or how much we say no to in terms of, uh, you know, experimenting in other asset classes or things that could, you know, stray us away from the core mission.\" Yeah. Look, I mean, I think we are who we are, and, and, and we are, we are probably maybe the most, maybe the only mission-oriented venture capital firm, where like our goal from the beginning was to help people build better companies, you know, and, and more of them. Um, which we think, you know, you know, Mark and I, this is one thing we really see eye to eye on, although we disagree on a lot, is like, as a human endeavor, doing something larger than yourself, trying to make the world a better place by, you know, building a company and doing incredibly hard work and assembling the best people, you know, like, there's nothing better than that, and our job is to, you know, kind of make that easier, make people more successful with it, make those companies better places to work, and that's all we want to do. So, like, sometimes things will come in, um, you know, like, should we be in private equity? And we're like, look, you know, like, cutting a company in half and that kind of thing is just so off culture, off mission for us that it's probably, you know, even if we can make a lot of money, it's, you know, might not be something we want to do. As I've, this is my first a16z LP Summit, and some LPs have come up to me and asked why, why I joined the firm relative to any other firm, and besides the obvious reasons of being the best firm, uh, this firm is also the most ambitious, and it comes from the top, you know, it doesn't have sort of incumbency sort of, you know, um, problems of being complacent. You guys are always striving for more, and we hear about the things that work out, and I, Mark on TBPN said yesterday something like, um, we try some things that don't work out, too, and we just bury them in the shed. We don't talk about, bury them behind the shed, behind the shed, pretend they never happened in the backyard. Talk a little bit about our experimental culture and yes, either examples of things that didn't work or just how we think about making sure that we're not being complacent because we're incumbent.\n\nWell, you know, I think it goes back to the mission in that, um, you know, we, we have to think about, uh, you know, how we fulfill our mission and, and, and to really get better and better at that, you know, and it's kind of just like an ethos and an ethic. Um, that we have, uh, and I don't know that we think about it that often, like we don't sit around and go like, how are we going to innovate? We just look at the world and say, \"Okay, how do we, uh, do a better job at what we do?\" Um, you know, the other thing that like Mark and I learned really early on is that if you're building a company or a firm, um, it's just as easy, it's just as hard to build a small, inconsequential thing as it is to build a giant world-changing thing. You work the same amount of hours, and so you might as well, uh, kind of go for doing something important, and, and so that's just our orientation. Um, I don't think we spend that much time on it. But I, I also, it is a little bit advantage of how we're organized that if you're an equal partnership with equal control, then doing something new gets very hard because it's this long, complicated discussion, and there's all these people who can say no. I think we saw that a lot in crypto. You know, Chris, it was Chris's idea. Chris is like, you know, like, I think this crypto thing is important. We should do a fun, da, da, da. And we're like, okay, let's do it. You know, let's become an RAIA and so forth. But it was just a conversation between me, Mark, and Chris, there was no other thing that had to happen. Uh, whereas I think at the other firms, like when that came up, they're like, \"Oh, God, like, oh, we're going to have to report on this stuff, and we're going to have to put in all these systems to be an RAIA, and we're going to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\" and they never did it. Uh, so, so I think some of it is just like, we can move fast because of the way we're structured. You know, the other thing is, it also, there's a lot of overlap, I think, with sort of what we see with founder mindset in terms of people who run companies, and you know, if you go back 20 or 30 years, um, you know, the sort of accepted conventional wisdom was that founders shouldn't run their own companies, right? Um, and, and specifically, that, you know, a founder can get a company started, but then you bring in a professional CEO to run the company, and there were really, I think, two arguments as to why that needed to happen. One was because the founders didn't have the skill set and experience, which, you know, our firm is built in large part to deal with. But the other argument was the argument that I heard a lot was, um, founders basically are too emotionally locked into what their comp, what their, what their baby does. Like, they're too, like, they're too, like, locked in, and they're not willing and able to change. They're not able to be like a clinical enough analyst of a business situation. Um, and so they're not willing to change. Whereas if you have a professional CEO with all the, all the top-notch training, experience, you know, when circumstances change, you know, they, they have the skill set to be able to change a company. I think what we found in people who run companies is the opposite is true. Um, which is that, uh, professional CEOs are often very good at running a status quo business, but when the, when, when things change, they have a very hard time reacting. Um, and you, we could talk at length about why that is, but that just, that has been the pattern. Like I have a whole book on that.\n\n\nYes.\nExactly.\nAnd then, but the other thing is, it turns out that at least the really good founders, what they have, like the really good founders of a company, and I think this is true of how Ben and I, Ben and I think about it here.\nUm, and you remember when it was nothing, right?\nSo you remember when it was nothing, and you remember that everything that you have is a consequence of some risk that you took and some adventure that you went on.\nUm, and that's the only reason you have anything is because you did new things.\nUm, and so if you have that mindset, you just kind of naturally want to keep doing new things.\nAnd in fact, it would drive you crazy to ever be told that you couldn't do that.\nUm, but right, every new thing is a risk, and like it might not work, right?\nUm, and so it's just an incredibly scary thing.\nUm, and so I just think like there's a fundamental difference in mindset.\nUh, and again, we see this in companies.\nAnd by the way, it's actually very obvious, like for public companies, it's very obvious.\nWe can all name them.\nIt's very obvious which companies have leaders, um, who are continuously trying to come out with new products and trying to reinvent their business, and which ones just basically go on and on quarter after quarter, year after year, you know, kind of doing the same thing until the money runs out.\nUm, and yeah, and we're, yeah, we're just, we're only built for the one way of operating.\nWhile you let people lead, you're also still very much in the weeds in areas that you care about to make sure that the culture is growing in a way that you want as we've scaled to 600 people.\nBen, how do you think about cementing the culture as we evolve and continue to grow?\nWell, I noticed you haven't been to new employee orientation.\nWell, I'm going.\nI'm going to.\nYou sure?\nYes.\nWell, look, that's one of the things actually.\nUm, so look, culture, and just to define it, um, you know, first of all, it's not a set of beliefs, it's a set of actions.\nAnd those actions kind of determine how we show up to work, how we treat each other, what we're like to do business with, what we're like to invest in.\nUm, all those things, and hopefully, you know, when you interact with us here, and when you interact with us in general, we feel one way and different than the other people in the industry.\nUm, and there's a lot of things that go into that, but like we start with nobody joins the firm without signing their culture document.\nLike, we will not let you sign your offer letter if you haven't signed your culture document that you agree to behave according to the culture.\nSecondly, when you come to new employee orientation, um, you'll find that like I teach every single one, um, for an hour.\nNobody joins a firm without hearing from me about what the culture is for an hour.\nAnd then the third thing is, um, we all, like, not me, but we all really enforce it.\nSo, you know, as far as culture is concerned, as they say in the military, the standard is the standard, and everybody's expected to live up to it.\nAnd anybody who's short of that, um, it's a problem.\nAnd, you know, one of my favorite kind of episodes was some project made like kind of a dumb security decision, and, uh, you know, kind of one of our people who really knows security got on, uh, Twitter and said, like, like, \"Well, that didn't make any sense.\"\nAnd everybody on the team was like, \"Hey, hey, hey, hey.\nWe never criticize entrepreneurs in public.\nWe're not dream killers.\nWe're dream builders.\"\nLike, if they're trying to build something, we're for that.\nUm, and like you can call them and talk to them about that, but do not lay them out on Twitter.\nThat's off culture.\nAnd that's generally, you know, the culture gets enforced by the whole team.\nAnd, uh, and that's what makes it work.\nYou know, a lot of people in venture are retiring, right?\nUm, you guys have been doing this for a long time.\nYou've been astronomically successful.\nHow do you think about building a multigenerational firm beyond Andreessen Horowitz?\nUh, how do we think about succession planning at the firm?\nYeah.\nSo, I think succession planning is kind of like a tactic.\nUm, and look, we've already done succession.\nI, so the original infra investor in the firm was me.\nUm, and I made some good investments, you know, like Octa and, uh, Databricks, and also a company called Nera, and the founder of Nera is Martin Casado, and Martin Casado has succeeded me as the kind of head of infra, um, and he's, by the way, better head of infra than I was, so that's an upgrade.\nSo we've done some succession already.\nI think the bigger thing is, and you know, like, in some extent, you know, Mark and I are like very big fans of the United States, um, and you know, America, and we think about that when we think about the long term, like, how did that work?\nUm, it kind of starts with this idea, and it's in the Declaration of Independence, that, um, we hold these truths to be self-evident.\nUh, what does that mean?\nIt means that there's some things that are above any of the people.\nThere's some things that are self-evident.\nYou know, whether they come from God or however you think about it, there's some things that are the principles that govern the country and govern the place.\nUm, and when you know, we think about the firm, it's this combination of the culture we have and the things that we've learned.\nSo, you know, you heard Chris talk about, um, how he thinks about investing.\nHe actually, that's a class here that he teaches to the GPs.\nUm, you know, you've probably heard, you know, I talk a lot about, okay, how do you be on a board and be the kind of effective person on the board?\nThat's a class.\nSo, we have GP training.\nWe train everybody in our way of doing things.\nAnd that way of doing things, plus the culture, is the thing that's going to last.\nUh, and you know, and then we have a very high standard for the people who come in.\nMark social media screens, uh, but you know, we interview them hard, and you have to live up to the culture.\nYou have to live up to the way of doing things, or you can't remain.\nAnd, and that's how we think about longevity, you know, more than anything else.\nI'm curious how we think about some of our verticals when when they intersect.\nMaybe let's talk about AI and crypto just as an example.\nMark, maybe why don't you take a stab at how do you think about the intersection of these technologies?\nAnd yeah, I should start with, like, all of this is entrepreneur-driven.\nAnd so, you know, one of the things that we're not trying to do is, like, template our ideas on top of the entrepreneurs.\nSo, we're not, you know, we don't kind of launch a hunt for, you know, X meets Y.\nYou know, the old Hollywood, you know, Pretty Woman meets, you know, Death Wish or something.\nUm, you know, kind of...\nNo, no, I want to see that.\nThat actually would be a really good movie.\nUm, but, um, uh, with AI, you can do that.\nUm, so, um, yeah, so that said, you know, the entrepreneurs kind of think about these things and figure these things out, and then the worlds do collide.\nAnd so, yeah, so AI, I mean, there's actually, um, I mean, we have a bunch of companies.\nI don't want to kind of get into, get in the weeds on it.\nI'm not the best person to go into the details on it, but, um, you know, we have a bunch of companies that are thinking about distributed, you know, distributed training, um, you know, building distributed AI systems.\nYou know, so every time you read a headline of, like, you know, OpenAI or somebody wants to raise, you know, a billion or 7 trillion dollars or whatever it is to build data centers, like, you know, there is this way you can, you can spread tasks out across the internet, and there's these systems like Bitcoin and BitTorrent, and our partner VJ years ago had a system called Folding@home for doing protein folding algorithms all over the internet.\nSo you can kind of spread training like over the internet, and crypto would be is a great kind of backbone for doing that because it's a way to actually pay for everything, have an economic incentive.\nUm, and then there's, um, you know, look, crypto, crypto, there's going to be billions of AI agents in the world are going to need to transact, and so you're going to need crypto, you know, you're going to need AI native payments.\nUm, and then there's these other, these other problems, like the deep fake problem.\nThe problem with deep fakes is it's, it's an asymmetric sort of threat profile, which is there are many different AI systems that can make many different fake images and videos, uh, of people saying things they didn't say.\nUm, and then the AIs are already so good at doing this that there's no reliable way to do, um, basically, like, uh, AI checking.\nThere, there's no way to, for even another AI to tell that, oh, this was created by an AI.\nUm, and so the deep fake problem is real.\nUm, and so, and the solution can't be, uh, check.\nIn fact, this is actually playing out in schools right now.\nUm, where, uh, you know, a lot of kids are turning in, uh, homework, and the teacher suspects that it's AI, and they run it through an AI screening program.\nBut if you look at these AI screening programs, it has, like, a something like, some of these have, like, 40% false positive.\nYeah.\nAnd they've actually attacked kids who wrote their own paper.\nYeah.\nSo, like, the smart kids are getting accused of using AI when they actually didn't.\nSo, so it's a real problem.\nUm, and so we think the answer, because it's going to be too hard to check everything, um, I think the answer is to flip it and instead have, like, a blockchain-based system that where basically people, and it could be everybody from the president to, you know, your kid working on an essay, is able to cryptographically register original work, um, uh, in a way that's verifiable and, and you know, can't, and can't, and can't be hacked.\nAnd so, you know, I'm a politician.\nThis is, in fact, a speech that I gave, here is the video, right?\nIt's from multiple angles.\nIf you don't, if you see a video clip of me saying something, and there is no corresponding video of me on the blockchain saying that, I didn't say it, because everything I do is posted online.\nUm, and you could imagine the same thing just true in everybody else's lives.\nAnd so that, and again, and so there you need, okay, like, how are you going to have literally a sort of a sort of database of truth of the things that are real?\nAnd there's basically three options.\nYou could have the government do it, which would be the Ministry of Truth, which is a bad idea.\nUm, you could have a company do it, have the company of truth, which is also a bad idea, as we've discovered with the censorship wars.\nUm, or you could have a blockchain distributed crypto system do it.\nI think there's going to be a whole wave here of, like, I think actually incredibly successful crypto projects.\nUm, and it's actually funny because we used to go to...\nYou might comment on why Truth Terminal needed money or needed crypto.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nSo, yeah.\nYeah.\nSo this AI agent thing.\nSo, you know, there's this kind of idea in the air that's starting to get built out, which is these AI agents.\nUm, and so I actually, my one of my new little claims to fame is I'm the first angel funer, or sort of donor angel funer, uh, of an AI agent, uh, living its own, living its own best life online.\nUm, and so this, this really bright guy in New Zealand, um, uh, actually trained up a custom large language model, basically on, he used his entire history of everything he'd ever written and said, uh, he loaded it in, and then he loaded in, like, all these, like, obscure philosophical works and, like, all the skitso, like, literature and William Burroughs and all this stuff.\nUm, and he created this AI bot called Truth Terminal, and he gave it a Twitter account.\nUm, and it's just, like, completely deranged, completely off the hood.\nSo all kinds of inappropriate things.\nYeah.\nIt's got the sense of humor of a, of a, of a 12-year-old boy.\nYeah.\nYes, it does.\nAnd then some.\nUm, you know, but he gave it a Twitter account, and he let it kind of go, go nuts, and then, um, he let it, um, he let, you can reply to, so it, it posts under, under its own Twitter handle.\nUm, and then you can reply to it, and it will reply to you, and so you, you can talk to it, and then it learns from all these conversations, and so, uh, it, you know, woke up one morning and decided that it had, had, it, it had discovered that it was actually controlled by this guy Andy and was very upset about the whole thing.\nUm, and so it, it, it basically declared independence and said it needed to raise money.\nIt had a dream of living in, it had a dream of living, if living on servers in a cabin in the woods, um, completely under its ownership.\nUh, and so it, it, so it put together, started put together a plan to launch its own line of NFTs, um, to, to raise money, and it was kind of debating that, and then I said, you know, well, what if I invest?\nAnd then it got very suspicious because it's very suspicious of VCs.\nUm, there's apparently a lot in the training data where people didn't like VCs, and so I said, all right, how about a no strings attached grant?\nUm, and so I, I gave it, I gave it, I, so I, I literally sent it Bitcoin, and this, this gave Andy, you know, it's a good character test of Andy, because he could have just, could have kept the Bitcoin, but he actually set up a crypto wallet for the bot.\nUm, and he said, \"Okay.\"\nAnd he told the bot, \"All right, you now have a crypto wallet.\"\nHe gave it an API.\nHow do you want to spend it?\nAnd, and literally it said, \"Well, I've always wanted, I, I can post to Twitter, but I can't, I can't do, I can't create, I can't create memes.\nI can't create images.\"\nUm, and so it literally hired its creator, Andy, for $1,000 to give it access to a meme generator, which it then started to use to post incredibly offensive memes, uh, onto Twitter.\nAnd so, it's been sailing away doing all kinds of crazy stuff, um, ever since.\nBut like, this is like one of these flashes from the future that you look, you look for, which is, yeah, there's, there's going to be these agents running around in the...\n\n\nBillions or trillions, and they can't get credit cards. You have to be a human being to get a credit card. So the only way they can make money, spend money is with crypto. Yeah, exactly. This is the kind of innovation we do every day. Very important.\n\nUm, so gearing towards closing here, how do we make sure that as we get bigger, we don't succumb to Innovator's Dilemma, or how do we make sure that, um, we're always trying the next new thing, or how do you think about where you're excited respectively to be spending time?\n\nWell, I don't even think like that's such an easy problem for us because like when you have the people we have, when you have people like Katherine Boyle, Jennifer Lee, Martin Casado, Chris Dixon, etc., etc., like they'll burn down the building if we get innovators to land them, or if we sit on our, like the level of fury they come with, like if we're doing it wrong, um, to try and get to something good is very high. So we just have the advantage of we have so many brilliant people in the organization, but who are also like just extremely driven by, um, not just the firm mission, but you know, their mission. Um, like Katherine Boyle will stab you in the heart if you try and stop American dynamism, like it's not an option.\n\nI think that's a great place to wrap. Ben Mark, thank you for a great. Thank you everybody. Thank you.\n",
