  "cleanText": "As Tim Cook says, people think that China is about cheap manufacturing. It's the skills they have. Apple would just argue there was no way we could even have started the iPhone anywhere else. All the experts in 1999 were like, two things. Yay for global trade. This is what we all want. And also, don't worry, China, they're going to stay a third world dictatorship forever. They couldn't have been more wrong.\n\n[Music]\n\nStephen, I've been looking forward to this episode because this is a full circle moment for me. You were how I got introduced to a16z. You were on the board of Product Hunt over 11 years ago, which is how I was introduced to you and the firm, and I'm glad to be back in business together. I couldn't be more excited for us to be working together on this one and then more in the future, I hope. Exactly. And yeah, definitely a reunion of sorts. Absolutely. So for those who haven't been longtime fans of the podcast or the firm before, you've been as for over a decade as a board partner, etc. And before that, you spent many years at Microsoft helping lead both Office and Windows, and you helped introduce the Surface PCs, which is relevant to the conversation we're about to have. So we're here to talk about Apple. We're here to talk about you inspired by the book *Apple in China*. But first, let's briefly cover WWDC. What reactions or outtakes do we have from it? WWDC is, you know, they're a big yearly developer event. It's a remarkable platform that's been doing yearly releases for 26 years. It blows my mind the what they've done and the scale that they operate at. But I think look, there were three big things that came out of it. The first was, you know, obviously the big push. It was also the big reaction, which is was called liquid glass and it's the new UI design. So having gone through multiple big UI redesigns of widely used products, although to be humble about it, not one used by a billion people, the reaction is extremely predictable, which is a bunch of people their heads just explode and they they don't want it. They don't like it. You can always tell they they dive in immediately to what problem does it solve? So if there's change, it must solve a problem. But there are lots of reasons that designs change. And then there's the reality this was the developer conference. So it's not done. And Apple is very, very good at finishing these things. And all the bugs and all the issues. I can't read it. It's blurry. It's noisy. Those will all get fixed, you know, and what's left is is it is it great and is it unique enough? And time will tell. I basically am reserving judgment and not joining in the hysteria on either side. I have no need to defend it and no need to say it's the worst thing to happen to computing, you know, since turnary processors or something. The second thing that I thought was huge personally was just that the iPad gets Windows with a lowercase W. And I think that's just fascinating like 12 different ways. You know, it goes back to the original toaster refrigerator comment or the iPad is different or Steve holding the iPad only like this cuz it was a book. And it's just a recognition of who uses it and what they use it for. I I I worry it's a little late. Like I think a lot of people have made up their minds about what to use where. Now the iPad sells an enormous number of units and people who don't use them don't understand that that it they sell more iPads, you know, than the laptop run rate in the US. Like it's a big number and they're enormously popular with different segments. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out. The weirdest thing about it is, you know, the iPad is a Mac. The Mac is an iPad in terms of the hardware. And so you're really talking about a difference in software and how they they deal with that over time and what apps run where and where is the experience is going to be super interesting. The third thing was more an act of omission than commission and which was AI and it the whole event sort of started with Craig like apologizing in a not really apologizing but in an Apple way which was like it it took more time than we planned so we're not going to talk about it anymore.\n\nAnd I personally think that, you know, months ago when they with a great fanfare launched all these AI features, that was out of character for them. They announced a bunch of stuff that they weren't done with yet, that hadn't baked. It was the right stuff, but they they didn't capitalize on it to be polite. And I think what what they're probably doing is saying we're not really good at this pre-announce catch up to our own announcements thing, which of course I grew up doing. So I'm like completely comfortable in that world of just make stuff up and hope you catch up or people forget. And so I think that they're back to like we're not the first mover company. We're the first integrator company and they're going to just sit back and watch the technology mature a little bit more. But they do have a hole in a perception sense which is Siri and and what they're going to do about that and to not talk about it very much is interesting. You know, a lot of people have commented on the sort of the failures of Apple intelligence or just Apple's sort of inability to capitalize on this on this innovation. What you we just saw Meta sort of you know purchase 49% of of scale. So they're making some big moves. How do you make sense of Meta's move? And could we see Apple do a similar type of play where they sort of buy the talent in house or or buy the company? How do you think about that? I think what Meta is doing is at the very least it's great for AI. You know, I'll let Meta decide how great it is for Meta or whatever, but it's great for AI. And the reason is is that if you go back the way platforms have been evolving, you know, the the the era of, you know, in mainframes, IBM had 100%. In PCs, Microsoft had 95%. Then you start getting out there and then in servers actually ended up being like at best case 50/50 and it's been downhill and it's all Linux now. In phones, you you have this split, you know, 80/20 globally, but you have to really dig down by country where it's 80/20 the other way. Yeah. And in cloud, it's very likely we're going to end up in a, you know, in a sort of a 40/40/20 kind of world. And and so AI, it's almost inconceivable that there'll be one winner, right? And there's the overlay is China and how that plays out. And the mobile industry is a really good example of how difficult it is. You know, the smartphone, so to speak. Japan had this huge lead in this thing called IMODE, but it only existed in Japan. And so it, you know, like they were leaders in technology and experience. They had all these micropayments, all this stuff, but like it it didn't go anywhere outside of the country. And so the biggest risk to AI is that it it becomes either it someone tries to think it's only one player which at times the federal government has acted like that or one player says it should only be us which there is a player sort of claiming that or it gets geographically constrained. It doesn't matter which one of those might happen to prevent any one of them. You just need a lot of players operating at huge scale. And so we have you know in in the startup world you have Anthropic and you have OpenAI you know and you have in pure open source you have Meta you know and then then you have Microsoft and Google. So we we have like innovation happening on all cylinders and all fronts which is great because the competition you know is basically making the call that it's going to be one and it's sort of going to be this government-driven approach. It might not be one company, but it will be one approach that's sort of sanctioned in some way. And it'll be interesting to see how that that plays out. So, I'm there's nothing better than more and open for AI right now. Well, it it's worth just commenting on the market structure point because when we look back at the last few years of our sort of growth investing in this category, we we we've been very aggressive, but we regret not being even more aggressive. And because one of those principles was, hey, we want to back the market leader. And so when you see a second place company, we're like, hey, it's not the market leader. But in this market, as you mentioned, it's not winner take all or just the market is so big that even the second place or third place can be, you know, generational companies, right? And we're not even at the point yet, which is where I believe we'll get which is the the the initial go to market has all been this cloud-based thing, but there's all these challenges with that like privacy and security and and and cost. And so, you know, the idea that we would force variable cost on the entire world of software, very tough for me as a fixed cost, low price volumes to think we'll sustain. So, I think we're still going to there's a whole wave of AI on the edge that's going to happen, which only benefits from open, right? Like, and so I'm very there's nothing but positive to say. Yeah. And so I wonder, you know, does it make sense to look at this Alexander Wing or this sort of scale, you know, as something of like a $15 billion aqua hire of Alex plus the top talent at scale? And does if you're Apple, if you're advising Apple or, you know, do they or even some of the other big incumbents need to do something similar. Obviously Microsoft, you know, is what we'll open to begin with, but if you're Apple, how do you think about how to play here? Well, I think, you know, the two plays are or three. One is going to be the sort of the weird partnership dance play that Microsoft and OpenAI have. I it seems obvious that at some point you know Microsoft will have much more first-party software. There's the we have always made our play by just having everything which is which is Amazon and so you could anything that comes out they're gonna end up supporting which is just how retail works like you don't you get all the cereals not just Froot Loops you know and and then I I think there's just the where we're going to go it our own way in a sense which is Gemini taking their approach or OpenAI itself or Anthropic itself and I I think that Apple needs to pick one. You know, they did announce like, hey, you can call any model through our API, but the real thing that Apple needs to do is figure out what model is going to be tuned to run on their unique hardware on the edge and their unique offering or constraint depending on of privacy and how that plays out. And just to evaluate one of those paths, if Satya could go back in time knowing what he knows now, do you think he might have done something or would you have considered doing something different? Um, how should we think about how this has worked out for Microsoft? Oh, these are tricky things. You can't ask me questions about my friends. But I I wouldn't putting it aside as advice. I I would say, look, I I genuinely to those listening, I do not know anything that's going on. Like um but there Microsoft has been involved in in AI research since 1993. They were the first hires into Microsoft research when the labs were formed. I was working for Bill way back then. And you know, Satcha worked closely with those researchers when he was the manager of the Bing team for a while because that was the cornerstone of what Bing was doing because that's what Google was doing in say 2006, 7 something like that. And I think that um I I would not be at all surprised. I don't know anything. I swear people, you know, that there's some first party thing that they're just trying to figure out when and how good does it have to be because if you are Microsoft, it turns out that like the strength of Microsoft is that you never have to be best. You just have to be included. Yeah. And and so it's it's likely that that will be their play. That's generally how enterprise software works. It's the inclusion and the bundle that customers value and pay lots of money for. Yeah. not being the very very best at any given moment. Right. It's fascinating how all the big players have kind of crystallized their approaches kind of in response to each other. Oh yeah. I want to segue to to the main focus of our conversation today, which is not a book review of *Apple in China*, though it's a great book, but inspired by the book. And I was just there's a few few things I just wanted to say, you know, first just the the notion that I believe they said Apple invests $55 billion a year in China. And I think the author said that's equivalent or or maybe even bigger than the entirety of the Marshall Plan is just astronomical. And this book talks about how Apple not only built its company in China but also helped build China itself, China's sort of manufacturing economy and and introduced the level of talent and and knowledge or or sort of taught China not just how to build phones but that same sort of knowledge then led then to build help build Tesla, you know, which are phones on wheels and then led to other sort of you know technologies used for the military which we'll get to. But first I I just want to ask was this inevitable or was this did this make sense at the time? How do we make sense of this 20 years later? How did this all happen? It is crazy that how it all happened. I mean I think you go back like of course Apple we all know it was in the garage in Palo Alto. They they famously built the computers there. But the thing was from the very beginning Apple itself was all about super tight control. I mean first you had was you know basically creating works of art on the motherboard and then they built a factory you know there was the factory right here and that's where they built computers and and they they just kept doing more of that tight control build the whole computer then Steve left Apple Macintosh of course famously the same thing but and Steve pushed and pushed on costs and the shape of it made the famous toaster that you carry around and things like that But after Steve left, the company had enormous difficulty competing with the IBM PC. One of the things that it did sort of later like in the in the late 1990s was a super innovative laptop. Now every\n\n\nBody's like, \"What does an innovative laptop mean?\" Well, it turns out in the late 1990s laptops, nobody bought them. Yeah. They were slow, expensive, bad computers. They were just portable. That was their big thing. And if you had to have one, you did. But they built this thing that was the original portable for Mac called PowerBook. And they tried to cram a lot of they tried to make the best laptop possible. And in order to do that, they ultimately were hitting the limits of manufacturing in the US. And so uh Jean Louie Gase, who was running the Macintosh business at the time. He was a very famous French executive for Apple that Steve hired to run Apple France working for Scully. He actually pushed to do an experiment of like partnering with Sony in Japan to build a PowerBook. And so the original PowerBook line had sort of three computers of different sizes, power and whatever. And the one model was done as a joint design effort with some which was just incredibly brazen for Apple culture to like break out like that and they did and and like it came back and the people at Apple were like, \"Wow man, this is this is this is not so bad,\" you know? And um it wasn't the best-selling model, a lot of complexity, and you could read all about it in this book or other places, but it it sort of a light bulb went off like maybe this helps us solve some of our constraints.\n\nNow, they had other constraints like the chips were wrong for the Mac, the PC was like half the price, like a lot of problems they had, but it was like a wow moment and and that that was really interesting. But they were failing at computers. Tim Cook joins Apple in like 1997 and he comes from IBM, and at IBM he was like about making PCs, and he shows up and he's already working this whole kind of world of of supply chain and all this other stuff. He then later goes to um to uh Compact, which is a famous Texas-based computer maker, um and does really helps them drive that whole whole motion of building in China. And I'll I'll talk about that maybe in a minute.\n\nBut the thing that gets built by Apple then in 1999 is this iMac G3. Now, most people aren't old enough to remember it, but it was this sort of gumdrop-shaped translucent Johnny IV creation. And you look at that and you're like, \"Wow, that's that's neat.\" And you're like, \"No, no, you don't understand. It was impossible.\" Like every element of that computer couldn't be built, right? It not just the stuff that they left off, like it didn't have serial ports and parallel ports and all this other stuff, but it it was like clear plastic. Computers came in gray stamped aluminum metal boxes with screws. And this was like a toolless, fanless, like amazing thing. And it totally and it was all done through this this kind of China-based manufacturing stuff, but it was done in a very unique way at the time, which was the Apple people just went there and smothered the manufacturing line and they every step and samples back and forth and this whole deal. And I'm glossing over a very complex timeline of events and it's it sounds a little bit more all or nothing and sudden, but it's a very gradual transition. But this product was was huge. And then the next one was the iPod, right? And and so now they're already comfortable with this model a little bit, but the iPod was like all of a sudden the the assembly of it starts to look like like almost like a war games screen of all these incoming things cuz it's it's like a disc drive invented in Japan, manufactured in in um Thailand, and all the stuff is coming together and all the parts, the click wheel and everything are in China, and it's all of a sudden being made in one place in this incredible form factor. Like if you were to look at the other media players at the time, they were these big honken plat. They looked like game console things like not this solid deck of cards, right? Glued together with no tolerances. I mean it's incredible. And so that was really the start of designed in Certino, manufactured in China, right? And that whole that whole process and and that was celebrated at the time, right? Because we were excited about sort of more integration with China. So that wasn't seen as such a problematic thing at the time, right? Oh, it's it's absolutely it's even more than that. Like this was like hailed as like this is the modern way to do business. Like like a very an example of this that's just super close to home about how things have changed was that in 1999 the World Trade Organization gathered in Seattle to um ratify China as a member of the World Trade Organization. And this is the organization that like that sort of navigates tariffs and trade rules between countries. All the cool countries were in it, but not like communist socialist China, you know, without with, you know, a totalitarian government all. And so the Clinton administration had really pushed for China to come and it actually split the Democratic party. People today their heads would explode if you try to sell it. And it turns out the Republicans were split too. Yeah. Because half the Republicans were like free trade, free trade, free trade. And the other half were were like, \"We hate communism. We hate commun.\" And and so the whole world, if you look back in 1999, look, it's like completely upside down from today. And and there were huge riots in Seattle, like the city was like a mess over this moment because it was viewed as this basic like this this pro business, anti-labor kind of thing because it just meant cheap outsourcing in China. Now the reason for that was because that was the whole direction of American business. There's a very famous book in the 80s called In Search of Excellence. And In Search of Excellence is sort of this Jack Welchian GE management mantra of like what you do, you stick to your knitting. Like you do the stuff that you're good at and you outsource everything else and you figure out that that core part of your company and and it was like that was what you just did. like you don't have full-time people to water the plants. You don't have full-time people to cook in the kitchen. You don't have full-time people manufacturing. You just do that elsewhere. And that was the state of American business. It was like, let's get into China. Let's we got the support of the president. It's the whole global market. Let's reduce trade barriers between countries. And so it was celebrated as the start of a whole new industrial era.\n\nSo, at what point did that change both for Apple as a company that they realized, hey, maybe we're maybe we have some risks here uh but also from a geopolitical standpoint? Was it was it when she came to power? Was it when Trump was elected? How did things start to change? It it helps on this one to go a little bit backwards. Sure. I think too because I before we get to like when did Apple recognize we we should say like there are other examples of of everybody doing this and and it the reason it's important is because it contrasts with Apple which is the PC industry created what enabled Apple to do what Apple did. So Apple was on this path of like let's manufacture in China and let's keep very tight control. But the PC industry had a whole different approach which was this much more classical in search of excellence outsourcing methods. So you know Dell and Compact, which were the two big makers with IBM, were were in Texas and you know Michael was building PCs in his dorm room and then they had a factory in Texas. Compact were some business guys who like built a whole factory in Texas and the parts were being flown in from wherever they came from. Disc drives from this country, CPUs from Intel in the US, whatever, cables from China and stuff like that and assembling them in the US. But the problem was they were all standard parts like the whatever when you bought a computer from Dell and from from Compact if you open them up, Intel processor, Seagate disc drive also from US, you know, like all and and so they were really not competing on who could buy those parts and put them into a gray or beige box more quickly. They were competing on the other three Ps of the marketing mix which is price, place, and promotion, not just product. And so if you go back to In Search of Excellence, well, the idea is well since we can't compete on manufacturing, let's just make it as cheap as possible. And so they compact led and they they were they were making the cases for compacts, which were these like 15-pound aluminum and like you could they were like shipping containers basically that held the PC. They were making those in China. So it was the biggest, heaviest part. So it sort of made sense to see like how many parts could we get in the box before we ship the box to the US, which was two-thirds of the market. And so they just started going to these assembly plants and and they went to one and said, \"We want you to build our PC.\" And they said, \"You got it.\" Cuz these they are hungry. They they want and they were just having the ability because of WTO and all this other stuff to like open up and just do business. And so they were like the capitalists in in South China. And so um they were like whatever you want us to do we're going to do it. And so Compact being very you know they want secrecy and intellectual party. So they were like that we'll build you a building. And so all of a sudden compact had like a building that was theirs and then they went to Dell and we'll build you a building too. And also there's this other company that makes music players. They have a building over here. and all these makers were starting to serve multiple PC companies and and then the PC companies were like, \"Hey, this is kind of working for us because we're crushing Apple in the marketplace and our PCs are getting cheaper and people are buying more and and the Windows 95 thing is taking off. Everything is just dandy.\" And so they they started just like saying, \"Hey, we don't even need engineers. Like we whereas Apple was like flying more and more people to do more and more advanced stuff.\" They were like, \"More gray boxes, more interchangeable parts, more lower cost. We'll just keep selling more and making it up in volume.\" And that's exactly what was happening. And so the these people, which were called ODMs, original design and manufacturers, were saying, \"You just tell us roughly what you want, we'll make it.\" Yeah. And and so you'd go to meetings with them, and they would just show prototypes of all the computers they could build, and they would just you pick, \"You want this one? you and they're like, \"Well, I'm a little taller, smaller, thicker, thinner. We want to be able to swap out graphics cards.\" Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes, and here's the Dell logo on it. And then they got very, very good. So, they were effectively moving up the stack and becoming product makers and designers. And they be and the reason is very simple. They also couldn't compete on labor. Like the way that the government was working, the socialist part of this experiment was you you can't live anywhere you want in China. You have to you live where you're born and if you want to move it's a whole thing. You're not allowed to just move. But what China was doing was taking all the hundreds of millions of poor people and letting them live temporarily in all the factories of all kinds, clothes and cars and computers where live for part of the year and then bring massive amounts of cash back to the rural and that's how China lifted a billion people out of poverty. Yeah. Well, those are all the same workers. So you you can't keep get a better deal on labor, right? And and then you're all going to the same ODMs who are building the same factory. So it's hard to get a better deal on that. So the ODMs were just they in order to compete, they were moving up the food chain. And the American electronics world, whether it was TVs or whatever, we're like, \"Yeah.\" Or Japan with doing it with Sony were like, \"We love this. Just keep showing us more stuff we can put our brand our name on and we'll just focus on sales and marketing and distribution and branding. We're awesome.\" And so the start of all of this was really and by the way like little things like there were all of a sudden 50 different music players. Yeah. Because all that knowledge was distributed throughout all these makers. And so it was very very interesting. Now what was really going what's it like to visit one of these ODMs? Like these guys are crazy. Like so you think like when I first went they're like you've been there a few times a bunch. Oh, I I lived in China like in 2004 even and that's all I did was visit all these people all the time and the government and we go on forever about but the the thing about these was um you know you'd think you'd go and it's like a factory like how exciting and I've been to like car factories and washing machine factories because they're all Microsoft customers so you go and you visit them and they all show you plants and stuff and you know you go and like all of a sudden you're like oh my god this is like a hospital like and I've been to Intel which is like an operating room like it's all bunny suits and all but this is like they're just joining parts It's the same thing I do in my living room when I buy a PC. Like I'm just putting all the parts. But they, you know, these things are football field size. And I should say just for a baseline, I I did summer jobs at the factory that built um intercontinental ballistic missiles and surface-to-air missiles in Orlando. So I've seen big giant factory floors before. There are like thousands of people on ten hundreds of acres of assembly and you just watch like computers flying off and and so the owners of these are very proud and they they take you on tours. You go and you meet the CEO founder of these ODMs and they take you on the tour. They show you everything. They show you every step in the line and then they but you know they show you the one you're allowed to see. Yeah. So like I was at Microsoft I couldn't see any of them. So, but I could see he was very proud to always show me like one step in the process. And that was the step when they attached the Windows logo to the PC, something Steve Jobs would never have allowed. But the Windows logo meant it was a legal copy\n\n\nof Windows. The whole reason I moved to China was because they were stealing Windows and Office left and right, and my job was to sort of somehow help to see if we could stop that. But they were very proud and very legal about that step. And so, I have lots of photos of stickers being put on computers. And then you go outside and he goes, \"That's where we make HP laptops. That's where we make, and this is where we make those other laptops that we're not allowed to tell you about.\" And that's the difference. And what was going on in the Apple building was just super important, right? And that's where we get to the answer of your question. Like the Apple building was like fast forward a little bit, and they're building what became the MacBook Air. Yeah. And so, like the MacBook Air goes back to the original PowerBook 100 experiment, which was how can we take what basically sucks, which are laptops that Windows people use? Like, give you an idea, like when the MacBook Air came out, the typical knowledge worker in a company was traveling with about six pounds of computer gear. Yeah. Which was a laptop. It was probably an inch and a half thick, you know, 9 by 12. It had one of these padded laptop cases that you sometimes see. It was awful. I actually wouldn't even travel. I only used Japanese laptops that were spitting envelopes and stuff. And then, um, they would, uh, so Apple was building the MacBook Air. And so now we know it was this machine, aluminum chassis in that building that they showed us, and it was like remarkable. Yeah. Now, Steve held it up and put it in an envelope, and everybody, it fits. And I'm like, my Sony fits in an envelope, but my Sony was $3,500, made by hand in Japan. Yeah. And this was kind of a miracle. And the problem was that the ODM who was on tour with me, you know, we went up. So this is what happens. You go on the tour, they take you up a secret elevator, and then you're, it's like you're literally above the factory, and all of a sudden I'm like in a Bond movie. And like, I, the elevator door opens, and you're in this football field office with like a tea ceremony room and like weird ancient suits of armor for art. Were you ever terrified? I was completely terrified. I'm like, I'm like, \"Oh my...\" And of course, nothing ever, no one ever gets hurt, and like, but like, what the hell? Like, I'm like looking, is there a stairway that's going to turn to a slide, and I'm going to end up being eaten by Japanese Chinese sharks or something? But there's like ancient scrolls, and we have to go through, and every single piece of art, I'm getting the story, and every, and I'm like, I'm jetlagged. I have to pee, and like, I'm here to just make sure the stickers are going on the laptops, but I'm getting the full deal. And then we sit down, and he's like, \"The Windows people are losing.\"\n\nThat's me. Yeah. And because I am building these great things, and then he shows me prototypes for all these Windows computers. So these are the ones that he built without any help from the Apple people. Wow. And he's like, \"We could build these, but we can't convince, you know, Michael or or Dell or Compact or anybody to build them. They're too expensive or whatever. I can make them cheaper.\" But, and I also, and this is where they get candy, is like it's very difficult to work with those people. They don't give him any degrees of freedom. He can't be creative, but he also can't move up the stack.\n\nAnd the PC people just wouldn't do it. And so two lessons from that. One is that Apple taught them how to do this. Now, they didn't plan on doing that, right? But osmosis happens. Yeah. And they got all these skills. And then the other was Apple was still going to uniquely do it. And no one else was going to come and invest that money.\n\nNow, we were there also at one point to help them help get Surface built. We were actually doing it to solve the problem of the reason Surface exists is because the PC makers wouldn't build like an aluminum computer, basically. Mhm. Or an all-in-one for that matter. And so, like we actually, we did a whole different approach to metal. We actually built a whole metallurgy plant to do injective magnesium alloy for the original Surface Computer that ran Nvidia chips and all this other stuff. And then, um, and we were going to, like, we were willing to make cases of any size or shape for the OEMs, but they just saw it as a niche. And so, Apple, so the PC makers just continued to stamp out routine things for at least three more years until Intel finally invested a bunch of money in the OEMs via pricing to get them to build what today look like laptops for Windows called Ultrabooks. Yeah. And but Apple just continued to do that, and they were building that expertise just inadvertently, and then Intel came in and piled on more, and so more people knew, except in the sort of the slightly more open part of China. And so it, it just, it, it was like this slow-moving osmosis that gets us to the point where, as Tim Cook says, people think that China is about cheap manufacturing, but it's the skills they have. Like nobody else in the world could run 500 prototyping aluminum milling machines at one time and produce the right defect rate and save all the waste and develop all the stuff, you know, all these things. Like when we were making Surface, you know, you have to use all this pressure-sensitive adhesive and keep all the things together to make it USB thickness, and like nobody here knows how to do that. They were telling us what they were doing. Yeah. And that is what happened. And it was not by, it was not a design. And that's one of the differences I have with the book. The book is clear. It wasn't on purpose, but it still makes it seem like we could have stopped it at any point. And I, I don't, not only do I not see that we could have, there was no interest in stopping it. Like, it, for the global view of trade, it was working exactly as planned for everybody. Yeah. And so let's get now get back to when did that start to change? You, I don't know if it's going in the book or someone said, \"Hey, China has Apple by the balls or has us by the balls.\" Let's talk about that and what did we realize that happened at one point, it's the point of no return.\n\nSo the point of return was basically, I would say two years into the iPhone, the scale was such, yeah, there was nowhere else. Even I'm sure Apple would just argue, \"Oh, there was no way we could even have started the iPhone anywhere else.\" And I could tell you, we, like Surface, there was no chance we were, and that's a low-volume product, like there was no, no chance, and most things are very low volume, which makes the non-recurring engineering costs much higher, so even more impossible to build. All the startups, you know, you can't even consider doing that. So I, I like the point of no return happened so long ago that it's sort of a weird thing to think about, $50 billion a year in investment, because that's not what did it. What did it was was this unique blend of socialism or totalitarianism and entrepreneurship. Yeah. And that's the thing that all the experts got wrong. All the experts in 1999 were like two things: \"Yay for global trade. This is what we all want.\" And also, \"Don't worry, China is, is they're gonna stay a third-world dictatorship forever.\"\n\nThey couldn't have been more wrong. And I frankly, that's how I felt living there, right? Like I was like, it does, you know, like yes, obviously it feels totalitarian. Like you turn on CNN and you're watching, and then it vanishes, and you're like, \"Well, that was weird.\" You know, you try to connect to a website randomly from the link, and you can't see it anymore. And there all these people that work for the government in our office, and I can't talk to them, and I don't know why they're there, and I'm their boss. It's super weird. Like there's a lot of stuff that as an American you're like, \"This is just kind of strange.\" But you go to the ODM, I, I could have been visiting Kimberly Clark in a plant or right, Kelloggs. It looked like a factory with a person who was like, \"Just tell me what I can make and sell. I'm there for you.\" And and so you're, you're in this weird hybrid world that was completely predicted wrong, right? And and so you wake up and and you're like, \"Oh, well, they were really working.\" And a great way to think of it is like the car industry. So the car industry, there was no auto industry when I was living in China. All the cars were Volkswagen or or Mercedes. And that's what everybody drove around. That's what if you owned a car, you owned a Volkswagen. If you got driven around, you got driven around a Mercedes. And that's just how it was. And the rate the way they got there was by doing these joint ventures with with the China, and that was the mandated way, and the joint venture came with like, you know, these terms that were onerous, like you had to give them all your IP, right? You know, and so for us, like even to get a license to sell software, not that anyone was buying it legally, but to sell software, you had to sort of allow these inspectors to come in and see stuff, and like we had to shut down Hotmail for forever because like we wouldn't let them see the data center servers, which weren't even in China, and all sorts of complexities. But if you wanted to sell into the world's largest population market, yeah, that was your choice, comply or not. In the meantime, they're the entrepreneurs in southern China are, they're not looking at Beijing for government direction. They're actually going, \"Well, we have to beat Korea. We have to beat Japan. We have to beat Singapore. We have to beat Vietnam or Indonesia.\" And those are all their neighbors, and they see them all. And and like we met once with um, and so the car companies, if you just fast forward, they all are out of China now, these joint ventures, they could never get their money out, they lost all their IP, their manu, it's just horrible to like Volkswagen, Ford, Mercedes, it's just been a nightmare. Tesla doesn't have, didn't have to do a joint venture, which is sort of the modern thing, just like Apple, where they were allowed to operate, but it turns out there all these soft ways, yeah, that the company could be miserable. That's where it goes from entrepreneurship to the social socialist totalitarian, where they can just, you know, the Communist Party could just say, \"We all need to have phones, and we like this model from Huawei.\" Yeah. Or we're picking a new 5G standard, and it's going to step all over the Qualcomm patents, but it's only in China where we enforce the laws. And you're like, \"But the WTO says the what? Says what?\" Like, and you know, you're, you get really stuck on on this kind of stuff. And and I think what what everybody learned was in, you know, say 2000s, 2010 was very easy to pour money into China. Yeah. But it doesn't come out. Nobody, the returns just aren't, aren't there. And then it's also easy if you're one of the blessed sort of companies to sort of grow, but but then all these soft things happen. Now a lot of people love to say how that's just totalitarian governance, but they forget like the history of trade in America. Yeah. You know, like it's actually, you know, or we talk about the EU a lot, but you know, we have a lot of these soft things, too. You know, like when San Francisco County wants to buy fleet vehicles, they, they don't, they just say, \"Well, they have to be American cars, right?\" Like, they don't even think about it. They're like, \"Step one has to be an American car.\" Yeah. And when the defense department buys stuff, like there's a massively thousand long, thousand-page list of all the things that you have to check off in order to be sold to the defense department. To the outside world, that looks like safety and security. But it, it also could be viewed just as much as protectionism. Yeah. And it's this, it's just two sides of a coin. Yeah. Um, okay. So the, when we look at Apple's dependency on China, when does this go from sort of okay, um, this is great, to okay, this is actually an existential risk for the for the company, um, or, or would you say we, we are there yet, or how is this developed, you know, into the, into the current era? The easiest way to view the wakeup call is is through the lens of COVID, right? I, I think, which is all of a sudden the entire world learned that this global system, while great for prices, great for in search of excellence, focus on what you're knitting and what you do well, it turns out it's, it's actually pretty fragile. Yeah. And it's fragile because there's single points of failure all over the place. Yeah. And and in this case, the single point to failure turned out to be like, well, you can't go all, if this city is closed, no one can go into the factory. Yeah. And then if, if transit is closed, then the stuff can't make it. And so I, I just think COVID was the wakeup call for the whole system. And of course, at the national security level, it's, it's massively important now because, you know, you can't afford to have a nation shut down, right, because of these things. And if all the technologies are based on chips, which are assembled in one place and packaged by these people who have all the skills to package them, that you go, \"Well, that's, that's sort of a problem.\"\n\nNo, the defense for long ago figured this out for like guns and rockets. Like, you know, the the military sidearm is a Beretta pistol, which is the the oldest company in the world in Italy. And you know, the first thing Italy did to win the bid was set up a factory in the US. And so, good news, we have plenty of sidearms that we could throw at the drones or something, you know, but drones is the opposite end of the spectrum. Like all of a sudden, drones are the most important thing. And like all of a sudden we were like, we don't even, we don't, not just we don't make the drone, we don't make any of the parts for the drone. Yeah. And they're all made, the only person who makes them is our enemy, so to speak. So this seems to be a problem. And so let's say Trump brings you in and says, \"Hey, I've noticed that, uh, you nearly all of computing is, uh, you know, every stack is, is done in\n\n\nChina and, and you know, Asia more broadly.\n\nUm, and I'm trying to sort of decrease our dependencies.\n\nUm, Microsoft, man, what should I do?\n\nWell, obviously, there are much smarter people who know more and have much more at stake than I do trying to solve this.\n\nI, I mean, you have to do it.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike, it, I, the thing is, it, it goes against all these academics that were experts in 2000 that said it was good.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut they didn't think about all of these, like, nobody thought that the dependency would be on, on, you know, sort of the replacement for the Soviet Union in terms of longtime enemy.\n\nAnd, and so you, now you, you know, no more would we to be dependent on the Soviet Union for something than we would be on, on China.\n\nLike, you, there's no choice in that matter now.\n\nHopefully, our day with China is already vastly more open than anything that up until 1990 that the Soviet Union was.\n\nSo we're in a very good, sort of peaceful situation there.\n\nBut that doesn't change the posture.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so, you know, Apple is like doing this experiment.\n\nIt's obviously more than experiment to build in India, which solves their problem.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily solve the, the current administration's view of the solution.\n\nRight?\n\nI mean, because if you think of it, like the other part of free trade that inverted, twisted, and, you know, split the party, the political parties in half in the US was NAFTA in, in the early 1990s, which was like free trade with Canada and Mexico.\n\nWhat could be more of a no-brainer?\n\nWell, it turns out it was also the global view of things.\n\nLike, in fact, NAFTA, half the Democrats voted against it, half the Republicans voted against it.\n\nThe same as WTO kind of stuff.\n\nAnd, and here we are, like, well, that meant that all the jobs just moved to Canada and Mexico.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, and, you know, long term, also, not having employed people is a bad thing.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's manufacturer or anything.\n\nIt's just like weird that just being across a border would so substantially change the economics of what's made.\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, especially when you literally just drive the parts back and forth through Texas.\n\nYeah.\n\nIs kind of weird.\n\nOr Minnesota or whatever.\n\nAnd so, so I think this reset is happening broadly.\n\nI don't like the idea that, that the people who are very much in favor of this global world sort of ignore the inherent risks of the polarized world, but also just immediately jump to, \"No one's going to pay $5,000 for an iPhone.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nI think what an incredibly silly argument because if you were to look at an iPhone and think about making it by hand, you would go, \"It's going to cost like $100,000 each one.\n\nIt's like a fancy watch.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so what the reason that it's $1,000 or $1,500 or whatever is because of the innovation in manufacturing.\n\nSo all that needs to happen is like another step function change in manufacturing.\n\nAnd of course, for decades, that's all Apple woke up and thought about.\n\nSo they, they remained that whole operating mode of Apple's of being sending zillions of people being on the factory floor design.\n\nThat's what they do.\n\nYeah.\n\nThey rely on skills, but they are there inventing these things.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, and so, you know, if you look at, you know, the Apple, um, Apple Vision Pro, like it has all these lenses and all they were on top.\n\nThey made all of that stuff.\n\nAnd so what they're going to do is they're going to focus on, okay, if we have to do this, we're, we're going to also end up with giant factories of robots or better automation or new packaging technologies that don't require as many steps, all this stuff that they have already the world leaders in.\n\nSo you're, you're sort of optimistic or that this is a solvable problem that they can decrease Apple can decrease its dependency and figure out whether it's French or I think everybody isn't.\n\nI don't, I, you know, it's easy because of the book to focus on Apple.\n\nEverybody faces this problem, like, you know, even if you make cars in Detroit that are really manufactured and assembled in Canada, like, where do all the in-dash electronics and all the car computers come from, right?\n\nThey're just flown in on a plane to be glued in and so there.\n\nI, I'm, I'm not, I'm not just optimistic.\n\nI mean, this is literally how innovation happens.\n\nLike, innovation isn't invention.\n\nInvention is like, was just sitting around thinking what would be really cool to make.\n\nBut innovation is like, this is the constraints that I have to work in.\n\nLike, I'm going to solve this problem, and nobody loves to do that more than engineers.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd, and so, like, if you're a packaging engineer, like, in the software, hardware, motherboard, like, this is like, you live for this.\n\nHow do we reduce the steps?\n\nHow do you reduce the components?\n\nHow do we cram more into this?\n\nThis is like your whole focus in life.\n\nIt's your mission.\n\nSo, of course, I mean, like, yes, and they've been working on it.\n\nAnd so the way innovation happens is the people who have been working on stuff go, \"I have a totally better idea,\" and then you try it, and like, \"Oh, this one worked, the other thousand didn't work.\"\n\nI mean, that translucent case, like, it's not like people hadn't thought of making plastic cases before, and transl plastic was like a thing, and then they sat down and they just made it because you can build things like that's a thing that happens and factories are things that can be built.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so, like, I, there, I don't see any reason why.\n\nI just, I think that the mistake is either thinking that China is about cheap labor, or the mistake is thinking that for things to be made in the US, it has to recreate 300 million migrant workers on buses working, right, temporarily and going back home.\n\nLike, I don't know, that's just one way that was their constraint.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike, their constraint was, \"We have to employ all these people, but not let them move.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nThat was their constraint.\n\n\"We have an idea.\n\nLet's build the factories in Shenzhen and get a bunch of buses and dorms.\"\n\nYeah, problem solved.\n\nRight.\n\nWe have a different one.\n\nWe don't have 100 extra million people.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe have a lot of money and a lot of intellectual power and a big desire to bring low-cost high-tech products to people.\n\nYeah.\n\nLet's just sell, let's build things.\n\nAnd gearing towards closing here, you know, it felt inevitable to me, sort of, that Apple, you know, would become this, uh, even much bigger than it is today in the sense of, I remember reading the stat of, like, wait, I'm sorry, much bigger than, like, the hugest company in the world.\n\nMuch bigger because, you know, nine out of 10, um, I think high schoolers, um, you know, prefer Apple products.\n\nAnd so if you sort of, when they get to college, when they graduate, like, why isn't sort of iPhone market share much bigger?\n\nWhy wouldn't it just keep getting sign significantly bigger?\n\nUh, not, not just in phone, but also in, in, um, sort of laptop, desktop as well.\n\nAnd so the, um, but when you look at the risks, maybe sort of this, this, you know, the, the China situation just drastically increases prices if if something were to materially happen in the short term, or maybe there's a new form factor that Johnny I, open AI, or or someone else figures out that overplays the phone that doesn't seem uh, super likely in the short term, but h, how do you sort of react to that to sort of...\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, I, I think, you know, look, people always think that, like, like, you're either in the school that things are just going to keep going like they're going to go forever, or like, \"Idiot, this thing is over.\n\nThere's already a new thing,\" but there's like, you can't buy or touch the new thing.\n\nAnd we are in that in between space right now.\n\nAnd I do think that, um, that it's, it's highly likely that that new ways to make things will get figured out.\n\nIt's highly likely that it's going to get much more competitive in phones only because the target is a little bit more stable.\n\nAnd the best way to think of it is like Macs are, you know, half the laptop market in the US at this point, you know, not quite, but with segments.\n\nAnd, and so nobody thought that would ever happen.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut that's partially because the, the reason that could happen is because the use case for laptops stagnated at about 2,000.\n\nAnd so all of a sudden, I'm basically running a browser and Microsoft Office.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd if you're doing that, a Mac modulo, the differences in Office is roughly the same.\n\nAnd, and so then if there the price is the same at $1,000, why not?\n\nHalf the market is always going to view it as a price point, like, and $1,000 is $200 more than $700.\n\nAnd, and so a certain amount of the market is going to buy the phone that's free with the plan.\n\nAnd that's just going to happen.\n\nBut more and more of the market will see the phone as like a, a positive, you know, a positive part of life and be willing to invest in it like any branded item.\n\nAnd I, I think that's going to happen.\n\nSo I, I don't, but I don't know what's going to happen on the device side.\n\nI, I think generally speaking, the form factor is going to last much longer than even the most optimistic people think.\n\nI mean, you know, there's like a lot of people running PCs still, you know, even though nobody in Silicon Valley knows that.\n\nAnd, and I, I, but I, I, I think like it's just going to be up for grabs.\n\nLike there's no, nothing written anywhere.\n\nBill Gates used to always, always, always have to remind people that, you know, Microsoft, any day, somebody could just show up and do a better version of everything Microsoft does because it's software and the, the, the economy of scale, all that stuff isn't the barrier that people used to think.\n\nManufacturing devices specifically has a barrier, but also because of the automation, because of all this work that's going on, that barrier is just going to drop.\n\nIn fact, it has dropped.\n\nThe only reason that there are so many amazing Samsung phones is because they've all seen the movie.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike they know what to do.\n\nYeah.\n\nIs there anything else you want people to, to take either from, from this book or from this, this conversation kind of in summary?\n\nWell, I, I, I think I would sort of just drill down on one issue that I just think is is super important for people to really consider in the competition between the US and China and also how it relates to AI, which is the difficulty we're all going to have collectively to navigating the world of intellectual property.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, I, I just think, I think it's very, very easy to say China doesn't respect intellectual property, so they can't be part of the world stage, flat out.\n\nI mean, they've crushed the pharmaceutical industry that way.\n\nYou know, what they've done with BYD and Tesla, arguably pretty rude, and stuff like that.\n\nBut on the other hand, it's just as easy to say, well, because of AI, all knowledge, all content, all information just needs to be free to train and to reuse.\n\nNeither of those are realistic positions.\n\nAnd, and I, I think that this issue is far more subtle and far more important than than I think either China thinks or the sort of the digerati in the US think.\n\nAnd I, I believe that that's one that's going to need a lot.\n\nAnd I worry about wild cards.\n\nLike I worry about the European Union going crazy in one direction or another and passing some rule.\n\nThen all of a sudden that market is weird.\n\nOr Japan, which was like, went the other way because they have a language challenge, which is Japanese.\n\nLike they could just, they're in control of Japanese.\n\nSo they just said, \"Yeah, we could train anything here,\" but it's like, \"Yeah, but that's just Japanese, or is it a loophole for English?\"\n\nWe're not really sure.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so I think that that issue is the one where policy makers need to spend the most time, but it's also structured in the US that it's just, it's a litigation issue and there's no way around it.\n\nSo we're in for years of kind of market uncertainty over how this plays out.\n\nAnd that's been a core part of Apple's advantage has been their ability to maintain the intellectual property of, of components and manufacturing and assembly.\n\nAnd, and now that's dispersed.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's a a good place to to end.\n\nSteven, this has been a fantastic conversation.\n\nThank you so much for coming on.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt was great to be back together.\n",
