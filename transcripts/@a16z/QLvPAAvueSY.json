  "cleanText": "It used to be like the rule of thumb was, you don't change your fundamental pricing model more than once every 5 years. Agent Force, like literally Salesforce, one of the biggest companies in the world, changes fundamental pricing structure three times in the past 12 months. Now that's insane to me. Like I don't know how they retrained their sales team, and you know, maybe it's going well, maybe it's not. But the point is that some of the largest companies in the world are moving at historical speeds. And so if you're the one sitting there, startups on the one hand are kind of like cannibalizing or rewriting your market, and you're sitting on a pricing change that you're going to sit and you're going to do a 9-month case study and then roll it out after 6 to 9 months, you're going to be like a year and a half behind, and by the time you even go live, your pricing model is going to be outmoded.\n\nReally, the kind of genesis of what we're doing, the way we think about it, is like monetization infrastructure. So kind of take all the process of how a company generates value and captures it and turn it into software infrastructure. That's like ultimately what Metronome is all about. And you know, if you're trying to think about it in terms of technology, it's roughly like DataDog plus a billing engine is like what we literally do. Metronome actually starts from my time at Dropbox. So I worked there from 2013 to 2019, and I was in charge of essentially the engineering part of monetization, what we basically called monetization growth. So our job was to kind of do the pricing and packaging, build the front-end experiences, launch new SKUs and add-ons, and our goal at the end of the day was to drive revenue growth of the business. So that experience really taught me the power of essentially monetization, pricing, and packaging and helping grow a business. But there were kind of three challenges that my team ran into. So the first was, um, we would go do like a pricing experiment, like let's go, let's go try to charge this set of users this different price, like instead of charging them $9.99, let's call them $11.99. Those pricing experiments would basically require someone to go write code in the billing system, and frequently, because that code was so fragile, it would take anywhere from a quarter to two quarters to get that pricing change live in production, which was insane because, like, you know, we could do the front-end work in like a day, and so the cycle time of the experiment in was like months. The second challenge we ran into was that we would do that change, and then customers would get really confused. And the kind of root problem there was our billing system was essentially a script that ran once a quarter, once a month, once a quarter, depending on the on the billing cycle, but customers were in the product every single day. They're looking at the price. They're looking at how much they're going to pay. And because again, the bills were only computed like once every full moon, uh, that meant that customers only got information out of the billing system like once a month. And so they'd find out about pricing changes after they'd already paid for the new price. So there's like this, this really challenging like customer experience problem. And that really taught me that billing was really honestly more of a product surface than a than a like a like a once a month workflow. And then the third problem we ran into at Dropbox was as, uh, you know, we were customers of the billing system, but the data that came out of the billing system, basically we didn't have access to. It kind of, you know, we'd write invoices, we'd get paid or not get paid. You know, they do these like collections processes, and then eventually it'd flow into a general ledger, and then like some business analyst would do some work, and they'd tell us, \"Oh, by the way, you made the company $6 million last quarter or something like that.\" That lag time of like experimental learning, it's like if you've ever worked in growth, is like anathema. Basically, what it was saying is that our learning loop was roughly two quarters. That's way too slow for a business. And so I wanted to build a system that was fundamentally like meant to solve the monetization problem. And, uh, and we're really, that's like kind of been our animating kind of drive for the past 5 years.\n\nIs there an inflection point that caused you to do this? Has this been like some long outstanding problem that just nobody decided to solve, or is there some change that caused you to kind of come out, start a company around usage based billing?\n\nI think the kind of, I think billing is one of those, if you like talk to people who've worked at companies, billing is always like where engineer career go to die, like, and and it's like, it's like, and the, and so if you ask why, it's like fundamentally every company prices and packages subtly differently, and what that means is that like the person who's in charge of encoding that pricing and packaging, their job is essentially to kind of hardcode a bunch of business rules that are specific to this company at this point in time, and they're doing it under the gun always. Like at Dropbox, for instance, our billing system was built by interns every summer. Like it would get updated every summer because the only people we could convince to work on it were like interns. And what that means is like exact, so boring, and it's like, you know, if I could optimize the sync engine or I could go work on billing, I'm going to choose to work on the sync engine 100% of the time. And so what happens is it kind of leads to this like steady accumulation of technical debt, and it just becomes this giant rat nest. Um, now when you're on seat subscriptions, like, you know, it's actually not that hard to do billing. It's like, okay, how many users do I have? Okay, like let's do a count on the user table and then multiply by the price. Okay, relatively simple. Now there's a lot of complexity in there. It's still like, it's kind of annoying, but it's not that hard. In usage, it's like, now you're like, okay, I, you know, we have a trillion queries on chat GBT, and what we're doing is we're pricing per token, but if it's like above this token amount, it's priced totally differently, and so actually now the complexity of the problem of generating the invoice isn't like counting on a user table that has like a million rows in it. It's like join across these 50 different data sources and the super complex pricing structures. And so usage billing was the thing that kind of triggered us to be interested because fundamentally it's a data infra problem married to the same like, you know, billing complexity part, but it's that data infra that actually made it worth solving and caused like, you know, me to be like, okay, actually this is a problem big enough to go solve, and actually if we solve it, it's actually more valuable than than the prior generation.\n\nI think it's actually worth going through a bit of the history here. So, so I sit on a bunch of boards of AI companies. They're all trying to think about how to do usage based billing. Like that book hasn't really been written yet. But we've seen big pricing changes in the past. Like so when I did my company, like perpetual was the thing. So like you didn't even have recurring, right? You didn't even have per se. So you like sell 300 million bucks and you know, it's just perpetual and people get to use it forever or or whatever it is. And then that went into recurring or seatbased, which gave rise to companies like Zora, and now we're seeing the inflection. So maybe you can walk a little bit through kind of this in relation to to those shifts.\n\nYeah. So the way that I think about it, there's really three eras of monetization. You're talking there's the on-prem era where it's like perpetual licenses, then the cloud era, which was seat subscription, and now I would call the AI era or the value era. I think the key thing that I now understand, again, I didn't understand this 5 years ago, but it's kind of become clear now, is that what's actually happening is in, is in the late 90s, the move to the cloud actually created the conditions for seats and subscriptions. So basically when you move from like the value of your software in the on-prem era is you literally buy software, you install it, maybe you pay a maintenance fee, someone comes and updates it, you know, physically every year or something like that. The value is like the software and what it does. It's just like, it's like you pay a flat price. Okay. In the cloud era now everything is, is like the value of the software shifts. Instead of this like software living on prem, it's now like who in my org has access to a common repository set of data. So in Salesforce's case, it's like how many sales reps have access to the common shared, you know, system of record for our sales deals in our sales pipeline. So the value of the software scales as your org scales. Um, and you can try to do things like make the software more valuable for individual users, but like roughly the kind of value metric is how many people have access to it. Now what's happening in AI is actually fundamentally something different, which is AI is changing the value prop of software, you know, it's kind of doing two things at once. One, it's like, it's like the software is not doing work on your behalf, and so the core value of the software is not who in my or has access to the data, it's like what can this software do for me, like, you know, can it write code for me, can it like defer tickets or something like in a customer support use case, so like AI is doing work, and then the second thing that's happening is if you follow that line of thinking, also the number of people who have access to that system is shrinking because you're like able to get efficiency gains, and so the f, so what's happening is for these SaaS businesses, they're like their core metric before was number of people, that's like kind of trending down, maybe it's staying flat, and then at the same time the value is now the work that the software is doing on my behalf, which doesn't monetize in the like scaling with users way, and so fundamentally that's what's happening in this moment, and so because the value is changing, it's opening the door for a new commercial models.\n\nOkay. So, I think you've already partially just answered what I'm going to ask, but I just think it's worth to call out. So, the idea of usage based billing isn't new. Um, it's been around for a long time in infrastructure, and and the adage was simple, which is if you have an app, you do perceive.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd if you have infrastructure, you do consumption, and that's because it's tied to like a computer science resource like storage or or whatever.\n\nUm, is that still true or is that what's being changed? And based on what you just said, it seems like it's changing.\n\nYeah, it's definitely changing. I think what I, the way I always like to think about it is like software, like everyone talks about are you pricing to value, and like I think that's like kind of what's coming to the four. So what I actually see happening in a lot of these SaaS businesses is what I would call like the rise of hybrid business models where you have a per user fee and then you also have variable costs. And so I think what that does is it does a bunch of different things. One, it very much feels like almost like a bridge commercial technology. It's like moving to pure consumption is actually kind of a challenging thing to do because seats and subscriptions is really simple and easy to understand. Usage is not nearly as simple, and it's really, it's much harder to predict for good reasons. It's like, you know, you don't know how much value you're going to get. If I get more value, I pay more. But that predictability hurts like a lot of companies, and so they like to have this like bridge model of seats and users kind of almost serve like a platform fee and like a anchor points like our minimum of our revenue, and then you have this upper, you have this upside capture in the value case, and so what we're seeing a lot in SaaS, like big established SaaS players like Salesforce, for instance, you know, they went and like added this agent force stuff, they still have per user access fees, but now the agent force is this variable cost on up that allows them to like, if the agents actually are providing value, now my business will scale as you get more value from it, even if you don't.\n\nsystems team and we couldn't do it, and it just turned out to be really hard, and I can't tell you how often I hear this story play out with these really good infrastructure companies want to do usage based billing and then they can't, and it's just not super obvious. It wasn't obvious to me then, and it's probably not obvious to a lot of people listening on like why it's so hard. So can you maybe give a mental model of why this stuff is so difficult to build?\n\nYeah. So there's a couple of things that are interesting to think about. So the first is that when you're doing usage, I think there's, there's this key thing that happens. So like you're an engineer, uh, you know, you're consuming cloud infrastructure, as soon as you turn on that machine, you kind of have started this meter, and it's like starting to spin, and it's starting to like accrue money. The challenge with that is, especially with a lot of these AI tools, is that meter can be grow very, very fast. You can spend, if you like, I always like to say, like if I wanted to, I could go spend a million dollars on OpenAI in like three hours if I wanted to on the API, and so what that means is that because you can theoretically have unbounded amount to spend in very short periods of time, you aren't just like doing counting statistics over that usage at some monthly time scale. It actually needs to approach like a real-time problem. And so the first like reason it's hard is because actually if you, if you think about usage billing as this like unbounded spend problem, you need to have like a near-real-time system that can detect when you're, you know, like have a rogue process that's like consuming a bunch of money. So like a a good example is we, we talked to Segment five years ago, and they were one of the first pioneers of this stuff, and they had some small startup in India with like $3,000 in their business in their account. They turned on Segment, and then they sent them a bill at the end of the month for $80,000, and that was because someone on the team accidentally hooked up their CDP to their entire traffic pattern. And so, you know, Segment didn't collect on that, but that's like $80,000 of breakage that they're never going to get back. And so it what it means is that the billing system can't be thought of as this like once a month process, which is kind of the natural thing. These, it's like solving the billing problem accurately if you don't have a time constraint actually is kind of a simple problem as long as you have high-quality data, but solving it in real\n\n\nTime makes it really hard. I think the second thing that's really important is, especially in this age right now, that your pricing model looks static because you publish it on a web page, but in most cases, it's highly dynamic. And you know, you've worked in enterprise sales, every sales deal looks slightly different. And so handling the complexity of all those edge cases is really, really challenging to do in a general way. And so what ends up happening is, we're talking to a company last week, a public company. They're in like a billion dollars in usage-based spend through enterprise contracts. All of that billion dollars is handled by hand. Why is it handled by hand? Because every single enterprise contract is different. It has a different amount of discounts and has a different amount of this customer negotiate a discount on this line item and this one on a different one. Creating the general rules engine that can handle all that complexity is really, I mean, it's honestly just very boring work and very hard. And so what ends up happening is that company in the early days would choose to build it themselves because it looks simple. They have one contract that looks weird. Flash forward six years and now they have a thousand contracts that look weird and now they're all being handled by hand. And so that's those are the kinds of things that start to break. And then I think the last thing that's just important is, aside from being real time and handling that flexibility, is that the data scale. In truth, what you want to do is you want to preserve optionality on how you price, which means that you need to store a bunch of data that a lot of which you won't actually use to compute an invoice. But let's say that you like want to change pricing in the future. If you haven't stored and retained that data in like a financially accurate way, suddenly you're left with like really broken data pipelines and you like have a data that's accurate to like, you know, 99% accurate. The problem with that is the 99% accurate accuracy is fraud in a financial sense. And so you actually have to have really golden data pipelines in order to solve this problem at, especially at public company scale. You know, one thing that I didn't appreciate was how strategic usage-based billing is to the actual company implementing it, like a lot more than like say recurring or perpetual or something like it actually becomes part of the business plan. So maybe you can just talk very crisply, like let's say, let's say someone listening to this podcast is running a business and they're thinking about usage-based business, like how you think about that as strategic to the business.\n\nYeah. So I think the easiest way to think about it is that it kind of goes back to this pricing to value concept. So you are now linking your pricing, your revenue model to the value that you generate. What that means is that the value chain starts with the enterprise seller is selling your software and it's selling in a value case. Now that enterprise seller is probably selling like a credit buy for a million dollars of credits that spend down as the customer starts using your product. Let's say it's a data warehouse or something like that. The sales process is fundamentally very different than in a seat subscription model where you take a million dollars up front and you just like kind of recognize the revenue divide by 12 every month. In a usage world, actually now that seller doesn't get paid commission until the product is actually used. So now that seller's entire incentive structure, assuming you have a reasonable comp.\n\nYeah. Exactly. Right.\n\nWhich by the way people get wrong all the time is an ex. Yeah. Exactly. Actually that's an exception. Most people just like they they get the worst of both worlds. They basically pay you out for the million dollar contract and then they they only get to recognize revenue when the usage is acred. So yes I uh and by the way this just I the reason I I I actually interjected it's just important to realize like how much this impacts the business broadly including things like sales comp, sales behavior, post sales, customer success.\n\nExactly right. Well, so I think and and I think the key is again, it's about how do you generate and capture value, but the value generation starts in the like office of the CRO, then the product has to come and actually fulfill the thing and the customers have to actually use it and figure out how to use it. That's like a success thing, it's a product thing. It's an engineering thing. And then finally at the end of the month, quarter, whatever, you get to recognize revenue. And so what it means is that usage kind of I think of it very in a like pure sense. It's like, oh, we finally have perfectly aligned incentives with our customers, right? They they only pay us when they use it. We only, you know, like our sales team is incentivized to not get like a a user that just gives us a bunch of money and then doesn't use the product. Actually, they're incentivized to find good customers for us. Product is incentivized to build product that actually drives usage. Finance is now able to like recognize revenue in a way that corresponds to the value that we create. In a theoretical sense, everything is beautiful. The problem is we have like 30 years of Silicon Valley where various parts of the company were actually not incentivized to put more value into the product. A good example is again, I love Dropbox. Drew, you're an incredible person. But the commercial model of Dropbox incentivized it was a team-based thing, number of users. It incentivized us to get really good at getting a wall-to-wall deployment, did not incentivize us at all to drive incremental usage. In fact, in a very literal sense, you didn't want people to maximize their their usage of quota because the customers at the P99 of usage actually were margin negative. So, in fact, like your product is actually like we want to get you to have like seven files in there, not 7,000. And I think in a usage-based model, it kind of theoretically aligns everyone's incentives toward the same thing. But the problem is that most business units don't, they're like fundamentally that's not how they operate today. And so when you're adopting a usage-based model, I think the way I like to put it to my team is when we're talking to a sales deal, if I can't talk to the CEO of that company, it's not a real deal. Because the CEO has to be like, I'm going to take the hard path. I'm going to build a company around like value creation and capture, and I'm going to make sure that sales is aligned to it. I'm going to make sure that customer support is aligned to it. I'm make sure product is finance, all that stuff. That's a business transformation. That's a big deal. And fundamentally, it's just not how most business in Silicon Valley work today. And so, when I'm thinking about like advising that theoretical company about this, my literal first recommendation is like, are you ready? Are you going to are you going to commit to it? Because if you're not, then you can't just like change your pricing and have it magically work out. You actually have to change all the incentives along the way in order for it to stick. So, so what is that punch list for like a new CEO that's like, \"Okay, I'm going to do usage-based billing, like what are like the top five concerns?\"\n\nYeah.\n\nJust to give them a a peak at the the implications of impact to the company, sales and compensation I think is number one.\n\nSo the the comp plan for sales, comp plan for sales. Then the second thing is the role of sales. The comp plan and then also what is the territory, like is sales start or end when the contract is signed? Does it change the roles of like pre-sales and post sales? Definitely. A lot of these companies don't even have a distinction between those two roles or they have a person who's kind of kind of play both sides because the pre-sales job is like honestly it's mostly like vetting some quick requirements. But if you sell a million-dollar deal that gets no usage, that's like essentially you've booked fake revenue. And and it kind of goes into the second thing like I mean it's it's real it's real spend. But if that customer then turns after you're one on $0, that's like a hugely negative thing for your business. And then the other nice thing about these businesses, I mean, you know this better than most is the beauty of usage is that if you can find that true product market fit, it just compounds in a way, it creates this incredible flywheel of value that a seat subscription model can't even touch. And yet it requires that you build every part of your customer journey into that. So one would be sales comp. Second would be like role of go to market team. Do you split the AE role or do you have like a unified team? I know a lot of companies that kind of just keep the same rep on it for years.\n\nWhat happens to CS in this case?\n\nIt's a good question. I think in a lot of cases the role of CS is really much thinner than than you would otherwise have. I think you really do want a team who's deeply embedded in the success of the company, but most CS folks on the label aren't doing enough to justify that. And the real successful people is actually more of like a technical support rep, SA type of person who's, for instance, we are a consumer of a lot of these like usage-based companies. The best ones, our most valuable person in an entire company is a freaking SA and frequently it's like a field CTO helping us discover ways of saving us money, like that person's job in a very real sense is to cause me to spend less money per unit time because what they know is that if I rightsize my spend, I'm going to be a much happier customer for much longer. One trend that I've seen in line with this is like CS teams more and more are starting to get comped or guided towards KPIs that are like gross churn and sees set as opposed to like an expansion number for all the reasons that you've said. So like their job is to just make sure that like the customers are using it, the customers are happy, they're not going away, but not necessarily to actually drive the uses specifically because that's what the sales teams are have to do to align with the comp the.\n\nExactly. Right. And so I would like focus on that area. The other two areas that I would I would focus on if I'm this theoretical CEO with a punch card. First is really make sure your product and engineering team is kind of really deeply understanding what I think of as like the core value metric at Facebook. You know, they always had like very clear metric alignment. They use that to drive like really massive things. I think that that same growth-mindedness you need to bring into your product or because you need them to be really focused on what the core value metric is for the customer both so they can communicate it to the customer but so that as the customer uses the product it encourages the use of more of that value metric because ultimately that is now your revenue, like in a very literal sense that metric is your revenue and so actually in a lot of ways your product team becomes almost like a revenue driving team in a way that in seat subscription you kind of had enough buffer that you could kind like be like, okay, product's probably value in these usage-based businesses, it's completely objective how the value that your product team is driving, which I think it favors a very specific type of product manager and product team, but I think you need to be very careful there and then I think the last thing that I think is really important is as the CEO, as the entire team, you need to be looking at those core metrics much like a Facebook would. So like in a seat subscription business, you can kind of run your revenue org kind of lazily, we are like basically not looking at how they're using the product. You're kind of just like evaluating it close to renewal or something like that. In a lot of these true usage businesses, the CEO, the CRO, the entire exec team is looking at core user usage on a weekly basis, sometimes a daily basis. They're obsessing over like, oh, this new workload came online and our largest customer just increased their, you know, the slope of their burndown curve by 2%. What happened? Is that good increase in spend? Is that bad? And and you need to understand that. And that what that means is that the finance team needs to be almost more of like a strategic data provider and also operate at a totally different clock speed. Like a finance team that's used to working quarterly, monthly is like orders of magnitude too slow for this world. And so what you need to do is you need to like have a make sure your finance team is ready to essentially become a data org because they own the source of truth for that usage and spend data at the end of the day. And they need to be able to provide it back to their teams really, really fast and and have like complete mastery over it. And if they don't, then what that means is that the sales rep is going to kind of look at like a a lagging dashboard of like kind of speculative quality data and they're not going to be able to do their job. They're not going to be able to go, oh, customer Acme Corp, like why did you bring on this new workload? Your spend is going to expire in month eight instead of month 12. Like is that your intention? Is that a should I be happy about that or should I be really sad and help you take that workload off? I think that's the kind of thing that your finance team in a very real sense has to kind of become that data purveyor. I think they all want to do it, but they're not necessarily equipped to do it.\n\nDo you think all software companies go to usage-based billing or is there a dividing line that we should be thinking? I'll tell you I am surprised by how many companies that would traditionally be see companies are going to usage-based billing. So I'm just kind of wondering if there's like a like a a rough rule here or.\n\nYeah. So I think infrar like pure usage and I think that just is the model. I think it just works perfect to the extent that like your software just becomes a playground for agents. I think it opens up the possibility for that to be pure usage because the positive benefit of subscriptions is predictability and like it's simple. Agents don't give a if it's simple. Like they they can make real-time decision. If you're like purely that layer, I would guess that becomes pure usage in some form. I would say the layer where humans are actually interacting. I think the dominant model at least for the next couple years is going to be hybrid. You know, in my head, I'm like a value purist. I think it's very rare that a business's true value is mapped to the number of people who have access to it. That's a dangerous game to play because, you know, talking about companies being smaller and smaller. What that's really just saying is that your maximum value of your software is going to be quite low. I think the truth is you got to have a mix, a hybridized one. It's very rare software that\n\n\nYou can charge like\nBloomberg terminal like 20K per person\nper year. That's like very little software can do that. I\nthink in reality it's going to be this hybrid mess and I think B\nTOC, the way I like to think about it, is B to C opts for consumption\nbecause you don't want to ask the\nconsumer to make a purchase decision\nthat often. You want them to kind of\nautonomically purchase and then move on\nwith their life. You know, sometimes, like\nwhy isn't Netflix usage based? And I'm\nlike, well, because that would basically\nrequire that every time a customer\nlogs in to go watch something, they have\nto make a purchase decision. That's\ntoo much cognitive load. So for B\nTOC, I think subscription is great. B to\nSMB, I would say it's going to be a\nhybrid. And then enterprise, I think\nwe'll just become closer to pure usage\nbecause basically a scaling fee that\ngrows with your headcount is kind of\nincentive disaligned with most\nCFOs. But then secondarily, the good\nthing about large enterprise deployments\nis you can kind of do quite a long PC process to kind of rightsize the\nvalue. Like one of the most interesting\nthings that we see with agentic pricing, is these agentic pricing\nthat sells to large enterprises. What\nthey'll do is they'll use the PC period\nto essentially run a mini McKenzie\ncase study where at the end of it\nthey're like, \"Cool, look, this metric that\nwe said we'd push down, it's down 27%.\nThat 27% means you get to reduce\nheadcount by x%, and we're going to\ncharge you a percentage of that.\" And\nessentially what they're doing is\nthey're using the PC to essentially\nrightsize the spend for them. And that\nkind of complex pricing is really only\navailable in the enterprise. And so I\nthink that's like the larger enterprise\nis where the more exotic, weird\npricing, outcome-based pricing is going\nto really take off.\nIt seems like AI is taking over\neverything.\nExactly. Like I think we can kind of\nturn software into infrastructure for\nagents. Who cares what the UI or\nwhatever of Slack is? Actually, Slack is\njust a messaging protocol that\nconnects these different things. The\nvalue of the agent is how many messages\nit can send down the wire.\nOkay. So let's go back to this\ntheoretical CEO. So let's say that\nyou're trying to change your org to get\nready for this sort of thing. Are you\nseeing any emerging patterns or do you\nhave any emerging recommendations when\nit comes to actual roles?\nOne of my favorite conversations is to\ntalk to companies about their pricing\ncounseling. My main thing is like you\ndon't want a pricing counsel. You want a\npricing dictator. You want someone who\nis telling you what the right pricing\nis. And that doesn't mean that they\ndon't have their people telling them what their view of revenue or finance or whatever.\nBut you do need a centralized authority\nfor kind of hammering this stuff\nthrough because what I can tell you is,\nyou know, I've seen enough of these transitions. The sales team doesn't want\nto be retrained. The sales team doesn't\nwant to have to rethink their comp\nplans. Like that's just fundamentally friction to them.\nAnd if you don't do that work and you\ndon't have a really strong central\nplayer who can kind of ramrod this stuff\nthrough and have a vision for it, then\nwhat happens is the stuff kind of stalls\nout. And so what will happen is the CEO\nand the board might be totally aligned,\nlike, \"Here's what we got to go do,\" and\nthen they say, \"Okay, cool, you know, pricing\ncouncil, make this happen.\" The challenge\nis that you have to make changes. You\nhave to make compromises across at least\nthree different boundaries. You have to\nmake a compromise between what the field\nwants to and knows how to sell and like\nliterally your technical architecture\nfor properly counting and like actually\nselling that thing, like actually pricing\nthe thing. You need to make compromises\nbetween that and like actually how you\nmake recognized revenue. And so because\nthese, in some sense, the office of CFO,\nthe office of the CPO, the office of the\nCRO all have slightly different\nobjective functions, if you don't have\nthat centralized power who can kind of\nmake changes that crosscut, what ends up\nhappening is this stuff just devolves\ninto business transformation hell, and pricing decisions sit on the\nsidelines. And then the other thing\nthat's happening is your competition is\nmoving really, really quickly. You can't\nsit on this stuff for quarters and\nyears. It used to be like the rule of\nthumb was you don't change your\nfundamental pricing model more than once\nevery five years. Agent Force, like\nliterally Salesforce, one of the biggest\ncompanies in the world, changes\nfundamental pricing structure three\ntimes in the past 12 months. Now, that's\ninsane to me. Like I don't know how\nthey retrained their sales team. And you\nknow, maybe it's maybe it's going well,\nmaybe it's not. But the point is that\nsome of the largest companies in the\nworld are moving at historical speeds.\nAnd so if you're the one sitting there,\nstartups on the one hand are kind of\nlike cannibalizing or rewriting your\nmarket, and you're sitting on a pricing\nchange that you're going to sit and\nyou're going to do a 9-month case study\nand then roll it out after six to nine\nmonths. You're going to be like a year\nand a half behind. And by the time you\neven go live, your pricing model is\ngoing to be outmoded. And I think that's\njust a really challenging position\nto be as a CEO. So you really do need\nthat central force and that kind of that\nwill to kind of like hard deadlines\nare actually your friend here.\nOtherwise, like you're going to find\nthat there's a million reasons why this\nshould not happen in your organization.\nTo that point, where are we in this\nindustry shift? Is it still very early?\nAre we in the middle, or is it already\nkind of late? Like, if you're not\nthinking about this, are you behind?\nI definitely think you're behind because\nyou just inserted an insanely expensive\nline item into your bottom line in the\nform of AI. And uh and if your CFO isn't\nscreaming at you now, then probably\neither the AI is useless for you, which, okay, interesting, or you're not\npaying attention to your cogs. And\nso you have to be engaging with it. Now,\nthe beautiful thing about this moment is\nno one knows the there's no right answer\nat this moment. I think of pricing\nmodels as kind of Darwinian. We've\nentered a moment where like\nfundamentally the ice caps have\nmelted, and it's really unclear what's\ngoing to be optimal for this new\nclimate. And so you see a ton of\nexploration. You even see exploration\nwithin, take a large company. Take\nSalesforce behind the scenes. They have\ntheir list price. They have like a\nthousand variants in production, trying\ndifferent things out, looking for the\none that's going to stick and drive the\npositive flywheel. And so\nyou're in the exploration phase, but you\ngot to get ready. You got to you got to\nkind of retool yourself to be in\nexploration mode versus optimization\nmode. Basically, sometimes people are\nlike, \"What's the right pricing model?\"\nAnd I'm like, \"That's a category error.\"\nLike there is no right pricing model.\nThe only thing I know is agility is the\nonly thing that's rewarded in this\nenvironment.\nYou know, one thing that I've seen\nemerge is especially kind of product-led\ncompanies, they're almost using the\npricing as a strategic weapon to decide\nbetween like distribution and margin, and\nthey dial it up and down, which for me\nis very interesting because there was\nthis old adage which is like you can\nnever increase price. Yeah. You know,\nit's like you couldn't do that. And so\nyou're always like just do the highest\nprice, don't worry about distribution.\nBut now I see it all the time, like\ncompanies are literally just like giving\naway a whole bunch. And so can you talk\nto is that a bad idea? The old adage is\nthat you can't increase price, that does\nthat still exist? Like how have things\nshifted? Because for me this is very\nvery new.\nIt's it is very new\nand it seems to be very effective by the\nway.\nI think a lot of things are happening at\nonce. But I think the fundamental nice\nthing about Silicon Valley in this\nmoment is that the value is literally\nchanging week over week if you're built\non top of one of these fundamental LLMs.\nA month ago you couldn't offer just\nincrease the price.\nExactly. Right. And so you just call it\na product launch, increase the price. So\nfor me that's really interesting\nactually. One of the things that's\nreally fascinating is you'll see\ncompanies that are actually their\npricing model is like a cost-plus model\nin this moment where basically they just\nfix their margin, and then they basically\nsay, \"Look, we just we're going to be fixed\nat 20% margin,\" and you're like, \"Well,\nthat's a horrible business.\" Well, it's\nnot a horrible business if what your\ngoal is is to get complete ubiquity\nacross the market and then do some kind\nof much more refined pricing and\npackaging so that you can kind of\nincrease your margin over time. And what\nthey're just betting on is a the market\nis huge and growing really fast. By\npreserving a fixed margin, they\nbasically have enough capital to keep\nfunding the next layer or next\ngeneration of models and stuff. And then\nthat also just puts a ton of pressure on\ntheir competitors who don't have\nbottomless coffers. And then that's the\nother thing that I would just say right\nnow is that fundamentally you think\nabout pricing and value as like that's\nhow you evaluate public companies. But\nfor a lot of these private companies,\nyou kind of have to understand that the\ntruth is that if they are correct, then\nthe market is as big as they think it is\ngoing to be. That means the market is\ngoing to 10x in the next couple years.\nAnd so fundamentally, they're using\ncapital as a weapon to kill competitors\nto gain market share, and they'll figure\nit out down the line. And I think that's\nlike honestly it's a pretty good bet in\nthis moment. I mean the winners seem to\nbe truly winning hard, and it's like you\nsee this weird thing where the companies\nthat are at the top are somehow\naccelerating. You know, it's like actually\nit feels like it feels like a true\nexponential. It feels it feels like I'll\ntell you it feels like the early\ninternet where brand moes work because\nthe markets are so large, and so you have\na leader, and as soon as they're a\ncategory leader, it seems it breaks paro,\nthey get 80% of the market, and we've saw\nthis in image, we saw this in speech,\nwe've seen this in language models, we've\nseen this in code models, we've seen it\nin code editors, and so the internet went\nthis way as well, right? You have like,\nyou know, whatever, 10 online shopping\ncompanies, one becomes the brand leader,\nand just because it's growing so quickly\nis what comes to mind. I don't think\nwe've actually seen dynamics like this\nin 30 years.\nThe thing that I, you know, kind of get\nfrom talking to the experts, the people\nwho've been in here since like, you\nknow, the whole time is that the level\nof dynamism, you know, obviously the\nproduct layer, it's like obvious, but\nthe same thing is happening in terms of\nmarket dynamics, competitive dynamics,\nspend, you know, and so the thing I\nI would just say is that it truly is\nwild. And then the other thing is we're\nalso riding these like deprecation\ncurves of cost, too. I think the play of\nlike saturating market is seems really\nreally smart. In some sense that to me\nis a positive argument for preserving\nthe subscription part because\nsubscription is simple. Subscription is\nbasic. I think that's actually why a lot\nof the AI companies initially went to\nmarket with that. Now that they\nunderstand their cost dynamics a little\nbit and the market seems a little more\nforgiving, they're kind of hybridizing a\nlittle bit. But I also do see people\nusing price and packaging as a way of\nlike competing in the market and kind of\nbeing like, \"Look, we can offer this in\nthis novel way.\" And I think it to your\npoint about brand, that is saying\nsomething to the consumer that is\nestablishing a brand that we are in, we\nare in the same, we're playing for the\nsame team, and um, and I think the smart\ncompanies are using that.\nIt's hard for me not to draw parallels\nto the internet. With the internet, you\nknow, marginal cost of distribution goes\nto zero, you have all this blow up, and\nit all felt very similar. The one big\ndifference is we didn't know how to\nmonetize the internet. So at this time\nit's almost like, you know, the same level\nof growth, but like actually we figured\nout how to monetize it. And it seems to\nme just just chat, you know, whether um, um,\nkeep me honest here. It seems to me that\nlike usage-based\napproaches are are are fundamental to\nthat monetization strategy. So it's\nalmost like it's just kind of\nfundamental to this this this AI wave.\nYeah. Yes. The way I think about it is\nif you're selling software, you are\nselling, let's say that you're ultimately\nselling to a CFO, whatever, whoever, bottom\nline it is that CFO, their number one\nheadcount, their number one expense item\nis headcount, probably their number two\nis AWS, which is usage based, so they have\nhad 15 plus years to figure out how to\nmanage costs in a variable cost world,\nwhereas in in the like back in the early\nparts of the internet, usage would have\nbeen unthinkable because no one\nunderstood how to even think about or\nconceive. We didn't even know how to like\nmonetize. We basically ended up with ads,\nwhich is like doesn't help anybody.\nNo. Exactly.\nExcept for like, you know, maybe one\ncompany.\nExactly. Right. And I think now we have\nall these technologies, and then the\nother thing is is that AWS, Snowflake,\nData Bricks, these companies have\nsocialized us to the idea of variable\nvariable valuable variable spend. And I\nthink that is like it's actually\nbecoming it's like it's very easy to say\nthis is value aligned to you. Actually,\nI literally as I was driving down here,\nI saw that Intercom, they have this Finn\nproduct, which is an AI agent, and it it\ndoes auto resolution of things, like auto\nresolution of customer support. They're\nlike, \"Cool, we have benchmark this like\nindustry standard to 65% resolution of\nthings.\" Awesome. That means you get to\nlike not have a huge support team, and\nit's charged in a in a resolution\nbased way. And then they went a kicker,\nand then to the brand building. They're\nlike, \"Look, you, if you use this in\nproduction for, I think it's like 12\nweeks, and your resolution rate is below\n65%, we'll pay you a million dollars.\nLike we'll give you a million dollars of\nspend back.\" And that's the kind of\nthing that's like that's a huge bet for\nthat company. That's a B to SMB\nbusiness. Like if if they're able to\nsell that message to like hundreds of\nthousands, millions of small businesses,\nthat means that those businesses are\nready for usage, which I think\nhistorically has been the argument for\nwhy like usage is too complex. I just\nthink that the world has complexified,\nand now everyone kind of gets it. And in\nthe agent world, agents actually don't\ncare about\n\n\nComplexity. They just care about optimal price. And so that they're going to favor that kind of model.\n\nSo do you think it's fair to say we're in a new super cycle?\n\nThis is just like, you know, SaaS changed the billing model. This changes the billing model, and that billing model is more central and strategic to the business than we've ever seen before. And so if anybody is in this wave, they should really be thinking about how they use usage-based billing to their advantage.\n\nHow do you architect your business around that process? And I think the example for the engineers who are listening, I think that's really telling. At most companies, let's say you had like a long, a key database query, and you found a way to make it 50% more efficient. You would just ship that overnight. You'd get like a promotion to become a principal engineer tomorrow, right? At a company that's a user-based company, take like a Snowflake. That engineer is not allowed to ship that optimization. Why? Because basically, if you decrease the cost of computation by 50% overnight, suddenly your revenue on your compute and storage dropped by 50%. Now it may be cleaner revenue, and it's probably better for the business and the customers in the long term, but you actually have to think about that. That engineer has direct control over revenue in that scenario.\n\nSo what do they do? They meter it out over a quarter. They make it 10% this quarter, 10% blah blah blah. That fundamental way of thinking about the world is fundamentally quite different than seat subscription. And so, especially if you've, I think all the AI companies kind of get it natively, like they're just like, yeah, of course I'm pricing this way. It's like the only way that makes any sense. I think the where we see the most kind of hesitancy or education is in those companies that are pretty big. Maybe they have hundreds of millions in ARR, and they're trying to think about how do I make the transition, and that's where I would say, like, really think carefully about how you're constructing your data and your team and who's empowered to kind of make sure you make the transition because it just, it's not as simple as just like picking a new pricing model. Like, actually, it kind of requires you to think fundamental aspects of every part of your business.\n\n[Music]\n",
