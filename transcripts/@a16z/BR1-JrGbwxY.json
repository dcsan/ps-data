  "cleanText": "6 months ago was some random college kid in a dorm and now I feel like I'm at the center of the tech universe. There's something like really strange and special happening here. I heard someone call it Riz marketing, which is a compliment, but they're like, \"I hate this RZ marketing.\" We wrote our first lines of code 10 weeks ago. All of a sudden, we have like over a million dollars of enterprise revenue coming in. Roy's probably the top 0.1% in the world in terms of knowing how to distribute. Is this viral? Does this have viral fit? If any company in the world has a marketing team and the head of marketing does not have 100,000, at least 100,000 followers like you, you need to replace them. Like, like the game has changed. You're converting this like awareness and eyeballs into money dollars. I might as well just quintuple down on every single crazy belief thought I have and just live the most interesting life ever. I'm all in on building companies there. There's no way I can do anything else.\n\nRoy, the man, the myth, the legend, the man of the moment. Cluely is the current thing. Yes. How does it feel the announcement the other day?\n\nA lot of love, a little bit of hate. Maybe more the middle. Um, and any reactions? How do you react to this?\n\nI mean, it's pretty crazy. Uh, I think, like, literally 6 months ago, I was some random college kid in a dorm and now I feel like I'm at the center of the tech universe. And um, it's the more astonishing thing is how correct my assumptions on virality have been. I think it's growing increasingly clear that uh, people on X are behind, and there's such a very extremely small intersection of people who understand how developed the algorithm is on like Instagram, TikTok, and people on tech like Twitter, LinkedIn, X, and there's just such a small intersection that it's inevitable that my predictions will be right. And um, it's been crazy to see that play out in real time. Yeah. Um, Elon's reaching out. Meta is offering a billion dollar acquisition offer. Brian, we said, you know, not to do it. Of course. Of course. Of course. I mean, to the moon. To the moon. What is your reaction seeing this play out?\n\nLook, Roy, this is fantastic. It was uh, it's so interesting. I remember right before the announcement, you had already sent me the video 24 hours ago, like, \"Bro, this is this is what we're going to show.\" And I was like, \"Okay, like this this is great and I think it's going to do well.\" I didn't think it would do that well and I didn't think it would create that much, you know, controversy, but I also I think underestimated how positive people will view this. There's a lot of metaanalysis on you out there, which is like really, really cool. And there are people who are going like two to three layers deep. And I've actually read something that like linked a meta analysis of a16z with how, you know, with Cluely and how there's like the sort of fungeibility of thoughts and things like that, which I have no idea what they're talking about. So, it's just been incredible. People doing literary criticism. No, I'm not kidding. There's literally a guy who wrote like fungeibility of thoughts with A16Z.\n\nCluely, people always overreaded the stuff. They're like, \"Oh, this had this master plan. A16Z is trying to do this whole whole space.\" Yeah.\n\nNo, don't, don't, don't tell them, Erik. We are playing 40 chess here. So, 10 threads analyzing the left hand handshake. It's like, guys, come on. I I wanted to Some of the haters I I tweeted something was talking to Brian. I tweeted how you feel about Cluely is how you feel about yourself. But I deleted it cuz I didn't want to trigger people on Twitter. I'll talk on a podcast. Maybe I'll get clipped to Twitter. But I didn't want to inflame, but uh, but it was fascinating. Fascinating to see. Um, so maybe I want to go back to the to the beginning because this isn't a story that has been told a lot. You know, we will be talking about the Amazon interview, but maybe let's go back even further when we think through the, you know, where you are now. Think talk about like the the threads of the through lines from your childhood to that that can help make sense of who you are and and kind of this moment. I think um, from birth, like the most character-defining feature of me has been like attention grabbing and provocative. Um, like, like this played out elementary, middle, and high school. I was always like, like I had a camp of people that loved me and a camp of people that hated me. I was like always the boldest, like I I would say the craziest. Everything that was on my mind, just no filter. I would say it. And um, this ended up with a lot of people liking me and a lot of people just really disliking me. And I think like, like things culminated senior year of high school. Like I I I I did well into I did well in school. I got accepted to Harvard early and then uh, later that year I was just always doing crazy and I uh, snuck out of a school field trip. Um, passed curfew, like the the the police had to come and escort me back cuz we were out at like 2 a.m. and we were all like 16, 17, 18. Um, and then uh, I got a suspension for that and that was like when the camp of like Roy haters took to took the storm and and reported everything everywhere and it ended up getting me rescinded from Harvard. Um, and then that that that kind of started my journey of uh, I think wanting to actually swing big at building companies. At that point, I felt like my life took such a crazy turn. Uh, for for context, my parents literally run like a college admissions consulting company. So, we literally teach kids how to get into get into Harvard and the the youngest son of the company like, like gets resented from Harvard. It's like it's like the worst thing ever. So, so we we decided let's let's keep this quiet. You you you still have the same test scores and application, everything. Maybe next year you'll get into a different school. Um, so I I spent like an entire year at home and that that was like I underestimated how mentally tormenting that would be. Like I'm probably the most extroverted person you might have ever met in your life. I I cannot stay maybe like 8 hours without talking to someone. Um, and and to spend a year alone, like it it made me think like, \"Man, my life is so crazy. I might as well just quintuple down on every single crazy belief thought I have and just live the most interesting life ever.\" So that was like the moment where I decided like I'm all in on building companies there. There's no way I can do anything else.\n\nI was wondering if you were going to have a moment of like, \"Oh, you know, this has set me back in some ways. Maybe I should, you know, reform or or or tame it down.\" But you took the opposite of like, \"No.\"\n\nYeah. I mean, this is who I am and it's going to work out. Yeah. You just sit in a room by yourself for like, like 12 months and and all of a sudden your craziest thoughts become logical and there there's no one else, like the the echo chamber is you in your brain and uh, it it amplifies it amplifies everything. And I think that that's the reason why I am like the the person that I am today and willing to make the bets that I am today. Later I I go to community college in California at the behest of my parents. Um, I think California, this is like a middle ground. California, I have the I have the chance to build a company and community college, like I have the chance to get the education that my Asian parents always dreamed of. Um, so so I I I do that and then later I I I get into Columbia and of like I I have to go to Columbia for at least a semester to appease my parents. Um, I go to Columbia and the first thing I'm thinking is like, \"Can I find a co-founder and a wife?\" Like those are the only two things that I'm looking for in college and uh, still looking for the wife, but um, on pretty much the first day, that's when I met Neil, my co-founder, started hacking on a bunch of things and the one thing that worked was uh, the earliest version of Cluely. So, and were your parents ever trying to reform you or moderate you or were they kind of like, \"Hey, Roy is going to be Roy?\" And like almost probably like every single day of my life until I got into Harvard, then they calm down and they're like, \"Wow, this kid really made it.\" And then when I got kicked from Harvard again, they were like on my ass a lot until I got into Columbia again and they're like, \"Wow.\" Like I I like, like after all this, he gets back into the Ivys. Like I guess I really can't trust him. Um, and his unorthodox swings will will be home runs.\n\nSo you you mentioned before that uh, your parents, they will love you no matter what.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nHowever, I am curious what they think now.\n\nMan, it's crazy how how lax they've gotten since I got back into Columbia. Like now they're okay with anything. When I told them, \"Hey, mom, I'm dropping out to do this.\" Like she's like, \"Oh, like okay,\" you know, like I expected it like, like why, why didn't you drop out sooner? Why did it take you a semester and a half? Cuz at this point, I was like convincing my co-founder to drop out with me. And she's like, \"Man, like took it long enough.\" So, they're like totally on board with all the crazy that I do.\n\nWow. The um, one of the things we were talking about in context of going viral, I heard you say is that Twitter is two years behind Instagram.\n\nYeah.\n\nBehind the other platforms. Talk a little bit about, well, first, just like when your sort of provocativeness sort of translated over to Twitter or just like the digital medium, like how did that strategy evolve and let's talk about the difference in the platform.\n\nI think, and this, this, this goes way back, but but but many years ago when YouTube first came out as a platform, this was like the turning point of everything. This democratized essentially content and now you weren't paying for commercials uh, and and the visibility and and publicity and content was not gated by amount of money you're willing to spend on ads or or or TV space. It's just gated by the quality of content. And 5 years ago when TikTok came out and and short form algorithms really started taking over, that shifted the the the the frame once again. So now it's not about how much good content you make. It's literally just about how much content can you make. There is simply not enough good content out there for the average person to consume. Which is why you see like, like, like the same brain rot reels over and over and over again, over and over again. You see the same Minecraft parkour video over and over just cuz there's literally not enough content for the average consumer to to to consume and people have not caught on to a few things. First, you just need to make more content that a consumer will like. Most people don't know how to make viral content. Content that any person can watch, consume, and is digestible. And everyone on on X is trying to go for like be like the most intellectual, like, like thoughtful person and they'll generate some slop that maybe like 200 people in the world can actually understand and make sense of. But of course they they they want they want to seem like the most interesting, thoughtful, like intelligent person, but this just does it lacks viral sense. There's not enough viral content to go out and and the second thing is that the algorithms really promote the the most controversial things and um, people on X seem to have there's not enough controversial things to be rewarded for. So when I come out swinging out of the gate, I've been on Instagram, TikTok for the past 10 years of my life and I understand what sort of what level of controversialness you need. I I I take the slightest foot into controversialness and all of a sudden X LinkedIn explodes because the algorithm inherently highly, highly rewards this stuff and as as a result, it's just getting shoved into everyone's feed and they don't understand. But I'm I'm just like literally applying the same principles of um, controversialness from IG, TikTok onto X LinkedIn and and it's just they're just so not ready for it that feels like uh, the craziest thing ever. And this is something that I've said before, but I guarantee like my videos do not go as viral on Instagram, Instagram, TikTok. And the sole reason is because on those platforms they are not controversial enough. And there on those platforms there are literally people committing felonies in public or at least insinuating like that they're committing felonies. And even then it'll be like, \"Oh, good try, bro,\" like, like, like it's not interesting enough and uh, like, like X, they just have not caught on. There's not enough creators out there who are willing to press the controversial button.\n\nThere was a Mark Mark says this sometimes, right? Like supply chain of the meme. It's like the strangest concept, but the meme actually travels from like Reddit and then it goes to, you know, X and then it goes to Instagram, then LinkedIn, then CNBC, and there's like a train that it goes and, you know, certain people are just really late. But when it when you actually flip it with verality and controversiness, maybe that flips a little bit.\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, and sometimes it starts in like 4chan or something like the most\n\nThat's what I mean. Like I I didn't even want to say it. It's like 4chan, Reddit, then Twitter, then Instagram, and LinkedIn. But for you, it's actually Instagram and Twitter comes before uh, Twitter in terms of the runchiness or craziness of it.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, I just feel like the average person who's in X comments hating about how controversial this is. If if they spent one hour looking through the the timeline that is my Instagram feed, their brains would melt and explode. Like they would not be able to comprehend how are people like digesting this at scale. Well, it's funny because ever since Elon took over X, people, some people start complaining of like, \"Oh, the stuff has gotten too controversial or too much dark stuff or too much, you know, negative content.\" And um, yeah, turns out they're uh, you know, it's just the just the beginning.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, literally, this is this is what the future of content is going to be. You're not going to get more\n\n\nMillennial founders. You're only going to get more Gen Z founders. And I guarantee you, their backgrounds in content are the exact same as mine. And they know exactly what I'm doing. And I'm sort of like the canary that's leading the way for this, but I guarantee you there's more of this coming, and it's inevitable. Just embrace it.\n\nWhen did you realize that this was the way you were going to build a company? That, like, how did you intuit it? Like, hey, distribution is a scarcity. Distribution is what matters. And that, because there's a lot of creators out there, but they're not combining it with a tech company. Like, how did, how, and when did you put this together? I guess there was a certain point where I kept going viral that I sort of realized that I know something that X, LinkedIn people don't know yet, and it is sort of like mastery of the algorithm.\n\nUm, and I think, like, everything started with the interview coder situation. Um, interview coder was the earliest prototype of Cluely, and it was a tool to let you cheat on technical interviews, and I used it to cheat my way through an Amazon interview. I made it super public. I posted it everywhere and ended up getting me, like, blacklisted from big tech and kicked out of school. Um, and that situation was inherently viral. Like, when's the last time someone got kicked out of an Ivy League and raised $5 million? Like, this has probably never happened in the history of humanity. Um, so that situation was inherently viral. And at that time, I had no idea that this was like a repeatable thing that I could do. Um, but then the launch video happened, and I had my intuitions about the virality of launch video, and I just kept scrolling on Twitter, and I was wondering, like, man, why is nobody doing what Avie Schiffman with friend.com showed the world you could do a year ago? Like, why has nobody done this yet? And it worked. And then I did the 50 interns thing, and it worked. And, like, I kept doing viral video after viral video, and at a certain point, it just realized, like, holy, people on X, LinkedIn, they have not caught on yet. And, and, and this is the massive alpha that I'm trying to capture here is that they have not caught on to what it means to master the short-form algorithm or the algorithm that is one of short form. And as a result, they're literally, like, I am able to dominate the timeline for not the past week, but like, probably the past few months, just because people on X, LinkedIn, have not caught on. And for some reason, they still refuse to catch on. Right.\n\nAnd so just to put a point out, the 50 interns maybe explained this idea of basically at your company, you either have, you have engineers, and you have creators.\n\nYeah. There are only two roles. You are either a world-class engineer who's building the product, or you are a world-class influencer. And for a full-time, um, every single person has over 100,000 followers on some social media platform. It is the only way to prove that you actually have mastery over virality and you understand what it takes. And I think if any company in the world has a marketing team and the head of marketing does not have 100,000, at least 100,000 followers, like, you need to replace them. Like, like the game has changed. And so do you think this is a strategy that other companies should also be employing of basically having, whether it's intern-based or just like having an army of creators and sort of deploying them towards their end?\n\nYeah, I'll go a bit deeper into the interns. So, so Cluely made a pretty viral video announcing that we're hiring 50 interns, and you'd be in here making content all day. And, um, essentially, that, that's almost what we do. We have, like, over 60 contractors. These contractors get paid per video, and they just are forced to sit in front of a camera and make TikTok and Instagram videos about Cluely. And this is what marketing looks like. This job does not exist 5 years ago. Like, like, how do you explain the job of you sit in front of a camera and you make five 10-second videos that make seemingly make no sense to anybody, but just consistently generate millions of views? Like, that, that's not a job that makes sense to people. Um, but that, that is our internship. That's what, like, a modern-day marketing internship looks like. Like, we pay very little money for the amount of views that we get. And different companies, like, like, you're, they're paying literally millions of dollars for Super Bowl ads when you can get the same quality and quantity of views for $20,000.\n\nDo you see it converting? Converting?\n\nYes. Yes. Yes. Of, I mean, like, those are realistically our only converting videos is the ones that we have on IG, TikTok.\n\nYeah. Brian, why don't you share your story of how you got excited about Cluely, of how you and Roy met and built this relationship and how this partnership formed?\n\nSounds great. Uh, I had, uh, I had a good contact in New York who's, uh, you know, travels in the young, cracked, uh, folks area, and her name is Ali Dvau, and she sent, um, one of the lists that she sent had Roy in it, and I, like, read what they're working on, and it sort of reminded me of, like, oh, like a scout thing, or it's, you know, it's on the edge of virality. I'm like, oh, this is interesting. I want to talk to him. So I reached out. Roy, if you remember, I just reached out, hey, heard your name, blah, blah, we should talk. You're like, \"Oh, bro, let's talk.\" And then, like, a day later, you, you, you wrote back, and I'm like, \"Actually, you're multi-stage. I don't want to talk to you. Uh, my advisor says, 'Don't want to talk to you. Go away.'\"\n\nAnd then what do I do? Like, I could have just stood down, but I said, \"Okay, fine. I promise you will not talk about fundraising. Let's just talk. Like, I want to meet you. I want to talk to you. I want to build a relationship.\" Blah, blah, blah. Thankfully, you agreed. We got on a quick call. We, like, chatted a little bit where you, like, had your origin story. I'm like, \"Oh my god, this kid's, uh, it's amazing. It's, it's so cool. Like, I'm glad he's doing this. Sadly, he's not accepting money, but that's okay.\" Yeah. And then I tracked you. I tracked your Twitter. I tracked what you're doing. The 50 intern. You moved to San Francisco. And I had it in my mind. Okay. Next time, like, when the opportunity strikes, I'm just going to show up. So, I think I, I somehow got your phone number or some such thing and texted you, yo, like, I'm at your office. Can I, can I hang?\n\nSo, I, I come and, and I, and you say, yeah, like, that's great. Like, come up. And what I actually think was really, really cool, there a couple of steps, but step one was there was like an engineer who randomly found you on Twitter or Instagram and had, had just come up, like, you, you did not know him. He did not know you. He just, like, came to your office, came in to say hi, wanted to say hello. And one of your friends, I think, uh, Nicholas was just there hanging out. And the quality of the people, the fact that random engineers were knocking on the door to come talk to you randomly was just like, \"Oh, like, there's something like really strange and special happening here, and like, all of your team members sitting on the thing and, like, doing things and creating content, and you and Neil working on the product, and like, oh, like, there's something very special.\" And I sort of was thinking, oh, like, is this, is this something that we should, we should sort of back? And then I think, uh, one more video was made or something, and next time I visited, I think I, I came with some, some stuff, or you, you're eating steak, and then you flash some, you know, metric or something where I realize that you're converting this, like, awareness and eyeballs into money dollars. You, like, drop some numbers. You're like, \"Oh yeah, we're doing this many revenue, and that's what we're doing, and guess what? Like, some enterprise customer wants to talk to us. I don't know why, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" And that's when I sort of realized, oh, he is actually, uh, able to, like, convert this awareness and distribution that you're getting into real dollars. And I don't know many people who know how to do that. And during that time, I was already writing this thing called momentum as a mode because it's been so hard to pierce through the noise of everything in AI, especially in the sort of consumer-facing pursuers facing. To do that consistently is actually way, way, way harder, near impossible.\n\nAnd so I had the theory that, oh, like, companies who know how to do that, companies who know how to build at that speed are going to be the winners. And I felt like I have found a person who was doing that. And so, you know, I think we, we, we move very quickly, right? Like, Roy, we, I think we, I told you, look, like, just, just hit download. Hit download on the Stripe data. Hit download, send it to us. I won't ask any more questions. Yeah.\n\nAnd then we'll, we'll have a chat, and that hopefully is what we delivered. We, uh, quickly scrambled to do a very fun for small person interview or small person chat with you and some of the partners, partners where you called some of them old, bald, and boring. Um, and we, we were excited to, you know, do the deal. I think I was at an LP summit running around in Las Vegas trying to call you to get to a terms, etc. And that's how it all worked out. And, uh, after a while, I brought, I brought you five, six pounds of steak as a some excitement and a, and a deal.\n\nI, I want to double down on the double click on the momentum as a mo piece, Brent, because you have an interesting background and that you've been doing consumer for a while. You worked at Snap beforehand, among other places, and I remember Ben Thompson had this post about Snap where he said that Snap has a gingerbread strategy where basically, you know, if they invent stuff, Meta is going to copy it, so they just have to keep inventing stuff, and I guess it's like follow the breadcrumbs or something. And, and you also have backed a number of these, you know, um, consumer, you've had a front-row view to, hey, um, you know, these network effects aren't as necessarily defensible as they once were, and so companies need to keep innovating, keep, keep pushing. And so share more about how this kind of momentum, especially as it moves to AI companies, h, how this theory was born and what, what it really means for for forability.\n\nI did not have that view before. I did not think gingerbread strategy necessarily worked, nor momentum was a moat. I, I did not, I actually truly believed in these handcrafted artisan products that really get to the core of why people want to use it. I still somewhat believe core of it, but like, you know, these, like, artisan products where, you know, it just takes a while to build it, and it's like, very, very nuanced, and I have believed that led to high retention. So the thing that I looked at the most always was, is this product highly retained? Is this product, does it product have, like, network effect on this, the traditional sort of theories of moat? And what I realized, uh, and this was like true to some extent in the era of mobile. Mobile is like a two-decade-old platform. So a lot of things have been tried, and a lot of people tried different things, and therefore finding something that people came back again and again and again was the most important thing in my mind. And then AI hit, and I still had that framework where, oh, like, I'm going to look for things that are highly retentive and repeated again and again, and guess what, things change too fast. Like, the underlying model changes every day or every week. If you, like, craft this thing, and OpenAI as someone, like, built their new, new model to include that part in their new, new product, you're done. You're gone. So then it, it couldn't become about, like, this highly thoughtful, slow-build product. It needed to be something where founders knew how to move extremely quickly, and that included product, that included distribution. And because these things are so magical, like, AI is so magical, we, like, built a digital god, locked it in a, you know, chatbot. Because it's so magical right now, kind of anything goes. Like, people will give it a chance. And therefore, what's really important is to try to build the plane as it's falling down the cliff. And people who enjoy the thrill of the, you know, plane going down and actually is, like, is excited about building as it goes down, I think those are the winners of the next day. And so when I think about, uh, folks like Roy, it's the type of founder archetype who gets value and who's excited and leading the charge in terms of that speed, whether it's marketing, distribution, or product build. And usually all of that needs to come together to build an extremely durable, long-dated product. And that to me eventually will turn into product that need to be retained, that need to be used every day. But we're still in this early stage of AI where I think momentum is the moat. And you know, going back to Roy, like, I love to hear how you think about it, because we talked about a little bit over chat where you think, like, stage one, stage two, stage three of building Cluely and sort of the distribution advantage that you have, and you keep talking about this, oh, maybe X and LinkedIn people don't get it right now, but that gap may, you know, narrow over time. So how do you think about the next stage and etc.? But that's how it links to sort of my theory of momentum of the mo. I, I want to get to Royy's product strategy, but first I want to on some points, which is, you know, it was interesting, Paul Graham, when he started Y Combinator, identified that technical founders were undervalued, that that they were being underappreciated, and people thought, oh, you know, you need to have an MBA or, and he realized, hey, it's easier to teach technical founders business than it is to teach, you know, business people how to build great products or how to code. And then what happens over the next 15 years, it becomes way easier to, to, to build these things, um, sort of, you know, AWS, you know, low code, AI, etc., and distribution becomes the scarcity, and that there's so much, um, you know, so much software, there's so, you know, it's such a flooded ecosystem as you quoted in your piece, Andrew Chen's piece about how the, um, all the marketing channels suck, they've all been sort of, you know, like,\n\n\nrang out dry and so distribution is now the scarcity and so in the same way, you know, the technical co-founder now there's almost like an audience co-founder or almost like a hey how do you how do you really break out and we've seen creators start to build business like Mr. Beast with his, you know, chocolate feastables, right? Um, but you know, Kylie Jenner with her, was it the makeup line?\n Yeah, makeup line.\nYeah. Whatever. These creators that create these like lip lip gloss commerce, you know, whatever. Like, but no one's really done it with software. No one has put the two and two together. You know, Justin Bieber tried to do a um a social network called shots or he tried, you know, John Shahiti via using Bieber. Um, but no big creator has really built um whether a consumer or enterprise huge software company, they've built commerce or physical goods. And I always thought, hey, why doesn't Mr. Beast launched like a Square competitor? Like he's got all these eyeballs. Like he's got I'm sure he's got to get something better margins than than than Fastables. And and he's he has games and and he's a a friend and a friend of the firm and he's done phenomenally well. But what I what I like is that Roy Lee is putting both of those together. And so may maybe you can walk through a little bit. You talked about your distribution strategy. Why don't you talk about how the product strategy has has evolved from from the beginning on and then we get to the the sequencing.\n Yeah. I think um something that a lot of people miss is that uh the first line of Cluely code was written like 10 weeks ago. Um so this is like really new and I this started with interview coder which is just like a product that that I coded up over a weekend in my dorm. Um and it was like a tool to let you cheat on interviews. Um, and what we realized after we got about like 250 million impressions on the whole scenario is like, wow, we just got so many eyeballs on this thing, maybe if we can do this again, but we have a more general use product with a similar UX cuz we think we're really on to something with the UX here, then maybe we can make a lot more money. And um, that's what we did with Cluely and we just launched it as like interview coder for everything, you know, cheat on everything like like like let's just see what happens and the usage data will tell us what people are using it for. That's like exactly what's happening now. we have this general purpose cheating tool uh like cheating tool which is in reality is just like a invisible AI overlay and we let's just here's a here's a new user experience for AI let's push it out to a bunch of people and see see what happens and as a result like now we're past like a billion views overall on Cluely and we're the probably like the most viral startup in the world and we have all this usage data that literally tells us hey here's where this is most sticky and here's where the product direction needs to go and I think that's like the core advantage of distribution is like you do not have to worry about market fit or anything because your users will tell you where the direction of market fit is headed and their usage data will literally give you the information that you need to know and if you don't have usage data then you're literally shooting blind like every every person who has built a company before knows that you can't really know what direction you're going you have to talk to your users but I feel like you don't like if your distribution is strong enough you don't need to like talk to your users you just need to look at their data like you just need to look look at the aggregate number.\n When you're also redefining kind of what a minimum val product is to some degree like people have to spend you know, other people, other companies will spend many months building this thing and then seeing how people use it. But for you, if you can create, you know, sort of draft the right content, you can test out the idea in a much quicker way to see, hey, is this really resonating?\n Yeah, exactly. I mean, we didn't even have like when we launched the video, like we barely had a functioning product. Like we the day before is when we finished our final test and we're like, \"Okay, we think this works now. Let's just launch the video as soon as possible.\" and we launched a video and like all of a sudden tens of thousands. We just said, \"Hey, let's just throw sales calls in the videos to see if people use it for sales calls because that seems like a pretty lucrative space. All of a sudden, we have like over a million dollars of enterprise revenue coming in from people using it for sales calls.\" And it's just uh like you can shot in the dark distribution a lot quicker and a lot more accurately than you could shot in the dark um product. And you don't need like a million product integrations like like it's just so much quicker. And what's even better about it is that the the iteration loop is much faster too because the algorithm will literally tell you via a number which is number of views, likes, shares, whatever, like how well your your strategy is going to work. So it's like it's it's much much easier to test is this viral, does this have viral fit rather than does this have like you know market fit.\n And maybe Roy, does that mean you you sort of let the uh audience guide where the product goes? Is that how you sort of think about?\n Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And maybe tell let's talk talk a little bit about like the form factor because one of the things that internally we discussed is look Roy Roy's probably top 1% now I revised it to top 0.1% in the world in terms of knowing how to distribute that married the ven diagram of that and people who know and had the instinct to build a semi-transucent um over overlay.\n It sounds so simple.\n Yeah. So does this this disappearing picture sounds so simple? It's easy. It's not technically hard.\n Like h half translucent overlay that sounds simple. It's not technically hard.\n Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n But that overlap to me was what gave me so much excitement around what you're building. I actually have it right now on like Eric, did you go to University of Michigan?\n Yeah, I did.\n I see. I didn't know that. I I did not know that. But I I have Cluely open. I'm like you went to U of M. Did got that? Oh, you did philosophy, policy, and economics. I think like great, we can we can sort of bond over that, you know, like this all of a sudden is an incredible tool.\n Yeah, that's amazing. Well, why don't you talk more about where you see the product going or particularly like how you think about it? Anyone who's building AI tool is like asking themselves the question of how does, you know, one of the incumbents not how's this defensible from one of the the ma the major players, you know, OpenAI, etc. just just build this feature. H how do you think about making your product like a truly defensible especially from the people that how because of their reach their size you know OpenAI has distribution too right so how do how do you think about this?\n Yeah I mean I I guess we're first to move in a pretty novel UX and I think like we did get to translucent like I think everyone's going to inevitably get to translucent overlay this is how an integrated AI should feel and like Apple shows everyone that like like liquid glass is the translucent overlay that that that that will be the form factor of AI in the future right now I feel like it's just a land grab and um if the question is about distribution then I think there's actually like a pretty strong case for us to make that we will actually end up distributing better than OpenAI and um it's enough that you could probably bet on us at like what like a 30,000x discount um and and and I I I'm actually not not worried about distribution and I think the quant the quality of the product I mean it's it's quite simple um I I really feel like this is just a land grab right now to see who can convince as many consumers and enterprise first that they are the guy who deserves to win the translucent overlay. And right now we're making so much noise. I mean like with the translucent overlay like like why would it not be us?\n And when did you figure out the translucent over overlay was the was the right?\n Yeah. I mean I was just in my dorm with Neil and we were just like we literally spent every day thinking about how can you make interview coder more invisible to interviews and and and we we we played around and there's probably like 20 to 30 versions of interview coder in the past that just we thought didn't work. But you know, you you you essentially it feeds you a code answer like like an answer to a coding problem and you need to overlay that on top of your code. And we're just like, man, I really need this integrated into my code. I need to see what I'm doing as well as see the answer that AI is giving me. And eventually we just landed on translucency. And this was like, wow, this is like a magical moment. This is what the product needed. And like very soon we realized like why are we only thinking about coding interviews and like software engineering coding interviews? this is such a small market like like th this this is true for everything. AI should not feel like a separate window like it should be integrated seamlessly and and that that that that looks like translucency.\n I would love Roy to chat about the staged approach of how you're thinking about it. I think like right now we're distribution first and then we'll sort of build the product as we go. Stage two, here's how we do it with like bunch of engineering prowess and product development etc. I think uh we sort of chatted a little bit about that on on text and to me that was like oh okay like he's he's got like you you'll figure out like a product as you go. So I'd love to love to talk a little bit about that.\n I mean right now the internet is up in storm saying hey where's the product? Where's the product? And um that the the two things that like we are literally working day and night to like build out the product that we have in our head that the users are telling us that that they want. Um, but also like every video I make that's not directly about the product drums up so much more hype for the eventual product launch video. Like I will guarantee that this will be viral. Um, and I guarantee that it will be more viral than if we just launched like earlier. And I think there's like there's truth in the statement of like launch early, ship fast, launch before you're ready. But for some reason when we're doing that at scale like it feels like like everyone is like oh no, you launched too early. Like now now where's the problem? Like what what are you talking about? This is the playbook. Like we wrote our first lines of code 10 weeks ago. We're like earlier than the latest YC batch of companies, yet we're like generating probably more revenue than every single one of them. And like like the product is like it's literally two and a half months since since being built. Like like we're in in in my perspective, we are pre-launch. And the the the huge benefit of being like massively distributing pre-launch is that you will know what product to build um with as much certainty as you could possibly get. And if you can distribute and hype it up to an audience of literally millions of people like, \"Hey, this product's coming out. This product's coming out.\" And we're screaming to the world AI overlay, like AI that sees your screen. Here's here's your audio. Like the second we make that, like why would you pick anyone else's product to use? We've been screaming from the top of our lungs since day one. Like before day one even. Um, and like right now this the stage is distribution. Get it into everyone's mind. Like what is Cluely? Cluely is the AI, the invisible AI that sees your screen and hears your audio. Like everyone knows this. Um, and as soon as we launch it, like who else will will they download?\n Yeah. And one thing I think that's fascinating about what you're doing, and I'll compare it to our friends at TBPN who are kind of rebranding or reclaiming, they call themselves corporate driven media. And because everyone was like, \"We're independent media.\" And they're like, \"No, no, we're corporatebacked. We're more honest that way.\" Like, um, and they're just leaning into uh, you know, like all the bits about ramp and, you know, you save 5% and it there's this kind of humor to it. And I think similarly like you're kind of leaning into controversy or being controversial as a strategy where some people think, oh that's like fake or forced or whatever, but you're at the same time you're super authentic in in the way that you're doing it and people feel like they they know you and and sometimes even there if there's a character and exaggeration that also feels authentic in in some way. It's um it just kind of a unique unique style.\n Yeah. I mean I think this like just reflects a growing like like a shift in society. I mean, literally for the past few decades now, there's just been such this sharp drop off drop off in professionalism. And I really think it's because like content creation has been democratized like like the first ever YouTube creators were just people making funny videos in their dorms. And this was the most authent like people crave this. They they they nobody wants to see another ad or another corporate newspaper like like that. Like they want to see some real person doing real things. And um the democratization of content creation has allowed authentic people who make content to be seen by millions. And now authentic people who create content will be seen by millions. And um for some reason it's just like no company gets this. You'll have like a 100x followers and your post will be about introducing blah blah blah blah blah. And it's it's like the most corporate ever. Like you're not going to get any views and nobody wants to see this. Like would you rather have a world where everyone was extremely transparent and even the founders were honest and like like everything you see is just someone's authentic life or would you rather see like bunch of corporate everywhere? Like what we envision for the endstate distribution of Cluely is that it does not feel like an ad at all. this is just the story of someone's life that you want to see. Um, and it is like true and authentic. And I I I try to be like I'm probably more transparent about everything than\n\n\nI'd say probably 99% of companies in the valley are.\n\nWell, it's funny because what you're saying, some people get so mad at the some. I heard someone call it RZ marketing, which is a compliment, but they're like, \"I hate this RZ marketing.\" Like it's got to be, you know, product first. Get back to fundamentals. But first, this is its own fundamentals too of how the world works today. But two, it's like, you know, so of course they can't destroy you. But even the people who want to destroy you, the joke in my head is they can try to kill you, but they can't kill the idea.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, like the way that you're building companies, like there's something about it that is going to have an impact on the next generation. And it's uh, you know, you're just starting the company journey. But even still, just like causing that shift or inspiring that shift is is is just remarkable.\n\nWhat what I would say the viral marketing, when you say viral marketing, is interesting, right? Like one leads to another. I actually think what you're doing is like anti-fragile marketing. Yeah, like you're so controversial. I'm going to cut off your head. And three sprungs up because one is mad at you, one is really happy about you, one is neutral. Like you get all these, like every time someone comes at you and comes at the idea of Cluely, the more aura aura points it gets, like aura farming.\n\nAny lessons from the most controversial stuff that you've you've done, or is it is it always triple down? Is it like how do you think about, is there a line? Where do you cross it?\n\nYeah.\n\nI think the the few lessons have been never punch down, like never ever even remotely close to punch down. Um, and I think people reward and the algorithm does, like, reward authenticity more than anything. Like it rewards many things, but but but one of the things that it rewards most is is like authenticity. And I think you'll see me in Twitter, like every once in a while I'll make like a genuine comment like, \"Hey, hey, thank you. Like I really respect you or something.\" I think like, like people love to see that. Um,\n\nyeah, I saw your response to Gary Tan.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, it's true. Yeah. Like I I respect that guy and and I I hope that that one day when the company gets to where I imagine it will be, then then he will he will come turn around. I don't think the lesson is to triple down on everything. The I think the lesson is to like, if if you're honest, then the algorithm will reward you because there's literally zero other company out there that is being fully honest about everything and there's zero founder out there that um behaves authentically. The only other person I might think is like Elon Musk. And I think that's like a really good role model to have in business making.\n\nYeah.\n\nAs you build Cluely into the first destination for consumers and enterprise alike, how do how does like the type of stunts, if you will, and skits actually fit into the type of customer that you want to serve? Like 40 years ago, we were way more professional than we are now. You, if you are even an engineer, you come into work, you come in with a suit and tie, and if you don't, it's distasteful. It's disgusting. I cannot believe it. Like, like you should never ever show up in a hoodie and sweatpants. Now, you're weird if you come up with a suit and you're not in a hoodie and sweatpants. And there's just like everyone wants more authentic things. Right now, there's this for some reason in society, there's we're still lingering onto this image that companies need to be like brand friendly and boring and never say anything controversial or whatever the like, like, like I don't understand how this became the societal norm. But in reality, people want to see interesting things. I mean, like that's the point of life is you see interesting things and it's like there there's just this lack of professionalism. And again, with the distribution of short form content, like everyone sees the craziest things and you just get desensitized to these things. And that's why sports like sperm racing are able to be so hyperviral. Like nobody would have aired this on CNN 10 years ago, but you don't need CNN anymore. You have Instagram, Tik Tok, and Instagram, Tik Tok, they love sperm racing. As a result, they're able to raise a massive valuation, like genuinely have a shot at being like the next legit sport. And um it's not just sperm racing. I mean it's every company in the world. There's Sam Altman talking about how hot the guys are that GPT generates in the timeline. There's Elon Musk doing ravings about his political takes. Like every company is getting less and less controversial. This trend is more more and more controversial. Sorry. More and more controversial.\n\nYeah. Less professional. This trend is not dying anytime soon. I'm just the person that is pushing the envelope perhaps a little a little further than the world is ready for at the moment. I think the the question that everyone should linger on a little bit is like um what happens? Can you imagine a world where we do win? Like can you imagine the world, like what will the state of the world look like if Cluely does win and we prove to everyone like the bar for professionalism is here, where we've determined it, the entire state of like the corporate culture of America as a whole is going to shift and perhaps the entire world, um everyone will realize like, oh, we've been we've had our like, like, like panties up in a bunch worrying about brand image and professionalism when in reality the world craves something different and I have very strong conviction that I'm right in because I was right about X. And I I just I did not understand for the life of me why nobody is producing the viral videos that were so obviously designed to go viral for the algorithm. It's just because nobody has caught on and nobody's willing to like press that button. Um now that I've pressed the button once, I I like just imagine what the world looks like if Cluely makes it. And then I I you probably you probably like are more interested in that. That that would be a much more interesting world if every company was being 100% radically transparent and doing exactly what what the most interesting thing was.\n\nAs Elon says, the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. So true.\n\nOn uh on that note, this is the been a fantastic episode with Roy Lee and Bryan Kim. Guys, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Thank you so much for having Thank you.\n",
