  "cleanText": "The energy grid and electrical grid of the future. It's not just going to be the dichotomy of generation, transmission, and storage. This sort of next generation of what the grid looks like is going to be in a much more decentralized way. Why are delivery costs such a big problem? The grid is aging now and brittle. The workforce is aged out. Should we just leapfrog the grid? Like, I need this power now. Today, we have this insatiable thirst for energy. How do you get software almost insidiously on the grid? The United States needs to get better at mega projects. Things that are billion dollars, things that are at scale. There is no safety. There is no national defense. There is no national security without a reliable electrical grid.\n\nU.S. energy peaked in 1973 in terms of per capita usage. China's has increased ninefold over that same time period. We have some reasons to be optimistic now that things will start to change or it will change further. Why don't you give some context there? What's happened and why should we be excited about what's coming for? Maybe Ryan, why don't you start with you?\n\nYeah, I mean the history of the grid in the United States was build big power plant industry formed around it. The grid grew sort of incredibly fast through the 20th century. Then around the 80s and 90s things started slowing down. And then through sort of the early 2000s the grid effectively froze in the United States. A big piece of that was a lot of the energy generation, a lot of the manufacturing, a lot of the heavy industry moved to Asia. And so for the last like 20 years, effectively the grid has sort of ossified. We forgot how to build new power plants. We forgot how to build new power projects, new loads, sort of large data centers, large factories, large mega projects.\n\nAnd you say we forgot, were we not allowed to or we actually just lost the...\n\nWe were allowed to, but we lost the skill set. And I think you can kind of see it in more extreme examples with nuclear power plants. Although that transition happened decades before, but basically the grid itself, the grid operators forgot sort of how to, you know, plan, how to move quickly, how to do it cheaply. And so, you know, now we're at this point in time where we are restoring, we are bringing back manufacturing, we are bringing back, you know, data centers, and there's sort of this highly concentrated demand, and it's sort of now, now, now at sort of any price, but like they cannot move fast enough, and sort of so that's what we're seeing today. We talk about sort of data centers and the grid being sort of inflexible to this. It's sort of playing catch-up. We need to do a lot of the growth that happened in China and sort of bring this here and do it incredibly fast.\n\nHow did this forgetting happen? And I asked to then ask a question of how can this relearning happen or this the learning happen or kind of retraining happen.\n\nIt's a good question. I think a lot of it's like a workforce issue. I think a lot of it's a policy issue. I think the United States, you know, started historically with a bunch of regulated utilities sort of as a top-down big thermal power plant, big transmission lines connecting to substations, then distribution lines going to individual factories, homes, things like that. And I think some of the newer technologies don't necessarily benefit from scale in the same ways that these large thermal plants typically did. And so, you know, this sort of next generation of what the grid looks like is going to be in a much more decentralized way. So there's also an element of sort of relearning of what is the grid actually is. Is the grid these large sort of power systems and large infrastructure projects, or does it look like a lot more decentralized way where we can eliminate a lot of the wires in between things like delivery costs, which have increased exponentially? And can we do it in a more dynamic and flexible way? So things like solar and batteries, they don't need to be massive. You can kind of put them anywhere. You can put them next to load. And so this is also sort of an element that like grid operators are thinking through. How do we do that while also managing frequency, voltage, things like that without, you know, causing sort of a grid to go down. So there's a lot of challenges.\n\nWell, if you think about what our grid is, I mean it's a piece of technology that was designed about a hundred years ago, and very little technology on the grid has changed in those hundred years. And you know, you look at why are delivery costs such a big problem? You know, grid is at capacity. Getting a new project onto the grid today, you know, you sign up for interconnection, it could take a decade. There's a backlog of 20 plus years to get a new transformer. The transformer technology we're using today, it's kind of bananas. Like if you actually look at what makes a transformer, first of all, there's like one company that makes these, and there's like one plant in the U.S. that produces the right type of steel that you need in order to make these transformers, and it's a hundred-year-old tech. And it's like the weight list for transformers is insane. We're getting to the point in demand starting to rise again and the calcification of grid technology where it's like should we just leapfrog the grid? Like, do we really need to wait in line and you know, wait for this to catch up? I think there's like two versions of how you do that. One is, you know, how do you get power gen and power storage essentially as close to demand as possible? And that's a problem for new tech to really help solve because we're talking about instead of these like mega projects that we're used to building, like well not used to building anymore, like massive nuclear plants, massive new natural gas plants, etc. We're talking about much smaller, and more distributed sources of power, bypassing interconnection altogether. In many cases, we're seeing that as a pretty big trend with data centers. As data centers are just building power directly on site and collocating power with the data center. Microsoft's like, I can't afford to wait 10 years to get an interconnection with the grid. Like, I need this power now today. So, how do you get, you know, how do you get power more tightly coupled with the load that it's actually going to serve? And that that's a really interesting problem for tech also from a software perspective because, you know, if you get generation, storage, and usage all collocated very closely together, like that's a very good problem for AI to solve, like reinforcement learning. Stick that in there and suddenly you get massively efficient systems that you, you know, you couldn't get at grid scale.\n\nYeah, I think an interesting point to add on to that is that there's very little visibility into the grid itself. So like they understand sort of power plants are operating or not, but especially at sort of the distribution level, the things like power lines you might see outside your home, there's very little understanding of what's actually going on there. And so there's like a reluctance, especially when you have things like net metering where I'm sending from my home a battery back to the grid, things get incredibly complicated, and so the grid operators don't have a very good understanding of like when can they allow new projects to go online, how much power, when to actually, you know, cut people off. And so there's a lot of these policies. Interconnection is sort of the general term, but like states like Texas have like a much more lenient policy of like you can build wherever you want. But, you know, if we need to cut it off from the grid, we're going to do so. And so it's sort of this connect and manage approach. Whereas other states, like they will do these incredibly long feasibility studies in like a variety of scenarios. The entire grid is at peak capacity, but they want to make sure this specific project can stay online, you know, 24/7. So that ends up creating these massive delays. So there's a lot of policy approaches here as well. And there's a bunch of these technologies called grid enhancing technologies, which are effectively like, you know, an average power line might be used at like 50% capacity, but it needs to be designed for the peak capacity for, you know, the summer when everyone has their AC on. And so there's a lot of, you know, sensors or other technology that could be placed there so you have a much more dynamic view of what our infrastructure actually is looking like. And so when we have these new technologies, then we can much more efficiently use the infrastructure we have.\n\nDo you, what are your reactions to this conversation thus far? Is that so where are some areas you're particularly excited about or reasons to be optimistic?\n\nWell, I think the reason we're having this conversation is we're sort of touching on a bunch of these topical themes, which is that we're at a moment in time where exactly like Ryan said, the grid is aging now and brittle. The workforce is aged out. I mean, we'll talk about that more, I think, in a minute, but you know, we had to go out and train, hire, and train entire specialized crews, specialized people that work with cement and concrete, specialized people that work with steel to go build the large Vogtle reactors in Georgia. We put them on Vogtle reactors 3 and four. We turned them on, huge win. And then those people like went back to like building highways or like bridges or something else, and like instead of just going and putting them on Vogtle like five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 and building just like this massive crescendo of nuclear power, we just like put these people back into the general workforce. And so we just we are not learning our lesson there on the workforce. And at the same time we have this insatiable thirst for energy, whether it's EVs, whether it's data center compute for AI, or just generally a shift toward more and more consumption of electricity, or even just like the restoring and manufacturing and all these things that are just very, very electron heavy. I think at the same time, a piece that we hardly ever talk about, which is sort of resiliency and not having people be as dependent on the interconnectedness of the grid. I mean people that you deploy solar, you know, we talk about like distributed compute for those of us that are in the tech world and like how important it is to like have distributed compute and have networks be able to suffer and survive through segmentation and things. But like the grid is very interdependent. Even in the U.S., there's really only a few major regions that that can segment themselves off. But when you deploy solar or you deploy batteries or you deploy an SMR reactor or your own battery, you know, your own power generation on site for your own data center, you don't have to worry about how brittle the grid is because you're you're fairly resilient from it. And I think that's a component is that the energy grid and electrical grid of the future, it's not just going to be the dichotomy of generation, transmission, and storage. But as Aaron brought up, like you might do all three of those things in the same place and not have to worry about how robust the grid is or how capable the grid operators are. And I think that's a dimension that was never important to people before, but it's important today. And you can certainly imagine if you're the military, you certainly care about having reliable access to power at all your forward operating bases and and even at home at your home military bases, like you just you cannot lose your ability to have electricity. And so I think all these things are just coming together at once, and it's a really exciting moment in time, and I think it's buoyed by the fact that we're also at this sort of technology inflection point where AI can help some of these things, not just be a consumption driver, but even be an enabler in facilitating more efficient use of electricity, better monitoring of the grid, better ways to even go through the regulatory and permitting process, which is onerous for many cases.\n\nSo yeah, I think building on that, I think I mean Texas has famously historically had massive grid failures several years ago when, you know, big heat wave came through, the grid couldn't keep up with all the air conditioners that were going on, and people saw massive power outages. Everyone was really mad. People were like, oh, it doesn't work. Dereg doesn't work. And what has Texas done in the couple of years since that happened? They have absolutely flooded the grid with solar capacity. Texas has doubled their solar capacity in the last approximately three years, and with that, they've just deployed thousands of batteries. I mean, one of our portfolio companies, Base Power, is one of the players here, but there's many battery power companies deploying all across Texas to provide storage for that solar power. And if you look at the performance of the Texas grid versus the performance of the New York and surrounding area grid during this extreme heat wave, you know, I must have seen 10 news articles this morning about how well Texas grid has done there. The elasticity and ability to react to the changes, to very quick changes in demand without having to change kind of base load power. Like you can't build a new natural gas plant or a new nuclear reactor overnight, but you know, solar is just so insanely cheap. Like it's basically having a giant massive huge nuclear reactor in the sky that will go forever. And you know, Texas isn't a green state. This isn't, you know, this isn't a political issue, but it's like why aren't we deploying the world's cheapest form of power literally everywhere we possibly can and then just putting batteries everywhere? Like there just should be batteries everywhere. It's kind of bananas to me that batteries as a topic has like recently gotten caught in the sort of political crosshairs. Like we've really just as a society need to be good at power storage and batteries. Like this this shouldn't be a controversial topic. We invented the lithium ion battery. And yet today, you know, if you want to buy a battery, whether it's for a drone or for the grid or for your car or for whatever it is, like you're either buying a battery made in a lights out factory in China or you're buying a battery produced in Vietnam by a Chinese company. And like there's no meaningful effort in the U.S.\n\n\nTo change that.\nThis is a really critical problem, not just to manage power load on the grid, but for power for all of the things that we need to power the, you know, the next generation of innovation in the United States.\nI think we'd be hard-pressed on the American Dynamism team to think of a company that we've met with an interesting technology in the last two years that doesn't have a battery in it somewhere.\nSo as a country, we need to be investing in battery technology and battery manufacturing.\nBy the way, if China decides that whatever your company is doing that's using batteries doesn't align with what they like or they want to punish you, being cut off from being able to buy batteries from China is incredibly punitive to a company.\nAnd we've certainly seen that happen with some of our startups.\nAnd then they have to go, you know, then you find out quickly that the ability to procure and source batteries from places that are not in China is very, very difficult.\nIf you extrapolate that out to what would happen to our whole country if we just were unable to buy batteries from China, it could be catastrophic in a very, very, very short period of time.\nJust add on to a quick point on the grid side of batteries.\nIf the rest of the country, which is presumably watching what's going on in Texas, which is the good operator in Texas, if Texas can prove that you can deploy these sort of decentralized, distributed energy resources and to sort of flatten these peaks, provide more resiliency and and ultimately lower the price of electricity, then every state should go and do this.\nThere's a very complex web of deregulated and regulated entities when it comes to the grid, of course.\nThere are a lot of different policy and workforce and sort of political reasons why, you know, not everywhere is sort of this decentralized world.\nIt'll probably be more complex than just these deregulated energy-only markets that Texas works with.\nI think the United States needs to move incredibly fast to make this happen and hook up batteries, solar panels, and make it easier and cheaper to do it.\nEven collocation for large loads is still a very politically fraught issue.\nUtilities are pushing against this.\nIt's still really hard to hook up solar and batteries to your home.\nI think it's actually cheaper to put residential solar on your home in Germany than in the United States.\nThat's largely a permitting, largely sort of an installation issue.\nThat's crazy.\nThat should not be the case.\nErin, I believe the quote in your college yearbook was \"drill, baby, drill.\"\nSo, how do you think about your sort of love for oil and gas with other sources of energy?\nOh, my parents will be shaking their heads if they hear this.\nI mean, like, okay.\nI think broadly speaking, our approach to energy in the U.S. just needs to be \"yes, and.\"\nI mean, you look at the fact that you know, you look at the sort of atrophy of our power buildout over the last 30, 50, whatever, you know, you name your time frame, years, compared to, let's say, China.\nIf we want to accomplish the goals that we've set out as a society to accomplish over the next decade, like we need more power, and it's just a matter, it's a matter of \"yes, and.\"\nI think, you know, solar and batteries are extremely important, but there is a place for oil and gas.\nI cut my teeth at Palantir working in oil and gas.\nMy husband worked in oil and gas.\nThe first check I wrote at a16z isn't an oil and gas company.\nSo this isn't me coming with a particular agenda around carbon.\nThis is me coming and realizing that we basically need every tool in our toolkit, and we should be using technology to deploy whatever makes most sense wherever it makes most sense at scale.\nIf we're talking about the energy mix of where we're at today and where do we think we're headed, if I were to make like a personal bet, it's like solar batteries are just the co-ability to be incredibly cheap and deploy incredibly fast.\nSpin up and spin down.\nYeah, and I think that that's just going to sort of, is already a way, but I think that will continue.\nBut I think to be very clear is that you need all different types of energy.\nYou're going to need true sort of base load dispatchable power.\nIt's going to be gas, it's going to be nuclear here, it's going to be geothermal.\nThere's going to be a lot of hydro as well.\nAs you attach more of these renewable resources or sort of these non-reliable resources, while incredibly cheap and works most of the time, sort of this longtail risk, you know, once you get to like 50% to 75% of the grid, is going to become very, very expensive.\nYou need a lot more battery backup, things like that.\nSo I think it's going to be very complex, and it's going to be different for many different regions, but certainly it's not all of any given resource.\nYeah.\nYeah, I mean, when you look at the changing nature of load over the next decade, some of that is going to come from data centers, some fraction.\nIt's not, you know, I would say it's probably overstated how much data centers contribute to the growing load in the United States over the next decade.\nData centers generally are base load.\nIf you're training a model, you're largely using kind of a dedicated amount of power for the long term.\nMaybe there's some fluctuations if you're doing more inference, but I would generally say like data centers represent base load, but then you also have things like electric vehicles.\nYou have things like heat pumps and air conditioners.\nYou have industrial autonomy, which may or may not be sort of running 24/7.\nSo you're going to have some increase in the base level of power we as a society need, but continuing to increase the size of the peaks and troughs of how we use energy on a day-to-day basis.\nWe should be thinking about designing our grid and designing our energy mix and power sources around what those loads look like and not oversolving for either base load or variable power.\nI think just to put this in more tangible terms, the sort of the peak summer load in places like California might be half of what it is in winter or something like that.\nIt depends on what climate you're in.\nSo the concept of base load is, do you build all the plants you'd need for, you know, like the 100 gigawatts of power you're going to need when it's wintertime, or in the summer, you know, half the year, you're only going to need 50?\nSo what would be base load?\nSo what you need to do in sort of modern civilization is every time you turn on the switch, the power is working.\nHow you actually match supply with that very, very fluctuating load, both daily and seasonally, is very complex.\nToday you might have to build a natural gas, what's called like a peaker plant, that might only operate like a week a year.\nThat's an incredibly expensive asset that is going to only be delivering very expensive power, but is only needed when all the other resources are tapped, and it's like that last couple megawatts of power.\nThe alternative now you could do is what's called like sort of demand response or with batteries on the grid is say, okay, well, instead of, you know, doing this $10,000 sort of a megawatt-hour plant, I can just make it so everyone's thermostat in this area turns down a couple degrees, and so that then aggregate means that I don't need to build that large asset or pay that expensive premium.\nThere's a lot of things like that that are.\nI do think, though, okay, pushing back on that, like, I think that the American consumer will fully reject that level of dictation over how they use their thermostat.\nI think a more likely outcome is that you can do it on the compute side and just say, look, these three racks of the data center are just going to go offline during the peak summer heat when you're running your AC.\nThis is not a critical job, right?\nIt's a non-critical job.\nIt's not a mission job.\nIt's a back office job, you know, and you're just going to run it at night instead of during the day, and you're going to pay less electricity for that benefit.\nSo I do think that as we build out, I don't know if I agree with Erin that AI is not going to suck up all the compute.\nI mean, I think that Constellation just turned up a new nuclear reactor or is reactivating a reactor, and I think Meta immediately sucked up all of the power that they're going to generate, or 9/10 of it or something, from the new Constellation reactor that they're going to, that Meta signed the contract extension for.\nSo I do think that compute is going to just, I think we actually probably are underestimating the amount of compute that we're going to soak up with electricity over the next, you know, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years, the amount of data we're going to start storing.\nI mean, the amount of video we create per minute has just ballooned way beyond anyone's expectations.\nI'm sure the same will be true for AI compute.\nI think once you start getting into robotics and autonomy, if you think about compute expansively, I totally agree.\nYeah.\nBut so like, but those things are going to be much more responsive than, like, do I want to go have my room be, you know, 74Â° instead of 71Â°?\nWell, let me tell you, anyone that's done business in Tokyo in the summer knows they, as a nation, by the way, Japan has done this.\nIt is absolutely terrible.\nIt's horrible.\nWe're not going to do that in America.\nPlease do not do that in America.\nLike, you know, you're in like the 40th floor of a Japanese building wearing a suit, by the way, because you have to wear a suit, and it's swelteringly hot.\nEveryone is walking around like they're not miserable, but they are miserable, and you want to jump out a window, but the window won't open, and so like it is just, it is one of the worst, like being.\nWhy doesn't France work in the summer?\nThis is why.\nIt's terrible.\nSo, uh, exactly.\nSo, we hate this idea.\nI'm spoiled living in California.\nI will say, I will say, like, the one of the biggest proponents of this or or current users is like crypto mining.\nIt's like these are flexible.\nThese are like, right, but demand responsive, right?\nSo those will just turn off, they'll just turn off their compute when it's cost effective.\nBut that's, it's important, it's important for the grid is like you can build these assets and you have the demand for power here, like they're going to soak up that demand, but if it gets far too expensive, they will also shed that demand.\nBut I think, but in the U.S., my guess is that this is going to, I mean, this already is reflected in the fact that you have peak peak load pricing.\nLike for me, my power is 10x more expensive between the hours of 4:00 and 9:00 p.m.\nSo we don't run the washing machine.\nYou know, I leave it to organizations or individuals to figure out how to manage that, but just like charge people for more power.\nIt's a little, it's a little bit of a nonsequitur, but I like that we keep talking about, you know, oil and gas, we're talking about natural gas, we're talking about batteries, we're talking about solar, we're talking about nuclear.\nWe talked about Ryan even mentioned hydro, which of course is totally viable in some places.\nThe thing that nobody ever brings up anymore, except for, I think, a very fringe group, is wind power.\nI'm very happy to hear that nobody here is stumping for wind.\nI think wind is incredibly cheap when it's working.\nIt's just you don't know if, like, you kind of know solar is going to work and like sort of this reliable schedule.\nYou know, the sun's going to be out.\nIt's going to be working.\nSpare, you know, some cloudy days, but there's still always something coming through.\nBut it might not blow.\nThe wind might not blow for a week.\nI think I think it's worse than that.\nI think I read that globally one-third of all wind turbines are out of service at any given time.\nThe other thing is I think wind is the only power generation mechanism where when you get too much of the input, it actually, like the blades of a wind turbine feather and turn off.\nWhereas like if you get, there's no such thing as too much sun for solar, you stop.\nYeah.\nJust you max out.\nToo much water and hydro, like that's not a problem.\nBut like too much wind and the wind generator turns off.\nIt's just like who wants a system where you get more, more of the input you want, and then it just, and then it stops working?\nIt's also just extremely hard and dangerous and specific to service.\nIt's like you see those videos of people climbing the ladder up to the top of the wind turbine.\nYeah.\nIt's like.\nYeah.\nGrid offers, like, look at they look at wind.\nIt's like great when it's working, but they can't plan for it.\nThey have to build other capacity to supersede that if it's not going to be there when they need it.\nSo fine.\nI see wind.\nWe can move, we can move past wind.\nYeah, I agree.\nSo no wind.\nBut I do, I do think the demand response, like this went to the point that Ryan brought up that monitoring the grid is really important and being able to send signaling on the grid is really important.\nYou have to remember, like, you know, we're all used to the internet, which has, you know, like bidirectional communication and messaging and has, you know, data layer and control layers, and there's like a full control plane and things like that for the internet.\nThe electrical grid doesn't really have that, and so to be able to send messaging and things is very, very difficult.\nNow a lot of people just do it out of band using the internet to actually send messaging and do monitoring of the grid itself without an overlay network is very hard.\nThat's one of the challenges that people are now, I think, starting to address.\nYeah, it's kind of, I mean, it's, it's wild how much of a mystery what's happening on the grid is at any given time.\nLike we really have very little vis.\n\n\nI think it's very hard for, I think, centralized utilities to deploy meaningful software to understand that.\nSo, when you know, when we think about as VCs, like what types of things do we look at and what do we get excited about?\nI think companies that kind of are going at this monitoring from the opposite direction, like how do you get software almost insidiously on the grid?\nLike, how do you start learning more about demand, um, demand and generation as close to the source as possible, and then try to feed that information back from each other?\nLike the idea that you're going to go sell a software tool to a PG&E or similar and have like a reasonably speedy top-down implementation where you actually get good signal and metrics and can actually do interesting things with that data, to me, I find a little bit unbelievable.\nSo, something very interesting that I learned is a lot of the load forecasting, which is basically like the tasking of when plants need to go online.\nAnd so, like there's usually a 24-hour ahead sort of market, day-ahead market that'll basically say you need to run your plan at this time, and then this sort of supply and demand match to a price, and there's like a merit order, and it's complex, but that's sort of how it's done.\nUm, but, like most of this load forecast is done by just looking at the weather.\nLike they look at, like, basically, like one of the best indexes, look at where the homes are, like what, how many people are there, and then what the temperature is going to be, and sort of that often is sort of the largest factor that goes into this modeling.\nBut now, if we have all these sort of connected resources, if we have solar, we have like EV chargers, all of this stuff is spinning off data, telemetry, and things like that, we're going to get a much better look of how load is actually being forecasted, which is going to real time, which is going to be help a lot of understanding, like, you know, where do we actually need to build, like, what is the actual price of power, and then you can start making these markets, I think, a lot more efficient.\nWell, when you look at energy desks, like, uh, for, you know, the big hedge funds or energy, energy trading companies, their weather guy is usually the highest-paid person on the desk beside the portfolio manager.\nLike those climate and weather PhDs that are working out in trading desk, they are just absolutely raking it in, uh, because they're kind of like God right now because there's very little other data.\nThat's why you see when the stuff that goes on in Texas, like heat waves and things like that.\nIf they even get it wrong by a couple of degrees, where it's like, it's either, you know, it's like they think it's going to be sort of hot, but it gets actually really hot, that's when you get these crises, like crises that end up causing a lot of strain on the grid, and then you have to turn on the all these very expensive plants, and then, you know, you get the headlines that are usually also the ones that are worse for the environment as well.\nYep.\nDo you let us know if you have any reactions to this or otherwise give us the state of nuclear?\nWhere are we right now?\nWhat are the major bottlenecks?\nWhat are we excited about?\nThe biggest thing that's shifted in the last two or three or three or four years in nuclear is that, um, everybody now acknowledges that nuclear energy is clean energy.\nUm, I think that's been one, a major shift in public sentiment and perception.\nUm, nonetheless, there's still major headwinds politically with nuclear that need to be overcome.\nUm, Taiwan, for instance, turned off their last nuclear reactor.\nThis isn't, this isn't, it's unbelievable.\nThis is an island country that is, you know, seven days away from a total energy blackout if they get an oil and gas blockade from China, so that they can't bring in ships to deliver oil and fuel.\nUh, so they're, they're like at any given time, they're like seven days away from a total blackout, and they turned off their last nuclear reactors.\nWhy did they do that?\nBecause they cave to political, um, I would say minority, uh, like very loud vocalist, environmentalist activist reason.\nAnd they sort of this party ran on a commitment to turn off the reactor before they realized how stupid it was.\nUm, it's just like colossally stupid, by the way, turning off a reactor, like a real full-scale reactor.\nUm, it's not like an SMR where you can just like flip it on like a few days later or a month later.\nUm, you know, but like with these large reactors, it can take years to turn them back on.\nUm, and, uh, so it's just, just that was just terrible.\nBut broadly, I think the tailwinds for nuclear are just getting stronger where people recognize that, um, it is clean energy.\nUh, I think there's still messaging work to be done.\nWe should stop calling the spent fuel nuclear waste because it's really not waste.\nAlmost all of it can be recycled and reused.\nIt is, people do need to recognize that, like, there those tailwinds are shifting.\nSo that's happening.\nI think that people understand that it's base load power, right?\nSo it's not dependent on it only working during daytime.\nIt's not like hydro where you have to be around an appropriately configured water source.\nUm, and then I think that, you know, one of the largest inhibitors to creating new power plants in this country, um, it's not, it's not like that, you know, we, we, we can't do it.\nWe can.\nThere's a huge regulatory impermanenting, uh, I would say, morass that has to be, you know, swam through that is incredibly expensive, requires an army of consultants, um, many tens of millions of dollars, many, many thousands of pages of applications and documentation and process review, and again, this has to do with like building, building the power plant, getting the fuel, transporting the fuel, storing the fuel, each step along the way, um, is extreme, extremely, extremely laden with regulation, uh, and policy.\nUm, and some of that's for good reason, but finding ways to better navigate that to make it more efficient is really a step in an area that a lot of companies and people are focused on now.\nAnd actually, I think the government now is also focused on how do we streamline the approval process for a new reactor?\nHow do we start approving new reactor designs?\nUm, then I think the last thing I guess I would say is that, you know, not right now, if you're going to do a lot of, if you're going to put a lot of energy and work into building a nuclear power plant, you want to build a really big one.\nSo, like, we largely only see really big power plants in this country, like the AP-1000s that we turned on in Georgia.\nUm, and those again came in, I think they were 10 years late and like, you know, multiple billions over budget.\nWe are now starting to see movement, um, from the government, from in the DoD, in the Department of Energy, um, and from the national labs to really try to create a more fast-track process for these Small Modular Reactors, or even micro reactors, um, that use a much safer form of fuel, use much less nuclear fuel, use a different kind of nuclear fuel that's not nearly as risk-prone as the kind of nuclear fuel you or nuclear material you'd use in like a weapon.\nUm, it's not nearly as enriched to the same degree.\nIt's not even the same material.\nAnd so that process is now gaining a lot of steam.\nWe have an investment in a company called Radiant Nuclear.\nThey are building a factory that creates, um, what effectively is an SMR.\nThey would probably call it a micro reactor.\nUm, it's a 1-megawatt reactor.\nIt can be put on the back of an 18-wheeler and shipped around.\nYou can move it to where you need power.\nIf there's been a natural disaster, like a hurricane, and you need to bring in power overnight, you could bring in a truck, uh, you know, a few trucks with, you know, four or eight of these reactors and power up a whole city after a disaster.\nAnd so that kind of flexibility and power is really compelling.\nAnd then, you know, the last thing I guess I'll say about on the SMR and micro reactor side is that, you know, the United States military spends an incredible amount of money just around the dealing with the logistics of moving fuel around to forward operating bases.\nUm, anytime we do a military exercise, anytime we are engaged in a conflict, the movement of fuel factors in as a primary concern and consideration of what we deal with.\nAnd so, just think about the, and, and you know, we've read reports that they spend well over $200 a gallon, sometimes up to $400 a gallon for diesel effectively to get diesel into the right place at the right time.\nAnd so you can just imagine that having a nuclear reactor you can put on the back of a C130 and fly around the world to wherever you need power, drop it in the middle of the desert, turn it on, you have power for 5 years is just an incredibly compelling value prop.\nUm, there is no question that nuclear needs to be part of the equation.\nUm, not only is that the base load power, but on the SMR and micro reactor side, it gives us just incredible flexibility and grid resilience.\nUh, you know, there should not be a single military base in this country that's not nuclear-backed from a power standpoint because if the grid goes down, whether it's from a cyberattack or just instability or demand issues or cascading failures, you want to be able to fail over to nuclear power and not worry about the runway lights turning off.\nYeah.\nAnd especially as you we start to look at the kind of electrification of our weapon systems, our military vehicles, our, you know, drones, etc.\nLike those all have, have, uh, need to get charged up somewhere, and how better to charge them than a nuclear reactor.\nOther thing I'll add to your nuclear comment is like the, I think the advantage of nuclear, and I think that Radiant has done very well, uh, of really sort of leaning in on is the power density factor.\nLike you, if you want a reactor that is reliable, uh, and power dense, you want it to operate at very high temperatures, you want as highly enriched fuel as you possibly can where it's like makes sense commercially.\nSo, you want Halo fuel, um, and you want to serve customers that will pay the premium for that, that'll be able, they'll buy sort of this reactor, they know is going to work.\nAnd if you're doing that, you want to, you want to have as, you know, you want to have these economies of scale on the manufacturing side.\nYou want it to be done out the door and don't need to, like, you know, assemble it on site.\nYou don't want to have to, like, have constant maintenance.\nAnd I think, you know, the other sort of reactors that we see, you know, maybe on the civilian side, um, if you're going to start having to do, uh, you know, if you build a reactor in a factory or you build modular components in a factory, but you still need to do construction work on site, you're still a construction company.\nUm, like even if the technology is there, um, and I would argue a lot of the existing AP-1000 technology is quite good.\nAnd other countries can do it quite cheaply.\nChina is using a very similar design.\nThe UAE just built one for incredibly cheap.\nUm, they have very similar nuclear like regulation, um, like in terms of frameworks, and obviously their regulatory bodies might move faster and things like that, but they're not, they're not like, you know, completely ignorant of some of the concerns.\nUm, and so, you know, I think in, you know, high level, and maybe this is a much more broad question, the United States needs to get better at mega projects, things that are billion dollars, things that are at scale.\nUm, and I would argue, like, you know, the NRC is a big component of why it's expensive, but I think it's also, you know, the same reason that it takes a billion dollars to build a bike lane in San Francisco is why we are not able to build, why we don't, why we don't have a high-speed rail in California.\nYep.\nThere is a, I mean, we, we might not have a high-speed rail in California because nobody wants it, and nobody wants $100 to LA all the time.\nWell, nobody, sorry.\nNobody wants it where they're building it.\nSure.\nYeah.\nBakersfield is not a prime destination.\nIt could.\nI want to train from San Francisco to LA.\nThat takes an hour and a half.\nUm, me too.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd I mean, we debate a lot internally, like, where does it make sense for VCs and VC capital plug it to plug in, and like, arguably, like, we're not going to move the needle on, you know, these multi-billion dollar mega projects in the US.\nLike it doesn't, you know, we're not going to build, we're probably not the best people to figure out how to, you know, capitalize and build, you know, a multi-billion dollar project in California to generate the power for the grid.\nBut I do think that there is a role for a technology at kind of like every single layer and every single phase of how mega projects get built.\nIt's like, how do you use AI to navigate kind of site selection?\nHow do you, how do you use tools to, like, move through the various permitting processes faster?\nLike, how do you use AI to help you do extremely complex and interdependent project management better and more effectively?\nSo that's something that, you know, you have a project with 4,000 people working on it, and everyone engaging with different suppliers and timelines that are dependent on each other, like, how do you get all those things to align better, um, so that you don't get these 10-year delays, so that, you know, projects actually happen on time and on budget, and, you know, as a result, attract private capital, um, backers.\nLike, I, I think that there's a role of technology here, you know, what that looks like.\nWe've seen a lot of companies that maybe, you know, five years ago were primarily trying to sell to utilities and grid operators, which is incredibly painful, incredibly difficult, and perhaps rightfully so.\nLike, they have poles in the ground that are 50 years old.\nWhy would they trust a 2-year-old company to sell them software?\nAre they going to be around in 20 years?\nAnd this is a fair question to ask, especially for something as critical as the grid.\nUm, but now sort of they're developing this software, and there's such demand of understanding how grid operators might think, uh, and potentially get there faster or, you know, have different conclusions.\nAnd so now you can go to data centers or people who want to build solar farms or people who want to build massive like battery farms, and you can sell a very small, or even individual people who want to make sure that their power isn't going to go out, and they're going to be, um, you know, caught without energy during an important moment in their lives.\nYeah.\nAnd so there's, there's now, like, everyone cares now.\nThere's a lot more money who cares about what do what.\n\n\nIs the Grid actually going to think?\n\nWhere can I build? Where is there excess capacity? Uh, maybe, maybe I'm connected to the Grid, but, you know, I also need some battery and Solar backup or, or like a radiant micro reactor or something like that to, you know, to be used in certain situations. It's a lot more complex, this sort of micro Grid setup, but it's the way we're headed, and software is going to be a big piece of that.\n\nI want to hear more about our requests for startups or things that we want to exist that we haven't yet discussed, or, or maybe put differently, like I'm curious where we think there's most bang for the buck in terms of the issues that we've been talking about, in terms of there was like a regulatory intervention or some sort of technological unlock. What comes to mind?\n\nOne area where there's probably a venture scale software company to be built is really around Grid management, monitoring infrastructure. Like, you know, I think we see this in the IT landscape, we see it in the OT landscape, but we don't really see it in the Grid, where there's just full, you know, very, very large, like there is no Splunk for the electrical Grid. There's no Palo Alto Networks for the electrical Grid yet. Like there's a whole bunch of things that mirror the IT and OT landscape, whether it's around cyber and monitoring and logging and analytics. You know, there's no like Looker for the electrical Grid yet. There's just none of these companies exist. I'm not sure if it's three separate companies. I'm not sure if it's one company, you know, but there is a big company to be built in really managing and monitoring the Grid and helping to orchestrate and even deal with some of the things Ryan spoke around, around demand response, coordinating that, creating those marketplaces, tracking all those incentives. You know, so I think when we see a company that we think can really be the breakout company there, we would lean into it.\n\nI also think around sort of project planning and development. How do you make it faster and easier to build product projects within the current regulatory framework? You know, how do you do site selection? How do you navigate permitting? How do you, you know, how do you navigate project management? How do you navigate your sort of construction supply chain? You know, we're starting to see companies kind of pick off pieces of that, but I think, you know, broadly speaking, there's room for tech and software in that kind of project development space as well.\n\nAnything that can bring generation capacity or storage capacity closer to load, I think is going to be very compelling. And a lot of the times, it's less maybe the technology, novel technology, but it's sort of a system integration or it's an innovative business model. I think something like radicalizing that I experienced is, and I implore everybody to go home and check their power bill. They'll now often separate like the delivery cost from the actual generation costs. So, what we've seen, and we've sort of mentioned it, but like the cost to generate electricity, the cost of like power has dropped immensely, gas, Solar, things like that. But the cost to actually deliver that electricity has increased a ton. And so, in net, it's sort of not changed. Uh, and that's, you know, I think that's terrible, and I think we all agree that's bad. And so, I think there's a lot of opportunity of bringing sort of that generation capacity. In some ways, this is sort of like this, you know, more liberalizing force. It's like we all should have our own backup. We all should have our own technology. And I think there's a lot of really interesting ways to do that and scale it.\n\nOverall, as a Grid gets more heterogeneous, you know, all of the seams and intersections between things like that, there's just so much more opportunity for technology than, you know, when you had a single utility managing a single source of power centrally kind of distributed out, distributed out broadly. All the regulation and permitting and policy frameworks that we have in this country, you can sort of think of those as part of the like infrastructure that we all have to like live and work with and interact with. So, companies that really facilitate, and I would say applying AI to navigating the permitting process. So, Nuclear is a good example. Again, a Nuclear reactor application or a fuel transport license or a fuel manufacturing license. These things have thousands and thousands of pages of regulation and documentation that go with them. You make one small change in your application, it has these reverberation effects. You have to update all your documents elsewhere. If you're the regulator trying to go through all these applications, it's just incredibly onerous. Borderline impossible to imagine that a regulator can even possibly get it right. You could argue that it's actually not possible. They just do a best effort. But AI could actually help these things. Could help the applicants go through the process of filling out their applications and saying, \"Hey, this is where you should drill down. This is where you should clarify.\" They can look at all previous published applications and say, \"This is how you need to tailor it.\" You can probably make it 85% the same. And then based on your design or your location or whatever, make some modifications. And then the regulator can do the same and say, \"Look, here's an application that came in. Highlight all the areas that need to drill down or make sure or show me the things that are different from every other Nuclear fuel transport application we've ever seen. Are they using the rail infrastructure? Are they using the national highway infrastructure to move the fuel? Like, you know, just AI can just automate all these things that take armies of consultants, you know, months or years to do, can be, you know, brought down into being minutes or or hours. So, I think there's potentially, you know, I'm not sure how big of a company, but I think potentially there's a very large company to be built there.\n\nIf our check sizes were in the billions, not just the millions, which we're in, Jason Harwood, you never know. How would our strategy change?\n\nRyan, you're talking about mega projects. What kinds of mega projects?\n\nI think you need even more than just billions. It's tens of billions, hundreds of billions. It's such a tough question. I think there's, there's, there's, you know, tons of policy around this as well. I think I hesitate to say we should, we should look to how China has built up their Grid, but I think like, I think it's sort of the elephant in the room is like, they, you know, in the early 2000s, they were experiencing blackouts, like this was a very common thing, and this was horrific. But, you know, now they've, I think they've like 4xed their Grid, like in the last couple of decades. And so, the way they've done this is by basically deploying generation capacity, building hydro, building massive storage facilities, of course, BYD, CL, like tons of battery production. They built HVDC, sort of these large, sort of high voltage transmission lines. I would do all of that. I mean, look, I would look to all of it, and whether or not, you know, it's a good investment or not is going to be number, you know, look at a number of factors, but like, it is, it is much more of the infrastructure projects, sort of the glue that connects the stuff together. I think our lens today is looking at these technologies that enable a lot of sort of this more flexible Grid. But I think there's also going to be these large infrastructure, this the webbing in between it. And I think software is a big piece of it that we're spending a lot of time on, uh, looking at. But I think like, you know, how is hot going to be connected to the rest of the Grid, or how are we going to move this power around if, you know, it's really sunny in the Southwest, and there's like Solar is going to be really cheap? Is there an efficient way to move that to New York or something like that? And China's done this effectively. And I think, you know, if you had hundreds of billions of dollars spent or trillions of dollars, what does the Grid look like? Like it's going to be a lot more interconnected.\n\nAnother answer to your question, or a different answer to your question, is I think the Energy industry is probably medium to long-term, like one of the most prime spots to deploy physical autonomy. So, when you think about applications of robotics, whether it's humanoids or more kind of task-specific robotics, I, you know, I think these are the, we're talking about dangerous jobs, often we're talking about manufacturing jobs, to build up, you know, whether it's Small Modular Reactors or batteries or whatever. So, I, you know, I don't know what the shape of the company is here and how reliant it would be on some of the robot learning work that's happening, but I do think that, you know, there's going to be a, as we scale our Energy capacity, there's going to be a pretty massive application of industrial robotics to the Energy sector.\n\nYou know, like we survived the greatest Nuclear disaster in U.S. history just recently when we finished the Vogtle three and four reactors and let all those employees go back to other jobs. So, I think if we were writing a billion dollar check into power, what we would do is we would just give jobs to those people and not let them go back to whatever it was they were doing before they were building Nuclear reactors. And we would just really work to streamline the process to make sure that we go build Vogtle 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and all these different states around the country. And just put these people to work for the next decade plus building reactors. I don't think it's particularly our opportunity, but I do think it's an opportunity for somebody to do.\n\nI mean, labor broadly, like, I mean, this is a little tangential, but when Microsoft was building their new data center in Georgia last year, at one point they had on staff at Microsoft or on contract more than a third of the electricians in the state of Georgia. And they basically maxed out, they hired every single electrician that they possibly could.\n\nSo, I don't think it applies to just electricians. It's to, to your point, like the cement mixers. It's the, you know, mechanical engineers. It's the Nuclear engineers. Like, how do we actually train the next generation Energy workforce that we're going to need to, you know, modernize the Grid is a big\n\nBy the way, these are very high, these are very high-paying jobs where you don't have to check your email on your phone at like 9:00 p.m. at night after you go home from work. They're high-paying. You know, it's good exercise jobs, and they're relatively low stress. So, these are these are good jobs for people.\n\nI think one more, one more comment on this, and it's more of an industrial policy question, is like, we're talking about specific things, but like, often times that just moves the bottleneck. Like, we could, we could solve a lot of sort of the Grid connection hookup. We could build a lot of like transmission lines, but then we need more transformers. And to build more transformers, you need more electric steel. And it's like, you can do this, you can do the same sort of equation for much of the supply chain. Battery is another good example is then, okay, cool, we're building cells, but then we also need active materials, and we need to mine and things like that. And so, you know, it's sort of a whole effort of examining sort of our infrastructure and our supply chains, and you need to do all of it. And I think that's a, that's a complicated question, that's an expensive question. You know, people underestimate how critical and important a resilient, reliable, dispatchable electrical Grid is to our national security. You cannot have national defense and national security without reliable electricity. It's just not possible. So, all these things we're talking about are about the upside, about capitalizing on AI compute, the trans, you know, the switch to electric vehicles and our insatiable thirst for electricity. But at a fundamental level, there, there is no, uh, there is no safety, there is no national defense, there is no national security without a reliable electrical Grid.\n\nPeople want cheap, uh, reliable, cheap, and clean power in that order. And, and I think that's, that's, I think, largely how we should think about our Energy policy. And I, and I think that's, uh, I think that's sort of the direction we're going. And I think we need to make sure we stay aligned with that.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
