  "cleanText": "The great thing about consumer is it's completely unpredictable, and the best products emerge like out of nowhere. We're living in this early era of AI where velocity is the model. In the future, you're going to see consumer spend to be like food, rent, software. In some ways, that's sort of like the peak value of AI enabling better human connection.\n\nGuys, thanks for coming on for a state of consumer podcast. It seems like every few years there was a breakout, starting from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snap, WhatsApp, Tinder, TikTok. Every few years there was this sort of new paradigm, this new breakout, and it feels like at some point, just a few years ago, that just stopped. Why did it stop, or did it stop? Would you reframe how—how would you think about that, and um, where do we go from here? I would argue probably ChatGPT was a huge consumer, right, like outcome and winner in the past few years, and we've also seen a bunch of other ones in various other like modalities of AI, um, in like image and video and audio companies like Midjourney, and 11 Labs, and Blackforce Labs. Um, now things like Clean and Vo—um, mo—like weirdly though, a lot of them don't have the same like social or traditional consumer dynamics that you mentioned. I think because AI is still relatively early, and so much of the new products and innovation has been driven by research teams who are like so good at training models but historically have not been amazing at creating the consumer product layer around them. So I think the optimistic view is that the models are now mature enough, and many are available either open source or via API, um, for people to build great, more traditional consumer products on top of them.\n\nIt's interesting that you asked that question because I was thinking about the past what, 15 years, 20 years, where, as you said, like Google, Facebook, Uber—all all the names—and it's interesting because, you know, when you think about internet, mobile, cloud, everything together, there were all these amazing names, and you ask like, has that slowed down? I think um, the cloud, mobile—all that had a lot of maturity baked in, like the platform was around for like 10, 15 years. Every little nook and cranny has been explored to some extent. The changes that people had to adopt was Apple coming out with new features as opposed to changes that people need to adopt now is underlying relentlessness—uh, relentless—uh, model updates. So I think that's one difference, but the other thing is, again, just you touched on this, but if I think about the past historical winners, there's like information area like Google of the world, and now I think ChatGPT is certainly doing that, and they're the utility. We missed out like Box and Dropbox of the world, you know, more consumer—consumerry that people use where we also see a lot of the companies uh attracting and going after that—that use case, expression, creativity—same thing—the creative tools are endless, and that's happening. What I think is missing potentially is connection, like this social graph. This thing hasn't been rebuilt on AI yet, and that may be just a white space or something that we we just uh continue to see what develops there. It's interesting because, you know, Facebook's almost 20—20 years ago at this point. Like the companies that you mentioned, Justine, you know, aside from ChatGPT and OpenAI, like are they going to be around for 10, 20—like what is the defensibility of the companies we're talking about? And also the use cases of all the companies I mentioned—are they going to be disrupted by these new players, or in 10 years from now will they continue to be sort of the mainstream use case for all uh or mainstream application for all those use cases that they serve? I mean, you could argue that ChatGPT has got way higher business model quality than the kind of analogous consumer companies from the last product cycles, right? Their top skew is $200 a month. The top Google consumer skew is $250 a month. So, sure, there's a question of defensibility, networks, all these other things. But that might have been a response to the poor business model quality that would have occurred if you didn't have those things. Now, you can just charge people a lot of money. And perhaps we'd been overthinking it previously. There was poor business—uh, business model quality, maybe stronger sort of retention or product market durability. Yeah. Like you had to have a story for how this was like compounding enterprise value in the absence of just making money right away, and now these models and these companies are just making money right away. Yeah. I think the other thing is, Justine, you talked about this like all the foundation models are kind of pointy in different ways. So you could say, look, you know, Claude and the ChatGPT horizontal model and the Gemini model, like aren't they interchangeable? And doesn't that mean price pressure? But different people use them for different things, and it seems like they're raising prices, not lowering them. So I think when you like zoom in a little closer, you see that there are like some interesting defensibility dynamics that are already there. Increasing price, not decreasing—at an interesting point because monetization is clearly a different thing from previous era to AI era, especially for consumer companies. They're making money right away. And and I—what one thing that's always on my mind, and Olivia, tell me if you think that's not correct, but like the retention—when we talked about retention on the consumer subscription model before AI, it was—I don't know if we actually try to make a differentiation between unique user retention and revenue retention, cuz they were like kind of the same. Like you don't get to change pricing that often. You don't get to upgrade. Like it's kind of the same thing as opposed to now we make a very clear differentiation between unique user retention and revenue retention because people actually upgrade, they actually have all these like credits and points, they need to actually overages that they actually end up spending, so you actually see revenue retention being meaningfully higher than unique user retention, which again, like I haven't seen that before. So yeah, yeah. I think before the average consumer subscription was maybe $50 a year, if that. Like that was kind of a lot. Like the best-in-class consumer products would charge that. And now we have people very happily paying $200 a month. Uh, and even saying in some cases that they feel like they're being undercharged for that or they would pay more. How do we explain\n\n\nWhat value are they getting such that they're paying? I think it's doing work for them. Like consumer subscriptions in the past were around things like personal finance, fitness, wellness, and entertainment.  But they were things that ostensibly would help you help yourself, entertain yourself, but you would have to invest a lot of time to get the value from them. And now with products like deep research, for example, that could replace 10 hours of generating a market report by yourself.  And so that kind of thing is easily worth, I think, for many people $200 a month, even on one or two generations. I mean, I think things too like VO3; people are paying $250 a month. And I'm happy to pay that because it's like you have this suddenly—it feels like a magical mystery box that you can open and get whatever video you want, only for 8 seconds. But it's incredible, and the characters can talk, and you can make amazing things that you can share with friends, make personal memes of someone delivering a message to your friend with their name in it.  Create full stories that people are posting on Twitter and Reddit and all of these different places. It's sort of like nothing we've seen before in terms of what consumer products can actually do for people. It seems like every part of consumer discretionary spend is going to be overtaken by software, and I think, in the future, you're going to see consumer spend be like food, rent, software, and that's kind of where we're going—what Justine Moore is speaking to.\n\nCan you give some examples of that? Well, a lot of it is what Olivia Moore said. I think all the entertainment is being subsumed by it. A lot of the creative expression work that you would do outside of software is now being subsumed by it. A lot of the relationship intermediation, which might have been a place where disposable income spend is being subsumed by it. So all of the aspects of our lives are going to be intermediated by the AI models, and we're going to pay for that.\n\nBryan Kim, you're saying what we're still missing is connection from this new paradigm, and people are still relying on Instagram, Twitter, some of the other social networks of the past. What's going to get us to something new here? It's funny when I think about social, which is a category that I get so excited about. At the end of the day, a lot of it was status updates, right? Facebook, Twitter, Snap. It's just like, \"Here's what I'm doing.\" And through status updates, you feel connected to that person. And that status update showed up in different modalities. Used to be, \"Here's what I am, here's what I'm doing,\" to actual photos of where you are and what you're doing, to videos and short-form videos now. So now people feel connected to others through Reels and what have you. So I think that has been one era of feeling connected with others. And then now the question is, how can AI help that? How can AI feel like you're connected to other human beings and know what's going on in your friend's life?\n\nThe truth is, if I just think of a modality of photo, video, audio type things, I think a lot of it has been explored. Different versions and mutations of that have been explored quite extensively, especially on mobile. I think where we could get to—it's funny—I don't know about you guys, but I pour my heart and soul into ChatGPT. It knows more about me than probably Google potentially, which is an insane thing to say. Like Google, I've been using Google for a decade plus. And ChatGPT may know more about me than Google because I type more. I say, tell it more. I give more context. What might connection feel like when that essence of me is sharable with others? And I don't know if that's the next version of feeling connected, but I can certainly see a world where that resonates with a lot of folks nowadays, younger generation, etc., that are kind of tired of just looking at the surface-level stuff.\n\nI mean, we already see some examples of exactly that where there's all these viral trends where people are like, \"I ask my ChatGPT based on everything you know about me, write my five strengths or weaknesses, or like make an image of like who you think the essence of me is, or make a comic about my life,\" and people are sharing those everywhere. I posted one the other day, and within minutes I had dozens of people responding with their own and sharing stuff—people I didn't even know. I think the interesting thing, though, is so far the social behavior that has come from the AI creative tools largely, but also things like chat, is still happening on the existing social platforms and not in the new AI platforms. Like Facebook now is a lot of AI content potentially unbeknownst to some with audience. Facebook is like the boo AI slop, and then Reddit and Reels are like the younger people AI content.\n\nYeah, no, I agree. I think it's been a puzzle to me what the first AI social network is going to look like because we've seen attempts at, for example, a feed of pictures of you that are AI-generated. And I think the problem there is that to work, a social network has to have real emotional stakes. And if you can generate the content in a way that you like it, and you always look amazing, and you always look happy, and you're always in a cool background, it doesn't have the same sense of stakes. And so I don't think we've seen the version of what a ground-up AI social network would be. You use the word \"cumorphic.\" A lot of the AI social products that mimic Instagram feeds or Twitter feeds were bots and AI. Is that—that feels cumorphic? Like that feels like, \"This is what it used to look like. We're going to do it, but with AI,\" and maybe that's not really the form factor. And there's an additional hurdle in my mind that a true consumer product probably needs to live on mobile, and for AI products to work really, really well. I think there's still a little bit of work where the cutting-edge models can do to live on edge, live on the device side of things to really enable…\n\n\nThat. So I'm also excited to see what happens there. It seems like people's recommendation is the obvious use case at some point. Like, who would be good for me to start a business with? Who would be good for me to be friends with? Who would be good for me to date? We have, you know, these platforms get all this information about us. I mean, I think an interesting area that's, you know, maybe informative of where this all goes is if you look at the AI-native LinkedIn efforts. A lot of the observation is that LinkedIn is a pointer to what you know instead of actually containing what you know. And with this tech, we can create a profile that actually contains what you know. So I can talk to a synthetic Erik Torenberg and get all of your wisdom. Perhaps that's what future social looks like as well.\n\nThat's what you're talking about, Justine Moore, right? If the models already know who you are, then is there like a synthetic you you can deploy in an interesting way to interact with people? I don't know. Yeah. One thing I heard you guys say is that you wouldn't be surprised that you guys sort of realized was that enterprises are sometimes adopting these products first before consumers, which feels different from previous eras, or maybe not what we expected. What can we say there?\n\nYeah, that has been fascinating. Bryan Kim and I saw that a lot with ElevenLabs, which we were relatively early in. I think we invested; we did the Series A like a month or so after the initial launch. And I think what we saw was first the early adopter consumers got on board, and they were making memes, they were making fun video and audio. They were cloning their own voices. They were doing game mods. But then I would argue it hasn't even gone, in many cases, to the true mainstream consumer. Like it's not yet like every single person in America or most have ElevenLabs on their phone or have a subscription, but the company has these massive enterprise contracts and a ton of huge customers across like conversational AI, entertainment; tons of different use cases are using ElevenLabs.\n\nAnd I think we've seen this across a bunch of AI products, which is like there's an initial consumer virality moment, and then that actually leads to lead generation in enterprise sales in a way that we did not see with the last generation of products. Like enterprise buyers, there's so much of a mandate to have an AI strategy and use AI tools that they're watching places like Twitter and Reddit and all of the AI newsletters, and they're saying, \"Hey, this is some random—looks like a random consumer meme product, but I can actually think of a really cool application of that in my business and like become the hero for having our AI strategy.\"\n\nI've also heard of similar, on that vein, really exciting use cases of AI where you know you start with consumer virality. So, you know, from a company side, you get all this Stripe payment data. You look at all the Stripe cells and you basically put it in an AI tool to go try to find where they work. And then when you find out X more than X number of people working in that company, you reach out and say, \"Hey, by the way, looks like 40 people, 40-plus people are using our product. What's up?\"\n\nJust you rattled off a list of products and companies in the beginning of this conversation. What I'm curious is, do you think, just as examples, are they sort of the MySpace or Friendster? Are we in sort of that era, or are they, you know, the list of companies I rattled off that are still relevant 20 years later? Like, where are we right now?\n\nI mean, I think our hope always is that every big consumer AI company now that we see and love and use—all of the products, which we all do—sticks around. I think, unfortunately, that's not always going to be the case. I think maybe the interesting differentiation in AI versus the last era of consumer products or even two eras before is like the model layer and the capabilities are still improving. Like we have really not even, I think in many cases, scratched the surface of what these models can do. I think we've seen that in things like the V3 launch, where it's like you can suddenly have multiple characters talking; you can have native audio; you can do all of these things, like all of these modalities. I don't know; maybe we could argue about this with the tech people. The LLMs are more mature, but have the opportunity to just keep improving capabilities as they scale.\n\nAnd I think what we've seen is like as long as a company stays at what we say is sort of like the technology or the quality frontier, so as long as they sort of have a state-of-the-art model or are integrating one or something like that, they won't become like the MySpace or Friendster or whatever; like they just keep—you fall a little bit behind, you ship the new update, suddenly you're number one again, and you keep moving.\n\nThe interesting thing now, though, too, is we're starting to see even segmentation in that. So, like in image, for example, there's not just one best image model. There's like best image for designers, there's best image for photographers, there's best image for people who can only pay $10 a month versus the people who can pay $50 or $100 a month. And so I think there can be—just because, like Anish Acharya mentioned, people are spending so much—there can be multiple winners that persist over time as long as they keep shipping.\n\nI absolutely agree. I mean, even in video, it's like different video, but ad video, and then even in ad video, I saw a post yesterday. I'm like, this is best for, uh, you know, product shots, and this is what's best for, uh, videos with people, and it goes on and on and on, and each of those, I think, is a very large market.\n\nYeah. Say more about how we—I know we talk a lot about defensibility and moats and how that has changed in this era, how we've changed how we consider that topic. I've gone through a little bit of a come-to-Jesus moment on that, especially recently. I think moats have always been very important, right? The gold standard is this network effect.\n\n\nBeing part of the workflow, being a system of record—these are all very important moats. I will posit that that's still very important, but funny enough, the companies or investments I've reviewed with this \"moat-first\" theory haven't really been the winners. The winners in the categories we look at have always been the ones that break the mold, move really fast, have incredible model launches, and have incredible product generation speeds. I've sort of come around to the idea that, in this early era of AI, velocity is the moat. Whether that's in distribution, which is incredibly important and hard to break through these days, or product velocity, that's what wins the game because that leads to mind share.  And frankly, right now, mind share—users and traffic that actually converts to real revenue—gives you more ability to continue that journey.\n\nYeah, it's interesting. Ben Thompson, I think a decade ago, had a blog post called \"Snapchat's Gingerbread Strategy,\" where he was basically saying, \"Hey, anything Snap can do, Facebook can do better, but Snap is just going to keep coming up with the next innovation, and if they can just keep doing that, maybe that's their moat.\" He called it the gingerbread strategy. I think distribution and network effect ultimately kick in. Snap has that too, in its own corner of Gen Z and younger users as a core messaging platform.\n\nHow do we think about network effects with these new products? We're not there yet because it's mostly creation efforts right now. There isn't a closed loop with creation, consumption, network effect, and social network. So, we're still a little early before a network effect kicks in, but we see a different type of moat form in the likes of a Level, because it moves so fast and the product is very good. It gets into the enterprise and gets locked into the workflow. So, I think that version of a moat we're starting to see. I think the true network effect we're still looking out for.\n\nElevenLabs is an interesting example. I was making an AI-generated video the other day that needed a voiceover, and ElevenLabs, because they had a head start and the best models, had more people using the product. They could make the models better. All of these compounding advantages—they now have a library of people who have uploaded their own voices and characters. So, for me, when I was looking across a bunch of voice providers, if I needed a very specific, like old wizard mystical voice, ElevenLabs had 25 options that fit what I needed, where another platform might have two or three. So, I do think it's early, but we're starting to see signs of more traditional network effects like we saw with old marketplaces. They're not necessarily something completely new.\n\nI want to go deeper into voice as we talk about new paradigms and form factors. We got excited about voice pretty early on; it was the first framework I saw with a thesis around it. Anish, why don't you talk about what got you so excited about voice in this new paradigm, what's played out, what hasn't, and where you think it's going?\n\nThe original observation that got us started was that voice has intermediated human interaction since the beginning of time, and yet it hasn't been a substrate on which technology has been applied because the tech never worked. There were previous efforts—VoiceXML and voice apps—but it simply didn't work. The technology wasn't ready. Even then, there were pockets of interest, like Dragon NaturallySpeaking and other products from the 90s. So, there was always interest in voice, but it never made sense as a technology substrate. Now, with generative models, you can just use voice as a primitive. It's unexplored yet so critical to our day-to-day lives. It feels like a perfect area where you'll see a lot of AI-native efforts.\n\nI think we first got excited about voice from a consumer perspective—the idea of an always-on coach, therapist, or companion in your pocket that you can talk to. That has started to play out. There are lots of products where that's working. I think what surprised me is that, as the models got better, real enterprises have picked up voice so quickly to replace human beings on the phone or to augment what human beings are doing on the phone, even in sensitive and critical categories like financial services. Previously, they were using offshore call centers that had lots of compliance issues, 300% annual turnover, and were difficult to manage. So, we're still waiting to see what the first great, truly net-new consumer voice experience will look like. There are some early examples. People are pulling ChatGPT's advanced voice mode into fascinating directions. We've seen products like Granola blow up because they allow people to finally do something valuable with all the things they're saying all day. But the great thing about consumer is it's completely unpredictable, and the best products emerge out of nowhere. Otherwise, they would have been built already. So, I'm excited to see what happens in consumer voice in the next year.\n\nFor sure. It feels like voice is the AI insertion point for the enterprise, period. I think the thing that everybody is missing right now is that the mental model many folks have is that low-stakes conversations will be AI voice—customer support, etc. But what we've talked about is that the most important conversation that happens in a business…\n\n\nIn a given day, week, or year, interactions will be intermediated by AI because AI will do a better job with negotiation, sales pitches, persuasion, or friendship.\n\nWhat will be the first use case where people talk to synthetic versions of themselves consistently and relevantly? Why would they talk to AI Justine, AI Anish, or AI me? We've seen this with companies like Deli, which create AI clones of people with large knowledge bases for advice or feedback.  Brian alluded to this earlier.  What if we allow not just thought leaders or experts to have AI clones accessible via text, voice, or video, but unlock this for everyone?\n\nWe think a lot about consumers. Many people have skills, insights, or knowledge—a funny high school friend who should have a comedy cooking show, or a guidance counselor with incredible advice. How can we enable these people to scale themselves using AI clones or personas?  So far, this has been limited to thought leaders, experts, or fictional characters.  We saw this with Character AI, which added a voice mode.  There's a pull, especially with new technology, to interact with familiar characters from favorite anime series.  But we'll start filling in the middle—real people, not just fictional characters or thought leaders.\n\nPeople learn in different ways, and AI voice products cater to this. Masterclass launched a beta that turns people who've recorded courses into voice agents. You can ask specific questions, and it draws on everything said in the course, returning customized and accurate results. I'm a fan of Masterclass, but I lack the time to watch a 12-hour course.  I've had interesting conversations with Masterclass voice agents for two to five minutes. This shows how real people can become useful AI clones.\n\nHowever, do you want to talk to a synthetic version of an interesting person, or an entirely synthetic person perfectly matching your interests? What does that person look like? They might exist, but you haven't met them.  This technology can bring them to life.  What are the use cases for human interaction versus AI? Olivia's point about Masterclass highlights the value of feeling like you're talking to a specific person versus the abstract \"most interesting person.\"  Wasn't there a viral tweet of someone in a New York subway talking to ChatGPT as if it were a girlfriend?  Another example: a parent whose son asked endless Thomas the Tank Engine questions.  They gave him the phone with voice mode on, and he talked to ChatGPT for two hours. The child didn't know who was on the other end, just that it engaged deeply with his interests.\n\nIf we use ChatGPT or Claude for therapy or coaching, I'd prefer my AI clone therapist or coach.  We could record sessions for data. Therapists or coaches have so much online content that we could recreate them. In five to ten years, will top artists be AI-generated versions of Lil Michaela, or will they be Taylor Swift and her AI arm, or a duet? A little of both.\n\nOn Twitter, are the social characters we follow—the next Kim Kardashian—real people or AI-generated? I've thought about this for years, following Lil Michaela and K-pop bands that introduced AI hologram characters. This is tied to photorealistic images and videos. We're seeing influencers gain attention because they look realistic enough to be indistinguishable from real people.\n\n\nAI, or not? And there's a lot of debate around that. My take is probably there will be fragmentation into two types of creators or celebrities. One type is a Taylor Swift type, where the human experience matters. Many people not only love her songs but resonate with her life, stories, and live performances—things AI cannot yet replicate.  There's another type of celebrity or creator who is more interest-based, like Thomas the Tank Engine. It doesn't matter if that person has lived a real human experience; it matters if they're interesting to talk about or share content around a certain topic. So, I'd guess we'll still have both.\n\nThis gets back to the AI art debate: yes, anyone can generate art easier than ever, but it still takes a lot of time to make great AI art. We hosted an event with AI artists last summer, and their workflow for making an AI movie probably takes as much time as filming it.  But maybe they lacked the skill set to do it before. We've seen an explosion of AI influencers, but very few have risen to the top.  So, I think we'll see pools of AI talent and human talent, and the best of each will rise to the top—a low conversion rate on both, which is probably how it should be. Or non-human talent.\n\nAI unlocks interesting things. In V3, we've seen the street interview format, but with AI characters like elves, wizards, ghosts, or furry blob characters. That's interesting.  We see this in music too. AI-generated music often feels \"mid,\" because these are averaging machines, and culture is supposed to be at the edge. It's more a problem with bad art than bad artists; we're conflating those. It's not the AI, it's the bad art. If the art was at the same level, would people still want to hear from humans? 100%.\n\nPotentially. This leads to a philosophical debate: if you trained a model with all music before hip-hop, would it infer hip-hop? I don't think so. Music is the intersection of past music and culture, and culture is critical. You need something at the edge and outside the training data to create new music, and that doesn't exist in the models.\n\nSome of my closest friends, talented people, are working on a gay AI companion app. My 2015 self would be shocked, but 11 of the top 50 apps are companion apps. Are we at the beginning of that trend? Will there be many vertical companion apps?\n\nWe've spent a lot of time on every facet of companionship, from therapy and coaching to NSFW AI girlfriends. We've looked at everything.  It was probably the first mainstream use case of LLMs.  People try to turn any chatbot—car dealer customer support, etc.—into their therapist or girlfriend.  People want someone to talk to. A computer that talks back immediately, is always available, and feels human is a massive unlock for many.\n\nI'd argue we're just at the beginning, especially since current products are largely horizontal and come from base model providers. People use ChatGPT for things it wasn't designed for. We've seen individual companies create personalities for characters, embody them in digital avatars, and create games or worlds around them—getting a lot of engagement. Companies like Tolen do this for teenagers and college kids.  Another companion app lets you take a photo of every meal, analyzes the data, and gives you nutritional information and emotional support. For many, food and eating issues are tied to emotional issues, things they'd traditionally go to therapy for.  The definition of a companion has evolved quickly from friend or girlfriend to anything that offers advice.\n\n\nOr wisdom, or entertainment, or counsel you could have gotten from a human before. Um, and we're going to see even more vertical companions moving forward. One thing I thought about is, um, you know, having worked at a social company, there is a very clear trend of the average number of friends that you can talk to over time going down. I think the youngest generation—something above one. So I think the need for companion as a use case will absolutely be there. It'll be an enduring use case. It'll be something critical for actually a lot of people. So I think I'm very excited about the companion use case and, as Christine said, I think it branches out into different things, but the need for having a close connection to talk to will endure and, and perhaps, you know, we talked about how maybe connection is a missing area, white space, but maybe this is filling that in, right? Like as we, as we say, maybe you just need to feel connected to something; it doesn't need to be human. A lot of people, upon hearing this conversation of companions, just think, \"Oh man, people are going to have less friends; people aren't going to, you know, anymore,\" and people are—depression is going to go up. Uh, suicide is going to go up. Fertility, you know, going to continue to go down. I don't think so. This reminds me of my favorite post of all time on the Character AI subreddit, which I've spent an immense amount of time on, which is okay. And to set the scene, so there's all of these like high school or college kids who had their formative years during COVID, and they weren't really in person with other kids or teenagers or learning how to talk to people. And I think it really ended up impacting a lot of them. And one of those kids, I think he's in college now, had been posting on the Character AI subreddit about his AI girlfriend for a while. And then one day he posted that he found a 3D GF, so a real-life girlfriend, and that he wouldn't be returning to the subreddit for a while. And he actually credited Character AI for teaching him how to talk to other people, especially teaching him how to talk to girls, like how to flirt, how to ask people questions, how to engage with them about their interests. And I think that, like, in some ways that's sort of like the peak value of AI is like enabling better human connection and just less weird.\n\nYeah. Were people happy for him or did they call him a traitor? People were extremely happy. I mean, there were a few, I think, jealous souls in there who had not found their 3D GF yet. But I have hope for them. I think that's real though because I, we've even seen studies like, um, I think of the Replica product where, like, uh, actual studies were showing depression and anxiety and kind of suicidal ideation were going down in users. I do think there's this trend of like a lot of people don't feel understood and don't feel safe. And so then it's hard for them to be in the real world doing real things. And so if AI can help them, and and maybe they don't have the money or the time to go to therapy and and make all of these changes in their lives, and so if AI can do that for them, they can emerge kind of a transformed person that's then more able to do things in the 3D world as that character. You're talking to techno-optimists here.\n\nThe, the thing that really got me sort of aware of how big these companion apps are were, were when we did the first interview with the founder of Replica. It's amazing. Um, after they turned off—she turned off the NSFW stuff and the subreddit for Replica, and the comments in our video were basically a lot of people being like, \"Hey, this is like my wife when we stopped having sex, you know, like, like I already have this, this sort of neuter.\" And like so many people were just like, \"My life is…\" and I'm like, \"Oh my god, I didn't realize how big of a role this app was playing in people's lives.\" That is bringing out an activity that people have done for a long time, like people have had these like internet chat room, Discord relationships, like the, the Zoomers are, or have like Discord girlfriends and boyfriends. Um, in our day there was like this anonymous postcard website where you would go and send anonymous postcards back and forth and develop these like really deep relationships with like people you would never meet or you didn't know who they were, if they were pretending, if they were the person they were pretending to be. And I think AI just makes that like a deeper, more engaging experience. Well, so this is where I think an important point though is that the AI not be too agreeable because people in real life—I mean, there's a give and a take to human relationships, and like highly agreeable AI does not set you up well—set you up well for that. So I think there's sort of a, a fine balance between being just agreeable enough to help you like engage and get better at this versus being so agreeable that you're actually worse at this. I, I want to close with what's, uh, what's possible going forward. So, so maybe let's speculate on new platforms or form factors that could be game-changing. OpenAI just acquired Johnny Ives's company. Um, you know, Bryan Kim, I've heard you talk a bit about glasses and why you're still excited about that, that form factor. Maybe we could start there, but I want to hear from the group on what they could imagine as, uh, something that's additive or even disrupting some of the more use cases. There are 7 billion mobile phones out there; there aren't that many devices at all that actually, uh, gets to that level. So my thought process is either it will live in mobile, and for that there's many different ways to think about the future where there's a privacy wall around it or is a local, uh, local LLM or local model that helps you sort of really contain all the things that you want to contain in, in your device level. So I think I'm still very much excited about the model development layer to get to that, and I think that's what I'm actually most excited about. And then, you know, if you think about always-ons, as Olivia Moore said, like mobile, we have always-on, but there are other things we also have always-on, and what does that look like when there are net new devices or what have you, or appendages if you will, that like actually attach to things that you always have that actually can enable that.\n\n\nAny speculation from you guys? Is there a piece of hardware or something that we're going to be wearing or carrying around or using that's either attached to the phone or separate from the phone that could enable us? I think AI has scaled for consumers tremendously well, given it's mostly been textbox in, you know, some output in a web browser out. And so I love the idea of AI kind of actually being with you and seeing what you see. It's funny now when I go to tech parties, like a lot of the under-20s are wearing pins that record what they're saying and doing, and they find like real value from them. That's one example. We've seen a new wave of products that can see what's happening on your screen and take action for you, help you, um, coach you, other things like that that I also find really exciting. Um, and I think as also the agentic models get even better, it goes beyond just like suggestions to actually doing work for you, sending emails for you. Um, which is very exciting for me. I think, yeah, the human insight layer of that is big too. Like often we have no way of measuring ourselves compared to other people or sort of where we exist in the world. So, if an AI can hear all of your conversations and see everything you're doing online and say, \"Hey, look, like if you spend five more hours a week doing this, you would actually be a world expert in this topic and like based on this vast network of other people I'm serving, like you should connect with these three other people and like this person could be an amazing co-founder. You should like date this person.\" Like that sort of thing. That to me is the ultimate, yes, like sci-fi vision of which comes from AI being with you all the time and something that's not just like a ChatGPT textbox.\n\nTotally. I mean, the device that has been most widely adopted post-phone is the AirPods. So, that feels like the thing that's hiding in plain sight. And there's a whole bunch of like social protocol questions around it, cuz it's weird to have your AirPods in at dinner. No one does that, right? But there may be a way that you can integrate AI and also fit the current social protocols around AirPods. It would be interesting.\n\nYeah. You said something that we glossed over, but young people at parties are recording their conversations. Like, yes. In the future, is everything going to be recorded? Like, you think that generation is already growing up with that norm to some degree? Or yeah, I think there'll be new social norms developed around this behavior because I think it's like real and it's valuable, and so it's like scary I think for a lot of people that this is happening, but I think it's a wave that started and is not going to stop. And I think the context matters too. Like, I think a lot of what you're talking about is like the SF networking parties where like work and personal stuff like really blurs. We talked about this. You could do that in SF, do that, did that party and brought a pin in New York, canceled. Yeah. But I think that's why there'll be like a new set of cultural norms, like when the cell phone was introduced, like there's places where it's rude to take a loud call, like this, the same set of things will emerge around these recording devices.\n\nYeah. Well, it's let's end on this idea that we're that we're very early. Uh, guys, this has been a great conversation. Thanks so much for coming on.\n\nSuper.\n",
