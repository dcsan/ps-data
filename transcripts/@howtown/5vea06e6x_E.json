  "cleanText": "Before we started this channel, Adam and I did some googling to find out what people were searching for after \"How do they know?\" That's how I found this post on Reddit. It was talking about Prehistoric Planet, the BBC series that uses CGI to give dinosaurs the planet Earth treatment. This is Prehistoric Planet. The poster just really wanted to know how they know these things. So, I got comfy, turned on the show, and in episode three, I fell in love. A giant terasaur, *Helaxus*. Look at that majestic, bizarre creature. Terasaurs are technically not dinosaurs, but they lived at the same time, and this was one of the biggest. There aren't any humans for scale in *Prehistoric Planet*, so I called in a favor.\n\nOkay, first impressions. It is really hard to get me and this thing in the same frame. That's Lexi McQueen, one of our Patreon members and a friend of the show, standing 5'8\" tall next to the scale model of *Quetzalcoatlus* at the Field Museum in Chicago. I mean, it's really giraffe-like in its height and then it has this huge head on top. But the evidence that *Quetzalcoatlus* really existed in all of its glory... the only thing that it left behind is this pile of bones from its left wing. Okay. So, we don't even have any part of the head here. No part of the head. So, how do they know what it looked like or how it moved? I called up a bunch of paleontologists to find out how they reconstruct these animals and which parts are basically made up for TV. But before we get to that, I want to quickly thank the sponsor of today's video, which is Storyblocks. It's a stock library, but they don't just have video. They have sound effects, music, they have still images, they have After Effects templates, which I think is really handy, and it's all one subscription, right? It's all one price. So, you don't have to pay peace meal for each asset that you download. So, to get started with unlimited stock media downloads at one set price, go to storyblocks.com/howtown or you can just click the link in the description. One of the things that they do is that they recommend music to pair with some of the clips on their site. And so I've got this cool super zoom clip of Big Bend National Park. And that's where our story begins.\n\nOh, a spectacular discovery being reported by fossil hunters digging in the barren flinty soil of the Big Bend region of Texas. And it was so big I thought it was a dinosaur, but the texture of the bone of these terasaurs is different. That's Douglas Lawson. He found the fossils of the largest flying creature presently known when he was a master student at the University of Texas and he named it *Quetzalcoatlus northropi* after an Aztec god and a designer of military planes. That was early 1970s. I was not born yet, but growing up in Texas and in paleontology, it, uh, *Quetzalcoatlus* looms large. You must be Mr. *Quetzalcoatlus*. Yep. Always a pleasure to meet a fellow terasaur.\n\nA team at the Smithsonian was even inspired to build a half-scale model that could actually fly for a 1986 IMAX film. But despite the media attention, Lawson ended up leaving paleontology and nobody published a full write up of the fossils until 2021. Brian Andre was part of the team that finally got it done. He's a lifelong terasaur enthusiast. I've tried to see as many terasaurs as I can. In fact, on our honeymoon, my wife suggested going to Iceland because they definitely didn't have any terasaurs there that I could go and take a look at. His 150-page report described two *Quetzalcoatlus* species. The big one known from these wing bones from two individuals plus some other fragments that are suspected to belong to the species and a smaller one, *Q. lawsoni*, which was compiled from a much larger number of specimens found 40 km away from the giant. And he mapped out their place in the terasaur family tree. This line is the meteorite that wiped them all out. And right up to the end there's *Quetzalcoatlus*, part of a group called the Azhdarchids.\n\nWhere does that come from? It feels sort of Tolkenesque or something. I believe it is Persian in its roots. Persian. Okay. When you find a humorous of an Azhdarchid, you're like, \"That's an Azhdarchid humorous.\" I know it like the back of my hand. Like, how do they... If I saw that, I'd be like, \"That could be a triceratops for all I know.\" You know what's... I mean, when you read the papers, they basically describe every ratio possible on all of these bones and they are looking for bumps and little features and they put this all in a big data matrix table and if it, you know, has enough things in common with other Azhdarchids, they can then infer the sort of evolutionary relationships between them. Azhdarchids are toothless with long limbs, but the strangest thing about them is their stretched out neckbones. This one was found in Jordan in the 1940s. It's so long that for decades they didn't realize that it was part of a neck. That seems so weird because you see, like, if you look at... I think I'm thinking about other things with long necks or a whale. You know, you see whale vertebrae all the time or at least you do on the West Coast and they're just like giant versions. And so they're like the little discs that just stack, right? And this does not look like a little disc. No, it's quite unusual.\n\nAzhdarchid giants have been found all over the world: *Arambourgiania* in Jordan, *Hatzegopteryx* in Romania, *Cryodrakon* in Canada, and *Thanatosdrakon* in Argentina. They were the largest flying animals the world has ever seen. But they're also known from just a handful of bones. And there's a reason for that. Let me take this. This is a box. This is more or less how we would expect the terasaur bone to be, especially the wing bones or leg bones. So they have a thin layer and sometimes the sediments, because they are so heavy, they will just crush the bones. So many fossils are very flattened. When we have a 3D preservation, we're going to see much better on the bones. The *Quetzalcoatlus* fossils are 3D, so already that's rare. But it's worth dwelling a bit more on the journey that these bones took over the past 70 million years. First, cats needed to die without being destroyed by other carnivores. You want these things to be kind of as preserved as quickly as possible, and part of that is burial. Rapid burial is preferred. A river needed to overflow pretty quickly, pick it up and carry it to a quiet spot where it could sink and be buried by sand. And so he got... well, they got deposited by the movement of sediment through the river. It had to spend thousands of years undisturbed while the minerals in the groundwater filled up the pores in the bone and turned it to stone. And millions of years later, tectonic shifts needed to lift up the section of rock containing the fossil. I can't tell you how much rock was originally on top of *Quetzalcoatlus* at its maximum amount. I just know that eventually it got down to zero when we took it out. The timing of that erosion needed to be just right, too slow and *Quetzalcoatlus* could still be buried today. But if the erosion was too fast, then the fossil would disintegrate before Doug Lawson could spot it or perhaps even before the evolution of a primate that could do science. And so you just need a lot of things to kind of line up. So really to fossilize anything, but especially to find something big in a river, it was... Yeah, it was amazing that it ever happened at all.\n\nSo we love the fossils. We're grateful for the fossils. But how do you get from this to this? And why are experts so sure that these older depictions are wrong?\n\n[Music]\n\nFirst, there are some things you can say about all terasaurs. We know from fossils that they laid soft shell eggs. Many had fuzzy bodies, and it's reasonable to guess that Azhdarchids did, too. And all terasaurus had the same type of wing. So, here's my hand. Um, terasaurus don't have this finger. Forget about it. But they have four fingers. So, I have, um, like one bone here, two bones here, and several smaller bones here. They also they do as well. We all have this elongated bones in our palms and in their cases sometimes the elongated bones could be very, very large. And then we go to the fingers themselves. So they had like three smaller fingers that look like claws and the fourth bone was very, very long. So that's completely different from any other animal that has ever lived on Earth. That really long finger held up the fleshy membrane that made up their wing. All terasaurs had it. But if you don't zero in on closer relatives, you're going to get some things wrong. So in the '70s when they found *Quetzalcoatlus*, they had some big terasaurs to look at, but they, um, they didn't have any Azhdarchids to scale it up from. So they were assuming very, very long wings because that's what other large terasaurs had at the time. It had a wing spread of 51 ft, greater than the height of a five-story building. When we found better Azhdarchid wing material, we realized, \"Oh, actually the end of the wing is quite truncated.\" And so you suddenly bring that estimate down.\n\nMark Witton is a paleontologist and paleo artist who consulted on *Prehistoric Planet*. Before he draws a giant terasaur, he has to build out its skeleton using clues from other Azhdarchids like *Quetzalcoatlus lawsoni*, the smaller terasaur from Texas for which there is a partial skull and *Zhejiangopterus*, a flattened but nearly complete Azhdarchid found in China in the 1980s. When you look at the specimen, when you look at photographs of it, the fossilization has not been kind to those bones and it's a little bit of a mess. Uh, but it was very important to me as an artist looking to reconstruct terasaurs because it did give us things like the length of the torso which wasn't... it's not information we have from any other Azhdarchid. Scaling up from its smaller cousins gives you a *Quetzalcoatlus* head that's around 2 1/2 m long. Here's Victor Wanyama for scale.\n\nDoes it make sense to just extrapolate in that way to just be like, \"Well, the head to neck ratio is going to be the same for these two species or the head to, you know, humorous ratio is going to be,\" because I can imagine like at some point it's like a head just gets too big no matter what is attached to it. I was wondering that too and there's a couple reasons why they think that this is the right ballpark. One is that there are a couple of skull bones from *Hatzegopteryx* and they really do justify a huge head for that giant at least. The other argument they make is that terasaur body frames are generally conservative in the sense that within a family of terasaurs you don't see drastically different proportions from one to the next. So they had big heads. Exactly how big, we're not sure, but they were big. So yeah, you know, for giant terasaurs, um, as with many other giant prehistoric animals, we are having to, to, to, um, I wouldn't say speculate necessarily, but we are definitely extrapolating a lot. And and that, that's, you know, that's if if we're being 100% honest. There's no way of knowing exactly what we're doing is correct at the minute until we get more specimens. In the meantime, paleontologists are really resourceful.\n\nWe didn't kill the alligator just for our purposes. It's very important to say that all those animals we studied, they were already going to be euthanized. It's a method called phylogenetic bracketing. Birds and crocodilians are the only surviving archosaurs and they share their common ancestor with terasaurs. So, if there are soft tissues that both birds and alligators have, it's likely that terasaur had them, too. When Tissa and her colleague dissected birds, they saw this rough patch on a certain part of their neckbones. They found it in the alligator, too. It's where this ligament connects the vertebrae, like an elastic band. When they looked at Azhdarchid's neckbones, they found those same rough patches at the top of the neck and toward the bottom, but not in the middle. That's a hint that its neck was stiff in the middle, not bendy like this older documentary suggested.\n\nA lot of birds kind of curl up to sleep. How... how would it... how would it Azhdarchid... would they just be like on the ground just like, \"Ah...\" Well, yeah, why not, right? Why not? That neck wasn't well suited for fishing while flying. Instead, when the researchers modeled the rest of the Azhdarchid's neck muscles by looking for those rough patches on the bones and then checking them against the birds and the alligator, they see a neck that was built for craning down by bending here, grabbing prey off the ground and springing back up to swallow it.\n\nSo their study focused on a smaller Azhdarchid. But there's another big clue that tells us about the lifestyle of the giants.\n\nAre those footprints? They're footprints. Exciting. The way that they know that these are Azhdarchid footprints... I don't even want to say that they know that. The reason they think that is that they don't know of anything else big enough to have made them. And they correlate in time with the period that Azhdarchids were active. And the dotted line you see right here is kind of the midline. And what this showed was that they were really had their legs and arms underneath them. So they're quite upright, right? They're sort of like as opposed to like... Yes. sort of clumping around like we saw in those early videos, they're more like sleekly, which is a more efficient way to move, of course. And the other thing that they can see is a very like particular walking style. The footprints actually are dropped down in front of the handprints. So what that tells us is that when the animal is walking, they have to move both sets of limbs on one side of the body at a time and then nor do the other ones. You've seen this before in giraffes and camels. It helps them avoid tripping over themselves. So, all signs point to giant Azhdarchids hunting on land and being surprisingly comfortable.\n\n\nWalking, which makes you wonder how much were these guys actually flying. For that, I reached out to Michael Khabib, who has spent a bunch of time modeling terasaur flight with software. Is there any debate about whether these largest terasaurs could fly?\n\nThere is not much serious debate, I would say. He told me that when birds become flightless, that tends to change the skeleton in obvious ways. One of the things you would expect to have to happen would be to continue to get your bones stronger. All right? You would start to thicken up the bone walls. What the big terasaur are doing is the opposite of that. They're making the diameters mega huge and the bone walls very, very thin. In order to get into the air, he says that they would have needed to use their flying muscles for takeoff, which meant a quadripedal vault off the forlims. What happened after launch is more of a mystery. They might have soared long distances on columns of hot air. Or maybe they were burst flyers who just traveled far enough to escape danger. We don't know if it was a soaring specialist or not. We do not know cuz we do not know the wing shape. We have not a single wing membrane preserved for a giant azarid. We don't even have a wing membrane preserved for a big azar kid, much less a really big one.\n\nThat's just the start of what they don't know. They don't know how they held their legs during flight or whether they would have worked together. They don't know their colors. They don't know their sounds or how they tried to impress their mates. But they know that giant flying reptiles lived on almost every continent more than 70 million years ago. They can see their general shape, how they moved, and what they ate. And they know that there are almost certainly more fossils to be found.\n\nHuge thanks to Lexi McQueen for being our Field Museum correspondent and for supporting Howtown on Patreon.
