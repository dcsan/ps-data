  "cleanText": "By the way, should we talk about the fact that you mailed me your teeth?\nYeah.\nSo creepy, Adam.\nI recently sent Joss two of my baby teeth.\nOne scavenged from a series of nested boxes in my garage.\nAnother discovered by my parents.\nHere it is.\nI knew these teeth could tell me how much I had been poisoned as a child.\nAnd Jos was able to hand them off to another New Yorker, one of the world's leading tooth detectives.\nTeeth are like a time machine.\nIt allows you to travel into your past.\nAnd one of the things that we can measure really well is this toxicant called lead.\nLead is so so poisonous.\nExtreme exposure causes violent hallucinations, convulsions.\nIt can kill you.\nBut it turns out even tiny amounts of lead can mess up your mind, body, and personality.\nAnd recent studies have found that about half the population of the U.S. was exposed.\nHow has those exposures changed the course of American history and health?\nIt could rate as one of the largest environmental injustices in human history.\nI wanted to find out what was in my baby teeth, if lead had quietly altered my mind, and how a poison so subtle you might not notice it managed to reshape the minds of 170 million people.\nWe partnered with Riverside on this episode.\nThis is Herbert Needleman, the man who helped expose the hidden harms of lead.\nHe was a pediatrician, a professor, and sometimes a tooth fairy.\nIn 1975, Needleman was at Boston Children's Hospital studying the effects of lead on children in these workingclass suburbs.\nAt the time, it was common to test for lead by drawing blood.\nBut that only gave a sense of recent exposures.\nNeedleman knew that if he wanted a record of exposure from infancy, he'd have to look at teeth.\nYour first teeth start forming months before you're born.\nAnd one of the major building blocks is, of course, calcium.\nLead looks a lot like calcium.\nIt has the same charge and a similar size.\nSo the body readily absorbs it and lodges it permanently in our teeth.\nSo Needleman knows that teeth contain this record of early lead exposure, right?\nIt's the lead exposure that they would have had in the womb and then their first couple years of life.\nAnd so he went to elementary schools and recruited teachers to collect the teeth.\nAnd the kids got a badge in return.\nAnd apparently this was quite the prize because as they're sifting through all these teeth, the researchers found dog teeth.\nThey found human adult teeth and little white rocks.\nThey had to institute a system where the teachers checked that the kid had a fresh socket to match the tooth.\nNo counterfeit teeth.\nIn the end, Needleman's team collected and tested over 3,000 bonafide teeth.\nFrom there, he was able to sort the kids based on their lead exposure, and he asked their teachers if each student had these different behavioral problems.\nA clear pattern emerged.\nKids with high levels of lead in their teeth or blood are more distractable, less persistent at their work, less able to follow sequences of directions because they forget what they started out to do.\nWere there big uh demographic ranges of these kids, or were they similar in in most of those ways?\nThese were pretty homogeneous communities in the 1970s.\nThese were basically like Italian and Irish families.\nWell, that that that's that helps mitigate some of the concerns you would have about subjective teacher ratings because we we've seen studies showing that they can evaluate their kids with a racial bias.\nNext, Needleman went in and actually tested the kids, gave them puzzles, and listening challenges to measure their intelligence, focus, reaction times, and the kids with more lead in their teeth from infancy scored worse.\nIt remained to be seen how this leaded generation would fare when they reached adulthood.\nAnd we'll get to that in a second.\nBut first, I want to pull back the curtain and explain exactly how we made this episode.\nI started as usual by reading a ton of papers and interviewing some experts.\nAnd then I talked to Jos for an hour or two about what I found out.\nLet's go.\nAnd to record our calls and interviews, we use Riverside, the online studio for recording and editing video and podcasts, who actually partnered with us to make this episode possible.\nWe've been using it since the very beginning of Howtown because it provides better video and audio quality than a simple screen recording and it's pretty easy to use.\nFor this episode, my parents webcam was super low resolution, so they just downloaded the Riverside app on their phone and it worked out great.\nOnce you've got your recordings, you can edit them right there in Riverside.\nYou can get a transcript for textbased editing and then there are a bunch of tools.\nYou can enhance the audio quality.\nYou can remove filler words.\nYou can automatically switch between camera views and of course you can export your files to use in other programs.\nThis has been a great tool for us and now you can get 10% off a Riverside subscription by following the link in the description and entering coupon code howtown.\nThat's creators.fm/howtown code howtown.\nOkay, now back to Boston and a part-time tooth fairy's disturbing discovery that a bunch of first graders had been doled by lead.\nWell, that raises the question of how this exposure was happening.\nDid he know exactly how it was getting into these kids?\nOne of the infuriating things is they they kind of knew where the lead was coming from for decades.\nWe're going back to the good old days, putting time in reverse gear.\nSince antiquity, humans had known that lead was dangerous.\nBut thousands of years later, Americans still used it a lot.\nIt was nice and flexible for plumbing and made paints much brighter.\nAnd according to the lead industry, it was actually pretty healthy.\nThis coloring book for kids was published by the National Lead Company.\nThen in 1921, these researchers at General Motors found a new use for lead.\nThey had been struggling to deal with engine knock, sudden uneven fuel explosions that wasted power, damaged engines, and made for a bumpy ride.\nIt was discovered that a rare compound of lead, tetraethylled, made an ideal antiox fuel, faster, smoother, more resilient power.\nThey named their product Ethel, which conveniently omitted the lead part, and had a gentle feminine vibe.\nBut not everyone was convinced.\nDr. Alice Hamilton, the first woman on Harvard's faculty, was the nation's leading expert on lead poisoning.\nIn 1925, at a conference about tetrathylled, she walked up to GM's head scientist, Charles Ketering, and told him, \"You're nothing but a murderer.\"\nShe warned about the death of workers who came into contact with tetraethylled and the danger to the public from breathing exhaust gases, but no one really wanted to hear it.\nAmerica was busy remodeling its economy around cars and there was lots of money to be made.\nThis is crazy to me.\nThey knew about this millennia ago and they and and we get to Gen X and they're still I mean, why how is that possible that they were still allowing kids to be exposed to this stuff?\nI looked over the next 40 odd years of papers on lead exposure and most of them come from a single lab that was named after Ketering and funded by General Motors and the Ethel Corporation.\nThey focused on acute lead poisoning which allowed them to say that the science behind chronic exposure and long-term harms was unresolved.\nTheir work reassured the government and the public that all that leaded exhaust dusting playgrounds and paint chipping off walls that was probably fine.\nThis is the most serious environmental disease of children and the lead industry has attempted to obscure this.\nThe more we study lead, the more we find effects at lower and lower doses.\nLead is so harmful in trace amounts because of that ability to mimic calcium.\nCalcium plays a key role in signaling throughout the nervous system and lead disrupts that.\nInfants are particularly vulnerable because their brains are still getting wired up and they often have higher exposure for the simple reason that they're always putting stuff in their mouths.\nNeedleman saw the effects of this in Boston.\nAnd when he tested other communities, he realized that this tragedy wasn't impacting every part of society equally.\nSo one out of 14 privileged white children had an elevated blood.\nFor poor whites, it went from 7% to 25% and for poor blacks, it was 55%.\nWe're talking about 3 to 4 million American children are at risk for brain damage due to lead exposure.\nAnd that is a datam that our society will reject at its peril.\nA poor neighborhood is more likely to have more old houses with lead paint and to be close to major roads.\nWhen I think about my exposure, my childhood home was built in 1960, so before 1978 when lead paints were banned.\nBut there wasn't much traffic on my street.\nThe parks where I often played, on the other hand, were right next to an interstate highway.\nBut luckily for me, decades before I was born, the U.S. got an unlikely environmental champion.\nAll set.\nThat's right.\nClean air and clean water.\nThese are part of the birthright of every American.\nWe must act and act decisively.\nOkay, the other one.\nWhen Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, he set into motion a slow phasing out of leaded gasoline.\nThis line shows the amount of lead from gasoline per capita over the years and blood lead and children and adults drop.\nThat was a real public health trial.\nSo we make the transition to lead free fuels.\nBut the story isn't over because lead is about to make the U.S. a more violent place.\nMurders are on the rise and the statistics are really grim.\nEach of us is concerned about the rate of crime.\nCrime crime.\nCrime.\nI made this graph with data from the FBI that shows the national rate of violent crime.\nIn the early '90s, America's leading criminologist, nicknamed the Dean of Death, predicted that these rates would stay elevated or keep on rising.\nInstead, they fell.\nAnd experts are still debating exactly why.\nA lot of people in social science were thinking about the decline in crime, which at that point was still like confunding everybody, right?\nWhen I looked over newspapers from this time period, I found lots of articles crediting new policing strategies and the waning crack cocaine epidemic.\nBut Jessica Walpa Reyes was one of the researchers with a different theory.\nI was pregnant with my son living in a very old house in Harvard Square and I learned about lead exposure.\nIn looking into that, I discover needlemen.\nRight.\nBy this time, needlemen had shown that the Boston area kids with higher exposure were more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd other studies found that higher lead exposure meant increased risk of juvenile delinquency and arrests for violent crimes.\nIt's affecting the whole life trajectory of the individual.\nKids born in the early 1970s when leaded gasoline was peaking would have reached adulthood around 1990.\nThose born during the phase out in 2000.\nIf you shift the lead exposure curve forward 22 years, it lines up with crime pretty well.\nBut I have been cautioned against laying lines on top of each other like this and drawing a causal connection.\nThere's a whole website that demonstrates why this is dangerous.\nTyler Vegan's spurious correlations.\nIt finds lots of lines that overlap nicely.\nSo, you know, no one's saying that like eating margarine is causing divorces in Maine or if you name your child Jordan, they're going to rob a bank in South Carolina.\nBut these are pieces of data that really line up really well.\nYeah.\nI mean, part of this is you you actually have to have a mechanism, right, for this kind of thing to be persuasive.\nAnd obviously these ones don't there's no connection but with lead and crime there is a plausible connection but is there something else that we go further to confirm it right so you know it's hard to look at one pair of lines and say there is a causal relationship but if you were able to have a bigger sample size like this is a sample size of basically one the entire United States we're just looking at how these two curves relate but what Jessica did was she broke broke it down by state.\nIt's kind of like a natural experiment where different states had different time paths over the reduction of lead and gasoline.\nSo, what would you expect if lead was behind crime?\nStates with larger decreases in lead would see larger drops in crime.\nAnd that's exactly what Jessica found.\nYou can't come up with another story that would explain exactly why lead would have moved in this particular way in these particular states and then crime would have moved in a matching particular way 22 years later.\nFor every 10% cut in childhood lead exposure, she saw a roughly 8% drop in violent crime.\nThe economists were all like, \"Those effects are so huge, they can't be real.\nYou got to be crazy.\"\nAnd the public health people were like, \"Yep, that's how big it is.\"\nThey were like, \"Yes.\"\nMhm.\nThat is true.\nLeaded gas had been used everywhere and now is being phased out everywhere.\nAnd researchers were able to find a lead crime connection in some other countries.\nOther places, the connection wasn't as strong, and people still debate how much of the crime drop was caused by the phase out of lead.\nI've seen estimates as high as 90% and as low as 7 to 28%.\nJessica's calculations fall right in the middle.\nEither way, I'm convinced that while there are obviously a ton of factors that influence crime, lead is an important part of the story.\nWe started out looking at these little kids first and second grade.\nThen by this lead crime hypothesis, they're looking at crime in the '9s.\nSo these kids are now in their young adulthood.\nWhat happens when these these young adults grow up and are now in 2025 in their 40s and 50s?\nAnd that's a really hard question to answer partly because it's just really hard to follow people throughout their lives.\nNeedleman did a follow-up with his kids like 10 years later when they were graduating high school and he was only able to get like less than half of them to participate again.\nSo that skews the entire study because the people who are doing the worst, if they're, you know, dead or sick or in prison, it's harder to find most likely to participate.\nSo to investigate the long-term effects of lead, we have to go to the other side of the world, 1970s New Zealand, and the southern city of Deneda.\nResearchers attempted to track the health of every single baby born in this hospital in one year, 1,037 babies in total.\nThe New Zealand cohort has sometimes been referred to as the best studied people on Earth.\nAcross the lifespan of this study, recruitment each phase has remained really high up in the sort of mid 90%.\nWhich is really important because it means we don't miss the people who are doing the worst.\nAnd what are they asking these these people when they check in on them?\nAre they taking blood?\nAre they doing really their professional lives, their their mental and physical health?\nThey do blood tests.\nThey do uh cogn\n\n\nIt cognitive tests.\nThey do psychological exams.\nAnd one of the tests they did early on was for lead exposure.\nNew Zealand had some of the world's highest levels of lead in its gasoline.\nFor some reason in our cohort, kids from wealthy families were exposed.\nKids from poor families, kids from middle-class families.\nThere was no social patterning to lead exposure.\nBut it meant that we were able to ask, what are the long-term consequences of childhood lead exposure across the social spectrum?\nThis graph breaks up the subjects into groups by lead exposure, least to most, and shows how much their IQ has changed from childhood to when they were 38.\nNow, I should mention here that the researchers aren't holding up IQ as some perfect measure of intelligence, and they acknowledge that it's been misused and misinterpreted in the past.\nWe don't really have time in this episode to unpack IQ, so I highly recommend you check out Veritassium's deep dive on the subject.\nAnyway, the point is that IQ has been around for so long that it's a useful way for researchers to track cognitive health.\nAnd the ones that we use are standardized so that we can compare people to themselves over time.\nThe kids with the highest exposure actually lost more IQ points as they aged.\nThey also had altered personalities.\nThey were less agreeable.\nThey were more neurotic.\nThey just seem to struggle more with regulating emotions, planning for the future, staying organized, and that affected their social mobility.\nKids with low exposure tended to do better than their parents.\nAnd then kids with high exposure actually experienced downward social mobility.\nIt's pretty compelling.\nIt's not just changing how distractable you are in first grade, but it's having a lifelong impact.\nThis study and others like it established the long-term effects of lead on individuals.\nBut Aaron wanted to use these findings to calculate the effect on an entire country, specifically the US.\nFirst, he gathered leaded fuel levels and blood lead tests to estimate the childhood exposure of all Americans.\nThis graph has a bar for all the 10-year-olds, all the 11-year-olds, all the way up to 85.\nThe subset of each group who saw the worst exposure levels are shown in red.\nFor certain year cohorts, there's almost no one who wasn't exposed to levels that today would trigger case management.\nIn other words, if you tested that high today, a doctor would want to find the source of the lead.\nAnd that unsafe level was experienced by everybody on this graph outside this deep blue color.\nIt's about half the country, 170 million people.\nGen X was hit the hardest, but some millennials were still hit by the tail end.\nAnd I wondered what color I would be assigned on this graph.\nSo, so that that is your baby tooth.\nOkay.\nWow.\nManish embedded my tooth in epoxy and sliced it in half.\nAnd then he hit the open face with a tiny laser.\nHe ran the stuff that was blasted off through a spectrometer that read the concentrations of different elements at a 10 micrometer scale.\nThe first element he looked at was barium.\nBreast milk has more barium than solid food or placental blood.\nAnd so a surge in barium marks the moment breastfeeding began.\nYou can just see that little thin line before that.\nThat's your prenatal history.\nThat's what you were doing as a fetus.\nAnd now this is lead.\nThe levels are very low.\nThey're hovering in the blue green area which means you're very low.\nYou were born after the peak of the lead exposure crisis.\nIt also depends on whether you're the first born or the second born.\nMuch of the lead that comes to the fetus comes from the mother's stories.\nMost likely your mother was alive, you know, and exposed to lead because all of that generation was.\nThen the first born really is absorbing or clearing out most of the lead from the bones.\nSo I'm guessing I remember you saying you did have an older sibling.\nYeah, she flushed out the lead for me.\nSo that was, that's in medical terms, you wouldn't put it quite like that, but maybe you can, you know, you can buy her a coffee.\nWhat would this look like for someone born today?\nIt would look even more blue, and that's what we are saying, except and it really depends on where you are born.\nThere's still some high-risk locations in the US, for example, older housing in East Harlem.\nAnd this is the baby tooth of someone who encountered much more lead than I did.\nThe red line most likely shows where they inherited their mother's lead stores in the womb.\nAnd then the green area indicates unsafe lead exposure after birth.\nAnd if there was lead in this person's teeth, there was also lead in their brain.\nSomething like 800 million IQ points had been lost by the US population.\nThe population who grew up in the late 60s across the 70s and early 80s would have lost the most IQ points.\nAnd there were other effects on our minds.\nThese curves show how lead shifted the distribution of ADHD symptoms for different generations.\nAccording to Aaron's model, for some cohorts, the average person has more symptoms, and the extremes have shifted up as well.\nThe effect is similar for anxiety and depression.\nAt least 150 million cases of mental illness requiring treatment that wouldn't have happened if we hadn't put lead into gasoline.\nAnd as these cohorts age, we're sure to see more health effects from lead, cardiovascular problems, kidney, liver.\nI have a hypothesis that we might see greater rates of things like dementia, the lead exposure of the past.\nIt's not actually in the past.\nWe live in a leaded world.\nIt is not just about crime, right?\nAnd it is about all sorts of social behavior, just the ways that we relate to each other.\nLead is still mined in all of these countries and it's still used in products, especially batteries.\nAnd I guarantee it's not going to stay in those products.\nIt's going to find its way into our water, our soil, our food, our bodies.\nWe've been successful in the United States to some degree by being able to phase out lead from our main sources of exposure.\nBut old sources of lead occasionally still cause problems.\nIn Flint, Michigan, changing water chemistry caused lead pipes, which are actually normally pretty safe, to corrode.\nAnd in Milwaukee, just this year, lead paint from some old schools made its way into children.\nChild lead exposure tracked to a Milwaukee public school.\nThey asked the Trump administration for help managing the crisis, but everyone at the CDC's childhood lead poisoning prevention program had just been fired.\nYou fired the entire team whose job it is to support communities like Milwaukee.\nKennedy claimed these cuts had been an accident and a week later said this.\nWe have a team in Milwaukee and we're working with the health department of Milwaukee.\nBut that wasn't true.\nThat came as a surprise to leaders in Milwaukee.\nIt came as a pretty big surprise that formal support has ended with the termination of the childhood lead team.\nRecently, Kennedy got around to rehiring the team he had accidentally fired, and he says that he wants to eliminate more toxic chemicals from the environment.\nMeanwhile, history makes it clear that industry won't regulate itself.\nThe approach we took with lead is mirrored by countless other products we're using now where we like to say, well, if we can't see a harm, let's just use it.\nAnd sometimes, let's just use it even if we do see harm.\nJust one example, researchers found evidence that a common pesticide was hurting the brains of babies.\nBut after Dowo Chemical donated $1 million to Trump,\nmy friend Andrew, chairman CEO of Dowo Chemical Company,\nhis EPA director refused to ban it, saying the science remains unresolved.\nYou can get it really wrong for decades before you do something about it.\nThe long-term consequences of giving industry even freer are going to be horrific.\nIt's a lot of work to put together these episodes, and the best way you can help us make more of them is by becoming a
