  "cleanText": "Welcome to Just Curious. Today, I'm joined by Alex Goryachev, a globally recognized AI and innovation leader who's led AI and emerging technology initiatives at some of the world's biggest companies: Cisco, Dell, IBM, and Pfizer. Alex has spent over 20 years at the forefront of Digital Transformation, designing AI and emerging technology strategies, training workforces, and ensuring that AI delivers real business value, not just hype. Today, we're going to discuss how to restart and scale AI projects that have stalled, and how AI is reshaping the workforce, and what leaders need to do to prepare for transformation. Let's dive in. Alex, welcome to Just Curious.\n\nStu: Thanks for having me. I think, uh, thank you for that description. Yeah, AI keeps evolving, and I'm glad to be a part of that evolution or revolution, depending on how you look at it.\n\nYeah, you've been involved in emerging technology for many years. Maybe we can start by sharing a little bit more about your background, and I'd love also to hear how that experience informs how you think about AI.\n\nThat's a great question. Maybe I can start from an experience perspective. I've been at the forefront of the digital revolution over many years, be that cloud, mobility, or digital entertainment, or frankly, building web pages—um, when it was uh, decades ago—being stuck in a computer science class, all of a sudden realized that whatever—whatever my professor sitting there in one of the best universities in the world and looking around and saying, \"Oh my god, those things are not going to get me employed; these things are going to put me in more debt,\" because the things that I really want to know and the things that are moving the world are not being taught anywhere. And I feel that's the story with the emerging technologies; they quickly emerge, they become things of the past, and then we learn about them retrospectively. And AI is one of them. It's one of the biggest things right now, and 10 years from today, we're not going to be talking about AI, and CHP might be just history.\n\nYeah. Um, we're going to talk a little bit about how to restart failed AI initiatives. One of the most common reasons why AI projects fail within an enterprise. I think a couple of reasons. I think the most important one is people are so enumbered with technology, and actually, when you ask me about my experience with emerging technologies, people feel that a lot of leaders, stakeholders—well, first of all, um—are involved with technology versus what this technology enables. So every time I look at the news article or some marketing copy, I see this \"AI-powered AI AI something,\" and I'm like, \"What the hell is that? Do we have blockchain or internet solutions or anything like that?\" I hope not. So AI is another technology, and I feel that people confuse the technology with a business process, and most of the—in a nutshell—most of the AI projects fail because they're driven by technologists as a technology without any cross-functional collaboration and without any connection to a business process. So, in essence, we're putting a—this is out of order, right?—we're we're doing R&D versus rearchitecting our organizations. Uh, and I guess is—is the problem there sort of a solution looking for a problem versus the problem and then finding the right solution, whether it's AI or not.\n\nI think I think the problem is fundamentally—I think the problem is fundamentally that a lot of organizations perceive AI as an IT technology issue. That's number one. And number two, we're hiring the wrong people to lead AI. If we go and look at most of the job ads for AI leaders, we will hear the words \"Python.\" What are some other things that are very relevant today, and they will just like many other things in technology, they're not going to be relevant 6 months from today or 6 years. Those skills will be obsolete and irrelevant. But we're not seeing people that are into critical thinking, into collaboration, in business process, all those other things—communication—that that will be even more relevant with AI. So I think it's a very narrow technological pathway that is about technology and automation versus people and process. I want to spend more time on people and process in a minute, but I do want to revisit a failed project and how to restart it.\n\nYou mentioned in an earlier conversation that you were involved in rescuing one of these AI projects that had stalled or failed. Can you walk us through that story? Uh, tell us a little bit about the project and then how you went about getting it back on track.\n\nYeah, I mean, where do I begin? There were, to be honest, there were a lot of—there were a lot of these, and as I mentioned, regretfully, there will be more of those, and I want to say there's two things that I want to highlight. I think the most failed AI project is in the one that I've been on is where we have an IT organization that is developing an AI solution that is being funded, and there's an R&D cycle, and they're trying to develop an enterprise AI solution. And let's imagine for a second that they're on time and on budget, which is rarely the case and wasn't the case in this organization. But what the organization failed to understand is that the rest of their employees are not going to wait. They're going to take their own credit card. They're not even going to expense it. Spend $20 a month and acquire their own individual IT AI solutions so that they can get their own time back and spend time doing something else: moonlighting, playing pickleball, spending time with their kids or loved ones. And this is the problem that—shadow, I call it shadow AI. A recent LinkedIn study said that about 70% of employees bring their own AI to work. And that was exactly the problem. The organization was investing money in AI, but their employees were already using it without any guardrails, without—with different use cases. So there was a big disconnect. I mean, frankly, it was trying to meet a need that no longer existed because that need was met elsewhere without any kind of policy, security, guardrails. So there was a huge disconnect and a huge vulnerability for the business, and the way that I really approached it is going back to employees because they're the drivers of AI adoption. It's not it. These are not executives. Like if you go into university—I work for a lot of universities—who are the drivers of AI adoptions? Not professors, not the board of…\n\n\nTrustees. These are students that need to go and write their term papers, and they're going to use every means possible to get that done as fast as possible with the least pay. No difference from a workplace. So the way that we really approach this is going back to employees and understanding what are the tools they're using, what are the use cases, why they're using it, and how. And then saying, do we really need to build our own, or what do we build? What do we consume? What completely reshapes the way that the organization consumes AI? And it's a long answer, but I feel every organization wants to build something that's going to meet their needs. And I think the acceptance that, with AI, we live in a highly fragmented world where there's a lot of applications that are developed every minute, and asking employees is a far better approach than going into a lengthy R&D process. I hope I answered your question.\n\nYeah. So you've got an issue here where there's a top-down deployment. There's bottom-up experimentation, but they're misaligned. The first step is really just to understand how people are using it. Uh, and then where do you go from there? Um, how does one sort of, you know, resolve that tension between the top-down and the bottom-up once you understand how people are using it within the organization? You can't resolve that tension. I—there's problems in life that can be solved and those that can be managed. So the first step is acceptance. This tension will always exist, thankfully, because that tension is the engine of innovation. So I think the step number one is rethinking: Do we need to build an AI solution for the enterprise? It's build versus buy. And if we're building something, can we actually maintain it and keep up with R&D in the market? I bet in many, many cases, unless we're in a very specialized and regulated industry, the answer—the answer might be no. I think in most cases, the answer will be \"hell no,\" that's impossible. Recognizing that tension and understanding what are the areas in business where those guardrails really need to be established and the data AI needs to be deployed and it needs to be home-brewed, home-developed versus what are the areas of business where that AI could be consumed from a third party and empowering employees to go and innovate and find those tools. And your role then in helping the organization understand that is really evaluating how people are using it, helping them make a decision about what use cases are most logical for AI, and then helping them decide whether this is a build or a buy. Um, I think, to be honest, I think thank you for that. I think the number one thing here is managing risk, right? And I, of course, I want—I want to get them to build versus buy, but when the companies are doing—I think most of the companies right now in the AI space are exposed: one is they're spending a lot of money on their internal solution, or they're betting on a single vendor while their employees are already using tools and might be leaking confidential proprietary data or doing some other things using AI where there's more and more vulnerabilities. So the number one step is taking an assessment of how AI is being used in the enterprise that requires safety and trust because most—so creating that safety and trust would be the second step because most of the people in the enterprise or the organizations use AI despite the policy, in violation of the policy, and forget about the policy. What policy? We're innovating. It's the AI world. So most of the AI use in the enterprises is in the gray zone and non-compliant. Getting people to talk about it. Creating that culture of safety is a number one step. Second thing is people are afraid of using—they're telling other people that they're using AI. They don't want to be laid off. I know a lot of people that are doing three jobs thanks to the AI on W2s. They don't want to be laid off. But having a safe conversation about this is another step. So once we manage risk, once we create safety and understand what's going on, then we can talk about what are the strategies to manage this. How do we manage risk? How do we keep this culture of innovation that emerged going? How do we make sure that we don't punish people for helping them do their work best, and employees often know how to do their work best, not the people in the corner office? Empower people to do the results and then invest money in the AI development where it needs to be invested.\n\nYeah.\n\nHow does that resonate? It resonates. Uh, you mentioned early on that AI is about people and processes as much as it's about technology. Can you share a little bit about how you've worked with organizations to design AI reskilling programs? Thank you. Um, my—I think my number one customer and my favorite customer are Human Resources, right? People talent because, at the end of the day, when we think about AI, AI is going to reinforce us—AI is forcing us to restructure our workplaces very quickly, and in most of the organization, AI does not have—Human Resources does not have a seat at the table when we—and it's the most impacted organization, and I'm not talking about the fact that they're flooded with garbage resumes that are generated by AI that all look identical—that's the least of the problems—but because we're introducing AI, we're fundamentally changing the process of how everything is being done in our companies because a lot of work will be automated, which means that we need different talent, different skills, different business processes. The first organization that I really want to empower is Human Resources. So I help them understand why their role in the AI journey is critical and why they need to co-lead AI deployment or initiative. If I think about, for me, any AI initiative has at least two co-owners: IT and Human Resources. If one is working without the other, that initiative is going to fail. So I help Human Resources understand their role and then look into the future, understanding how AI is going to affect their enterprise, which means—and people don't want to talk about it most of the time—some employees will exit, some employees will need new skills. So let's get ahead of that. If we know that employees will be exiting, let's figure out a plan on how we can re-prioritize them on some other areas of the business or how to make sure that they have a soft landing elsewhere.\n\n\nWhat are the new skills that they will need to develop? Right? And again, we're talking—when we're talking—psychological safety. A lot of people talk about cybersecurity and this governance, ethics very important. Let's not deny this. But most of the organizations that I go to, people are on edge because AI is being introduced. They're uncomfortable. They're scared. They're fearful. And in order for us to innovate and use that AI wisely, that needs to change. And that's where I come in. And that's why creating the safety is the first step in AI adoption.  Yeah. What mindset shifts need to happen for employees to feel empowered by AI rather than threatened by it? I think the mindset is not with the employees. I think the mindset is with the Leadership and it really comes down to two things. I think one is: stop treating AI as an IT initiative and start treating it as a horizontal business transformation project. And then the second one is: realize that your employees are already using AI and they know how to use it best. So ask them, let them, and provide them guardrails versus doing AI projects in isolation without getting employee input or hiding things from employees and then getting that resistance. Yeah. And if AI is a horizontal business transformation opportunity, not an IT project, who should own this? You mentioned earlier in the prior example that Human Resources and IT should collaborate around upskilling, but when it comes to these horizontal projects, who should be the owner in an organization? Is it owned by just individual business units? Is it owned by Strategy? Is it owned, you know, collaboratively across multiple business and functional units? How does this work? I love this question, right? It's like when we talk 5 years from today or three, this question will no longer apply because it's like who owns innovation? Who owns the internet? Nobody does. It's everyone's job, right? It's horizontal. But like you said, in order to get there, it depends on the organization. In the regulated spaces, that's a whole different game. So, let's put banking and pharma and other things aside for a second because there's regulation and there's certain ways of doing that. But I really feel AI is a cross—at this point—AI should be an absolutely cross-functional endeavor with every single function represented and you can't—you can govern by committee—but this is one of those things where people—people need to get on board—trans—AI is one of the biggest change management initiatives of the few decades, that's for sure, and um probably the one that will have the most resistance—definitely cross-functional—definitely needs to sit at the neutral party, so and I—when I look at the neutral party—it's usually either Operations or Corporate Development, Corporate Strategy, or the Office of the CEO. Yeah. And I guess one—one challenge with respect to companywide AI adoption is that the Leadership may not be super familiar with the technology and how to use it. Uh, you work with Leadership teams to get them to use AI. Tell us a little bit more about that and why it's important. Well, I—a couple of things. I mean, I think if the Leadership is close to retirement, it's not important because they'll—they're—they're going to retire. If the Leadership is not close to retirement and they want to keep their job, it's very important. So, they probably—I just want to say I think AI—I—I hate to use the word disruption, but AI is very disruptive. And in most of the corporations, I feel the Leadership feels that they're unsinkable as long as they can use the buzzword of the core. I think AI is going to prove them wrong. So if they don't learn it and if they don't understand it, hopefully they saved enough for retirement because at a certain point they'll just become unemployable, right? So that's why—and that is exactly the conversation that I have with a lot of leaders and I ask them how scared are you and the answer is usually: I am very scared. If they're closer to retirement, it's: we're scared for our kids. If they're early in their career, they're scared and rightfully so because it's a—it's a technology that moves fast—faster—past—and my advice to them is to start using this technology in their everyday life. So we talk about using AI for having a difficult conversation with their spouse, improving their diet, and so many other things because they can't really lead AI transformation if they don't understand how AI can help them transform their life. And I literally talk to them about how AI is a good tool in them becoming better humans and it resonates and people start using it and then they have those aha moments like: if this helps me with my—with my teenage daughter, this can help me in my old age. And people start using it. I know it's—it's probably not the answer that you were—yeah—that you were expecting, but it's the answer that works because it resonates with them. We all want to be employed. We all want to be of value. We all have fears of being irrelevant and we want to—to be better humans and we want to have more time back. So AI allows us to do that whenever it's in the personal life or professional. And how does that—how does that understanding inform companywide adoption? Oh, I—I love this question. I'd say I would speculate that mo—in many organizations—the companywide adoption has occurred and I often talk to—I often talk to executives and I say: have you adopted AI? And they say: no, we're not using AI. And then I would go and say: hey, can you go to—if it's within your policy and if it's acceptable—can you go talk to your IT team and have an experiment and then look over a month where your traffic goes to which AI tools? When they come back and usually—not in a month—but in a week—it's a very different conversation with a different sense of urgency. So employees already adopted AI. They're probably not telling anybody about it for—because they don't want to be laid off for whatever reason. But the adoption has occurred. The challenge is transforming that adoption in a way that's compliant, safe, secure, and serves all of the—and serves the business horizontally and meeting a pragmatic business metric which is either growth or cost reduction or time to market and that really helps rethink that. But I do believe that the adoption has occurred. Yeah. So many—I was talking literally—\n\n\nI was talking to a senior vice president of a large company. He said, \"You know, Alex, I don't know how to tell this to my admin, and I don't know what to do. I was asking her to do letters, and I like her very much. We've been working for many years, but I discovered that with AI, I can actually like my letters, and it's much faster, and I don't have to wait for three drafts. I think she's on edge because I've stopped asking her for anything, and I'm doing all the things myself, and I really like it. How do I rethink this situation?\" Don't ask me because I don't have an answer for that. But I'm already seeing this type of thing. AI is being adopted by executives, but they don't know how to tell their admin.\n\nYeah.  Yeah. And so it's not really, in your perspective, an adoption issue. It's an effective utilization issue for organizations to really get value from AI. And so, if you're meeting with a Leadership team and they want to utilize AI effectively, what are your three biggest recommendations?\n\nMy biggest—there's three things, really. The first one is to start using it themselves. That's one. I'm going to go with four. The second one is to go and create some kind of a policy. A lot of organizations don't have policies, but create a loose policy of using AI. So at least we know what the red lines are that we don't need to cross. The third thing is to go ask employees how they're using AI and what they want to do with AI and tie it to three metrics: better, faster, cheaper. So either growth and quality, time, or cost. And then go back to employees and say, \"How are you using this? Give us ideas on how we can use AI and save 20% on cost.\" And guess what? Make a commitment to your employees that you're not going to lay them off because they're going to tell you how to do that. Promise that you'll give them a bonus. And I'm not kidding because I was in those discovery meetings for AI where people sat across the room, one-on-one, looked at me and said, \"Dude, you're here to kill my job. Why would I tell you how to train AI?\"\n\nYeah. Pragmatic metric guardrails, safety, and sharing the value of AI adoption with their employees. Yeah. What's a realistic goal, an AI goal that a company should set for the next 12 months?\n\nI think a very realistic goal is don't go out of business. Um, if the companies are—I'm not here to sell AI. I'm just going to say a simple fact. If companies are not using AI, their competitors that do will undercut them either on margin because they can do things cheaper or on time because they can do this faster. So if companies are not using AI, they will go out of business. This is a broad statement. There are some exceptions, right? But as a rule of thumb, if you're using a fax machine today—and I know many insurance companies do—but they're in a protected, different field. If you're not using email today, you're out of business because you're too slow. So if you're not using AI, you will be obsolete. So one is to start using it and start using it pragmatically. And the realistic goal is to move the metric on time or taking the cost out. That is a very pragmatic goal. And I would suggest every organization would say, \"Okay, we're going to run an experiment. We have our existing processes. We're going to go to our employees and we will ask them how we can do things either faster or cheaper. And then, in the next—not 12 months, too long—in the next 90 days, we're going to build and implement and deploy that. And we're going to recognize people that did it, and then we're going to put them on something else and reinvest the mining growth and do something else with this and run this quarterly AI innovation sprint.\" I've been doing this with companies. It's very successful, and a lot of the ideas are coming from employees that are secretly using AI or know how to use it. And I think most of the leaders will be surprised what would come out of this pragmatic approach, and what would come out is time savings, talent retention, and employee satisfaction.\n\nYeah. You mentioned the uncertainty that many employees feel when it comes to AI, and the focus on efficiency is really code for needing fewer people in the future. Some people feel that AI-driven automation is going to lead to mass layoffs. Others say it's going to create more jobs than it replaces. What's your take?\n\nMy take is very simple. Of course, it will create more jobs. The question is when. It's going to create a lot of jobs for people that are in reskilling. That's why I work with a lot of educational institutions because we will need to create and develop new skills. If we look at it historically, 67% of the jobs that exist today did not exist before 1940. Most of them are because of the technological process. However, it doesn't happen overnight. So will new jobs emerge? Of course. We can trace back AI to the invention of electricity. In a way, it's connected, but it took a very long time between the invention of electricity and AI. So, yes, there will be more jobs, but in the short term, there will definitely be a lot of attrition because of a lot of automation. And I feel that it's very important that organizations are very conscious about it and they think twice whenever they want to increase their margin and cut costs everywhere and lay people off and automate, or they want to invest in innovation because if you cut people off and you just automate, you stop innovating. Innovation doesn't come from AI. Innovation comes from frustrated people. So my advice to organizations is to reinvest that capital into growth. Regretfully, that's not the behavior of most companies. Most companies are looking—in a way, most companies are driven by increasing margins, and um, they can optim—and I feel with AI they have a risk of optimizing themselves to death. Was that a pessimistic or an optimistic? What's your take on this? Was that pessimistic? It's a little bit of…\n\n\nBoth, but um, I think it's a lot of—I think, for me personally, uh, and I agree with you. I think it's going to create a lot of opportunity. It's going to create a lot of disruption in the short term. The question, and this is a, you know, a tale as old as time for each, you know, emerging technology—whether it's a cotton gin or the computer or the internet—it's created more opportunity in the longer run. It's just that that short term, when jobs are lost and new jobs aren't created, that is complicated. And certainly, with AI, it's going to create a lot of complications. The more upskilled you are, I think the better you're going to be positioned. Hopefully, organizations will take your recommendations and not only upskill their employees because it creates opportunity for them, but also because, um, it creates opportunity for the employees in the longer term. But we'll have—Yeah. And I can show them how, right? And that's why I'm so excited about working with educational institutions because there will be a boom of people trying to get new skills. I think an IBM study that came out maybe 6 months ago said that 60% of the global workforce would need to be retrained and is impacted because of AI. These are incredible numbers. And when you think about people going back to school, whatever that form of education will be, that's going to be an incredible number—something that we've never seen before. Yeah. For organizations who are like, uh, listening to this, who is a good fit for your work? Uh, someone who's listening to this thinking about, \"I have a need to upskill my uh, my team,\" my organization maybe has adopted it, but I'm not sure we're effectively using it. Um, who would be a good fit to reach out to you? Well, I'd love to talk to them. And the thing is, if I don't know something, I'll help find—so I'll I'll share that. I think with AI there's a lot of unknowns. If you—I'm not comparing myself with Sam Altman—but if you ask Sam Altman how AI works, he will admit he doesn't know, right? So there's a lot of unknowns in the AI space, and I feel I can, for the things that I know, which I feel is the organizational transformation, I will be happy to help them. And I know within your network and what you're putting together with Just Curious, there are a lot of qualified people that can solve a particular problem for organizations. Yeah. Um, Alex Goryachev, I really appreciate you coming by Just Curious, sharing your perspectives on adoption and upskilling and the need for organizations to take this like seriously, lest they don't and get outcompeted. So, thanks for coming by. Thank you. It's a pleasure. Thank you so much.\n",
