  "cleanText": "Today on Just Curious, I'm joined by Melania Calinescu, a PhD mathematician, strategic AI advisor, and the founder of AI4ALL Solutions. Melania helps executives and investors evaluate where AI belongs in their businesses, how it creates real value, and how to spot the difference between marketing and actual innovation. Today we'll talk about the biggest misconceptions around AI, what real AI due diligence looks like, and how she helped a private equity firm avoid overpaying for a healthcare technology company by uncovering hidden risks behind their flashy demo. Melania, welcome to Just Curious. Happy to be here, Ste. You've worked across Europe and Silicon Valley as both a builder and a strategist. What first pulled you into the world of AI? First and foremost was my passion for mathematics, which is why I ended up having a PhD in applied mathematics. I do love solving complex problems that create practical impact, and yeah, that took me to being a data scientist, building models that solve actual business problems, and then that spanned the full length of driving strategy as SVP AI because as technology evolves, we do want to use that technology for creating real value in society. Throughout my entire career building AI ML systems, I was always puzzled not just by the mathematical problem that I was solving, but also how that plays out in the full organization and how we align technical possibilities with business strategy. How do we make sure that technology is what drives growing the business altogether? I often very often believe that that gap, because it always exists. I'm pretty sure everybody that is listening has experienced this at least once, the gap between technical side and business side because they speak different languages. Yeah. What AI has done now with the ubiquitous use of tools such as Chad DPT is basically kind of bridging that gap a little bit because we do use it and we feel like we understand it a little bit more. But then it created a different type of gap, that of the full confusion that is around this massive technology that I know people fear that one day it will just come and take over everything and also the hype that is driving now executives and investors in implementing AI tools right now or throwing money at everything that is AI first and just looking at flashy demos left and right and not really really understanding what the technology is. So that's what brought me to where I am today. I do want to help people really peel the onion layers on what AI is and fundamentally is just a collection of very sophisticated mathematical models. And since I do love math and solving problems, I want to transfer that over to people that have to now bring AI into their businesses as they need to evolve as we are all as a society kind of demanding for that evolution of the technology as well and organizations with it. Many companies want to do something with AI, but they're not sure what. How do you help them figure out what actually matters? Yes, that is definitely the most common question I receive, and the number one step that I start is what are your customer problems? Because in this world of flashy demos and let's be AI first, that's the fundamental question that we often overlook, bringing AI into an organization and building it into a product or service that the company sells should start from the question, what business problem are we solving with AI, not vice versa, as in we got to bring AI and then we'll figure out what to do with it. So that's the number one step. Second, depending on the size of the company, depending on the industry, looking at what are the constraints, sensitivity of the data, if the company is big enough and has their own AI or data science teams or engineering teams, what are the technical infrastructure details that we need to take into account when we want to bring AI into the company? So making sure that the gap between what's possible technically versus what we want is not huge and can be achieved through a reasonable length of time implementation. Then number three is, okay, as we do want, we have a customer problem that AI could solve. We have mapped what would be the sort of integration journey. Then three, how do we evolve? AI is the type of technology, unlike previous technologies, that is evolving incredibly fast, and by the time it is implemented, AI would have changed, evolved, it will have different tools, different layers, greater understanding. So how do we also take this type of uncertainty into account as we make decisions today, what tools to use, what products to integrate AI in. So three first steps because addressing these already takes quite some time and decision-making, but these are the first three steps. We're going to walk through an example of how you work with the private equity case. But I'd love to dig a little bit deeper into evolving. How do you help companies prepare for that inevitable future change? I would imagine that people are often hesitant to invest in something if they know it's going to change. That seems logical. So knowing that AI is going to be more powerful, the potential benefits are going to look different in the future than they do today. How do you help organizations get comfortable with making those investments? Now there are a few ways. First of all, I start with having everybody really just play with the tools. Interacting with Chad GPT or Claude or Gemini is so easy. Just asking questions, not really having to do anything more technical or more involved. Just having that interaction and kind of having that direct experience is a way of breaking some barriers. Then ideally people would go through technical workshops, especially non-technical leaders, and a lot of executives are nontechnical because they're they're they have a business sense, and even if they are technical, still this sophisticated technology is not easy to grasp across all the different angles. So going through a technical workshop where you can actually see a little bit deeper what AI is and what what it does. Just the standard sort of pattern recognition framework. For example, when when you classify Google photos, that was an earlier form of what we see today being Gen AI that just creates photos from a text prompted. But the ancestors of that were just being able to classify photos given specific categories. So really getting through that journey because AI didn't appear overnight. So rounding the answer, basically starting with technical workshop and being able to get a little more tangible sense of what the technology is and then really driving through prototypes. The easiest way to get over the fear, and I actually I do this a lot in my personal life. Whenever I'm afraid of something, I tend to pick up a hobby that helps me conquer that fear. So I bring that into my professional life as well. Just small prototypes. Definitely when the company has a very tiny technical team or just one data scientist, they will be over the moon thrilled to build a prototype for their business leaders to showcase what AI could do for their products or services. That's sort of the the key to success. I've seen it work multiple times, and because it speaks directly to what that organization does and how their customers might benefit directly from having AI implemented, just then working through such a small experimental prototype helps you get over that fear of not really understanding what the technology is and then yes, being able to say we do take the risk of whatever we implement today might change in 6 months and kind of starting to develop what is called, and a lot of technical leaders know this, modular implementation. So you don't build a full system rigid as an architecture, but you build an architecture of components. So as technology evolves for one component, you don't have to change the full system. You just change that particular component and you evolve the technology of that component and then the system evolves with it, and that's how you build for things that are changing, and technology is always changing. Yeah. You mentioned step one was identifying a problem, a customer problem or a business problem. What are some signs that a business is investing in AI without clear like strategic alignment? Yeah, that is unfortunately quite often visible, and very often what I see that misalignment appearing is when the business leaders are very strong in wanting to have AI because they read about it somewhere or they listen to a podcast that talked about the coolest latest AI tool that they want to implement. Basically what I do in such situations is taking that step back of okay, if we do know what the customer problem is, if we don't, it's easy, we start with defining or the top three challenges that they would want to solve in order for bringing further revenue growth, but if if they do have that already mapped and then there's still the gap to okay, what's the technical leader saying, what's the business leader saying, I just come in and create that road map for them and I say, okay, you want to solve this and this is what your technical leader is saying, where we are today, here's how we grow together, and I present myself as in this is a road map, you can all change and you can decide what you want to do with it, and I take the role of being shot it at in order to help mediate what the business leader wants and what the technical leader says is is possible. You work with companies at different stages of AI maturity. How do you help leaders assess where they actually are, not where they want to be? Yeah. Um, actually from a work I did with a small midsized company a few months ago, that's where we started because that gap that I talked about earlier between where their CEO thought they were versus where their CTO said they were technically, it was very big and they just couldn't reconcile it and they couldn't really progress in in bringing AI into the organization. And from that that work led to me building this AI maturity spectrum that basically gives a few pointers of how to identify where your company sits and both from like operational readiness, team skills, overall industry sort of landscape and what to do as next steps in order to bring the organization to the next step. It's a pretty simple eight level spectrum and it starts with okay, in order to implement this type of tool, we need to have specific architecture or we need to have a customer problem to address. Do we even understand what machine learning is? Do we have any form of algorithms that do anything in the company? Do we have automated workflows? Even a small thing like sending I don't know, a set of expenses report to be approved by your manager and then be paid off by your financial department. So even simple things like this can give you the pointers of am I just AI aware because we don't really have any form of algorithms, we don't have any automation, or yes, we do have something and now our data science team has already built a prototype to do customer support through assistance, identifying these elements that I describe in in the spectrum then helps very easily, 5-minute, 10-minute conversation can broad level say, okay, we are at this point in time and we can move forward by doing x, y, and z. You also have a framework you call quantum humanism. Can you walk us through the framework and how some of the components like purpose, pattern, and partnership fit together? Yes. And thank you for bringing that up because it's basically the underlying foundation of everything I've been talking about until now. So the quantum humanism framework basically comes from being able to bridge technical sides with the human side in in a context. I do believe that everything has to exist but not overlap. So clearly delineating what humans are best at, that's setting the objectives, clearly drawing the strategic road map versus what machines excel at. And that's the technology, that's the pattern recognition, those are the algorithms. So letting AI do what's best at and humans what they're good at. And so not expecting AI to be humanlike intelligence, but really knowing that AI needs to follow parameters described or set by the objectives. And then step three is, okay, as AI provides an output, then that output is thrown back to experts and leaders to evaluate given the overall organizational context, industry context. So three pillars: purpose, where humans set the objectives of what AI should do for their business. Second, you run the algorithms with that specific set of objectives, and three, you evaluate the outputs and make decisions after that. And how does this framework influence what kinds of questions a CEO or an investor should ask about AI? It kind of goes back to what we were talking about earlier. The first pillar, the purpose or the human objectives, usually will take you down the path of what kind of customer problems we are solving. What are we, what do we want from AI? What would it bring us if we look 2, 3 years down the line as a as a bigger organization or expanding in different industries or expanding the position we currently have as a business in the industry. So those would be the the questions definitely executives would be able to address and look for answers later on through application of AI in that first pillar. In the second pillar, you get the usual questions of okay, where are we from a technical perspective? Is our architecture, where is it in terms of ability of adoption of of AI? Do we also want to have something built in house or do we bring in open source models that we fine-tune and be able to specialize them for the particular context of our business. So these type of technical questions will be asked and answered in that second pillar. And then the third pillar, that being the most important, is how do we think of that collaboration, where do we plug that human in the loop step. So we are basically able to evaluate at all times what AI is doing, how it is answering and following the objectives that we set, what kind of iterative decisions we might want to do as we maybe alter objectives as we see the output from from the algorithms. I'd love to walk through an example of how this all comes together. You shared with me work that you've done with a private equity firm who is focused on making an acquisition in the healthcare technology space. Tell us about that engagement. Where did it start? What did they come to you with, and then let's walk through how you helped them avoid making a large mistake. Yeah. This, so normally the way I work with VCs and private equity firms is I come in as they ask me to do a technical due diligence on one of their portfolio companies or they are looking to acquire or invest into a new company and they're not really certain that the technical description that they received is very solid or they feel that something might be hidden or not clearly explained. And of course, as they are going to throw serious money at something, they want to make sure that that they understand all the angles. This particular case is a lot more just day-to-day life than than normal. It started with one of my collaborators at the private equity firm that was completely shocked by how much they had to still pay after having a medical procedure done. And investigating that, they actually discovered that the codes that were written by the medical staff after the procedure they had done were the wrong ones and then the insurance company just reimbursed according to the codes they received. Didn't know what the procedure really was because insurance companies, they read the codes and reimburse accordingly. So in the full sort of healthcare sort of financial universe, which is called revenue cycle management, there's a number of companies that work at different steps in this whole workflow. That starts from patient registration all the way to insurance verification all the way to you as the patient receiving\n\n\nUh, money from the insurance or having the insurance pay the claim, or you having to pay whatever it's owed. And, uh, because the length of this workflow is so huge, it covers this, uh, very many steps. A lot of errors appear, either medical billing or, in this case, the medical codes were wrong. And, um, various startups looking to bring AI into the healthcare system are targeting this particular area of the medical codes because this is currently still being done almost always by humans, and it can lead to a lot of errors just because people are overwhelmed or systems are still legacy environments, and things are not working the way they should. So, this is an opportunity where higher automation can actually benefit all the players in that entire financial workflow. And in this particular case, the, uh, person of the private equity firm, because they were particularly annoyed by the issue they were exposed to, individually looked for investing into a company that actually helps solve this problem.\n\nAnd as they found this kind of small to midsize healthcare technology company, everything looked really good in their marketing materials because they did present something called autonomous coding reading. So, being able to really automatically, just through algorithms, interpret all these medical codes without much human supervision. And that seemed really too good to be true. And that's when they brought me in to see, is this really working as automatically and autonomously as they are saying, or are there some hidden details that we should be aware of? And that's how I started the engagement with, uh, before the technical due diligence on this particular healthcare technology company, and I did follow my Quantum Humanism Framework. So, I started with the purpose side. So, again, what are the customer problems that the company was solving? So, being able to alleviate the rather large human effort in transferring these codes from the medical side to the insurance company side, and, um, as they have a product for doing that, is their revenue as a business fully linked to this product? How much of this product is truly autonomous? So, truly driven by AI, or how much of it is actually still requiring the good old traditional human intervention? So, really being able to understand how much of the revenue that the company was bringing in, how much of that was created directly by AI, and were there healthcare clients utilizing this feature of autonomous coding, or, uh, not? Is then that means that AI was not necessarily driving the mode of the, uh, of the company, just the overall, uh, product? So, that was the first part.\n\nDuring the engagement and during the work that I did, I actually discovered that autonomous coding was not really as autonomous as they were claiming in the original sort of valuation technical, uh, documentation, but it still required quite a lot of human review. And, um, that, how do you, sorry, how do you discover that out of curiosity? How did you find out that what they had, uh, promoted was not actually what was happening? Yeah, it was actually quite, uh, quite a lot of, uh, heavy conversation because they were not very willing to share how it actually works, uh, what are the sort of true system architectures and technical implementations because, of course, they were claiming competitive sensitive, and they didn't want to share all that. But they were also mentioning that it's a feedback loop as AI interprets all these codes automatically. There's still a human in the loop that puts a stamp. Initially, they were saying, okay, this is randomly done, like a regular sort of quality control process. But as I actually got to speak to one of their engineers, um, and this was part of the sort of third step of the quantum, uh, humanism framework. As I got to talk to one of their engineer, one of their AI engineers, I discovered that, in fact, everything had to pass through a human review because the more complex coding interpretation situations, those were not, in fact, handled autonomously. It was still somebody really writing down what the, uh, what the code was, particularly when more complex procedures were conducted. Basically, this type of complex cases that would have benefited a lot more from having the tool automatically doing it, in fact, were still run through humans. The differentiation between what's a complex case that needs to be fully done by humans versus something that can be partially automated was done by just running an algorithm that this particular engineer was in charge of. And he was just one person. So, if he went on holiday, the system didn't necessarily work, which was a huge, huge risk because one person dependency when you claim full autonomous system is just, they, of course, are not equal. So, that's basically how, uh, I uncovered what's the difference between what they were claiming versus how it actually worked in practice. And what did that mean for the investors? Did they ultimately pay less for this company? Did they, did they walk away from the company? How did they use what you'd found? So, they initially, they, of course, wanted to walk away from it because this, this gap between the claims versus how it actually worked in practice was, was pretty big. At the same time, when we fully assessed the technical debt, the architecture, and what their, um, data science team was working towards. So, really building more complex algorithms that can, once ready, do this autonomously, uh, or automatically. That sort of roadmap brought back the confidence that the private equity firm had that the company is valuable. But the most, the strongest argument was the proprietary data that they had from their clients because they did have a pretty steady, reliable client base that had implemented this the system that they had. And that data, that is definitely the type of advantage and mode that is hard to replicate by somebody that just comes into, uh, to the field today, even if they do have the tooling that, uh, data set actually fine-tunes and personalizes the model to really respond and give the correct output. So, that was a very strong argument, plus the roadmap of how they were going to improve things, brought in the end this turned into a deal, but the value of the deal was significantly reduced. Gotcha. Um, that's a great example of how you can use your frameworks to uncover, cover, rather, but also avoid risk. I'd love to, um, as we come to the end of our conversation, ask you some questions that hopefully can inform how people pursue their own AI, uh, initiatives. And I guess the first would be, what's one question that every CEO should ask before approving an AI project? Should be, show me the proof, because very often they get to see the flashy demo. So, something that works in a very well-defined environment, and when you take that and you put it into real-life production-ready scale, very often it falls apart. So, being able to get to that level of, let's do a trial, let's see how this works for my particular case, because another thing that a lot of AI tools are doing today, they try to sell this one-size-fits-all type of tools, which, yeah, it's hard to really have function easily because the data is very different. Each organization would have a very different architecture, and when looking at the data infrastructure, that very often cancels the idea of one-size-fits-all. So, number one, show me the proof of how will this work for my particular case, and, um, that can either lead to a success and things can move forward, or it can be a clear no, this is not going to happen, we move on.\n\nWhat's the biggest misconception you see about AI in either pitch decks or in boardrooms? Just one misconception. I would say this idea of AI is human-like intelligence. Definitely disappears in the boardroom. And that also creates that gap between where business leaders think they are versus where the technical leaders say they are because we interact with ChatGPT. We write a question, in a split second, we get an answer back. And a lot of business leaders think that is how AI should work in practice. You bring the tool, half an hour later, it needs to be working, and it needs to do what everybody said it would do, which is it's not reality. So, that misconception of expectations versus reality, maybe not misconception, but rather a gap. That's that's the biggest one. And the fact that there's so much confusion, so much hype, even I read daily about a number of tools that will magically solve whatever technical problems I have. That's not possible. So, really taking that step of saying, okay, how real is this? That will be addressing that misconception that is not human intelligence yet. You said that the real question isn't what if machines become more powerful, but what if humans become more powerful. What does that mean for how leaders should think about AI? Yes, I'm a huge believer, and again, that's what I try to promote through the Quantum Humanism Framework, that AI is not here to replace human judgment. It is here to enhance it, and we all become better by bringing technology to do what technology is good at. If you want things automated, technology can do that. If you need to have a collaborator that you ideate with, and you need that collaborator to really be a clone of yours, but not really a clone of yours, to give you different ideas, you can use the technology for it. If you want to quickly prototype something just because you want to test an idea, and your team is really busy delivering actual project and implementations, go do that with the technology. So, I see AI as coming as a tool, a very powerful tool that we should also train ourselves in using, and not just take whatever it says as that's exactly what it is, and use it for, um, our purposes to become better, to learn more, to be more efficient.\n\nAwesome.
