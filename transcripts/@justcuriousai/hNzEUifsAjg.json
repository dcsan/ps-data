  "cleanText": "This specific customer.\nJust to give a little bit of a background, wind power plant operating operator companies usually mostly deal with field maintenance, and the uptime is really a key factor of quality and the business efficiency of this operator because their core responsibility is to make sure that the uptime is as high as possible.\nSo there are not any productivity losses in the electricity generation.\nSo we started looking at how we can prevent downtimes and also how we can optimize the repair and how we can basically shorten the time of repair, which essentially later leads also to lower downtimes and preventing the downtimes.\nBut it always starts with understanding the repair process, how long it takes, and why there are some anomalies that happens in some cases that some of the turbines are nonoperating for weeks.\nSo we started looking into these examples, and we're trying to figure out how we can make this repair, field maintenance, and repair process much more efficient and collect some data in the process to do some predictive maintenance exercise and help to identify some incidents up front.\nSo they came to you with the desire to reduce downtime, and that's a function really of, I guess, properly identifying when projects need to be or these turbines need to be repaired and then repairing as efficiently as process as possible.\nWhat was the first step you took?\nIt sounds like you were given a bunch of data.\nWhat did you do with that data?\nYeah.\nSo, we started looking at field maintenance reports, and funnily enough, we discovered that these reports are also lacking some significant details.\nSo, we started basically investigating because as you said, like the the first thought was that we can start with the data science work pretty much immediately and build predictive analysis models based data that we have from maintenance reports.\nBut as I said, we had to first increase the quality of the maintenance reports.\nTherefore, we started looking into the maintenance process itself and started collecting some of the data points from how the report, how the repair is actually done, how long it takes, and that's when we discovered that we can actually help unlock some efficiency in the repair or maintenance process itself and also automate the reporting.\nSo we started with that as a first step actually.\nAnd what did you see in terms of the repair process that was inefficient?\nSo one example was that even though they were receiving some data points from the turbines because as you know, these are a lot of the times IoT devices.\nSo you get data data points from vibrations and other and and different error codes.\nSo, what we discovered is that a lot of the times when the field maintenance worker comes to a turbine, they don't have a part they need to be able to fix the turbine.\nSo there is a lot of back and forth, even though they have this part available at the warehouse, they you know, need to order it or they need to pick it up, and then the downtime of the turbine that could be, let's say, couple of hours becomes couple of days or you know, multiples multiple times what it could be.\nSo we started looking at, let's say, this example as well and also discovered that most of the time technician or field maintenance workers spend researching the manuals because those also you have multiple types of turbines.\nYou need to be able to interact with quite a lot of manuals as as a technician.\nSo that can take a couple of hours to just figure out what the specific error code means or combination of error code means or different light combination so on and so forth.\nSo just being able to efficiently research the manuals can let's say shrink the shrink the actual maintenance work by 30% right, the time spent on site by 30%.\nSo, two problems.\nOne is that they don't have the parts often that they need, and so they have to go back and get them, and that creates time that's not downtime.\nAnd then the second part is that there are different turbines, and so they need to kind of look at the manual to better understand how they're going to go about fixing it ahead of time.\nCan you walk through with each of those problems kind of how you solved it?\nHow do you get the right part in someone's hand when they go to a turbine?\nYeah.\nSo, we started consuming basically all the data points available from these IoT devices that and different sensor available and connected to those specific parts.\nWe've been able to basically build very simple vector search to be able to just pair up and suggest the the likelihood and of necessary parts that needs that are required for for the proper repair.\nSo as you can imagine, we were consuming all these data and then researching the also manuals but but just completely automatically without human intervention to suggest the parts before the repair.\nSo we we were able to pre-diagnose automatically using a combination of LLM and vector search to search different service manuals and pair those up with the data that we are getting from the turbine to suggest the parts that are necessary for this repair, and therefore the technician still could make a decision before before being dispatched, but had the list of most likely parts needed for the repair available within the app.\nAnd then the second problem of having to review the manual of the specific turbine.\nWhat did you do there?\nSo I already I already mentioned the app that was responsible for suggesting the specific parts.\nSo into this app we also integrated an experience of materials and manual search on top of which was a conversational model.\nSo you could basically in a natural language describe what's happening on site, what different factors and problems you are observing, and based of that model expanded your question or or or problem that you described into search query and pulled out the specific relevant information for the repair into this conversation.\nSo the technician could just review the synthesis of of the manual and then basically just dive into the specific part of the manual that was the most relevant and making sure that he's able to review the full context of of the manual as well.\nBut just pointing this person to the right direction saved a lot of time in the process.\nAnd that was happening through conversational interface as you are used to from.\nAnd so if you combine those two solutions, what did the kind of before and after look like in terms of the amount of time or downtime that was occurring versus after you deployed these solutions?\nYeah.\nSo we are mostly measuring maintenance time reduction.\nSo in terms of maintenance time reduction, you are able to fairly quickly in the first quarter get to higher single digits of time saved, and that translates to higher hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for like average sized power plant.\nJust curious and sharing more about you and Sudolabs and your work and helping small and medium-sized enterprises transform their businesses with AI.\nThank you.\nThank you so much, too.\n",
