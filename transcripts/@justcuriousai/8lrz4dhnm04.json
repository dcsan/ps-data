  "cleanText": "Today I'm just curious.\nI'm joined by Michael Domanic, Head of Generative AI Business Strategy at UserTesting, the world's leading on-demand human insights platform.\nMichael leads the company's internal AI transformation program, embedding AI into workflows across every function.\nHe spent years building conversational AI and now focuses on making generative AI not just practical but measurable.\nToday we'll explore how he's doing that and what others can learn from his hands-on experience leading change at scale.\nMichael, welcome to Just Curious.\nThanks D.\nIt's great to be here.\nYou've worked across customer experience strategy and now AI transformation.\nTell us a little bit about that journey that brought you to leading AI transformation at UserTesting.\nYeah.\nSo I mean the journey actually starts before I was actually at UserTesting.\nI used to be a customer of UserTesting.\nSo, during chatbot pipe cycle 1.0, which is what I call it.\nSo that's takes us to the period of like 2016 to 2019, 2020.\nUm, I was designing a lot of conversational interface experiences.\nUm, in that era, every brand wanted a Facebook messenger chatbot.\nUm, or later that became Slack bots, Skype bots.\nThe backdrop to all of that was conversational interface was proliferating in homes across America via Alexa and Google Assistant and Google Home.\nSo I actually used to work um with companies designing those experiences and used to test it at UserTesting.\nJoined UserTesting, have had a lot of different roles in the organization.\nAnd in November of 2022 when OpenAI launched, you know, Transformer 3.5, like that felt to me like we were kind of going back to that moment that I was in before UserTesting, albeit with much better technology.\nSo, it just really felt like the time for our company to wrap our arms around this, embrace it.\nI had a lot of support from leadership to really push that mission forward.\nCan you tell us a little bit more about UserTesting and why is AI so important to the future of the business?\nYeah, so UserTesting is a platform that our customers use to create great experiences for their customers, right?\nSo a lot of times our platform is getting used by designers, by UX researchers, but also by folks from marketing that want to test, you know, their marketing campaigns, copy, images, you know, all that stuff.\nUm, and you know, I think when it comes to AI at UserTesting, there's two really important ways that we use AI here.\nSo, one is the mission that I'm attached to, which is to transform our organization, transform the way that we work by embracing AI capabilities.\nAnd the second way that we really use AI is in our product, right?\nSo like we're designing a lot of features within our product that make it easier for our customers to use our product, enhance the value that they get from our product by leveraging AI capabilities.\nThe thing that I'm mostly focused on is the internal transformation thing.\nThat's is that's super important for UserTesting and I think it's important for any company with a focus on knowledge work because we know how much the current AI capabilities can enhance the work that you're doing, create amazing efficiencies, help you create work faster and really increase the strategy.\nSo we know that's a possibility UserTesting.\nSo we're really again wrapping our arms around this and embracing those capabilities.\nMany companies struggle to move past curiosity into implementation.\nWhat were the first time?\nWhat were the first signs rather at UserTesting that it was time to invest in a true AI transformation effort?\nYeah, it's a great question.\nYou know, I mentioned those two missions that we have to embrace AI and UserTesting.\nOne in our product and you know, one to transform the organization.\nI think for us early on, we initially set out to integrate AI into our product.\nWe had already been doing this right even before the generative AI boom.\nWe've been building machine learning homegrown machine learning models since 2019 and putting that in our product.\nSo again it just felt very natural to us when this you know these generative AI capabilities uh became available to businesses to build upon that felt very natural.\nNow the internal stuff we had had a lot of conversations for probably a period of about six to maybe 10 months call it we had a lot of internal conversations but like most organizations we were trying to figure out how does this integrate right like how do how do we actually use this to augment what we're doing.\nUm, I think in those early days for me it was kind of crucial to focus in on a specific use case and um the use case that I focused on non on is a problem that we dealt with and pretty much every other company deals with and that's the problem of information fragmentation.\nSo we have all of this information um that gets disseminated across the organization and it's in a lot of different places.\nYou know our sales team uses Highspot, the rest of the company uses Confluence.\nThere's other repositories of knowledge.\nI did an internal study that looked at the cost of the problem and we were just losing way too much time because people were just hunting through all of the different resources, you know, knowledge repositories that we have to find answers to simple questions.\nSo actually what I did was in those early days is created a custom GPT that pulled all those knowledge resources together and did another study that showed how much of an improvement that was.\nAnd it was really clear to us at that time that we were saving a ton of time in you know folks trying to find answers to questions.\nWe were also increasing the access to knowledge for folks.\nSo in those early days that study that experiment that we did made it really clear what the possibility was throughout the rest of the organization.\nWhat internal challenges do you face early on either culturally or operationally and how did you start to overcome them?\nYeah, I I think we kind of face both challenges, both cultural and operational.\nI think the the cultural stuff is probably stuff that like every organization was dealing with, continues to deal with.\nI think a lot of that has to do with people's trepidation about this, you know, proliferation of AI.\nI make it really clear to our organization that I think the genie is out of the bottle when it like that genie is not going back in.\nI think we're all going to get face this transformation sooner or later, probably sooner than later.\nAnd I think it's the responsibility of any employer that considers themselves a good employer to really uh lead their organization through this transformation, provide them with the tools, the training um then enablement to be able to take that that transformation on.\nI think that's a really important part of our mission and again this is something I talk to our organization about quite often.\nI think operational challenges like this is a we're asking people to change a lot of their behavior, right?\nI think that's what successful transformation looks like when it comes to AI and that's a hard thing to do.\nChanging changing behavior is a really hard thing to do for us.\nOnce we decided that we were going to make investments here, we chose to use enterprise chatbt as our center of gravity general purpose solution.\nUh we were deliberate about who we rolled that out to in the early days.\nSo it wasn't full enterprise at that time.\nWe handpicked individuals who we knew were going to be our early adopters who were going to talk about the interesting things that they were doing and that like to be a pretty good strategy for us because it created a little bit of virality.\nUm it created a little bit of FOMO for the individuals who didn't have access.\nThey were like you know why does this person get access to this transformational tool and I don't right.\nSo that that kind of helped us um really like make this thing a little bit viral within the company.\nUm, a few months later we went, you know, wall-to-wall enterprise.\nThat was in the summer of 2024.\nAnd by that point, you know, a lot of that interest had been built up in the organization.\nSo from an operational standpoint, you know, a couple months into our deployment, people a lot of people in the organization felt like they were ready to start experimenting.\nYeah.\nAnd when you picked those early adopters, did you reach out to people you thought had the potential to be kind of early testers?\nDid you did you pick a certain number of people within each business or functional unit?\nWhat what did that look like?\nYeah, I think there were a couple things.\nSo, one is that this conversation had already been playing out in pockets of the organization.\nSo we were aware of where that conversation was happening, who the players were that were involved in that conversation.\nYou know, the these were individuals who conveyed a specific like specific interest in in doing this.\nSo that was kind of like one way that we identified who those early adopters were.\nAnother way is very early on in our chat GPT deployment, we were invited to OpenAI to do a hackathon, a GPT hackathon.\nAnd then again like we kind of handpicked a larger set of individuals to participate in that.\nAnd again like that showed us who was really leaning in, who who was really interested in experimenting.\nSo that was another kind of wave of early adopters.\nAnd then from that point some you know awareness had kind of spread in the organization some virality had spread through the organization and a lot of other people were saying like hey like I've been reading a lot about this I have my own personal account maybe I've been using it for work maybe I haven't not going to tell you right but I would love to use it for work and uh you know again that was like another maybe another wave of that that those early adopters and maybe by that point enough of the organization had kind of realized that people that I work with are doing really interesting things.\nI want to do those interesting things, too.\nSo, this interest kind of kept compounding over time.\nYou mentioned virality.\nWere there any things that you did to help facilitate virality and the sharing of what people were doing within the broader organization?\nYeah, we talked about this a lot in those days.\nI mean we still do but you know what we did was in lunch and learns or at all hands meetings you know anytime a large kind of cross-section of the organization was getting together we were talking about the things that the early adopters were doing some of the experiments that they were running some of the you know those early days like the GPTs that folks were creating so yeah this was something that we talked about to try to spread some of that interest and and and that virality.\nYeah.\nIn terms of how they were using it, did you shape that use at all with the early adopters?\nDid you allow them to freestyle based on how they were using it already and maybe what problems they saw it could be helpful to solving for them?\nHow did that how did that use kind of manifest itself?\nI think it was both things that you mentioned.\nYou know, we had spent a lot of time thinking about what are the really interesting ways, the meaningful ways that we could bring this into our organization.\nUm, as we identified those interesting use cases, sure, we shared that out with our early adopters and saying like, \"Hey, try this or try this.\"\nFolks were also doing a lot of experiments, right?\nThey were figuring out other interesting things to do with the tool.\nSo, there was a lot of knowledge sharing that helped other people figure out like, hey, like this person's doing this.\nI might not do that exact thing, but that gives me an idea over here.\nI think the genesis of this is really to spur on that conversation that was happening in places like a dedicated slack channel.\nAt that at that point, it was like our AI experimenters Slack channel.\nWe were getting together regularly as a group, an early adopters group to, you know, again have these conversations, talk about the interesting things that we're doing, the interesting things that we're learning, how are the models changing, how do those changes impact other things that we might be able to do.\nYeah.\nUh you mentioned that early adopters and then I guess some of the later adopters were actively experimenting.\nSomewhere building GPTs and sharing them with the organization.\nUh sounds like a very kind of bottoms up effort.\nUh was there a top-down strategy that you then layered on?\nUm and yeah, tell us a little bit more about that.\nWhen did you decide to um you know layer on a top down strategy?\nWhat did it look like and how did that play out?\nYeah, I think I think that top down strategy actually came first.\nSo in those again early days with the top down strategy, the first thing that was established here at UserTesting was an AI working group, an AI governance group where we had identified what are the possibilities with these tools, right?\nLike just a cross functional group people, leaders from around the organization having a conversation about what are the what are the possibilities here?\nWhat's the art of the possible?\nUm then that quickly turned into what are the security implications?\nWhat are the legal implications?\nDo we create an AI usage guideline?\nDo we create an internal AI manifesto about uh what do we do with the tools?\nHow do we use it?\nWhy are we doing this?\nSo yes, I mean like that is that is all stuff that was kind of happening in the very very early days I think before we even rolled out any general purpose tools.\nUm and then once we felt like we were ready to roll those tools out because we had some basic infrastructure in place um you know then then that's when we kind of went out to our early adopters and said you have access to this tool now you know you're one of our early adopters you're one of our champions you know let's figure out how how we use this.\nWhat did that initial governance look like and what was your approach to balancing innovation and experimentation with legal or ethical or security concerns?\nSo yeah and like I said the early governance was a cross functional group of people.\nSo people from legal security, uh our CEO, our CTO, leaders from product, leaders from engineering, like basically like any part of the organization that we felt like was going to get impacted by this transformation um had a seat at the table and still do like that's still a group that exists and we still meet on a very regular basis.\nIn those early days, it was super important for us to figure out what are those legal and security implications.\nSo the security implications pretty obvious, right?\nIf we're using this tool, if we're putting sensitive data, company data into this tool, is that going to show up in the response of somebody's prompt outside of our company, right?\nLike we didn't want that to get leaked.\nSo, we worked with our partners to make sure that we were operating in an environment that our data, our prompts, everything that we're doing doesn't train the model.\nThink obviously like that's really important for probably most if not all businesses.\nI think when we in those early days as well, the other thing that's really important was important for us to figure out was you know there's people across our organization that have access to all sorts of sensitive data.\nWhat data is a no\n\n\nWhat data can we not use in any AI context, and what data can we be more liberal about? UserTesting has, I would say, a relatively cautiously liberal AI governance policy. There are definitely classes of data that no one can ever use in a context of AI, and a lot of that is our customer data. So, earlier, I talked about how our customers use UserTesting. They capture feedback on, you know, what it's essentially what it's like to be their customer. Maybe they're designing a new mobile application, and they have a Figma prototype. They're getting feedback on that Figma prototype via our platform. They own all of that, right? Like our customers own all of that data. Very few people in the organization would even have access to that data. And for those that do, they know, and I remind them about this every single day: no customer data could ever be used in an AI context. Unless that's in our product, unless we have agreements, you know, with our customers, they invoke it, right? Like that's something separate. But when you're using LLMs on a day-to-day basis, you're just never going to use that data. There are other like classes of data as well, like PII, obviously, like you don't want to use that. Don't put your credit card in, right? Like don't put employee names and addresses, like stuff like that. But I think every organization needs to figure out what their data strategy is and make sure that that gets clearly and regularly communicated throughout the company, right? You mentioned the building of custom GPTs. I guess a first step is identifying a use case or a problem to solve. What do you look for when you are looking for a good use case for AI?\n\nThat is a great question. So that's not always me making that decision. We have fully democratized the building of custom GPTs throughout the organization. You know, we talk about this a lot in the company. We create GPTs that are, you know, intended to be used by essentially everyone in the company. And everyone in the company has the ability to create them. They don't need to come to me and say, like, hey, like I want to do this thing with custom GPTs. Is it okay if I do this? Right? As long as it fits into, you know, our governance policies, like that's totally fine. Like create a custom GPT. I think like the larger question might be what are custom GPTs good at and like what should companies be thinking about using them for? I think like GPTs are really great at any kind of repetitive workflow that you might be doing. I'll give you an example. Like I have a GPT that analyzes our usage and adoption for all of our AI tools, right? I get that from the vendor. It's often like a massive data dump that they give to me that I have to like sift through, but I've created a custom GPT that analyzes all of that, spits out reports. I send those reports to leaders in the organization. They can see what their teams are doing, right? Like that's a great use case for a GPT. Um, and that's just it's just me using that GPT. Yeah, other use cases for GPTs that are, you know, used across our organization is we have one that creates OKRs for everyone in the company. Um, you know, I don't want anyone in our company to have to spend the time to write really great OKRs. Like, you shouldn't have to be good at writing OKRs. That's a distraction from the thing that you're hired at. Like, if you're a salesperson, you're hired because you're a great salesperson, not because you're great at writing OKRs, right? I want you to have great OKRs. Like I want you to have like a really awesome road map that matters to the larger goals of the organization, but you certainly don't need to be good at creating them, and that's what that GPT does, right? That GPT is trained on here are the large goals of the organization, here's our executive goals, senior leadership team, you know, middle management, and then individual contributors. So wherever you sit in the organization, the GPT already knows what are the goals for essentially everyone above you in this company. Tell us what you're working on. Okay, here's a great set of OKRs for you. You could also bring OKRs that you've written and ask the GPT to refine them for you. Like these are specific examples, but every company has maybe hundreds if not thousands of potential use cases for these custom GPTs, custom solutions, and it really, it really just reverse engineers to where you can make the most impact. Yeah. Are there problems or use cases that require a custom solution where a GPT is just not, I guess, good enough, and you need to build custom software, and how do you make that decision?\n\nSo yeah, I mean, like this conversation is really focused on custom GPTs, but like one thing that we have had a little bit of a struggle with is when you're training a custom GPT, you're training it on external data, right? You're training it on data that OpenAI just doesn't have access to today through their general purpose models. That's the benefit of a custom GPT. Two ways to train a custom GPT. One is through static knowledge documents that you, you know, create a PDF, put it in the GPT, tell the GPT, you know, here's what's in, here's what's in this document. Here's when you're going to use and reference this document. Another way is by creating an API connection, establishing an API connection into a third-party source via the actions feature in GPTs. So, we've done a lot of that. Like, we've done a lot of experimentation with that. Actions feature doesn't always work as well as advertised. Sometimes we're blowing through context window limitations in the GPTs, which are much smaller than if you're building on the OpenAI API. Sometimes APIs are just not structured in a way that's useful for the GPT. So yeah, like there, those are when, when I kind of like maybe simplify this by saying if you want a dynamic data pull most of the time, not all of the time, like sometimes the GPTs are good at this, but most of the time you might need some kind of like more robust custom solution outside of a GPT. Maybe at that point you're developing on top of one of the APIs, the frontier APIs. Gotcha. Um, how do you make sure the work that you and your organization are doing has a measurable business impact? How, how do you talk about the ROI of this transformation? Yeah, I think ROI is actually pretty important. Um, there are other characters like me, you know, running like AI programs that say, like, you know, I need to measure ROI because it's obvious, like everyone's going to get like massive return on this. I think, I think it's actually important to measure ROI for two reasons. One, at least two reasons. One is we want to be able to tell our executives, you know, and our boards, this is, you know, we're spending all this money, and this is the return that we're getting out of this, right? So, I think there's just like fiscal, some fiscal responsibility and and making sure that you're making good investments. I think the second reason is in going through that exercise, you can actually start to prioritize which projects are we getting the most value out of, maybe double down on those projects, or maybe you create projects like that in another part of the business to continue to get high return on investment. So how do we do that at UserTesting? I think it depends on the project, and a lot of times this is actually connected to custom GPTs, but there are certainly some of these projects, some of these custom GPTs, we will look at the before and after state. So the before state is it took us this long to do this thing. This is the level of quality. This is the level of rigor. Um, you know, for example, you might be creating a GPT to augment marketing campaigns. You're not only making those marketing campaigns better, but you could probably do more of them because you're instilling a lot of efficiency in the process. So we've done that as well, right? So like there's a before and after state. The before state is this is what that looks like in the business today. The after state is now we're creating marketing campaigns where we're getting better returns on, and we can do more of these. We know what the average value is per campaign. So if we can increase that by 30%, you know, then we have a pretty good calculation of what that return is. Um, so this is these are kind of like the, this is kind of like the modeling that we do for a lot of the projects that we work on here at UserTesting. Yeah. Uh, we talked about how you've been enabling AI adoption across the organization. Are there particular business units or functional units where the use cases are more prevalent or impactful or have the biggest ROI?\n\nI think yeah, there's probably two areas of the business that are most meaningful to us right now. I would say this, like I think the caveat here is like there's probably no part of our business that doesn't get massive return by doing this stuff, right? But I think the two areas of our business where we probably get, it feels like the lowest hanging fruit on return on investment is one, sales, right? Go to market, we want to be able to sell, you know, more software, retain more customers, and there's a lot of opportunities for us to bring AI into the process to help us do that, right? So that's an obvious one. I think the second one is how do we use AI tools to increase rigor and efficiency when we're writing code? We're a software company, right? So, we're building a technical product. And the more we can enhance that process, the more product that we can ship, the better our products become. Like probably for most SaaS businesses, like those are that that that's like the the low-hanging fruit. Yeah. Uh, can we talk a little bit about efficiency? For a lot of people, efficiency is code for fewer people in the future. How do you think about efficiency and AI and the future of workforce?\n\nYeah. So, I think this is probably going to look different for every company. I can tell you how we look at it here at UserTesting is certainly by integrating AI capabilities into, you know, your workflows and your process of conducting work, you create greater efficiencies, right? You could save yourself, maybe it's 12 hours a week, maybe it's 3 days a week, whatever that is. So then the question becomes is what do you replace with that time? Are you reducing headcount and just doing the same level of work with less people? That's not that interesting to us. I think we're far more interested in doing more with more, right? So, like, okay, everybody saves 12 hours of their week. Now, we can focus on other areas of the business, other challenges. You know, we're just better positioned to create a better company by being able to do more. And I think that is by far the most interesting way that AI impacts our business is we can do more with more.\nAs we come to a close, I'd love to ask some recommendation-related questions based on your own experience. And so I guess, firstly, for leaders who are starting to embed AI in their teams today, what's the first step that you'd recommend?\n\nI think the first step is to figure out who's going to lead that effort in your organization. Um, this is not the side gig of a half a dozen people in your company. I mean, maybe, maybe if your company's a half a dozen people, maybe it is, right? But like if you've got at least maybe like two, 300 people in your company, you want to appoint somebody that this is going to be their dedicated mission. Um, and that person, uh, I talked about this a lot, like that person has four key characteristics. One is they're fluent in AI tools. That seems like an obvious one, right? Like you want to somebody that's going to understand what the capabilities are and make sure we understand how those capabilities connect to the business. I think the second thing is this person knows enough about the business that they kind of understand how it all comes together, right? You're not an expert in HR, but you understand what HR does. You're not an expert in marketing, but you know what marketing does, right? So, a person that understands and knows enough to be dangerous around all functions of the business. The third, relatively obvious one, they know how to get stuff done, right? Like anytime we ask somebody to lead something, something important, they should be someone that knows how to get stuff done. The fourth characteristic, I think, is the least obvious and most important, and these are deeply creative individuals. The reason why that's important is because we've never deployed a technology like generative AI in our businesses before, right? It's it's a pretty abstract technology. It is not like deploying a CRM like Salesforce, right? When you're deploying Salesforce, you're going to teach your users to push that button, pull that lever, get that output, that output every time. Every time you push that button, you're going to get that output. With generative AI, it's very different. It's very abstract, and you need someone that's going to be able to think creatively about how to translate that abstract layer into something that feels real and tangible for people across the company. Does that create, that creativity suggest they come from a particular part of the organization, or are there ways to, I don't know, evaluate the creativity of a, I'm just picking some random business units, a finance person, HR person, I don't know, is, is the answer to that question, like, I'm not really sure? I, I can tell you this, um, yeah, like it could be a finance person, sure, like it could be the CTO, it could be, uh, it could be anyone in the company. Uh, I don't think that the AI transformation lead comes from any one specific discipline. Like there are creative individuals across all different roles in a company. And by the way, in business, we have a term for this creativity in business. Typically, we call them entrepreneurs. Like entrepreneurs is really a different way of saying someone that thinks really creatively about business application. And usually they think so creatively about it that they go and create something, right? Like they create something out of nothing. I would, yeah. Like if you're looking for who are the individuals that might possibly be really creative enough to be able to handle this, it might be people with an entrepreneurial background. Um, you know, maybe, I don't know, maybe they do like woodworking on their weekends, right? Like that's a creative activity. I don't think there's like really like a paradigm like that you can follow to say, like, okay, like if we, if we look at all these different variables, like that's going to lead us to this person. I, I think you just have to to be, be a little bit creative, right? Like be a little bit creative about who that creative person is. What's the role of the founder or CEO in a transformation like this?\n\n\nI guess founder implies like more early stage.\nI think, yeah, CEO, look at at the end of the day, your AI transformation is a top-down, bottom-up approach, and we talked about different ways that that happens.\nUh, the top neither is negotiable, right?\nYou have to have both.\nAnd I think the top-down approach, it's super important for a CEO to regularly communicate with the organization uh about why you're doing this, about how you're doing this, like how important this is to the company that we actually move through some kind of transformation and embrace this.\nThe CEO is going to set the tone.\nUm, you know, like you're asking that question, and I immediately think about the internal Shopify memo that like was pretty aggressive, right?\nLike that was a pretty aggressive memo that came from the CEO.\nAnd I think when I first read that, I um I had like a negative reaction to it, but then I like stopped and I read it again, and I thought like, actually agree with like pretty much everything that the CEO is saying.\nUm, but the tone of that memo was a little bit too harsh, right?\nSo like I think a CEO is really important to one say, here's what we're doing, here's why we're doing it, but be able to deliver that in a way that inspires the organization to follow the mission.\nHow should the CEO be using Gen AI themselves?\nAnd I'm especially interested in CEOs who are non-technical, like Toby, obviously technical, likely to be playing around with new technologies all the time, but many CEOs are are not technical.\nWhat what role should AI play for the CEO and how they do their jobs and run their business?\nYeah, I I don't I don't think technical versus nontechnical is like really relevant here.\nI think when you're talking about a CEO, that's a strategic person, right?\nThat's that's a person that is setting the strategy and the direction of the company.\nThat's that's maybe the most high-value use case for for AI.\nGenerally, in a business filled with knowledge workers, you use AI in three ways.\nYou use it as an intern, you use it as an assistant, and you use it as a thought partner.\nYou know, like the intern use cases and the assistant use cases are kind of like the lower level, but still very valuable use cases, but there is no use case that nearly touches the value of using it as a thought partner.\nWe see CEOs that are uh, you know, using AI to help prepare for their board meetings, help write their board letters, right?\nThat those are great use cases for AI.\nYou're using it as a strategic partner.\nYou're using it to say, \"Here's how I'm thinking about this specific strategy in our organization.\nWhat are my blind spots?\nWhat are the other things that I should be doing?\nUm, you know, help me understand, you know, how to think about this.\"\nIt may be an even even more strategic layer or like, \"Hey, I'm going to go in front of my board next week.\nHere's our board deck.\nWhat are what holes are they going to poke in our strategy?\nWhat questions should I be prepared for?\"\nBy the way, I think everyone in the company should be using it for those like those types of use cases.\nBut yeah, like especially a CEO, a CEO is probably not going to like use AI every day to write their emails, but they are they should be using it pretty regularly to again be a thought partner.\nLast question.\nDo you think AI adoption will become a competitive differentiator or do you think it ultimately becomes table stakes for every organization or both?\nI think it's both, and I think it's both today.\nUm, to me it feels like table stakes.\nUh, it feels like, you know, every company I think has really turned the corner on recognizing how important this is and how important it is to like really start transforming the way that we work around AI capabilities.\nUm, so yeah, like not every company has done this though, right?\nLike not every company has even taken the first steps to do this.\nAnd if you have taken steps and if you're moving your way through that transformation, I do definitely think that is a differentiator.\nAwesome.\nMichael, I really appreciate you coming by.\nJust curious and sharing your perspectives from helping UserTesting um enable a top-down and bottoms up uh AI program.\nAnd uh I wish you the best of luck.\nThanks, D.\nIt was great to chat with you.\n",
