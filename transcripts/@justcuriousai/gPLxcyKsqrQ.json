  "cleanText": "Today we're speaking with Nitesh Pant, co-founder of DevDash Labs, who helps SMB founders overcome operational bottlenecks with custom AI solutions. Nitesh, welcome to Just Curious.\n\nHappy to be here, Stu.\n\nTell me a little bit about yourself. Who is Nitesh? What led you to start focusing on helping SMBs and startups use AI to solve problems?\n\nI'm Nitesh. I'm co-founder of DevDash Labs. We're an AI research and development company. Our story starts around mid-2024. I found myself building opportunities, and this gave me time to dive deep into what was happening in AI, especially around the emerging agent intake space that most people weren't talking about back then, and I started building and releasing a few products. And what I saw was a massive gap on what I was doing and what LinkedIn was doing, or you know, what LinkedIn experts were doing, right? So then till now, it's full of people who probably haven't written a single line of code but are selling promises, impossible promises, to business owners who want real solutions. I think that's crap. So I said, you know, I have had enough of that, and I said I'm going to make an impact here. So we started focusing almost exclusively on SMBs and startups, and we started giving them, you know, research-backed custom AI solutions with measurable ROI instead of just empty promises. And then it came down to seeing a problem and getting fed up with the status quo and deciding to do something about it.\n\nAwesome. And we're going to walk through an example of one of your engagements in a few minutes. Maybe we could start with bottlenecks and problems. How can founders and leaders effectively identify which bottlenecks or problems are best suited to AI automation?\n\nUh, that's a great question. So a couple of themes stand out. First would be tasks that are taking 10, 15, it would have been 20 hours per week for a founder, and if those tasks are repeated and they have a certain process around it, right? So long tasks, very repeatable, and have a certain process around it, those are the first, what we call, easy wins of AI implementation. That's part one. And I guess the second part is what we call scaling unique value. So a lot of our clients are professional services companies that have been domain experts for the past 5, 10 years. They have built processes, they have built intellectual property knowledge bases around it, and when you're at that point, you can't just talk to chat GPT and expect it to understand the world in your viewpoint. You have to build out agents that you know, can ingest your client's data and process it and work with it from your viewpoint. So I guess those are two major themes, right? Process and stuff where, you know, your IP can be the moat.\n\nInteresting. Is there a process to identify the first bottleneck? Do you interview everyone on the team? Do you look at your calendar? Encourage you just make a note of where you're spending your time, and then you know, when it feels like you're spending a lot of time doing a replicable process, um, that sort of, that's it. How do you usually go about identifying those opportunities?\n\nSo we personally, we run workshops, AI discovery workshops that do it for you, but there's different ways to do it, right? So first is, as you said, really understanding where is it that you, you're as a founder, you're facing this bottlenecks, where is it that you're doing replicable processes, or is it that, you know, you could use automation? I like to think of it as an intern test. If you can, you know, teach an intern about two, three hours of work, and hopefully over the course of a week they get better at it, that's probably something you could spin an AI agent to do, a custom AI agent to do for you. So, um, that's one way to look about it. Uh, other way is to, you know, always start with the problem, right? Uh, instead of the, you know, what am I doing, it's what are the problems that I'm solving, and can I now you solve these problems using AI?\n\nCan we also expand on the um, the second opportunity you suggested, which is to leverage your um, IP in new and different ways using agents? What does that look like in practice? And maybe give us, I know we're going to walk through a case study, but maybe give us a short kind of example, like, and we can blind it of like what that would look like for a professional services firm.\n\nSo, you know, if and by professional services, it's um, often consulting companies, boutique companies. And you know, between consulting companies, they have frameworks that they've built out, they have processes, workflows, models, right? And one thing that's constant is that to build on these models, you need client data. That's one part of the equation. You need your IP, right? And you need a brain to process that. So your IP comes down from past projects you've worked on, some institutional knowledge you've um, developed in the while doing this project. And um, your talent pipeline that's there, like, you know, your actual consultants. Client data is client data. For AI, it has to be a little bit more structured. You can't just feed it in unstructured data. But the way you go about doing this would be, you know, building or training, as we call it, training agents that can think like a consultant, like your consultant would, given what your firm knows, right? So, you know, training from your um, you know, past cases, and I'm not, of course, training from your, if you have any specific frameworks you like to use, right? Stuff like that. And sort of using now, if you have a custom solution, you have the data, which is the context here, right? You already have the context with agent, and you can converse with it and ask it to do work for you.\n\nGot it. So these are internal tools that are allowing the consultants to do more than they could do before because they're leveraging all the experiences and knowledge of the organization over however many years it's been around.\n\nExactly. Yes. So what we've found is that the limiting factor is how much hours can someone work for a client project, right? So suppose like there's x,000 per client project, and there's only so much hour you can work put into it. So you're now limited by uh, your revenue is somewhat limited by the maximum number of hours in a year you can work, right? But now uh, with AI, what you can do is the client site, client project size might not decrease, but the hours it takes you to do a work increase decreases because your productivity has increased. So now you can actually increase your revenue because you can get more work done in the frame.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Uh, that's always like when people talk about efficiency and doing, doing the same amount with less, I guess is sort of like where people's heads immediately go. But if you are a business that has opportunity in front of you, you should be able to do more with the same percent. Why not?\n\nYeah. Um, there's a lot going on in AI, and I imagine it can be overwhelming for founders and leaders. What sort of practical advice do you give them when they come to you and say they're just overwhelmed with all the different options?\n\nMy first practical advice is experiment yourself. Don't trust the hype, right? So, if you haven't already, and you're, you should at this point, use chat GPT, use cloud, use gymnast, use your favorite chatbot. Try to come up with workflows. So, these could be small custom GPTs that help you get work done faster. So, that's one way to experiment. Second would be not to fall for the hype that used around LinkedIn. So that you might see a lot of like very specialized um, custom workflows, custom agents built. Um, there's a huge chance that that is still custom that it probably won't work for your use case, right? Work start from the problem, not not the solution. That's that's our motto. Uh, that's what we believe in.\n\nGotcha. When you're building a custom solution for one of your clients, how do you ensure that it handles real world complexities and the edge cases that tend to emerge?\n\nThat's a great question. The solution to that is a lot of testing and a lot of evaluations, right? So there is the part where you build it well. So good prompt engineering, good rack pipelines, good agent building, um, good methods, good infrastructure, that's that's good. But the real moat as we've seen it comes down to how much you have evaluated LM outputs and given those evalu agents. So the quick answer to that is rigorous testing.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And maybe you could share a little bit more about your process for both like rapidly deploying but also iteratively improving the custom solutions that you're building for SMBs. What does that process look like? You mentioned a discovery workshop as maybe one of the first steps. Walk us through what that process looks like.\n\nYeah. So we run AI discovery workshops where there's three different phases to it. First is the education part. The second is the identification part, and then there's the implementation strategy part. So we start with a quick one, AI, and a new strategic way of um, thinking about AI implementation. We've developed some frameworks around it, you know, and those are to identify quick wins, strategic transformations, or efficiency gains, um, depending on what the use case is. And then we, after we know we've done a quick one-on-one, we go um, and do a couple of items. So this could be this is like problem solving, but um, very specific for for AI. So, you know, it could be as simple as like listing out all your problems, all your pain points you have, or um, doing a a day in the walk, day in the life of a CEO or right in the life of a CEO type exercise, and then using what we have learned and thinking, okay, what are good opportunities that could be where where AI could be a good fit, right? Taking two or three of those and then doing an exercise where you're really drilling down the problem, because oftentimes the problem that you get in the first point, the pain point, right? It's a symptom of the real underlying problem, but not, and then once you have drilled down that problem, and then you ask, you ask, okay, what is the optimal way to solve it? And surprisingly, many times it might not involve AI, and that's completely fine. Many times it might not even involve technology, and that's fine, right? It's really solving those problems. And if there's a case that there is tech involved, now the question is, can you use AI or not? Right? And now if the answer is yes, and then the next answer is, would you use something that's custom or would you use an off-the-shelf product? Again, this is why it's very important to start from the problem, not the solution, because not every problem needs a custom AI solution. That is not.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. I want to um, I want to dig a little bit deeper into that problem reframing because I think it's something I've thought a lot about. I was an EIR at an incubator before starting this in another business, and a big part of our process was also like ensuring that you were solving the right problem by reframing the problem multiple times until you really kind of like landed on that like true problem that could be solved. Do you have a, is there a process that you go through to kind of find that true problem? Like someone comes to you and says, \"Hey, here's the problem we have. What do you do next?\"\n\nYou ask why a lot. So like X is like a, at least like five times you can draw out a process map. So you know why in this entire problem that you see, what's the input that's happening, the process, the output, and then on each of that those process maps you can ask more questions. But but it comes down to really asking the right questions given the context of the talk we're having.\n\nYeah. Let's walk through the case study that we were discussing earlier. You worked on behalf of an Eyewear Company client to help them improve and automate the prescription verification process. Tell me a little bit about that. I mean, I would love to start at the beginning. You know, what problem did they come to you with and where'd you go from there?\n\nSo they came to us to do an AI discovery workshop. We did talked for about 2 hours, and we realized that there were a lot of places where um, they could use AI, but also save up time, right? And this was a case of classic founder-driven company where the founder is now stretched to their limit, and um, they just simply don't have more hours in a day to put to do the real high value work, right? And then, you know, it was like a lot of marketing effort that was taking time, customer support that was taking time, and also prescription that was this prescription verification that was second time. So that's how they came to us, and then we decided that, you know, for the highest value to impact would definitely be on the prescription verification, because that's something where there isn't a tool off the shelf you can buy and implement, whereas for say marketing, there's so many tools out there now that you can experiment with that them. So we decided on that path to go after identifying like what three or four problems that could be solved using AI, we said this is the one that makes perfect sense to build out our custom solution for it.\n\nAnd prescription verification means, I guess what does it mean, and then like what is, what's the process, the analog or or, you know, before state process look like?\n\nYeah, so um, the client was an Eyewear Company e-commerce eyewear company, and uh, they also sell prescription sunglasses. Um, now not every prescription is eligible to get a sunglass because it doesn't that the the curvature of the sunglass, the way it's built, cannot handle all the prescription, and they had about 10 of SKUs, and so each of them had a specific limit to what prescription ranges it could fit, right? So now the way it was working was a potential customer would come into the website, they would upload their prescription, and they would select which glasses they were interested in, and then this would go to a contractor that they had hired who would look at those, you know, the prescription that they had filled out, the glasses that they were interested in, and then looking at those glasses and seeing whether those glasses um, could handle that prescription or not, whether they were in the range or not. And then after that, the contractor would send out an email back to the the customer, and the customer get a link to now go and purchase the the the frames that they wanted.\n\nHow did you go about designing a solution to make it more efficient?\n\nSo we, you know, when you're designing a solution, you got to think about whether it's going to be client facing or what we call crew facing. So is it an internal tool that you're using, um, or is it something that your customers would directly interact with? In this case, this was something that, you know, the the client's customers would directly interact with, which means that there are less margin for error. Um, you want very low latency, and you want it to be quite robust and scalable, right? So, it doesn't quite come crashing down. Given that, we quickly realized that, you needed a more robust\n\n\nInfrastructure in place and a little bit more what we call edus handling, error handling.\nSo, we automated that.\nUm, you taking the entire almost most of was a human out of the loop.\nSo now what what what we designed was a system where the customer uploads their prescription.\nIt now goes to our AWS servers, right?\nYou're collecting the data.\nYou're collecting their email.\nYou're collecting the data and there's an OCR happens that reads the prescription, validates it, make sure that's still in date, not expired, and then it looks at what the customer requested, which frame they wanted.\nAnd then in that frame, and given this prescription, can it does it fit or not?\nRight?\nThere's you know there's different like like there's different nuances to it.\nSo some frames like there's there's spheres that they can handle.\nSo it's it's something where it's a mix of AI which is probabilistic and actual like algorithms which is more deterministic.\nSo once I've already done the OCR and you have figure out what is it that they didn't need, then you have to hand it over to a more deterministic software you know an actual like algorithm if you will that tells okay that gives out which lens it which lens or frames are eligible and then hand it back to an agent which then crafts the reply and gives it back.\nSo that's a simple MVP where you're again sending the email back right but now you're automating most of it.\nNow the next MVP that we did was once we knew that it worked, instead of sending an email back, change the page on their Shopify website to go to your desired like shopping page.\nAgain, that took the processing time from a couple of hours to a couple of days, which was, you know, before state to now literally a couple of seconds.\nYou upload it, you click it.\n97% of the cases it would just take you to whatever it is that you needed.\nUm, and also like what if like you want say XYZ frame but that's not eligible.\nThere's an opportunity to upsell you, right?\nUh, maybe you're eligible for like ABC frame.\nMaybe that's not what you wanted, but maybe that's the only frame that fits.\nSo, can you now prompt them towards that side and upsell them?\nUm, so there's those ROIs as well.\nUm, I would add one last thing.\nUm, is that there's still a human in the loop uh process, right?\nFor again we're automating about 95% of them and there's those 5% where you know uh the OCR doesn't come out that well it's not in our confidence range that we can just ask the client to immediately you know go and purchase it that is where we're still putting humans in the loop u to double check to make the final decision um and um and giving 95% autonomy to the agent.\nCool and so the the before state was long manual process.\nThe after state was for the most part like fully automated process.\nSometimes a human in the loop but a much faster process and one that is less lossy I guess because you know you're waiting a couple days someone may change their mind.\nUh you know you mentioned that this creates other opportunities to offer products to the customer.\nWhat were the end results of this to the e-commerce company?\nThey were great.\nThey were great.\nSo, first was a almost complete reduction in contractor cost, right?\nWhat was about 10 hours of contractor per week was almost half an hour now.\nAnd this was something that the founders would have to sometimes do on the weekends because there was just an overwhelming number of um requests that came in.\nUh so that was also eliminated.\nSo the founders got their weekends back.\nUm, and sometimes the contractors would be on leave, so like the founders had to pick up the slack.\nSo that also got eliminated.\nUm, and then so that was about uh up to like about $3,000 in the savings uh wages savings.\nAnd then you know what we saw was a noticeable increase in uh conversion rates, right?\nUm now I you know you're capturing some of those impulse purchases as well because there is no need to wait for the Verification and so that increased conversion um I think it was something like $200,000 of increased our estimated was that over the year they'll have over $200,000 of increased sales from that increased convert due to a faster response time.\nYeah.\nSo you both cut costs, which I guess was presumably the original hypothesis.\nYou'd be able to do this more efficiently with less people.\nYou'd save some money, but then in doing so, you also grew the company's revenue.\nSo the\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd how long did it take to deploy this?\nAbout four to six weeks.\nUm, so took about a week to design it, two to three weeks to set it up and then rest of the time was doing testing and new valves to make sure that it works.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWhat other types of companies could something like this be relevant for?\nUnderstanding that prescription verification is specific to Eyewear, but uh are there other types of businesses where something like this could be relevant?\nYes.\nRight.\nFirst, you know, one thing that you have to understand is this was a replicable process.\nSo, anything that is replicable, you can automate.\nThat's that's my hypothesis.\nThat's what I believe in.\nAnd there might be other companies that that are e-commerce companies uh where they have something like that where there has to be a human in the loop to approve something.\nThose are processes that you could automate.\nMaybe other professional services, I guess, um is something that comes to mind.\nThere's probably a lot of PDF imports that they do and they have to scan it.\nThey have to manually copy data from one PDF to another or one PDF to a sheet or somewhere.\nSo that those are places where you could use similar technologies.\nWhat a great example.\nMany SMBs and startups aren't really adopting AI.\nFor someone considering curious about using AI in their business today, what's like the most effective first step that they can take?\nI think we talked about this.\nIt's basically being open to experimentation.\nThat is without doubt the first step that everyone should take.\nExperiment.\nTry to build custom workflows using custom GPTs.\nUse a lot of chat bots.\nBe be open to the idea that AI is going to augment most of the work.\nDon't fall into the hype that AI is going to replace people but you know believe that it's going to augment your your work.\nGive your team permission to experiment with chat GPT.\nClaude, Gemini, your choice of chat chatbot.\nAsk them to build workflows.\nAsk them to you know build custom GPTs and and once the experiment is done, ask them to share it.\nAsk them to share it within the company wherever you know within themselves, their colleagues.\nSo see what sticks out, right?\nIf there is something that's common across all of your employees or all of your teammates, that's something you could, you know, now take the next step, which would be creating more custom um application solutions around it.\nAlso like um avoid the extremes when you're doing this.\nSo, don't don't um go for um overly complex um automation solutions that you'll see on LinkedIn cuz those are often tailored to a very specific use case and your use case will almost 100% not be that use case.\nUh and it's just not worth the effort to, you know, implement that.\nYeah.\nSo, yeah.\nCool.\nUm, as we like look forward, what do you think will truly set apart those SMBs that successfully adopt AI from those that struggle?\nThat's a great question.\nA couple of things come to mind.\nFirst, you know, it's going to be those who are willing to change and adapt uh while not forgetting why they exist, right?\nEvery company exists to solve a problem, but you can change and adapt the way you solve that problem.\nThose that pay special attention to design and aesthetics, especially in when you know when there's just so many so much AI slop out out there.\nUh those that pay special attention to their customers.\nUm so you know AI should enhance customer experience not replace it.\nAgain human the loop is important.\nYou don't want all of your customer service going to AI maybe like 80% 50%.\nUm the you the ones who implement AI solutions thoughtfully not because they can simply because they can but because it's something that they should where the ROI makes sense and it's something that's actually good for their customers.\nAnd lastly, you know, it would be companies that use AI to amplify their unique strengths rather than trying to be everything at once, be everything to everyone.\nThey're doubling down on their speciality and using AI to amplify their themselves.\nYeah.\nYou mentioned professional services firms early on in our conversation about opportunities.\nWhat what what should professional services firms be doing today?\nAnd maybe the answer is what you just described, but what should they be doing today to ensure that they benefit from this technology and not you know be disrupted by it?\nBecause they they obviously are a category of business that is human capital driven and AI in many ways can do a lot of things faster and more consistently than humans can do.\nAnd so if you were running a professional services firm, a consulting firm or an agency, what would you be doing today?\nIt'd be looking at my junior most consultants and looking at places where they're doing a lot of replicable work, manual work, grunt work, which could be now automated using AI or tools or agents.\nI'd be thinking about re-evaluating the pyramid structure.\nUm, and maybe the future is where the there's less junior consultants.\nUm it's more mid-consultants heavy with those who have expertise in their field already compared to those out of colleges looking to build expertise in the consulting firm.\nAnd then the third part is you know professional services is all about human connection right.\nSo professional services as a industry segment is not going away because humans trust humans not robots.\nSo you know in this I guess the next logical play is can you now augment yourself using the right AI at the right level and then train your next generations of leaders to double down on the human side of um connections and business.\nI love it.\nUm, Nitesh, thank you so much for coming by.\nJust\nThank you so much to uh to you know, thanks for having me here.\n",
