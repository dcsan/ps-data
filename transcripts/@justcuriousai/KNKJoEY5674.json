  "cleanText": "Why do so many organizations struggle to scale AI adoption beyond initial use cases? How can leaders overcome cultural resistance and confidently measure AI's tangible impact? They will tackle these crucial questions with Carl Miller and Marco Crolla, founders of The Grin Labs. Carl and Marco combine decades of experience in digital transformation, organizational change, and AI implementation, specializing in turning AI from pilot projects to measurable business outcomes. We'll explore overcoming pilot purgatory, addressing cultural resistance, and practically measuring AI's real ROI.\n\nCarl and Marco, great to have you here.\n\nThanks, D.\n\nGreat to be here. Before we dive in, can you both share how your individual journeys led you to focus on helping organizations move beyond AI experimentation into true lasting adoption?\n\nAbsolutely. So, I've started with and been working with tech-based startups for too long than I can share, actually, a few decades. And one of the things I found is oftentimes the conversations are around the technology and the product and the service. And ultimately what it comes down to is what I believe is the people. And something that you mentioned in your intro is it's really about carrying around the culture and the people and understanding what drives innovation, and ultimately what we believe is that that's part of that is the growth mindset and how leadership frames newness, if you will, or, you know, things that are coming into the organization. So that's been always part of the way that I've worked within companies. And now that AI is here over the last 2 years or so, we feel it's an opportunity to bring that same ethos, that same way of thinking into organizations. And ultimately, it's not just about technology. It's not just about data. It's really about the thoughtfulness of leaders and how they incorporate and build and develop into their organization. So happy to be here.\n\nThanks, Carl.\n\nYeah. So my journey is I've been essentially a transformational change leader for 25 plus years. I started with Accenture. I've had a couple of different software companies along the way and also held management positions at three different software companies, generally in some sort of transformational role. So I wrapped up with a software company a little over a year ago now and decided to jump back into consulting. What better area to jump into, which is AI, which is something that organizations are really struggling to figure out how best to utilize and implement. So I think what I'm bringing to the table is the years of transformational change, understanding what it means to drive change in organizations, and really applying that to the AI challenge. So excited to do that.\n\nWhen executives first approach you two, what common signs indicate that their organization is having challenges scaling initial AI success?\n\nOne of the things we hear all the time is that, you know, this has landed on the CTO or the CIO's desk. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but ultimately there's a lot of, you know, when we're talking to a CEO and they mention, hey, you know, we're just not seeing the adoption. We've purchased these licenses and and we're not seeing that, you know, the company has really, you know, stepped into this fully. Often times, it's because they see this as a software adoption or some other old way of thinking about how we're going to deploy technology throughout our organization. And it's our belief, and Marco and I go back and forth with this. I mean, in some ways it is true, okay, it is, you know, there there's some old, some other ways of deploying technologies that are part of the process, but ultimately we feel that there's, you know, that this is different. It's a little bit of, you know, this isn't software, this isn't search, this is some other type of thing, some other type of magic that people haven't experienced before. There's different levels of anxiety, there's different, you know, there's ways of bringing the ingenuity and innovation to the individual that they haven't had before that's percolating, whether the CEO knows it or not. But to answer your question, that's one of the indicators is like, you know, we've purchased some of these tools and technologies, but we don't see further adoption. Not as many people as we thought are using the tool. And Mark, I don't know if you can add to that as as other things that we hear.\n\nWhat we see is they've also maybe they've rolled out some training, but they're just not seeing the value, and inevitably what they're doing is that the early adopters are latching on to it and they're probably finding some value. They're not necessarily sharing that value with others and building that flywheel of innovation and getting others to on board using the technology, demonstrating value. I would say the other thing is that maybe they haven't identified a couple of real big, major use case workflows within the organization that will, if they implement AI as a solution, could really move the needle either from a topline or bottom line perspective. So they haven't started to get that momentum going that is critical.\n\nYeah. And so when someone comes to you with that problem, where do you typically start?\n\nWhat we'd like to do is start from the top, which is understanding, you know, what are your goals around AI? What is the management perspective on AI? I mean, I think it's really critical that from the top that there is the execs are walking the talk. So helping them with defining what that looks like, you know, understanding what is it that why are you stuck? Is it specifically around the training thing? Is it specifically around just an adoption? Is it where's it stuck? It could be that there may not be a strategy. Maybe people are fearful either of losing jobs or they're just fearful of using the technology because they don't know, they haven't been given any guard rails. So just understanding what that is and maybe putting a what we have as kind of a framework to help say, okay, well, we can help with an AI strategy if that's something that you need. We can help with your executive alignment and some of the messages that we think are really important that executives deliver, like, like, uh, just recently Toby at at Shopify, right, is there's a very clear message that, hey, this is what we're doing, get on board, get curious, get trained, you're going to be measured in this way. And by the way, in many instances, it's you're not going to lose your job. This is about efficiencies. This is about scaling. This is about doing more with less. Um, and then it's, you know, the other parts of what we take them through is maybe the issue is around. Do you have a lightweight, at least a lightweight governance process in place to to manage this change, to drive the change? Do you have some activities that are going to encourage people to use the technology, to share, to celebrate, um, you know, do you have those things in place? And then, you know, do you have some level of measurement of success? What does success look like in your mind? And that may be around adoption or it may be around ROI.\n\nYou mentioned fear and you mentioned communication maybe as a solution to that. How do you typically address the cultural side of AI adoption, particularly when stakeholders are resistant to change or many are fearful of change?\n\nI think first and foremost as well, and I think Mark would touch on this, is that asking the leaders, like, how often do they use it? Are they using AI? Because ultimately, if and when they're, well, as they use it and as they communicate their journey, I think that that creates at least an ounce of psychological safety of like, oh, it's okay to use this tool, which some people are even asking that question, right? And if they see their leadership as using it and getting productivity on it and sharing their, you know, failures and their successes around it, then ultimately the company realizes, oh, wait, you know, at the top, they're they're starting to use these technologies, it's okay for, so first and foremost, it's okay for me to use these technologies or AI as I work. So I think that that's a first place that's incredibly important is that the top level leadership, they're using these tools. And I think in addition to that, we face it head on. I mean, it is literally in forums, we create forums where people can raise their concerns in a safe place and um, I think we need to stay address those concerns and also recognize that they're out there, whether people are verbalizing them or not. So you can, you can also make sure that there is, there are clear messages out there and actions. You know, you can't say we're not going to lose any jobs and then fire, you know, half the workforce because we've been really successful with AI. I think, I think it's um, right now it's all about doing more with less using the existing workforce and trying not to add additional headcount if possible while scaling.\n\nWho typically reaches out to you from an organization? Is it the CEO and so you have that executive buy-in from the beginning, or is it other people within the organization, and so you sometimes you have to help that suite upskill and begin using the technology so that there's misalignment? What does that typically look like?\n\nYeah, I think it's both. Sometimes executives that have realized uh, and the pool of executives that reaches out that are saying, &quot;Oh, we need to proactively do something.&quot; They've basically almost all of them, and one of the first sentences they say is, we realize that our industry is going to be transformed by AI, period, and we need to stay, we want to be thought leaders in that space. So those are the CEOs that are reaching out. Otherwise, it's the AI advocates within the organization that are raising their hands saying, you know what, we know how this is working. We've seen the disruption a lot of times coming from the bottom up, but we don't have complete executive buy-in yet and we need that assistance in terms of helping like communicate what this journey could look like and what the benefits are. So I think those are the general camps that we're seeing. Um, I don't know if you have anything to add to that, Margot.\n\nOh, I think you kept it well.\n\nHow do you typically engender executive buy-in if there's skepticism initially?\n\nI think there, there's several, you know, first and foremost, you have to go to the to the climate and the context of the conversation, right? So if you're working with somebody, I mean, you know, on on the on a general note, we have to get a, we have to understand, you know, where that particular executive team is at in their journey and where their competition is at, though if, for example, they're working in a very competitive environment, I was having a conversation earlier today where the exact stakeholder of that's trying to get executive buy-in and said, &quot;You know what? Our competition is, you know, they're building and developing with AI and our executive team doesn't even necessarily know it. We have an internal builder that's, you know, within the company that's recreated the website as a datadriven website that we should be publishing as our website. All of these movements are happening, but our CEOs are and our our not CEO, but our sea levels aren't necessarily on board yet.&quot; And so I think it's just a matter of sometimes, you know, these individuals are asking for an authority or a different voice that can come in and voice some of the realities that are currently happening. And in this case, we would say, here's what's happening in your industry. Were you aware of this? So really setting the context of the conversation is is part of it.\n\nYeah. And I, I, I think in addition to that, I mean, how we do it is we surface those concerns with the executive team in the room. We workshop as part of the kind of defining what the strategy is and what the messaging is. It's it's it's raising those concerns. Um, there's also an element of education in some instances for exec teams, just, you know, what's the, where are we at? What's the hype? What's the reality? Uh, how could you benefit? And also I think, I think with a lot of people, it's how do I fit in with AI? Like AI is is a super powerful tool, but it's really powerful when it's used in conjunction with people. And so that using AI as a thought partner, for example, really resonates with a lot of execs. It's like, okay, I get it. That makes sense. It can help me, but it doesn't doesn't replace me. It doesn't make me less than. It in fact makes me a stronger person. So I think raising those things in a room is how we we try to do it as best as we can to surface those concerns.\n\nYou shared an example of work you'd done with a digital agency that I thought clearly illustrated the practical impact of um AI. Maybe we can walk through that case study. I would love to understand the kind of before and after scenarios and then how you got from before to after and so who came to you and and what was the initial problem and then where'd you go from there?\n\nWell, I mean, I think, you know, in terms of who came to us, it was the CEO in this case, and it was very much a CEO that was coming to us saying, you know what, this entire, our entire industry is going to be disrupted by some of these tools. And we realize that, but he was very much that CEO that was saying, but my people aren't coming along board. You know, they're not coming on board. I'm using this stuff. I see the power of it, but there's a lot of skepticism. And you know, whether you know, he even defined it as fear, you know, so it was the CEO in this case that said, you know what, we need to do something and I need your help. And then Marco, you can take it from there, I guess.\n\nYeah, so in that case, we we took it, took them through our whole kind of value acceleration process, which is uh, we sat down with um, with the executive team, we did some initial training education, I would say more around AI. We gave them some homework around what uh, they needed to think about from an AI strategy perspective, and then we kind of workshopped that through um, and got to a strategy, and the strategy was pretty straightforward, and this is a, this is a, you know, medium-sized digital agency, so we didn't want to go overboard. We had to pitch the AI strategy, and it was not a, you know, a McKenzie tome of a strategy. It was a, I don't know, five-page strategy, which just essentially outlined how do we, how do we think about AI within the company? Um, what are the leaders committed to? What are our kind of big, we call them the big rocks or those big use cases that we believe are going to move the needle by implementing AI? Where do we want to get to from a maturity perspective? It's those types of things. So, we workshopped that. We also talked about just a very light governance structure, uh, kind of a steering committee of sorts, how that would work. Um, and then we've worked with them to flesh out, look at their current state processes, identify where the opportunities are for AI to improve those processes, put in place a measurement system to say, okay, so how much time do you spend on X, Y, and Z? So one of\n\n\nThe thing is matching brands to creators. For example, another one is campaign management, so there are opportunities there. There are some sort of sticking points and friction points that we've identified, um, and that were clear opportunities to implement AI solutions. Those rocks, did they come to you with those rocks and those opportunity areas, or did you do an assessment with them and look at their business and the businesses within the business and the various workflows to identify where might there be opportunities to improve efficiency or quality through AI? How did you go about selecting? That was a good question. Initial areas. In this case, they had identified, I mean, with some prodding and facilitation from us, but they were pretty clear on what those big rocks were from the top, at least for now. I mean, I think one of the other things that we've been doing is then, so we talk, that's all what I just described as quite top-down. We've also gone through training of the whole workforce, a couple of different sessions around the whole workforce, and we've created a change plan to kind of encourage people to use the technology. And I think out of that, there'll be individuals who will identify specific additional sticking points. Um, and then what we've talked to them about is, and what we've been working with them on, is creating a longer-term road map. So there's these initial big rocks that they want to go after, but then what, right? And some of those then whats will surface from bottom up, right? People who are closest to the mine head, if you like, who really understand what the challenges and problems are and can even come up with suggested solutions, given the training and their exploration. What criteria makes for a high-quality rock, a high-quality use case that can be improved with AI? On the big rock side, on the larger scale side, it's something that has major value to the organization, where that value is either around, you know, cost savings or potential revenue upside, so that has some complexity to it, you know, that that is potentially across multiple departments, um, and that can be, but that we can see a near end to. So it's not something that, you know, right now that we're defining a project that would be, you know, a year-long project, but the more has, you know, within a few months, we can see achievable success. So that would sort of be sort of that top-level down, and sometimes these, you know, if they're uncovered, you know, potentially there could be real value derived within a month, you know, how quick AI moves. So it just really depends on the scenario. And then the sort of the bottom up or the some of these quick win projects, those are defined by ultimately people's, like we talked about from the beginning, people and their intuition and their and their innovative spirit and passion around, you know, improving their own workflows or their team workflows, and ultimately that comes down to how you know, potentially using simple tools like custom GPTs within, you know, chat GPT and the finds that can be had there. There's that famous case study of, I think, the National Park Service, right, where they basically came in and said, \"Oh, hey, there's, you know, after one training, one individual created a custom GPT, and from that, it was around procurement and ordering, and from that, they, it spread throughout the National Park Service from that one custom GPT, and it saved projections that it saved the National Park Service, you know, 20 years of work type of thing or work time.\" So those are ultimately, you know, both of those are critically important. I think that that's where one of the ways that we differentiate ourselves is that there's a lot of companies going out there and talking about tech and talking about data and whatnot. And ultimately where we come in is we say, you know, it is important to have these governance and strategy and and helping leadership define the AI journey, but it's equally as important to understand that a lot of this value can be derived from the individuals that are sparked into this with throughout the organization. Yeah. And in that agency case, you identified these rocks and kind of solidified which workflows you were going to look to, um, improve upon with AI. And then what ultimately did you deploy? Did you build some custom GPTs to improve that brand, um, uh, kind of agency marketing? So there were a few things. One is essentially, we had to break apart the workflow, right? So the workflow had several different steps to it, and in each part of that workflow, there were different decisions to be made. So part of it was, do we acquire a technology from another company that could potentially help us from that particular portion of the workflow? And some of the decisioning around, you know, enhancing this big rock was indeed in that category because there are certain data sets and other areas that they needed to basically say, okay, we need to work with this technology provider, um, which happened to be around AI, right? Um, but then other parts of the workflow in the same workflow, um, you know, it was more about, oh, let's test and iterate and build and develop a custom GPT that can help us, um, with identifying some of this unstructured data that we haven't been able to visualize yet and build and develop around that. And so then you basically have those decision points throughout the big rock, and ultimately what it comes down to is, imagine several different decision points and saying, okay, where now can we prioritize these ease versus impact, right? So if we say, okay, it's really easy to go out there and create this other partnership that's going to rank pretty high, it's going to have a big impact to this big rock, so let's go ahead and move with that. And then we just sort of walk through and say, okay, what's the next best thing to build and develop and to start testing and iterating around before we make any decisions that are going to be, you know, that we can't unroll because ultimately this is also about the innovative mindset and knowing that, okay, we're here to reduce the risk and uncertainty as we build and develop and test and unroll this and create value. So that's how we're, that's our approach in general. And Marco, I don't know if you want to add to that. No, I think in summary, it was a combination of off-the-shelf and custom, uh, custom GPT, custom workflows, and you know, we're very cognizant of the fact that there's a lot of startups in this space. I think just making sure that if you do decide to do the buy option, that it is something that you truly believe that this company is going to be around in the next year or so. And so, you know, helping the client think through those things as they decide on the build versus buy that decision. Before scenario was the CEO was interested and curious, the organization was not really using the technology. What does the after scenario look like for this digital agency? It's a work in progress. It's a journey that we're on with them, and they're, you know, right now they're working through and building and developing out their next generation of these large enterprise sort of big rock type of environments. And then at the same time, we're starting to feel and understand and feel the energy and the movement from the individuals within the organization. But I think the big find here is that there's no real end state. It's more of where we're at in the journey, and ultimately, you know, you've got a lot of AI noise out there, and I think what, at least from the feedback that we've gotten, is that both from the executive team and from the individuals in the organization, is they feel held and supported through this process, you know, so that they now know how to judge and understand the AI noise as it relates to them, and so that they have a lot more confidence as they build and develop and ultimately say, okay, now we can compete in this next generation of where we think the industry was moving versus when we first came to, you know, the CEO, he felt completely, you know, out of the water in terms of just not knowing where he was at, where the competition was at, and how, you know, the confidence in terms of organizationally how they could continue to compete within his industry. So hopefully that addresses your question there. How do you typically measure success in an engagement like this? You mentioned the energy was much better after you all worked together. Were there other metrics that they're able to like hang their hat on in terms of, um, kind of the return on this investment and adoption? I mean, I think it's a lot of it is around time savings, um, and then com, and then, um, also looking at when for those time savings, how did people use that time saving to drive additional, so there's kind of the revenue uplift aspect to it as well. So, so, and then the other, in this case, the other thing was more around the NPS on both their brand on the brand side as well as for their, uh, their creators in terms of that experience. So creating a better experience for both sides through the AI solutions that you design leads to hopefully better stickiness, maybe revenue opportunities in the future. Revenue opportunities, upsell. Exactly. You also shared a FinTech example. Maybe we could quickly share more about how you had helped them optimize their RFP process. Um, yeah, I'd love to hear sort of again, what was the problem they came to you with, and where ultimately did they land once they worked with you? Yeah, so it's a global FinTech, and ultimately they were coming to us for, like, a very, we meet the companies where they're at, right? And so their main, one of the struggles that they were having is being global, they had, there was a lot of, just call it, latency between communications between departments in terms of how they could, how they were responding to RFPs. And so ultimately, there was a bunch of siloed information and key stakeholders that held information, and so it was taking a long time, and they didn't feel like they were getting the best results. So essentially what we did is we did some testing and iteration with them with some common off-the-shelf LLM type of tools, started to build and develop a knowledge database that could then respond within the rule set of what it is that they were looking to accomplish. And they felt the results of that were not only just, oh, hey, here's, you know, a good quality RFP, but what their experience was is, oh, here's one of the best RFPs we've ever responded to. And the time it takes now for them to respond to RFTs has gone from anywhere from 38 plus hours to within 8 to 12 hours. So there's that immediate benefit of not having to wait to see if so-and-so is going to be on the phone in Bulgaria or London, but to get that knowledge and wisdom into one place so that they could have that cadence of response and execute in a way that was meaningful to that particular customer, uh, and that that response would not just be a general response, but something that was speaking to that customer, what those customers need. I'm sure every situation is different, but what does a typical engagement look like from a timeline perspective from when someone comes to you with the problem? You've signed a SO or some such to the engagement being completed. What does that, what does that calendar look like? So on the initial projects and the scope of the initial project, well, we take companies from what we would call like a level one company. And when we say level one company, it's companies that have ad hoc usage of individuals within the organization, haven't defined their strategy, their governance, the leadership hasn't communicated their journey of deployment throughout AI. So that's sort of like the level one to a level two org where it's like, oh, okay, here's the journey. Here's where we're on. Here's a strategy and governance. That process can be as little as six weeks. So going in there and helping them define and put them, put the organization really on the rails of here's what AI means to us, and here's how we play with that AI. Beyond that, you know, with the scope of enterprise, you know, looking at the enterprise and saying, okay, here's some of the initiatives that we want to tackle, that can extend, of course, into more of the four-to-six-month process of let's work with this organization to help them further define what the scope of this project is, but then also hold their hand and work with them in developing a success around that. And then beyond that, there's the change side as well, and the change plan and helping not just from a tech side of things, but also helping define who those high-level proficiency users are and then the different troughs of users and how we work and develop the muscle of what it means to work with AI within the organization, which could be, which could be a, you know, an ongoing process, of course. Yeah. Uh, for companies that have gone from level one to level two, how do you suggest they continue adapting and innovating once those initial AI implementations have shown success? You know, I think it's, you know, it's like any large change initiative or program, I think having the right governance in place, identifying new opportunities for AI, and that when I say AI, I mean improvement. It could end up being on some kind of organizational road map. There are some projects that utilize AI. There are some that may not end up utilizing AI. They're all vying for the same resources. So, but I think either plugging into an existing structure, governance structure, or creating one to keep that momentum going. I think in this case, there's also an element of our belief, as I said, we believe that innovation comes from below, but it means that everybody in the organization needs to be using AI, so continuing to move through that kind of figuring out what are the change activities, additional training, whatever that may be, but continuing to fertilize the soil, if you like, to make sure that that grass is growing, uh, kind of bottom up as well. We touched on this a bit with respect to mitigating fear through communication, but as AI increasingly automates routine knowledge work, how should leaders balance those desired efficiency gains with the risk of reducing workforce morale or job satisfaction? Sure. I mean, I think ultimately what it comes down to is the fear and the anxiety of the workforce comes from not feeling seen in a lot of ways or not feeling like they're being supported or not communicating what the journey looks like. And so to mitigate the risk of, I think your question is around, you know, how do you keep people incented or excited about the potential of how the organization is evolving into the next stage of workforce. The answer is, you know, slow things down when needed. I mean, Bryce from MADNA has a really nice way of dealing with, you know, people that he's noticed are not necessarily, um, you know, using AI in a way that would share that, okay, they're using it at a way that they're really on board. What he does is basically just say, okay, you know, we're going to re-engage with those individuals. We're going to have a personalized training session with them where he himself is involved with that and can really sit down and slow down and say, you know, where are you getting stuck?\n\n\nHow are these things working?\nYou know what, how can we help?\n\nAnd so I think it's ultimately about, you know, making sure that individuals understand where they're at in the journey, where the company's at in the journey, and making sure that they feel seen in the areas that they're at.\nI mean, Marco and I talk about all the time some more valuable moments, but some of the most valuable moments we have within organizations are when the individuals are sharing about their fears or their anxieties and how we can be there and validate their concerns and then also at the same time making sure that they're empowered to make different types of choices within their day.\n\nSo yeah and I and I think in addition to build on that which is as you go through these transformational changes I think there's a lot of similarities to how we historically have done transformations.\nI think perhaps one of the areas that will come to the surface is that jobs are going to be redefined.\nSo the role that you had when you joined and pre-AI may look very different than what you end up doing during the AI implementation certainly as we use AI more and more and functions will change and potentially the org structures will change.\nSo I think there's an important work stream with this transformation effort which is is looking at kind of job design and organization design.\nSo it may not be about losing people.\nIt's about repositioning people.\nIt's about giving them new opportunities and it it's fundamentally changing how organizations operate and the role of the people in those.\nWhat a good place to end.\nCarl and Marco.\nThank you for coming on to just curious and sharing your experience in helping leaders overcome cultural resistance and also turn their AI pilot projects into measurable outcomes.\nThank you.\nThanks J.\nCall.\n",
