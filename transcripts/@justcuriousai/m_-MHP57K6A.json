  "cleanText": "Today on Just Curious, I'm joined by Nicole Castillo, Vice President of Strategic Products at News Corp, where she leads AI strategy across some of the world's biggest content and information businesses. But Nicole's also a writer, a mom, and a creative force of nature. In this episode, we'll explore how she blends AI into both her professional and personal life, from vendor vetting and business model strategy to writing Substack posts and bedtime stories with Chat GPT. Learn how she's building an AI ROI framework to cut through the noise of vendor hype, how she's piloting tools with the real benchmarks for success, and how she uses AI daily from streamlining finance operations to fast-tracking LinkedIn posts. Nicole, welcome to Just Curious.\n\nI am very happy to be here and I'm very curious how this conversation's going to go. Appreciate your use of Curious. Um, Nicole, your bio calls you the Mary Poppins of product. Can you tell us the story behind that nickname and how it connects to your AI journey?\n\nSure. Um, so Mary confidence of product happened shortly after I joined News Corp. I had I don't even remember the the like exact moment, but I remember seeing something that caused me to be like, \"Oh, that's totally me.\" I texted my old boss and I was like, \"Isn't this me?\" And he's like, \"Totally.\" And it sort of stuck and I I leaned in really hard because it really is I think everyone when they think of Mary Poppins, they're like, \"Oh, delightful.\" There's something about her that like you think is fun, but she's a little like hardedged, but like in a good way, like the best ways. And she has that magical bag of tricks and she just brings a lot of spoonful of sugar and super califragilistic expeladocious to everything. And I feel like that's totally me. Like I feel like if I can slip in a long word like that into any meeting and it just is really I think part of being scrappy, part of being creative, part of being curious about the world and bringing people on that journey. She brings these children along. I bring people stakeholders along with me on the magical journey that is you know creating wonderful products.\n\nCuriosity and creativity obviously helpful when you're looking at something new like AI. Tell me how you got involved in helping News Corp understand and build a strategy to use AI.\n\nSadly accidentally. Um but I but I think it ultimately worked out and and there's a reason for it. Um I had actually just come back from my maternity leave for my second um child, my beautiful son, and things had changed. I had actually hired to lead mobile products. And I came back and I was like, I'm looking to to have more impact, do more things. And it was like, well, this new thing AI has become more of a a thing. Why don't you step into that? And so I started leaning into what do we do with AI? And much of my initial first steps were like just like uncovering the hype. It's like you're trying to like like is that real? Is that interesting? Is that important? Is that important for us for our business? And so I got the chance to really fall into it. But I think especially today where so much of the impact of AI is on people and is on experiences. I'm not saying it's less about the tech. There is definite need for data scientists and for people who have this really deeply technical skill to build these things, but so much of today is the democratization of AI and how people will use it. And I think product leaders, people leaders are ones to really help lead this new journey of AI for themselves, for their companies, for people within organizations.\n\nYeah. Why why do media companies care about AI? And and when I think about AI, obviously, and I believe News Corp and Dow Jones have been investing in AI for a long time, but when we're thinking about the next generation of AI, the generative AIs, the agentic AIs, the combination of traditional AI with new AI, why do media companies care about this future of AI?\n\nWell, I think regardless of media or not, everyone should care because I think those who aren't moving into AI or aren't at least thinking about it are going to be left behind. I think media companies are more sensitive to it. There's obviously an IP angle to this. Large language models are powered by massive amounts of content to make them good and many of them have already used much of the content that is sort of out there. And so whatever new content is important to lead the next wave of great AI solutions and models. So I think you know media companies have this really important role to play in the future of how AI models get built and how they are getting better and how they'll really embed into the world. So I think but regardless I think every company should consider AI as an important part of where they take their business. Now it could be generative it could it could be something else but I think everyone should be deeply curious about how how AI could impact their companies. Yeah. Uh you work in a business with many business units. How do you coordinate AI strategy across so many brands and businesses, especially when priorities can differ?\n\nMuch like everyone who has jobs that are like hurting cats with great care and intention? Well, I I think, you know, we are in a really unique organization where not only do we have these amazing news brands, but we have real estate, we have book publishing, and like you said, there are different business needs that drive each of those businesses. Even in within the news businesses, there's different, you know, business models. And much of what it is is I'm a big connector. I connect the teams and the people that are are doing one thing and say, \"By the way, do you know that this group is doing it and they're doing it really well?\" and connecting those people and making sure that they're aware because ultimately we don't want duplication of you know if something is done really well you want to share that and that's the benefit of working in a large organization such such as news corporate somebody can take the lead and prove out and prove successful or prove something not successful and share the lessons learned for that journey or share the teaching so even you know one of our smaller business units who might be able to do more bleeding edge things with some of the AI models that some others cannot can still share. Oh, I had a lot of friction. For instance, you know, uh sensitive content. Many of the models have protection or guard rails against sensitive content. But news content has sometimes sensitive topics. And so, how do you get and work with models when some of those things are restricted? So, those are like little small lessons that I heard that in this one meeting with this one business unit and I managed to kind of help feed and filter that through the businesses. So it's creating that connective tissue more than it is you know pushing down a centralized mission and vision. We do have guard rails and principles in place on how to as a whole work and exist within kind of how you you build and use AI. I don't think there's any benefit to sort of like having a strong restriction on you know businesses leaning in and figuring out what works for them either.\n\nYeah. What have you learned in terms of the best ways to facilitate sharing it? Uh do you have a you know Slack channel and people are just dropping ideas in there? Do you set up you know monthly standups where people are um encouraged to share learnings like how how especially in a big organization? Yeah. global organization. How do you get those learnings from like the small company here to the big unit there ensure that like all those learnings are leveraged across you know the entire organization?\n\nThat's a great question and I feel like it's not a cookie cutter approach to everything. One thing that I really struggled with when I first kind of started taking this over is like who do you invite to a meeting on AI? If you think about that and you think about like hey let's do a big global AI meeting it's almost impossible because if you think about you have people that are just generally interested in AI and want to be there want to listen want to learn there's people that have specific business cases but you might have a finance business case and then you have you know a newsroom business case and they may not be like there's maybe some things to share but also it's kind of like maybe that person will be bored by this particular topic. And then there are practitioners, people that want to go deep and technical and like nerd out on the latest paper they're reading. And so putting all those people in a room and and curating an agenda for that breath of audience is nearly impossible. So what I found I have a couple different things that I' I've deployed is one is I have like a like a global newsletter that goes out internally where I kind of curate here's what's happening in the business here's what's happening in industry here's what's happening kind of broad themes I'll kind of pick and rotate different things and that that serves to those you know that are on the distribution list it's from kind of some very senior executives to people again that are just deeply curious about AI then they get kind of a swath and I was doing that I did that for a year weekly because the pace of things that were moving so fast. Then I changed to bi-weekly and now we're at monthly because I do have to maintain some sanity.\nI've put together like AI community as a practice with a more technical audience to kind of really again get into more technical discussions. I've led workshops and different cases depending on the need and the subject. I just recently helped the hack the finance team and I went with them to do a global hackathon on on AI. And so I don't think there's a one-sizefits-all. And I definitely don't think it's possible to curate like for an organization as big as ours and as many people who are now involved with AI or just interested, it's almost impossible to put them all in a room and do one session that hits all the points from like an executive view to a practitioner builder view and to just anyone who's interested. So, I think you got to hit on a bunch of different levels, a bunch of different avenues. And then sometimes you've got to pause some that, you know, from an overhead may not make sense to continue at a certain pace and find ways to to get the message out. And sometimes it's just really, like I said, connecting people to people. I literally had somebody email me last night from Australia um and it was like hey can you just connect me to you know do you have a list of all the people who are working at the business um on AI and can you connect me to those people and I said well do you want technical people so this is kind of how I framed it earlier like is it technical people is it business people like is there a certain like type of thing that you want to know or learn so I had to ask those questions so that I could say oh you know what I'm going to go ahead and introduce you to this person first because if it's a business person here and and immediately sent an email and was like, \"Hey guys, get together.\" So sometimes it's literally just one-on-one connections and that is part of what I I bring is this kind of collaboration connectivity to to what I do and how I deploy strategy.\n\nWhether it's in finance or the newsroom or some other part of News Corp, is there an approach to identifying the best use cases for AI?\n\nThis one is so tricky for me because I really struggle with when we were just really starting out and it's like what are our best lowhanging fruit use cases and I sort of struggle because it always feels like cart before horse, right? or and it's like okay well what are just the biggest problems in our business regardless of whether or not they can be solved with AI because half the time or more than half the time just sticking AI onto something is not the solution or maybe it's traditional ML AI and not Gen AI and so I feel like sometimes there is a too much of a lean into let's solve it with AI where the question should be what are our biggest problems or what are the problems that we need solutions for now that are really causing our our business to lose money or be inefficient or that we could see growth. So I I think it's hard to say what are the best business cases for or use cases for AI. Although I think we've seen as a general trend. There are some ones that broadly have been easily applied. So like customer service, knowledge management, like those type of things like we're seeing those use cases with CLA and OpenAI like what they did and you're seeing you know stories about AI generated coding as different businesses leaning like X percentage of our code is now done by AI and we're seeing kind of shifts and trends in those places. But I can't say enough about how just identify your problems first. Understand the processes and the people impacted by those processes and the the metrics around it. Because I think too um and we'll probably get to this later is like you have to understand the time something takes now or the amount of money that is spent or the amount of people that do X work to understand the value ad of a solution. So that when you get to, hey, we've we've tried something, we've piloted something, you can say definitively we're seeing x% savings in time or accuracy, etc. So that's a a very long explanation for yes, there are some tried and true use cases that I think are definitely hitting across the board, but I think most business should start with just what are your biggest problems? Yeah. And let's say you've identified a problem. How is there a way to prioritize those problems that are worth solving with AI versus those that are better handled by process or policy? How do you go from that problem to okay, let's let's actually, you know, this is a good fit for AI.\n\nSo this one again is a tangled web. you ask very complex questions that I'm going to have a complex answer for. So in terms of I mean I I do think being pretty methodical of understanding the time something takes. I think depending on the type of technology if there was a really great use case I saw recently where regulatory things that come out quarterly regulatory is your company compliant with this regulation. So you have to scan all these really dense compliance documentation and then you have to understand the company. Does the company need to meet any of these criteria? And then you have to kind of provide recommendations because you're you're reviewing text and there's a lot of time that a person would have to go through to read and understand that text. And then the output is a textbased output, right? It's like yes, no kind of qualification and then a natural language description of what action would you need to take as a company to be compliant. Like to me, like that one just made so much sense and you can then understand how much would a single person need to do to to each\n\n\nQuarter.\nScan these reports?\nHow many reports are there?\nSo, I think there's ones that just, I don't know, make sense.\nBut you mentioned people and process.\nI think on the flip side when it comes to developing whatever solution to the problem, and if AI was the recommended solution, even if those metrics match, so say in this case, you can save a team of, you know, reviewers and 50% of their time by giving them a set of GenAI tools, which will scan x amount of documents and save them so much time, and then all they have to do is review the outputs, make sure they're okay.\nThe problem I really still see is the Change Management and the people side of adopting these tools because I use this phrase a lot.\nPeople are comforted by their pain, or like comfortable with their pain, is like, I know that sometimes I'm not the most efficient person when it comes to doing a task, but I know how to do this in my way.\nAnd for me to change and adapt to like going to this new system, learning these new things, even if I know it will eventually save me time, I have to go through this learning process, which most people, you know, are a little bit skeptical.\nOh, will this change me time?\nLike, you know, so I really do think that even if you prove out that something is a good use case, you build the right thing, people are often forgetting the Change Management and the people adoption side of like successful implementations of technology, especially in this GenAI world.\nSo my word of caution to all, don't forget about the Change Management.\nDon't forget about the adoption, the training needed to bring people along the journey because if you're not bringing them along, it's going to, you're going to build something, you're going to spend a lot of money, and it's not going to have the added value you thought it was.\nYeah.\nWhen it comes to Change Management, are there like some key learnings that you've accrued over the last couple years?\nYou mentioned, you know, training and education and bringing people along.\nIf you had to distill like your philosophy on Change Management into one answer to a question, um, what would it be?\nI think it would be bringing people on the journey, like involve people early and get their input early because I think if, if you think about a user group or like, let's just say in a hypothetical world, um, cuz this never happens, an executive gets in their head that that they want to do something, and they think it's a great idea, and they tell, you know, a tech team or whatever team, build this thing, it'll be great, um, and they build it in a silo, in a vacuum, because right, the CEO is asking, and like, that's a natural inclination to, but if you forget to involve the end users who would be responsible for then using said tool, you, you've missed, you've missed the mark, and ultimately, they're probably going to have like, I think about like a, a, like an organ transplant, they're probably going to reject the organ or the tool, right?\nBecause they're like, you know, it's incompatible with my system.\nNow, it might be, but it's, you didn't, you didn't prep the body.\nYou didn't test the blood work.\nYou didn't check that all the vitals were stable before you inserted this new thing into their, you know, work body.\nAnd so now they're like, \"No, no, it's poison.\nLet's shut this, let's shut this down.\"\nSo, like that's, I went weird to the metaphor place right there, but hopefully it struck a chord.\nWe went to a weird place, but I think we got to a point.\nI like it.\nWe're going to talk a little bit about how you vet AI pitches, but maybe before we do, how do you think about the decision between building internally or bringing in a vendor when it comes to AI initiatives?\nYou know, it's funny because I don't think anything's really changed.\nI'm kind of the same way about like use cases in terms of the build versus buy, like this is a problem of all, you know, tech builders, um, in a company.\nSo I think you want to build things that are, let's see, closest to your core, your core business, I guess.\nUm, now it doesn't have to be wholly built and bespoke.\nUm, like there are great partners with, you know, that we kind of build and augment on top of, um, but I think with build versus buy, I think it's really making sure if you're buying something, how much of it, the thing that you're buying, um, needs to be unique or nuanced for your business and how much doesn't.\nBecause what I've seen is people say, \"Okay, yeah, I want that tool.\nIt's 80% of what I need.\"\n20% will build on this special thing.\nSometimes that 20% costs twice as much of that out of the box thing that you built, and then you have to replace that because now you've almost made them incompatible.\nSo I think it's just really thinking about the full solution that you want to see, and then also, do you have the right resources?\nI think in the age of AI, you know, the top talent is going to places like OpenAI, Google, and so, you know, there are really talented data scientists out there and that can help you build within your company, and we do have some really amazing data scientists.\nUm, but how much can they even build because we have a small percentage of those people?\nSo how much are they building uniquely?\nAre they leveraging other tools?\nSo, I think, I think it's, it's still, um, it's still a ways to, to have, I don't have a perfect answer for that one, but I think every company needs to be wary of, you know, what comes out of the box, I guess, and how much, I, I guess my biggest piece of advice though, is like, is to urge people that do buy something, is really make sure the out of the box, that 80%, maybe really question whoever is asking for that 20% special extra, what's the value of that 20%?\nAnd can you just use the out of the box?\nBecause I would guarantee that that 20% is going to slow you down, and it's going to make it harder to maintain.\nIt's going to make it more complicated in the long run.\nSo, right, just use it out of the box.\nIf you are going to buy it, just use it as is.\nNow, that's an oversimplification, because obviously you will need some special things, um, depending on your business, but lessons learned from some experiences.\nLet's talk about out of the box solutions.\nYou must get a lot of AI pitches.\nTell me a little bit about the process you've developed to separate the signal from the noise.\nI'll give a story first, and it's not a very, it may not be the nicest one about me, but I was in a vendor demo, and about maybe 10 minutes in, I got some slideware, um, and then they started demoing me an HR chatbot, and I feel like I've seen a lot of HR chatbots, as like, here, let us show you what we can create, and I just, I immediately was like, you need to show me something else because this just isn't going to work for me.\nI've seen it.\nI get you can create one, but I need you to show me something different because everyone's pitched that to me.\nSo, I guess that's a roundabout way of saying that I often go into a room with most vendors as being one of the most skeptical people about why are you here?\nWhat are you trying to sell me?\nDo you have something that we really need?\nAre you just putting up some vaporware?\nBut also, I am one of the most optimistic people about the potential of AI and it being transformative.\nSo if you show me something that I, I think could have impact, I will get excited, and I will, you know, try to socialize that across the board, but I get very tired of, you know, seeing things that have sort of, you know, oh, we've made this for somebody else, and, you know, you could use it.\nI'm like, you don't really understand our business.\nSo, one thing is, if somebody's going to, you know, come to a meeting with me and my team, I can pretty much tell, it's sort of like doing a job interview with an intern.\nYeah.\nIf they can't show that they understand your company, they're probably not going to be worth working with.\nSo, if somebody is just spending, you know, 10 minutes just, you know, probing me for, for, for my company, if you haven't done some homework, that's a concern.\nI also heard a story from a co-worker who had gone to this vendor meeting.\nIt's supposed to be an AI workshop, and she got there, was like, \"Okay, what, what are the AI parts?\"\nAnd they literally just told her, \"Oh, it's, it's not really AI.\nWe just, we just called it.\"\nAnd so, you know, I, I, I do think level setting with people.\nI see, I also do this a lot with vendors, is understand the vernacular.\nSo, I see a lot of people using Agentic and agents, and Agentic is still somewhat fuzzy around the edges.\nSo, I'll get into a call, be like, \"What do you mean by agents?\"\nLike, give me your definition, because I'm not saying that like my definition of agent is unchanging and static, but I want to make sure that we're speaking the same language and have the same vernacular when it comes to, you know, approaches and solutions, you know, with AI.\nSo those are some things that I deploy.\nMaybe I don't know.\nIs it mean to tell somebody not to show me an HR chatbot?\nShould I, if you don't need it anymore?\nIf you don't need it, you know, just being honest.\nYeah.\nCan you tell us a little bit about, and you touched on this early earlier in our conversation, uh, about ROI and the importance of ROI when it comes to whether it's a vendor that you're purchasing software from or it's something you're building?\nTell us a little bit about kind of how you think about ROI and if there's a framework that you've developed to assess it.\nSo I think one thing that I am deeply conscious of is, while AI and the models are getting less expensive every day, right?\nSo the, the model cost, you know, gets tenfold decrease in price, you know, fairly rapidly, AI solutions are still very expensive to implement, and not only that, what I'm seeing is that, if, for instance, you have a team that wants to build, let's, let's use an HR chatbot, you know, just as an example, wants to build an HR chatbot, and they get, you know, sold by a vendor, and, you know, they're like, this, we're going to build it for, you know, it's going to be great.\nI'm always making sure people understand that, okay, yes, I understand this will save you time.\nHow much is it going to cost you to build it?\nHow much is it going to cost you to maintain it?\nHow often do you need to, you know, update the model?\nHow easily can you update the model?\nDo you have an ability to move to a lower cost model, but not lose any of the quality?\nYou know, these are all things that like people are still trying to unpack and understand.\nSo I think in terms of mapping it to a framework, I think one, deeply understanding how your business makes money and measures money, measures money, we all measure money with like dollars and cents, but measures value is really important.\nSo like, for instance, like subscriptions are a big part of our business, and so understanding what drives subscription growth, and then subscription growth in terms of equal value, like then you can map a solution directly to those business drivers.\nSo mapping these things really in specifically, or, you know, if there's business functions, like more on the cost savings.\nSo subscriptions might be more of a revenue generating model, right?\nSo that's where you would want to make sure whatever your solution that's driving revenue maps very specifically back to, are we increasing subscription growth, and can we show, show the math, essentially?\nYeah.\nAnd then if you're looking at something that's more cost savings, again, you need to understand the people and the processes behind that to a really specific degree.\nYou need to sit with the teams and and get, get your little calculator out or get your spreadsheet out and say, \"Okay, I've got this amount of people who are who are analyzing this amount of content, or and then that are spending, you know, and they cost x amount to have that, and then to understand with the solutions how you can bring that cost down.\"\nSo, you have to do a pretty intensive mapping to get it right, because I think without that intention, it's just sort of like, like a crystal ball, and you're like, well, I think the, I hope the subscribers will come.\nI hope, I hope the cost savings will come.\nUm, and I think that's, unfortunately, you know, not, not the smartest way to do business, but I think, I think we're all trying to get there.\nYeah.\nLet's talk a little bit about your writing.\nYou write a lot.\nYeah, it's good.\nTell us about how AI shows up in your creative workflow.\nThat's a great question.\nI, I have like all these ideas.\nI feel like I am that person who has like a million thoughts and would, until recently, sort of be like, I want to write a book or I want to write something.\nBut, you know, it, it takes a lot more sit down time, a lot more capacity than I thought I had.\nWith having AI tools at my disposal, I can sort of take like an inkling of a thought, or I do this a lot where I'm listening to an audiobook, and I'm like, \"Oo, I love this quote.\"\nAnd I'll take a quote, and I'll maybe throw it into chat, and I say like, \"I, I really love this,\" and I'll, I'll kind of, um, word vomit like what I'm thinking about or what I'm feeling that this makes me think of, how it excites me, and I'll either like just maybe ask like, hey, draft a LinkedIn post that I might, you know, be able to share this because I just, I want to share this, or I'll, I use it a lot.\nI'm writing a series on organizational intelligence, and so I'll, you know, I'll be driving back from dropping my kids off from school, and I'll use the voice to text, and I'll be like, I just had an idea for a chapter, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, and again, just plop it in as sort of for now, like, like, okay, let me get the ideas out in a space, so JB has come become somewhat of a notepad for me of just all these stray thoughts that I can now figure out how to focus them into an intent or share kind of a little piece of like Nicole's brain or like what I'm reading or what I'm thinking, um, and how I'm seeing and framing the world that I didn't feel like I could as quickly or as elegantly before.\nI still take a lot of time to take that kernel of a thought, you know, put it in chatb, and edit it quite a bit to still have the essence of, you know, what is Nicole?\n\n\nBecause I do, I see people post, there's so much AI slop out there. There's so many LinkedIn posts that are all AI generated, and I believe that, you know, everything I still put out there, whether I used AI to help me, is still my original thought. I had to think about it, listen to it, hear it, put it into an AI chat, and converse back. I often have like several versions that I converse even in a chatbot before I even bring it into like, you know, a word doc and then further refine it, and then I'll put it in LinkedIn. I'll maybe do a final polish. So, it takes a lot to kind of get it there, but it just feels like it gets me there faster. And I have like almost like a friend or a coach or somebody to kind of bounce ideas off that before I felt like I had to sit in my own silence, my vacuum of of Nicole and sort of hear my own echoes and not get further than that little nugget.\n\nYeah. I was going to ask you like the the difference between AI slop and using AI to enable your own creativity. Um, and it sounds like using it, as people have said, as as a thought partner or as a coach. Uh, I'm kind of curious, what does that look like in practice? Are there like some prompts that you use that you could share that help take that nugget and turn it into with a lot of your own perspectives into a, you know, a kind of like high quality content piece?\n\nSo, I use a lot of different things and I use a lot of different features within some of the tools. So, I'll use projects in, you know, chatbt or Claude to kind of set up and give it samples of my own writing that I've done before. I also just I'm a less is more prompter. So, I'll sometimes just, you know, put in a quote, give it some instructions, you know, see what it comes out with. Maybe I like it, maybe I don't. Like, no, you didn't really strike a chord there, or I'll take it offline, I'll edit a little bit, throw it back and be like, and now polish this. So I don't have a one set technique. I will also bounce between tools. So, for instance, I might brainstorm a concept for a chapter in chat dbt. I might do kind of the initial like draft in Claude because I think the writing style is a little better, but then I might go fact check myself in chat GBT because sometimes Claude makes up quotes or it'll make up stories of people or interactions that I've had, and I'm like, no, no, we're not going to do that. Sometimes I'll put it into Substack. I'll do all my edits, throw it back in, you know. So it, and sometimes I'll put in chunks. Sometimes I'll put in a full long form. I don't have like a tried andrue method. I try a lot of different things. Some of them work out sometimes. I I love this one. LinkedIn post, just add some emojis, like, like that's that's one because, you know, I'm just like, yeah, I need it to, you know, look a little different, or I'll I'll you know, ask it, you know, to leave space to call people out, so I'll know kind of where I need to insert because it it can't do some of that, obviously. But yeah, I'm I maybe don't have the most refined approach, but I have fun with it and I I don't take it or myself too seriously.\n\nYeah. I mean, it sounds like the key there is that it's iterative and that it's not just ask and answer and use. It is like ask and take and consume and think and refine and create and ask again and so on and so forth.\n\nYeah. No, I I think that's that's that's a the per.\n\nSo, my perfect piece of advice now that you've really brought this to life is don't take, don't ever take the first draft. Like try at least one more draft. You still might go back to to one of the first ones or take a piece from this, a piece from that, but never, never take the first draft and just post it or or use it on its own because then I do think it loses a bit of the the you or the humanity because you still had to give it the initial prompt to get that that far, but I feel like you got to iterate.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'd love to end with some practical advice, a few questions that hopefully, you know, leverage some of your experiences and learnings. And the first is around product. Um, what's what's one way that product leaders can start using AI meaningfully today if they're not already?\n\nI mean, I think for product leaders, so much of what we do is sort of written discourse, whether it's a email to stakeholders or it's prepping a Strategy deck. I think it goes back to the advice that I just gave on how to prompt is use it as a collaborator. So the same way as you be like, you might have a first draft of an email and you're just like, is this striking the right chord? Throw it into your company approved AI tool and say like, is this giving the right sentiment? Like cross-check yourself, or if you would normally, I remember years ago before I would send like a very important stakeholder email or have to, you know, send something to a cranky stakeholder, I would have like a co-worker like, you know, over my shoulder be like, hey, can you read this one time? So think about it as the same thing, the same way you would work with a colleague to sort of collect, collaborate, or to brainstorm. You can do that now, like imagine, or even use it as your first draft. Use it as your first draft, then take it offline. So I think it's just using it. I think the only other piece of advice I would give is is be skeptical about does this product andor solution um need GenAI? Does it need just a new process? you know, because I do think a lot of people are jumping to must have an AI feature. Don't think that's always the right use case or or the right implementation is to just jump straight to that. So, so be skeptical, but use it all the time. I I feel like I'm giving mixed messages, but in the right way.\n\nYeah. Um, I would love to talk lastly about creativity. Uh, you've used the term AI amplified creativity. Uh, we just spoke to how you use it in your own creative workflow. Do you think AI is changing the definition of creativity itself?\n\nFor me, it is. Um, I have created AI songs with my daughter. We create AI images with characters that she references all the time. I would never have done something that creative or that kind of creative because I'm not an artist. I'm not a song maker, but now I can be. Yeah. I can teach my daughter that, you know, she can be interested in and dabble in a lot of things. I think that's what's been really exciting for me. I feel like I'm always curious um about the world and learning new skills and and different things. And so for me, it gives me an opportunity to sort of like dabble in these things or learn about something that, you know, I was worried would take me too much time, but now, oh look, I can do a deep research report on, you know, what it would be like to move to Spain. Like, okay, like that take a lot of time. I think it is. It's definitely changing what creativity means to me and making me a more kind of renaissance woman in this new modern age of AI.\n\nWhat a great place to end.\nAs promised, thank you Nicole for coming on Just Curious and sharing your perspectives and thoughts and um yeah, I really appreciate it. Enjoyed it. Thanks for having me.\n",
