  "cleanText": "AI is changing everything. How we create, how we learn, even how we think. One of the biggest challenges isn't the technology itself. It's how people adopt and use it. Many organizations focus on efficiency and automation, but there's a much bigger opportunity when we let AI be a tool for exploration and experimentation. To dive into this, I'm joined by Jenny Nicholson, SVP of creative and strategic innovation at Movement Strategy and the founder of Queen of Swords. Jenny spent her career bridging creativity and technology, helping brands and individuals use AI in unexpected ways. She's led experimental AI projects and is deeply passionate about AI's role in education, critical thinking, and human creativity. Jenny, welcome to Just Curious. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Awesome. Excited to have you here. Excited to dig into the intersection of humans and machines. Tell us maybe to start a little bit more about yourself and your focus on AI.\n\nYeah, so I have spent the majority of my career as an advertising creative. I started as a proofreader, became a copywriter, moved my way up to creative director, executive creative director, and in 2022, I went out on my own, um, at first as a freelance creative, and I found my way into AI. I started experimenting at the, I think, summer of 2021 and then just really dove in and started finding myself doing more and more AI-centric work to where now most people think of me as an AI lady, which is a little bit of a hard adjustment because I'm like, no, no, no, I'm a creative person who loves technology, and right now AI is the most interesting thing I could be doing, so that's what I'm doing. If something that comes out tomorrow that is equally as interesting, that's what I'll be paying attention to. And you know, my whole career, I have always loved technology, which is funny because I actually spent a good chunk of my childhood living in the middle of the woods in Tennessee with no electricity or running water. Oh, wow. And so I think it's very funny that I'm like a technology-obsessed person, but what I love about technology is actually, I'm not generally super interested in technology for technology's sake. I'm always interested in how technology changes humans, changes the way we connect with people, changes the way we understand ourselves, changes the way we move through the world. And that's always that sort of feedback loop between technology and humans and each other. And technology and humans and each other is what really has always been interesting to me. Yeah. And I'm really looking forward to diving into how we can use AI in a humanistic way. I'd love to hear a little bit more about your work. So tell me a little bit more about Queen of Swords and movement and what type of work you do and who you do it for. Okay, so Queen of Swords is my independent consultancy and you know when I was working for myself all the time, I was doing both training and building. And I was building complex workflows, building products, AI sort of infused products coming into kind of creative projects for ad agencies and showing them how they could use AI to actually make more interesting creative, make things that they couldn't have made before. I'm really interested in work that lives sort of, it's not quite marketing, it's not quite a product, but it kind of lives in that space in between. And as an example, I did a project with Zola, which is a wedding planning platform. They do this survey every year called the first look report where they basically survey people who got married over the last year and use Zola and they ask them questions about like what basically what sucks the most about wedding planning, what surprised you the most. And one of the things that came out from this was that the single biggest surprise that people have when they're planning a wedding is that they have so many decisions to make. People are not prepared for the number of decisions. And the number one pain point, especially in cisgender, heterosexual partnerships, is the vast majority of those decisions fall on one half of the partnership. I will let the listeners decide which half that is. You know, one of the things we learned, we did a lot of research, went and dug into Reddit, both people in wedding planning, but also tried to find men on Reddit. And what we discovered was it's not that the men don't want to be part of it. They don't know where to start. And also they have just as much as women do this cultural belief that it's the ladies' thing and the best thing that you can do is to stay out of the way. So you have this one group of people who want to be part of it but are but feel like they're not supposed to, like that's not their thing and they shouldn't care. And then you have this other half of the partnership who's like, why am I doing this all by myself? And we said, \"Is there something we could actually do to help that?\" You know, and we knew we couldn't like go messing around in their product when software is your product, like spinning up a new feature is not easy. It's not something you can do lightly. And we said, well, what if we used ChatGPT and a custom GPT as like a testing ground to see what we could do? And we ended up making a tool that's a custom GPT called split the decisions. And it's designed for couples to do together. And you sit down, ask you some questions about your wedding, when, where, about how many people, and ask each of you the same questions. What are three words you would describe, use to describe your feelings about wedding planning? What are you most excited about? What are you most worried about? What do you, what do you the one thing you really want to be part of your wedding? And what do you want people who leave your wedding after the reception to say about the wedding? So, both partners answer that. And then it asks a series of which of you questions. Which of you is most likely to actually enjoy haggling for a good deal? Yeah. Which of you is most likely to have a meltdown over which font to put on the invitations? And it basically asks, I don't know, six or seven of those essentially psychographic questions that don't have anything to do with your gender role or the task, but are about like what you're good at, what your strengths are. And then what it does is it takes all of your answers and divides all the tasks up, all the sort of most common tasks of wedding planning and divides them equally. One person, partner A gets half, partner B gets half, and then there's a group of tasks like picking your efficient that both of you get. Yeah. And then it generates for you a downloadable CSV that has the task, that has the person it's assigned to, and that also has a link to a Zola tool, a Zola article, a Zola resource, or a Zola product that will help you actually pull that off. It's cool. And so for me, that is a the kind of thing that would not have been able to exist without AI. Yeah. And it definitely wouldn't have been able to be something that, you know, myself and one person on the Zola team built it together over the course of a month. Yeah. I was going to ask you, like, so that marketing product that you created using Generative AI took you an individual about a month. Two years ago, how long do you think it would have taken to put something like that together? Two years ago, it probably wouldn't have even happened because, you know, the budget would have been prohibitive. One of the things that I always say is like that kind of work, that thing that is it a product, is it an experience, is it an ad? Like that's always been my passion area. But the problem with that is if I'm trying to sell, if I'm trying to get a client to do a TV commercial, right? You buy, you spend x number of dollars buying space on television or buying banner ads or buying social and you say, \"If I spend this amount of money, I know this number of people will see the thing that I did.\" You can't know whether the thing that they did will actually have the effect that you want, but you know that people will see it. You have at least some certainty. And then when it comes to television commercials, social posts, things like that, you have like focus groups, you have AB testing, you have all these things that you can do that kind of reduce the uncertainty of whether or not this was going to be a good investment, right? Where the kind of things that I like to build something like split the decisions, I don't really have a good way to say this is going to give you X, Y, and Z. Yeah. Right. Because I don't have anything to benchmark it against 'cause it's not really been done before. I don't have, it doesn't come with like a built-in like media plan that you just spend this amount of money, you put it in the bucket, and you know people are going to see it, which is fine. And and I didn't have trouble getting getting companies to understand the value of that. They they understood the creative potential. They understood the relationship potential. They understood why it was a good idea. Yeah. The problem is is that's a lot of uncertainty. Yeah. And then they ask the next question. Do you, I'm assuming you guess what the question they always want to know is, tell us how much is it going to cost? How long it take? And then I have to say, well, it's going to take six months and it's going to cost $125,000.\nYeah. And that's the end of that conversation right there. Yeah. And so now you've created a way to where I can say it's going to take a month and it's going to cost $40,000. Yeah. Yeah. You've reduced $40,000 is enough to be able to say, you know what, that isn't that much of a risk. And what we ended up doing is we launched it as a custom GPT, got a lot of good press coverage over that and also was able to use that thing that we launched as a test to say, is this a product that people are interested in? Is this a product that people would want to talk about? Is this a product that people would use? And then take the learning from that and then use that to decide, is this a product that we want to actually invest in building into our platform proper. And that's what I think becomes really exciting is that you can actually go from idea to thing in the world that people can experience, that they can engage with, that you can learn from. Whether or not it's working for them, whether or not it's compelling to them, whether or not it makes a positive difference in somebody's life, whether or not it has a positive impact on how people think of your company, how people think of your brand without having to go all the way to spending months and months and months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to get that answer. Yeah. If one of the barriers to innovative experimentation is like the cost, this is dramatically reducing it and should lead to an explosion in experimentation. Reminds me actually of how bubbles tend to lead to a lot of innovation in that people have a speculative frenzy. They're much more willing to explore like back in the late '90s, you know, what the future of the internet could look like. Many of those things don't work out, but because the cost is so low, people will like pursue those experiments. And here you have something similar, like if the cost is low enough, there's no reason not to experiment, absent the fact that, of course, people have limited amounts of time. Yeah, exactly. But you know, there are things that, you know, a lot of the things that that I build, like lots of them use AI as part of the thing, but a lot of things that I built are programmatic that don't use AI, but that because I have AI to partner with, I don't have to necessarily have all of the technical knowledge of how to do the programming. I just have to have the idea. I have to have the willingness to try and I have to have the patience to go at the pace that I can go at and the comfort to ask some generative computational entity like, wait, what is that? How do I do that? Where do I find that? And when you're willing to do those things, when you, that's all you need is an idea, patience, and the humility to be able to say, I don't understand, can we go back a step? Wait, what is that? Yeah. Help me understand that. Don't just do it for me. Teach me how you're doing it as we do it. Yeah. That's all you need. That's literally all you need. Yeah. It's a game changer. When it comes to AI, you've told me you think the mainstream narratives around AI are wrong. That people think of LLMs as a automated solution that happens separate from the humans on the team and that's as you said, asked backwards. Uh, tell me, tell me what you mean and what people should be doing. So one of the things that people, when they have a pain that they think that AI can help make that pain go away, the question they have is, is there a tool that does this thing? And often the thing that they're asking for that tool to do is a big thing. It's a an entire job. And what I always say is, I'm like, no, there is not a platform, and thank God there's not, because if there were, that would be kind of scary. But what happens is people have this mindset where it's like, I either do it myself or I get an AI that does the whole thing for me. Yeah. And they end up spending all their time evaluating platforms, looking at tools, like researching software as a service providers, doing demos instead of saying, like, okay, I could do this big tool, but I don't really understand this technology very much. What if I just use the tools that are available to everybody to better understand how this technology can support me? Not in the whole picture, but if I can instead of getting it to 100% of one thing, right? That's what everybody does. Like I want it to do 100% of this part of my job, where I'm like, \"No, no, no. I just use it to help me do everything that I do or everything that I'm not good at doing five times faster than I could do it by myself. And so I don't have any one thing where I'm like, this is my AI thing. I just raise the bar on everything that I do, especially on the places where I'm not strong so that I in in general get better and faster. Like I don't have, I will never publish something that AI has written for me because I'm a writer. Yeah. Why would I have AI write something for me when it can never write anything that's going to be as good as that I would write? And also, like writing is my identity and giving that up is not something that I would want to give up. But I'm not a software developer. I'm not a like expert in all kinds of random domains. But I can ask questions about all those domains that make me smarter about what\n\n\nI'm writing about. Yeah, that use and those aspirations are driven by experimentation, your individual experimentation. One of the other mainstream narratives is around AI adoption, that it's within enterprise, not high, and you said as well that, um, adoption is not driven by task force. It's not a kind of top-down mandate. It's really about individual experimentation. Why do you think organizations struggle with this?\n\nBecause that's how organizations have always worked, you know, and also because it's scary. And it's scary to say, \"Oh, wait. We're going to give this to our frontline day-to-day employees and give them the freedom, the permission, and the training to figure out how to make it work for them.\" That requires a level of trust and a level of sort of holding on loosely that I don't think comes naturally to most companies. Most companies are like, \"Okay, this new thing is coming. We got to get a group of like our IT people and our legal people together and our like tech ops people and we're going to come up with a plan and we're going to research all the tools and we're going to find the best tool and we're going to have them like make something just for us and like that's going to be the way.\" And then you make this thing that's like your thing that then you have to get people to use. But you built a thing that isn't necessarily like most the the truth of most organizations is the people in charge of the organization don't really actually understand what it's like to do the actual work, right? So at movement strategy, like the CEO doesn't know what a junior content strategist does all day. Like if the CEO really knew the pain points of the junior content strategist, they wouldn't be able to be a CEO, right? They've got bigger things that they're working on.\n\nFor people in sort of leadership to sort of pick the tool and how to use the tool that's supposed to meet the needs of everybody when what AI is, and when I say AI, I'm specifically speaking right now about large language models, when it is essentially a polymorphic technology that it shapes itself to the needs of the user. So, one of the things that I always say is instead of using software as a service, right? It's not like picking a like like picking between smart sheet in a sauna and like monday.com. It's not like that. It's like giving people pencils, right? You wouldn't be like, \"Hello, we have we have like in some ways a large language model is like a pencil, right? Just like a pencil is a tool that has some fundamental things that are consistent, but the way that pencil is used is entirely dependent on the person who's using the pencil. And you don't you're not born knowing how to use a pencil, right? You don't come out of the womb knowing how to use a pencil. You have to learn. You have to learn how to sharpen it. You have to learn how to hold it. You have to learn what happens if you press down too hard. What happens if you don't press down hard enough? You have to understand the eraser. You have to understand that sometimes when you try to erase it smears around everywhere. Like those are things that you can only.\" But like once you understand how the pencil works, you can use the pencil for whatever the hell you want. And the way I see it is I'm like, you know who has a really good idea about what would make the junior content strategist job better? Yeah. The junior content strategist. Yeah. So instead of being like, \"We're going to buy a platform tool that you all have to use that is made with people who don't do your job all day long, who don't know what hurts, who don't know what you would love to have, who don't know where you're weak, who don't know where you're strong, because all of us are different.\" Like, what if instead of that we said, \"We're going to teach you all how to use a pencil. We're going to give you all access to a pencil and we're going to encourage you and we're going to incentivize you not to use this particular branded pencil that's blue with orange stripes and somebody put a little like you know those like weird little pencil grip things on it which I don't really like. We're not going to do that. We're just going to give you a pencil. We're going to say use this tool to make yourself 20% more badass in whatever way you see fit. Which one of those is going to lead to more innovation? Which one of those is going to lead to more breakthroughs? And it's not you have to make yourself 20% more badass to meet your OKR. It's we're going to incentivize you to be 20% more badass.\n\nYeah. How do you not just you have to teach, you have to make the technology accessible, right? You have to teach people how to use it and you have to incentivize them to share what they are doing and learning. Without those three things, you will not have adoption. Yeah. Because if you're in task force land trying to find the right tool, making some bespoke thing, it's like no, everybody's already using ChatGPT on their personal accounts anyways. If you block it on their your computer, their computers, they're using it on their phone. So just go get people a bunch of seats on ChatGPT team, which is designed for companies, which is designed to not train on your data. So the data security thing is gone. They can make custom GPTs that they can share with other people and then incentivize them for doing it. Celebrate them for doing it. Bonus them for doing it.\n\nYeah. What have you seen that look like in practice? And maybe I'll just play back what you what you said first. It's about giving people access to pencils and so that could be ChatGPT teams seats where they have a space to play around and learn. Two, it's about I guess learning how to use the pencil. So that I guess is some form of upskilling training program. And three is uh incentives, um, which could be recognizing them and it could be moni, mon, you know, uh, monetary and uh, and so what does what does that look like in in practice, like what what have you seen like work in terms of a kind of three-point plan like that? So I think Maderna is a really, really good example. So Maderna uses ChatGPT enterprise and that's what they're using as their platform and there are some amazing case studies of it. So I'm like it's not that like ChatGPT is for little rinky dinky companies and if you're going to be a real enterprise you need and there are a lot of people right now trying to sell people on that, trying to sell companies on like you need an enterprise solution blah blah blah blah blah, like where most of them are just they have some handy dandy layers floating on top of one of the like on top of the GPT model anyways. So there's a lot of noise from people who are incentivized to try to sell you a special product that kind of makes decision makers maybe think like, oh, this isn't the best thing, then you have a lot of our existing products trying to like build AI into it, right? So now every single time I open Google docs, Gemini is like, want me to help you write that? And I'm like, no, like which means that that that as users we're getting pushed like further and further away from the technology and so it's hard to evaluate a technology, technology that you don't understand its strengths and weaknesses. So if somebody comes to try to sell you a SL platform, if you don't understand what ChatGPT is really deeply capable of, you're not going to be able to say, is this actually a truly amazing solution that we should invest in buying or is this something that's actually just one or two layers deep that now that we have a better understanding of this technology, we could probably build it ourselves. Right. Right. But if you don't have the basic understanding of what it is in its most sort of fundamental form, how can you evaluate? And then on the sort of incentivizing side, it's like access. People are already using CHABT in their life. So why not have them using it for work where they're already most comfortable using it? Yeah. Then on the knowing side, not only does it make them better at using the technology if you train them how to use HBT, they also get more savvy about evaluating the millions of sale pitches that every company is getting barried with from SAS vendors selling bespoke solutions. And then thirdly, on the incentivizing side, one of the things that is very real is that even advanced people, there is this feeling that I feel like I'm cheating. I feel like I'm getting away with something. I feel like if I tell my company what I'm doing, they're going to give me tons more work. They're going to ask me what I'm doing all day. They're going to be like, \"Oh, if you can use AI to do this, you can replace me.\" And so, there's a psychological factor that keeps even the people who are using it maybe at more advanced levels in your company than you would know. They have no incentive or motivation to be public, honest, and open about the use that they're doing, about what they're doing, which means nobody else in the organization can learn from them.\n\nYeah. How do you give them that permission just explicitly like you know, we we we want you to become more efficient. We want you to use these tools more and we're going to you know, reward you in some way for sharing your perspectives for achieving a better efficiency. We're not going to punish you for using a tool that makes you better that it cannot be. So here's what happens. Most companies make like using AI and OKR, right? They make it something that you have to do. They make it something you have to do. And right now, so many people in the world are looking at this technology and they're coming at it from a place of fear, which is so understandable because it's weird. Excuse my language. Like, this is a very different thing. Like I like to say, you know, you can talk about what it is, you can talk about how you use it, but you cannot escape the fact that for the first time in all of history, there is an entity, multiple entities that manipulate language as well or better than we do with meaning that it can say something to me that I understand and I can say something back to it. And the thing that I say back to it, it is able to respond to that in a way that suggests that the meaning I intended was received and returned back to me. Yeah. Yeah. That is incredibly amazing. And B, it's existentially it's existent. It's existential. So there's this existential layer of fear. Yeah. Right. Where it's like what does it mean to be human? Like what who am I? Like there is this like very deep feeling. Not to mention that we've all been trained on generations of movies where the way it ends is we all get killed except for one brave human goes into the belly of the machine and blows it up. Like so we don't exactly have an existential good relationship with technology. Yeah. Then you get to the like professional side where every day on LinkedIn you see you're not AI is not going to take your job. Somebody who's using AI will. But then you see companies being like we've slashed 6,000 positions because we're replacing them with AI. We see news articles all the time that are like 60% of white collar jobs are going to be replaced by AI. So you've got somebody who's now a huge group of people who are existentially afraid, who are afraid for their livelihoods. And oh, by the way, you still have to do your regular job. So you have to find time to learn this new thing which might take your job and also might kill you, but have fun. Let's party. Also, your job is expecting you to do it because they're like, \"We have to keep up and be competitive.\" And so then it becomes this thing that you have to do to stay competitive to protect your livelihood even though it makes you feel existentially uncomfortable. Like, do those sound like good conditions for experimentation? No. Sounds like a challenge. Where if it's like, hey, this technology is coming. We as an organization see that the best use case and the biggest potential of this is to help you do what you do well even better and to help you have more help so that you don't have to do all the things that you do so grindingly all the time all alone.\n\nYeah. How do you think about that in the context of creative industries where you spend a lot of time where the the existential threat feels real and also uh nearer term? And I think it's like so part of my experience is in creative industries. I'm a creative person. So the first thing that I do when I sit down with this technology is I'm like what can I do with it that's not in the manual? Yeah. And that's one of the things that's that's got me to this idea that this mainstream narrative is backwards. I'll get I got there eventually. is backwards because it's all about efficiency. It's all about productivity. It's all about how can we do what we're doing faster, cheaper, and with fewer humans. Like we have the this new polymorphic technology that is the first time something like this has been available to any of us in the world that can actually manipulate language with meaning. And what we're doing is being like, how do we use it to do what we're already doing faster? Yeah, that's how we're using it. Where the way I like to think about it is I like to think about a large language model as like at the same time it is it is a book, it is a library, it is a librarian all at once. Yeah. And I can wander through the library and look at any particular book, but also the book is a librarian. So it can tell me what other books I might like. Yeah. So for example, if I'm working on, um, you know, I work in advertising, so I'll just use a that's a metaphor that's relevant to me. I'm working on a brief, right? Where I'm like, okay, our business problem is this. The people we're trying to reach is this, and the thing we really want them to know about us is this, right? Most people's tendency is to go in and be like, give me a brief for this business problem talking to this audience that the main takeaway is this, right? And they get a brief and it's going to be a shitty brief cuz the model doesn't know. It's giving you literally the most likely thing that you would get. And part of being a creative person, but also part of being a business person in general, is you're not looking for the thing\n\n\nThat everybody says.\nYou're looking for the thing that nobody has seen yet, the thing that nobody has looked for yet, the thing that nobody has found yet.\nAnd just asking it to give you the thing, it's going to give you the most likely thing, because that's what they are.\nThey predict the next most likely word that's going to come out.\nSo if you say give me a brief, it's like here's the most likely thing where I'm looking not for that.\nSo what I will say is, I will say, okay, I have a here's the business problem, here's a brand, here's the audience we're trying to reach, here's the kind of the like thing we want them to understand.\nI'll say, what are 10 strategic frameworks that I can use that would help me approach this challenge?\nAnd the model will be like, certainly, if you use the design thinking framework, it would frame the challenge like this.\nIf you use the like blue ocean framework, it would frame the challenge like this.\nIf you use the jobs to be done framework, it would frame the challenge like this.\nSo now, even if I, even if I walk away and don't do a single thing other than that, I, Jenny Nicholson, human being, just learned something, right?\nBecause I will often see three strategic frameworks that I never heard of.\nYeah.\nAnd okay, like I could have, even if the seven ones I heard of, right?\nI could have sat down and been like, okay, if I was looking at this from the design thinking framework, like how would I frame it?\nIf I was looking at like, would I do that?\nProbably not, because we all have our like little paths that we like to go down.\nAnd so then not only like have I learned something, but then I can keep going.\nI can say, you know what, this little one element from the design thinking framework is really interesting to me, and this little element from the jobs to be done framework is really interesting to me, and this little element from this other framework is really interesting to me.\nWhat things, information, or perspectives from domains that have nothing to do with strategy, given these three that I've picked, are interesting to me, might also be really valuable to me.\nYeah.\nAnd the model will be like, okay, here you go.\nAnd then I'm like, okay, now that we know all of this stuff, I thought this was interesting, that was interesting, this is interesting.\nI'll be like, now let's make a strategic framework that uses what's great about each of these things, but is like better and more powerful than any of them, that is greater than the sum of its parts.\nAnd the model's like, certainly.\nAnd then I'm like, okay, if we looked at our challenge, so go back to our challenge that we made that I shared with you at the beginning.\nIf we take that challenge and we look at that challenge through the strategic framework that we talked about, what kind of brief comes out?\nYeah.\nSuch a great example of how different ways to use these tools are going to come back with completely different results.\nAnd that maybe seem like obvious, you know, garbage in, garbage out, but most people just assume put in the query and I'm going to get the answer.\nAnd you know, to your point, like that's not how a probabilistic system works.\nYeah.\nAnd it's also not, not, it's not great for the analog that you've shared with the librarian and the library, you know.\nIt's basically like going into the library, looking at like the the first thing there and then leaving, versus like asking someone to help you find the book, you know, uh, based on what's in the book to find another book, to then take that information in both the books and like put it in a space that you can then like riff on it.\nLike those are, yeah, those are just, you know, easy things to do, but not easy to remember to do them if you haven't done them before.\nExactly.\nAnd so when I build these like big workflows, and I have built big workflows where you put in your like, you put in the initial inputs and then you get this big, beautiful thing at the end.\nThe reason that that works is not because of my prompt engineering expertise.\nThat's partly why it works.\nBut the other thing is because I have been strategic, creative for 20 years, and so I know what a good output looks like.\nAnd a lot of the work that I'm doing on the prompt engineering side is saying, okay, is like, let me try this, is that a good output?\nI'm like, that's not a great output, let me go back in, let me tweak it to get it closer to an output I want.\nOkay, now that's great, let me see if I try 50 different inputs and input combinations, is it still going to give me 50 great outputs?\nAnd so what people are paying for in that case, when they're paying for a solution, they're not buying the AI, an AI-powered solution that really has valuable inputs, has outputs, has valuable outputs, because I have encoded my own thinking and my own process and my own perspective in it.\nAnd so anything that you buy, even an autonomous agent, some human has to tell that autonomous agent why it's there, what its job is, what its purpose is, where it's going.\nSo, there is no magical AI box that is going to solve all of our problems.\nYeah, it ties back to your comment from earlier about who's going to know how best to use this tool.\nYou know, it's going to be the um, I can't remember what the role was.\nJunior creative director, junior content strategist, or like the finance person who knows how to use it for finance.\nYeah.\nThe person who actually needs it to do their job better, maybe more efficiently, probably in a higher quality way.\nThat's the person who knows, not the center of excellence.\nYeah.\nSo it's like, so, so much focus on automation, on efficiency.\nEfficiency is an automation conversation.\nAnd what happens is automation and AI keep getting jammed together.\nYeah.\nWhere when people say AI, what they're really talking about is automation.\nYeah.\nAnd then the automation is what scares people.\nYeah.\nAutomation.\nAnd so we have to separate those out.\nWhat's that?\nI said automation tends to mean no people.\nUh, that's exactly what automation means, right?\nThat's literally what automation means.\nAnd so if AI gets conflated with automation, then people end up rejecting the whole thing, not realizing that there's a part of it that could actually really be super valuable to them.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWhat, what, um, I guess lastly, um, you know, for companies, whether they are creative, uh, or not, um, and all companies, I guess, are creative in some ways, but if you had to give one piece of advice to companies that are looking to introduce AI into their teams, what would it be?\nI would say stop focusing on the technology and instead pay attention to the people.\nHow do you create a culture of experimentation?\nWho are the people in your company who have always been the ones who are most likely to experiment with something?\nIt's not usually the tech ops people, like instead of being like, who are the tech people, because when you think about it as technology, of course you're going to go ask the tech people, but this isn't, it's made of words, like it is a, it is computational in how it operates, but in the experience of using it is conversational, it's relational, it's made of words, so the tech people aren't necessarily the ones who have the best understanding of how you can use it.\nAnd if you don't take the time to understand that what's keeping people from adopting it and what's keeping people from talking about adopting it doesn't really have much to do with the technology.\nIt has to do with like the very human side of things.\nLike it's just not going to happen because most people are sitting there being like, why would I get excited about something that everything that I'm seeing tells me is just me training the thing that's going to replace me.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nLike unless you help people shift to a mindset where they say, \"Wow, I didn't know this was possible.\"\nUntil you say, \"Hey, we want you to figure out what's possible.\nWe know that figuring out what's possible takes time.\"\nThat it takes time that has to happen on top of the job you do all day.\nTherefore, we are going to reward you for doing it.\nThat changes the relationship between the employee and the organization.\nIt changes the emotional tenor of why they would learn, because then you're not learning from fear, you're learning from opportunity.\nAnd one of the things that as a creative person has always been true in my career is I have never once made anything good when I was afraid.\nNever once.\nWhat a good place to end.\nJenny, I really appreciate you coming by.\nJust Curious and sharing your thoughts on humans and AI and how to not live in fear.\nThank you.\nHope it was helpful.\nYeah.\nThanks.\n",
