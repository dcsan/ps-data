  "cleanText": "Let's walk through an example of that.\nUh, you mentioned to me earlier, uh, work that you've been doing with a rental services company.\nI'd love to share that story.\nWhat problem they came to you with, and then how you went about building them an agentic solution.\nSo, so, who came to you and, uh, what was the problem?\nYeah.\nSo, it's a, it's a local equipment rental business.\nThe, they rent heavy equipment, um, you know, skid steers, excavators, floor sanders, you know, to a mix of construction companies that are, that are doing things as well as the, the general public.\nSo, as you might imagine, they get tons of inquiries, right?\nInquiries around availability, inquiries around pricing, what they, what they do and don't rent.\nSo, a lot of those calls are coming in and distracting from the rest of the business, right?\nRunning, running the operations, dispatching equipment, dealing with problems, fixing and maintaining equipment.\nThey run a relatively small staff.\nSo, the, the owner of the business has to field a lot of those calls.\nAnd his challenge was twofold.\nOne, he, he struggled to give the same level of customer service and the ability to try to solve customers' problems and and get them the information in a very customer-centric way by just taking someone off of their post and having them answer the phones.\nSo, he always saw a, a degrading quality if he wasn't the one doing the job.\nAnd he then had all of the other things he needs to do in the business suffer because he's always taking all the phone calls, right?\nSo, his goal was quite clearly just to reduce the number of things he had to answer every day if it was a price quote or if it was just an answer.\nDo you have this if, if it's available?\nThat was his main goal.\nTherefore, he could free up his time to deal more intimately with customers who had problems, to help his staff from managing the the fleet of equipment and, uh, and the rest of the business.\nSo, that was the problem we set out to solve.\nWhat we built was based off of our framework.\nWe, we trained an agent to know all of his pricing and all of his pricing policies, right?\nSo, he's got some unique ways he prices and, you know, a very customer-friendly way to extend a rental and things like that as well as delivery policies, you know, how far, how much, etc.\nSo, we had to train our agent on all of those, uh, you know, different elements of his business.\nUm, and then it would take phone calls for him, right?\nSo, that's, that's what, uh, that's what it was deployed to do.\nIt's mainly going to give pricing and take bookings.\nUm, but he, he sees the opportunity to expand that to potentially, you know, dispatching for dropping off equipment, picking up equipment in the future and additional benefits.\nYeah.\nHow do you, how do you train an agent like that?\nUm, so what, what sorts of information does it have to ingest to be able to stimulate, to replicate the experience of talking to the owner of a business?\nThe owner of a business who presumably has been doing this for a long time and is an expert really in his business.\nHow, how do you train that agent?\nWhat, what sort of things do you feed it to give it, um, confidence and information to respond to questions?\nSo, probably one of the biggest challenges was exactly that, right?\nSo, we could get it 70% of the way there just from data that he had, right?\nHe had, he had data on his website.\nHe had, you know, his pricing policy was clear.\nHe had the price per, you know, um, piece of equipment per, per duration of rental.\nSo, we could get a lot of that to ingest it into, um, into answering questions just based off of that data.\nAnd it would give that coupled with the knowledge that's in a large language model, right?\nAnd of course, we had to give it guardrails.\nSo, it wasn't making things up or finding something on the internet and just answering the question with something that wasn't true and hallucinating.\nSo, we had to narrow it down based off of the data that we had about his business as well as just what the LLM can infer from knowledge.\nBut that only got it maybe 70% of the way there.\nThe other 30% was a real difficult piece, and that'll be iterative.\nUm, but that was extracting all of the 20-plus years of knowledge, right?\nAnd things he would just intrinsically know and say on a call, um, because he is who he is and what he's done for so long, and, and the agent would have no way of knowing that because it's not written down and it's just his way of working.\nUm, so that was the biggest challenge because, you know, he's a busy guy and having him call and and test during testing and training to give us feedback is, is something he had to free up his time to do.\nAnd then the, the way to get that information out, it's not like it was a document he just didn't give us, right?\nIt was knowledge and it was in his head.\nSo, we actually came up with a creative solution for that.\nWhereas during training, he could call and have a conversation like he was a customer.\nBut if the agent ever went and did something he didn't want it to, and, you know, it answered a question the way it didn't want, he didn't want it to.\nWe actually built in kind of like a keyword he could say which would take the agent out of \"I'm a rental agent solving your problems\" into \"I'm just listening now to how you want me to behave,\" and that would give, that would give him ability to dictate to it what exactly he would say, right?\nSo, now this is how I would handle the solution or the situation in, in, uh, in that scenario, and then we would get that notes and our development team could incorporate that back into the behavior, maybe that was changing the prompt, right?\nMaybe it was, you know, we were getting pricing wrong or, uh, it had read into something from the data and that, that happened a few times, like, uh, you know, it doesn't rent painting equipment, doesn't rent paint sprayers or any of those things, but one of the descriptions of a different piece of equipment, I think it was a pressure washer, had something that confused the agent, right?\nSo, he started asking questions and, you know, kind of broke in and said, \"Wait a minute, I don't rent this stuff, how are you getting that?\"\nSo, we had to figure out from what the model was responding with from our, our, our RAG database as to what it was getting and why it thought that it rented something it didn't.\nAnd that allowed us to kind of correct the behavior and get back on, on track.\nSo, that was a bit of an innovative thing that we built into the process for him in order to make it easy for him to, to help us train.\nHow does this integrate into his existing business and, um, DNF stack?\nYeah.\nSo, a little bit of challenges around that just because the software that he was on from a call it a backend product doesn't expose a lot.\nSo, we originally just gave him a very clean way to then take the, the rental information that the c, the customer wanted and input it.\nThat was the first kind of phase.\nThe second phase is to integrate with QuickBooks for him because that's what he uses in the background and they've got a more robust API.\nUh, so we're going to leverage that for a lot of the things that we can then pull from an inventory perspective and data and customer information.\nSo, that's where we're pulling customer information and, um, updating customer information.\nWe're leveraging QuickBooks from that perspective because his other tool didn't have it and he already has a synchronization between those two.\nYeah.\nWas there any skepticism on his part about the potential for AI and agents to, um, kind of replicate him before you began and like, how, how does he feel about it now?\nYeah, there's definitely some skepticism because he's, he's again, he's a very vibrant individual, right?\nHe's always, he's outgoing.\nHe's very engaging, right?\nSo, he, he wanted to really have a digital twin of himself.\nAnd we didn't set out to digitize his personality, right?\nWhat we, what we wanted to do was create something that could offload the work and do it in a very professional way and not sound, you know, like a robot to its end customers.\nSo, the, the voice that we chose, right, from a engagement perspective was part of that.\nThe speed with which it talks and some of the, the, the ways it is engages is in some of that.\nSo, he was a bit skeptical at first partly because, you know, he is who he is from a personality perspective, but also we just, we had to temper that a little bit and say like that we're not trying to recreate you from a personality perspective.\nWe're trying to recreate what you're doing in your business.\nUm, so we set expectations a little bit from that perspective.\nUh, and then once we got the first kind of MVP up and he could have a bit of a conversation, just ask questions about equipment, um, he was actually pleasantly surprised because it's just knowledgeable, knowledgeable about what he has and, um, what it could be used for and and whatnot.\nUm, and then we had to iterate and fine-tune on the various permutations and combinations of equipment, right, to, to make it feel more like he would naturally engage.\nBut once we got it to that level, I think, uh, you know, it got him to a point where he was confident it could at least engage, uh, and and take a a good portion of of calls and answer, you know, a lot of questions that people had.\nOf course, we still need to give the customers a way that they can escalate.\nHe can talk to them individually and answer questions if, if the agent can't get it.\nAnd we anticipate that also improving over time, right?\nGive it a year worth of training and and back and forth and it'll be better than it is on launch.\nYeah.\nAnd my understanding this is recently deployed.\nSo, not all the numbers are in, but previously he was spending all his time doing customer service-related calls.\nWhat does the kind of after state look like in terms of what his week is like now?\nYeah, you're, you're right.\nWe're, we're early days.\nUm, it's kind of a phased rollout.\nSo, it's not, it's not being asked to take 100% of his workload in the beginning here.\nSo, before deployment, he was, yeah, on the phone all the time.\nProbably 70% of his day was on the phone either answering questions or taking new bookings or dealing with an issue of of a rental.\nSo, the out-of-the-gate numbers were, we're anticipating tracking that towards 50% of his calls, which mainly is going to be the bookings and pricing inquiries and do you rent this equipment or that equipment.\nWe fully anticipate that he's still going to handle customer issues where they've had a problem, the machine can't start, they had an accident, right?\nThose types of scenarios, we fully anticipate him still engaging, and that's where he's going to spend his time on the phone.\nBut those low-hanging fruit from a, from a customer inquiry or booking, we anticipate taking those calls.\nSo, probably about half of his total calls and 70% of his time was on call.\nSo, you're talking about potentially freeing up 35% of his time.\nYep.\nAnd tell me a little bit about the role of the managed service part of the business here.\nUm, what, what, what, what are you doing with him on an ongoing basis to ensure this works and scales and delivers that value?\nYeah.\nSo, as part of the ongoing service, so first of all, we give him visibility into what's going on.\nSo, we have a, a portal that has access into view all the calls.\nIt analyzes sentiment of the call.\nSo, he, he can flag up if there was a call that was a negative sentiment, and he can follow up with the customer if need be, or he can listen to the call or read the transcript and then give us feedback and say, \"Hey, this is, this is behavior we need to correct.\"\nSo, the service is really to provide him the visibility into what's going on and then work with him to correct anything where the behavior isn't what he wants.\nSo, then he gets the product that he wants long term, right?\nIn addition to that kind of visibility and ability to see what the agent's doing, that human oversight, we also have some effort for him to tune it.\nSo, for example, you know, dispatching is something he, he thinks it might do in the future.\nWell, if, if that dispatch is as simple as saying, \"Hey, this order is in and we can read his backend financial system and it's due out tomorrow, right?\"\nAt the end of the day, the agent could go through all of the things that are due to be delivered tomorrow and it could go and make a phone call or a text message to the drivers to go and say, \"Hey, here's your, your schedule for the day.\"\nSo, building those additional functionalities in over time is another element of the the managed service too.\nSo, it's going to continue to grow and add value to his business.\n",
