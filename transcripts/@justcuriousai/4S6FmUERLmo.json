  "cleanText": "Welcome to Just Curious.\nToday I'm joined by Juan Alfageme, an AI strategist at Deote who's helping enterprises bridge the gap between AI hype and execution.\nWith a background in industrial engineering and experience in data pipelines, AI strategy, and enterprise consulting, Juan blends technical expertise with business acumen.\nHe's developed and deployed AI strategies for major banks, energy companies, and global enterprises.\nToday, we'll talk about what it takes to build a strategic AI roadmap, how to identify high impact use cases, and why successful AI adoption is as much about change management as it is about the technology.\nJuan, welcome to Just Curious.\nThank you for inviting me to this interview.\nYeah, of course.\nCan you tell us a little bit more about your focus on AI within Deote?\nYeah, in Deoid as an AI strategy consultant, we focus on bridging the gap between technology and impact.\nSo we try to focus on how a strategy will help maximize AI impact return and the ROI in such a big ecosystem as AI is right now.\nWhat's the first thing you do when a company asks where should we start with AI?\nOkay, so firstly we got to see where our client is at.\nSometimes our client wants to start building genai use cases but they still don't have even a data governance team that can help them extract, analyze and maximize their data.\nSo it's the main part and the first part to see their AI maturity.\nWe usually do a AI maturity assessment to be able to identify where we at and the gap we need to bridge.\nWhat does that assessment look like?\nWhat inputs do you take into account when you're helping someone understand if they're ready or not?\nOkay, we usually take the data part, see how our client is connecting their their data, how are they extracting it, where are they loading it, and how are they using it.\nAnd secondly, we take a look at their technology stack.\nSee their technology maturity.\nSee if they have the technology stack to be able to implement big Gen AI use cases or they still have like a big gap and we need to work on this technology architecture before moving on.\nand also in the management change to see how the their employees are within AI, how much do they know about AI and what kind of workshops or or how can we try to make this change management plan for them to maximize the the use cases we will implement in the future.\nWhen it comes to data, for someone who's listening to this and wondering whether their data is ready for an AI strategy, what are the considerations that come into play when evaluating whether data is clean and organized and ready to be ingested by a potential solution?\nMainly right now the main pipeline it's called ELT.\nIt can also be ETL.\nIt stands for extract, load and transform.\nOkay.\nSo, you got to be able to extract the data from whatever your activity is.\nIf you're a bank, you need to be able to extract all the payments your clients make each day.\nAnd after extracting all the data in real time, you got to be able to load it into your databases to be able to have it correctly structure over there.\nAnd then you need to or it's easier if you are able to transform the data that it's already loaded in your database.\nSo it's easier for AI to work on that.\nWe've just seen the MCP protocol that open AAI just adopt from cloud and that's a big example on how data and structuring data will accelerate AI adoption and what and how AI will maximize it impact through data.\nHow much does that change how much work needs to be done with regards to structuring your data?\nExactly.\nWell, the MCP protocol, for example, it's a really good example because it shows you how just by having a a type of guidelines on how to extract or use an a specific type of data will help the whole enterprise to know okay this our data for our client part it's built this way.\nIt's a it's a structure in a protocol way following these guidelines.\nSo every time we deploy a use case and we need to call external data for what could be on ra similar where you need external context for for an answer you know how to call how to communicate with this database and it's much easier because you don't need to do um a a specific use case communication with our databases for each different use case.\nMany uh many leaders believe AI can solve everything, but it's rarely true.\nHow do you help companies separate real opportunities from pipe dreams?\nYeah, that's mainly one of our biggest challenge right now cuz uh a lot of people don't know what really what AI is or what Gen AI is cuz you start seeing in social media and you think Gen AI can do everything, but it's really hard to know exactly what they can do.\nThat's what our expertise brings on.\nWe usually for identifying use cases, we can usually do workshops with the employees to see what their other their needs are in their specific in their specific job.\nAnd then with our expertise, we'll try to convert from their necessities to an AI use case impact.\nSo we are the ones that by our expertise are separating these alunizations and these desires AI with real use cases.\nYeah.\nYou've talked about a prioritization matrix.\nCan you walk us through that process and what goes into evaluating value and feasibility?\nExactly.\nThat will be the second step of identifying use cases which is one of the main parts of our strategic offering.\nSo after these workshops I've mentioned we have a usually a long long list of use cases and we need to see what the real impact is of each use case.\nSo what we usually do is we try to build parame parameterization matrix which has as you said two axis it has impact in in and value in the business and physibility.\nSo for impact in the business, we usually take a look at what's the initial investment that needs to be made to deploy this use case.\nWhat's the cost of scaling this use case in the future?\nWhat's the efficiency that this use case will bring?\nAnd how will this um how will this make an impact on the on the OPEX in in our business?\nAnd then we will take a look at new incomes that this use case may bring, new clients, uh new business lines, whatever.\nAnd then we'll take a look at non-tangible incomes like being more h having a a better look as a company cuz you're more echofriendly for example.\nOkay.\nHow can that impact?\nAnd this matrix has weights which are parametricized with our client.\nSo if our client's strategic plan is focusing in reducing cost or being more echofriendly, we will have these criterias have a bigger weight on our matrix so that our usea our prioritized use cases are the ones that will feed with their strategic plans.\nSo same thing goes with visibility.\nWe take a look at the data needed for the use case and the gap we need to close between what what the company has with their data right now and what they need of data for this use case their technology stack the implementation cost.\nSo we take a look at how much it's it's going to cost in effort and therefore time and money to deploy this use case.\nNot all not all AI use cases are the same.\nThere are simple use cases.\nThere are big use cases and there are really complex use cases.\nSo we take a look at the effort we need to well the the company needs is going to need to do in order to deploy this use case and we take a look at all the regulations okay as part of physibility.\nIt's not the same if you're in an specific area with a lot of regulations followed by different axs that are going on in in the different regions.\nIt's not the same US then it's in Europe then it's in China for example.\nSo we take a look at like are are this use case it's going to have this impact in in the business but is it really worth it?\nHow how much is it worth it?\nSo that's where we leverage the the visibility to try and weigh things up and see if it makes sense or not or like which ones are the best fitted for now.\nYeah.\nAnd that's how we prioritize this this matrix cuz maybe you have a really really good use case which it just isn't for now.\nMaybe the gap you need to bridge for you to deploy that use case is really big and will will make a really big economic effort for the company to to deploy that that use case.\nBut maybe in a in a six month when your technology stack it's more mature.\nIt's a it's a really interesting use case cuz that use case in the in the impact th in the impact criteria was a use case that we saw it has a really big roy really easy payback or really good net value.\nSo that's the way we prioritize and we are able to not leave them behind not forget those use cases but still have them in our watch list.\nSo if in the future, you know, the technology stack, the data, it probably gets more mature in the in our in our client.\nSo we're going to be able to remake the framework and be able to see if it's fitted for for deploying in the future.\nYeah.\nYou mentioned this is the second step in a process.\nI'd love to walk through the entire process and maybe use an example.\nYou recently helped a Spanish bank define its AI strategy.\nCan you walk us through how you structured that engagement from identification of use case through the development of MVPs or PC's?\nYeah.\nOkay.\nfirst strategy and in and use cases what we're talking about right now it's a big pilot out of the whole like AI governance we can call which has also this technology stack and and see how the maturity assessment of all the technology parts has some change management plan we've talked about before and has other pilots that we can talk about after but focusing on AI strategy and use cases what we usually do is it depends on the scope of the project but We can either go with an initial long list of use cases if the if the client is willing to just prioritize our knowledge, our use cases knowledge or we can have workshops.\nSo we can we can go with some stakeholders from for the company and okay what are your your main problems in your in your day-to-day?\nWhat are your necessities?\nAnd out of all these conversations, we were able to build to build this long list of use cases we've talked about before.\nSo this first um step can either be from a scratch and trying to convert what the employees need to use case or can either be just start with our knowledge and give a 100 use case long list to work with.\nOkay, that depends on the scope of the project.\nObviously, if you need to sit down with with a lot of different areas and different stakeholders, it's going to be longer.\nIt's going to take more time and obviously it's going to be and so who most more expensive if you are doing that the version where you're engaging stakeholders in conversations about their problems and needs, who's typically involved and how many people are involved?\nIt it really depends because we've had um projects which are just for an a specific uh part of a company.\nFor example, I don't know, I've worked recently with a with the risk uh team of a of a big national bank.\nSo in that case we were focusing on just what the the risk analyst um workflow was and trying to get use case out of this workflow for them to make the make their lives easier and and make them more efficient.\nBut we've also done as at a highest level.\nSo it obviously depends what the scope of the project is cuz if you want to make use cases that later on are going to be able for the whole company then you're not going to go area by area with all the small tiny areas cuz that will take forever but you then will will go for like with the with the main five areas of the of the company for example would be I don't know operations um risk it will be uh well it depends of the type of of client but you know how deep we dive depends on the scope of the project but it's it's mainly the same objective which is try to bring up their necessities and being able to transform those necessities to the long list of use cases.\nYeah.\nAnd so with that bank you you ran a process to engage them in conversation.\nYou identified a bunch of use cases.\nWe identified more than 250 use cases and out of those 250 use cases which were kind of aligned with the with the with their strategic plan for the next 3 years.\nThey built a strategic road map and we were aligning our AI use cases with their the with their strategic objectives.\nSo we then went on to prioritize creating that matrix we talked about before and we parametric parameterized that matrix with them.\nOkay.\nTo try to align the matrix as much as possible with with what they were looking for.\nThey were looking for cost efficiency.\nSo we try to parameterize the matrix for it to be focused on cost efficiency.\nRight?\nAnd out of that prioritization we brought uh a ranking with that those 250 cases and then we were able to see okay let's start by doing x x number of use cases that are going to be deployed in the next 6 months.\nOkay in our case it was four use cases.\nSo we made a business case for the top 10 use cases to be able what we should expect and which one should we consider to be these four MVPs that we wanted to deploy in the short term.\nAnd by doing this business case we were able to identify what our net value was going to be what our return on investment was going to be and what our payback was going to be.\nSo obviously having in hand what our client had as effort available and money available, we were able to take the four use cases that will make the biggest impact but were under the scope of the project.\nAnd after having that business case, we were able to design what the use case will be.\nSo we had the scope of each use case.\nWe had the the stakeholders impact.\nWe had the data that was impact.\nWe had the different technology stack we needed to use for that use case.\nAnd we build the pipeline and the workflow of that use case to be able bring it down down the use case as we define it uh in the initial step.\nAnd that first that third step I guess is a development of a PC or an MVP.\nHow long does that usually take to go from having down selected to four use cases in this case to having something in market to begin to show the value of that investment?\nYeah.\nOkay.\nWell, um it's really depends cuz we can have small AI use cases that will take maybe uh 300 hours to deploy as as an MVP and start testing it and then maybe 500 hours to scale the solution and be able to have it in production.\nBut we can also have uh thousand a thousand uh hours use case just for building the MVP and then 2,000 for scaling the solution.\nIt's true.\nScaling the solution.\nIt's a really big thing right now and it's really think that it's really impacting businesses because of the high cost of of tokens and the high cost of GPUs running.\nSo, it's really sensitive to really be able to know what the scope of the project is going to be and how many people, how many employees or clients depends on the use case, are we really going to be impacting and are we are going to be using the the solution?\ncuz it's not the same to have a use case that just the risk\n\n\nThe area of our client is using, which is maybe, I don't know, 200, uh, analysts than a virtual assistant that is helping its client every time they have any problem with the app, because maybe we're going to have millions of users interacting with the use case.\nSo that means bigger infrastructure cost and token costs with interaction with the LLM.\nYeah.\nIs there any benefit to having a portfolio of some faster projects and some longer-term projects in that those faster projects will begin to show a bit of a return earlier on that maybe enables momentum with the strategy?\nDoes it matter?\nYeah, definitely.\nWhat we've seen so long is that our clients, I mean, well, in general, everyone is really skeptical with AI, because it's a really expensive world and expensive ecosystem.\nSo people aren't just diving into the biggest ROI use case.\nThey first want to try out in a small sandbox, in a small pilot, and an easy use case to see if it really brings value, rather than starting with the biggest game changers, because usually the biggest game changers are also the one with the biggest upfront cost to deploy the use case.\nAnd some companies aren't willing to start with those use cases, because they find it really, because people don't know much about Gen AI and AI.\nSo that makes everyone really skeptical.\nYeah.\nWith regards to the token cost, does that inform the choice of models and also building in some flexibility with respect to the model that's used to take advantage of new models that are more efficiently results?\nYes.\nYes.\nIt's a big impact.\nThat's the thing we usually focus on.\nIt's the main focus on our business case.\nSo when we make a business case for the use cases, what we take a look at is those type of costs.\nOkay, we take a look at the capex and the opex, and mainly the opex.\nWe want to see what type of use case are we building.\nIs it a virtual assistant where our user is going to be interacting with the client?\nBecause in that case, there's a lot of monetization of the input token and output token, and that input token and output token really variates from GPT40 with DIP, which is open source, for example.\nSo it's a really important thing if when we scale the solution, we can also try to look for strategies in our AI app, which will consider or evaluate the question, and depending upon the complexity of the question, we will call it one LLM or other LLM in order to save money.\nOkay, if you're, if our AI app is being asked what's 2 plus 2, we don't need to call GPT40, because any small model can do that sum for you.\nSo, we're going to be able to, we can offer a strategy to, um, okay, let's have this money just for complex situations or for complex answers.\nAnd that's a thing that really needs to be a focus, and we really take care of it.\nIt also depends if, for example, it's another type of use case, which holds a lot of documents and needs to take a look at a lot of documents, maybe because it's an R A, because in that case, we need to take a look, okay, how long are the documents?\nIt's not the same for a model that needs to extract, uh, it needs to text from data from, for example, you know, PDFs, if it's a 10-page PDF or if it's a 100-page PDF.\nSo we also take a look at what the monetization of extracting the data is, which is different from the tokens with a built virtual assistant.\nOkay.\nSo those are all things that we consider in order to make a business case that makes sense and that really bring you up front what your costs are going to be, so that it's not that you start scaling the solution, then find out the costs are going to the sky, and you're not able to handle the solution and then not able to bring an impact because you're running out of money.\nYeah.\nAnd with that Spanish bank, where did you end up?\nYou had four use cases that you prioritized.\nYou launched four MVPs.\nWhat ultimately did the bank get out of this engagement?\nWell, we, in parallel to these use cases, we defined an architecture, and we also defined a model with the controls needed according to regulation.\nIn our case, in Europe, is the AI Act, AU AI Act.\nAnd well, those three lines, apart from the change management plan we talked about and the operative model we redefine, but the main tangible things were these four use cases, which now we're scaling, and the AI architecture, which we are implementing too.\nSo right now, we're working parallel in these two work streams.\nFirst one, we're scaling the four use cases, apart from we're going to start developing another three use cases as MVPs, but we're scaling those four, and then we're building an agnostic AI architecture to be able to accelerate the new use cases, be able to host our scalable use cases in the AI architecture and accelerate all the new development of use cases, so that it's easier for them to, as we've talked before, to bring impact out of a use case as fast as possible.\nYeah.\nAnd what does that AI architecture look like?\nMaybe not specifically, given this is a client, but in general, what are the components of a...\nWell, that's actually, it's actually a big thing that right now maybe not all clients are considering, because a lot of clients are building the architecture just for the use case.\nSo if you have a use case where you need some monetization or some evaluation or maybe some pro gesture, you'll just build it for the use case, but you're not, you're not really building agnostic architectures, which are really going to accelerate new use cases.\nOkay.\nSo architecture, and I think what architecture should look like is, um, uh, built in microservices, and it's really important, or I see it's really important to be agnostic to any technology.\nRight now, AI is a really newly ecosystem, and it's changing every time to time.\nYou don't want to be locked in with a vendor and then finding out that after a year, it's not the best solution anymore, and you've built your whole architecture based on an specific solution, and it's harder for you to go back and deploy another different solution.\nSo I think it's really important to have an agnostic AI solution, AI architecture solution, which has the different components, different microservices, the orchestrator, the evaluator, the wad rails, and then on those different microservices, they are probably in different instances or in a docker file where they can be treated separately, and they could be developed and scaled separately.\nThen you can see what the best option is right now in the market.\nBut knowing that you're building it as different microservices for you to be able to scale it, change it, and make any adjustment to each different component as a separate part as one.\nSo you're not going to impact the whole ecosystem, the whole architecture, and it's going to be easier for you to adapt to the new trends.\nYeah.\nAnd are you in Deote advising clients on the build versus buy or rent decision when it comes to a solution?\nBecause I would imagine that taps into that perspective that you want to maintain flexibility.\nAnd so I'm curious how you think about that kind of build versus buy, where buy is going to be cheaper, but your flexibility maybe is limited with respect to where it goes and what do your data.\nYeah, it's definitely, we, we, something we advise when we take a look, I mean, we, we know all those financial asset aspects of Gen AI, we take a look at all of them.\nSo obviously, we know the impact that a build versus buy has in money, but it's true, it depends.\nIt's really hard right now for a company to build their own, because we see how big those LLMs are and how hard it is, and how every single month a new update from a different competitor comes on, and it's better than the last one.\nSo, I think it's, it's a difficult conversation, but it's something we can help our client if they're willing to make a decision between buying or building, we will definitely guide them and advise them on the pros and cons of these solutions.\nYeah.\nAs we come to a close, I'd love to ask you some questions about things that you've learned and working across multiple industries and helping them effectively navigate, you know, what is a changing world.\nMaybe we could start with mistakes.\nWhat are the top one or two mistakes companies make when trying to scale AI?\nMaybe one is not having an agnostic AI architecture, but yeah, what are the biggest mistakes?\nOkay.\nYeah, we could, we could talk about like technical errors, as you've said, not being agnostic and not having the focus, but I will say something we've mentioned about before about how these big use cases or the ones with the biggest upfront cost weren't the one that people were building.\nClients are really skeptical about AI.\nThey're not having a midterm, long-term vision on where they need to put the money on.\nSo they, they rather have a small use case that we just make them invest a small amount of money, rather than having this holistic vision on how it's going to impact the whole company and how this investment is going to be a big, big return on investment and a payback of maybe three years, but what will, what will mean in the midterm and in the long term.\nSo I think the fact that people don't really know, or don't really know, as we talked at the start, they don't really know how to separate reality versus a dream of what AI is.\nSo that makes it difficult for companies to know what to invest the money and how, and really take like big investments on AI, because they are skeptical.\nThey, people, when people don't know about something, they are septic.\nThey don't want to put their money on it, because they don't know how it's going to turn out.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, you're saying like the longer-term benefit is going to result from having a kind of cohesive medium-term, long-term strategy versus just rushing into smaller pilots that are easy to get off the ground, but maybe don't like aggregate into something really meaningful.\nExactly.\nSo if you, for example, you build a small pilot or small use case that just helps a specific type of analyst in your risk area of your company, I mean, that will definitely help the analyst that is using it, but what percentage of your company's been impacted by that use case?\n0.1% maybe?\nI mean, that's not going to be a game changer.\nThat's not going to be a, that differentiation strategy from a competitor.\nOkay.\nSo if you want to go with a different differentiation strategy, you got to really invest and know what to invest.\nThat's where Deoid and strategy consulting AI, because it's not about building, everyone can build a model, okay, or an AI app.\nIt's easy, but it's knowing where to locate your money for you to make a different differentiation strategy from your competitors and being able to, in the midterm or long-term, gain market size because of that differentiation strategy, have a different offer than your competitors.\nYeah.\nAwesome, Juan.\nThat's a great place to end.\nI really appreciate you coming by, just curious and sharing your perspectives and learnings with us.\nThank you so much, Stuart.\nIt's really nice to have you here and being part of Just Curious.\nI think we can make really high impact projects.\n",
