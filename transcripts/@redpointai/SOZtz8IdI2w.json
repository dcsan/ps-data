  "cleanText": "Humans have this very strong bias towards thinking that they're right in this vibes-based assessment. Hiring is like the original vibe. Everything definitely does not suffer from that.\n\nAugust of 2023, one of our customers introed us to the co-founders of xAI, and then two days later, they had us into the Tesla office. We were still in college, right? Like, this is insane.\n\nWhat's the state of AI evaluating talent? What will humans be doing in the economy in five years? Please tell us, which is a huge question for everyone. At least everything I'm seeing is leading me to believe that Brendan Foody is the co-founder and CEO of Mercor, a company building the infrastructure for AI-native labor markets. Mercor's platform is already being used to label data, screen talent, predict performance, and evaluate both human and AI candidates. It's a really interesting company at the intersection of recruiting, eval, and core to improving foundation models.\n\nBrendan's team recently raised $100 million, and they're working with some of the most sophisticated companies in AI today. Our conversation today hit a lot of interesting things, including what role humans will play in labor in the future. We talked about the types of data labeling that really matter to improve models going forward. Brendan reflected on Mercor's rapid ascent and some of the key decisions he made. And we also hit on where AI does and doesn't work in the hiring process today. All in all, a really interesting conversation. I think you'll really enjoy it. Now, here's Brendan Foody.\n\nWell, thanks so much for coming on the podcast. Really appreciate it.\n\nYeah, thank you so much for having me on. I'm a big fan. So excited to chat.\n\nYeah. Excited to have you here. I figured we'd start at like the highest level place, which is for our listeners. I'd love if you just contextualize, like, where are we today? What's the state of AI evaluating talent? Like, what works, what doesn't? Uh, what's going on?\n\nI'm amazed at how good it is. Like, I think that everything that a human is able to evaluate over text, the models are close to superhuman at, whether it be the transcripts of someone's interview, the assessments that they're filling out in a written way, or even the signals on their resume. And it's a fascinating dichotomy because so little of that has actually been distributed in the economy, right? And so there's just this like huge green field associated with doing that, and it's one of the things we're really excited about working on and building out.\n\nYeah. Were there things that didn't work pre-reasoning models that, like, you know, maybe talk about the last six months, like, as these models have gotten better, what's like finally started to work for you guys?\n\nYeah, I remember back in end of March of 2023 when GPT4 came out, and we were like, build our first prototype of AI interviewer, and nothing worked, right? It was like the model would hallucinate every two or three questions and all of that. And so it's just been riding this incredible tailwind over time. And I think the reasoning models are just obviously the knowledge in the models improved a lot in sort of the first year, and then the reasoning models have made them much better at particularly handling a lot of context, figuring out what matters, what to focus on, etc. It's been really cool. Still, there's multimodal things that the models aren't as good at, just cuz it historically hasn't been as much of a focus of the labs, and it's a lot harder to do RL with. Um, but we're excited about that being added soon.\n\nYeah. What are the milestones that, like, Matt, you're like, I can't wait till the model can do X or Y or...\n\nYeah. There there's a handful of things, like, there are certain things that the humans are very good at, like this like vibe check of whether I would enjoy working with this person, whether this person is passionate, and like they seem really genuine about what they're saying. Uh, that the model, it's really hard, right? It's hard for the best humans, let alone models. Uh, and so I'm really excited about that, uh, and building evals out for a good chunk of it. But whenever I read through like the reasoning chains of the models, uh, I'm like in trying to decipher things that are eval, I'm always thinking like, wow, the model seems a lot more reasonable than like our than whatever uh researcher on our team was creating the eval, right? And so it's u- it's really incredible how fast they've improved. Um, and I think everyone obviously is seeing everything working in code, but uh, but we're just in the early innings of a lot of other domains, uh, that are taking off in an incredible way.\n\nAnd obviously, it seems like a big part of what you're doing is basically, you know, coming up with evals for humans and how good they'll be at jobs. You know, obviously we have all these people creating like AI employees now. It's like, hey, agents are going to do this, or you'll have an AI agent doing, you know, this set of tasks that an employee would do. Do you guys play into this at all?\n\nAbsolutely. So, I mean, we do a huge chunk of this. Maybe giving a little bit of the backstory of the company. The reason we started is that we felt like there were incredibly talented people all around the world that weren't getting opportunities. And the primary reason is that labor markets are very fragmented and that a candidate somewhere else in the world, maybe it's remotely in the US or another country, was only applying to a handful of jobs. The company in San Francisco is considering a fraction of a percent of people because there's this like matching problem that they're solving manually. And through applying LMS, we could solve this matching problem so that we could build this global unified labor market that every candidate applies to and every company hires from. But then we realized that there was this huge takeoff in hiring people associated with these like new knowledge work roles in evaluating LLMs. Um, and so now we hire, you know, all sorts of the experts for the top AI labs that um use our technology to help facilitate that, um, both for uh, you know, creating evals to to evaluate our experts as well as to evaluate the models and all of these agents that you're discussing.\n\nMaybe for our listeners too, on the Mercor side, um, you guys obviously have a bunch of uses of AI and screening candidates going through resumes. Um, can you talk through some of the different use cases that you have for AI and then what the stack looks like, um, that you guys are building on today?\n\nYeah, I think a good heuristic is just thinking about all the things that humans would do manually, creating evals over those and seeing how we can automate them. So similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and then rank people or decide who should be hired, we automate all of those processes with LMS. And so we have evals for how accurately are we parsing the resume, how accurately are we, you know, scoring different parts of the resume, how accurately are we asking questions in an interview, evaluating that interview, and then passing that all into model context along with the references or every other kind of data that we have on a candidate to make the unprediction around how well they'll perform.\n\nIs it mostly off-the-shelf models and you're kind of curating the evaluation and context around them?\n\nYeah, there's a lot of off-the-shelf models for more basic things, but particularly for the like hardest problem of making the end evaluation of a candidate is where the post training comes in and learning from all the data we get from our customers of who's doing well, for what reasons, how can we learn from those signals to make better predictions around who we should be hiring in the future.\n\nHave you learned anything about anything surprising about those signals of something that the AI found where you thought, you know, maybe this isn't how I would have thought about it or how humans would have thought about it?\n\nYeah, there's there's all sorts of things. I think that one of the key benefits of AI is that it's able to just go way more in depth about like everything about a candidate and it's able to pick up on all the small details that humans sometimes miss or like uh, you know, the the vibe check sort of skips over because people already have their mind made up on a candidate. And so there's all sorts of like little resume signals if um people have demonstrated extreme interest in a particular area where they're just doing it for fun, uh, as you would anticipate, all the way to like different signals of whether someone studied abroad in a country that uh is where they're doing the end job. They might they might communicate better and and be more conducive in a work environment. Um, and and so there's there's lots of those little things that come up and are are very specific to projects and customers.\n\nAre there certain things that you see kind of will always be done by people? You were talking about the multimodal stuff, but I guess how do you see AI and you know, human interviewers working together versus a world where it just kind of goes all AI assessment?\n\nLike at a simplistic level, the hiring process involves assessing candidates and selling candidates. And the assessment part I think is going to soon get so good from LMS that it'll sort of be uh like foolish to think we know better, right? Like will people just like take the recommendation because it'll like have proof that it is performing so much better on the eval on the end outcome that customers care about, where humans I think will still continue to play a really large role in the selling process of like this person that we're going to be working with and spending time with. Um, and I think about it as enabling human recruiters and hiring managers to spend all of their time on the candidates they want to hire rather than all these interviews of people that they don't end up wanting to hire. And so really, yeah, unlocking them to, you know, help people better understand the role, better understand the people that they're going to be working with and all the things that they should be excited about.\n\nYeah, I love that. Will, uh, will people start gaming the assessment? Like, is that something that you've seen at all? I guess the LMS are picking up on certain things if you put in this side of they studied abroad in the right place. They all studied abroad in the, you know, in the place where they're recruiting for that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's why sometimes you have to be a little bit secretive about the signals, right? But yeah, I mean we we have so many things where we we deal this with this as every large hiring process does. And so I think the key is ensuring that assessments are relatively dynamic. Either like the problem that they're working on is changed frequently or that you're asking them super in-depth questions about a particular part of their background because there's so much in the way of talent assessment that becomes possible when the models are able to do immense preparation for an interview, right? Like when I'm like doing a first interview of an executive candidate, like maybe sometimes I'll have references on them, but most of the time I look at their LinkedIn profile for a couple of minutes. I have like some preliminary notes, but imagine if I could go like listen to a podcast that they were on, right? Go read through like blog posts that they've written, all of the papers that they might have done during their PhD and ask about those things, right? You can get way more in-depth and nuanced in a way that's very hard to game.\n\nObviously, you have these models that are pretty good at predicting how well these candidates will do. 27 doesn't matter that that's explainable or like these models just have like, you know, in a black box like yeah, this person's going to be good and this person's not.\n\nYeah, I think it does matter that it's explainable uh for sort of two reasons. First is uh for customers to like understand and trust those those claims, right? Like building trust and uh all all the reasoning chains. And then the second is obviously making sure that the models are selecting people for the right reasons, the reasons that they they should be considering. And so it it's beneficial, but I I think like the end state of the economy is probably just that like it'll be, you know, some sort of API or interaction where people want work done or they they need some level of human involvement uh and just a a confidence interval on how that well that person will perform on the job and there's far less of the uh intermediation that humans play in the process.\n\nYeah, it's like an interim trust milestone on the way on the way there. No, it makes uh makes a ton of sense. And then obviously, you know, today in in kind of the first uh or or one of the areas we have a lot of fit on the data labeling side, there's kind of these clean feedback loops of like, you know, I imagine you could even score like how accurately and you probably have multiple people looking at the same pieces of data. Talk about some of the challenges maybe in translating this to like maybe more vague domains of uh of human work.\n\nTotally. I I mean like venture capital. Yeah. What wait 15 years and uh and then you get your feedback loop.\n\nYeah. One way I think about it is like if you have a hundred people that are all doing the same job, it's very easy to stack rank them versus if you have a hundred people doing a very different job, uh, right? Like founders, right? Like they're all working on something that's nuanced in one way or another. It's very difficult to like pattern match like what is the thing that they said or the thing that we learned that actually translated to the outcome because there's just like so many confounding variables in in the equation. And so I think that it's going to be like relatively easy for the like larger pipelines of roles, like if you're hiring 20 account executives, right? Stackranking all of them, learning from those signals. Um, and then the models are starting to be able to learn from uh these, you know, much more complicated things where everyone's working on something else. uh like we're doing a ranking of a bunch of the the Teal fellows and and that's that's like a fun case, but it it definitely is more challenging uh and relies more underlying reasoning capabilities of the models.\n\nMaybe just talk through like what are some of the challenges that emerge in doing that?\n\nYeah. Well, it it's basically that oftentimes there's a lot of things that aren't in model context and so models struggle to learn from that and people like forget to add it to model context. So maybe it's like I heard my like friend said this good thing about using this company's product, right? And like or these things um that you know might not be making their way in. Making sure that all like references are added, um all the like interpersonal stuff that humans might pick up on. Um so we we found that actually often times just making sure the requisite data is in model context is like uh majority of the problem.\n\nYeah. I guess in\n\n\nThe future, maybe we're just recording every conversation with, you know, our smart glasses and easy enough to feed into the model. Bridgewater had it right all along. Exactly. Exactly. Is that where we're headed? Is it just like it'll be, uh, you know, Bridgewater at scale? Uh, we'll see. Um, I mean, I think, of course, a lot of companies will be adverse to that, and I think there will be regulatory reasons and illegal reasons people don't want to do that. Um, but I, I also think there's just going to be better processes for how models help get this information in context, right? Maybe it's AI doing an exit interview of the manager and the people on the teams to help better understand what was going on because all the people have so many details in their head, uh, around this that we, we just need to get into the models for them to be able to make these superhuman predictions. Yeah, there are certainly more and more both founders and, you know, all kinds of people that are bringing AI to their meetings, and so I think a lot of, you know, those meetings and interactions will be recorded for AI to learn from. Totally. I think that'll be interesting. We need you to take our transcripts and stack rank us against each other.\n\nOnly if I come up on that. Uh, what do you think of the Data Labeling landscape today? Like, how do you see the different players kind of differentiating from each other? It seemed like Scale was really in a position to run away, but then now there's been a bunch of kind of new players in the landscape. Like, how do you, how do you think about that world?\n\nYeah, I, I think like the key thing that most people don't understand in the like data annotation evaluation landscape is just the shift in the market and how dramatically different it is from what it used to be 2 years ago. Cuz when ChatGPT came out, it was the models, like, weren't that good. It was easy to trip them up. They were making mistakes left and right. Like, even like a, a high school student, uh, or, or like college undergrad could do a lot of completions or evals to help improve the models in this crowd sourcing fashion where they run these huge pipelines to get hundreds of thousands of pieces of SFT or RLHF. SFT being inputs outputs, RHF being choosing between a bunch of different like preference options like you would see in ChatGPT. But as the models got really good, that crowd sourcing model started to break because you needed really high-quality people that would work directly with researchers to help them understand why is this model doing well, why is it not doing well, how can we, you know, create this really complicated data that helps to trip up the model and actually reflects like the real world things that we want to automate. And so our platform of finding exceptional people that you would want to work with was perfectly positioned for that, and that we can hire these really high-quality people super quickly. Um, and that caused us to take off and and have all of the the traction working with the big labs. And I think that trend will continue and that like the companies that are stuck in these like super high volume crowdsourcing pipelines, um, are probably, are certainly going to see a lot of churn, and it's going to be the new players that understand the direction the market is headed, um, and lean into really high-quality talent underpinning it that are going to continue taking a lot of market share. Do you think there'll always be demand for, I guess, humans in the Data Labeling process? There's, you know, obviously more and more that can be done with these models, or big model gets really good at one task and then can train smaller model. Like, how do you see that evolving over time?\n\nYeah, the way I think about it is that, so long as there are things in the economy that humans can do that models can't do, we will need to create evals or environments so that models can learn how to do those things. So I think there's certain domains where that's just going to get solved sooner than others, right? Like within math or even many parts of code, like you don't need that much data. It's super verifiable. The models will solve those problems. But then there's other domains that are like much, much more open-ended. What makes a good founder when we're assessing them, right? Uh, or, or you know, most honestly, like a large chunk of Knowledge Work domains, maybe a majority of them are these like open-ended problems that are really difficult to verify and understand what good looks like. And you just need to get all of that understanding that the models don't have into the models. Um, and that's why I expect like orders of magnitude increase in the human data and evaluations market over time. If I understand correctly, you guys, you know, clearly, I think one of the initial arbitrageages you and and what inspired the company is you have these great coders that are all around the world and like, you know, they're not getting access to some of these jobs, and obviously that ended up being really important for coding data. Um, you know, obviously you've expanded into other areas as well. Like what if, you know, coding again, it's the perfect like RL use case. It's probably also really perfect for evaluation. Like what have you had to change or improve as you've like gone into some of these fuzzier domains, uh, and and recruiting people in those areas?\n\nYeah, I think that there leaning on a lot of the heristics of what a human would do manually is probably a good way to do it. So, for example, if you want to automate being a consultant, how would you assess consultants that can help to do that? Giving them a case study. Uh, maybe that's specific to their background. Maybe it's like, maybe a silly question, but like you guys are all probably great coders, and so I imagine you know how to evaluate coders. Like if you're starting to get a doctor on the platform, like, like how do you even know how to what the heristics are for humans? Well, I think the point you're getting at is really interesting, which is that as you start to get into domains beyond like the machine learning team's capabilities, they need to have these experts. We need to have doctors that are helping us create our like doctor assessments and our evals for what makes a good doctor as as well as, um, you know, a bunch of other domains. And similarly, it's what the researchers need to do with all of their technology, right? Like when we were all going on limbs, it was super easy to, uh, you know, look at like the high school level physics and say like what problem was right or or which one was slightly better. But when it's like PhD level chemistry and the researcher doesn't have a PhD in chemistry, it's really hard to understand what's going on to interpret these evals to figure out how we can improve them. Um, and so I think that that's the other big shift to your question earlier around evaluations is, is that both for assessing our talent as well as the re, the way the researchers, uh, assess models. It's just going to be this much more collaborative process and working with people to help trip up the model and improve capabilities. I, I've heard you talk before about how this kind of like short-term data label contract work is like, it is kind of the perfect initial market for what you've done, and there's a massive amount of demand, and it's kind of this wedge to like eventually doing just kind of like end-to-end labor markets. I'd love to just hear you riff a little bit on like what's the sequencing of the company look like from here, uh, you know, toward that vision.\n\nYeah. Well, I wrote our like secret master plan that goes over this a little bit. But the way I think about it is we have like the reason that marketplaces are generally hard to build is that they're very network effect intensive. And so the thing that makes them defensible also makes them hard to build. And so it's important right now that we're very focused on like drilling this wedge of huge amounts of demand that we have to expand the network effects, grow the marketplace and and focus on that right now. Um, but then we're also starting to see a lot of demand for Hiring high volumes of contractors from our existing customers at big tech companies where they might need, you know, hundreds of data scientists or or Software Engineers or whatever the role is for a particular domain outside of human data. Um, which is really the exact same kind of request. Um, it's just a little bit more of a legacy market where you'd be going up against like the Accentures or Deloitte's of the world historically. Um, and so leaning into that as like the second main focus, uh, and then expanding to all sorts of full-time Hiring. Uh, but but one of the key things is that like the lifetime of the business, we've been doing all of these. Uh, like even the first year of the business had nothing to do with human data. It was just like Hiring contractors for our friends and for ourselves, many of which became full-time employees. Um, and so it's, it's much more continuous and there's a lot of things that unify them and that we know that all companies want more candidates. They want to be able to hire them more quickly, and they want confidence that they'll perform well. And so if we just measure those things and improve them over time, that'll position us for every stage of the business. Yeah. Was there a moment that it was like obvious to you to lean into the human data side? Like it was just like so abundantly clear this is where to?\n\nYeah. I remember it was while I was still in college. So, uh, I mean, the background of the business is I met my co-founders when we were 14 in high school. We were all the speech and debate team together. They were like winning all the tournaments that I, I wasn't as good as them, but I was building companies, and then we started Hiring people internationally at the IATS in India. Like we partnered with it, Krogpor's code club, and we were amazed that there were these smart people as you're mentioning that weren't getting jobs, and we felt like we could hire them to build projects. Our friends wanted to pay us to hire them. We could take a small fee. So we hustled a lot, bootstrapped that to a million dollar revenue run rate. We profited 80k after paying ourselves before dropping out, which I was like very proud of. But the parents still weren't satisfied with that, of course, until we had raised money. Uh, but to your question, in August of 2023, one of our customers introed us to the co-founders of xAI while they were still working out of the Tesla office, and he said these, uh, Mercor has these really smart engineers in India that are phenomenal, like math and coding. Uh, and then like the xAI co-founder the next day, uh, got, or one of them or two of them got on a call with me and and our team and were just like really excited, and then two days later they had us into the Tesla office to meet with the entire xAI co-founding team except for Elon. It was right right before one of their meetings with with Elon. We were still in college, right? Like this is insane. Uh, and we were just like, wow, why, like, why do they want what we've built so badly? And it's because there was this change that was happening so fast in the market that no one else had realized yet, right? Um, and now of course we've like scaled that up and and are talking about it because we have, uh, you know, critical mass of of the market share, but, um, but that was that was the point, and then we, but they weren't ready for human data yet, and so it wasn't until call like 6 months later that we started working with a lot of the frontier labs and and really scaling up the business. You could see the see the title wave coming. Yeah. Yeah. I, I think like one thing I've realized over time in founders looking for product market fit is that people try to force things too much sometimes. It's like you need to just look for the signs of the market where it's like, wow, there's like gold to be found and just like drill after that. Um, and cuz like if it's hard to get like an initial sale, then it's going to be hard to scale up the process. You need to rather like look at like what are the like the really strong pain points where the wealthiest companies will pay whatever it takes, right? And just like sniff those out and then lean into them. I guess if you've expanded beyond coding, like maybe to go back to the doctor example, cuz I'm struck by when you were describing it, one, uh, you know, in some senses, like evaling what a good doctor is is like actually what you're what you're eventually going to bring these people to the model companies, like they're going to figure out, like, you know, is this the reasoning process that a that a good doctor would use. What are you actually doing, uh, when you're working with someone to do eval?\n\nYeah, I think that one of the key things that humans are better, a lot better at right now, is like learning over time from the instructions, from the training, from all the feedback. And so, excuse me, looking for these proxies that people have demonstrated of like they're, you know, asking the right questions, uh, about the problem. They're going about thinking about it in the right way. They have signals in their background that indicate they've been in these high-performing environments where people are obviously, uh, learning significantly over time. Um, and all of those translating to them finding ways to trip up the model and and improve capabilities. Do you guys use your own product today and like how does it get used in your own Hiring process? Absolutely. We use it for every role except our executive roles. So I mean we still have the listing for executive roles, but most of our executives, like I, I would take the first interview rather than sending them straight to the AI interview for the selling reason, not the vetting reason. Um, yeah, I mean it's, it's extremely effective. In fact, we've found that in many cases it's like the most predictive signal. I think one thing people underestimate Hiring processes is that humans have this very strong bias towards thinking that they're right in this vibes based assessment. Uh, and like Hiring is like the original vibe everything, right? You definitely do not do not suffer from that. Yeah. And it's like, it's like let's ground everything in the performance data of who of who's actually doing well on the job. I, I remember actually like we, so we have this role we're Hiring for strategic project leads, and we used to have a human case study before like the strategic project lead on-site, uh, to and the on-site is like working with us for a day to see how they would do on various parts of the job and figure out who to hire, and then we switched over to fully an AI process before the on-site, and the conversion went up on the on-site, uh, and so it's like through using the like AI interviewer, just being a lot more objective about the comparisons, having it standardized throughout, uh, you know, everyone who's applying to the role rather and just like mixed across like three different interviewers. It was allowing us to have a lot better conversion. What about on the eval side? Are you guys using kind of a bunch of people that\n\n\nYou source for your own evals?\nYou do a lot of that internally.\nYeah, we use a lot of people, or we work with a lot of people from our marketplace to create our own evals.\nAnd so it's a similar process what we go through with our customers.\nUm, and of course we still need the researchers involved with those people and understanding what are the reasons that the model's making mistakes, how can we create our error taxonomy, have our post training data reflect that air toxonomy and hill climb on the eval, um, but it's all the same processes and and people.\nObviously you talked a little bit about you know using multimodal capabilities to determine like passion and other things like what other things are you thinking about with like you know incorporating like video and and and uh, you know, other things that are futuristic for the for the platform?\nYeah.\nOne thing that I think about a lot is what role RL will have in the sort of like timeline to improve video capabilities.\nAnd that RL is really good at these search problems and video is just like a huge amount of tokens.\nThat's why like models struggle with it.\nAnd so it's like in many ways this search problem of like how do we look for the signal where that person was really excited about the particular thing or uh if they cheated on the interview or like what other things were we could find in multimodal context.\nAnd so I think a lot about how we can effectively you know create the right data to uh get the model to pay attention to those um as well as a lot of what the frontier labs are doing to um to improve those base capabilities.\nI mean obviously it seems like you know even in the course of a few years the Data Labeling market changed so much as you think like two years from now like where do you think this is all going and like do you think this is actually a part of your business or in in two years is it like only the expert of the experts that are uh that are required?\nI think it's a huge part and and the reason is like I mentioned in the beginning we started the business because of this notion of labor aggregation and that it feels like the way labor is allocated in the economy is wildly inefficient and we could make that much more efficient, but a big part of that is making a bet on like what will humans be doing in the economy in 5 years?\nPlease tell us which is which is a huge question for everyone.\nUm at least everything I'm seeing is leading me to believe that it's far more structurally efficient for humans to create evals over the things they don't yet know how to do or sorry models aren't able to yet do than it is for them to like redundantly do that task all the time.\nAnd so I actually think it's highly probable that a huge chunk of Knowledge Work just trends towards creating evals.\nAnd it might not be the like rigid context that we have right now of like people working on an annotation tooling.\nUh it might be much more dynamic and then talking to an interviewer about how to solve their problem.\nUm, but I I think that that is going to uh be just like a huge part of the economy and it's one thing that I think very like very few people are are aware of yet because so many of them conflate it with what's happening in the SFT and RHF market uh where a lot of those data types just aren't as useful as they as they previously were and and budgets for them are coming down.\nWhat do you think will be the most interesting skills for people to develop or kind of I don't know if you were to advise someone um that was in school, you know, what to study or focus on, where would you where would you steer them?\nI would definitely optimize for like a a fast rate of learning because things are changing so quickly, right?\nIt's hard to know like there's so many of these things that people didn't think the models would be good at for a long long time that they just got really good at really fast.\nUm I would say like work with AI as much as possible.\nOne thing I hear from people in our marketplace is that they love the fact that they just get to play around with these models all day.\nLike they get to think about like, you know, they get to spend hours thinking about a problem that the model's not going to work at, not going to be able to do and like what are the things the model is like missing out on.\nAnd they say that they build a lot of valuable skills that help them to know in their workflow as a McKenzie analyst where should they be using AI, where should they not be using AI, etc.\nAnd so I think just spending as much time with the models as possible um and getting very familiar with the things that they're good at or bad at in a particular domain is is really helpful.\nBut it's hard to say like be a Software Engineer be a Software Engineer.\nUm yeah.\nYeah.\nIt's interesting that like uh you know obviously yeah like your point that so many many more of us will be spending time like training these models and like you know there's almost an an infinite amount of things.\nObviously there's like hard skills that have like right or wrong answers but then there's so many like just subjective things and like maybe in the future I don't know we get paid to just train our own individual models for us like totally totally.\nYeah, I I think that'll be a big part of it.\nUm I I would say one other thing is that people should focus on domains where demand is very elastic and so an example is I think there's demand to build 100 or thousand times more software in the economy right and maybe it's not like a thousand times as many web apps but it's like more feature iteration on existing products better ranking algorithms whatever it is versus other roles where demand is probably more fixed like we only need so many accountants, right?\nAnd like so so much of an accounting function.\nAnd so as much as we can focus on those things that there will be vastly more demand for when we're also a safe bet.\nYeah, that's a great way to put it.\nI had a a founder I was talking to the other day and he was like for all this talk about software engineering going away.\nI really could use a lot more Software Engineers.\nI know it's something I'm I'm really excited about.\nLike if they made our Software Engineers 10 times more productive, we'd probably hire more Software Engineers, right?\nSo I think that there's always like interesting uh curves around demand and how pricing will will implicate it over time.\nI mean obviously I imagine when you started like you know there's probably temptation like you could have built like a recruiter co-pilot or like partner like built software for staffing agencies like you've obviously gone decided to go end to end like was that obvious from the start like uh how did that kind of come about?\nI I think part of the start was just shaped by I I think we had a lot of benefit of just approaching the problem from first principles because we hadn't seen how it was done.\nLike we knew the problem our friends wanted solved is they wanted to work with a Software Engineer and so we would just like handle everything associated with getting the Software Engineer that will perform well to be working with them.\nBut in hindsight, I think that there's just many more businesses that will trend towards that because it doesn't make sense to build a co-pilot for a job that probably won't exist, at least in nearly the same way that it does.\nUh it probably makes more sense to have this end-to-end process automated in a way that it's able to learn from the feedback loops and make better predictions.\nYeah.\nThough obviously in your case, I think you benefited from like this Data Labeling market is actually perfect for in at a time of relatively nent capabilities.\nYou can do it kind of end to end, right?\nAnd I'm sure if that didn't exist, I imagine you might have had to go co-pilot for some of these other like complex roles.\nI I think this is absolutely right.\nRight.\nBecause it's like if you're Hiring full-time employees, then obviously definitionally people want to have them on on their payroll.\nAnd so I I think that is one thing that we were fortunate about is that our operating model and the way that we'd structured a lot of the business was very conducive to uh what the demand and the shift we were seeing in the market was.\nInitially, it sounds like yeah, you were you were helping find you know, contractors for for your friends.\nLike did you think like I assume at some point you were like this is a side project and then at some point it became like the main thing like when did you kind of I mean at one point was it like yeah I'm actually going to build this business for the next 20 years versus like this is a cool thing I'm doing at the start of college?\nWell well the background is that I was always building companies in high school.\nI had a company that was doing pretty well so I didn't want to go to college and I told my parents like no I'm I'm not going to go to college and they did not like to hear that.\nAnd so then eventually I appeased them.\nI applied to college, uh, went to school, but I told them like, I'm always I'm going to drop out.\nAnd they didn't really believe me.\nThey figured that it was a safe bet once I'd agreed to go to school.\nAnd then I I went to school and every block the term teal fellow on like, please don't look up.\nYeah.\nEvery semester, you know, I tell them the same thing.\nAnd then eventually I dropped out without really giving them a heads up or telling them because I was like, I've been telling them for the last two years, right?\nYou gave me a heads up.\nI gave them a heads up.\nWrong heads up.\nRight.\nUh, and so I think for me it was that like I knew that I I just wanted to build a company.\nI was like passionate about building things that have impact in the world rather than sitting through classes that didn't feel very productive.\nUm, and I was in many ways just finding the the right thing to to spend my time on.\nI think with my co-founders it was starting as a side project, you know, wanting to wanting to make sure they had the evidence to justify their parents their decision to drop out.\nUm, and it's funny their uh parent or sort part of their condition for dropping out was that we would raise money and even though we had this business that was doing a million dollar revenue run, right?\nWe'd profit at 80K after paying ourselves, right?\nIt was like making a lot of progress.\nThat that wasn't sufficient.\nThe key was that we needed to raise our seed round.\nThat's what keeps us VCs in business.\nParents wanting to validate.\nIt's the credibility stamp.\nWell, that's a good segue.\nYou recently raised a lot of money at $100 million round.\nCongrats.\nThank you.\nUm, what does that kind of allow you to do now?\nOr how did you think about, you know, when was the right time to go raise more capital?\nI'm sure people want to throw money at you all the time.\nSo, like, how do you think about cutting off when to cut off the spigot?\nWell, it's it's also interesting.\nThe only time we went to raise money was really our seed round where we were like, \"Okay, we need to raise money uh to justify dropping out.\"\nAnd then our series A and our series B.\nExactly.\nOur series A and our series B were both preemptive.\nAnd so our thought process was that we wanted to keep dilution relatively low at 5%.\nUm and sort of build up like a war chest so that we could invest in the product capabilities that we were talking about of like how do we you know have referral incentives and all sorts of these creative uh consumer products that can build up the supply side of our marketplace as well as investing in more post- training data to improve our models performance prediction capabilities.\nUm and in many ways one of the largest blockers on our like ML team is just creating more evals and more uh and more RL environments to per improve our models which happens to be very conducive to our business.\nYou you have a kind of customer base of a lot of foundation model companies like what do you think happens to that landscape over time?\nI mean some people are like you know uh it will consolidate to to two or three maybe we'll see more.\nYou know how many different players do you think we end up with and and how do they ultimately differentiate?\nIt's a very good question.\nI definitely am in the school of thought that OpenAI is and will continue to be a product company, not an API company.\nI think that so many of the API capabilities will get commoditized and it's really how you integrate with all the customers context and that over time where they're able to generate a lot of pricing power, but I think that the market is going to be so large that I could see each of them leading into a given segment that they're able to absorb a lot of value.\nLike even if one of these labs were just go all in on building a hedge fund, I bet they could make a ridiculous amount of money, right?\nAnd so I yeah, I think it's easy to like pattern match and say these companies are overvalued, but if you really approach the problem of like automating Knowledge Work and like what that opportunity is from first principles, it's like it's hard to justify that these companies with such exceptional teams making so much progress won't be able to build really incredible businesses.\nYeah.\nYeah, I mean obviously today it feels like there's been so much just like cross domain generalization that that like it feels like it's trended toward like a more of a winner take all or the top take most versus like hey we'll have one that's really good in this place and one that's good in that though I guess your hedge fun examples is interesting in so far as like you could obviously there's a lot more to build around the scaffolding of the model to to make that work.\nYeah, I mean there are a lot of value there's a lot of value to focus.\nI think that having a general API is probably not a great business for multiple companies.\nUh and so I think that there's there's going to be one player in that uh likely, you know, one of the one of the top two labs right now.\nAnd then there's uh going to be just a huge amount of customization that happens at the application layer for every vertical and every customer use case.\nYeah.\nAnd you think like for a lot of those like custom models that uh that require some some sophisticated uh labeling?\nOh, certainly.\nI mean, there is like so much.\nI mean, imagine if every trading firm could have evals over like the particular parts of their like trading analysis that were accurate conclusions versus inaccurate conclusions that translated to trade doing well or not.\nAnd like you had one of the top post training teams that was just focused on like how do we optimize having the right trading analysis for sort of mid-frequency faster than our human traders are able to get to it.\nI I think there's a huge amount of opportunity.\nUh by talking to you.\nIt feels like some trading firms optimal strategy should just\n\n\nBe stop trading,\nspend nine months just like laser-focused on a post-training model.\nMaybe I actually have been sort of surprised that a lot of the trading firms are less sophisticated in post-training than one would have anticipated.\nI think that part of it is just the geographic separation of all of them being in New York or having a big good chunk of their core teams in New York versus the labs being in San Francisco and a lot of the top researchers wanting to work on AGI rather than making money.\nUm, and so yeah, but I think that they're going to invest vast amounts in it.\nUm, and there there's just going to be these sort of like nine-figure, 10-figure partnerships with Frontier Labs to help customize their specific use case.\nWhat's the biggest unknown question you have in AI right now that you feel like has you're like, \"God, if I knew the answer to this, it would make big implications for how I'm running the business today?\"\nI think it's what you said earlier of what humans will be doing in like five or 10 years.\nLike that's such a hard question to answer, and I think about that as the mission of the company in many ways, and we have all sorts of intuitions, but the world is changing very fast.\nUh, I think like so many jobs are going to get automated that getting a better understanding of that and how we can help define humans' new opportunities and the role that they play in the economy is one of the most important things.\nYeah.\nIs there more stuff that we should be doing from a policy perspective around this, or how do you think about the role other institutions in society should play here?\nAbsolutely.\nLike I think that so many regulators have been very focused on things that actually aren't as close to impacting American lives, and that they're focused on competition with China, which sure it matters, but it's a lot less close to people's day-to-day.\nThey're focused on safety risks, which matter, but are a lot less close to people's day-to-day.\nI think the thing that everyone's going to start freaking out about in the next two or three years is just that there's these models that are significantly better than them at their jobs, and we need to figure out how they're going to fit into the economy.\nAnd that's something we know will happen, right?\nIt's not just this low probability, high-impact risk.\nAnd so I think that regulators need to be much more proactive around how we can plan for that future, around how we can stay like expectation management for the general public and what the world will look like in a few years.\nYeah.\nI guess it's just hard not knowing what we're retraining people for.\nYeah, it is exactly, but I wish that there was a lot more conversation around that, right?\nUm, and a lot more focus on what that next generation of jobs is going to look like and what guidance we should be giving to everyone as they're going through school and entering the workforce.\nYeah.\nWell, we always like to end our interviews with a quickfire round where we get your, you know, quick take on some overly broad questions that we stuff in at the end.\nUh, and so maybe to start, uh, would love, you know, what's one thing that's overhyped and one thing that's underhyped in the AI world today?\nOh, good question.\nI think that evals are underhyped very significantly.\nEven though they're hyped, I think they're still underhyped very significantly.\nI think one of the last bastions of human capabilities.\nYeah.\nI think the one thing that's really overhyped is like SFT chef data, that bucket of legacy data.\nThere's companies that are literally spending billions of dollars on it that don't need to be spending or need to be spending an order of magnitude less.\nUm, and that'll change.\nWhat's one thing you've changed your mind on in the AI world last year?\nInteresting.\nI think my timelines for automating software engineering have gone up significantly.\nLike I used to, I used to be a little bit skeptical of hearing from researchers what their timelines are to having a really good AI software engineer that's able to write a PR that has a higher hit rate than a human.\nAnd I think now it seems clear that that's coming later this year, sometimes in the first half of next year.\nUm, and that's going to be really, really cool.\nYeah.\nDo you think, I mean, obviously, like it seems like with some of these AI improvements, you know, it's like if you talked about them what they were two years ago, you would have said, \"Oh my god, it's going to change the world.\"\nAnd then they happened, and it's like, okay, like that kind of adjusted things, but not like do you feel like that's this like, oh wow moment where like, you know, there's just mass change in employment on the software engineering side, or is it one of those things that will feel like some 10% change or 20% change?\nWell, I think the thing that frames it is the elasticity that we were talking about of the role, and that I'm less worried about the short time horizon of engineering jobs because I think giving them tools to make them more productive will just mean we build more software.\nBut it will definitely change the nature of the role in that people that are product-minded, people that understand how to do the things that models might not be as good at, have more of a comparative advantage in the market.\nWhat AI startup are you most excited about besides Mercor?\nI'm really excited about OpenAI's coding capabilities, even though that's not a contrarian answer.\nI also think that there's going to be an immense amount of custom agents, and so there's a company I'm friends with that's sort of like in stealth, um, that I'm super excited about.\nAll right.\nWell, you definitely can't share it on this podcast.\nWhen we stop recording, we'll harass you for what that is.\nUm,

something that I think is more positively impactful because I think that I think that you know, making sure that we get to the right like valuation by the morning instead of the afternoon probably
