  "cleanText": "Tom Okino, you are the CPO of Vercel, one of the hottest companies in AI and the makers of V0, which everybody I know is talking about for AI prototyping.\nHow big is V0?\nWhat numbers can you share with us?\nYeah, V0 has been used by about 2 million people since last year, and we're growing really, really fast.\nEven if you're not an engineer, even if you're non-technical, the era of personal software is absolutely upon us, and this has been the most exciting thing for me.\nI really don't think about the competition.\nI think about our customers and delivering as much value as I can, and I also think about my own use case.\nWhat are the other AI things you're using as a CPO in your day-to-day that help you?\nWhy should I watch this episode?\nIn this episode, we're going to talk about V0 as a tool, how to use it to transform not just the way you do your job, and then we'll talk about how the team that builds V0 built it, how they use it themselves, as well as more generally Vercel's strategy for and approach to product development.\nAn AI startup valued at $3.25 billion.\nIn today's episode, we're going to walk through a live demo of their hit product V0, which is one of the leading AI prototyping tools on the market.\nWe're going to talk about how Vercel builds product, how V0 uses V0, and the future of product management in the era of AI prototyping.\nSo, if you're a product manager, designer, or engineer, or even just someone founder using AI prototyping tools, there's a lot to learn.\nSo, let's get started.\nReally quickly, I think a crazy stat is that more than 50% of you listening are not subscribed.\nIf you can subscribe on YouTube, follow on Apple or Spotify podcasts, my commitment to you is that we'll continue to make this content better and better.\nAnd now on to today's episode.\nTom Oino, you are the chief product officer at Vercel, one of the hottest companies in AI and the makers of V0.\nAnd what I wanted to know is how big is V0 now?\nCan you share in terms of users or revenue how much you've grown?\nYeah, nearly 2 million people have used V0 since we launched last year.\nUh, we're growing fast.\nIt's sort of exponential here, and the uptake has been really, really exciting to watch.\nUh, of those people that have used V0, many of them are deploying what they've built.\nUh, we've had over two and a half million deployments to Vercel from V0.\nSo building things that are out there and in use, not just prototypes, which is I think the most common use case I've been talking a lot about, but actual apps, it's pretty amazing.\nSo can we show people how V0 works and how you can build apps?\nYeah, absolutely.\nAnd I'd love to show some of the stuff that I've built for myself that I use on a daily or weekly basis.\nUh, let me share a screen here.\nSo uh, where do you want to start?\nSo I love LinkedIn, of course.\nIt's how I built basically this solopreneur business.\nBut what if I wanted a better version of LinkedIn's newsfeed?\nI see a better.\nI'm curious.\nUh, let's actually enhance the prompt here and see if we can create something that uh, you know, is a lot better.\nSo the first thing I did is I just said, look, my prompt was silly, but maybe you can embellish it a little bit.\nUh, and now we're going to let V0 cook.\nUh, let's see.\nIt's coming up with a plan.\nUh, it's got a project structure.\nI actually love looking at the thinking.\nSo while it's actually like authoring all of the code, I'm like reading in, let me see the plan.\nUh, we need some layout navigation, a feed with different post types.\nOkay, we're going to have post interaction components, user profile card, and detail view.\nSo, the whole plan here, great.\nI didn't have to put any of the plan together, and now it's cooking over here on the side.\nSo, we'll watch it write some code.\nIt's basically created a whole multiple document for us.\nYeah, it basically put together a very lightweight PRD.\nYeah.\nUh, and yeah, now we're we're authoring some code over here.\nLooks like we're building a navbar.\nWe've got our layout, our page.\nThere's going to be a profile component.\nI'm excited to see what it looks like.\nAnd we just let it go without a screenshot.\nIs that how you often prompt?\nYeah, I think um I do a mixture.\nIf there's something that I'm inspired by that I I want it to be, you know, something that looks like this, but with that change or with this tweak, I'll start with a screenshot.\nAnd I think we should look at an example of that.\nActually, maybe we can uh let's do that in parallel here.\nWhile we're cooking on our LinkedIn uh in the first the first one, let's actually use a screenshot.\nSo, you had sent me uh a version of your loggedin homepage.\nYes.\nSo, looking at Apollo.io where I was last VP of product.\nYeah.\nCool.\nSo, um let's see.\nDo we want to make any changes or just create a clone of of what's So, I think what we want to do is uh customize the homepage based on the product that people are using.\nAnd since Apollo like all SAS products has like 10 products that people are using.\nFor instance, me, I'm not using it to send emails.\nI'm using it for meetings and booking meetings.\nSo for me, it should customize and show the upcoming meetings that I have.\nBut if somebody's sending a bunch of emails, it should show, hey, these are the emails you've sent and the performance of those emails.\nLet's try this prompt.\nSo, we'll we'll take our um we'll take our screenshot that we've uploaded here.\nYou can kind of see a little version of it.\nUm and we'll try to take it just emphasize upcoming meetings for this specific user and let's see what we get from a screenshot.\nUm while we let it cook, why don't we go back and see what's going on with LinkedIn over here?\nOkay, we're creating a pretty sophisticated application.\nUm this uh there's going to be a feed, there's going to be suggested connections.\nLike, this is pretty amazing.\nUh, and we did not really give it much direction.\nSo, I'm very excited to use this.\nIt's amazing how much effort it will go off and do.\nLike a human would never go out and do that much effort in one shot.\nYeah, exactly.\nAnd, you know, I think there's a few different ways to do this.\nOne is like you can just get started and build and then iterate really quickly.\nAnd I like the iteration velocity of like just tweak this, just add that.\nBut, you know, if you want something that feels more fullfeatured, that feels like it's, you know, um you could actually start from from something you can actually use and then you want to tweak from there.\nI think you can we can really let it cook here.\nAnd again, that prompt enhancement really turned this into a proper PRD with a lot of features.\nIt also obviously knows a little bit about the LinkedIn product offering.\nSo, it's building out mock data now.\nUm, so we can actually fill in the newsfeed, which is awesome.\nOver here, we already have our version of the Apollo homepage that puts, let's see, scheduling meetings first.\nUh, we've got a view all meetings view.\nLet's see some email stats and meeting activity.\nSo, it pretty much followed it exactly and it took a little bit of the Apollo styling elements.\nSo if we wanted to ask it even further like replicate the Apollo nav, what would it does that poi navation as well?\nAnd then my traditional approach has been to do these feature enhancements like one step at a time.\nIf we had another feature enhancement like I want us to once we click into that be able to look at like whether people have paid us or something for the meeting.\nWould you recommend doing that separately?\nlike I typically do or doing it at once.\nYeah, I'll usually just because I like the changes to be atomic, I'll say like, \"Let's do this and then let's do that.\"\nUm, and then I can roll back individual changes, etc.\nBut it's very good at taking like five different things and breaking it out and saying, \"Okay, here's the five things I need to do and doing them all at once.\"\nSo, it depends on if you want those incremental states or not.\nUm, but yeah, personally I will do one thing at a time and it's it feels more like a a pull request to me.\nOkay, my next poll request is going to be adding the calendar widget.\nThen my poll request is going to be look at the this component.\nGot it.\nSo when you use some of your competition, you're like choosing like a specific model that you might use like in Windsurf, okay, I want to use Claude Sonnet 3.7 or 3.5.\nfor you guys under the hood.\nYou guys are using, I'm guessing, like multiple different models for different use cases.\nYeah, that's right.\nYou know, one of the things we don't want to do is expose all of the underlying sophistication.\nWe really want to pave a happy path.\nUm, so our model, you know, we call it an online model because not only is it um using the underlying LLMs, but it's then doing a bunch of work on top.\nsomething like 85% of the code that the LLM's give back to you won't run by default yet.\nAnd they're getting better and better.\nSo, we then um iterate on the code that comes back and tweak it and fix it up based on everything that we know.\nAnd we do that on top of a bunch of different models.\nGot it.\nOkay, let's see.\nWe've got a new navbar here.\nUm this is great and it looks exactly like our screenshot.\nSo, it's really good at copying design.\nI think that's why it's so useful in this prototyping use case we have here because let's say I was the VP of product and I had asked the PM about this feature.\nThey can come back with a prototype literally five minutes later.\nThat's exactly right.\nAnd this use case is really really powerful because even if you're not an engineer, even if you're non-technical, you can demonstrate the idea that you have in your head with extremely high fidelity and very very little time.\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS.\nIf you're building a SAS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning.\nThat's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.\nTheir APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features.\nToday, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.\nOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine grained authorization service.\nWarrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.\nThis enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.\nIf you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign on, SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS.\nIt's a drop-in replacement for V0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free.\nCheck it out at works.com/acos to learn more.\nThat's works.com/ aos.\nToday's episode is brought to you by Jira product discovery.\nIf you're like most product managers, you're probably in Jira, tracking tickets and managing the backlog.\nBut what about everything that happens before delivery?\nJurro product discovery helps you move your discovery, prioritization, and even road mapping work out of spreadsheets and into a purpose-built tool designed for product teams.\nCapture insights, prioritize what matters, and create road maps you can easily tailor for any audience.\nAnd because it's built to work with Jira, everything stays connected from idea to delivery.\nused by product teams at Canva, Deliveroo, and even The Economist.\nCheck out why and try it for free today at atlassian.com-discovery.\nThat's a t-san.com/roduct-discovery.\nJurro product discovery.\nBuild the right thing.\nUm, I'm very interested in going back to see where we're at with our LinkedIn clone because this thing I feel like is probably a pretty fullfeatured app.\nWe actually have images in here.\nThat's fantastic.\nUm, trending topics.\nWe've got a post composer.\nOkay, this actually seems to work pretty good.\nUh, okay.\nLet's see what else we have.\nI almost Okay, there was one.\nI could I could choose to fix this route with V0.\nIt's like, oh, I haven't implemented that one.\nSo, I can ask it to fix it.\nBut I'm interested in exploring what we do have.\nUh, it implemented uh we have notifications.\nUh, we can we can click through those.\nLet's see.\nThis is like a pretty sophisticated application.\nUm, I'm going to ask V0 to fix that runtime error next.\nAnd we'll just see what that flow looks like.\nSo, that was me going to the profile me route.\nAnd I'm going to say, okay, let's try to fix this one.\nWhile it cooks, it says the code returns the following error.\nPage not found for profile me.\nIt's like, oh, let me look and see what's happening.\nI don't have that route.\nLet me implement it for you.\nSo this iterative iterative um you know I'm exploring the thing that we're building and then kind of building it interactively I think is is a pretty fun way to do it.\nYeah.\nAnd how does V0 work with databases?\nYeah.\nOne of the things I'm very excited we added were these integrations.\nUm so right now we have a number of integrations from the Vercel marketplace that work sort of out of the box with zero need to go off and create accounts and all this other stuff.\nThe integration is really seamless.\nIt's a couple of clicks.\nSo if I wanted to back this with a proper database and then fill the database with mock data, I could connect, you know, Neon.\nI could create a store.\nI could um also connect not just databases but other AI providers.\nSo if I want to add features from, you know, AI features to my generation, I can connect those seamlessly as well.\nSo very excited especially about you know Grok by XAI coming in here and offering like a very generous offering to get started and really explore what AI looks like to add and what these uh marketplace\n\n\nIntegrations look like to add that would be fun to do.\nSo, could we try to add like a Grok powered post composer?\nWhat would that look like?\nLet's try to do it.\nLet's, let's add... We're going to do it live.\nUh, let's add... We'll create a new store.\nUh, I'm going to try on the free tier to start.\nWe'll continue, start with that.\nInstall it.\nOur product was created successfully.\nSo, we're done.\nWe're back in our application.\nUh, and now let's see.\nIt's thinking on maybe our previous uh request as well.\nHere we go.\nI see you've added the Grok integration your product.\nUm, what would you like to build within your newsfeed application?\nLet's add an AI powered post composer uh in the start post flow.\nLet's see where it goes.\nHopefully some LinkedIn PM tries this.\nYeah, I mean, this is, you know, I really do like the... somebody else has designed something that works really well, and I can start with that as my starting point, and you don't have that blank canvas thing.\nI'll never have that again.\nBut yeah, LinkedIn has a model that works pretty well.\nWe can start with that.\nUm, we could also add storage or AI to our other generation over here.\nUm, while that's cooking, I could also walk through some of my own generations.\nI don't know if that's interesting for folks.\nYeah, as a CPO, what do you get time to generate?\nWhat is useful?\nWhat have you been generating in VZO?\nSo, one of the things, yeah, this is like my favorite thing.\nI, I don't really have time to sit down for hours on end code anymore, but I still have ideas, and I still have little personal software that I want to exist.\nOne that I created somewhat recently is I just want to go back and look at all of our blog posts and change logs and just filter them by like, you know, various things, various topics.\nSo, like I wanted to look for all the observability change logs.\nUm, and so great, I like built this thing that consumes an Atom feed.\nIt was like a handful of prompts, and now I use this in order to pull together the like summary from a different product area.\nI can filter by like start dates.\nIt built all of this UI for me.\nAnd here's the two observability related change logs we've had in April.\nUm, so this is a tool.\nI actually use it.\nI, I love it.\nUm, I was on a call with a an e-commerce prospect recently, and they were like, \"How could Vzero help change the way that we build things?\"\nAnd I did this.\nThis was ridiculous to me.\nIt, it oneshotted a sneaker store.\nThis is literally the full prompt, right?\nAnd I did enhance prompt again, but this is only one prompt.\nI haven't touched anything.\"\nAnd the biggest thing that I wanted to demonstrate was real time filtering because I feel like most e-commerce stores have filters that like you have to wait for a page refresh.\nIt's really clunky.\nAnd this does real time filtering based on price, brand, attributes.\nAnd they were like, \"Oh my gosh, I could plug this directly into my back end and just use this with all of the media coming from their back end.\"\nAnd this was... I'm still kind of in shock that this was a one shot.\nAnd what's the workflow that somebody will typically use for that?\nThey'll export this code into Windsor or cursor, their IDE of choice, or how do they typically go from here?\nYeah, you certainly can.\nI mean, we can connect to databases from right in the web browser.\nI love the web browser as a creation uh not just consumption vehicle, but yeah, you can take this codebase and you can export it into any editor, and then you can start to enhance it.\nUm, we're working on making it seamless to flow back and forth between the editor and the creation experience in Vzero.\nSo you can kind of like, you know, every change is a an atomic sort of pull request or a git commit, and then you can actually bring that repository into your editor and bring it back into Vzero.\nUh, it varies.\nEverybody's workflow is a little different, but we're pretty flexible about it.\nVery cool.\nWhat else have you built?\nUh, one of the other things I'm very excited to try, our Grok integration over here.\nBut one of the other things that I'm, I'm just really excited about is like my wife used to ask me for this.\nI just want to know what neighborhood I'm in.\nWe lived in New York City, and we would go out to dinner in certain neighborhoods, and she's like, \"I wish I could just see what neighborhood I'm in.\"\nWe could kind of try to use Google Maps for this.\nThere's like some some services, but I was like, \"I just want one button.\"\nSo, I actually turned this into a thing that I deployed, and I use this every week.\nI use this to figure out what location, whatever.\nIt's just a super simple thing.\nBut my wife loves it because it was, it was software that was designed exactly to her specification, and I just have it pinned to my home screen on my phone, and we use it, you know, whenever we go somewhere, it's like, \"Oh, this is a nice neighborhood.\"\nUm, so this was a fun one I made for me.\nUm, that's a really interesting future after apps like Vzero have hit the market, right?\nWhich is that anybody can make personalized software.\nI love this.\nSo, it sounds like people can go to wear.tomino.com to try it themselves.\nYeah, they can try it themselves.\nAbsolutely.\nGive it a shot.\nUm, I, this is like the the era of personal software is absolutely upon us, and and this has been the most exciting thing for me.\nI used to have this list of all the things I wanted to build and no time to actually build them, and now I can build them again.\nUm, let's, let's see what we did over here on our LinkedIn news feed with the Grok integration.\nUh, user clicks start a post and clicks on the AI assist button.\nOkay.\nWhat would you like to write a post about?\nUh, I actually do like this prompt.\nShare thoughts on recent tech trends in a LinkedIn style.\nI'm keen to see how it does.\nOkay, let's see.\nInvalid API key.\nOkay, this is great.\nLet's see if we can fix it with Vzero.\nAll right, my favorite thing is fixed with Vzero because usually what are you going to do?\nYou're going to go search for how to fix something, and it's like, \"Oh, we can just ask them.\"\nUm, I'll fix the API key issue.\nProblem is we're accessing...\nUh, let's see, a discerning voice can probably find it.\nUm, in project settings, we usually have uh API keys and things that we may need to pull.\nSo I'll copy in in case we need to put it in, and it's off chugging.\nAI module does not provide export name.\nWe'll fix that one as well.\nRuntime error.\nOkay.\ncontent.\nYeah, the other... let's see all my project settings.\nYeah, see no environment variables.\nLet's do that X API key.\nAnd I'm going to just burn this API key right after.\nDon't forget that step.\nRight.\nYeah, there we go.\nOkay, this is trying to load an image that doesn't actually exist.\nUm, I'd love to go back to here.\nHere we go.\nLet's go back to this one and load this block.\nRestore.\nOkay.\nSo, you're going to return back to an earlier version.\nYeah, I'm going to restore the previous version right after we added the integration because now I've also added in the API key.\nOkay.\nUh, I may have gone back one click too far.\nLet's restore after.\nDid it wrong here.\nI feel like that's one of the big tricks here of using this is these restore buttons.\nJust scrolling back up a little bit.\nYeah, I'm looking in my like different versions.\nUm, this was the one that we, we restored.\nSo, we have our AI assist, and let's see if we've added our... Okay, the API key was reverted as well.\nSo, I have to get our API key going.\nUm, but you know, we'll, we'll fix some errors here, and we'll get it working.\nUm, over here, let's see our... I was wondering if we wanted to add any like database or any integrations to this, but yeah, we can also continue the conversation.\nI would be interested to see both database and deploying what those look like.\nYeah, we should deploy one of these.\nSo, um, let's see.\nLet's, let's add one of our database integrations here.\nUm, I'm not sure what we want to store in the database, but we can fill it up with some data.\nI'm going to create a new Neon store.\nUm, maybe just like the meetings that we have coming.\nYeah, let's do uh deploy here.\nWe'll add a database for upcoming meetings, and we'll try to integrate the data from the database.\nSo, Neon gave us a database created successfully.\nIt's thinking about the integration we just added.\nAll right, let's see.\nLet's store upcoming meetings in the database.\nPlease fill with uh mock content for the next month.\nAnd then we'll have to... we'll hopefully replace these upcoming meetings with um something from the database.\nSo we're really like vibe coding here.\nLike I haven't actually looked at any of the code that's been generated.\nWe're just kind of dictating what should be done.\nAs an engineer myself, I like to actually go back and forth.\nUm, I'll go and actually make changes to the code and say, \"No, not like that.\nJust like this.\"\nAnd that's still fun.\nBut if you don't have any coding experience, this is both a good way to still build amazing things and to learn how to code.\nYeah, I think so.\nOr just somebody like myself who hasn't been coding a lot in the last three or four years.\nIt's a good way to like get back into it.\nExactly.\nI mean, this was my thing.\nI've been in management and leadership for a very long time.\nI haven't been sending poll requests.\nI can't support the code that I author, right?\nUm, so this is a good way for me to be able to build again.\nLooks like we've created a a meetings table.\nWe're creating... Yeah.\nThe one worry one of my podcast guests had, he's a VP of product here.\nHe was like, \"We're kind of entering the golden age of the feature factory because we've allowed all the seauite to create these prototypes for us.\"\nIt's true.\nAnd the seauite does have a lot of feature requests.\nYou know, you talk to one customer and you want to make their dreams come true.\nYou're like, \"Yes, absolutely.\nThis is incremental.\nWe'll add that.\"\nAnd now we sort of can.\nSo we have to be discerning.\nYou have to have strong opinions about what belongs in and out.\nWe also can't let the XY problem thing happen.\nLike customers ask for one thing even though they really want something different, maybe more foundational.\nSo we still have those strategic conversations and make sure we're not just yolo shipping net new features all the time.\nUh okay, let's see.\nWe're going to populate the meetings table with some mock data now.\nSorry, I could have been applying that while we were chatting.\nI think that uh that it's actually emphasizing the PM skill set though because now everyone is getting into, hey, what are the things that actually are going to move the business outcomes that we want?\nWhat are just one-off customer requests versus actual problems lots of our customers face and figuring out that prioritization of what to put in.\nThat's right.\nIn a world where you can decrease the cost or time taken to build something, um certainly you could try more things, but you really want to be strategic and thoughtful about what direction you go in because it's very easy to go in the wrong direction now.\nUm, it's very tempting to just like, oh, we'll just try a bunch of things.\nI think that strategic thinking, problem solving, depth of ownership is really, really important.\nI mean, the biggest job that um the most important job that PMs play is the the sort of deep owner of a product.\nAnd you still need that.\nYou can't have other people yoloing new features into your product.\nIt has to be cohesive.\nIt has to feel like, you know, you're you're taken on a journey and that it's solving real problems for you.\nSo, the PM skill set is as relevant as ever, 100%.\nLet's see.\nWe've created our database.\nWe're updating our application to fetch and display these meetings from the database.\nOkay, great.\nAll right, we're missing our environment variable, so we'll have to get that auto configured in the future.\nUh, neon database URL.\nI'm going to go look at my URL.\nNeon database URL.\nUh, I'd like to stop sharing screen so I can... maybe I can move this over uh so I can copy my database URL and we'll paste it in.\nGreat.\nAll right.\nSo, we had to add the environment variable here.\nExactly.\nOkay.\nNow that we've got the environment variable, we're set up.\nGoing to recreate.\nYeah.\nOne of the things we're also working on is making incremental regenerations um much uh faster.\nSo you can only update the part of the the application that you need.\nOkay.\nVery cool.\nWhat is the... what is the overall team you guys have staffed behind Vzero right now?\nTeam is pretty small.\nYou know, we're split into sort of three, three pillars on on Vzero.\nOne is the sort of research and language model and um you know we have this uh dev one uh model that we use, we call an online model.\nSo we're constantly iterating on that.\nWe're also working on all of the fundamentals of the chat experience.\nSo this core experience that we've been using.\nUm, and then the third pillar is around the periphery.\nSo all of the um administration and the you know uh billing and account settings and project settings.\nUm, team is pretty small.\nI would say there's less than 14 people working on Vzero all up across engineering, product, and design.\nWow.\nSuper lean.\nSuper lean.\nYeah, and really tight-knit, too.\nIt's been really fun to watch the team cook.\nThat's awesome.\nHow big is Vercel overall in terms of product design and engineering?\nEngineering, product, and design all up.\nUm, probably right around 200.\nUm, one of the benefits of Vzero and many of the other teams is that they get to build on top of the foundations we've created for Vercel.\nSo, we didn't have to create a net new accounts system and a net new marketplace of integrations.\nThose things have existed, and then kind of bringing them together uh is is much easier than building those things from scratch.\nThe biggest one obviously is our deployment infrastructure.\nSo at some point we're going to deploy one of these.\n\n\nThings we've created.\nI can deploy something else that exists here.\nI'm like, I don't think I ever deployed this sneaker store.\nBut you can see that like when I deploy this thing now, you've got a decade's worth of managed infrastructure just, you know, wearing into action, um, and creating a deployment.\nAnd like, pretty soon, I'll have this open to the entire internet, um, and then I can go further and customize my domain.\nI can add people to the project because this project will be backed by a Vercel project.\nSo all of the, all of the everything you can do with a Vercel project, um, adding team members and customizing, you know, everything about it, uh, backs every one of these deployment.\nAI evals are one of the most important skills for PMs, and I know you know they matter.\nThe question is, are you doing them right?\nMost teams are winging it with basic metrics and hoping for the best.\nMeanwhile, the teams that actually ship reliable AI, they've cracked the code on systematic evaluation.\nToday's episode is brought to you by the AI evals for engineers and PMs course by Hamel Hussein and Shreya Shankar.\nThis live Maven course will teach you the battle-tested frameworks from Hamel and Shreya.\nWe're the engineers behind GitHub Copilot's evaluation system and 25 plus production AI implementations.\nFour weeks live instruction.\nNext cohort starts July 21st.\nStart shipping AI that actually works.\nEnroll at maven.com with my code ag-product-growth for over $800 off.\nThat's ag-pr-g o wt.\nToday's episode is brought to you by the AIPM certification on Maven run by McDad Jaffer, who is a product leader at OpenAI.\nThis is not your typical course.\nIt's 8 weeks of live cohort-based learning with the leader at one of the top companies in tech.\nOpenAI just doesn't stop shipping, and this is your chance to learn how.\nRun along with Product Faculty and Mo Ali, the course has a 4.9 rating with 133 reviews.\nFormer students come from companies like OpenAI, Shopify, Stripe, Google, and Meta.\nThe best part, your company can probably cover the cost.\nSo, if you want to get $500 off, use my code AA25 and head to maven.com/product-faculty.\nThat's m a v.com/p r o du ct-fac y.\nAnd for people who don't know, Vercel, as you can hear with the numbers, 186 people focused on this core business because you guys started that what, almost 10 years ago.\nAnd Vzero is really one of the newer things that you guys have built.\nYeah, that's right.\nAnd you know, it's really nice for us to be able to bootstrap things internally.\nVzero sort of operates like a startup within a startup, but it gets to build on top of the foundations that were laid by everything else we built.\nUm, so yeah, this is uh very related to how we build products is we want to lay the foundation, lay out a north star for where we want to go, and then use the foundation to build the incremental path to getting there.\nAnd is this a totally different user for you guys?\nIt sounds like it might be like a different user and buyer.\nHow do you guys kind of think about managing the difference?\nYeah.\nIs it okay if I stop sharing my screen?\nYep.\nYeah.\nUm, it kind of is.\nYeah.\nSo, I think developers for forever.\nUm, we are the developer company.\nWe love building tools for developers.\nWe are ourselves developers.\nBut the definition of developers getting a little bit wider.\nUm, it went from anybody who could build things using traditional software engineering techniques to anybody who wants to build things.\nUm, and that's been really fun to watch, especially internally.\nThe evolution that Vzero's provided is anybody who's sort of tech adjacent, anybody who knows this thing exists can build things.\nSo, you know, we do a demo day every Friday.\nWe do demo days.\nAnd demo days started out a couple years ago, engineers would show up and demo stuff.\nThen, you know, designers came in and designers would say like, &quot;Okay, we've got some mocks.\nWe're thinking about some things.\nWe're just demoing what we're thinking.&quot;\nProduct managers would come in and demo end-to-end flows of certain things, not just features.\nBut what's happened more recently is other parts of the business are coming in and demoing full-fledged applications.\nHere's my proposal for how we should build the new domains management experience.\nUm, one of my favorites was an account executive came in and said, &quot;Hey, you know, usually I jump on a call with a prospect and we go through total cost of ownership of buying Vercel.&quot;\nAnd usually I will send them a spreadsheet.\nUm, and the spreadsheet, you know, it's lots of rows and columns and numbers and tabs.\nThis time I dumped all of that data into VZero and I created an interactive application for them to filter and look at their own growth of their company based on their success over time.\nI would never have been able to take the time to do this because I'm talking to so many prospects.\nBut because I was able to build this one-time use software, the customer was so elated.\nThey're like, I can see it.\nI can understand how this is going to pay dividends for us.\nSo having account executives show up to demo days demoing products is amazing.\nThat's crazy.\nThere's so much that's possible with this, but you're in a very competitive space.\nIf I look at it, we had a Bolt CEO on the podcast.\nThere's Replit, there's Lovable, we've done some wind surf and cursor demos as well.\nHow do you think about competing in this space?\nH you know I helped build React and and people used to ask the same question about React.\nHow do you think about React's competition?\nAnd I gave the team the same direction always.\nUm I really don't think about the competition.\nI think about our customers and delivering as much value as I can.\nAnd I also think about my own use case, like I actually am building something that I am excited to use.\nSo look, it's tempting some competitor adds this feature or that and you're like, we've got to catch up.\nI don't want to play catchup.\nI just want to build things that continue to add value for ourselves.\nSeeing that account executive, that product manager, our head of internal communications builds things.\nNow, her feature requests that enable her to do her job better matter more to me than whatever feature some competitor is coming up with.\nSo, it's good to keep your finger on the pulse.\nYou want to make sure you're not missing a wave.\nUh, our CEO, Germo, makes sure that we stay at the tip of the spear of all the latest trends.\nI promise.\nUm, but I direct the team to really stay focused on delivering as much value as possible to ourselves as customers and to our customers of tools like VZero.\nYou mentioned React.\nYou're really well known for that.\nIf anybody searches you up, they'll find tons of things with you in React.\nWhat's interesting to me is that most of these apps in VZero are included, they tend to use React when they're building.\nIt seems like what does that make you feel?\nYeah, it's it's humbling for sure.\nI think when we started creating React, one of the things we loved was that it felt like it was lowering the barrier to entry for development.\nAnd because it did that, you saw a lot a lot more people building with React than were using other sort of libraries and frameworks at the time.\nAnd it picked up in popularity, I think honestly because it was more fun.\nBut because it picked up in in popularity, there's so many examples of open- source React applications out there.\nAnd I think the models have ended up being trained on lots and lots of React code.\nYou can certainly teach them to use other frameworks.\nAnd you know I think like even VZero you can say hey build this in SvelteKit and it does a great job, but by default it's like, well, I know the most about React because it's kind of ubiquitous at this point.\nSo, um, that was very surprising and and humbling for us.\nBut what I love about this next generation of tools is in the same way that React lowered the barrier to software development, these tools like VZero are lowering the barrier even further or dramatically further and the framework is becoming more of um more than ever before somewhat of an implementation detail if that makes sense.\nUm, frameworks were a construct that we made to enable the like sharing of code and the ability for many people, humans, to iterate on the same codebase using conventions and APIs and and now if I'm more and more able to sort of build all of this stuff myself and iterate quickly without fully understanding all of the complexity of the front-end code or at least not understanding it first, then the framework becomes something that can progressively disclosed over time.\nSo, um, yeah.\nAnyway, back to your question, I think like it's been it's been really humbling to see how React has become the sort of substrate layer underneath all of this.\nYeah, almost every time I'm really looking behind the code of these apps that these prototyping tools are building and they're using React.\nSpeaking of which, can we close the loop now because people really want to deploy apps and see the databases.\nCan we look back at our apps and close the loop on that step?\nOh, yeah.\nLet's look.\nLet me get back into here and sharing my screen.\nHere we go.\nAnd there we go.\nI think we've got it.\nYeah.\nHere you go.\nUh it looks like we've added a bunch of meetings that are in our database.\nNice.\nUh we've added a meeting creation form.\nOh, we've added a meeting creation form.\nLet me let me full screen this and we'll check it out.\nOf course, we have uh so let's do a quarterly review.\nUh this is a new meeting.\nWe'll do it April 23rd from 9 to 10 a.m. and it's going to be in person this time.\nSo, create meeting.\nOkay.\nZoom link or meeting room.\nUh I'm in a room called midnight.\nSo, let's do it in here.\nUh and then I'm going to add uh add my personal email address and see if it emails me.\nOh, I should not have disclosed that.\nUh, okay, success.\nMy meeting was created successfully.\nUh, let's see where it showed up.\nMeeting scheduled 15.\nUh, okay.\nWe would have to implement the the all meetings flow.\nOkay, I kind of want to deploy this one actually and just play with it for a while.\nUm, layout.\nYeah, view all meetings hasn't been implemented yet, but I assume that's where that would show up.\nI'm tempted to go into the database as well.\nUm, we also deployed our sneaker store here.\nSo, um, let's see.\nOkay.\nYeah, this just is live on the internet at nice vzneaker store 8.cell.app.\nUh, so anyone can go play with that one.\nSo, we haven't left people hanging.\nYou can connect it to database.\nYou can make it a live app.\nThat ends it for our live cooking session.\nWe showed you guys how you can build multiple apps.\nYou can use it oneshot new design.\nYou can use the prompt enhancement.\nAnd I think one of the key lessons here is that there is no particular right way.\nIt the way they've built you've built the chat.\nIt can handle a lot of different things.\nAnd I think that's part of the magic here is it's like chat GPT in that way.\nYou can give it a misworded response.\nYou can have a typo in your prompt and it'll still work with it.\nYeah, that's right.\nThat sort of flexibility and the fact that it kind of speaks to you in plain English.\nIt's like, oh, here's the thing that was missing.\nRemember, I had to copy in my environment variable.\nEventually, maybe we'll we'll make even that step go away.\nBut, uh, it kind of guides you and you can ask it plain English how to fix certain things for you.\nBut then at the end of this, you can deploy real software to the internet.\nAnd that's what we did.\nSo, somebody's watching this, maybe they're not as technical as you and I.\nThey weren't an engineer before.\nWhat else do they need to know if they want to take, let's say, that e-commerce store right there and make it into a million-dollar app?\nMake it into a million dollar app.\nYou know, one of the things I like that you mentioned earlier is like the PM skill set is as relevant as ever.\nUm, you got to build something that people are excited about and you can take that thing and you can iterate on it until it's something that you're excited about and then you can share it with somebody else and and get them excited about it.\nBut all the rest of the work of creating something valuable still exists.\nThis isn't a sort of like, oh, I've I've just yoloed something out into the into the internet, so now I'm going to get a million users.\nUm, I think actually what's going to happen as the time to development um and iteration velocity goes up, time to development goes down, I think actually the products that deliver real value are going to be the ones that don't really play games.\nThey're like, &quot;Okay, this actually helped me do something now that I couldn't do before.&quot;\nSo, the PM skill set is as relevant as ever.\nAnd uh actually finding ways to deliver real value to real people is the only way to get adoption.\nUh so you'll you'll do marketing, you'll do you'll go talk to people, you do user research, you'll iterate on your product based on feedback.\nUm and the way that you iterate is a little different, but the rest of the job has to be done.\nAnd what should people know about scaling and iterating?\nShould they stay within VZero?\nCan it handle all of the scaling that might be needed to scale to that level, handling thousands or tens of thousands of users, or should they eventually move into kind of like a IDE or something like that to handle a larger and growing code base?\nYeah, I think um it really depends.\nIf you're starting out as a developer, you'll probably want to uh sort of eject into your editor, you know, connect things, make changes, and iterate from there, collaborate with your team, back it by a Git repository, etc.\nUm, if you're starting out as not a developer, you're just learning development, you maybe want to stay in the browser in VZero for as long as you can.\nUm, but it, you know, either way, what you deploy is real software.\nWhen you deploy from Vercel, uh, from Vzero into Vercel's managed infrastructure, this will scale to a billion users.\nUm, and so it really is about attracting your users and building something that, you know, gets gets real traction.\n\n\nUm, it's not necessarily about the tools themselves holding you back. The thing that I love about a Vercel project is that again, it's backed by a real Vercel project, which has, you know, OpenAI.com and all of these other, you know, Chick-fil-A's operations and UnderArmour.com. These are real products with real scale. And so, they're all backed by Vercel's infrastructure the same way that the thing that you just vibe coded would be backed by Vercel's infrastructure.\n\nAwesome. So, I want to peel back the curtain since you are the Chief Product Officer. It's rare to get an opportunity to talk to Unicorn CPO, pick their brain, understand how they're running their product team. So, what is unique about how Vercel builds product? Yeah. So, you know, by way of clarification, I think CPO in title, but I run engineering, product, and design. So we can talk about engineering as well, and as a former engineer myself, I think that's kind of where that comes from. Um, my counterpart is our CTO, Malta Ubel. He's an individual contributor and gets to go deep on everything, and so we partner really, really well. He goes deep on the tech, and then I help manage the org. Um, yeah, the way that we build products, uh, you know, where do you want to start?\n\nWell, I guess planning is the most interesting thing. Like how do you even, how does the Vercel teams, for instance, planning? These are the big rock features we want to do. Are they doing it on a quarterly time frame? What fidelity? Are they building a Vercel prototype to show it? Yeah. Um, we do, uh, first of all, organization. Uh, we organize ourselves into product areas, and we have, you know, somewhere between 12 and 15 product areas. Each of those product areas contains a number of products. Each of those products contains features as you'd expect. And each of those product areas has a leads team. So there'll be the leads for the domains product area, and they'll be the leads for the compute product area. And what we expect of the leads, uh, which are multi, you know, cross-functional, so engineering, product, and design in the leads for each of these product areas, is we expect that they are owning their roadmap and checking in very, very frequently. We do a more formalized, uh, planning process every six months or so, just to kind of reset and figure out if everything that we're working on is still relevant. If there's anything that's new, we want to make sure we're missing a big boulder over here, we want to go after, etc. Um, but then we check in very frequently. So, six months worth of plans. I mean, the everything is moving so quickly. There's no way that you could plan for six months at a time. So, we'll do um, reviews a few days a week. We do at least two times a week. We'll have these reviews where teams can come in and do a kickoff check-in. Okay, here's our hypothesis. Here's what we're going to build. They can do an execution check-in. So, they can say, \"Okay, we've now been building for a little while. Here's what we're seeing. You know, we're going to continue,\" or they can do like a pre-ship check-in. So, like we're about to launch, here's all the things we need to consider from a pricing and enablement and go-to-market perspective. Um, so we do very regular check-ins with these product areas. We organize our Slack around these things. We organize um, our meetings and our, uh, you know, hack weeks and things around product areas as well.\n\nGot it. Is there anything unique or interesting about your planning operating system? Are you doing it, you know, in Notion with lots of impact sizing? Are you doing it with OKRs, or is it just a pretty normal planning process? Yeah, we do use Notion pretty heavily for this, and then, you know, projects that are enumerated in Notion, and we size them, and we map them back to customer requests, etc. Then, you know, once we get into execution, we'll actually go into Linear. Um, both great tools for this. Um, I think, you know, Notion gives us the ability to connect to the rest of the organization. So one thing I like is we'll have like a PRD that actually comes from the field engineering team that then maps into an engineering initiative or a product initiative, and so we can kind of cross-reference lots of different types of materials that all ladder up to a singular initiative. Um, we take pride in our sort of Slack ops. So making sure that the relationship between Notion and Slack and Linear is all very cohesive. Um, but that's mostly about execution. I think for planning, we produce planned summaries for every product area, and then I create like a, you know, if that's the L3, then I'll create the L2, here's my overall summary, then I'll create the L1 for the executive team, which is like, here's everything you need to know that's happening. Um, some version of that we'll share with customers. It'll be customer-facing, and we'll take it to our customer advisory board, and we'll talk to prospects about what's happening soon. Um, but yeah, our planning process is pretty fluid. Um, we don't have a formalized OKR process. We tried one out about two a year and a half ago. Um, I don't, I don't want to say there was organ rejection, but I just want to say it was overfit.\n\nUm, for what we needed. Vercel is what I describe as lowercase a agile. Um, we are moving quickly. We are jumping from um, initiative over here to the next thing that comes up over here, um, pretty, pretty quickly, and so a formalized process felt like it was actually holding us back from being able to move a lot faster.\n\nSo now I want to know how the Vercel team uses Vercel because I think AI prototyping has blurred a lot of the lines, right? PMs are getting into early versions of designs, designers are maybe iterating in Vercel sometimes, not all the time in Figma before they go to Figma, and then maybe engineers are even using Vercel to kick off their engineering. Is that how it works on your team, or how are you guys using Vercel? Yeah, I mean, as a company, we're using it many, many different ways. On the Vercel team, the way they're using it is obviously they do a lot of just building personal software, and they're just tinkering, and they're dogfooding, and they're using it and giving each other feedback and making it better and better. But the other way that they use it that's perhaps different than what we showed earlier is they'll design one small piece of the app using Vercel. So like, oh, I need the project settings drawer. And so they'll say like, here's all the context on this project that we're building in. Um, and then they'll end up generating something that they then import into the actual Vercel itself. So Vercel is a massive application, as you can imagine. You can't oneshot a full fidelity Vercel. But what you can oneshot is like the settings page that you then iterate on. And so you iterate rather than iterating in code, you can iterate in Vercel. So that's another thing that the Vercel team does. Um, more generally speaking, how we use Vercel as a company. I mean, we went into some examples, but everybody's using it for stuff that we wouldn't have even thought about. Um, we build slide decks in Vercel now because it's easier to, you know, dump all the content that you want from a doc and then, you know, here, generate a slide deck for this, and then you can actually walk through a real slide deck without even going into, you know, a slide editor. So, we use it for absolutely everything internally. Okay.\n\nAnd specifically on the role of prototyping, like how should a PM think about prototyping? Should the prototype be replacing their PRD? Should it be after they have the PRD and it's been okayed in planning, then they go into the prototype phase? When do you really think about using AI prototyping to use it at its fullest? Yeah, in my mind, like the sooner you can demo and validate your hypothesis, the better. Um, PRDs still play a role. I actually think that you can't capture, you know, all of the nuance and all of the edge case and the strategy, um, in the demo, but I do think these things like the PRD can get a little thinner now, and it can be more high level, more strategic, more opportunity sizing, um, more, you know, analysis, and then the demo is what really, you know, a picture is worth a thousand words. Um, the mantra that we have is seeing is believing. So, you know, you used to be able to do this in a PRD. You could embed screenshots and different views and things like that. But, um, I think the real software will expose the edge cases a bit more quickly and kind of, you know, make it more real for people. I think it's also just more, it's more enjoyable to watch somebody give a demo of a thing versus just talk through either a slide deck or a doc. So, it's a more engaging feedback session when you're kind of demoing something. But, yeah, there's, there's kind of room for both. And they, I think they complement each other really well. A picture is a thousand words. A prototype is 10,000 words, right? You actually get to interact with the picture. So it's kind of the level up. And that's why I've been encouraging more and more PMs, more and more designers to get their hands on tools like this.\n\nWhat are the biggest Vercel features you guys have shipped recently? Yeah, I think integrations is the big one. I mean, that's that's very new. We tried two separate integrations, an AI integration and a database. Um, but we're also bringing the full power of the Vercel marketplace here. So eventually, we're going to have things like observability, um, off, uh, you know, anything that your application, a modern application needs, you'll be able to procure it through the marketplace in two clicks. And I think that, you know, we take it for granted now how quickly I went through the flow of creating a net new account with the underlying provider, provisioning a resource, wiring up billing. In my cases, I chose, uh, free to get started, but like billing was also wired up, SSO. So integrations is the biggest feature we've added to Vercel, and I think it actually really unlocks real applications versus the prototypes of even just a few months ago.\n\nSo walk us through in depth the story of that integrations feature. How did you guys roadmap it? Did the Vercel teams pitch it back to you? How did you guys prioritize which integrations you were going to build? Yeah. How did you use Vercel within that process?\n\nYeah. So again, integrations builds on top of the Vercel marketplace. So we could do what you just described for that, which was a much bigger initiative from the past year, 18 months. Um, but in terms of Vercel, I think what they actually did was they started with um, the foundations that already existed, and then they, they did, they went right into prototyping the flow. So with Vercel, they said, here's what we think, here's where we think the button should go, and when you click it, here's the behavior we think that you want. A big piece of what we wanted to make work was the generative UI piece of pasting in the URL. So if you saw that, it's like, sure, you could have directed me to go into the code and paste the URL into the code, the database URL, but we really wanted to make that seamless and in line. So there's a structured input for copying in environment variables. Um, and we'll make even those even more seamless, but we prototyped that flow within Vercel. So it's just very meta. Um, but yeah, the team kind of um, had a list of all of the strategic new features that were either a combination of requests or things that we knew we wanted. And then we sequenced, we like ranked those. We have limited resources, so we ranked those features. And then we actually did do a early demo day of like, here's what we think it should look like. We had a review where we talked about um, the what we think this would unlock and how we want to position it. Um, and yeah, there actually for that one, there wasn't a PRD for integrations. It really was almost exclusively demos and, uh, Loom videos and, you know, conversation.\n\nSo, demos, Loom videos, and it sounds like a couple key review meetings is how you were able to create all of the canvas for collaboration. You didn't even need a PRD. It was one of those features where people understood the impact. They understood the strategy, and so you didn't have to write that, which I think is the perfect example of how product development should look in this modern day and age. So let's say you were talking to your colleague. Let's say they're a CPO at a slower-moving company, cuz it sounds like Vercel, you guys are embracing AI, right? You guys build these key AI products. Makes sense. But a lot of companies, they're not embracing AI, right? I'd say 80, 90% of companies, they're not. They're just now getting their engineers on cursor maybe. Whether their PMs have a Vercel license, suspect, right? Yeah. What's your, when you're talking to those CPO friends, you know, what's your advice for them? How should they be thinking about the new way of product development enabled by AI?\n\nI mean, the first thing that I would tell them is that it's actually really fun. So, like this isn't a stressful transformation you need to dread. Um, just start tinkering, you know, just build something, and you'll start to see it yourself. But I will say that like the more existential thing here is like everybody's moving really fast, and if we believe that iteration velocity solves all known, uh, software problems, or maybe all known problems, um, you're kind of going to be left behind, um, if you're not at least tinkering and getting started. Um, I think that the idea that companies, you know, AI right now is being bolted on as a feature for lots of companies. Um, that's not how AI is going to work. AI is going to be part of the fabric of how every company operates and every product they sell. Right now, there's literally an AI button. AI has an icon, right? The little sparkle stars, right? But eventually, AI is not going to have a button. It's not going to be a thing that you plan, okay, what's our AI roadmap? It's just going to be what's our roadmap, and AI is going to be infused into all of it. So if you're not using AI and seeing the ways in which that it's transforming your own workflow and your own experience, how will you be able to transform your customers user experience, uh, in a, in a sort of like tasteful and balanced and modern way? So yeah, I mean, my advice is obviously start, start tink\n\n\nering.\nYesterday, um, and incorporate, you know, in small doses.\nWe don't have to go, uh, you know, 180 degrees.\nWe weren't using any AI.\nNow we're doing everything with AI.\nBut, um, I think we should take the shift pretty seriously.\nAnd are there any steps they should be thinking about if they want to buy their PM team Vzero licenses?\nLike, what are the common concerns that come up and how you address them?\nYeah, this is interesting.\nSo, um, in the engineering space, it's quite saturated.\nWe started selling Vzero, uh, licenses to enterprises, and they're like, \"Okay, yeah, but there's, we're paying for this other tool, we have this, we have this, um...\"\nBut it turns out that there's significantly less friction for PMs, designers, um, and what I would describe as like, dev-adjacent folks.\nSo, um, we can do this like very start, very small, you know, we just have a couple of seats.\nWe're going to just get some of our folks online, and we're going to try this out for a while.\nUm, I would say start there.\nI think it's, it's totally reasonable to want to try something out before you commit and go all in for like years, times, thousands of people.\nUm, but I also think you can develop some conviction about the way that you'll use it even just from the free tier.\nSo, you, um, before you bring it into your company, you just start using it yourself, and then you think about the ways in which it transforms your workflow.\nIf you need to justify buying it internally, I think anytime anybody does the Vzero demo of, \"Here's how my job gets a little bit easier, and here's how I become a little bit more efficient.\"\nUm, it's always a no-brainer.\nI mean, the value for price is just outrageous.\nSo, um, yeah, I mean, how do, how do you get started?\nI would just say develop your own conviction about the ways in which it'll transform your own workflow.\nWhat are the integrations you'll use?\nWhat are the, what days will it show up?\nIn what meetings will a Vzero generation show up that previously you'd present a doc, a slide deck, or something else?\nUm, and then you know that has turned into quite a bit of traction actually for our enterprise customers, especially.\nAwesome.\nSo we covered Vzero, how Vercel builds product, the future of product management with AI.\nI want to talk a little bit about you.\nSo you were an engineer for your whole career.\nUh, you joined Vercel as a VP of engineering.\nNow you've become chief product officer.\nWhat was that transition like?\nYeah, engineer by trade.\nUm, I transitioned into engineering management, and then I was an engineer for about a decade at Facebook.\nUm, engineering director, more, you know, toward the tail end, leading quite large initiatives.\nAnd so when I joined Vercel, it was really about bringing some of the infrastructure and developer infrastructure that, uh, companies like Facebook and Google had, bringing that to the rest of the world.\nAnd we can go into why.\nSo starting as an engineering leader just made perfect sense.\nWe already had a VP of engineering.\nWe decided we were going to split engineering in two.\nThe hypothesis was like, it's very logical to have an infrastructure organization and then a product engineering organization or, um, platform.\nSome, some teams call it that.\nUm, and in my mind, that was, that was the role.\nI was just going to help with engineering leadership, and I was excited about it.\nAnd shortly after I joined, uh, we collectively as an extended leadership team identified a bigger opportunity.\nThe bigger opportunity was to get engineering, product, design, and a handful of other functions operating as a single unit.\nAnd there was no single threaded owner for all of this.\nAnd so you'd kind of hear different things depending on which function you talked to.\nAnd at the same time, G had been pushing us to become more design-led, seeing as believing was a principle.\nUm, but design was downstream of the assembly line process of development.\nEngineers are cooking over here and then sprinkling a little design on it, and hopefully product managers are shepherding some of this work along.\nSo, we actually had a conversation about, uh, restructuring all of R&D, um, which is engineering, product, and design, um, under me to, to sort of carve out these pillars, but ensure that they're all operating as a single, cohesive unit and serving the rest of the organization better.\nI think it's very hard for the go-to-market organization to know who to talk to.\nShould I talk to the head of engineering, the head of product, or the head of design?\nThey're all telling me slightly different things.\nThey're saying we're working on the same stuff, but they're framing it in slightly different ways.\nSo, yeah, we transitioned me into the chief product officer role, leading all of EPD.\nUm, and since then, I think some things have been going a bit smoother, but yeah, I'm an engineer by trade.\nUm, I have been, uh, learning product and design to a lesser extent on the job and obviously supported by an amazing team.\nWhat's your advice to engineering leaders who want to make a similar shift to become PM leaders?\nYou know, the first thing that the, the moment I saw the light, uh, I was actually still an engineering manager.\nI wasn't even a director.\nUm, I saw the opportunity for me as an engineering manager to take certain work off the plates of my engineers that I thought was critical, but which they didn't enjoy as much as I did.\nAnd at the time it was user research, talking to customers, writing up the document that explained the strategy for what the engineering team was building while they were burning through ticket lists, you know, like their task lists.\nAnd I just called that engineering management because my team happened to be a team that was building developer tools, and we didn't really have many product managers allocated to developer tools.\nSo when I eventually came into like leading a product organization, I sort of created a cleaner split between the roles and responsibilities.\nBut one thing remains: the product managers have to be part of the team.\nYou have to have complete trust of the engineers and your sort of counterpart engineering management, tech lead, designer, etc.\nAnd so I really try to foster a relationship between, we were talking about those product area leaders.\nI really try to foster a very collaborative relationship there where the Venn diagram of jobs I'm good at and jobs that need to be done for each of the folks is sort of has a heavy overlap.\nUm, but I do think about product management as an extension of engineering, or in many ways, um, it is the engineering and then the programming as an implementation detail of the engineering, if that makes sense.\nI love that framing.\nIt is the engineering, especially in the Vzero world that we just demoed for you guys.\nSo I think that's really important.\nWhat's the story of landing this job?\nA lot of people want to land a VP job at a unicorn, an AI unicorn like Vercel.\nHow did you do it?\nYeah, I think, you know, my history in the space certainly helped quite a bit.\nUm, I initially was not looking to go back to work right away.\nUm, my story was there's a bunch of great people here that some of them came from my org.\nThere was a couple people from my org that that had moved on, but some of which I've just admired from afar.\nSo, when, uh, I was thinking about going back to work, it was like, okay, there's just, there's really only a very small number of companies that I would entertain.\nAnd then it became about how do I complement the existing set of skills that you already have?\nWhat are the things that I'm good at, um, and that I enjoy doing?\nThose are different, different buckets, but what are the things that I enjoy doing and I'm good at that would actually complement and round out the rest of, for example, Vercel's leadership team was what I was looking at.\nAnd I think, um, G and I are, are sort of yin and yang.\nUm, he is much more technical than me.\nHe is a much better engineer than me, but I'm technical enough to, you know, sort of influence and, um, keep up with all of the technology and conversations there.\nBut the thing that I've spent 10 years, well, now more than that, but at the time had spent, you know, 10 years doing was, uh, engineering management and people management and leadership and performance management and, um, cross-functional partnership.\nSo whereas he was an engineer by trade and an engineer as a CEO, I was sort of like a, a people leader.\nI had designed and built organizations that were designed and built to serve a purpose and to build something.\nAnd so we complemented each other in that way.\nSo to anybody else looking to land one of these roles, find the ways in which you complement the existing leaders on the team and you augment and and sort of enhance in in various ways that they wouldn't be able to do on their own potentially.\nUm, I also think you have to work on something that's true to who you are.\nIn many ways, React has been my life's work.\nI believe that Next.js and Vercel are an extension of the problem that I was trying to solve with React, which was I want to level up the quality of software on the internet.\nI want open platforms to win.\nI want the web to win.\nAnd Vercel was just so aligned with all of that.\nAnd even if you watch Guillermo Rauch speak in the early days of, uh, Vercel and Next.js, it was always about the web and always bet on React and all these things.\nSo I found a company that was very aligned with, um, the work that I had been doing for so long, um, and the leadership team of which I felt like I complemented and added something.\nUm, it was a rigorous interview process, but at the end of the day, I think it was, uh, a very good match.\nAnd how did it get it started?\nDid they reach out to you?\nDid you apply?\nBecause I feel like at these high-level roles, it's all kind of shrouded in secrecy.\nNobody knows.\nYeah, for me, um, it actually was, I was sort of a referral, uh, from somebody who was already here.\nUm, and he actually orchestrated the first conversation for me to have with, uh, the CEO.\nUm, and I think that person had known of me, obviously, because of my work and my experience.\nSo, um, I was actually a referral from somebody that I had used to work with, and and that person identified, \"Hey, we need more of this.\nUm, this is the, the type of thing that we're missing.\"\nAnd so that's actually where the conversation started.\nThe hook was actually, um, the CEO was perhaps testing me, but he, he challenged me on something that I believed in, and he sort of compelled me to write a very detailed, you know, explanation of my position on something.\nAnd he was like, \"Okay, you should interview for this role.\"\nAnd so I was being interviewed before I was being interviewed, if that makes sense.\nOh, very cool.\nSo, the old thing of impressing your co-workers when you work at a place like Meta, they end up going to awesome places, they recommended you, and then when somebody reaches out like Guillermo Rauch, thoughtfully responding because he's kind of interviewing you before the interview started.\nYeah.\nAnd I wasn't looking for a new role at that point either.\nI, that was kind of the hook that made me say like, \"Okay, maybe I'll interview.\"\nVery cool.\nVery cool.\nSo you were at Meta before this.\nThat was your life's work.\nWhat was a day in the life like at Meta?\nI mean, it really depended.\nYou know, I started out as a new grad engineer building user-facing features.\nUm, I helped build the \"what's on your mind\" box.\nMe and a guy named Kyle, uh, you know, back when we switched from, uh, having just text posts to having, you know, photo uploads and and video and other, you know, events and things you could create.\nUm, I worked on search.\nA day in the life as an engineer was, you know, we worked with a product manager, we burned through our task list, eventually we would identify, you know, higher-level opportunities and products that we wanted to build.\nWhen I got into engineering management, um, I was very fortunate to work on developer tools.\nSo I sort of moved away from directly influencing the product, probably in 2011, 12, um, and started working on tools that enabled other developers to build products and move faster with higher quality.\nWe had a team called product infrastructure that was all about, um, you know, the, a day in the life there was all about identifying bottlenecks for engineers and then figuring out ways to move them out of the way and and speed everything up.\nEventually as an engineering director, I was overseeing, uh, React and the family of technologies that cropped up around it as well as a team called webcore.\nBut the thing that I, that seeded all of that, uh, was I created a team called JavaScript infrastructure, um, and built that team that turned into React and so much more.\nAnd, uh, then also I inherited something called webcore, and we rebuilt facebook.com on top of the technologies that I was building on the other side.\nSo a day in the life, you know, started out writing a lot of code, then it was a lot of meetings, then it was a lot of meetings with PRDs and strategy sessions and, um, but always working on developer-facing tools.\nI think my biggest contribution was probably convincing the company to open source React.\nI think it was at a time when people weren't convinced that open source was a good idea in general.\nUm, I was very passionate about open source because of where I came from.\nSo, a day in the life like that was a bunch of meetings where I'm convincing the company that open source makes sense and here's why.\nUm, but yeah, maybe a little bit of a seedling for Mark to open source everything they're doing in AI later.\nAbsolutely.\nI mean, their, their open approach to Llama has been seeded from the success of open source projects like React.\nOpen Compute was transformative back in the day, if anybody wants to go look up Open Compute, and also PyTorch.\nUm, it wasn't clear that PyTorch was going to be the way that we train AI, um, at the time.\nThere was a, it was a pretty saturated space, but open sourcing it and really investing in the community, um, is what made PyTorch so successful.\nSo I think they're carrying that forward with open sourcing the models.\nI would love to see them open source even more.\nSo, I want to end a little bit on future casting because I think you're uniquely positioned to do this.\nYou've spent so much time in engineering.\nYou now lead product design and engineering at one of the hottest AI companies.\nWhat do you see as the future of engineering, design, and PM?\nWe talked a lot about how those Venn diagrams are getting closer and closer.\nWhat does the future look like in the world of AI?\nYeah, one of the things I've loved to see is the rise of the design engineer.\nUm, and I think we're going to see a rise of the sort of PM engineer as well.\nUm, I think that these roles are going to overlap more and more as the tools become more sophisticated and complement our existing skill set.\nUm, I was an okay programmer.\nUm, I love coding, but I was never the best.\nAwesome.\nUm, thank you.\nThe way that I used to augment my engineering is, um, I would\n\n\nWork with other engineers that were better engineers than me and augment their engineering.\nSo I would do integration and testing and migrations, and uh, I would, I was very obsessed with UX.\nSo I would spend a lot of time on the pixels and the details.\nUm, and so I had other humans that complemented my skill set, and together the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.\nI think that AI tools are going to provide every individual with that complement.\nIf you're very good at engineering, you're probably going to want to keep programming, but now AI is going to help you with design.\nIf you're very good at design, AI is going to help you with implementation.\nSo, I think we're going to see the the fusing together of these roles.\nAnd a lot of folks are going to be in these interesting hybrid roles where maybe you don't own the entirety of the product yourself end to end, but you really get to focus more of your time on the thing that you're good at and that you enjoy and less of your time on the what I used to describe as the tax associated with your job.\nLike, oh, I have to go write a PRD or I have to go make a mock um or I have to go do this.\nSo, I think that's going to be the evolution of um a lot of industries.\nUh, AI is going to augment us and be good at the things that we are not as good at or that we don't enjoy as much.\nSo, we talked a lot about vzero and AI prototyping and how they impact these things.\nMore generally, what are the other AI things you're using as a CPO in your day-to-day that help you?\nYeah, some of the tools I've been super impressed with.\nUm, super impressed with Granola AI.\nI think it's like a very transformative way to think about meetings.\nThe the prompt is this, like I wish I could go back and talk to that person and ask them for more details on this.\nYou can ask questions about a past meeting.\nIt's just it's super powerful.\nI use chat GBT just like everybody else.\nI love it for, you know, small things and big.\nIt's basically replaced my usage of Google now.\nAnd I I I find that I don't need internet searches as much.\nI really want the sort of um you know I I'm just thinking about this or what's the answer to that?\nSo using chat GBT a lot.\nI mean those are the big ones.\nUm I also you know have fun generating images and and and media and stuff.\nSo I'm like tinkering with with the fun side of things as well.\nVzero is the tool I use the most just because I love just tinkering and building stuff.\nAs builders I think it has unlimited possibilities.\nThank you so much for highlighting them today and being on the podcast.\nThank you so much for having me.\nGreat chatting with you.\nBye everyone.\nI really hope you guys enjoyed that episode.\nIt would mean a ton to me and the team if you could please subscribe on YouTube, follow on Apple and Spotify podcasts, and leave a rating and review.\nThose ratings and reviews really help grow the show and help other people discover the show and they help fund the production so that we can do bigger and better productions.\nCan't wait to share the next episode with you.\nUntil then, see you\n",
