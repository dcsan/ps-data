  "cleanText": "How are you guys prioritizing what those engineers work on together? Are you guys building a road map together on some sort of cadence, deciding sprints or any of those things normal tech companies do? I feel like it's pretty obvious when you have so many users. Like literally when we started Cluey, we just said, \"Let's build the most general version of interview coder.\" We built interview coder for everything and we've given it like a very controversial marketing flare and called it cheat on everything. And now we have like literally millions of requests coming in a day that literally tell us how people are using Cluey. And we have like hundreds of customer emails saying like, \"Hey, this is what I hate about Cluey.\" And like like, \"Okay, okay, now I know, but we need to fix it.\" Roy Lee is one of the smartest and richest 21-year-olds you'll meet. With his company, Cluey raising $15 million series A last week. At typical dilution levels, he would be worth eight figures. What does Cluey make? AI that helps you cheat on interviews and tests. AI that can't be detected but can listen to your computer audio and read your screen. What do I need to know about your early years to understand the Roy that's sitting in front of me today? I think the single most defining character feature of me from the second I gained consciousness was um provocative. So you've been kicked out of not one but kind of two schools with Columbia as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. After that one time like you get kicked out of school once and it sort of like really popsens your mind and really makes you rethink like do I even need school in the first place? Talk about being at the top of the timeline. You guys are the main characters in the X for you page right now. How does that feel? It feels like I have all these assumptions about virality and I've spent months wondering like, man, I wonder why X feels so different from Instagram, TikTok. One of the most interesting things I saw recently on Twitter was people claimed your system prompt was leaked. I have that up on green right now. Is this what was actually your system prompt? Really quickly, I think a crazy stat is that more than 50% of you listening are not subscribed. If you can subscribe on YouTube, follow on Apple or Spotify podcasts, my commitment to you is that we'll continue to make this content better and better. And now on to today's episode. Welcome to the podcast. Thanks for having me, brother. What do I need to know about your early years to understand the Roy that's sitting in front of me today? I think the single most defining character feature of me from like literally the second I gained consciousness was um provocative. Uh like literally since elementary school, kindergarten, there's been a camp of people who have been like avid Roy supporters and a camp of people who have been Roy haters. Every single time I've had a thought that's entered my mind, I've said it out loud publicly and like very brazenly. And this has like burned me and helped me many times. This has uh gotten me, you know, like like in school leadership positions at clubs and a bunch of people who love me, like a solid friend group. And it's also gotten me, you know, like like suspensions from school, spend like every other s every other Saturday and Saturday school and like a bunch a million detentions. And it even eventually got me like kicked out of Harvard. So, um there there's been a lot of like like burns and a lot of gains from me being the polarizing person that I am. You were kicked out of Harvard? Yeah. Yeah. Senior year of high school, I um got into Harvard early as probably a result of me doing all this crazy. Um and later that like like I had a suspension for sneaking out of a field trip. Um and later that year there was a camp of Roy haters who didn't like all the brazen crazy that I did. Um they they they mass reported me and and it ended up getting me suspended rescended from Harvard. Wow. So you've been kicked out of not one but kind of two schools with Columbia as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean after that after that one time like you get kicked out of school once and it sort of like really toughens your mind and really makes you rethink like do I even need school in the first place? And after that first time I got rescended like my mind was locked onto okay I've always been unconventional and I've always been successful at things that I've done. I need to channel this into like the biggest boldest play ever and that's like building a company bro. Building a company indeed. And last time you shared the stats it was at 5 million ARR. What's the latest for Cluey's growth? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're we're we're almost at six. So we're we're we're going we're growing quite quickly. And I think um one thing that people don't don't realize and often forget is uh like we wrote the first line of code for Cluey like 10 weeks ago. Um we are earlier stage than like most YC companies of the latest batch. Uh but it's it's hard to remember that because it feels like we've been on top of the timeline forever, but um it's just a function of a really worldclass amazing marketing team. Talk about being at the top of the timeline. You guys are the main characters in the X for you page right now. How does that feel? It's pretty crazy and it's really really I'd say like vindicating. Not No, I I I I think crazy is the most general and and and specific that that this feeling can get. But it feels like I have all these assumptions about virality and I've spent months wondering like, man, I wonder why X feels so different from Instagram, TikTok. if it's like on Instagram, TikTok, there's creators who have cracked the algorithm. I wonder why the tech Twitter feed looks so different. Like why don't people apply these concepts on Twitter and just go hyper viral like they should. Um, and I've had all these assumptions and as soon as I started implementing them, like they started working immediately and to like a massive scale. Like I've literally become the main character of Tech Twitter in the span of a few weeks. Like a few weeks of pressing the button that I feel like is so obvious and clear to everyone. Um, and it feels crazy that nobody else has caught on. It feels like I genuinely am pioneering something. What have the millennials like me, what are we not understanding about your approach to virality? I think what people don't understand is that short form like these algorithms reward what is most controversial. and people on X LinkedIn like these are nerdy tech bros who want to appear smart or like like like thoughtprovoking and they'll write these long essays that maybe like 200 people in the world can understand and like an attempt to appear smart but in reality the algorithm rewards things that are digestible controversial and force people to have an opinion about and for some reason people on X LinkedIn just have not caught on about like what are the best ways I can I can grow my company and like like bring visibility to my company and doing this and it's it's just like like obviously like the nerdy tech bros that grow up and start tech companies. These are just not the same people that will be scrolling on Instagram, Instagram, TikTok and just be caught up on the latest in cultural trends. But um I think I am part of a new generation of founder that that has like I've grown up on on on this. Yeah, we grew up on Facebook and stuff and I think it was always about like presenting your best self. Even on LinkedIn, it's like about presenting this curated version of yourself, but you're willing to present kind of a more controversial side. How do you correctly create content that's controversial but still drives to your product? Today's episode is brought to you by the AIPM Certification on Maven run by McDad Jaffer who is a product leader at OpenAI. This is not your typical course. It's 8 weeks of live cohort-based learning with the leader at one of the top companies in tech. OpenAI just doesn't stop shipping and this is your chance to learn how. Run along with Product Faculty and Mo Ali. The course has a 4.9 rating with 133 reviews. Former students come from companies like OpenAI, Shopify, Stripe, Google, and Meta. The best part, your company can probably cover the cost. So, if you want to get $500 off, use my code AA25 and head to maven.com/product-faculty. That's mavn.com/pect-fac. Today's episode is brought to you by Jira Product Discovery. If you're like most product managers, you're probably in Jira, tracking tickets and managing the backlog. But what about everything that happens before delivery? Jira Product Discovery helps you move your discovery, prioritization, and even road mapping work out of spreadsheets and into a purpose-built tool designed for product teams. Capture insights, prioritize what matters, and create road maps you can easily tailor for any audience. And because it's built to work with Jira, everything stays connected from idea to delivery. Used by product teams at Canva, Deliveroo, and even The Economist. Check out why and try it for free today at atlassian.com/product-discovery. That's at lsn.com/product-discovery. Jurroduct discovery. Build the right thing. I think this is something that less people have to worry about. Like there's way too many people that worry about a highly converting marketing funnel and all this but in reality, there's no one else out there with more brand visibility than me. And there's probably not a company out there that would not die for to have this sort of visibility on their product, especially at this early stage of being like 2 and a half months um in. And um I think it's really hard to put a monetary value on this because how exactly can you track all the conversions from literally being the the main character of of tech? Like it's impossible. More than that, the the formats that will be viral, these change like literally overnight overnight you need to know the new thing that will be viral. And you have no in if if your content is changing literally every week. Then how are you supposed to like if you find a winning content format? It's not really like you can rinse and repeat it because in a month that's expired and it's not viral anymore. You just have to keep iterating and trying new things. And I think it's pointless to track conversions on bull and then like like that because uh if you just know, hey, my product is visible here. If I was a consumer and I saw this and I saw this video, I would actually be incentivized. there's an actual call to action here, then the video will be converting and you don't have to worry about it because even if you discover, oh, it's converting and it's like like roughly like a $2.73 second like like like like it's it's it's all it's all noise, bro. Like like in a month the numbers mean nothing and they're expired. The growth marketer and me died inside a little bit hearing that perhaps. Yeah. I mean like like m maybe I'm wrong, but it's really you cannot put a dollar value on the the visibility that we have right now. It's crazy. Yeah, I would say you guys are easily the best distributing startup at the series A or B range. If you were to break down this strategy for your friend who wanted to kind of copy your playbook, what would be the key elements? A lot of people don't know, but we're averaging like in in our first month of UGC on Instagram, we've done like we're probably on track to do like 50 million views a month. Um it's not just X LinkedIn that we're viral in. We're like pretty much viral everywhere. And uh there's things like the the one thing that you need to understand I think is that since 5 years ago uh short form content has surpassed long form content in views and and and and usage and this has resulted in a world where the number of content creators has stayed the same but the number of content consumed has about 100xed. As a result, there is not enough viral content in the world for a consumer to consume. What does that mean? That means that as a as a consumer, you're scrolling on TikTok waiting for more things to see, but instead you're met with the same Minecraft subway surfers meme on a Reddit story. Like, you see that a hundred times because there's literally not enough quality viral content out there for you to see. Meaning, right now is a unique moment in human history where if you make a post or say something that deserves to be seen by millions, you will be seen by millions. And this is probably like like the most unique unique moment in human history. And I think I think something that everyone needs to know is uh you need to make more content with the potential to go viral. And this is sort of like like a dual threaded thing. Um and this is this is what I try and harp on every single time. Uh the components of virality at least on X LinkedIn are a it has to be digestible. This is a problem that almost everybody gets wrong like your content is not digestible. You cannot imagine that everyone you have you have to imagine that if everyone in America saw your tweet they would understand what you're talking about. But almost nobody on Twitter does this. um all their content is just like like like unexplainable blockchain, crypto, web 3, AI like like no nobody will understand this so it will not go viral. That's the first thing. And the second thing is you need people to have a reaction to it. You can't just post something and expect like like nobody wants to see just a regular post like you you have to really picture the world where someone quote posts your your tweet and the quote post is viral. What would a quote post say? If you cannot think of something then you need to change your original post because it needs to be engageable. Um, and th those are the components to virality. And if you you have that those two things, it's digestible and it's reactionable. And you you turn out even like one of those a day, like you will just end up on the top of the timeline. And that that is what constitutes virality. You're doing a lot of stunts along those lines. I would say like there was a stripper somewhere involved. There was a party that got shut down by San Francisco Police Department. How are you coming up with these ideas? What's your own pipeline for generating these viral ideas? I personally think I have quite strong viral sense. I spend a lot of time scrolling on Instagram, TikTok like right now almost as a mandatory keeping up with the the the pace of the culture. Um and you just need this viral sense and when you have it then it will like these things come.\n\nObvious, obvious to you. Um, about every single day, we have like a marketing brainstorming session where we'll just like, like unscheduled, we'll just spend an hour talking about what is the next crazy stunt that we can do. And because everyone here is an influencer with viral sense, they know what goes viral. Like everyone spreads out these crazy good ideas. And like, literally every day, we come up with 20 ideas that have the potential to get 100 million views each. And, um, it's, it's, it's sessions like this that you need. And it's sessions like this where like the whole, let's do a stripper commercial or let's do a, let's do a like, like partying and getting like, like that, that these brainstorming sessions are where that comes from. Comes from a group of high, a highly dense group of people with viral sense just brainstorming together.\n\nHow old are you guys? Is there anyone in the 30 plus range?\n\nOne person. Yes, one person. So, primarily younger people who really are understanding the heartbeat of these short-form videos. They get together. You guys are coming up with 20 ideas. And then take me through idea selection, filming, uploading.\n\nYeah. I mean, every day we're trying to figure out like, like, we're almost like, I, I, I would say what we're doing in these meetings is reverse-engineering the algorithm. We'll talk about what we've seen lately that's gone viral and then we'll try to dissect at, like, the core level, why did this go viral and what can we learn from it? Um, something that's really interesting that will come out in the near future is a Cluey anime. And, um, this will start with a trailer just to like tease the waters, but like, like this conversation started with, you know, like Chachoro Image and the whole Studio Ghibli trend took over, took over the internet by storm. We just kept on wondering like, why did this happen? And it wasn't super controversial, like what was the, what was the super viral component to this? And, and we think like among many things, it is that the people in tech are people who grew up watching anime and Studio Ghibli, and this is like such a nostalgic, deeply emotional, provocative feeling for them that, um, there's something to be gained from this. And then we just talk down what, what are things we could do. Eventually, we settled on, man, let's, it, let's make a Cluey anime. And that ends up being a viral, viral moment. And like, you can, like, keep this on record, this will do like over 100 million views. And I, I, I bet my life on this. Um, the Cluey anime, it will be like an extremely viral moment. And, uh, this is just one of many things that we have coming up.\n\nThere's like a huge bridge between identifying a good idea, like an anime, like even potentially I could do that, and then actually making it happen. So walk us through kind of your playbook of that. Obviously, it sounds like you're hiring people who are really good and have proven they've already gotten views. How are you like, kind of further enabling them to make sure that they can create this good content?\n\nUh, yeah, I mean, we at this point have an in-house UGC studio of over 60 creators who are on retainer, on schedule, and like, like that system is just running. Um, we have like an in-house influencer marketing reaching out, schedule, and that, that system is just running. We have an in-house, and we're, we're building out this in-house like entire film studio where we literally have videographers, editors working to make like movie-quality launch videos every week. And that, that's up and running. And if there's ever anything that like a content format that we don't know how to make, then we'll just like, we all have agency here. We'll, we'll just look up a studio that that can do it and then we'll just like, we, we'll find a way to make it happen. If you're convinced enough in the virality of a moment, then like how much effort would you put into a video that you know with certainty is going to 100 million views? A lot of effort, probably. So it's, it's really not that much overhead. And if it turns out that this is super repeatable, then we might just like try and do it in-house and we'll try and find an animated animator studio to to do this entirely in-house for us. But we're not there yet.\n\nSo, we talked a lot about your marketing. When I asked people what I should be talking to you about, everybody wanted to get deeper on the product. And let's start with that. I think that the coolest thing is your UX. I think it's actually a new paradigm for UX that I hadn't seen before. This started with your product before Cluey, Interview Coder, where you came up with liquid glass essentially before Apple. Talk us through your process of developing that UX.\n\nYeah, I mean, Interview Coder is sort of like the prototype of Cluey. And this started out as like, this was the beginning of everything for me. And it was a tool to let you cheat on technical interviews. And I spent about two months just like really trying to narrow down like, like, like what the is the most extreme, uh, UX that I can do. An interviewer that I'm in an interview with is not going to be able to know that I'm using AI. And like, I need AI to spit out an answer and I need to be able to write that answer myself. So like, like, like, like, bro, the, the obvious thing here is translucency. Um, you need to have code overlaid on top of your workflow and code that, that, that, that you can see below it. And this is, this is something new, like, like, like nobody's tapped into this. Um, like everybody has like a separate app app for AI or like a separate window and you need to split screen AI, but that's not what AI should feel like. I mean, that's that's not like the capability of AI is like transformative. And, and, and the, the true graphical interface of AI has to feel seamless and integrated into every single workflow. And that's what, that's what the translucency comes from. Um, and I think that's, that's like obviously where Apple is headed with Liquid Glass. They're like prepping us for a world where AI is everywhere. And, and, and the way it will be shown is this translucent overlay. Um, yeah.\n\nHow did you personally kind of design that? Cuz I think the design is amazing. Like, did you have a lot of iterations? Did you get it right pretty early on? How did you get there?\n\nYeah, there were probably like 20 to 30 versions of Interview Coder that we tried before we landed on this final version. And, um, this took like a lot of, uh, a lot of back to the whiteboard. But, I mean, this is like just ended up being the best, most seamless version that, that, that we came up with. Um, yeah, it was, it was literally just brute force. Brute force. What is the best product?\n\nAnd do you guys have a designer on staff?\n\nNo. No. No. The design, like, like the product design is just led by by us, like the founders.\n\nWe're all cracked engineers primarily. Is that how you're going to continue building the company?\n\nYeah. I mean, the, the, the thing about company building is when you're really good at one thing, the other things sort of come. If you have really, really good engineers, then the distribution will come. And if you have really, really good distribution, then good engineers and good product will come. Um, and this is sort of what we're seeing, like, like our inbound is like pretty massive. It's crazy. Like we have people from every company in the world. We have the best engineers who want to come, um, work with us just as a function of our distribution being so good. And this will in turn lead to our product being amazing. And that will in turn like, like funnel all the other things. And, um, generally company building is a positively reinforcing cycle of success. And when you have your first big win, this will just winners affect you into having more and more big wins. Um, and, yeah, like these engineers, they, they know what they're doing. They have great product sense and they, they, they, they help us iterate closer and closer to the end state of Cluey.\n\nHow are you guys prioritizing what those engineers work on together? Are you guys building a roadmap together on some sort of cadence, deciding sprints, or any of those things normal tech companies do?\n\nBro, it's like, I feel like, I feel like it's pretty obvious when you have so many users, like, like literally when we started Cluey, we just said, \"Let's build the most general version of Interview Coder, ma, launch it, make it massively viral, and then see what people are using it for, and then we can like iterate towards like the actual product that we want to build.\" And that's, that's like exactly what we've done. Like we've, we've, we've built Interview Coder for everything. And we've, we've given it like, like a very controversial marketing flare and called it cheat on everything. And now we have like literally millions of requests coming in a day that literally tell us how people are using Cluey. And we have like hundreds of customer emails saying like, hey, this is what I hate about Cluey. And like, like, okay, okay, like now I know what we need to fix. And now we know where the stickiest use cases are. Um, yeah, I'm not sure if that answered your question.\n\nI think the tough part is just like letting anyone do whatever they want, cuz there might be four people trying to solve the same problem differently and trying to ship, you know, conflicting ways to solve it. How are you kind of organizing your guys' work to make sure it's on the highest priority stuff?\n\nI think we're, I mean, the, the, the team is so lean, like we're so aligned, like, like we literally have four engineers right now. So I mean, just every product decision makes, yeah, it's just, just getting made by the team.\n\nYeah. And I think, I think it's, it's easy to, to forget, but we are really, really new, really early. Um, but we've just been on top of the timeline for so long. This is a function of my distribution strategy being correct that everyone thinks we've been around for forever. But in reality, like the first line of code was written 10 weeks ago. So it's, it's extremely new.\n\nSo the technical challenge I see you guys solving is how do we get kind of long context screen recordings plus audio transcripts that are two ways to a model to get like a pretty quick response. So what are the kind of innovations you guys have made on that front?\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, we have our own custom audio engine that that takes in system audio and microphone audio from the Mac. As far as we know, only Granola has has something like this. Um, even like OBS Studio doesn't have this implemented yet. Uh, that's that's one of the things that we have. Um, the other things we, we, we have like a pretty refined, me, like, like for, for, for understanding the context of your screen in particular, uh, the models are not intelligent enough yet for you to just pass in like an ever-recording screen recording of what's going on in your screen and have it expected to reason over that. Instead, we, we, we take a screenshot at the time of query and pass that in with the rest of the token. And we have a specific image decompressor to like, like the native Mac screenshot is like, is like, decompress is, is like, it's, it's, it's super HDPG. And, and we have like, we have like a specific image compression to to make that decrease the token size and, and sort of like decrease the input. And, and there's, there's, there's some things we do with with servers and some things we're playing around with right now for, um, decrease latency on the server request handling side. Like, there's a lot of variance with OpenAI. Like, sometimes you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll make a route when it's busy and it'll take five seconds, but when it's not busy, it'll take one second. And there's workarounds to this, which is like, host your own models on your own servers and you won't have to deal with that variance. Um, those, those are all things that we're exploring.\n\nAnd right now it sounds like you guys are mainly built on top of OpenAI.\n\nUh, yeah. Yeah. GPT 4.1 is is the main model provider right now.\n\nOkay. So it sounds like you guys are going to end up following a pretty similar playbook to like the Cursors and Lovables of the world, where you start to build in multiple different models for different use cases and start to eventually personalize these models for people.\n\nYeah, of course. Inevitably. Yeah.\n\nAnd when you look at that future, what is the, what is the type of investment you're going to be need to be making? Cuz I think like these model companies like Anthropic and OpenAI, they are like burning cash like billions of dollars. Is that the type of investment you foresee making?\n\nI don't think so. I think the application layer is just fundamentally different from the model layer. The race to AGI is competitive and lucrative enough that the, the model providers are busy building AGI. And in the meantime, there is like literally trillions of dollars of economic delta to be swept up by application layer companies. And that's exactly what we're doing. And as a result of us just being like application layer, we don't have to take upfront the costs of of of racing towards AGI and we can afford to just have traditional SaaS margins and is like the best place in the world to be right now.\n\nWhat's the most successful sort of upgrade you guys have shipped since the initial version of the product?\n\nYeah, I mean, we've been focusing a lot like, like we, we just signed a huge enterprise contract. So we've been focusing a lot on shipping features specifically for them, but pretty much every single enterprise feature, like post-call summaries, is is is is probably one of what one of the big ones. Every time you use Cluey in a meeting, you can end the meeting. It'll give you a summary of what happened in the meeting and it'll also tell you times you should have used Cluey when you didn't use Cluey. And this is like the ultimate training tool for sales reps. Like, like as a result, like you can, hey, customer had an X objection. You should have, you should have used Cluey to to answer why, but you didn't. And as a result, like you lost the deal, and this like literally spells out for you, here's why you lost the deal because you didn't use Cluey at X moment.\n\nYeah, I feel like the sales tech market is going to be huge for you guys. I was a VP of product at Apollo.io, if you know that company.\n\nOf course. Of course you know Apollo. Had CEO of ZoomInfo on the podcast. Like all of his growth recently has been through these AI tools for sales people. Do you envision kind of building like a Cluey for sales or are you going to continue to build it as kind of a product for everybody with maybe some specific sales features?\n\nI mean, yeah, like\n\nLike Chach for sales is just Chach, right? Um, that that's like it's like sort of what what we're angling for. Like there are enterprise really specific enterprises use cases that are highly, highly profitable, but at the end of the day, we don't want to just only capture the sales tech market. We want to be the default way that you use AI in the future. And as you've said, like the most interesting thing about Cluey is the UX. I think this UX is not just good for tech, technical interviews and sales people, like it's good for everybody. And if it is good for everybody, if there is potential market fit for everybody, then we might as well try and capture the biggest audience that we can. Do you think that all AI apps are going to have that kind of UX in the future? Almost inevitably, I think like chatbot is just, it's it's just wrong. The models will get better. Like literally, the model you use today is the worst, the model is the worst model you will ever use for the rest of your life. These models are inevitably going to improve. And when they do, they will be intelligent enough to take knowledge of your screen and be able to use it to give you to give you a better answer. Like, like it's just, it's just so obvious that chatbot is not the future. And like Karpathy is over there, like, like at startup school talking about, bro, like the new GUI for AI needs to be developed. It still hasn't been developed. Like, we, we, we, we need it. We were waiting for it. And Apple's coming out with Liquid Glass. It is obvious that this is the bet that every single reasonable, rational human being in the world is making. One of the most interesting things I saw recently on Twitter was people claimed your system prompt was leaked. I have that up on screen right now. Is this what was actually your system prompt? I mean, probably, like, like this, this gets changed like every three days, probably. Like, like the, the prompt is not the mode. We're going to open source this anyways. Um, the specific system prompt. I, I mean, like, like in the end state with the intelligent enough model, like the system prompt will be, here's the audio, here's the screen, help this user the way they need help. That will be the, the end state of the system prompt will be able to reason. Like, right now, we're just, uh, we're like adding in things to to to like, like, like try and make it better. But I mean, like, we're not selling at the system prompt here. We're selling Cluey and we're selling the specific user experience. Like, like this, this has nothing to do with the product. Okay, that's really interesting because I'm a bit of a prompt engineering nerd. So I wanted to geek out on this, but you're saying this is changing so fast and it's not really that important. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, um, we, we have like custom evals in house and we're using them to like, like iterate towards a a better prompt, but at the same time, like even our use cases, the main use cases for Cluey change every day. So I mean, like, like the, the, the system prompt also changes every day. Like this is by no means like perfected or analyzed or or iterated on at all. This is just, um, like something we just came up with that seems to fit the evals and metrics of usage that we see today. One of the things I noticed experimenting with the product myself was that you have this personalized component and I think that that really unlocks a lot of the value in Cluey. Are you encouraging people to use that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're playing around with the new onboarding right now. Um, like, like that will show them personalized. Cuz in reality, the, the general AI assistant, the tech is not there, but the tech for, hey, you are a sales assistant and you, your express purpose is to help me make the sale here, common objections, here's product knowledge, like that works really well. And even more so, like, hey, I am Aakash Gupta, I run this newsletter and XYZ, and and I want you to respond in XYZ way, like that works really well. And again, like, like the thing we're selling here is the, the UX. So I mean, we're, we're, we're playing around with the new onboarding to get people really used to the personalized. But yeah, you're right, that is the, the value of right now. Yeah. As a former head of product growth at a SAS company, that's what I jumped to. It's like the onboarding and then the information architecture just to make sure that like if people are using it regularly and they're a paying seat and they haven't personalized to keep sending them back to like personalize or maybe even like you said, kind of getting the model to update its personalization on its own. Yeah. Yeah. Those are both things we're pretty interested in. Um, that that that will be default. What we're really hesitant to do is push out a feature that will get solved by a smarter model. And that that that's that's why we're really hesitant about the personalized because in reality, if there was a smarter model, you wouldn't need to like push people to personalize. You could just have a smarter model just reason. Um, but, but, but we're not there yet and we're, we're, we're still debating internally on what to do with that. So if you're building cheating software for everything, how does a product manager cheat with Cluey? Uh, yeah, I mean, there's like imagine you're on a customer call with someone and you're trying to sell them your enterprise product. Uh, like there, there, there's many way, like you're on a, you're on a call with a new person. You just back-to-back meetings. You know nothing about this person. With Cluey, you can just like command enter, who is this guy? And it will just immediately tell you or surface the information. And every single time they say something that you don't know. Um, like for example, hey, I spent the last eight years at Adobe Force and you have no idea what that is. All of a sudden you can just command enter, enter, and now you know exactly what Adobe Force is. And it's like, oh yeah, yeah, Adobe. Like, like you know everything about this person. You're now the default expert in, um, anything they talk about. And this is like, this is what cheating looks like on meetings. You all of a sudden have access to this breath of information that you never had access to before thanks to AI. And the other person has no idea. This is cheating. Um, and, and this, this is, this is as you can imagine, like every single enterprise call or even just like a regular call in general. How many times you say I don't know or how many times you say, hey, I, I forgot that last question. Like, like every single instance of this is solved when you have this AI that's listening and can surface relevant context. AI evals are one of the most important skills for PMs and I know you know they matter. The question is, are you doing them right? Most teams are winging it with basic metrics and hoping for the best. Meanwhile, the teams that actually ship reliable AI, they've cracked the code on systematic evaluation. Today's episode is brought to you by the AI Evals for Engineers and PMs course by HML Hussein and Shreya Shunker. This live Maven course will teach you the battle-tested frameworks from HML and Treya, who are the engineers behind GitHub Copilot's evaluation system and 25 plus production AI implementations. Four weeks live instruction. Next cohort starts July 21st. Start shipping AI that actually works. Enroll at Maven.com with my code ag-product-growth for over $800 off. That's A-G-P-R-O-D-U-C-T-G-R-O-W-T-H. There's this rumor online that you raised your $15 million Series A in two days. Is that true? Uh, it was a preempt. I mean, we didn't even do a proper fundraise. Like they just kind of came to the office as soon as we got to San Francisco. Uh, they saw what we were doing, they liked it, and they just immediately just offered a term sheet pretty much. Um, yeah, like, like two days is just a ju just something we said, but in reality, it took like zero days because you didn't do a fundraise at all. Crazy. So that was basically the power then of your distribution and A16Z wanting to make a bet on you guys. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's pretty clear that that we spike really, really hard. And I think if you're wanting like gigantic fund returners, then you don't bet on the guys doing the same thing everyone else is doing. Um, it's, it's very clear that we have a world-class distribution and marketing team. So, um, yeah. So you're already making more from enterprise than consumer, and you want to reach $100 million ARR within the year. What's your forecast of how that revenue split will look like? Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm hoping that at our end state, it looks like 30% enterprise, 70% consumer. Um, and I think that's just, uh, like we have a strong consumer product and and something like this is is PLG to the moon. Um, and, and I'm, I think there's like a very strong consumer use case and obviously we have the best, probably the best consumer marketing team in the world right now. Um, yeah, but, but like there's more enterprise inbound than we can handle at the moment and, uh, yeah, like pretty interested in exploring that as well. The tough thing about consumers, they churn so badly versus enterprise, you know, they just stick around forever. Yep. What's your vision for Cluey even beyond $100 million? Yeah, I mean, we really think that we've got, we've like been first to move on the UX of the future. Um, and I think everybody is just like confirming that we are correct about translucent overlay being the future. And, um, right now, it's just a land grab for us. The enterprise end state, I mean, this is a tool that will be able to pull from your CRM, use that knowledge to assist you real time and then push back to your CRM. The end state for enterprise, like we literally kill Salesforce and we become the new CRM of the future. It's AI native. It's real time and it takes in all the context of all enterprise knowledge and feeds it to you directly. That is the enterprise end state. And the consumer end state is true, like, like I've been on record saying this a few times, but like brain chips, that is the ultimate form factor for AI. When we have AGI and super intelligence, we do not want to be like humans versus AGI, we want to be like humans plus AGI. And that means brain chips. And, um, that is, I truly think that is the end state of the company of Cluey. Right now, we're distributing and we're going hyperviral. Distributing the future form factor for AI. And if we're going to double down and project this out for a few years or a few decades, this means that we're going to stay hyperviral. We're going to distribute the brain chips. You, Alexander Wang, Elon, you guys all seem to be on this brain interface pathway. What are the rest of us missing on this? I mean, I feel like it's just inevitable. Like tech is exponentiating right now. If you just look at the number of like the amount of software by lines of code being written is literally hockey sticking right now thanks to AI. Every single technological innovation is going to come faster. Research is going to be significantly developed. I mean, like if technology, tech, technology exponentiates, then the border and the line between sci-fi and reality just like change, changes like, like, like immediately in that case. Like, like what, what, what is the most optimistic way you can see ASI, AGI? Like, like I, I truly think it's brain chips. Like, like if it's not integrated into our brains, then it will not help us in the best way that that it can. I am a true AI maximalist to my heart. That's why I say cheat on everything. In reality, that means use AI for everything in every instance possible. And if I really believe what I say, then like that means like brain chips. You said me verse Elon verse Sam, we're all going to be competing for titles as conquerors of the universe. Walk me through how we get to you competing with OpenAI and XAI. Yeah, I mean, it feels quite clear to me that companies are converging into super companies. And the ways that you can get there are either be a massive company already or just like moonshot yourself into massive, massive size. And that means flipping a coin and landing heads 20 times in a row. And that means you just have to swing the biggest way you possibly can. Make the most, most noise you possibly can and just hope that that the things that you spike in will just funnel you more and more and more into greatness. I think there are a few short years before the super companies will have emerged and it will have been decided who the winners are. And in that few short years, I have the time to do what I do best and that is make as much noise as possible and attract the attention of the whole world onto a product that will only get better. Um, and, and, and I, I truly think that if there is a reasonable case for us to be a super company, this is the case. We are capable of commanding more attention than anybody else at our scale with our budget. And we've, we've shown this not once this past few days, but like the past few months, I've shown that I've been able to command the attention of the entire X timeline. Um, and I think this only projects out into ultimate scale. We get more money, we get more funding with our knowledge of the algorithms, like we will just dominate the mind, capture entire extreme consumer mind share, and this will projectile moonshot us into hyper relevance and and super company status. So the critical thing there, I think, is then building that company right within Cluey. So let's talk about working at Cluey. You said you're not going to have any work-life balance if you work at Cluey. Your whole life is Cluey. So what is the type of culture you're trying to build? Yeah, I mean, this literally looks like a frat frat house, exemplified. We have a six-bedroom mansion in San Francisco. Three stories and pretty much everyone lives here or you live a block away. You spend all your time here. You dig around here. Where we give free Hinge Premium to all our employees and every single date is sponsored. We spend our time about about future and like our careers, our relationships. It's it's a friend group with the sole purpose of living like, like a tribe almost. The frat house mentality, it works pretty well to grow at the beginning. Do you think there are any risks? I'm sure that there's things that we're doing that like, like we'll end up in lawsuits later, but I mean, you solve problems when they come, not before they come. Maybe that maybe this will burn me, but I mean, like right now, this, this is what the culture of the com of of a company should feel like. If you're clocking out at 7:00 p.m., going home and just like, you know like\n\nHanging out in your second life, then I feel like you're just not invested in the company. Your work, your life, everything about you should be clearly. That's a really high bar. Usually you have to pay people a lot. What's your approach to compensation to getting people to buy into this culture? Yeah, I mean, we do pay people a lot. Like, I think it's ridiculous to me that companies are seemingly having a race to the bottom to see what's the lowest amount I can pay my software engineers while still having them like dedicated. If you want employees that are dedicated to you, you should be dedicated to your employees. And this means that paying them what they're worth. Every software engineer we have is bringing us upwards of like a few hundred thousand of revenue per year by headcount. So by that metric alone, they should be getting paid that much. Um, and I think I'm not hesitant to pay employees massive salaries and give them massive equity because they're vital. Like, if I expect you to be a part of the cult religion of Cloy, then I should be rewarding you as if you are a valid contributing member of the cult and everything we do is like extreme. Um, our compensation ranges are extreme, the company outings are extreme, the hinge premium is extreme. Like, everything we do is extreme and as a result, it's a super unique culture. And the thing is, you don't apply if you're not interested in the culture. Like, right now, what we're doing, I mean, it's interesting to almost everybody in the world. The parallels it gives me most to are Uber, right? And Uber was able to take that culture. Travis was able to get everybody to invest all in. And I think the lawsuits came down the line from, you know, women were at the workplace finding it too fatty and things like that. How do you kind of protect yourself from those downsides? I mean, it's not like we're like sexually harassing or assaulting people in here. Like, we're just like digging around and, um, like, I don't think this is a pretty friendly work environment for anyone who's like of the age of, like, I don't know if I'm allowed to say that, but I mean, if you're like a chill, youthful, fun guy, you will come here and you'll, or a guy or girl, you'll come here and you'll have a good time. And I don't think that means like sexually harassing your employees or anything. Okay. And you said you wanted to launch the best paid internship program. You said you wanted to launch and hire 50 interns. Is that how it's turned out? We have more than 50 interns if you count UGC content creators as interns. And I think that there's a very strong case for YouTube. I mean, like, what is a marketing internship? You're working part-time for a company in the hopes of a full-time return offer and you're providing value for them by getting more eyeballs in the company. That is what a marketing internship is. And right now in today's world, in today's like economy, like what that looks like for us is you sit in front of a camera and you make videos and you get paid for the videos that you make. By all means, like our UGC creators are grow. They're marketing interns. They're better marketing interns than like every other company hires. Like, I guarantee you this is more profitable and lucrative than having some 17-year-old college kid try and design a billboard or whatever the other marketing interns are doing at bigger companies. And if you count them as interns, then yeah, we're like over 70 then. Okay. So, I really like that. So, you're using your internship program to find your UGC creators. These are generating your hundreds of millions of views on Instagram and TikTok. Yeah. Yeah. So, I told my dad, a 60-some professor of computer science that I was interviewing you this weekend, and he said, \"You have to ask Roy, are we all going to get dumber?\" Because his students are using these cheating tools, and he feels like they're not. I mean, like, what exactly are they learning? Like, I bet the blacksmithing instructor from 1600s would have thought like, \"Man, it's a shame that all these students, these people nowadays, they don't know anything about blacksmithing. Like, why exactly do we need to know blacksmithing?\" Like, as technology advances, there's bits of knowledge that we don't need to know and bits of knowledge that become exponentially more relevant. And I think with AI, this is going to massively change the scale of how things work. It's going to make 99% of knowledge in the world redundant right now. And the 1% of knowledge that is left, it will be 100 times more useful to know. So no, I don't think people are getting dumber. Like, maybe people are memorizing facts less. Like, maybe there will be less people who know what the 50 capital states of America are. But I'm like, okay. So it kind of goes back to that LeetCode example then, right, of interview coder where it's like the stuff we're not learning, like how to memorize the answer to 600 algorithms riddles, isn't maybe that important in the future work labor? The human experience will look so different. There's not one historian that is going to look back and think, man, it would be better if we knew this useless information. In fact, has that ever happened in history? Like, I would argue that it hasn't where technology has evolved and made some X form of knowledge useless and people are saying, like, man, the world would be so much better if that technology never existed and people would know more about this Y random subject that has never happened in the history of humanity ever. When the calculator emerged, people were people definitely are worse at computing fast right now than they were when before the calculator arrived. Not a single soul says that the calculator was like an evil invention. Like, everyone agrees that it was just better for the progress of humanity despite it resulting in people being worse at computing things like mentally. And that's just a skill that is irrelevant. And right now, like literally these models are the worst they will ever be for the rest of your life. If a model can do it right now, why would you think that it could not do it in the future? And if it can't do it right now, then whatever task that is is obsolete. On the betting market, Polymarket, there's a bet that you're going to go to jail this year. Why would you go to jail? I don't think I will go to jail. I don't think I'm doing anything illegal here. I think the company is growing. It's flourishing. The employees are happy. I'm happy. And there's no reason for me to go to jail. I think people take what I'm doing, which is applying the markets, applying the principles of like engagement bait and rage bait from Instagram, TikTok, applying it to X, LinkedIn, and seeing massive success with it, and they're extrapolating it to a character or persona or traits that don't actually exist in real life. All I'm doing is very good marketing because I'm able to skill set from a wealth of experiences that most people, most tech bros, just never had. Insanely good viral sense, I think. Thank you. What's something people get wrong? Most people get wrong about Cloy. I think they think that there is no product, but I think one thing that people forget often is that the company is just the first line of code was written 10 weeks ago. This is more new than the recent batch of YC startups, but it is just so dominantly on your timeline. People think this company has been around forever. When are they going to ship a product? And you just can't get it off. It's so on top of your mind. But in reality, like, we are extremely new. Um, and people say like, this is like I could have built this in a weekend as like a hackathon project. Like, we did. It has been built over essentially a weekend. It is essentially a hackathon project that is getting iterated on like extremely quickly. I think that's the one thing that people get wrong. They forget because of how dominant we've been on the timeline. They forget how new the company really is. Well, I'm looking forward to the ongoing future versions of Cloy. I'm hoping that next year's Cloy looks nothing like this one. Roy, thanks for being on the podcast. Yeah, thanks for having me, man. Appreciate you, brother.
