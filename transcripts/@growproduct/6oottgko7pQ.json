  "cleanText": "Of tasks that are high leverage for a PM, product discovery is number one.\nAnd AI is allowing PMs to do much better and more product discovery.\nToday, I sit down with Tanguy Crusson, who is one of the preeminent thinkers on product discovery as head of product for Jira Product Discovery for the last 5 years.\nAnd today's episode will blow your mind on a new way of working.\nCan you walk us through step by step an Ideal Discovery Process?\nUh yeah, so ideal, uh no, uh but an example, definitely.\nUh and what I'll use is the example for how we do things in the Jira Product Discovery team.\nSo the uh quote unquote process that we follow ourselves has four main, I'd call them stages.\nIt looks like waterfall.\nIt's not really waterfall.\nThings keep moving from one stage to the other based on what we learn.\nBut generally speaking, whenever we tackle a new problem area, that's what we follow.\nWhen we created Jira Product Discovery, the product, the whole product, we followed stages in this process as well.\nSo it applies for us at the macro level, and it applies also at the micro level when we work on specific features.\nThe reason we created this process was that it's very complicated to talk about the stages of things with everyone at Atlassian.\nUh so whenever we talk about an idea, and this idea is it's super fuzzy, we don't, we're not even sure what problem area we're doing, we need to give it a name because people might assume it's further down the track otherwise, and maybe we'll come to them with a specific ask to help depending on the stage.\nSo for example, if we are making something, we might come with an ask from a dependencies to help us build something, versus if we're exploring solutions, uh and we're just about to exit that stage, it means that we might be asking for funding or things like that and things like that, right?\nSo, we've kind of set those four uh stages as vocabulary across the whole of Atlassian.\nPretty much everyone knows at Atlassian what we're doing when we say we've got something in Wonder.\nSo, we've got wonder, explore, make, and impact.\nWonder is all about problem exploration.\nWe're not exactly sure what we're doing, but we've got a lot of customers currently that are talking about in their road mapping process how they should be working with dependencies and working with capacity, and those things seem to be tied together, for example.\nAnd so what we do is we get and do uh about a dozen user interviews and to try and unpack that and to go with customers and try, try to understand how these things fit together.\nAnd the conversations would usually be about an hour long.\nAnd we do a few of them until we feel like, okay, the same themes are coming back and so on and so forth.\nOnce we've got a good uh understanding uh of that, we go into solution explorations.\nAnd our goal here is not just to go into a, you know, a room, create designs, and then only come out when the designs are finished.\nNo, the goal is basically to quickly find ways to test stuff with users until they tell us, \"Yes, this would actually solve my problem.\"\nI have a few examples of that.\nThen once we have enough validation that something is worth investing into, that's when a team makes a pitch to go into make, which is okay, you know what?\nWe've got all the validation that we need here.\nIt's enough now.\nWe should really start working with a lot more customers.\nSo, currently we've got 10 that are interested, would like to get to 100 and progressively to a thousand, for example.\nAnd so that's what we call make, which is we're committing to building something.\nWe've got enough validation waiting for it.\nAnd now it's really about making it happen.\nMaybe we just do a first version first.\nMaybe we do some more iterations later.\nSo we try to shape that there.\nAnd there's a few iterations that that go in make.\nAnd then impact is usually when uh okay, the problem has translated into something that is in the product, and now we're measuring to see how well it performs.\nUh because it might be working well for a small number of users, but we need to make it work well with a super large number of users.\nAnd so we call that impact.\nThere's usually a few months after we launch things, we do a, we sit down and we write down an impact page to go, this is actually how it's performing.\nWe recommend just putting it on hold for now.\nIt's doing fine or doing one more iteration or we actually need to have a road map over a longer period of time to actually have it work to its full potential.\nWhat should we do?\nShould we retire it?\nShould we leave it to a small number of customers or should we invest more?\nSo that's the process: problem, solution, building it for real, and actually iterating on it until we've got the, we, we hit the desired goals for it.\nSo um, probably best that I go into, so that's Jira Discovery, and that's our Jira Product Discovery project.\nSo in there, we do everything from discussing uh feedback that we receive from customers, uh classifying them into okay, those are big bets uh versus iterations on current experiences versus like small pebbles, which are tiny uh UX improvements that uh any engineer can come in and pick up uh whenever they've got some spare spare time and want to do something different.\nAnd it's also where we have our road map.\nSo going from the road map that we have at the highest level uh and that we share with our leadership focused on bets and solutions and then road maps from uh specific teams, for example, that would go more into solutions uh that ladder up to specific bets and specific iterations, right?\nSo there's um uh what we do in the job of the discovery team is we uh actually are on rot rotation, the PM team to look at user feedback uh so we're uh four PMs, meaning every week there's one of us four that for the week looks at all the feedback and tags this feedback based on what we learn to as insights to ideas.\nWe discuss that every week all together.\nI think next week is actually my turn.\nUh and uh then uh we sit down uh more or less every month to discuss, okay, so what's changed really that means that we should revise, review our road maps.\nSo let's assume that we have said, okay, you know what, that stuff came often enough, we need to look into it.\nUh what we do is we start a wonder stage, which is let's look at, let's, let's unpack the problem.\nSo I've got here um in product management, jobs to be done, which is one of our bets.\nWe help product operations teams and administration teams roll out JPD job with the discovery at scale, and it's part of the jobs to be done theme where we focus on specific personas, uh PMs, product operations, administration.\nSo in there, there's something called global fields.\nIt was not called global fields before.\nIt was a messy area uh which was called global entities, which was we were finding people kept talking to us about having many JPD discovery spaces, projects, and needing to be able to work with all of them uh at scale, and it was um initially the, we had, we had discussed a bunch of solutions and we were like, you know what, it's super easy, and one of the uh product managers in in product discovery, why don't you go actually figure out what what that all means?\nAnd she went, run a wonder stage, and this is a typical outcome from a wonder stage, which is a page that tries to find um basically who we're trying to help and the types of problems that they face.\nSo she had decided for this particular exploration to focus on specific persona.\nSo product ops, program management, VPs, stakeholders, and PMs.\nAnd then what we do for all of them, what I ask the PMs is, all right, I don't care about big lengthy pages that explain to me how big a problem is.\nInstead, give me all up less than 10 minutes of videos of customers talking about their problems, and I want to see the different facets of it, right?\nRight?\nSo it has to be probably at least 10 customers and they have to be talking about their problems in ways that makes us understand the different facets of these problems.\nAnd so that's what Amos does really, really well.\nShe starts and runs a little bit of uh research.\nIt lasts for a couple of weeks, and she comes back with a page like this where you see there's one uh problem area here, there's a second problem area here, and there's a third one there.\nUh and then uh that's it.\nAnd literally we have a meeting with all the product managers and we watch this together, silent reading and watching videos for 10 minutes, and then we discuss, and usually within half an hour after that, we're like, oh yeah, yeah, that sounds important or it needs a bit more uh exploration and whatnot, but that's really for us what wonder means.\nIt doesn't have to be something which is uh like we've surveyed uh thousands of users.\nWe've done this comprehensive uh super scientific approach to all this.\nIt's really no, like we've got a few customers that have been voicing this.\nLet's go in there and understand how they're feeling that pain, and we bring that to the rest of the team so they understand where the pain comes from.\nSo that's for us, that for us is wonder.\nUh any, any questions you'd have before we're going to explore?\nToday's episode is brought to you by Jira Product Discovery.\nIf you're like most product managers, you're probably in Jira, tracking tickets and managing the backlog.\nBut what about everything that happens before delivery?\nJira Product Discovery helps you move your discovery, prioritization, and even road mapping work out of spreadsheets and into a purpose-built tool designed for product teams.\nCapture insights, prioritize what matters, and create road maps you can easily tailor for any audience.\nAnd because it's built to work with Jira, everything stays connected from idea to delivery.\nUsed by product teams at Canva, Deliveroo, and even The Economist.\nCheck out why and try it for free today at aten.com/roduct-discovery.\nThat's atlasia.com/roduct-discovery.\nJurroduct discovery.\nBuild the right thing.\nToday's episode is brought to you by the AIPM certification on Maven, run by McDad Jaffer, who is a product leader at OpenAI.\nThis is not your typical course.\nIt's 8 weeks of live cohort-based learning with the leader at one of the top companies in tech.\nOpenAI just doesn't stop shipping, and this is your chance to learn how.\nRun along with Product Faculty and Mo Ali.\nThe course has a 4.9 rating with 133 reviews.\nFormer students come from companies like OpenAI, Shopify, Stripe, Google, and Meta.\nThe best part, your company can probably cover the cost.\nSo, if you want to get $500 off, use my code a a kh25 and head to maven.com/rouct-faculty.\nThat's mavn.com/pect-fac.\nIt seems a lot like ethnographic research where instead of just doing a large survey, you're trying to go really deep and add texture to the problem, really understand how does that affect their jobs to be done.\nYeah, that's correct.\nAnd we try to uh we try to do as much as we can in uh plain English, raw emotions for those users.\nIt's like, okay, so you know, let's explain it to the team in the customer's own words how the pain is coming out, removing all the varnish there is around it.\nLet's try not to make it sound too smart.\nLet's try not to make it um so compelling with a lot of uh superlative and adjectives to describe it.\nInstead, let's just hear it from them.\nAnd what we found is people resonate a lot with that.\nThey'll be convinced in an abstract sense by reading a page that's beautifully written and they be like, \"Wow, that's smart.\"\nBut it doesn't trigger the urgency and the need for action that watching a video from a customer does.\nAnd it, it's even better when we invite, for example, engineers with us on some of these conversations, and the engineers hear it firsthand from the customers.\nThe response from them is like, okay, there's an innovation in innovation week next week.\nUh I'm going to try the solution for that, and they really go all in, and that's exactly the energy that we want around these problems.\nRight.\nBut that you guys tips for how to conduct this conversation as a PM.\nYeah.\nHonestly, if there's one investment you could make that would change your life as a PM is find a real user researcher, someone who does that as a trade and ask them for training.\nI used to think I was amazing at user interviews.\nI was saying a lot of smart things and people would concur with a lot of them.\nAnd then I had um a research Georgie Botmley, uh she was at Atlassian, and she watched about 20 user interviews and she said, \"Yeah, you, I know you're very proud of those 50 user interviews you did.\nDude, I can tell you you didn't learn a thing.\nYou're leading all these conversations.\nYou're pushing users to in directions that they would not have taken on their own.\nSo you're not really learning anything.\"\nAnd what she did is to basically give me a simple interview script with a lot of silence to follow, which is basically just, you know, ask them to introduce themselves, ask them to describe what they do in their company, and from then on, you don't have an interview script, you rebound on what they say, and you might be poke in one direction if they are going there, but you do not ask leading questions to take them somewhere.\nAnd so if you're trying to validate if product managers struggle with dealing with feedback, you don't never bring the word feedback in the conversation.\nInstead, you let them, you, you try to see if they go there, and if they go there, then you can start to poke.\nAnd the other feedback she gave me is never interrupt a user who's talking.\nSo some now after like I took all her feedback on board and started doing more interviews and she's like, \"Wow, I'm proud of you.\nThree minutes you didn't say a thing.\"\nUh and there's a few other tips like this, like never give options.\nYou know, it might be uncomfortable, but if someone, if you ask someone, uh for example, what's the first thing that you do in the morning?\nWe're humans.\nWe're trying to make the other person feel comfortable.\nWe're going to give options.\nWhat's the first thing you do in the morning?\nDo you drink coffee?\nDo you have a shower?\nDo you brush your teeth?\nOr when you try to interview users and you're trying to learn from them, the way you'd ask that is, \"What's the first thing that you do in the morning?\"\nand you just sit on your hands and you just wait, and there's an uncomfortable silence, and it's just there with you.\nYou feel like it's forever, and then they start talking, but the way they start talking is based on, it's, it's from their perspective.\nYou didn't give them options they can just latch on to and and reply yes to because they just want to please you by\n\n\nSo things like this are just tips and tricks.\nI'm not trying to tell you that's exactly what would work for you.\nMore like get training from a researcher.\nIt will drastically change everything that you do afterwards.\nOtherwise, I can promise you that you are going to have many conversations, and it's going to prove what you think is right.\nAnd this document seems really well written.\nWhat is the right way to sit down and put a document like this together?\n\nUm, I think mostly like the way Amos does it is the text doesn't matter.\nThe only thing that matters is the videos.\nI barely glance at the text.\nUm, I watch the videos, and what she's doing is to find ways to tell a story by selecting snippets of uh in the video that progressively ladder up to give me the feeling that I've looked at this via all the different facets.\nShe's got basically 10 minutes to summarize probably about 10 to 15 hours of conversations.\n\nAnd so typically what happens is it's a lot on it's a lot of the work that you do interviewing users and immediately after those conversations like finding the highlights that you think like really took you to an aha moment.\nSo I wouldn't focus so much time in the writing of the document but a lot more time in um making sure that as you go through the customer conversations you tag the moments that gave you this aha moment to see if you can reproduce that with the people you're going to share the video with.\nRight?\nAnd making sure that it it tells a story when you put all of them together is quite important.\nSo you basically are taking people with you.\nBy the end of reading this document, I was telling Amos, oh okay, I see you would like to build this, and she was like, yes, but I was I was it was so clear by watching this video, and it might be a trick to convince me, but she was convinced, right, uh that it was the right thing to do after doing all these interviews.\nSo that's why like it's a it should be a no-brainer to the people watching this.\nIt should be really clear.\nThere's a moment in when you start those conversations where you just don't know.\nThere's a it can last for a long time.\nYou're navigating, and you feel like you're going backwards some days.\nLike some things you were thinking some customers went that way, some customers went completely another way.\nThat's completely normal.\nAnd my advice here for people is just embrace that messiness.\nIt's fine.\nThat's actually those things that you know if you if you let it sit for a while eventually you're going to see through.\nIt's like if you take a bottle of water and you put sand in it and you shake everything.\nThat's what we do when we do a lot of user interviews.\nAnd then you you put it on the table and you you wait, and eventually the sand will settle, and you're going to see through.\nIt's exactly the type of of things that I asked the PM like wait till you you you've hit that clarity like you have another conversation and you're like oh I feel like I'm having the same conversation again, good, that's the moment where you actually write this page.\nIt should not take you more than two, three hours all up to write that page basically because you're already clear.\nSo you stop the interviews once you're converging on insights once that sand is starting to settle, and I think one thing that might get in people's way is just the tools itself because they'll say, \"I've never clipped a video and put a video together, several clips together.\nHow do you guys do that?\"\nOh, it's it's really simple these days.\nI don't know how many tools there is out there.\nUh for us, uh we've tried many.\nUh we use uh Loom for putting them together, and we also use Dovetail.\nUh so Dovetail is where a lot of our uh most of our user interviews go, and then it creates a transcript, and then we can query it for you know we can query transcript for specific themes, but also we can create snippets, and then we put them in in a in um in what's I think they call that an insight uh which would have a bunch of video reels put one after the other like the there's one.\nOkay, my advice to every PM as well is to like when you join a team and there's no, people don't talk to customers a lot, and they don't know how to do stuff like that.\nYour first job is to put that in place, right?\nSo, the finding like recruiting, identifying, recruiting, um setting time with customers, um extracting like running the interviews, extracting video clips from it should be something that takes you no thinking whatsoever.\nUh so for us for example I go in Pendo, I run a little segment, I know which customer I'd like to talk to for specific behaviors if it's data related about a specific feature, if not I will go into Dovetail or I would go into our Jira service management cube where I receive raw feedback, I'd run a little query, and I like within a few minutes I have I've got a few names of people I can talk to.\nI also have tooling to be able to send them u emails with a quick intro that's as little fluff as possible.\nHey, you've been using Jira Product Discovery a lot lately.\nI'm part of the team.\nWould love to chat about uh how we can make it better for you.\nThat kind of stuff.\nMake it human.\nSimple twoliners tops with a Calendly link.\nUh they click on it, they book time.\nIt's connected with my calendar.\nI don't have to send three options.\nThey reply.\nWe reply.\nNow, that stuff is gone.\nThen whenever I join this meeting, uh the the like I know that it's going to go to Dovetail.\nI've got my uh recorder uh uh coming with me on the call as well, so I know it's all going to be recorded so I can extract snippets after the call.\nUm like all that stuff, all that mechanics is really something that you should put in place because as a PM, AI or no AI, you're going to beat every other competitor if you learn faster than them and if you know more about your customers.\n\nAnd it's it's it's worth a lot like 10 times more than any automatic insights you can get from any uh model today which and so use the AI to get you in the right conversations is the way I would say it.\nUse the AI to extract snippets from videos.\nWatch as many of them as you can.\nSo for example, sometimes I go Gong and say I mentioned Jira Product Discovery say premium because we just launched it, and I see where it's mentioned, and boom I watch all the video clips.\nThat kind of stuff, right?\nThat's a lot that that's what will give you an unfair advantage because you're you're going to keep learning, and it's going to keep giving you perspectives that you didn't have.\n\nSo that's um uh that tooling really important.\nAnd so for us, we've got uh Dovetail here.\nWe've got a community group where users can come in, and they can ask questions.\nWe receive maybe 10 questions a day here sometimes.\nUm, and they ask questions like it can be as simple as uh something like this where uh like someone was saying, \"Oh, there's a bug.\nI used to be able to filter on this and I can't,\" and uh just took an example for the it happened yesterday, and uh today I was like, oh yes, we're looking into it.\"\nAnd then few hours later, okay, we fixed it for you.\nThat kind of stuff gets users engaged, and then they come back, they ask more questions so that we can then let them know when uh for example we're experimenting with new features.\nSo I for example posted this feature which is now part of the discovery premium plan, but basically it started just with the Loom where I was like hey we're thinking of this.\nWhat do you think?\nAnd so, uh, you can see here there was like 2,000 views on it.\nLots of, uh, um, comments and reactions, uh, and even at the bottom of the post, like either excitement or questions.\nI've got four pages of, of comments for it.\nWow.\nRight.\nUm, da da da.\nSo, we use it for that, for answering people's questions, for um, addressing their bugs.\nSo, it's quite useful at the scale that we're at, which is 18,000 customers today.\nWe still are able to stay on top of that, you know, with a PM team of four with a weekly rotation.\nUm, we do have Pendo where we basically uh can in-app ask questions to users.\nUh, we use that for seesat, but we also use that for things like we're looking at option A versus B.\nWhat do you think?\nUh, and sometimes it can help settle an argument.\nWe get like, I don't know, 100 answers, and we're like, see, and we look at that, but we often look at the commentary.\nWe always ask them like tell us more, and they give us commentary.\nSo whenever we hesitate between two things we just ask, and then we get something back that's pretty useful needs that need to implement this tooling, but once you have it it's really amazing.\nUh we do uh we do talk with customers on Slack.\nSo I've got uh probably about 20 customers uh that I'm I have on speed dial.\nSo they're all in this folder right here which is collapsed.\nAnd Medybank is one example.\nYou can see here 5th of May it's like what two weeks ago they had an issue using Jodo discovery with Miro with a new feature we built.\nWe helped them with that, and since then there's been other questions answers questions answers and then stuff that we has asked them to do as well sometimes.\nSo basically as close to the ground as possible is what I I would uh recommend for uh for things like this.\nRight.\nSo, and we've got this uh this thing where so you arrange your product discovery, and you might have feedback for us.\nYou click that, you just give us your feedback.\nThis feedback goes into Aura service management queue, and we can triage all this, and we tag the new things that we haven't thought about to ideas as insights, and we can also use robo here to give us like okay so in the last six months what do people say?\nUh which is a way to use the AI to help us like look at things at the macro level sometimes.\n\nAnytime I start in the new team that's the first thing we set up which is all these touch points to make it so customers just literally have to pick up the phone and they can talk to us.\nEvery PM that first joins the team say it's never going to scale, and I'm like I don't care because it's we're meant to be swamped with this stuff that's what will make us think, not if we're comfortable and we have little summaries that our research team gives us and it's all very well organized and there's we should do just one just A and B and C.\nIt doesn't work like that.\nWhat we know is we ship products, there's existing features, but they also want new things, and there's also reliability things we need to worry about.\nAnd there's some customer segments, it works for them, some it doesn't.\nSome would care about specific details, others just don't care.\nAnd it's just like this diversity, and this is is how I progressively get an understanding of what our users need.\nThe reason I I can say I think I've got some credibility in talking about this is as we scaled from 0 to 18,000 customers, our seat has stayed at above 85 the whole way.\nWow.\nAnd that's that's really hard to reach a score like this.\nIt's the first time in my career I actually get that.\nAnd that's where a lot of our growth comes from, too.\nTrust isn't just earned, it's demanded.\nWhether you're a startup founder navigating your first audit or a seasoned professional scaling your GRC program, proving your commitment to security has never been more critical or more complex.\nThat's where Vanta comes in.\nBusinesses use Vanta to establish trust by automating compliance needs across over 35 frameworks like SOCK 2 and

right?\nMost teams are winging it with basic metrics and hoping for the best.\nMeanwhile, the teams that actually ship reliable AI, they've cracked the code on systematic evaluation.\nToday's episode is brought to you by the AI Evals for engineers and PMs course by Hammel Hussein and Shrea Shunker.\nThis live Maven course will teach you the battle tested frameworks from HML and Shrea who are the

listening.\nBut I cannot vouch for this more.\nIt's about seeping the customer knowledge into your own LLM brain, right?\nAnd this is how you do it.\nYou're getting as close to the feedback as possible.\nYeah.\nAnd always try to frame it from the lens of the customer with their own words and vocabulary and so on and so forth.\nWhich actually takes me we've been spending a lot of time in that first stage.\nWonder explore explore how do people how do I do I see customers a lot of our customers do do this.\nOften for the less mature PM teams, what happens is a long process of designing the solution followed by a spec followed by a long process of building it.\nAnd in that long process of building it, they use sprints.\nAnd yes, that makes sense.\nBut agile was actually meant to cover both of these things together which is you actually iterate on the solution and you iterate on making it at the same time and you might be uncomfortable for a super long time as this thing is shaping up and that's exactly what it's meant to help you achieve.\nSo but let's start with Xlock.\nSo what do we mean by prototypes and validation here?\nSo what I ask the PMs is create like if you can work on prototypes expose them to the you know you've got 10 customers here in your wonder page great get\n\n\nThe same 10 people in a video after you've presented your solutions and get them to explain how that's solving it for them. That's what I want as to be a for you to be able to exit explore with enough confidence that we should invest a lot in it. So it's basically going back with his customers, iterating on potential solutions, and she's like, \"You know what? We're really on to something here. Here's the proof.\" And it can be things that are very low-fidelity and simple. For example, I'm going to zoom back to five years ago. We were exploring concepts for what turned out to be Jira Product Discovery. And the first prototype we put in front of users was actually that one, which is nothing more but a slide. Mhm. And because we were hearing them talk about all these problems, and we were like, there's a lot there. Like, PMs are having a tough time. What should we help with?\n\nAnd so we, we, we tried, I don't know, countless iterations of that slide where we had different pillars. We put them in different orders. This was probably the last one where everything we realized was centered on prioritization, and everything else was in service of it. Uh, but there were key components we needed to get right that integrate well with it. But what we did is we would create a slide like this, and we would join a call with a PM who would explain their uh, their life and what they were struggling with, and then we pop, show that slide and go, \"So what do you think? Uh, this is a solution we're building. How, how would it help you?\" And we get them to engage with this and uh, and give us feedback. Ah, that's interesting because uh, this bit is uh, quite important, like this bit is quite important for us, but really the stuff I'm struggling with is that, for example, which is where we landed in a lot of conversations, and we found a lot of users to work with there who were able to very crisply define what their problems were. And so one of them, Brent, which is one of our lighthouse customers, we can come back to that later, was saying, \"You know, this is really what it boils down to. I work in a sales-driven organization, and I need to get people rallied behind my priorities, and it's really hard, but I really enjoy when we get to the end of this process and this clarity into what we're building for everyone. It's, it's really joyful when we get there.\" And we're like, \"You know what, we want to help Brent.\"\n\nAnd Brent was validated this one, and then we found other customers, and eventually we narrowed down on that. But that was, that was the prototype, that was the first one. So like, \"Okay, cool, we need to focus on prioritization. How are we going to help them focus on prioritization?\" Initially, we were like, \"You know what, we need to help them with prioritization because they're struggling with working with all these other teams. So, we're going to give them a place where they can have all the feedback going in, and they can, they can prioritize this feedback.\" And uh, look, it looks like um, Gmail, I guess. It's basically an inbox of feedback. We presented that to a few customers. So this one, this one was probably a week spent in Figma discussing potential options, and then we presented that to users, and they were like, \"Oh yeah, that's um, that's interesting. Yeah, I could um, I could use something like that.\" Brent was saying the same stuff, and I was like, \"That's not quite the response I was expecting.\"\n\nOkay, we explored a few other concepts. We went back to Brent and we presented that again. Very simple. It's just like capture, prioritize, deliver, which are the pillars we described in the slide, and then we were centering on ideas here with uh, leathering up to goals, user impact, strategic value, and with a some kind of of a priority score. We presented that to Brent and a bunch of other users, and they were like, \"When can I get this? I'm struggling right now. I've got this conversation coming up with my CPO. We're trying to present a road map. The CPO keeps arguing for us to build a particular feature. We keep thinking we need them to step up, right? Focus on go, focus on goals. Let us do the work of of defining what should be in the product. I need this.\"\n\nThat's when we knew we were on to something, right? We didn't write a single line of code there. Uh, the main reason is like there's no technical complexity in building something like this in Jira, right? We've got all the assets that we need there. So it was basically one PM, two PMs, one designer. We were iterating on this concept. We built a full prototype at some point, and we validated a lot of stuff this way. That was before we wrote a single line of code today. The way we do this is within Lovable, we upload a screenshot from Figma, and we turn it into a prototype, and then we get uh, users in course playing with it. Trying to make it low-fidelity still in u, in um, in Figma, because we still want uh, sorry, in in Lovable, because we still want people to understand it's not a final product and get them to think. Uh, but basically that is the step which for me is super important, which is not jumping straight into building, thinking that you can validate by getting your customers to um, you know, use something, uh, because by the time you get there, you like, you're months later, and you haven't learned anything, and you might be wrong, and it happened to us a few times to be wrong. So that's u, that's that's explore for us, which is really focusing on this and not going all in until we've got enough validation from customers from their mouth that it solves the problems they've stated before. It's a bit unnerving for the new product managers who join the Jira Product Discovery team because they like, we all like to take shortcuts, and it's fine to do it on something small, but not when something is big. And so some initially think it's a waste of time to do all this, but then they realize actually that they don't waste as many cycles on things that in the end are not used by anyone.\n\nLove it.\n\nSo that's the explore phase. Uh, I mean, this one, you'd know what it is, right? You know what you're building, so you're making it. Uh, and this one is about measuring impact. But there's, there's one key thing about this make bit here, which is that one. It's a slide I found uh, from a Reforge course. Uh, and it's about the growth funnel versus the safety funnel. That was a key way for us again to make sure that we don't go too far ahead of ourselves too early. So whenever we've got a concept, let's say um, the concept is the one I was showing just before with the for the prioritization, we don't immediately give it to thousands of customers saying that's it, go and try. It might not fit their environment, and we don't know yet. It might not be ready for them. If it's an early product, maybe they want more compliance controls and like enterprise controls and so on and so forth. The problem is if we get them something which is not good, they're going to come once. They're going to have a look at it, and then they're going to be like, \"It's not for me. Move on,\" and it's going to be an uphill battle to win them back. So instead, I'd rather think of it as a as a queue in front of the nightclub, right? And we let people in as we know they're going to have a good time, not before. That's what in this slide they talked about as the safety funnel. You minimize the number of people who have a bad experience. And then once you know, you know what all the users that we uh, have on this solution now, they're really enjoying it, sees is really high, and so on and so forth. Let's lift the limit. Let's let everyone in. Everyone thought initially in way too conservative when we were doing this because we said we would work with 10 customers, then 100, and then progressively with a thousand. But that really worked for us. By the time we lifted that, we went from 1,000 companies playing with it, not paying, to 18,000 paying for it uh, in less than uh, two years, right? So that's that recipe works. Yeah. The only reasons I'm giving this stat is like it works. Trust me, like there's, there's really something to play with here.\n\nUh, yeah. So that's uh, basically one key thing for when you're between wonder and make, which is be patient, get it right, and then progressively list stuff. I know that's a lot of, we, we watch some of these companies that manage to grow extremely fast, extremely quickly at the moment. I'm thinking of the Lovables, uh, um, like Vzero Bolts of this world. Most businesses are not like that, right? And it's easier to crash and burn by taking this approach than by, you know, being a little bit more methodical in making sure that your users will only like get the thing when it's ready for them, and they're going to have a good time with it, and they're, they're going to want to take out their credit card. And uh, we could have said, you know, you know what, we've already got competitors in this space, and so we have to go fast. The thing is uh, like one of those competitors at 6,000 customers when we started, we, we went triple in two years. So it's like the growth can hockey stick from there. It's just that the product needs to be ready at that point. So as long as you're able to buy the time to get there right, you should absolutely do it from my perspective. So is the advice to quickly release things to the market and get feedback from the market a little bit overrated?\n\nUm, I, I'm not, so it's every question in PM is always, it depends, the answer, right? I know enough now to know that I don't know a lot, uh, but basically, you should try to answer the most important questions. What was the most important question when we started Jira Product Discovery? It was not, can we get this the right solution, because we had answered it with this with a small number of of customers. So we didn't need so much to validate that, but it was more, will people buy it if we have it? So what we did is instead of releasing it and having them buy it, is we started with things like this, which is from one day to the next on the Atlassian website, there was an ad for deep product man, dear product managers, your job is hard because of various reasons. We are um, are you proud to ship? Uh, we'd like to help you. Uh, join us on the journey, put your email. And so for us, that was even without talking about particular the solutions, was that do people connect with this, and is there enough PMs who actually care? Can we reach them? Can we potentially sell things to them? Within two weeks, we had 3,000 companies who had put them their email uh, down on it. And we did some scrubbing from what we had in Salesforce, what we had in our customer base, licensing, and so on and so forth. And we were like, \"Whoa, okay, there is something there.\" That gave us two things. One is validation that yes, there is a there there, and people connect with the seem that they connect with the problems. We had a after those 3,000 uh, emails, we had 50 user interviews from there, and and people really confirmed all of that. So we're like, \"Okay, there's, there's a real thing, there's a real problem,\" and then it's just about, \"Okay, so it looks like we have the uh, like we can reach these people, and these people connect with the problems. We just need to get them the right solution.\" So then our, you know, our focus is doing the right solution, working on it up until we can uh, give it to those uh, companies, right there, which we had segmented into early adopters, not early adopters, enterprise, SMB, you know, all of that stuff, we did our homework there. But basically from there, what we did is progressively give it to more customers uh, based on their appetite to try early-stage stuff. So I wouldn't say you should completely ignore that part, which is get it out there, because distribution is probably the hardest nut to crack, but you need to make sure people don't land with something that's not ready for them, because winning them back is is going to be much harder than waiting until you give it to them. So for us, this playbook works because we built a product by cross-flowing from an existing one. So it really depends as well on your distribution potential and so on and so forth. If I was starting in a startup right now and I had zero customers, I'd probably be talking to the world about it, but I'd still have a wait list because I'd want to drum up interest into a wait list and then progressively take people off the wait list bit by bit for the to get the right references and then to get to prove that we've solved the right problems, get the right quotes, get the right messaging validated, and progressively get something that I can launch and open to to to everyone.\n\nAnd is there any risk when people are using the product for free that you're not going to get the right type of feedback? Sometimes people bring that up. If they're only if they're paying, are you going to get the right type.\n\nYeah, we really like this one was the biggest gamble we made uh, in Jira Product Discovery. At some point, I was uncomfortable with how far we went without having people having to take out the credit card. What it probably depends on which market you're playing in. For us, teams had to invest a lot of time to configure their processes and their workflows in the product. There's no uh, Jira Product Discovery project that looks the same. This is the way we do things in the Jira Product Discovery team, which is very different to how Medibank does things and to many of our other customers. So the fact that they had to spend that time, and then what we realized is that more product managers who were active, like 30%, I think of product managers were active every month, were also active active every day in the product. So we were getting like, they were basically putting a lot of time in there. We were also tracking like how much time do they spend, what are the actions that they're performing, and we were doing regular conversations with them to understand the value they were getting from it, where it was like, \"Well, you know what, if they have to stop using this once we make it paid, it's going to be a major pain,\" but it was still an assumption, and to validate this assumption, we did conjun surveys, and we did a whole bunch of research uh, like we've got a strategy and business operations team like focusing on that. We validated, \"No, no, you really have um, uh, basically people willing to pay here.\" Uh, but for me, I was very uneasy up until I actually saw people taking out the credit card, which is why when I first tried uh, I think it the first one I tried was like Bold, and I had to, I put five prompts, and the sixth one I had to give my credit card. I was like, \"Yeah, that's pretty good. Would I pay 20 bucks for that?\" Yeah.\n\n\nOkay. I want to continue. I was a bit worried for them in that, yeah, I'm putting my credit card now, but I'm probably going to cancel because I don't have an immediate project to use it. So, their turn is probably going to be something and so on. But anyway, it's it really depends on what market you're playing in and the dynamics for how people adopt your tool. For us, in the collaboration space, it's mainly B2B and people have to really put effort into adopting the tool. It's not cheap, it's not free. Once you adopt it, it gives a lot of value, but like removing it is harder. We're in a special circumstance. If I was working on a B2C app, I would probably not do this like that. It's always any question is back to first principles like what's your biggest risk and how do you validate that your gut feel is right?\n\nAnd here I think the key insight is if you're in a market where people are investing a lot of time to change their processes, that already is a significant investment that kind of mirrors pulling out your credit card in a BTOC environment.\n\nYeah, it depends. Uh also, yeah, you're completely right. That one is a like there's a certain resistance to change. So it's really hard to get people to change their way of working. I mean, how many apps do you use every day? If you introduce a new one, you like it's it's it's painful to have to change stuff, right? Uh but also like how critical is the process that you're helping with. So, it might be that people have spent time and they use it often, but it's not that critical. If it's not that critical, then you know the CH like the they might not end up paying. If they really spell it out to you how hard the life was before and you solved it and you also validate that they have the budget because they might also be in a team that doesn't have the budget to pay for stuff like that. So once you put all all this stuff together, you should be able to have a better answer for how do I like when do I ask people to pay. It's never as simple as do it early or do it late. It really depends on the the special circumstances of where you play.\n\nMakes sense. One of the things you said at the beginning was it's not just about discovery then delivery. How do you infuse this process into the make and impact stages?\n\nYeah. So for um whenever we enter make, what we basically have is uh kind of a prototype that has validation with customers. Sometimes we wrote what we call a technical spike which would prove whether we can actually technically do it. So we did it recently for example for the this feature right here where uh we can have um ideas uh that have that are of different types and these ideas can be connected to other things like solutions, iterations, customers, those kinds of stuff. And then visualize those in views that make it look like a hierarchy uh or uh where you can see you know what are the iterations for something or what customers ask for this particular solution that kind of stuff. We were not quite sure whether that would work technically. It was part of explore. We actually had a team who for two weeks try to spike it meaning go in the code try to make it work and anytime they hit a roadblock just document it somewhere saying we need to solve this we need to solve that to get some understanding as to the technical complexity for what we want to to solve and then inform how much how much appetite we've got to actually build it based on that right but when we exit explore we go into make and basically the start of make is always okay so how quickly can we get something in the hands of customers\n\nAnd so what we tend to do is we uh we usually reset the design so whatever we show to customers then we reset and we start iterating again on solutions this time with engineers, designers, and PMs in the same room, right? And so uh you know, like for example, you see uh if you when we start make, like you every Um, every Figma design that we've got in the team, you have a Tonguy tab or a few Tonguy tabs where I take something from the designer and I riff on it based on conversations we had with the designer with the engineers and we basically go through this daily, but we learn somewhere where we're like, \"Okay, cool. Now that's the target. Now, what would a version zero look like?\" And then we go into that and we strip everything away to get to what's the minimum we could give to 10 customers for it. And so we iterate on that with the engineers with the designers. Uh and from there we usually get to a stage where we have something like this which is okay. So based on this, it looks like we've got uh for this feature, we've got to do these three things and then we've got three parallel streams of work that can converge back to milestone zero or milestone 0.5 which is every time I tell them I don't care just tell me whenever I can start playing with it myself and then when we can give to Atlassians and then when we can give to customers and we keep iterating on that weekly, right? So weekly we have a demo and then we look at it ourselves and we see how far we've progressed and we discuss what can we cut or what can we add to make something like to give something. Usually we give it three months maximum before we for a very meaty feature. What would it take to get there? And so this the scope has this tendency to expand and contract and expand and contract as we go through it. The more we understand something, the more the scope expands and then uh after we we feel like we understood it, we understand everything, we cut things back up until we get to something minimal. Um and so it's a bit of a process of shaping. I think there's this methodology as well. I I love the name shape up uh created by base camp, I believe. Yes. Uh and for us, that's really the process of we don't just shape a feature that we design. We the design was here to inform where we want to get to, but then we pair it back 50 clicks into what we're going to ship first. And we go through whiteboards like this to discuss how we're going to do it. And we spend a lot of time in Figma. There's lots of comments there and whatnot. We have this um thing called a live feature document uh where we define our vzer. So as we go through it, we're like, okay, so what are the key flows we want to work and where are they currently? And as we discover more stuff, we add more lines here. And then as we progress, we're like, you know what, this stuff can go to later. And so we keep doing this. We don't do this in Jira. We do this as the whole team, product manager, designer, and engineers. And it's a living document that we update weekly uh like two like at the very beginning, it's like almost every day, and then it's like once a week. And then at some point, we've got a first version that we can give to users. So we give it to 10 users.\nWe work with them and sometimes it can take take a while and then eventually we get to the stage where we want to invite more. But what's quite important here is to have the right tooling to be able to re iterate fast. So uh let me see if I've got this here.\nUh okay. So there's um I do have here uh a shortcut for all the uh branches in Bitbucket where we uh write code and anything that starts with pole is polaris for Jiro discovery and in there we've got all the stuff that's the team is currently working on. So you see all our branches and some branches were updated 30 minutes ago and some were like a couple of hours ago some were yesterday and and whatnot. Right? That's what we're currently working on. The worst thing that could happen is that as a PM I can only work with that when the team is done. So instead is I tell them whenever you create a branch just and there's something for me to look at just send me the branch and it might be a micro change. We change the button we change an interaction and whatnot. But I can go in\nuh Chrome extension and I can for example Oh yeah, that one was pretty cool. So I can reload Joda discovery with that branch. So it's not on master. It's not something that's integrated into our test environment. So like I mean it's not ready. It's not in the pipeline to go to production. It's just a branch. It might be throw away. But that's how we can test a lot of stuff. And so this one for example was hey what would it look like if we had uh whiteboards in\nuh which we don't yet. uh but we were like all right let's integrate whiteboards from conference and now I'm actually in a branch and I can work with my ideas here in uh whiteboards and drag and drop them and and stuff like that. That was a concept that was built in three days uh by one of our uh engineers in an innovation week uh by using the components we've got internally like white bots from conference but that tooling you see here the the thing is purple it means that there's a branch active and it's that branch is what we use to iterate fast internally as we test this and then eventually we're like you know what we're getting close we should be giving it to 10 customers\nUm,\nand usually we're about halfway because then there's like the polishing and the making sure that okay, have we thought about um the like how it's going to impact this part of the code, that part of the code. Are we like do we have minimum test coverage at least to make sure that we're not breaking important things. Uh we're building a complex app. It looks simple but it's pretty complex in the in the back end. And so that's um uh uh the the kind of stuff that we do. So when we're 80% done, we're about halfway through. We polish that. We give it to to to 10 customers and then we keep iterating from there and we have, you know, we we're with them on Slack. We get into Zoom calls with them. We look at their feedback. We keep addressing it and at some point we're like, it looks like it's good enough. We make it available to 100 customers and the cycle repeats and then eventually we give it to everyone. But in between we make sure that whatever we thought would happen actually happens or we learn from it and we change the app. So that's uh in a nutshell uh basically how we work with during the make phase to make it so that it's not just here's a spec build it ship it but instead we keep iterating and we keep infusing user feedback into what we did. So it's we we love to get something to customers in one month. Now we're at the stage where it's more like three months before we get something. But the feature might take, you know, six six plus months to be fully ready, but as early as possible, we're trying to get users to actually play with this.\n\nIf people want to get in touch with you or learn more, where should they go? Uh yeah, the easiest is uh you can find me on LinkedIn. I'm not super active, but uh definitely you can reach out, send me a message. Uh uh that kind of stuff. If you're a user of JRo Discovery, LinkedIn, the JRO Discovery community group, uh you know, you can find me there. I mean, you've probably seen my face already in a thousand looms. Uh but I'm always happy to have a chat uh especially if you uh you've got a story that you think we should listen to, uh for how to evolve, uh the product and almost everyone listening is probably a Jira customer. Is there any specific way they can reach out to you if they are that? Yeah, the Jera the Discovery community group. You just Google Jira the discovery community we are there uh and listening like um the one I shared today was literally from today so proof that that we actually watch this uh yeah and again LinkedIn as well that works.\n\nSo, if you want to learn more about how to shift to this way of working, check out our full conversation on Apple or Spotify podcasts. And if you want the actual documents that we showed, the tools and frameworks and public links, be sure to check out my newsletter post with all of the details. Finally, thank you so much for watching. It would really mean a lot if you could make sure you are subscribed on YouTube, following on Apple or Spotify podcasts, and leave us a review on those platforms. That really helps grow the podcast and support our work so that we can do bigger and better productions. I'll see you in the next one.\n",
