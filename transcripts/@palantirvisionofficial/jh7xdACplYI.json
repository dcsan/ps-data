  "cleanText": "Welcome back.\n\nI made a video yesterday on paler.\n\nStocks declined at the end of the day yesterday, which came as a bit of a surprise with the news announcement coming out around potential reduction in defense spending.\n\nPaler lost 10%, has lost another 10% today, going as low as $9.5 per share.\n\nThis is coming off about 25% from where it was trading a couple of days ago, and now the question we have to ask is what's going to happen from here.\n\nSo I have many thoughts about that, but I also want to throw in something else, which is paler recently released its 10K filing, and these filings are annual filings where they're required by the SEC to disclose any material changes in the business in addition to latest financials.\n\nBut the financials are not the interesting part because we already knew that from their quarterly release.\n\nWhat's interesting is the changes from their last fiscal year to this fiscal year's report, which is represented in the black line report through fax set software.\n\nCost thousands of dollars, but it's worth it to be able to share these videos with you and show the actual fundamental differences in what exactly has changed in what paler is reporting to investors.\n\nOtherwise, you would have to read hundreds of pages and cross reference.\n\nIt's really a lot of work, so I'm summarizing this for you.\n\nPalente hidden details from the 10K, and you can make up your own mind as to whether or not this is impacting the stock because I think the defense spending reduction is more of a neutral news story for paler, and some of these other things we're going to get into may or may not have had a bigger impact.\n\nSo let's get started.\n\nThe first of which, again, some of these are small, some of these are not so small, but we have Alex Karp as of the beginning of fiscal year 2024 began to use an aircraft Ben officially owned by him, known as the executive aircraft, for non-commercial airflight for business and personal travels, and during the year the company incurred expenses related to the use of the executive aircraft being $7.7 million.\n\nSo I'm glad to see something like this is happening.\n\nOf course, it's an expense to the company, but take flight very seriously, um, especially for our CEO.\n\nAdditionally, we have what seems like the elimination of peners focus.\n\nI don't think it was ever ever a very large focus, but focus nonetheless on diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nWe know this has been a focus of the recent Trump Administration, moving away from DEI, and many other companies are following suit.\n\nIt looks like paler has removed this from their disclosure to investors about what their DEI team does, and I don't know if it was ever a driving force.\n\nI think pter was always very merit driven, but nevertheless, being a tech company, I think you certainly are beholden to uh certain things and even getting investors a lot of that uh ESG and the governance and this and you know, whatever may have played a part, but it looks like they're now moving on from that.\n\nMake that make of that what you will.\n\nWe have the interest expense, a lot of mentions to this being being actually uh deleted and removed, moved because paler is cashr.\n\nThey're no longer paying interest expense, which is great.\n\nWe know interest rates are still fairly high.\n\nThey're actually earning those interest rates and interest income, and they've pretty much removed all references to interest expense, unless I'm incorrect, which I do not believe I am.\n\nWe also have the elimination here of IM mention of alternative Investments.\n\nSo that's where they said our alternative Investments include gold bars and are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet.\n\nSo as far as far as I understand this, it looks like they have actually sold their gold bars.\n\nI don't know if if I can't confirm this to be true, but usually when you're removing something like this, it tends to indicate that is the outcome, and so that was a very small uh impact for paler.\n\nI believe it was only $50 million, which is very inconsequential at this point.\n\nI'm sure they made money on the investment, but let's move on here.\n\nThey've also eliminated uh some text around business combinations, which was in respect to paler Japan and some ownership there.\n\nI don't think they have divested from these Investments, but they're putting less of a focus on them.\n\nSo again, less material in my opinion.\n\nThis is worth mentioning, like they're changing the language, they're less focused around business combinations, which I think is a good direction for where they should be going.\n\nThey should be very focused on their first party work, their platforms, and what they're doing there and less of like an inorganic partnership to buy Revenue, which is what this back debacle was about, and I think obviously that is way behind the company, but even something like this.\n\nPartnerships are great, I think, but it's almost in my opinion a lot of extra work for not as much benefit, and I could be totally wrong in certain situations, but I personally would love to see the paler Engineers working on making the platform better, more accessible, more self-serve, and so there's less of a burden to actually working with it and scaling with it, um, and moving moving forward with it.\n\nSo now we get to the part about the insider trading arrangements.\n\nWe covered this yesterday.\n\nWe do have a new part here as well, but Alex Karp has filed to sell 9,975,000 shares, which is the maximum number of shares, so it could be less and subject to taxes.\n\nThat's going to be an enormous tax bill, but this is plus or minus $1 billion.\n\nNow paler trades north of $20 per share, so you consider half a percent of the market cap is what he could be selling over time, over six months or whatever it may be, the duration of the trading arrangement is until September 12th, 2025 or earlier, and that's what we have there.\n\nIn addition, Stephen Cohen, president, secretary, and member of board of directors, adopting a similar arrangement in the rule 10b5-1, providing the potential sales of Class A shares through various transactions upon the occurrence and satisfaction of certain price and other conditions with 4,600,000 shares being the total of the maximum number of sh.\n\nIt's just this is lawyer language, which is just mind-numbing to read.\n\nThat is an equally large and I think less talked about figure, right?\n\nIt's not 10 million, but it is 4 million, so that's about $400 million worth of shares, unless I'm wrong, and of course, the share price has declined, so by the time he sells it, it could be less, but nevertheless, that is an enormous number of shares.\n\nThey're both filing this through the annual report, so it's not, I don't think this is anything you can say is related to the fundamentals where they're trying to get as many shares sold as soon as possible, right?\n\nBecause this is a a routine, regular time in which you would file to sell, which is the annual uh disclosure to investors.\n\nSo I don't think this is an alarming a short-term signal, but it it does signal that these co-founders, there are four of them, and two of them are represented here, are continuing to divest over their uh internal holdings.\n\nSo again, you got to sort of come to the conclusion of what you think that means in your own internal beliefs as an investor, but again, they get issued shares as part of their service to the company, which means they're never going to be buying shares because they get issued them as their employment allows.\n\nThey're probably going to be selling them at some point, so when the stock goes up five times, 10 times, 15 times, you know, they don't know where the stock is going either.\n\nI'm sure they didn't want it to fall from $45 to $5, so they couldn't control that much, much like they can't control it going to $125.\n\nSo all of that to say, insiders are going to sell.\n\nThis happens for every company.\n\nThese are some large sales.\n\nThere's no sugar coating in it.\n\nHowever, I do not think this is the the end of the stocks run, nor is it the end of this great company driven by these incredible co-founders.\n\nWe also have the departure of the Chief Accounting Officer.\n\nThis is not new, however, we know that it lists here in the 10K that David Glazer, who is Palantir's CFO, is taking over on an interim basis.\n\nHe will assume the responsibilities of principal accounting officer effective February 25th, and presumably they may or may not be filling that position.\n\nI think David Glazer has done an incredible job with the financials.\n\nThis company has been fundamentally sound since the beginning, lumpy behavior when it came to the growth, but largely out of his control, and he's done an incredible job shoring up the financial abilities of this company, so he will now be taking on more responsibilities.\n\nOkay, another thing we have here is just Palantir noting that when they're displaying their revenue chart, they're saying that in the green part down here, generally increases in revenue from our existing customers are related to increased adoption of our products and services within their organizations, and you might say, well, obviously, but it's still an important addition.\n\nThey chose to add this for a reason, right?\n\nAnd now why do they choose to add this?\n\nThey chose to add it, I think, because they're saying that the increased adoption within the organizations is what they're seeing is driving a lot of growth.\n\nNow this is great news.\n\nIf you've been following paler for a long time, we know the land and expand strategy is very important to them, and if they're continuing to see the ability of these companies to continue to adopt a lot of the products, even after they've gotten onboarded, that's a big deal because we know that's going to drive net dollar retention, which is a key metric for software companies, and it's just great for the overall business.\n\nYou don't one of the one of the sayings in business is the easiest customer to sell to is someone that's already bought for you, uh, because they already have that relationship.\n\nThere's no additional cost associated with with acquiring a customer, right?\n\nSo this is great news for banteer overall that they're willing to say that the organizations are continuing to adopt their products at an increasing rate.\n\nLast thing we have here that I wanted to mention that they added under customer impact, this section that just gives investors an understanding of what paler products are actually uh making possible, and it's this example where it says a European telecommunications company needed to process personal data for a customer support workflow while complying with the necessity and proportionality requirements of the European General data protection regulation, the GDPR, which in my opinion is an absolute nightmare.\n\nI've never dealt with it, but I know there's a lot of problems with that, and it seems like a solution that paler could provide.\n\nSo it says the client leveraged paler minimization tool to off youate sensitive data in workflows while allowing cell level access by operational user users based on demonstrated needs.\n\nSo the reason I read that, there are still so many untapped paler solutions, like they're continuing year after year to update their filings based on just random things that their product is now being used for that was never used for in the past, and it shows that there's really a benefit to this technology almost in every n domain you can think of.\n\nI have a lot of great video ideas for what I'll be making next.\n\nI think you're really going to enjoy it, so let me know what you thought about this.\n\nUntil next time.\n",
