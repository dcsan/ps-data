  "cleanText": "Welcome back.\n\nMy last two videos have done really well, so you all have inspired me to make another one.\n\nToday, the premise of this video is as it pertains to Palantir stock: dumb money selling to smart money.\n\nNow, dumb money, the definition being retail investors, and smart money essentially being institutional investors.\n\nAnd this is a question of what don't we know, because institution... and I don't want to spoil the video, but in introducing it, it's like this is a really critical juncture for the Palantir story with such an epic move up.\n\nAnd I think we need to get to the bottom of this question: what exactly is going on?\n\nBecause this is something I have been grappling with recently as someone closely following the Palantir story, trying to figure out how is it that institutions are buying at such an all-time high and at the same time retail is either selling or neutral.\n\nIt just something doesn't add up here.\n\nSo this is why I've dug into it.\n\nWe know that Palantir bottomed under $6 in December of 2022 and is now north of $100 in February.\n\nAnd this, I just cited this Yahoo Finance article saying that obviously this move has been driven both by institutional and retail, but retail is on the former part of that rise, institutional is uh much further after.\n\nAnd they say just a few years ago PLTR was nearly written off, yet now it commands attention across markets.\n\nThis really is absolutely the case.\n\nPeople are asking what is the next Palantir?\n\nPeople are saying when is my stock going to have a Palantir moment?\n\nI have more thoughts on that in another video, but it is true what has occurred, and it's been driven by both groups, but in this video we're trying to figure out is retail buying or selling.\n\nSome like me believe that retail investors are sort of dumping.\n\nSo you can see on the timeline, some investors on X are saying they've sold all their shares, which does make sense after a large move up.\n\nWe're sort of stabilizing around $100.\n\nOf course, we've had that move where we dropped off from 125 or so down to 100, down to 95, and so some people might see this is the time to get out.\n\nBut there are some flows that show that actually there's been hundreds of millions of net buying this this month, which I find a little surprising.\n\nBut we know this is a huge retail name, increasingly so.\n\nFrom the beginning, it was primarily retail because they did a direct listing, and now it's increasingly uh both.\n\nBut as the stock gets more and more expensive, as the valuation increases, it's going to be more and more driven by institutions, which is why this question and this premise of the video is so important.\n\nRetail demand has outpaced and been in line with many of the largest tech stocks, obviously only trailing Nvidia and Tesla um for for the title of the most traded by retail investors.\n\nSo here we have Robinhood's data for investors, retail investors on their platform.\n\nSo obviously it's limited to their customers, but as we can see, they've been net selling a lot.\n\nThere's some net buy days, but a lot of net selling more recently.\n\nSome Robinhood investors have been stepping in, but yeah, this is sort of where the conflict of who are we trusting here with the retail data is sort of showing.\n\nBut if you do want to look at hedge funds, they've been much more as a as a proxy for institutional buying, much more net buyers.\n\nSo I just want to clear this up.\n\nAny of the conflict on the data here, in my opinion, is retail are have been and potentially may continue to be net sellers.\n\nInstitutions are and potentially will continue to be net buyers, which I think is great.\n\nRetail, take it or leave it, very momentum driven.\n\nI think the Palantir investor community, the core Palantir retail investor community, is some of the smartest investors as a group.\n\nI believe it's actually one of the smartest.\n\nIf you look, this is a topic for another video, but truly incredible.\n\nI wouldn't say we had the most brilliant individual minds, but as a collective, I would be hard pressed to find a core investor group that is smarter than Palantir.\n\nBut again, I'll cover that later.\n\nAnd big players are stepping in, not only as institutional ownership nearly half now from much, much lower years ago, we now have politicians buying for the very first time.\n\nThis is just a quote, but it's common sense: politicians often move in early if they sense upcoming contract awards.\n\nWe know there's controversy about what politicians are are not able to buy as a result of inside information they may or may not have.\n\nSo we get to see what they disclose as their positions and them buying Palantir for the very first time, interesting moment for multiple politicians to buy for the very first time when none of them have bought previously.\n\nSo you got to sort of wonder about that.\n\nAnd this all comes after the momentum of the S&P 500, all the indices, and uh everything that Palantir has achieved.\n\nWhy is 2025 the time when institutions are plowing in and politicians are buying in?\n\nWhat do they know that we don't know?\n\nBecause as far as I'm concerned, the retail, of course we think Palantir is a huge winner long term, but we're a little uncertain, if I can speak for all of retail, which I will not uh do very often, but I don't for see a rise of Palantir 10 times in the next in the next year.\n\nSo clearly there is some sort sort of knowledge, whether it's inside knowledge as it pertains to like new contracts coming very soon that's going to make the stock increase in value, or if it's a more of a medium-term understanding uh that this Palantir train is not going to get stopped.\n\nSo of course, a lot of that comes down to the contracts and the fundamentals.\n\nWe've had a lot of these big wins that have been announced more recently.\n\nThe stock has been doing great as a result of the incredible financial fundamentals.\n\nSo politicians are buying, clearly they again the benefit of the doubt that they don't have specific inside information, although that has historically not been the case, and they have traded on financially privileged information.\n\nI do think that regardless of whether or not they do, they are only buying for one reason, and that is because they understand the stock will appreciate in value, much like we do, but they are now buy for the first time above $100 per share, which is a little different, because if you're an institutional or rather a retail trader that has bought the stock at $10, it's a little different than buying for the first time at 100.\n\nSo they better be expecting some pretty big news and movement.\n\nAdditionally, we know that Elon Musk, he's been working intensively with the government, the Trump administration, Doge, the effort to apply software and really cut down on a lot of the excessive spending.\n\nPalantir is great at all of that, and this has been said before, so I'm not going to say this again.\n\nHowever, what I do want to say is Elon Musk's xAI has recently released Grok 3, which is a big breakthrough, and finally they are now a state-of-the-art model when it comes to large language models.\n\nThat crown is going to last very shortly because GP5 is incorporating an even larger and more powerful reasoning model, which is due in May, and CS Anthropic is releasing their next generation as soon as next week potentially.\n\nSo Grok 3 will hold the crown.\n\nThey say it's going to get better, but I think short term uh that may get disrupted.\n\nI personally think Open AI is going to win 2025, but I believe xAI will win 2026.\n\nSo of course, they're starting from a bit of a disadvantage because they only started 18 months ago.\n\nThey made incredible progress.\n\nAll of this to say, the connection is we know Elon Musk and Alex Karp have forged quite a friendship more recently, and now they're working aggressively with xAI to integrate Grok 3.\n\nNow this is great because Elon's only going to want to use his model, which makes sense because he has trust issues with Open AI.\n\nSo when it comes to applying AI to the government, he's going to want to use Grok.\n\nWho best utilizes Grok?\n\nWell, it's Palantir.\n\nThey've been testing Grok to now.\n\nGrok 3 is much more powerful.\n\nWe know this is a big deal if you're able to incorporate these reasoning models into AI and and anything else.\n\nSo I think this goes understated, the relationship, not just Elon and Karp, but also Grok, you know, from the makers of xAI and now AIP.\n\nI think the relationship is much more fundamental than some people are making it sound like, and that's a big deal.\n\nNow, the valuation debate, this is going to be ongoing, but the PE ratio obviously is in the hundreds, but that's a trailing multiple.\n\nIf you understand the difference, you don't want to look back at Palantir's last 12 months of earnings, you want to look forward at their next 12 months of earnings, and that's when this $50 number gets much lower.\n\nIt's cut in half, basically.\n\nSo with gross stocks, you don't want to look back, you want to look forwards.\n\nAnd we have a very wide range of analyst targets from the 30s to well over 100.\n\nI believe I saw one in the 160s, not from a reputable firm, but I think that's maybe where it is.\n\nSo high multiples game signal risk and optimism.\n\nI mean, it's both, really.\n\nBut as it stands now, it's really interesting that institutions are buying at this level.\n\nI think that Palantir is not necessarily going to get less volatile, as we've seen after S&P 500, that has not reduced reduced the volatility, so always be a high beta stock.\n\nHowever, I do think it reduces the downside.\n\nDo I ever see Palantir falling below $50 again?\n\nNo.\n\nNever say never.\n\nIf we're talking about where it could fall to, I think it would be important to say the last previous all-time high was $45.\n\nSo in a doomsday scenario, do I see Palantir going below $50?\n\nNo.\n\nDo I see it going below $45?\n\nDefinitely not.\n\nAnd I think the institutional buying is a big factor in that.\n\nIf I can find the word, because institutions would not be buying so high if they knew there was a a risk that they essentially were going to lose 60% on the stock if it plummets.\n\nThey're backing this stock, not only will it not go down because they're buying, but it's it's really a confirmation of the story, the future of the company, and backing it.\n\nThey're they're willing to pay almost any price, it looks like, which is truly incredible.\n\nIt sure looks like it's happening.\n\nSo I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\nUntil next time.\n",
