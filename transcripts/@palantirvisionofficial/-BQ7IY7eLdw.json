  "cleanText": "Welcome back.\n\nI've got a great video for you all today, talking about my experience at Palantir's first big event of 2025, DevCon2, that just wrapped up this evening.\nI was in attendance for their two-day event, their second-ever developer conference, on the heels of their first DevCon in November of last year, and I want to tell you all about it, what I learned, my takeaways, and it was a blast, and it went by so quickly.\nHere's proof of my attendance.\nAnd, uh, yes, I was in attendance, not for having a sizable social media following in the Palantir space, but rather, I submitted, if I say so myself, a rather impressive demo and how you're able to use a logic in a consumer use case with respect to using it to perform actions in applications that you might be using in everyday workflows, like Microsoft Excel.\nSo I submitted that.\nPalantir invited me.\nAgain, had nothing to do with my channel, and I wasn't allowed to record, and as far as I understand, there's no media presence.\nAfter all, this was a developer conference, but I am able to talk to you about what occurred.\nSo my main takeaway here is the Palantir hype is real.\nI was in the Palantir office.\nThey won't... they made it clear they don't want me to say where it was, but hundreds of developers were flying in from all over and convening in the Palantir office and with tons of Palantir engineers also flying in from all of Palantir's offices, and you can really sense the excitement and the magic of what Palantir is building, uh, not only on the product side of things, but especially in the community, and that's what events like this are all about.\nAnd developers, and not, of course, not everyone there is a developer.\nI'm certainly not a developer, uh, but people that are representing startups or people... I spoke to a number of people in different roles, obviously, in addition to Palantir employees.\nWe have people representing IT departments, which has been a big factor in who Palantir is able to sell to as well as less technical people within organizations that work with Palantir and they low-code, no-code tooling, especially as AIP has come to the forefront.\nSo the hype is certainly real, and when you're able to see it firsthand, you're able to see the products get built in real time, in hours, not weeks or months or years.\nIt's truly impressive, and I want to tell you more about it.\nFirst, big shout out to Tom and Tom from the London office, who I was working with, Palantir engineers assigned to my build team.\nI was working with some other Palantir and members of the Palantir investor community who happened to be technical, but we were working with Tom and Tom.\nThey were fantastic, doing everything they could to help us succeed.\nIt was their first time at a DevCon, coming again, coming over from London to the US, and it was fantastic to learn from them, work alongside them for the two days as they were bouncing between the different groups and primarily helping us as other Palantir engineers were coming in and out and, uh, supporting us in our build journey.\nSo I made this little table here just to sort of represent.\nI feel like there are a lot of levels to the Palantir game when it comes to understanding the Palantir story, and the different dimensions are, I believe, level one, all of you have just watching this video is a surface involvement in the Palantir story, understanding, you know, the basics, the fundamentals about the stock, about the products, the technology.\nAnd then I feel like probably some of you have reached financial master.\nI think I certainly have, when you have a very deep understanding, if you had the financial chops, I think you're sort of towards level two.\nAnd then there's level three, which I hadn't come close to until earlier this year when I started building on the developer tier of Palantir AIP and Foundry, which is the technical understanding.\nAnd if you're able to reach level three, which I think a lot of us in the Palantir investor community haven't, and um, that's due to the fact that a lot of us are in other fields, but if you're able to to reach level three and go to Palantir boot camps or workshops that I'm about to talk about, um, or otherwise build on Palantir offering, I think you have the trifecta of understanding the levels to the Palantir game when it comes to investing in this company and, uh, doing it for the right reasons, which is you understand the fundamental story and it's not an investment based on Alex Karp's hair or based on the stock, uh, momentum and how it's been going up, but you're able to make an investment from a basis that is justifiable and is long-term in nature and in focus.\nAnd I think I have you stepping out of this two-day event, reach that level three and am in a unique position to be able to share my understanding with all of you, and I don't know if there's anyone else, any other Palantir content creators that, uh, really hit that watermark, so I'm excited to be able to bring, uh, bring more of this knowledge to all of you.\nSo what happened at DevCon 2?\nI'm sure you're all wondering.\nPalantir didn't live stream the whole thing like they do for some other events.\nI know, uh, some of the videos will be coming out.\nI, I'm not going to talk to the specifics, signed an NDA, of course.\nI'll speak in general, and I definitely recommend, uh, you should certainly apply if you're interested if they will be hosting a DevCon 3 in whenever, hopefully later this year, uh, given their cadence between the first two, but they made it clear they were not committing to a timeline yet on DevCon 3, but regardless, you should certainly apply to attend.\nUm, I definitely recommend it.\nAnd so what happened across the two days?\nProduct launches.\nThere were comments on my last video, \"Oh, you can't say Palantir is launching things this week.\"\nOf course, they aren't, and that didn't make any sense.\nUm, these launches are not new platforms that move the stock one day to the next, but they're incremental and in some cases monumental jumps in the capabilities of what the SDKs are able to do, of what AIP is capable of, really everything you can think of that sure, there are small changes in the grand scheme of things, but they unlock incremental use cases that were not before possible.\nAnd so there's not one single thing I would point to, but of course, a focus on agents, which is huge.\nAnd I want to talk about the workshops, which were great.\nI believe there were three, maybe there were four, um, but three that I can, uh, think of where we were sitting down and we were following all of the instructions, uh, in real time, turn by turn, on our own, uh, device, on our own laptops, on the Foundry stack, and I'm sure that's pretty similar to a boot camp.\nSo I essentially got to go through, you know, wasn't my own data that we were using, but go through a simulated boot camp, uh, and get that hands-on experience and work with the Palantir engineers that were able to help me when I got stuck and lost on certain, uh, certain steps.\nSo that was huge.\nAnd then we finished up with the build competition, and since there were a couple hundred, uh, actual attendees, there were roughly 40 teams or so, and and there were a number of different verticals.\nWe were assigned.\nI was on the consumer AI group.\nWe presented to a smaller pod, which then, uh, moved on and chose another group, but then we watched the final presentations all together.\nAnd so I don't know if I'm allowed to speak to the specifics of what our group worked on, but, uh, I'd love to tell you about what essentially happened in the in what you got, what I got to see from the finals, which was in just 10 hours of working across two days on a totally new use case that we were starting from scratch on using AIP logic functions and of course, Foundry's ontology, you're able to create really compelling products in a matter of hours that could actually provide business value, and it's like what Palantir says, you hear it on the conference call, you read it, but it's actually true, like I saw it happen firsthand, and it's really incredible what's possible when you get brilliant minds on board using Palantir and then they get to have a little bit of time and familiarity with the products and what comes of it, and it's, it's hard to overstate what is possible.\nSo I do want to... I'm not sure why this image is cut off, but I do want to mention this since it was posted publicly about Palantir, but XAI is working directly with Palantir, which of course, we sort of already knew that, but we didn't necessarily know was XAI is directly working with Palantir and Palantir's customers.\nThey were on stage, and we also got to witness, uh, presentation by one of the co-founders of XAI, Jimmy Ba, who's just fresh off his, uh, presentation launching Grok 3 alongside Elon Musk, whatever that was, a week or two ago, and, uh, he gave us a similar rundown, and we had some XAI for deployed engineers talking to us about how much they want to work with Palantir customers, many of whom are in the audience on their specific use cases, specifically as it relates to unlocking those in Palantir Foundry and AIP.\nSo it's crazy that all these AI companies are now adopting the for deployed engineer model, and now they're, they're trying to fight each other to be Palantir's top AI partner, I guess you could say, or go-to.\nAnd XAI talked a lot about speed.\nThey want to be there for Palantir's customers, and they, they demonstrated some use cases of that, which I think is huge, and, uh, they're certainly killing it with their recent releases, and it's a great partnership for Palantir to have.\nSo my key takeaways here: the developer community is growing every day, so much excitement in the group on building on what Palantir had already released, what they're going to continue to release, and the product releases are not slowing down, they are accelerating, even stuff that Palantir didn't, uh, talk about that they were launching when we were talking with engineers in some of their, in some of their, um, small group demos and conversations that I had, they were saying, like, \"Oh yeah, we're scoping that, we're working on it.\nWe don't know, we know exactly when we're going to get to it, but we're going to tackle that.\nIt's going to unlock more use cases.\"\nAnd so the bottom line here is almost anything is possible with Foundry and AIP in the enterprise.\nIt totally unlocked for me so many ideas that I think are going to be so transformative, uh, when it comes to what, what businesses are going to be leveraging their, their data for going forward.\nSo it was an incredible experience.\nI'm, I'm a bit tired from the, uh, the, um, the 48 hours, but, uh, I hope this video helps you understand what exactly it was like to attend DevCon 2.\nAgain, Palantir is going to be putting out some of this content, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, but the hype is real.\nI'd love to answer anything else you want to know about the DevCon 2 in general terms.\nAgain, I didn't record anything.\nI'm not speaking out of turn here, but fantastic event, really grateful to Palantir for the opportunity to attend, and I implore you to do so if you are able to next time.\nThanks for watching.\nUntil next time.\n",
