  "cleanText": "Today we're going to be talking about\nPalantir valuation as we close out the year.\nNearing the end of 2024, Palantir has\nabsolutely dominated in the public\nmarkets, surpassing, far surpassing\n$100 billion.\nAs we all know, and you know, beginning of the year, the\nstock was at $15, and it's crazy to say,\nmy bull case was the stock was going to\ndouble, but as you've seen, it's just been\non uh an incredible trajectory really\never since.\nEver since it broke out past\n$20, it maintained that, and then it's\ncrazy because in August it was $20, like\nit literally hit\n$20 um when there was a market downturn,\nand it's just been an explosion ever\nsince, driven in much part by the\nfundamentals as well as multiple\nexpansion.\nAnd what I want to do in this\nvideo is, I haven't looked at any of this\nyet, but what I want to do is go through\nthis with you.\nIn this video, we're\ngoing to look at all of the different uh\nvaluation metrics for Palantir and how it\ncompares to them historically to see, you\nknow, in my head, like, you obviously have\nto think a stock goes from $15 to $70 in\none year, they're probably overvalued, um\nbut I want to see maybe is the opposite\nactually true.\nSo we're going to look\nthrough this together and explore.\nI just\nhave the price to earnings ratio last 12\nmonths.\nBy the way, this is FactSet, a\ngreat uh professional tool, you know, all\nthings Finance, so we'll be using this uh\nvery high quality data.\nSo we see, you\nknow, Palantir fairly recently profitable\nand uh therefore we don't have as much\ndata in the lifetime of the company, but\nit's never a very good idea to look back\non the last 12 months for a price to\nearnings ratio when you're talking about\na growth company, so I'm pretty much\ngoing to ignore this.\nSo let's take a\nlook instead at a price earnings ratio\nfor the next 12 months.\nAgain, this is my\nfirst time seeing this.\nI want to put it\non the five-year um the 5-year mark, and\nso if we compress this a little bit, we\ncan see Palantir essentially went public in\n2020 at around 100 times their uh\nearnings, and this is adjusted, so then\nthey spiked all the way up to 300 and\nthen collapsed.\nSo like this is obviously\nin hindsight a fantastic place to be\nbuying Palantir, which is when they still\nhad growth, but the market was really, you\nknow, valuing them at 33 times.\nWhat is\nthat?\nThat's who trades for 33 times?\nCostco trades for like 60 times, like how\nhow come Palantir was trading for 30 times?\nI don't know, but anyway, the point of um\nof this video is to compare what we're\ncurrently seeing is Palantir trading at\n160 times their next 12 months earnings.\nAgain, not a fantastic um not a fantastic\nway to look at things because in in in\nan industry that has such great\ntailwinds, again, next 12 months is still\na little limiting, but it's better than\nlooking backwards nonetheless.\nAnd so you\nsee this is by no means the highest that\nPalantir has traded in terms of its next 12\nmonths price to earnings ratio.\nIt's\nalmost been twice as high.\nSo um\nobviously it's come up a lot when we\nlook at where it was a few months ago,\nit's more than doubled, obviously with\nthe stock as we know, but it's just good\nto see that reference point that when\nPalantir is at an all-time high by almost\ndouble right now, that it's still far\nbelow where it was in peak euphoria of\n2020 or even um in into uh the beginning\nof 2021.\nSo let's have a look to price to\nearnings growth as well.\nSo what this\ndoes is it, oh, I don't want both of those.\nLet's just look at one.\nSo what this does\nis it um takes the priced earnings ratio\nfor the next 12 months and divides it by\nthe growth that the company uh is seeing.\nSo what we see here is, you know, a\nsimilar story, um but again, it it used to\ntrade for a lot more and then fell off a\ncliff, and uh that was sort of when the\nstock was collapsing, and then we had\nthis consolidation around around one\ntimes, which is a fantastic one times,\nyour price to earnings growth is a\nfantastic uh truly an incredible place\nto to buy a growth company if you know\nit's going to uh be successful, and then\nthe explosion beginning of the year when\nthe stock broke out a little bit around\nthree times.\nNow we're at four times,\nwhich she is a little overheated, I must\nsay.\nUsually you'll see probably no more\nthan three times for uh a growth company,\nbut what you have to consider with\nsomething like this is the growth, the\nhigher the growth, the lower this goes,\nwhich means you're you're obviously\ngetting a better deal for the stock.\nSo\nif you think Palantir is growing to is\ngoing to actually grow into its\nvaluation pretty significantly, which is\na part of the uh the bull thesis, then it\nmight not look too outlandish, but this\ndoes show, you know, some pause that you\nwould want to have, you know, over four\ntimes uh is is a little excess.\nSo now\nlet's have a look at an interesting one\nwhich would be price to cash flow.\nSo um\nyeah, we don't want to look at the book\nvalue.\nWhat we can see here is cash flow\nis obviously an incredibly important\nmetric for a software company like\nPalantir, um which is where it's getting all\nof its valuation from is its ability to\ngenerate free cash flow.\nYeah, we see this\ntremendous spike when Palantir initially\nwent public, and we can kind of ignore\nthat.\nSo that's I'm actually just going\nto get that off\nbecause um is very much an outlier and\nnot really at all where the company\nshould be valued.\nSo let me bring this a\nlittle more into frame here, and we're\ngoing to see, you know, as with all of\nthese, following the stock, but it's\noverlaid with the fundamentals, which is\nwhat's nice about these valuation.\nEnd of\n2021, we were seeing the stock at around\n70 times, it looks like about 60, 70 times\nuh cash flow, and uh then as low as 40\ntimes.\nAnd so this is, you know, you could\nthink of it in a similar way to priced\nearnings, and then uh yeah, pretty in a\npretty pretty reasonable range of uh you\nknow, 35 to 70.\nPalantir is a very volatile\nstock, and now and now up to 121 times\ncash flow, which is, you know, is a lot.\nAgain, but Palantir is going to grow into this.\nIt's a little bit above\nthe previous high from middle of 2021,\nbut not too significantly, and so I\nexpect this multiple to come down over\ntime, and I think 2025 is going to be a\nyear where Palantir really grows into its\nvaluation a good amount.\nSo we can also\nlook at price to sales, which is uh\ninteresting.\nLet me get for the lifetime\nof the company, obviously the value of\nthe company divided into its sales, and\nthe sales have obviously been increasing,\nbut so is the valuation.\nAnd so, you know,\nthis basically mirrors the actual uh\nstock chart for Palantir, as low as 15 times\nsales, as high in the first peak of 40\ntimes, and now roughly uh 48 times.\nSo not\ntoo far above the previous peak, but\npretty similar to the stock chart that\nwe're seeing.\nAnd so definitely you're\nyou're paying a lot when you're\ncomparing it to sales, you're paying 48\ntimes, which, you know, usually tech\ncompanies would be far less than 20.\nThat's another metric that looks a\nlittle hot, but again, I think if you look\nat it a year from now, it's going to be\nmuch lower.\nAnd then if you want to give\nPalantir the benefit of all of its cash, you\ncan actually do the enterprise value to\nsales, which shows things a little better\nbecause they have so much cash, which is\nplays into the calculation of enterprise\nvalue.\nUh, so if you want to look at it\nthat way, we can also look at the uh\nenterprise value to EBITDA ratio.\nSo this\nis this is a good one to look at.\nIt's\ngiving us a good comparison to Palantir's\nprevious peak after it went public.\nSo it\nactually went public at a 86 times EV to\nEBITDA, and um peaked\nat over 200.\nAgain, a crazy, you would\nnever really want to be buying something\nup there, let alone, you know, 200 or even\njust below, but now we can see that\nPalantir is actually just\ntrading at roughly where it was in uh\n2021, um you know, again, a lot of\nuberance in the equity markets, but this\nwas pre-AI and pre everything that's driven\nPalantir significantly higher.\nSo just\ninteresting to note, although it was as\nlow as 50 right around uh, oh sorry, I'm\nI'm looking at I'm looking at the wrong\nthing.\nIt was as low as uh 20, 20 times\nor so.\nSo another interesting one to sort of\nwrap your head around, and uh they're not\npaying a dividend on, obviously, so we're\nnot going to see that, but basically that\nbrings me to the conclusion here of\nthis video, and what I'm thinking is,\nlet's let's just have a look at the\nmarket cap, which is always interesting\nto see.\nWe can put it in a five-year, let's\nput it in a five-year view, and we could\nsee this is where Palantir peaked in uh in\n2021, collapsed, and has now ripped higher.\nSo when you look at it from a market cap\nbasis, Palantir is significantly higher than\nit once was because of the dilution from\nextra shares makes the market cap higher\nand dilutes shareholders.\nThe previous\nall-time high was 63 billion, and now\nit's 168 billion.\nSo that's almost a\nthree times higher market cap despite\nthe not the stock not being three times\nhigher.\nSo super interesting.\nI'd love to\nknow what all of you think.\nI think Palantir\nis going to have an incredible 2025 and\nreally grow into this valuation.\nLove to\nhear your thoughts until next time.\n",
