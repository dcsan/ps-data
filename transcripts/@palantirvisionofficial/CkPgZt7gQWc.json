  "cleanText": "Welcome back.\nToday I'm going to be reacting to this letter addressed to Palantir CEO Alex Karp from Congress of the United States.\nThis came out a couple of weeks ago and I'm going to be reacting to it for the first time.\nI just want to show you the length.\nIt's a few pages here.\nIt has some demands of Palantir CEO.\nThis is signed by some notable members of Congress like AOC, Elizabeth Warren from as a senator and some other names here you may recognize.\nSo I want to get into it and really analyze what is Palantir getting tied up in here.\nI will give you fair warning.\nIt is very much a political attack against the Trump administration and Palantir is tied up in it.\nBut I want to go through and really read all of the finer details and figure out is Palantir at fault at all?\nWhat are the risks from here from political backlash and Palantir's involvement?\nAnd I'll give you my honest opinion about the situation.\nFigure out what is really going on here because we know there's been a lot of news with Palantir and what they're doing with the Trump administration.\nAnd in this video, we're going to be getting to the bottom of the fallout of that.\nSo the letter says, \"Dear Mr. Karp, we write to demand information regarding reports that Palantir Technologies is enabling and profiting from serious violations of federal law by the Trump administration, which is amassing troves of data on Americans to create a governmentwide searchable mega database containing the sensitive taxpayer data of American citizens.\"\nSo, I'm not going to get political and pick a side here.\nI would be fine sharing my opinion.\nUm, but it's it's not about me.\nObviously, it's about what exactly is going on here.\nUh, as I read this, you can't help but understand how politically motivated it is from one side to the other.\nUh, so this is very much an attack on the Trump administration as much it is as much as it is a critique on what Palantir is doing.\nThat's just my opinion.\nSo, let's uh let's read on here and figure out what is the concern.\nAccording to press reports, Palantir employees have reportedly been installed at the Internal Revenue Service where they are helping the agency use Palantir software to create a single searchable database of taxpayer records.\nThe sensitive taxpayer data compiled into this Palantir database will likely be shared throughout the government regardless of whether access to this information will be related to tax administration or enforcement, which is generally a violation of federal law.\nPalantir's products or services were reportedly selected for this brazenly illegal project by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\nSeveral Doge members are former Palantir employees.\nSo, you'll see Doge is getting tied into this.\nThe concern is the Trump administration and the department of government efficiency are illegally using Palantir software to do um essentially amass all of these records as they say which the critique here is that the government would not legally be able to do this on their own which is why they're using Palantir software to do it.\nThat is the concern and we're about to see what exactly they're stating against Palantir, but that's the premise here.\nI don't agree with it um because I don't think Palantir would do something that they, you know, we're breaking the law to do.\nBut uh let's see if they have any evidence for this.\nSo they say the unprecedented possibility of a searchable mega database of tax returns and other data that will potentially be shared with or accessed by other federal agencies is a surveillance nightmare that raises a host of legal concerns, not least that it will make it significantly easier easier for Donald Trump's administration to spy on and target his growing list of enemies and other Americans.\nThis potential mega database at the IRS and elsewhere also raises myriad potential violations of privacy laws designed to strictly limit those, this is important, who can access the tax records of individuals and businesses, specifically the Internal Revenue Code and the Privacy Act of 1974.\nSo, this sort of hits at for me a misunderstanding or maybe not even an understanding at all of what Palantir software even does.\nWe know Palantir has been dealing with access controls, privacy, and security since its founding many years ago.\nAnd it seems like the concern here is that Palantir has been installed by Doge and the Trump administration to do one thing and they're going to use that data elsewhere.\nWell, that's only possible with Palantir if the right permissions are in place.\nSo it seems like at least so far the government doesn't even understand how Palantir or these, you know, senators and Congress people don't even understand what Palantir does.\nYou know, if I was writing a letter to the CEO of a company against their products, I would make sure I would understand their products first.\nBut it appears they didn't make it that far.\nSo we don't need to read that background here.\nJust cut to the part um with more on Palantir here.\nSo, the IRS hiring Palantir to help it establish a mega database of government held personal data, including sensitive taxpayer data for seamless processing for a limitless number of purposes, blatantly violates the notice, transparency, and procedural requirements of the privacy act.\nOkay?\nAnd this is again all addressed to Alex Karp.\nAs you should be aware, contractors are explicitly covered by many of the privacy acts requirements.\nPalantir, including individual Palantir employees, can face civil and CRIMINAL Liability for violating the privacy act.\nSo, the way I'm reading this, the way this is, you know, sort of showing to me is essentially a scare tactic, trying to get Palantir to back away from what all the work it's doing and say, you know what, we don't want to get involved.\nWe don't want to potentially violate the law, even though it's like a politically, you know, charged statement that they even are anywhere near that.\nwant to get them to back away so that the Trump administration can't do the work that they're trying to do with the software that they can of course purchase.\nPalantir's troubling assistance to the Trump administration is not limited to its work for the IRS.\nAccording to press reports, Palantir's work for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement includes helping the administration leverage data to drive enforcement operations by producing leads for enforce law enforcement to find people to deport and keeping track of the logistics of Trump's mass deportation effort.\nSuch an opaque tool in the hands of an administration that openly violates the due process rights of immigrants is a grave threat to our constitution.\nSo just as some background here, Palantir has been working with ICE for a very long time under Biden.\nI believe certainly the previous Trump administration.\nI think Palantir has been working with ICE for a very long time.\nThey've been protested against for working with ICE.\nSo it's again sort of a misunderstanding.\nProof that they've not done enough research in writing this uh letter.\nBoundaries been working with ICE under Democrats, I believe.\nAnd it just shows how politically frustrated and and and motivated this is when you're pointing out when it's against your party when Pal is working with with uh the government uh versus when they're helping your party.\nSo, you know, Paler's been working with any administration uh in service of the administration's goals um and being being paid for doing so.\nSo, I it just it's just frustrating.\nIt's just frustrating to read this.\nFurthermore, you have bragged that Palantir enables its military customers to bring violence and death to our enemies and that your software is used by US and allied defense and intelligence agencies for functions like target selection and mission planning.\nWe are concerned that Palantir software could be used to enable domestic operations that violate Americans rights.\nOkay, I mean that's a concern, right?\nI mean if that were true, I would be I would be concerned.\nUm it's just a bridge too far.\ngoes on to say, \"Donald Trump has personally threatened to arrest the governor of California, federal federalized National Guard troops without the consent of the governor for immigration raids, deployed active duty Marines to Los Angeles against the wishes of local and state officials, condoned violence against peaceful protesters, excuse me, called the independent press the enemy of the people, and abuse the power of the federal government in unprecedented ways to punish people and institutions he dislikes.\nSeems like none of that has anything to do with Palantir, but um yeah, I I don't know how Alex Karp is reading this.\nI would be pretty frustrated, but we're nearing the end here.\nThe Trump administration has spent taxpayer dollars on Palantir software at numerous other government agencies.\nAgain, this was true under Biden as well and paid it billions of dollars to conduct similar data gathering efforts, a contract with the Department of Defense and increasing that award and Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Disease Control, and NIH as well.\nLet's jump ahead here to see the demands.\nCongress will fully investigate and hold accountable Trump administration officials that violate Americans rights as well as contractors like Palantir that profit from and enable those abuses.\nSo yeah, I don't even understand because a lot of the work Palantir does, at least initially, is for free.\nAnd what even is the problem with making a profit when they're doing, you know, I guess you would scrutinize the work that they're doing, but I I don't necessarily think that making a profit has anything to do with the outcome of the work.\nI think I would love for a company to make a profit if they're doing good work.\nAnd you can debate whether the work is good.\nI think it certainly is, but I I don't know what having a profit has anything to do with it.\nAccordingly, we request that you preserve any emails, text messages, or other records relating to Palantir's work for the Trump administration in anticipation of future litigation and congressional oversight.\nPlease also provide answers to the following questions no later than July 10th, 2025, which is going to be about a week from now.\nAlex Karp is going to have to respond.\nSo, here are the demands and the questions, and I'll give you my opinion on them.\nPlease provide a list of all current Palantir contracts with the US government.\nFor each contract, please provide the following information.\nthe dollar value of the award, the agency that awarded the contract, the name of the Palantir software or product being deployed as part of the contract, and a detailed description of the services being performed as part of the contract.\nThat's fine.\nI would I would love to have that information as well.\nLet's see.\nNumber two says, \"Has Pounder sought or received as assurances from the US government that its executives, board members, and employees will not be held responsible for violations of federal law, including the Internal Revenue Code?\"\nNow, I think, you know, I I don't know why they believe they have to ask this question, uh, but I think it's a fair question.\nI I would I would like to know that of any company.\nUm, and I would certainly certainly be upset if that were the case.\nI I would be shocked shocked if it were.\nUm I I don't think Valente is breaking the law or has, you know, a go-ahead to do so.\nUh so yeah, I think they're definitely asking this in in a political context, but I think that's fair.\nI I don't think that's a that's a you know, I I would like to have that confirm that that is not the case.\nNumber three, has Palantir provided insurance coverage or commitments to pay legal costs and fines to any of its executives, board members, or employees in connection with the company's work for the US government or any foreign government.\nNow, I'd imagine any employee that's doing their job correctly will um should they be targeted for that work they are doing, the company will step in and and be responsible.\nSo I don't really understand question three here nor do I think it is uh you know any problem for the company.\nNumber four, what services, features or assistance, if any has the Trump administ administration requested and Palantir declined to provide due to concerns related to privacy, civil liberties.\nOkay, so maybe they maybe they do know some things about Palantir given that that's what they were founded on and maybe they're just not letting on what they know or potential violations of federal, state, or international law.\nSo this question here really exposes what this is all about because they're asking Palantir to expose anything the Trump administration has asked them to do that they've declined due to them feeling that it's gone too far.\nSo it almost shows that the uh letter here is not necessarily about about you know wrongdoing on Palantir's part but more an attack against the Trump administration.\nAnd number five is Palantir aware of requirements placed on agencies and contractors by the Privacy Act of 1974.\nHave you advised the government of those requirements or offered to assist in their compliance?\nDo you believe the government is currently satisfying its requirements under the Privacy Act?\nUm, no comment there.\nI'm not not well versed enough.\nNumber six, does the company have a red line for potential violations of human rights, US law, or international law by the Trump administration that would result in Palantir terminating its services for the US government?\nMore of the same.\nAgain, less about Palantir, more about the government under uh Trump.\nAnd number seven here, how many Palantir employees have quit since January 20th, 2025, citing the company's work for the Trump administration?\nonce again showing that this is less about Palantir and more about the effect of the Trump administration on Palantir its work and what these uh members of Congress and the Senate can uh can do to um score some political points.\nSo, I'd love to hear what you think uh about this this attack.\nAnd of course it's not just this but um you know naturally Palantir is doing a lot of work uh for the government at this time like they always have but increasingly so.\nSo I want to get your thoughts and hear what you think about this letter that uh is going to require some time in terms of what Alex Karp has to do to address it by July 10th and uh more broadly what what's going on with Palantir in these turbulent times politically.\nPlease let me know what you think.\n",
