  "cleanText": "I think this is ultimately this could be a trillion dollar market cap when we look out for the next two, three, four. One of the other things that came up in my conversation was with Alex Karp is the fact that, this is how he put it, he said, \"We don't have the right jokes, the right suits, the right steak dinners. We've, we're never exactly the right people at the right time, unfortunately.\" And that's probably the biggest limit to our growth: wrong people, wrong time, but right products, sort of getting at this idea that they tend to be contrarian and that they don't have a marketing team, and yet they're growing. Um, you've called it the messy of AI, but the messy of AI does look expensive based on some valuation metrics. Is it right for a pullback here, or does it keep going? Look, I think this was a historical quarter. Um, and, and ultimately, look, the Bears, they were bearish at $10, hated it at 40, and despise it at 100, right? And I think they can see AI in spreadsheets. When we do the checks that we've done for Palantir, I think it's the next Oracle, next Salesforce. I think this is the company when it comes to the AI revolution. This is really front and center. Is what's going to be one of the huge beneficiaries here? Do they need to pull the marketing lever here? Do they need to build out that team, or is it not necessary? I think the scary thing is with no direct Salesforce and basically more inbound, this is what they've done in terms of what these types of numbers. You start to look out the next three, four, five years. I, I, I think this is ultimately this could be a trillion dollar market cap when we look out for the next two, three, four. As BR talked about, I mean, institutional has obviously been very negative on it, but as we've talked, I think many have missed the biggest historical growth names the last 20 years because they focus on valuation. That said, our next guest isn't convinced. Jeff's analyst, Brenel, joins us now. He's got an underperform rating on Palantir, did raise the price target to 60 from 28. Brent, why are you sticking with underperform on this name? Uh, kudos to Palantir on the fundamentals, uh, Sarah, but uh, in the last 20 years in software, there's no name that's ever sustained this multiple, trades over 55 times revenue. Even if growth accelerated again, this company's growing 30%. Sound like it's growing 50 to 100, they're growing 30. And if you think about uh, other stories that got to these multiples, uh, they didn't sustain and growth at some point faded, and when that happens, the multiple closes. So ultimately, it's not necessarily a call on Palantir. I think our view is run a balanced portfolio, and we like other names. You can buy Meta at 25 times earnings, not revenue, earnings, and get an amazing return and and play the AI theme through Meta. You, you can own Google at 12 times EBITDA, uh, you can own Microsoft at 25 times earnings, uh, so effectively our client base, uh, is more valuation sensitive.\nUh, I've gotten three emails from institutional investors on this name. It's owned by mainly retail, uh, in the inside as a Palantir. So, uh, yes, is there an opportunity for institutional investors to own this at some point? Is that the next catalyst for the stock? Maybe. Uh, but ultimately, I go back to right now, the names, uh, that our clients are owning are names where they can have, uh, support and valuation. Um, so I'm not against owning somebody's higher fly, uh, but again, I think it has to be a lower percentage of your portfolio because ultimately, we've seen this movie before, and it does not end well on multiples. But shouldn't we talk about why it's such a high flyer and the fundamentals of the business, which, okay, you mentioned the 30% growth. My, my question on Palantir is, is anyone else doing what they're doing in terms of the AI services they're offering primarily to the US government, which are now they're scaling across enterprise, and you heard from Alex Karp what the demand looks like?\nYeah, I mean, look, they have a unique solution from the application to the infrastructure. Uh, it is no doubt a unique story, and in that sense, the question is again, how broad is this? And again, there's a lot of vendors that have AI solutions, uh, AI infrastructure, so there's other ways to play this AI theme. It's not just Palantir. You can't listen to him and say, \"Oh, he, he's the only game in town.\" That's, that's not true. There's a lot of other games in town. So if you look at AI infrastructure, right, you've got Amazon, Microsoft, Snowflake, uh, there's, there's a number of assets you can own. Uh, yes, if you wanted to complete a Palantir-like solution, you'd effectively have to take multiple solutions and stitch them together. Uh, so we, we believe, uh, Dr. Karp on that view. Um, so we're not challenging the fundamentals. What we're trying to do is separate, uh, the fundamentals from the valuation, and again, those, those are important to do. I look, I've been burned so many times in the past by, by sticking with, \"Hey, it can keep and keep running on the multiple.\" Now, the multiple today's, you know, 55 times next year's number on revenue, not earnings, not on EBITDA, on revenues. Yeah, 55 years worth of revenues is rich, to say the least. Listen, Bren, I applaud your willingness to sort of call it out. That said, I mean, they are accelerating in terms of their growth rate, 64% now for the commercial business. Investors always like that. And I can go back to the mid to late 90s as well, you know, Yahoo, yeah, wouldn't have wanted to own it at 50 times revenues. I think it traded there, maybe even more, but Amazon, I would have, because, you know, a lot of people didn't necessarily recognize the full opportunity. Uh, you know, so just give me your sense there.\nYeah, I mean, look, we all do TAM analyses, but now that the market cap's over 200 billion, you look at a company like CrowdStrike, where half, half of their, uh, it's got half or less than half the market cap, uh, is growing mid-20s, uh, to 30%, and has, has good margins, and you don't have to pay, you can pay a fraction of the multiple. So I guess my point is, it, it's okay to own a piece of this, but my point is, uh, we think there's higher conviction stories where I sleep at night not worrying about where the multiple is at. And ultimately, everyone's painting this big TAM picture. Look, if we did this across the rest of software and anyone in AI, we like, we'd have multiples that are unsustainable for the industry. And so again, I think we saw Snowflake get to 50 times revenue, we saw DataDog get to these multiples, and those multiples ultimately corrected. They went from 50 to less than 10. And so, uh, again, I think that growth isn't going to slow in the short term, uh, but again, I think investors are acting like this is a company that's growing 50% on the top line. They're growing 30, and they guided it to 30, and maybe they can accelerate that growth this year. Uh, and so we're not disputing again the fundamentals, it's just the valuation is beyond anything we've seen, and it's basically two to three times more expensive than the next single expensive stock in software. So there's another cohort of companies, uh, like some, Sara, Snowflake, uh, you go through the list, there's a lot of great companies where investors can make good returns, uh, where you're not exposing yourself to that level of multiple. And again, I go back to David, the institutional investor community, this is, they're, they're not involved. Yep, they're not. And and effectively, this is a retail, this has been fueled by a lot of the retail side, uh, of of the house. And you can hear this, this company doesn't really talk to investors, they don't go to conferences, they don't return emails from institutional investors, but they will sit and complement the retail investor all day long. And and so I, I just, I go back to like, our client base are institutional investors. I get it, I get it, charismatic CEO, memeification to a certain extent, but it's, it's working. Brent, we'll, uh, I mean, we'll have to continue the conversation. I was wrong. He also really doesn't like short sellers and has called them drug addicts, the other class of shareholders. Thank you, Brent. 2025 could be the year where you see this application layer actually take effect and you see Corporate America begin to realize the benefits of the investments they've made on AI. Palantir seems to be very far ahead based on the earnings we just got. Does this change your thesis? Uh, look, they've had a great fundamentals. I think this is a question of valuation again. You'd have to grow five years in a row at 50%, and the stock was still trade at 15 times revenue. So it's not that we're arguing the fundamentals, uh, kudos to them and in great call by Dan on the stock. Our view is, uh, more about liking other names, and remember, 50% of the this base is retail and insiders. There's no other software company like this. It's the lowest as a question of any institutional investor because barely any institutional investors own it. And so I go back to, we've all seen what happened to Snowflake at 50 times revenue, we've all seen what happened to DataDog and others, and maybe Palantir is different. Kudos to them, and I agree with you, it's getting to the applicational era, and they're in a great spot. So I'm not sitting here attacking the fundamentals. Fundamentals are are great. Ours is largely focused on the stock and looking at what's happened to investors in the last 20 years when you chase things at 50 times revenue, it doesn't end well, and none of them have. So, okay, I think part of, part of it, we're just scarred from that, and maybe we're totally wrong, uh, on that, and so I acknowledge, uh, you know, we're wrong, but I also acknowledge, like, you got to look at the history and look at the fundamental analysis. Um, so that's kind of what we're sticking to right now.\nWell, I think, uh, that, uh, the AI movement has just begun, and you know, we've been moving, uh, away from more hardware-centric tech, uh, infrastructure and so forth towards software. Uh, Palantir, uh, is a very expensive stock, but there's nothing like it in the software space. It is, we believe, going to dominate, uh, the biggest part of the tech stack when it comes to AI, and that's the platform as a service part of the stack. Uh, so very excited, and again, if you, if you think about the AI revolution, uh, we are today, um, where we were when it came to the internet in the early to mid-90s. So again, we've just begun. Let's get more reaction on this. Third Bridge Senior analyst, Jordan Berke, joins us now with more on Palantir's quarterly results. Jordan, uh, the stock soaring here, at least initially in the after hours, but your take on this report?\nJordan, yeah, thanks for having me today. Well, you know, my first take is, if we were to look a year back, Q4 2023, that was an important quarter for that. If you look at US commercial, that's been key to their story for a while now. Of course, Palantir cut their teeth in the government segment. Their pivot to commercial has been a long time coming, and we really saw that come to a head one year ago, the US commercial revenue growth coming in at 70%. I think that was shocking to many onlookers, and they've maintained that momentum since then, perhaps not at the 70% rate, but now coming to Q4 of 2024, are they going to maintain that same type of momentum? And I think with this initial release, we see the answer is yes, they're continuing with that momentum into the next year. And to your point, just to put some numbers around that, Jordan, uh, we saw sales to the US government up 45% to 343 million, commercial revenue up 64% to $214 million. So it's still a smaller part of the business, but growing very quickly here. What do you think, what do you think the sort of, um, resting state of that is in terms of the balance in the business?\nAbsolutely, they're both, of course, very important segments of the business. The government segment will continue to be an important segment of the business, I think if anything underlined by all the recent news flow around DeepSeek, the geopolitical reasons around that, so on and so forth. But the commercial segment's interesting that when they moved into this market, they had a very services-intensive business. They've been trying to scale that down for years. This is not an easy thing to do. Many software companies try, but from what we've heard from experts, they've been very successful at doing so, and their latest innovations in that regard have been the AIP offering, which is, you could think of almost like a semantic layer to make it easier to sell this very complicated product, uh, that would be their Foundry product, as well as their boot camp sales model, which we've heard a lot about in the past. This again just being a way of identifying an AI use case and drilling down on that one use case quickly to sell quickly. And all this, the point of it is to say they've been hyperfocused on moving into the commercial market and making it easier to sell this historically very challenging product to sell in these shorter-term time frames, and it seems that we've been seeing that payoff, and now really all eyes will be on how those new lands really start to expand into those massive seven and eight figure deals that they're so well known for. Jordan, who would you consider Palantir's competition?\nIt's a great question. I think everyone might have a different answer to that. I think historically it might be hard to say they have any direct competitor. Some may have said C3 at times. I think we're seeing a newer set now, though, of AI tools, and we have, of course, the OpenAI and Anthropic of the world, which do something a little different, but they are model providers. Those providers are partnering with the hyperscalers like Microsoft, AWS, and Google to provide services and the AI technology together, and that type of enablement is similar to the same type of thing Palantir does. So I think if you were to ask Palantir, not to speak for them, I would guess they would say something to the extent of they have no direct competitor, but maybe you could combine enough things together to approximate it, but it's going to be a lot harder. And what we've heard from experts we've spoken to is that may still be the case. There may not be one direct competitor out there today. So even if all of these things are true, and there is this um, very optimistic case for the company, most of the folks who are not as positive on the stock have said it's just too expensive, that even if you are looking at the numbers that we see today that yes, are sending the stock higher, that some of this is already priced in in this huge run-up that we've seen in the shares. What would you say to that?\nYeah, it's impossible to ignore the AI hype cycle aspect to this. Um, and certainly Palantir's been front and center of that hype cycle. Now, the extent to which that's been overvalued is not something I could comment on. You know, here at Third Bridge, we try to compile as many expert insights as possible, but we, we don't actually make, uh, takes on the valuation. So while I couldn't comment on that, I would agree, of course, there is a huge hype cycle around that, trying to understand whether they are, um, benefiting from that justly, I agree is something that remains to be seen. No one really knows quite yet, but as far as execution, which is really, really what we can talk about right now, it seems from what we've seen and what we've seen today, they continue to execute best in class. Jordan, there's also questions for investors about, uh, DOGE, our new Department of government efficiency. I, I think investors have questions about whether that could actually result in cuts to US military spending, what that would mean for, for different names, different defense contractors, maybe what that would\n\n\nI mean, for Palantir, you know, I did ask Co-Alex Karp about that. He said, \"Listen, bottom line, there's going to be new ways of doing business here in America.\" He said, in his words, \"As long as you're a company that's long America, long the West, like Palantir, you're in a good spot.\" But I'm just curious, how, how you think about that? Is that, is that a risk if you're long Palantir? You should be thinking about...\n\nYeah, I mean, if we think in the 21st century, um, America's software assets and software companies are some of our really crown jewels of our economy. So to that extent, that would be a Tailwind for Palantir. Now, whether cuts might affect Cent budgets and C contracts here and there, I can't say, but if you know America's long innovation, certainly Palantir stands to benefit from that. Jordan, thank you so much. Appreciate your reaction there. Thank you.\n",
