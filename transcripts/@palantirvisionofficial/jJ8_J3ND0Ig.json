  "cleanText": "In the fall of 2020, almost five years ago at this point, I made the following prediction. Look, a few more years out, I'd been Palantir for the beginning of 2025 at a bare case of $100, target of $200, and a bull case of $300. Now, keep in mind that's five years from now. Please understand that these are arbitrary targets. I didn't run any sort of models to get here. It's just how I'm feeling about the company so far. Now, what do you... That's crazy.\n\nThis was on one of my most popular early videos on Palantir. I hope all of you made a lot of money off of this prediction, and it's even surprised me in terms of the accuracy of it. I've been waiting to make this follow-up because I try and have integrity around these things. Palantir stock passed 100, crashed below it. Now, we've regained that. So, I feel it's fair to make the victory lap video and also tell you what's happening from here. So, it's good to be back with you all. I've had some time off from making videos on Palantir and thought a lot about the future of this company as well as, you know, reflecting on everything that's gone right and the journey so far. Could not be more excited to present to you today my 2026 target for the stock, which is from the next 12 to 18 months in the upside scenario. But before we get into that, I first want to address what's happened from 2020 to 2025. Very important history and context and my insights because if we don't address this, it's not going to make sense what I say in the second half of the video.\n\nSo in 2020, Palantir IPOed, shout out to all of my day ones. IPO, obviously direct listing, interchangeable terminology with several fundamental red flags that kept many investors on the sidelines. So, as of our last fiscal year and as we are through Q1, Q2, heading into Q3 and finishing up the year in Q4, most of those worries have been measurably resolved through the consistent gap profitability first and foremost. I mean, that's just huge. We're going to be going through these one by one, but profitability is tremendous, strong free cash flow, and a much broader customer base. So, let's take a look at the matrix that I've assembled here. So, in 2020, here's what it looked like. Chronic gap losses of a billion dollars and runaway stock-based compensation. An overreliance on government, meaning more than half of the revenue came from government. And the other remaining amount, Foundry, that 40% or so, was viewed as bespoke consulting, almost very thin backlog and visibility. It was very unclear what the growth was going to look like and a fairly weak balance sheet. I wouldn't say it's the weakest balance sheet ever, but in comparison, and it's very important to say these were real and valid concerns. We overcame them as investors. We did a lot of research and what actually we were supposed to be concerned about. And it turned out none of these were deal breakers in 2020. But it's also important to say that these were real concerns. They were not, you know, FUD or made up or in any way fabricated. These were real problems that kept institutions out of the stock. But here's how it looks now. Obviously, profitability has exploded. We have these stable cash flows. SBC is now deteriorating as a percentage of revenues. Government overreliance is no longer a concern. Commercial is growing like crazy. And you know, you can no longer make the argument that it is a consulting company. Foundry has been modularized. Tough word to say. And the boot camps have really put a dent in that concern. And the, you know, cash situation and paying off the debt is also making a tremendous difference. So why does it matter? Well, you know, this is sort of self-evident. I'm not going to spend a lot of time here, but it showed that Palantir has gone through and really dismantled and debunked all of the fundamental concerns when it came to the fundamentals of the company. So, it really has been a true turnaround story. If I go back to the stock here, the Bears really did win when they drove the stock from $45 down to below $6. Like, objectively, the Bears won over that period of time. That was the first half of the company's public life. There's obviously been a second story. There's been another story to the second half of the public company's life, but you got to give it to them. They were right from that period of time. You were you were definitely out over your skis. If you're buying Palantir at $45 when you could have later bought it at a more objectively a depressed valuation, like you you got it for a steal if you were buying below six. But nevertheless, the bears were right at that period of time. We're going to be talking about this, but it was unfair to value Palantir as a software company or AI company at that point in time. Now, obviously, things have changed productization and the AIP flywheel. So, we launched AIP in April of 2023, created that turnkey skew, right? And the 5-day pilot program and is you know just I would just say days, hours, and days converts a tremendous amount of trials into paid contracts, something we've been hearing more about, and the average AIP deal size is up huge. We have the commercial land and expand, which has been an ever-increasing part of the story, commercial revenue growing 70%, the top 10 commercial clients have tripled, and operating discipline has been tremendous. The headcount flat while revenue has grown. SBC capped in the low 20s of sales and the cash operating expenses per employee are down. So across the board, incredible operating discipline and capital allocation. Zero debt. This should say on the order of 50 million in buybacks offsetting some of that stock-based compensation dilution. And you know, they're in the position to if they want to do any select tuck-in M&A and strengthen that vertical IP, although we know and what's been a obviously thesis point from the beginning has been you know internal growth in terms of product. So remains to be seen what they're going to do there. But coming to the remaining open questions, you know, these are just things that seem obviously a lot less important than they did in 2020. But governance, it's like these class F shares still give people some concern. Valuation trades 20 times forward sales or so. Macro sensitivity and AIP competition. These are just like the boilerplate things you could hear in terms of a bare thesis, but they pale in comparison when what you've seen when we looked at that prior list of what the state of Palantir in 2020 was. Not concerned about any of these.\n\nSo the bottom line before we get into 2026, Palantir has flipped almost all 2020 bare thesis, profitability, cash burn, dilution, customer concentration into validated shrinks that we've seen. And this is as a result what has happened to the stock price. This is what happens when you bet on a company with these thesis. You know, it could be any thesis, but in this case, that's what those were. And they get validated. That's what happened. We saw Palantir go from $10 past $100. I predicted it. I mean, it obviously could have gone the other way, but you know, we've been saying this. I say we as a as a Palantir investor community, we definitely called it it. We predicted it and we've seen the debate now shift from can Palantir survive, which was always a crazy question, to how big can AIP make it, which is just you know such an inspiring question when you think about it, and a lot of retail investing is about you know supporting the companies that you believe in, but at the end of the day we're here to make money, right? You know, we're retail investors, we're not activist investors, um in the sense that we're going to we're not we're not private equity investors. We're not trying to, you know, make our own change in the business. So, we're here to do both, right? Invest in a great business and in a great story that's doing good for the world. It's just what I have to say there. We've finally gotten to my favorite part of this presentation, which is the 12 to 18-month upside scenario for Palantir stock because I think this period of time is when that's going to occur. I have the context on, you know, day one, what the narrative was to now and everything in between. Palantir trades near $125 with a $300 billion market cap after rerating as an AI platform stock. So very important what I'm about to say here, the core thesis, the market has repriced the multiple, consulting to software to AI. We, we that you know if you're asking yourself how' the stock go from $10 to $100, this is why. It wasn't just one rerating, it was multiple and on a multiple basis. So you know consulting, you could say anything below $20 maybe or certainly below $10, the market was valuing Palantir as a consulting company. Anything below probably $50, the market's valuing Palantir as a software company and now it's valuing it as an AI company. A totally different, you know, totally different beast. So, the next leg requires the financials to catch up via an AIP-driven revenue surge and powerful operating leverage. So what I'm saying here is the market has increased Palantir's multiple in advance of the financials. The financials haven't caught up yet. So these are these are two ways you increase a stock price. Investors are willing to pay more for the same amount of earnings or the earning and or the earnings go up, right? We've had the first happen, which is investors are confident, but the financials haven't exploded yet, which is the second shoe to drop, right? The next leg, the next leg of this story here. I don't really hear anyone talking about this, you know, it it's it sounds it sounds obvious, but it's like you have to disambiguate what actually drives a stock to be able to understand what comes next. So the target, what is my target? $200 to $250 per share. Essentially, you know, some of what I said in that 2020 prediction, but a year delayed, right? Because you look at what happened when I made that prediction in 2020, the stock, you know, spiked and ripped, almost hit $50 per share, but then what? Then it collapsed as we know. It collapsed. It went down huge, 80%. I was not expecting that. Okay, but since then it's gone crazy, right? So, I'll give myself a little bit of a break. I did not expect the stock to fall 80%. And still, it hit the low end of my target. So, you know, I'm just glad that happened. Not not for myself, not in terms of an ego standpoint, but I do really do care that I'm giving accurate information. So, the stock fell 80%, still hit the low end of my target. I'm delaying that that high end of the target to 2026 here, which I do believe Palantir will be a 500 to 600 billion market cap, just on the order of half a trillion dollars by the end of 2026, which and this is the important part, is still just a modest valuation in in an absolute sense beside the two to three trillion dollar AI leaders and the multi-trillion generative AI TAM and who knows, we probably won't even be talking about generative AI in the future, it's you know many other forms of AI are coming. So here it is spelled out for you, the typical consulting valuation is you know probably even less than this, yeah, you you see the difference, right? Software will be much more valuable than sales then and then consulting, which is you know why we were so frustrated is like you can't label this as a consulting company and part of that was incumbent on Palantir to tell the story properly and they eventually did and then it's like what is an AI platform valued at? It's much more than software. It's like software itself doesn't have the defining characteristics of an AI native company. It just doesn't and it you know AI hypergrowth, it's like how high can the multiple go? Uh it remains to be seen, but share here are the sort of rough share price zones that I put down and again I should probably tighten up these in terms of valuation metrics, but it's just broad strokes here is in terms of what you get. So let's have a look at my assumptions, just again rough rough numbers here is probably they're not going to be exact, but 4 billion in uh in revenue to 5 billion next year, to who knows on the upside, could it be 8 billion? Sounds a little high, but but again, who knows, right? What does that look like in terms of growth on the order of 30% for a base case? Could it be north of 50% for a bull case potentially? And then similar on margins, margins have always been adjusted, at least have always been great for Palantir, free cash flow, shares outstanding diluted, you know, bull case, like this could even decline, right? I think... Do they start buying back aggressively? We'll we'll we'll have to see what happens there. But free cash flow per share, 69, nice. A dollar or, you know, even push $2. Again, I wouldn't really say that's most likely, but we have to, you know, play this out to understand the probabilities of what's going to happen here. So, here's the math. Where are we right now? Base case, you know, a dollar in in free cash flow. What do you put on that? You put 110 times multiple and you get to again roughly where we are right now. For the bull case, where do you want to see this next year? Something on the order of a buck 50 to $2 and 120 times free cash flow. You'll get that $200 to $250 price target for next year. Obviously, there's a lot of option value in terms of deals, um you know, commercially and otherwise on the government side, but that's basically where the math plays out in terms of getting to to that breaking that $200 mark, which would be a 10x for practically anyone involved in the past few years in the stock. So, you've had plenty of time to buy day one on $10 to maybe maybe you bought higher than that, but hopefully not well into the extremely overvalued territory of 2021. Looking back, right, hindsight, obviously, we can say that I certainly got caught up a little bit in that as well. And then over the preceding two years, plenty of time to buy $20 down to six. So, anyone practically anyone involved in the name potentially will have a 10x on your hands. If not 12 to 18 months from now, then soon after that. So, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the math that gets us to this $200 price target. We need to convert a lot of these boot camps obviously. And regardless of how you square the math, I think we're making great progress there. As for defense and NATO, there's a lot\n\n\nTo be said and a lot of addressable spend.\nAnd as for upsell, commercial upsell, again, there's a lot where we can increase retention on existing clients, which is always great.\nSomething Palantir has done great work with and potentially could get that going again.\nOperating leverage has been fantastic.\nI expect this to continue to do well and it's like a scarcity premium.\nIt's like Palantir is truly the only pure play in this dimension.\nTheir secure model agnostic AI platform with zero direct hyperscaler competition.\nIt's like where are you going to find this?\nAnd that partially explains the high multiple is uh if there were 100 Palantirs, it would not be trading in a triple digit free cash flow multiple.\nThat's just a fact.\nBut it happens to be the only one.\nThere is only one Palantir.\nPalantir is the next Palantir as they say.\nSo here we are the multivol framework.\nUm this is just where some of these companies have been some of these peers have been you know on the order of 100 85 75 where's Palantir going to fall they have the defense grade moat and the higher margins and yeah I think uh you certainly sounds high on a you know historical sense of what free cash flow multiple would look like but we're living in we're we're living in uh the market today, not as it was 20 years ago.\nSo you got to play the game as it is.\nYou put a multiple on a fundamental value and that's how you get a valuation.\nSo 90 to 120 times at 5 billion to 9 billion with 45% free cash flow margin that's going to be ever increasing.\nAnd Palantir still screens reasonably against premium AI software peers.\nSo, let me know if you disagree with any of these numbers.\nI mean, obviously, we can poke holes in some of them, but as we're closing off here, the risks, I always like to mention the risks because I want everyone to be aware of the risks.\nAny macro or fed or you know AI itself maybe there's some sort of issue there valuation air pockets execution if forgets how to execute does not seem likely but certainly a risk governance we can't lose the founders um yeah I I think it's very important that the founders stay at least the executive the current executives stay in their roles 's competitive response.\nSo, there's always competition.\nI'm sure everyone wants a slice of the Palantir pie.\nNo one has yet come close, though.\nSo, that's where we are today.\nSo, bottom line, I want to close off this video.\nThank you very much for watching.\nLet me know if you want to see more videos like this.\nPalantir share price already captured the narrative.\nShift to AI.\nThe next doubling rests on the numbers.\nAIP-led revenue inflection.\nWe've been talking about this for a long time, but it's finally on the horizon.\nExpanding free cash flow margins and peer level AI multiples.\nSo, hitting the bullcase operating plan that points to a $200 to $250 per share target and a half a trillion valuation by late 2026.\nDon't shoot the messenger.\nMaybe it's in early 2027, but still just a modest footprint relative to the tsunami of Gen AI value creation.\nLet me say this one more time.\nHalf a trillion dollars is nothing when it comes to the future of the stock market, particularly relating to companies benefiting from AI and of course those driving the AI revolution.\nLet me know what you think.\nIt was great making this video.\nGlad to be back.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.\n",
