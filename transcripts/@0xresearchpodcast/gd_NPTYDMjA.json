  "cleanText": "I just look at the forward environment, and they're opening up the floodgates to institutional capital for the first time. And like, even like the weird, like NFT, like buy a bunch of tokens and meet a creator things are like starting to happen. Like all these experiments that crypto people have wanted to happen are like being legalized, like the capital's allowed to travel here. And um, I don't know, very short-term oriented traders, uh, on the timeline are finding reasons to get out, which is, yeah, it's good for us.\n\nQuick shout out to today's sponsor, Algorand. We'll hear more about their AlgoKit 3.0 and how it's built to supercharge your app development on Algorand later on in the episode.\n\nNothing said on 0xResearch is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our opinions, not financial advice.  Picacio, Ryan, and our guests may hold positions in the companies, funds, or projects discussed.\n\nHey guys, welcome back to another episode of 0xResearch. Today I'm joined by my right-hand man, Picacio, and Marc Arjun. And we're waiting on Cash Flows Connor. He will be here shortly, don't worry. Um, but we're going to get into it. And before we chat on anything, Bach, uh, I want to give a quick shout out, as you know, to Permissionless. It's coming up in, I want to say what, three weeks now? June 24th through the 26th. We're already in the month of June. Uh, time is flying. 0x10 is the code for 10% off.\n\nWhat can the fans, the audience, the listeners look forward to at Permissionless? Uh, just hanging out. We're going to be hanging out. It's going to be nice. We're going to do drinks one night. We'll have a dunk tank during the actual event. Chess. There's one more thing. There are multiple things happening in the event space. It'll be fun. Um, I think if you are interested in chatting to Danny, Marc, Ryan, or any of the other Blockworks Research analysts, um, you should show up. It'll be fun. Uh, last time we crashed Felix, Fhiao, the macro guys' event. This time, I think he's going to be crashing ours. Um, so we'll also have him potentially, Quinn. I don't know if Quinn's going to be showing up to be honest with you. I don't. He blocked me. So, we'll have to see. But there he is. Um, but it should be pretty fun. So, if you are going to come to Permissionless, well, if you aren't going to come to Permissionless, you should come to Permissionless. Um, so we can hang out. It'll be a good time, a jolly good time.\n\nWelcome, Ryan. If you don't come, Bach is going to eat you. So, make sure you get your tickets. 0x10, 10% off. Link in the description. Check it out. Get some tickets. We'll see you there. Um, let's jump into it today. Ryan, great of you to join. Great of you to join us. How are we doing today, folks? I think um, you know, we talked a little bit about the markets last week on the live stream. Um, how do we feel today? It seems there's still this creeping uncertainty. People are pointing to, you know, Bitcoin Treasury and other crypto treasury companies as like, you know, it feels toppy. What do we feel about that?\n\nI um, I have something to share, although it doesn't look as good as I wanted it to. So I might—it's not a chart, so I apologize—it's just numbers. I think that's fine. Um, so this is, if you are not tracking Bitcoin flows, you can do it through this website: farsideinvestors.co.uk. Um, we had—I need to zoom in. Sorry, guys. You can also do this on the Blockworks Analytics website now. Oh, very good. Uh, we'll do that next time. Daniel Smith will just get upset with me for this episode. Um, we had 615 million net outflows on Friday. Um, and like 350 million net outflows on Thursday. So we're seeing quite heavy outflows from the ETF products. Um, surprisingly, I think the SOL ETF actually had inflows over those two days. Not huge inflows, 90 mil and 70 mil, but still like net inflows, which is—Daniel Connor. Ryan Connor is very upset about it. Daniel Connor. Um, on the other side, again, the third week I'm mentioning it, people like MicroStrategy, MicroStrategy clones keep buying uh, Bitcoin and other dog [ __ ]. Um, apparently there's stuff for XRP now. Um, there's this one in Japan called MetaPlanet that just bought today. Um, today. Yeah, sorry. MetaPlanet. Um, Sailor bought today. So, there's clearly a lot of inflow, but Westy was talking about it on our analyst call this morning. You guys were all there. Ryan, you weren't there. Um, and basically, it's like it feels really toppy because we have a lot of these clones. Um, and we also have net outflows in BTC. But also every week you look at the news and it's something positive. Um, either on the regulation side or on the market side. Like it's still good. Like inflows from MicroStrategy copycats are not particularly exciting, but there's clearly interest in crypto from institutions. So it's it's kind of in a weird spot actually. Like we're still at 105K, I think. I don't—I haven't checked charts today or yesterday. Um, so the market's up. We actually had a green day across alts as well today. I'm just like in a weird spot. I think a lot of people are in a weird spot right now. If you go in the trenches, you you might lose some, you might win some. Um, but it's like it's not as clear as it was before. Whereas like when we're really going up, everything's going up. And when we're really going down, everything's going down. Um, kind of a weird spot. That's my—that's my take. Like I don't have any edge right now, so I\n\n\nI'm just holding on to whatever spot I have. And I've closed my pers. Um, just seeing what the market gives and then based on that I'll decide. Maybe I'll cut spot below like 100k or something, but I'm not like rushing to do anything. Um, quick question: do we know, B—do you know—does anybody know if all of these like MicroStrategy clones that have announced that they're doing this are they like fully deployed, or is it like they're going to deploy, or is it partial? Do we know?\n\nMetaPlanet, for context, is similar to MicroStrategy, where they're posting the like post facto, like, \"Hey, we bought X amount at this average price.\" And actually, Sailor kind of mogged them because their announcement was like—they bought more than MicroStrategy did, but they bought at a higher price than he did, like announcing it six hours later. So he kind of mogged them, even though he usually has awful execution. Like, I think people typically comment on like, \"How did you even buy above, you know, market price for the time period?\" So I thought that was like a funny thing to point out, but the buys were very like small for MicroStrategy—like 75 million, I think, announced today. Yeah. I mean, he bought 705 BTC, which is quite small for him. Um, given that he bought in Q4 last year, Q4 2024, he bought 20 billion or something in BTC.\n\nUm, Marc, to answer your question, I don't know about BTC stuff. I know for the alts like SOL specifically, like the Solana MicroStrategy stuff, it's—it was undeployed um, last time I checked, which is like a month ago. So I don't—I feel like we would have seen if they had started deploying it. Um, but like the 100 million that they initially had was undeployed. They didn't buy any SOL, or they didn't seed it. They just seeded with capital and they were waiting for something. I need to check on this. Um, yeah, a lot of the newer ones, I think it's, you know, they've completed raises for funding and um, some have maybe started buying. Like, I think by now, Solana Strategies, January—like a couple of those ones from months back, months, weeks back have already purchased some, but I think for the most part, like when you see these announcements, it's like funding—haven't bought anything yet, or maybe they've started buying, but there's no confirmation.\n\nYeah, it makes sense because I know like Shoplink, I think we talked about this last time. There is 425 million for an ETH treasury, and I was just like, \"There's no chance you're just going to deploy all of that 425 million market buy everything at once.\" I think you want to be a little bit more strategic with it. But yeah, on markets, I think same sentiment as probably the last couple of times—things are a little bit mixed. Um, I have—Bo, I have no per positions open. Um, you know, I've just been adding cash for the past few months. I think my last big buys was on Liberation Day and just been adding to cash since. Um, you know, I'm waiting for either some blood in the market or some strong catalyst to like actually go direct like long or short directionally. But yeah, that's how I'm feeling.\n\nYeah, I—um, I think it's pretty interesting watching Crypto Twitter reason about um, entries, exits, whether or not the markets topped. Um, after the uh, after the Great Depression, like people in the United States were perpetually underallocated to financial assets until like the 80s because, you know, the—the—the um, common advice coming out of it was like, \"Never buy stocks.\" Like, \"My—our families lost all our savings. You should never own stocks, of course. They're extraordinarily risky.\" Um, I think it got a little bit of that out after 2008 as well, where people lost significant amounts of money and it took them a while to get reallocated. It wasn't until, you know, 2013, I think, after that the market really started seeing um, strong performance post-GFC. Um, and I think you're seeing the same thing happen to Crypto um, post-2022 and 2023 where you just had this brutal bear, and now anytime like Bitcoin's down 1% over the last 24 hours, and I don't know—I—I don't have a lot of traders on my timeline. I like more my information from the team on like sentiment, but I'm even seeing it where like people are calling top, and we're seeing all these vehicles and, \"Should I sell all my bags?\" And that's crazy to me. Um, like I—I just look at the forward environment, and they're opening up the floodgates to institutional capital for the first time, and like even like the weird like NFT—like, \"Buy a bunch of tokens and meet a creator\" things are like starting to happen. Like all these experiments that Crypto people have wanted to happen are like being legalized. Like the—the capital's allowed to travel here, and um, I don't know—very short-term oriented uh—uh traders uh on the timeline are finding reasons to get out, which is—yeah, it's good for us—um, but I don't see any reason to um, exit the market. To me, that's crazy.\n\nYeah, I think—I think that's a great take. The—the like opposite side of this sentiment is that you've got people like James—winning nine and 10-figure public per trades on, you know, 40x leverage. Do you guys think that that's real? No, it's not. I don't think it's real. I mean, I think it's—I think there's a larp occurring there, but either way, I think he's either dodgy or someone is funding him for some form of a reason, like, and they're just taking the opposite of whatever trade he's taking on another venue. Um, is it a Hyperliquid marketing scheme?\n\nI don't think that's the rumor on the timeline. Is it actually? I don't think so. I saw like—I mean, he's interacting with CZ now um, saying, \"Hey, I DM'd you. Can you please onboard me to Binance?\" So it's a pretty weird marketing scheme from the Hyperliquid guys. You see, CZ actually mogged him. Yeah. He said, \"This guy can't even afford one BNB to send me a message.\"\n\nCZ—CZ is so funny.

So they had that obviously, like the big talk on the timeline has been after when is like how good are transparent trades, and there's like I think a pretty obvious take that it's not great because you can get hunted. Um, so obviously, like CZ started posting about dark pools and stuff on the timeline and saying that like this is what happens in TradFi. That's why like on-chain transparency isn't great. Um, and we saw Jeff also posted a quite long post about how white transparency is good. Um, to be honest with you, I think both sides kind of make sense. Like I think objectively, like intuitively, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have all of your trades public at all times to everybody. Um, on the other hand, like transparent markets could make things more efficient. Um, one thing I will say is that like if you are—I think there's—I wrote about this three months ago for Blockworks Research—but there is one team that is building um, private execution on Hyperliquid. Uh, I keep begging people to let me get into this round. I don't know if they raised or they already have or not. I just can't. But it's called Silhouette. So, if you're like somebody who likes Hyperliquid and are interested in dark pools, I'd recommend checking them out. Um, I don't think they have a lot of documentation out yet, but it's at least something to keep track of. That's my like Hyperliquid die tribe of the day, I think. No, I have one more, but I'm saving that. I like that because, I mean, even CZ chimed in and said, you know, given recent events, I think it's a good time for someone to launch dark pool decks. So, I mean, I think it's right in line with that thought.\n\nRyan, I'm curious your talk, your take. I'm sure you've got a trade-based view here regarding uh public um transparency on trading.\n\nYes. Yeah. I think um, yeah, I think we need dark pools. Um, it's just such a common market structure, and you know, we'll do it. And I think it's like mostly OTC is where the stuff happens today, but it's mostly spot, perhaps some custom derivative stuff. Um, yeah, seems like a no-brainer. Um, you know, yeah, it's just going to come with like all the maximalism on the timeline, but in reality, like investors are just going to use it. So, I'm excited to see them. What's like the breakdown there? Like, um, you know, dark pool trades relative to like overall volume on like top stocks, for example?\n\nYeah, it's it's pretty significant. Um, I don't—I did a lot of work on dark pools in the uh 2014, 2015. Um, the numbers have have probably obviously changed. Um, no, they're really popular. Uh, they're really popular from large investors. Um, I I think I think I've seen stats that they're like 80% of total TradFi market volume, but I don't know if that's still the case. I think by definition it's hard to know because they are dark pools. Well, no, they they they have to post their volume now. I think in like 2016 there was a regulation passed at least in the United States. So I don't know for total global volume, but in the United States it was basically they have to post their volume, but they only do it at the end of every day or at the end of every week or something like that. It's pretty good. But but then there's like this—there's like another issue of what they—I think they call it cross-clearing—where if you are a desk and you know one person wants to sell and another one of your clients wants to buy, like you just cross their volume on your own books, and that's like another form of dark market or of dark volume. Um, so like when you try to incorporate that, you uh obviously the numbers are hard because you don't know that stuff, but that's a significant amount of volume as well. I wanted to bring something up. I wanted to bring two things up. One is what do you think about if we are in this like weird state of I don't know what is going on. Um, well, Ryan, you're not—you're very bullish as always. Um, do you—how are you—I guess approaching information? Like, are you looking specifically—Marc, you mentioned this—that you're looking for some form of bullish catalyst? Like what are you looking for? And if you're not getting what you're looking for, are you looking to like hedge exposure by potentially like shorting stuff?\n\nI I'm not that bearish where I'm looking to hedge anything right now. Um, the best—I mean, probably the best way to quote-unquote hedge is probably diversify. Um, it still feels very P2P. So what I'm kind of looking for now is market share shifts. So like not necessarily overall increase in volume, but like who is getting the new volume now? Like we see like the DeFi of the world on Solana, and then we see, you know, the Sui hack on Sui, and then that whole—that whole DEX landscape is changing up now as well. Um, it just—it seems like it's so diversified over there. There's like a momentum and Bluefin, and the market is kind of open up there for possibly a new winner if Sui's reputation can't um, you know, can't be undone there. Um, that's mainly what I'm looking at right now.\n\nThat makes sense. I was going to say both of the things you mentioned don't have tokens because Sui doesn't have a token. Yeah, but Bluefin does. Um, I have a question. If you are thinking of shorting things, assume you could—I mean, you could look at things in the market that have like no fundamental floor.\n\n\nThat are effectively like projects that are going to die. So perhaps you can concentrate your shorts there. And I even think it's pretty interesting, um, in the L2 space now that perhaps Ethereum is bringing activity back to its chain to some degree. You'll actually have some dead chains, like for the first time, like really dead chains where the teams just, um, where the dead chains that could be an interesting short basket to hedge because you could potentially win in both markets up. Yeah, just hedge. Like shorting in Crypto is so difficult. Well, I guess shorting everywhere is very difficult, but in Crypto it is increasing; it's more difficult I think because the market—I know we like to say that it's fundamentals—but maybe like 30, 40, 50% is fundamentals, and I think a lot of the rest of it is because the thing is that typically the—let's let's like take it from the L2—if an L2 is [__] um, and it's [__] because it's kind of scammy, then they're doing like dodgy stuff with their holders, with their token concentration, with their market makers, and what could end up happening is you just get blown out eventually.\n\nUm, it's also so news-based still that it's like I don't I don't like shorting stuff. What I have been—I do agree with you that there are going to be like a handful of assets that are just going to be perma shorts, and I think we've had this this entire cycle. Um, that's my fear to book. Yeah. Yeah, like all these outs just go to a low enough market cap where some market maker, some news, can just pump it and you just get eroded on your short. Like, go ahead. Now, generally speaking, like even even some of the non-scammy ones like the Arbitrums and Optimisms, StarkNets, like even their their tokenomics—the amount of token dilution coming out—they're like their market caps are very similar, you know, similarish to like a year, two years ago, but the actual token prices are down bad, you know? So, maybe my—maybe that could be a safer short if if you're looking at what the token unlock schedule is. Um, but but even then, I would I would still be cautious. I'm happy you mentioned token unlock schedule because I want to talk about this a bit. Um, so this is the L2's grow the pie.xyz.\n\nUm, so Tao has 1.46% of revenue, um, across the L2s. Uh, let me get you that in regular numbers. They made—this is one year. This is monthly. My bad. One sec. I can't find it. They made 125k. Um, I don't know what their valuation is. I assume it's quite high, but they have a 71% cliff unlock coming up this week. So that's like one thing that you're going to be like, \"Should I short this?\" Um, but at the same time, it's going on a Binance launch pool this week as well. So it's—or just went on a Binance launch pool.\n\nUm, so that's like one of the things that ends up happening is teams end up coordinating it. Either Binance Labs, not CV now, or I don't I can't remember what it's called now, but like the Binance Labs invested into it or it has some form of something coming up that like they try to blow you out. Um, so it's very difficult even with an unlock—even knowing that this thing is probably fundamentally not worth anything—you still have to like double, triple guess yourself. So I'm—I have like huge respects for people who can like who who are the guys on TradFi side that are like short only—is it Hindenburg? I mean, I closed down—actually, they recently shut down the offices—but they were they were the big guys. Yeah. So even the best close down eventually. Yeah. Like even if they can't make it—I don't know how—I don't know. Yeah, I agree with you, Marc. I think the—I mean, it it's clear for anyone who's like looked at these tokens and considered, um, taking trades like that, you have to go a level or two deeper than just like, \"Oh, there's an unlock coming up. Oh, it's going to get diluted.\" Like just how these events get approached. Um, but you know, if you get these—like these explicit examples where a 70% unlock happens and then the token rips 100% or something in a week, like I mean maybe that sets you up for an even better short than like prior to the event. Um, so it's something to keep in mind. Like I agree, but when I look out across some of the L2s like that maybe people were foaming at the mouth for like a year and a half, two years ago, like they already look quite beaten down. Um, I mean, you might be right, Ryan, about the perpetual, but like the lower these get and the, you know, the lower the liquidity is, like the more I would be concerned about getting eaten up by uh like a little pump squeeze. Well, well, it uh yeah, I agree. Uh, I think you want to—you have to time it. You have to be, you know, a trader to an extent. You have to, you know, sell rips and buy dips. Would be the opposite if you're shorting, right? Um um short rips and whatever. Close your position on dips. Um, but it's like I think that there's a nice pro—there's like a good template that you can follow. It's like is the—you know, from a business perspective—is the thing a going concern? Is it generating fees? Is the team launching like a second token? Right? Like is is the is the—I mean, no, clearly not. What do you mean the team is launching a second token called Secret? Well, does—I mean that token doesn't have a claim on Solana rev like SOL does, right? So it's not a second token. Yeah. Let's continue.\n\nI I I sharpened the blade on on that kind of push back already. So, you kind of stepped in [__] there. Um, no, but yeah. So, but but yeah, Solana is a going concern, but you can look at these other ones that aren't that aren't generating, and like I was just looking at one chain and they generated a few hundred bucks in revenue the other day. Like they're getting paid less than individuals, right? So, um,\n\n\nYou got to think that the team's going to be thinking of doing something else. Potentially key members are leaving.  Potentially, like you can have a LinkedIn Premium subscription and you can see the total employee count of the foundation or something like kind of rolling over, right? I think that there's ways to target some interesting—there's perhaps some ways to target some interesting shorts in the market.\n\nAre you sure?\nI am not. I did sell though.\n\nIt's a Solana research crime. They're going to beat me up after the bot. No, but I did—I um—selling into weakness. Nothing like it. I bought other stuff.\n\nI just—I don't know. I'm kind of disillusioned with Solana. I have enough that I won't cope, but I also am not sure if it's the most exciting thing for me to hold at this point. And even though we have very clearly highlighted the fundamentals of Solana as opposed to other chains, um, a lot—as Blockworks Research—and I think we were one of the earlier ones to do that, which is why we got a lot of hate for doing it. Like, we're very clear that this is overvalued compared—undervalued compared to Ethereum. Um, and we were right. I just—I didn't buy Ethereum, by the way. Um, I'm just like wondering how much of that gap is going to close because Solana is going to go up um versus Ethereum is just going to keep coming down. Um, I just think there's more exciting stuff out there that I could make more money on as opposed to Solana.\n\nHowever, I am still avoiding tokens launching—not like on Ethereum, um, etc. So, I still think that Solana will have a lot of activity. I'm just not sure if it's warranted the allocation that I had. Um, if that makes sense. I don't want to be bearish on Solana because I don't think it's going to go down. I just think there's sexier stuff out there for me to buy. I think you make a good point, Marc. Like, I mean, I can recall, you know, back to last summer, all the SOL—well, not all the SOL, all the SOL—wanted SOL to go to $3,000 or whatever and flip ETH that way. But I think, you know, people with thinking a little further ahead—I did see that sentiment of like, you know, maybe SOL won't go to $3,000 a coin in the next year, but it wouldn't be absurd to see a flipping happen in the reverse direction where, you know, the fundamentals anchor these tokens back down to realistic valuations. And if you're going—if we're looking at Rev or, you know, revenue share to token holders, then um, you know, we're on that course. We'll see kind of if that ship continues.\n\nAlgoKit 3.0 includes all the tools and open-source resources you need to unleash the power and performance of the Algorand blockchain.

I know you were pounding the table a little bit about like SOL ETFs, JitoSOL, like the relationship there. There was a post last week from Lido about Lido SOL being the first LST named in a registered SOL ETF prospectus. Like, what does this mean? Is this meaningful for SOL as an asset? Like, we knew ETFs were coming, or is this like more meaningful for Lido? Like, what's the thinking there?\n\nYeah, I don't think that I have the best view on this in the market. Um, I think that there are people like way closer to the metal that would know more. Like, for example, like I think we have—maybe I take it back—we have a good like pulse on like institutional demand for things. Um, we're—we're not an allocator obviously, so like we're not pushing the buy button as an allocator, but um, there are some people that are very bullish on a Solana ETF from—from flow—from in terms of flows um that are like saying like institutions want this asset as opposed to ETH, which was kind of a flop. Um, I don't know. I've been short every ETF like kind of intellectually like—right—like I didn't think that Bitcoin was going to get meaningful flows and it—while it—it seemed my expectation did fantastic. I was bearish on the ETH ETF and that it was right to be bearish on that thing. I—I got to be honest, I would be like over the next 12 months—like I think that the market's overestimating what the SOL ETF could do in terms of flows, but I don't know—there's smart investment managers that are saying that we're wrong on that. Um, I was going to do a report about how we thought that Lido SOL would be the most likely ETF—sorry, LST—to get an ETF. I didn't publish it because I just felt I got a lot of pushback from the team and I—I felt like kind of uncomfortable. I like—if we want to go to market on a thesis, we want to be pretty sure of it. And um, I just don't think I know enough about the inner workings of the ETFs and you know what reg—\n\n\nRegulators are going to say yes or no to what. But it does seem reasonable that the JitoSOL LST could perhaps beat, um, you know, an ETH liquid staking LST, just given the complexities around staking there and unstaking.  That like the queue for ETH makes the, um, kind of withdrawal time uncertain, and the JitoSOL team's done a fantastic job with just like connecting with people in Washington. So, um, I don't know how big it's going to be for Solana, but I think it's more important for JitoSOL, right? Like, um, if JitoSOL has, uh, opens up an avenue for TradFi flows directly into the JitoSOL SOL ETF, its dominance as an LST provider on Solana really compounds and has a structural advantage against its competition. And I think they're like 5% of total stake now. Like you could see them getting up to Lido levels of total stake if they pull that off. So it's exciting for JitoSOL. It's exciting for Solana, but way more exciting for JitoSOL.\n\nOne other thing with SOL is like I think 0.25% of the circulating supply unlocks every month, right now, which is quite high.\n\nIt seems high.\n\nEvery month. Not every day.\n\nJesus Christ. Every month. Holy [ __ ]\n\nUm, but just on the on the SEC thing, I think even bigger than this JitoSOL SOL mention in some, I can't even remember the name of the SOL ETF. Like last week the SEC put out a statement on staking in general talking about how staking activities they don't deem staking activities to be a security. Um, but then when I when the logic for why was that it failed the fourth prong of the Howey test. And just for background, the Howey test is a kind of soft test to see if something is a security: investment of money, is it a common enterprise, is an expectation of profits, and then lastly is it derived from the efforts of others? And so it failed the fourth one, derived from the efforts of others, meaning that but only self-staking, staking with a, you know, self-custodial staking with a third party or custodial staking with a qualified third party, only those are not considered, um, like a security, like which kind of because they follow the rules of the protocol. They're not doing anything extra. So there's no effort of others, right? But the fact that it, you know, it failed the fourth one, which is the effort of others, but it didn't fail the third one, a common enterprise. So they still deem it as a common enterprise, or at least it didn't fail that one, which makes me question what does that mean for liquid staking tokens now, cuz you know, like is that derived on the efforts of others? Again, I'm not a lawyer, but then we have to go into that. And then also with the JitoSOL SOL ETF, like JitoSOL is an out-of-protocol, um, you know, I don't know what they call it in Solana, sidecar, whatever, right? Um, it's not following protocol rules, which was why the SEC allowed, um, self-staking because it followed protocol rules, right? They have their own rules, right? And so I just wonder how how they're going to look at this now given that that prong wasn't clearly failed for the regular staking. Um, I'm not super bullish on it, but I mean, I hope I hope it does come out. And then the next point is remember Kraken, under the previous guidance, their staking got banned. They had a settlement with the SEC because, you know, they were giving out a specified interest. They were investing in some of the things that they own, timing not on Ethereum's timeline. So then I wonder if an ETF stakes 50%, has to choose when to unstake to pay out the cash flows, like again, is that following protocol? Like how how does how is that deemed if as following protocol rules or is that derived on the efforts of others? So just even though I think it was really great news for the industry to get staking not as a security, it kind of made me a little bit less optimistic on, um, liquid staking tokens, especially in the form of ETFs.\n\nShouldn't the incremental news from JitoSOL, um, being named in an ETF, uh, filing after this, um, after Hester Pierce's note? Shouldn't that make you incrementally bullish that an issuer felt that it would be worth their effort to move that forward?\n\nI mean, I I I control that in the document and then I saw the mention and they they're talking about they're going to do staking and then in the future if liquid staking tokens are allowed, such as [JitoSOL SOL], then this is something they would consider. I was like, \"Okay, this is just some issuer mentioning, uh, JitoSOL SOL in a document for something if it happens in the future and and that might get scrapped. I I don't know if the SEC will just, you know, make them remove that part either, you know, so it's just a filing.\" So, this is like a credited in the fine print type of situation, you know, baited into a headline type of deal.\n\nYeah. I mean, to Jesus's credit, they did say they were the first listed, uh, they didn't they didn't oversell it. They, you know, they stated what the facts were, but then then the market can take it as how they like, how they like.\n\nI would assume that issuers choose their words very carefully with an SEC-submitted document. Um, I would I would assume that there's not too much hype involved, but I don't know who is the issuer. It's not like it was BlackRock. It was like some like no-name ETF issuer, right? Yeah. Rex Osprey or Osprey. I don't know how to pronounce it. I haven't heard of them before, but yeah. Yeah, they're crypto native. They've been around for a while, but yeah, it's not like BlackRock said it, which would be more significant.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Marinade.

Terms and conditions apply. Do your own research. We can jump on if there are no other thoughts. Um, something I do want to chat about that I don't know that we've talked much about is CZ. We talked about CZ today. We didn't talk about Binance, BNB, or the BNB chain. Um, I don't know that we've really broached much conversation around the BNB chain, but we've got a great dash on the Blockworks Research site. Um, I'm going to pull something up. There's been some interesting activity there. I feel like for many years, uh, BNB, BSC, the BNB chain, I think is what it's called now. Not BSC, but, um, has been sort of like, uh, this thing that exists and is over there to us in the West, um, but doesn't really get like broached or talked about much. But they've been having some interesting activity. Uh, let me just zoom out here a little bit. But on the BNB chain, um, we can see right in—let's pull this out a little bit—we can see right around January time when the Trump token launched on Solana, there was a big uptick in meme trading activity on BNB, like a quick spike from, you know, a couple hundred million a day to just straight up into the multi-billions a day in meme trading volume. Um, part of this jump as well was, uh, CZ kind of came out publicly at that time and was like, you know, maybe I should be using, you know, things on chain. I'm going to play around with DEXs. Let's let's play around with memes. Um, some memes kind of spawned out of CZ. His dog's name, Broccoli, like became a meme. They made a—he made a—they made a test token, I think, um, that went to like a couple hundred million market cap. Um, but either way, uh, the BNB guys or the team, you know, the Binance affiliated folks and CZ have like kind of been sort of promoting the on-chain ecosystem a little bit. They've been giving shout-outs to like their launchpad for meme, um, lately from like Binance affiliated accounts, um, things like that, trying to spur more activity there. And you can see like zooming out there wasn't a lot of stuff happening for a long time and even early in 2024 when other—like when Solana was kind of having its its run of like initial fame—um, not much was really happening on the BNB chain relatively. So it's interesting that they kind of jumped in and started really focusing on this. I do want to point out that this recent activity here, this project tokens, the Polyhedra ZKJ token, uh, launched a few weeks ago and is doing, you know, billions in volume a day. I can't really explain why that is other than, you know, it's in this Binance Alpha launch pool thing and I think there's maybe a points program associated with it. But um, either way, the meme activity, the some of this project maybe wash volume activity has been kind of up and to the right a little bit as of late for the BNB chain and I and I think it's kind of going under the radar. Um, I don't know if you guys have any strong thoughts here, but like the really only other big takeaway I can make is that—Oh, actually we have it right here on DEXs for the longest time. I mean, and still now, let's do percent like PancakeSwap just kind of dominates the BNB chain. Nobody's ever really tried to step in. Uniswap got a bump here and I think this was related to that ZKJ token catching some of the volume there initially, but it seems like that has all gone to PancakeSwap since um they kind of just dominate this ecosystem and they're just chugging out, you know, billions of dollars in trading volume a day. If we go back to the number, something like, you know, seven, eight billion in total daily trading volume on the BNB chain, which is sizable I think relative to—I think if we're talking about SOL, for example—\n\nYeah, I think I mean I think it's a really interesting observation. Um, about a year ago I probably considered a BNB short because nothing was going on on the chain and then um um one of the Blockworks Research analysts at the time told me I had a mental illness if I wanted to short BNB. So I didn't put that out. Um, it's, you know, if you look at the on-chain perps to centralized perps ratio and then the on-chain spot to um spot volume ratios. They're like both up and to the right. It seems like on-chain is slowly winning against the more centralized service providers in Crypto. I don't know how long that lasts given Crypto is legal in the biggest capital market in the world now and there's regulatory clarity around the corner. But if you think that that trend is going to continue, you probably prioritize your chain as opposed to your centralized exchange. And feels like Binance is doing that, which is pretty cool. An obvious big winner from this is um is PancakeSwap, right? Um, I mean, p—I mean, past few months they've been burning either between like 10 and $40 million worth of their token each month. So like they're one of the biggest um largest revenue-generating protocols in the space. I I I can't maybe like top 10, definitely top 20, um, and you know and and returning value to token holders at least in the form of um at least in the form of burn—burning the token—and it's I mean it trades at a relatively low valuation compared to other DEXs and I always I always wonder if that's like the um Chinese versus US um like discrepancy like famously um US equities trade at a higher valuation to Chinese equities um even at the same like levels of revenue, growth assumptions and whatnot. Um, and then you know you look at other tokens similar like one—the ones that are deemed Chinese tokens—and and they have similar discounts in um in their valuation. So I always wonder if that's the case if there's a bit of uncertainty or Western bias or what or you know regulations, but you know you know PancakeSwap is has been around for a while and and actually has some strong fundamentals. Its FTV to fees…\n\n\nOr revenue is like two times for PancakeSwap, and it's the fourth-highest-earning on-chain application last month. I think it's interesting to note—I've got the chart pulled up—that they basically achieved similar trading volumes in January and February of this year as they did at their peak in 2021. Oh, actually, much more, because let's pull these off; they beat out their 2021 trading volume numbers. Um, I think largely, probably propelled by the CZ kind of push for meme trading. Uh, I think this recent month there's maybe an asterisk on that one with the ZKJ trading volume, but, uh, you know, I think with how large it was at the time, like Ethereum certainly did not return to its 2021 levels of activity. So I think this is, you know, impressive to say the least, because, um, you had a large amount of activity at that time. SafeMoon was a very large asset. There were lots of, you know, dog coins trading on BSC at the time. I don't have a strong thesis there, Marc, on what you mentioned outside of like it just feels like one of those things where, you know, in the US or, you know, in the West, like people have just been afraid to touch it or, you know, go much further than just kind of acknowledging that BNB exists. Um, I think there's like this maybe weak association of just like people don't really understand maybe the relationship between the token, the chain, the exchange. Um, and like question marks over like, you know, are they using the token internally like incentivizing certain different things? Like how does that play into BNB chain itself? Like I think there's just some question marks there that maybe people in the West, like especially if you're not using Binance products, like you just kind of have no clue. The it's opaque at the end of the day; like there's just like this veil of uncertainty over the whole thing. Um, that like the East-West divide is real, and you know, if you can't, if you don't speak the language, you don't understand the culture, you miss the idiosyncrasies, and then there's like this opaque relationship in the whole ecosystem. It becomes really hard to underwrite, you know, meaningfully participating. Um, I mean, Danny, do you still participate in the Binance ecosystem? I know that's where you got your stripes. No, that's that's why I'm, um, maybe more surprised now is that I think basically all the people that I knew alongside myself who were trading in the BSC trenches in 2021, like nobody's touching that ecosystem right now. It's I'd have to imagine it's very East-dominated now because, you know, I think people in the West are using Solana, using Hyperliquid, you know, using Coinbase, even. One thing I will say about Cake is that they actually also recently updated their tokenomics. They cut down the emissions for CAKE from 29K to 20K initially, um, and then they further reduced it to 14.5, I think. So they have emissions, um, and they retired vCAKE and the CAKE system, like the past cycles' demons that have been haunting a lot of these protocols of like vote-escrow tokens are finally being phased out—overcomplicated mumbo jumbo. Um, and I'm honestly still—I didn't know it was at 2x. Um, to be honest with you, Ryan, FTV, that seems ridiculous to me.\n\nSay that again. I didn't know it was only at a 2x P/S.\n\nYeah, 2x, um, on the trailing 180-day annualized 180 days. But to that point, Buck, um, like even that that that vote that they got rid of the VE tokens, like one address came in and voted to get rid of the VE, and, you know, he got a chunk of the vote, and everybody was like, \"Where did this massive token holder come from?\" And they had no clue. So that kind of adds to the, okay, you know, the speculation, but it, um, it kind of adds to the opacity of of of the, um, of the PancakeSwap as well. You know, this just adds it, even though I do think it was the right move overall. But yeah. Yeah, I think there's a question there too of like if you could get into CZ's head and you knew he was going to be bullish on memecoins in January, then, like, you know, you I think you have yourself an easy long there, right? Like, bet up the decks that's going to facilitate that. But you know, without knowing that, I think you would have been in the dark, and and I think the broader question here is like, you know, whatever the valuation is right now, um, you know, does that low multiple reflect uncertainty? Are they going to maintain this level of trading volume, or is it, you know, going to be another spike, and then they're, you know, they'll return back to the prior levels? I think it's good if the project owner comes in and says [__] you guys, you're wrong; we need to phase these out. Like I think at the end of the day, and that's the whole point of investing in something. No, like you can just say, \"Okay, well, I don't agree with what this guy does, so I'm not going to invest this. Like I'm going to sell it and leave.\" I don't think you should listen to everybody on what they think because people think of their own like as a business. I guess the business owner also thinks about his own bags. But I don't know. I think you need to give the person who created the company or created the chain or the protocol, whatever, a bit more say than everybody else. I think some protocols and chains have this issue where they try to let everybody have a voice. And I don't want everybody to have a voice. Like in real life, would you listen to everybody? No. It's [__] stupid. You should only listen to the people who have, like, who know the product or who have some idea of what it needs to become. Shouldn't listen to every Allison, Bob experiments in direct democracy. They don't go well.\n\nYou're telling me.\n\nWas it direct democracy though here in this case? You know, wasn't Marc just describing someone who had a massive bag influence the direction? That's kind of\n\n\nLike what we're saying is the ideal outcome.\n\nYeah. In this instance, we probably think the opacity around it stinks. Like no one knew that that person was going to come in with the bag and change the vote. But, um, you know, playing decentralized token where everyone gets a say, like we've just seen how terribly that goes for everyone involved. So, like Apple would be nothing if Steve Jobs wasn't making all the decisions, and like Berkshire Hathaway is great because Warren Buffett is at the helm, not because he asks me what I think he should do with his portfolio. That'd be so funny.\n\nThe reality is you want—Yeah. I mean, you want these things to ship, not argue on the timeline. So, it makes sense. And I think increasingly people are realizing this, but they're like kind of shifting blame. So, a lot of Solana people will say, \"Oh, like Ethereum takes ages to make decisions.\" And then Ethereum people will say, \"Oh, like Bitcoin's going to crumble under quantum stuff because they take ages to make decisions.\" At the end of the day, it's like I think we're all agreeing on the same thing. You need three to four people who are leading the organization, and then the rest of you just get to sit in your little chair in the corner and just watch what they're doing, and if you don't like it, then you can just leave.\n\nYeah, I think—I mean, I think that's fair. The, you know, people love the quantum doom posting for Bitcoin. I don't know what realistic timeline that's on, but I do think Bitcoin is a little bit separated in that. I think some of the appeal is that nothing changes, and people like that. Whereas in every—all in basically every other case, it's like we want to ship, you know, the new money-connected internet, you know, the internet computer, whatever you want to call it, but you need to ship if you want to do that.\n\nOkay, cool. Um, Boccaccio, I think you have a hard stop here. We can call it there if we want to do some just final thoughts.\n\nBlame me. Ryan also has a hard stop.\n\nRyan: Well, sorry. Ryan always has a hard stop, man. You can't—you can't get Ryan in a room for longer than 45 minutes. I got to go. I'll be free at two.\n\nI have to be here because my FreshDirect order is coming. So, I have to be here. I'm going to—\n\nWhat—what are we getting this time?\n\nI don't know. I don't order it.\n\nAll right. All right. I have a hard stop now. Um, first, before we have the hard stop, let's uh let's talk Permissionless. Couple weeks out, June 24th through the 26th, we're all going to be there. Everyone on this pod is going to be there. We're probably all going to get in the dunk tank. Marc, you're going to be there. You're flying out.\n\nWater. Hell yeah. Ryan, Cashwells, Connor is going to get in the dunk tank. And any of you Lions out there that want to dunk this small dog, come out. Do not call Ryan Connor the small dog.\n\nI'm out of here. Bye.\n\nThanks for watching, guys. We will see you next time. Peace out. Live stream on Friday. We'll see you then. Bye.\n\n[Music]\n",
