  "cleanText": "Usually what happens in crypto is that the crypto markets are crazy and make no sense, and they're completely insane. Then public markets are this kind of, they're stayed and rational and institutional and so on. I've never seen this place where crypto markets are kind of stayed and rational and reasonable, and they're kind of sitting sidelines, and public markets are just bulliant. They're insane. Like, no one understands what's going on. Nobody can explain anything. Um, so it's a weird moment, and I can't imagine it's going to persist for that long, but that's where we are right now. All of the energy is in public markets and not in crypto markets.\n\nWhat's up, guys? Just wanted to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor, Aptos. We'll hear more about how Bitcoin DeFi and Aptos is heating up later today. But for now, let's get into the episode.\n\nNothing said on 0xResearch is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our opinions, not financial advice. Boccaccio, Ryan, and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects discussed.\n\nHello.\n\nThank you for that, Felix.\n\nHello. Hello.\n\nHey, everybody.\n\nGreat. So, this is the Crypto Venture State of the Union. Um, I'm Boccaccio. I'm going to be moderating. Um, before we get started, should we do a round of intros?\n\nUh, I'm Haseeb Qureshi at Dragonfly.\n\nHi, Jordi Alexander from Seleni.\n\nMike Dudas, Sixman Ventures.\n\nFantastic. Um, to get us started, how has Crypto VC evolved over the past year, and going forward, how do you see it change?\n\nUh, I think we should have the hedge fund guy answer that first. Yeah, I'm the, I'm like the fake VC here. So, I can say, like, without feeling too bad that the state of our union is not that strong. I feel like the venture, you know, we're seeing a lot of venture funds want to get into liquid. They want to do other stuff like, oh, we can't wait for a year vesting. By the time we get it, it's, it's like wrecked. So, um, you know, we're, we're a prop fund. We run our own capital. We love doing venture bets when they make sense. We do quite a lot of them. Uh, but we don't have to do them. We don't have to deploy. So, if there's a period where, you know, the deals are not great, we'll, we'll just step aside. Um, these guys are the pros, so I'm just laring.\n\nUh, yeah, I'd say, you know, it's funny because, uh, I've gotten into a lot of Twitter arguments over the last six months defending the honor of Crypto VCs. Uh, I think a lot of people, it's weird because I've never seen a moment in markets where, um, you know, usually what happens in crypto is that the crypto markets are crazy and make no sense, and they're completely insane. Then public markets are this kind of, they're stayed and rational and institutional and so on. And I've never seen this place where crypto markets are kind of stayed and rational and reasonable, and they're kind of sitting sidelines, and public markets are just bulliant. They're insane. Like, no one understands what's going on. Nobody can explain anything. Um, so it's a weird moment, and I can't imagine it's going to persist for that long, but that's where we are right now. All of the energy is in public markets and not in crypto markets. Um, one of the things that people often forget about Crypto VCs is that we do both. So, we invest into, uh, about, you know, actually roughly on a cost basis when we invest into startups, about half of our investments are into equity, and about half of them are into tokens. Um, and so, you know, it's weird that the tokens are doing not so great, and the equities are doing kind of weirdly amazing. Um, but it's like, okay, cool. I mean, I'm, I'm, we're exposed to both. Um, I do think eventually that that energy that is, um, you know, it's kind of like, you know, when you push an air pocket in a carpet, it like moves over here. Like, at the end of the day, that energy is still there, right? And eventually, we'll find its way back to tokens when, um, when the equity markets rationalize. But it's just kind of weird that now what people are talking about is, you know, how can I get my my shitty useless shitcoin onto the stock market so people will buy it? But that's where we are right now. And, and again, I think that that will eventually resolve.\n\nYeah. So, crypto equity clearly more valuable, uh, over the last 6-12 months, uh, which has created some really interesting dynamics, right? Like a year ago, you would have thought, hey, I'm doing a deal, I'm putting a couple million, you know, if I'm Dragonfly, 20 million into something, and, uh, I'm expecting the token to be, you know, the majority of the terminal value. Uh, now it's not so clear. So, you have to look at the holistic value of an entity, try to figure out, uh, you know, basically put a value on this entity, and then it's unclear if it's, you know, the value is going to accrue to equity or token. Uh, things that have changed, that is one, public market price appreciation. Two, uh, some tokens that are now starting to have value accrual mechanisms. Hyperlid obviously being, you know, the the clearest one, and then the pressure that that puts on subsequent projects to actually push value to token holders and not just to equity. Uh, what's interesting is, um, there's a bifurcation right now. So, I think in DeFi, you're starting to see, for example, a lot more projects move value, you know, to the token. Uh, in DPIN, for example, there's a whole bunch of confusion around, okay, how do we, like, restructure? We have these real-world networks. We've made promises to people who are providing supply or purchasing demand, and how the economics work here. The transition's taking longer. So, to summarize all of that, uh, we're in a real moment of flux, uh, where I think it's a good thing, and that people realize that equity can have value. Uh, but people realize that tokens, uh, shouldn't necessarily only trade on kind of like mimetic thematic large market TAM things, but you should have line of sight to, uh, you know, some credible token value accrual. And then the follow-on question to that is, okay, well, if I'm going to invest in the token, am I confident that that value will predictably long-term recruit to the token, or is there a set of, you know, insiders who are going to be siphoning off valued equity?\n\nThat makes sense. Um, does that affect the Internet Capital Markets thesis at all, the fact that equity might be more valuable than tokens?\n\nSorry, I didn't catch the first part, the ICM thesis, Internet Capital Markets.\n\nIs that like the salon? Does anyone... Does anyone know this ICM?\n\nI don't know that. That's more of a slogan than like a token.\n\nSorry. Am I crazy? ICM.\n\nI just came from the World Series of Poker. So, I, I've been hearing about ICM all day, but it sounds like a different ICM.\n\nI don't think that's an ICM. That's a different ICM.\n\nDon't worry, that's a slogan. It's not a value cruel theory. Um, so it is for Solana. It's like, hey, if Solana is the future of international capital market, sorry, is internet capital.\n\nInternet capital. See, sorry. This is, this is not a real thing. It's not a real thing. I want a completely... Can you guys go away saying the word ICM? We have failed you. Do not use... Do not use ICM. That's not real. It's a slogan.\n\nLook, well, I, I'll say this. I remember there was a tweet recently by, I think, Andy from the rollup where he was like, \"When do you think this focus on revenue narrative is going to end?\" And all the responses to him were people laughing at him being like, \"What are you [ __ ] idiot? Like, revenue will never, like, this is it's over. There's no, there's no, we're not going back from this. Um, and I think it's, uh, in a way, it's, it's, you know, it's kind of funny to dunk on that that tweet, but I think he's actually probably right that, um, it's very normal for markets to not focus on revenue when they believe that the opportunity is really big and in the future, right? So, like, the AI companies today, or at least, you know, as of a year ago, weren't making very much revenue. Now the revenue is starting to ramp, but for a lot of these AI companies, they're still the revenue numbers are very tiny if you're not OpenAI. Um, but the market understands, like, look, that I know the revenue will come. I'm not worried about that, right? Uh, that's why all these companies that do random AI things are getting huge premia because it's like, look, I, I can see how big the opportunity is going to be. Um, right now people are flabbergasted that Circle is trading at this crazy multiple on public markets. Uh, and everybody in crypto is like, you idiots, it's supposed to be worth 6 billion. We did the math. Here's our, you know, here's our multiple matrix. Um, and what the public markets are telling you, or, you know, whatever, obviously the, the, the number there is very, very volatile, but what public markets are telling you is that we believe that there's going to be a much bigger future for Circle than what you guys see right now, and you guys are too anchored to this stablecoin crypto market, and we see a stablecoin global market which is going to expand way beyond, you know, whatever it's a trading pair on Binance. Um, now one of those two parties is going to be wrong, and we'll see in the coming years, uh, how that's going to actually play out in practice. But there will come a time when people are actually excited about onchain use cases and onchain, uh, value creation, and that's going to cause this again, this disconnect between revenue and growth potential. Right now, I think what, what the market is telling you is that we don't see growth potential on chain, and that's okay. There are times when that optimism and people, people no longer can see one or two or three steps to out on the chessboard. It's like, look, I don't think there are any more moves left. I happen not to believe that. I happen to believe there's a lot more that's going to happen on chain than what we presently see. But the market doesn't agree with me right now. And that's why, like, the, I, I think actually Andy is right. Right now, market is hyperfixated on revenue. But I think that will change if and when we see that there are more use cases and more growth potential on chain than what we're currently seeing right now.\n\nI think it's very sector by sector. So, there's some sectors where, you know, if you're not focusing on revenue, you're focusing on the hopes and dreams and the butterfly butterflies, unicorns. I think AI is so new, like AI crypto, we're still figuring out exactly what it is. So, it has that potential to just trade at some crazy multiple. Something like DeFi that we've had now for a couple cycles, I think the revenue is expected, like buybacks are expected, like what Mike said, like you're, we were seeing the pump fund, you know, token, they're going to have to do buybacks, otherwise, if it's just a meme, no one's going to buy it. That's the default. And so, some sectors like deepen, you know, I think we'll follow suit, like you'll need some actual tangible, um, like economic model to come out.\n\nYeah, so just to quickly wrap up the, uh, I do, I think even some of the best founders feel like in the very, very near term, we're tapped out on the number of people who are willing to spend money and invest money and put risk capital on chain. Okay, even the biggest institutional, uh, you know, announcements that we're seeing are not like, hey, we're going to deploy a bunch of our capital into somebody else's asset on chain. It's, hey, we're going to issue this asset, and we hope some people are interested. So, we're in this like sort of pause where we're, I think, in, uh, inventing, uh, some really interesting things to put on chain. I saw Republic today is putting a SpaceX stock. Uh, it's a really fruitful and exciting time to experiment with what can be issued. Uh, it's not clear outside, uh, it's not clear that there's demand to take the risk, uh, to put the dollars on chain. You're seeing is, uh, actually more folks putting money into, you know, the BTC ETF and the Treasury stocks and the circles, and you just sort of dabbling in the theme, uh, versus the the underlying thing that will create long-term value. I think we're going to probably have to wait a little bit of time for that to start to wash out. And you're already seeing it, right? As a lot of these folks who are issuing the Treasury thing say, \"Hey, we're registering our shares. It's pretty obvious we're going to sell over the next 6 to 12 months a significant portion of, you know, the great deal that we got in this pipe. Uh, you're going to see people, you know, start to not make money investing in these public equities that they expected to. And I think then you'll see folks really rethink what do I want exposure to on an underlying basis. Uh, but right now, onchain finance, internet capital markets just isn't the thing that's like you driving the public's imagination and incremental capital. Bitcoin DeFi is heating up on Aptos with nearly 400 million BTC assets on chain. Aptos users can now earn yield on their Bitcoin via Echo aBTC and OKX xBTC without the typical bridge risks and high fees. To explore BTC yield opportunities on Aptos, follow the link in today's show notes.\n\nAs always, investments in blockchain technology involve risk. Terms and conditions apply. Do your own research.\n\nJordi, you mentioned that you guys do both liquid and venture depending on the where the cycle is. Where do you see the returns coming, um, over the next year or two? Like, which one?\n\nUm, I mean, we have been overweight Bitcoin, just, uh, understanding that it's a time where macro matters a lot, and it's just, you know, war happens, it doesn't matter, like, it actually is better for something that you know can be outside of that whole system of war. Um, the question is, you know, as Bitcoin becomes bigger and bigger, where does the sort of beta come from? Historically, it's just always been the usual, like, Ethereum will go first, and then some other stuff. I think that's kind of changed now. The role of Ethereum is different. A lot of things are doing well on the app side now. Um, so there's going to be a lot of opportunities. We're very bullish on AI as a sector. Sure. I know Hib and I have, like, sometimes, you...\n\n\nI know, been less sure around like how much will come out of that.\nI think quite a lot will come out.\nUm, so I spend a lot of my time now, you know, listening to like all the AI kind of labs and what what's coming next and trying to figure out what what could be uh linked into crypto products and how will that.\n\nSo, you're buying Bitcoin and listening to AI podcasts?\nYes.\nGot it.\nGood recommendation.\nYou're actually going to do really well this year.\nVery normie stuff.\nI mean, look, there's unfortunately like some of the age-old stuff that even though the industry is now like quite mature in some ways, we haven't figured out the some of the basics.\nYou know, why is on-chain Internet Capital Markets not huge?\nLike one thing is, you know, we had this Bybit hack.\nIt just goes to show you that keeping money on chain, there's just like these tail cases where you think you know this thing is super safe and and but somehow they've changed the front end.\nLike there's things that still happen that um give like large institutions pause on like keeping billions of dollars and trading their stocks on chain.\nAnd then on the other side, you have these L1s where, you know, we talked about DeFi, like, you know, that's starting to figure out its its value aculous in terms of like what is the what is the value of like an L1 and and like there's people trying to talk about like economic capture and me and different things, but none of it is really concrete.\nAnd um, you know, a lot of the venture bets for the last 10 years that have, you know, PolyChain from the beginning has done this for many cycles, is just, you know, you bet on L1's and L1's always have this like hope that someone's going to come and build something on the L1 and it's going to acrue value everywhere and it still kind of works.\nI I haven't said that it is fully broken, but maybe it's not as easy as it used to be to just bet on L1's.\n\nShould we do this again?\nShould we run it back?\nI I I feel like we've already done this to death.\nI don't know if we can.\nI don't know if there's anything more to say.\nYeah, the returns are decaying, but Monad and Mega ETH, what do we think?\nYeah, there's I mean, look, like I I was I I've said this too many times.\nYou're probably all bored of me saying it, but like blockchains aren't done.\nThere's still more to do.\nLike, there's no way that in the year 2025 or in the year 2021 when Solana was first launched that it's like, yeah, that's it.\nWe figured it out.\nNo more innovation.\nWe we there's nothing more to do.\nUm, some of these things get upgraded in place.\nI mean, I was just talking to somebody about um, you know, Solana trying to go to multi-proposer and it's going to take like three years.\nYou know, it's going to be it's like so P.\nLike Solana is becoming Ethereum and obviously Solana people really don't like to hear that because they think Ethereum is the enemy, but like you you eventually grow up and become your dad.\nLike that's just the circle of life and Solana is becoming its dad and Solana people will eventually get like there will be the next generation and they'll look at Solana and be like, oh, Solana's so slow and governance is [ __ ] broken and nobody can get anything done.\nIt's so political and everyone's already gotten rich.\nAll that [ __ ] it will it will just happen again and again until eventually it stops and we will all retire.\nYeah.\nSo, I would say we've so if you had asked me even when we were on stage a few months ago, uh, we had never in the history of six ventures invested in, you know, base layer chain private in private markets and and we have since since that time.\nUh, so our our I don't know if it's a thesis, but like the things that interest us is well one, you just look and the returns in investing in uh infrastructure have been really good and what we've noticed is uh a move towards sort of apps launching first or use cases launching and then chains later, right?\nAthena and, you know, a bunch of others, um, Hyperlid.\nSo we invest in plasma, you know, I like to call it Tether's blockchain.\nI mean, that's a thesis.\nI'm not overthinking it, uh, but a really good UIUX and economics around issuing, moving, uh, and interacting with stable coins.\nAnd then uh, we like to do the barbell thing at six investors.\nWe invested in Doge OS.\nI love memes.\nYou know, we're investors in pump.\nI uh worked on launching Bonk.\nUh Doge OS is uh L2 on top of Doge.\nAnd it's like, hey, you know, let's use that community, that energy, the mimetic um fervor of of folks around the Doge meme and launch apps around that, you know, things speculative apps, news apps.\nUh, you can I can't even imagine that things will happen.\nSo I agree with the se, but we pro, you know, I think you're investing more in like hard tech around, you know, what's happening.\n\nIs yours soft tech?\nWhat is your tech?\nUh, mine it's not bar chain, please.\nUm, but it's more around L1's that have sort of app specific and community specific use cases or L2s.\nSorry, I just throw I L1 L2.\nSo if you if you're building soft tech, you know where to go.\nI actually like that.\nI might start using it.\nUm, Mike, with regard to the stable coin chains and the RWA chains, what do you think they need to be able to succeed?\nYeah.\nSo, uh, well, I mean, it's a really broad question, but, uh, so I think on a very basic level, it's crystal clear that stable stable coins, uh, are a 10x, you know, better product than, for example, you know, holding a balance.\nLike I worked at Venmo 12, 13 years ago and you kind of had this like Venmo balance and it was held within one siloed app and then like hey maybe they do integration with some merchant and oh I could spend you know my Venmo bucks there.\nUh stable coins just completely reinvent that, right?\nUh so they're a better product and that they're open, composable, permissionless.\nWell, in some cases there are some permissionless ones.\nObviously there are some like USDC and USDT that aren't.\nUh but you have your choice of what type of table you use.\nThey run in open networks.\nUm, they're very cheap and so that primitive is is better for example than you know you just look at banks where like I have to the banks have to face each other for my money to move between them.\nYou know, if they're moving internationally, there might be multi-steps.\nThere's a lot of latent capital that has to sit for you know my money to move from the US to Pakistan.\nPeople have to keep reserves.\nIt's very inefficient.\nYou can solve some of those things with stable coin over time.\nWe haven't solved them today.\nI won't say that we have, but we have a promise to do that.\nThe networks are 10x better.\nUh, the product itself, as I said, is 10x better.\nIt's not, you know, Venmo bucks.\nIt's open bucks that anybody recognizes anywhere.\nUh, and it can, you know, generate yield that like and it's extremely and hyper competitive and easy for the next, you know, incremental person to issue a stable coin.\nUh, and therefore, uh, it sort of pushes people to give the benefits to the end customer, whether it's a business or a consumer.\nUm, and you know, there's sort of settlement that's much faster.\nBut the point is this stuff only works if we can create an economy where like people want to keep their money in the very long term in stable coins and there's things to do with them.\nAnd that's starting to happen.\nUh, because at the exit points, uh, they're not as relevant today, but like you can use a card to exit from stable coin in the local market that you're in.\nUh, and we're going to get better products than just cards.\nYou know, there's in Pakistan, there's people in every individual market you could think of that are creating better off-ramp products and it's going to happen much, much, much faster than you would think.\nThe next thing is machines are starting to transact at an ever, you know, faster rate.\nMachines can transact in stable coin.\nIt's really difficult for them to transact in fiat.\nYou know, there's fees on every transaction.\nThere's a million reasons why it's more difficult.\nSo stable coins are going to go from 100, what is it, 250 billion issuance to many trillions, like literally in the next 24 months.\nIt's going to blow people's mind.\nUm, it's not going to acrue as much value to Circle as people think.\nThat's going to acrue value to a whole host of other applications in aggregate, I believe, um, around them and it's going to acrue value to the end user and it's going to lift up a number of businesses from operating, you know, not for example, in dollar denominated, not having access to, you know, uh, if I had to wait 120 days to, you know, settle my trade or, you know, settle my invoice or settle my wholesale bill, I'll be able to do that, you know, maybe in one quarter of the time.\nUh, sorry, I'm all over the place with the answer, but the point is I could keep going for probably another 30 minutes and give you a bunch of reasons why they are a fundamentally better product.\nNetflix versus Blockbuster.\nIt's this is a Netflix moment for money.\nBuy circle.\nThat's basically summary.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nJoe Mckam would agree with you.\nWith nearly 400 million BTC on chain, supported by a secure, fast, and affordable move VM environment, Aptos has become the BTC growth chain.\nAptos users can now earn yield on their Bitcoin via ECOS's aBTC and OKX's xBTC without the typical bridge risks and high fees.\nWith support from Echo, OKX, and Stax's SBTC, Aptos is the place to go for best-in-class yield on Bitcoin.\nTo explore BTC

between the questions, but what sector specifically are you guys most interested in going forward?\nMike, obviously stable coins, let's see.\nWhat about you guys?\nDid you say besides stable coins?\nYes.\nWait, I can't give a 10-minute speech about stable coins.\nYou can.\nOkay.\nUm, I think so.\nOne of the things you mentioned was uh was cards.\nThat's actually something we're looking at.\nUm, so there there if you look at crypto cards like credit cards, there's there's two kinds.\nUh, the kinds that probably people in this room maybe think of like, oh, Coinbase has like a credit card.\nUm, it's it's like not really a crypto credit card.\nIt's like a credit card like gives you rewards that are relevant to Coinbase of like, oh, we'll give you Bitcoin rewards, but it's kind of just like a different skin on like, okay, you're instead of getting, you know, airline miles or whatever, you're getting Bitcoin and, you know, hopefully Bitcoin goes up.\nUm, these are fine, but they're they're not that interesting.\nUh, what we're seeing actually a lot in emerging markets is that these crypton native cards where they're actually drawing against an onchain balance that's getting paid in real time and then settled through the stable coin processor.\nSo Bridge has one of these.\nThere's another company called Rain.\nUm, there's there's a few other companies are doing actually Marquetta, which is a, you know, kind of old school traditional um uh payments company is is also getting into this game.\nAnd this is growing like gang busters in emerging economies because you know if you if you go to a place like you know you go to Argentina or Venezuela or you go to you know Turkey uh there people will actually take a crypto payment.\nNot everywhere, but in many places they will take a crypto payment.\nUm, and usually they're using Binance Pay.\nSo Binance Pay right now is the biggest in the world.\nYou go to any emerging economy, it's mostly Binance Pay that people are using.\nAnd uh, you know, you scan a QR code, you pay somebody on Tron or whatever it is uh and you and you pay them some tether.\nUm, these credit cards like if you go to a place that's basically like not a failed state and you want to pay with your crypto, right?\nLike let's say you're in um India or you're in China or you're whatever and you have some tether and you want to pay a normal person at a normal business.\nThese crypto credit cards are the only real way you can do that end-to-end loop where you have stable coins onchain in a wallet or a fintech that you're interacting with has stable coins, but you're still connected to Visa Rails or Mastercard Rails such that you swipe a card and your onchain balance gets deducted.\nRight?\nTo me, that is the only way that I could see stable coin payments actually really going mainstream where you have your balance on chain and because of the way the crypto works, you can like instantaneously swap whatever asset you have on chain.\nSo you don't have to have Tether sitting around or circle, you know, USC sitting around.\nYou could have you know some weird exotic memecoin or whatever and as long as you can swap it instantaneously um and you know settle and and you know the company that's uh issuing this card knows that this collateral is good for it then you can do all this in real time right like my experience with a bank is that like my bank doesn't do [ __ ] for me unless I move it there or move it into a money market or go and do something smart with it.\nI have to manually go in and say, \"Oh my.\"\nSo, who's putting the capital there?\nYou are putting the capital there.\nAnd why am I doing that?\nAm I earning a yield?\nLike, why do they have all this latent capital that allows them to immediately uh you know, sort of settle?\nOh, so sorry.\nSo, the depending on how these companies work.\nUm, so for example, Rain can actually settle directly with Visa.\nOkay.\nUm, using stable coins.\nMost of these companies, my understanding is that uh they have to have some kind of capital buffer such that they can see what collateral you have and they can predict\n\n\nYour spending patterns and say, \"Okay, I need to have at least this much cash, like USD, that I can then settle with Visa in order to make these payments.\" Uh, so these are less capital-efficient versions. I think within a few years, everybody's going to be settling with Visa directly in stablecoins. And that is going to allow you to have an on-chain balance that's earning yield in real time. And the moment that you spend money, it gets deducted or swapped or whatever in order to actually spend money at a retailer or whatever it is. And this is how you connect the old world and the new world, right? What we've learned in the history of venture is that making people do a new thing just sucks. Like, it just doesn't work. No one will do it, right? So, like, okay, if you're in an absolute disaster situation like in Venezuela, then people will figure out how to use Binance Pay, but most places in the world, people will, they just won't. Merchants won't do it. Um, so by piggybacking onto old infrastructure and kind of overloading it, to me, that seems like the most plausible path.\n\nAnd the reason they're able to avoid sort of like the chargeback and credit risk is because the stablecoin is a bearer asset and they can see my balance and they have access to it.\n\nCorrect. So the chargebacks are normal because all the credit card companies...\n\nYeah, the chargebacks still happen, but uh, the chargeback happens from, you know, claw back from the merchant, and the merchant gets punished, and you know, that's the way credit cards work.\n\nSorry, that's my stablecoin speech.\n\nPerfect.\n\nYeah. I mean, um, I think Ether is doing quite well now with their card product, letting you spend your ETH. Obviously, Crypto.com had this like period where everybody wanted a Crypto.com card 'cause you're getting a bunch of uh rewards on it. I think you could spend your crypto, and now Mantle is working on something, and they bought Fiat 24, which is like a real bank in Switzerland, and you can settle there, and they're developing into something called your bank. So that's, that's just been announced, should be very cool. Um, like I said, I've been listening to the Crypto AI podcast. Um, you know, we've invested very heavily across like a lot of Crypto AI companies and just have this belief that this is a sector that over the next three, four years will continue to like flesh itself out. Um, one of the things we're seeing certainly is around uh memory and personal data. Right now, Chat GBT just gets all your history, and then, you know, at some point, that'll be a massive mode for them as they'll be able to actually do useful things for you using all that data that they know about you. Uh, but I think the element of like owning your own private data and your history of your chats is going to come into play, and history uh is something that you know, you can own through crypto ultimately. Like, there'll be some form of ownership that you can uh, you can have, and you'll still be able to have as good a product that will, 'cause I think the quality of product without having any history about yourself and just, you know, opening a new Chat GBT chat is going to be very different than, you know, I know everything from chatting with you for two years and like something much more personalized. So I think crypto is going to play a role in that. Um, some companies that we've invested in are working on that uh category.\n\nAnd you know, we look at everything all the way to like the biggest things like what is money and what is bitcoin and sort of what will be currency in a world of, you know, digital intelligence. Are going to be some kind of intelligence currency? A lot of people are thinking about this, and some are even, you know, trying to develop intelligence currencies. Um, so we remain open-minded, obviously. Like, I've always been quite skeptical that you can just devise money out of thin air and just create base money. That's something that many people have tried and failed. Um, but in this specific situation where the world might change so much from um, from a new form of intelligence, I think a new type of currency might come into play. So there's just like the broad spectrum of uh of Crypto AI that's very interesting.\n\nWhy do you think Crypto AI hasn't done as well, I guess, as people imagine it would have done over the past few years?\n\nI think it's already done too well for how much is real. Like, if you look at, you know, there's a lot of people love Bit Tensor, and it's, it's an interesting coordination mechanism, but um, you know, the work that's being done on these subnets is not necessarily um, you know, worth billions of dollars yet, let's say. Uh, and then you have things like Virtuals, which is still doing quite well. I mean, it's, it's kind of back in the billions of uh valuation, and that I would say is more of um, you know, an experimental ground where you're people are just launching different things. And um, so it's done quite well. I, I wouldn't say it's not done well. I think what maybe you're expressing is like what we're seeing across all of crypto, which is in each category, there's a lot of people building, and there's like, you know, a lot of them that fail, and a lot of them raise money. Um, it's just a little bit saturated. So, like, even stablecoins, I mean, stablecoins, maybe like there's a lot more to do, but each category you look at, you know, what people have figured out is like there's a bit of an arbitrage building in web 3 versus web 2. So you just get like a lot of builders trying to take their shot at, you know, this category, and one of them, of course, Crypto AI, and there's just been so much funding thrown out at like, you know, people trying stuff. Um, but I think that's across crypto.\n\nMakes sense. Mike Dudas, do you guys have any, what are you guys focused on in terms of Crypto AI? Is that something that's still interesting to you?\n\nYeah, so uh, so to your original question, I mean, there are successful, I mean, it just depends on what what you define Crypto AI as. Like, Worldcoin is wildly successful. I think has to date, we're not investors, but has exceeded, you know, my expectations in terms of number of people signed up, uh, market cap, and you know, it's a very specific use case, which is, you know, identity, human identity in a, you know, machine transaction and interaction world. Uh, you have things, again, I don't have exposure to it, but Grass, uh, you know, so sort of like decentralized, I mean, they, they've moved beyond the original thesis, but you know, gathering data and information uh, in a, in a distributed manner that you can't do in a centralized manner for a whole variety of reasons. You'd be blocked, this, that, the other thing. Um, and so there are a number of areas. Uh, and so like this whole category is only a couple years old, right? Like the Silicon Valley version of like foundational models is, is, you know, call it 15 years old. Um, maybe expanding a little bit, but I do think what is happening and the amount of value and and novel uh insight, honestly, should talk about this because I'm in like a Telegram group with him where he's a third of the comments and probably two-thirds of the things that I learned. Um, so I'll kick it over to him very soon. But I would say Crypto AI to me has exceeded expectations in terms of value. It's just not the stuff that people are talking about. It's not the the Virtuals platform, AI agent tokens that are useless, right? It's um, things like we're finally starting to see like with uh Plurales and a bunch of other companies, decentralized training start to actually occur in an interesting way. We talked about decentralized data gathering. We talked about um, you know, human identification verification. Uh, there are a number of use cases that uh, we have phenomenal entrepreneurs and founders who could go out and work at the Open AIs of the world but have chosen to say, \"Hey, just like people who could have gone 15 years ago or maybe 10, 12 years ago and worked at big banks or big financial institutions or hedge funds, but chose to work on Bitcoin or Ethereum, we're having that right now in AI.\" Um, but it's not the stuff people are talking about because they're not launching tokens. They're not cynical. They're actually being really well funded so they can build things over a period of two to four years. Research, do really deep research, use the money they're raising on things like compute, hiring, uh, and growing, you know, their fundamental thesis and model such they're ready to expand in a world where, uh, you know, the folks who have been at it for a decade are raising 500 million capital, you know, every six months.\n\nOkay. So I will take the counterpoint from these two gentlemen that I think Crypto AI is obviously not working, and I think anybody who's like really clearly looking at what's happening in the space is like no one's using any of these products. They're not solving any problems. Like there's a lot of founders groping in the dark trying to find something that anybody will give a [ __ ] about. And if you talk to actual AI people, they will, you will tell them, \"Hey, what Crypto AI products do you use?\" And they're like, \"What the, what are you even talking about? Get out of my face. Like, let, let me get back to my podcast.\" So, like, so let's take, let's take some of the examples that were, that were just mentioned, right? So we're talking about things like um, uh, Worldcoin, which is an identity mechanism. Uh, who here has seen anybody using Worldcoin to solve an identity problem, to do what...\n\nWhat's that?\n\nUsing it to do what?\n\nSolve an identity problem. Who has seen Worldcoin? Nobody, right? I, I can't name any. I can name a lot of people who went and got their eyeball scanned in emerging countries who got paid to do it, but uh, right now, nobody at Worldcoin would tell you, \"Yeah, Worldcoin is working, right?\" Because they, they're not stupid. They understand what it looks like to be at a startup that's doing well because they're all ex-startup people who are who had products that people actually wanted, like, right now.\n\nSo, we have a stablecoin startup that's in the sort of Worldcoin app store and is actually acquiring users because they're actually verified humans and not bots. Like...\n\nSo which app?\n\nWhat's that?\n\nWhich app?\n\nWhat's that? Off-R.\n\nOfframp.\n\nYeah. Yeah. What is Stablecoin? It's a...\n\nIt's a stablecoin banking product. Has tens of thousands of users. Tens of thousands. Yeah. But like, but Worldcoin has how, how many wallets? Millions. Tens of millions.\n\nWorldcoin has about like 10 million verified users. They're um, they're scaling like the rate at which, so it's like millions a month, right?\n\nI think what you're missing is that these, these things are not going to be useful until there's a network effect, right? Like, no one's using Facebook if it's just like...\n\nRight. Fair enough. So I'm not, I'm not arguing that that Worldcoin will never work. That, to be clear, that's not what I'm claiming. What I'm claiming is that it's not working right now, right?\n\nSomething like Pluralis is decentralized training. Um, same Jensen, there's a bunch of these that are doing decentralized training. So uh, training and where anybody can add their GPU and train a model together. Uh, right now, decentralized training is extremely expensive. It's very, very slow, and you cannot do the largest state-of-the-art models in a decentralized setting. Um, people in the regular world think it's cool. They're happy to talk about it, but like, is anyone using any of the models? Has anyone even tried any of the models that were trained in a decentralized setting? They're not, that they're not at the point where they're trying to get people to use the models. They're at the point where they're trying to actually decrease the cost 10x every...\n\nTotally, totally, totally, but these things will fundamentally never be as cheap as doing it in a centralized way. And the decentralized training people know that. They don't claim that it will. They've never claimed.\n\nRight. But using Bitcoin is not as cheap as using fiat currency. Correct.\n\nCorrect. Correct. So what they're hoping is that people will care.\n\nThey're hoping that people will care about the way in which your model is trained. So look around. Do you know anybody who cares the way in which their model is trained? Not today. Have you met such a person? Right. Okay. So, here's the... So, here's here's the fundamental issue that I have with a lot of things in Crypto AI. So, I want to be very clear what I'm saying. What I'm saying is not nobody should be building in Crypto AI. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that all these startup founders should go home and pack up their bags and whatever. I'm saying they should be very clear that their startups are not working right now. They should be, they should look that clearly in the eye and understand your startup is not working if you cannot clearly describe what problem you are solving and for whom. Okay. Um, usually what happens when somebody is right about the thesis but wrong about the timing is that they just lose. Period. Right? Almost always when you are too early to a market, you are wrong and you die and you fail. And even if you're eventually right, if you're two years too early and eventually the market that you were going after materializes, you are not going to win the market. The person who started right now, the moment that it's clear who the customer is and what you need to build for them, that person wins. You don't get to win, right? So if you're, if you're five years early on VR, if you're way too early on AI, if you're way too early on whatever, almost always you are not the winner, almost always. So this is just a universal law of startups is that startups are learning machines. That's why they exist. They can learn faster than big companies can. Even though they have fewer resources, they have fewer people, they have fewer customers, they have less distribution, but they can learn faster.\n\nSo two things I would say that the learning faster cycles are getting tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter. So it's not like 10 years ago when, you know, I, I think like what you're talking about, I don't think these companies are three years early, like they might be three months early, like the...\n\nDude, this is, this has been going on already for like two years. How are they three months early?\n\nBecause things are accelerating at the, like literally the...\n\nLike right now, they're accelerating absolutely. Like Mike Dudis is actually using like Chat GBT, you know, it's impressive, this boomer...\n\nOpen AI is accelerating. Yeah, Open AI is accelerating, but like, look, here, here's what I'm saying is that there will come a time when agents are good enough to come on chain. There will come a time when decentralized training becomes really cheap or personalized models or any of this stuff will really start working, and like you and I will use a...\n\n\nPersonalized model that's entirely so small and so efficient that it can be quantized and put on our phones.\nBut those don't exist.\nThe agents don't exist.\nLike these things are not on our phones.\nNone of this stuff exists.\nAnd until it exists, you cannot build these products yet.\nYou will build the wrong thing.\nI guarantee you, you will build the wrong thing.\nAnd once the things happen, that is when the startup learning loop can actually take place.\nBut until you have a customer, until you have a feedback mechanism, until you actually know, am I building the right thing or the wrong thing, you will build for retweets.\nThat's what most people in crypto are doing right now.\nNow I, I put something like Virtuals in a different category.\nVirtuals knows what they're doing, right?\nThey're building a meme marketplace.\nIt's memecoins.\nThey know exactly what they're doing and they're doing a great job of it.\nGood job, Virtuals.\nBut I don't put them in the same category as the other people who are really trying to build for AI when they don't understand what their customer is going to look like when it arrives.\nThat's my problem with crypto.\nI, I mean, I think, um, I'm much more patient and I think the companies we've invested in, we invested in like, you know, Prime Intellect and Eternis.\nThese guys have moved to SF.\nThey're building their teams.\nThey're getting talent from the AI labs.\nThey're interacting with the AI labs all the time.\nThey're figuring out, you know, where the puck is going to be in a year.\nI think what Mike said, like, I'm feeling it as well, like there's a hyper acceleration happening because of like how quickly this technology is progressing, and so, yeah, it is like three months, it's six months, like we're talking about, like, there will be things happening very quickly, and I would rather be in there, um, even if, you know, there's, there's not like use cases right now, although I can think of one use case.\nSo, you know, unfortunately, some people have been getting hacked and it's been through these Zoom calls and and and Google meets calls, and apparently you, one of the, uh, people that I know got hacked with, uh, I think it was like a Dragonfly fake VC call.\nIt's like an AI Dragonfly.\nI think it was like an AI Haseeb.\nLiterally me.\nYeah, I think, I think it was, it was, it was meant to be like a pitch call.\nThey, they thought they were, they were pitching to Dragonfly, you know, it was some AI.\nNow, if they had Worldcoin and they had World verified ID, I think, you know, my friend would not have, uh, gone drained.\nSo there's still hope for use cases.\nThe Worldcoin needs to verify all the crypto VCs and then we'll be safe from fishing attacks.\nIf you know, I think this is the real hib here, so we're okay.\nBut if it was digital, we wouldn't know, and Worldcoin would have solved that.\nSo we're also investors in Worldcoin, in case you missed it.\nTo your point though, I think part of it also is just how you explain what your goals are.\nAnd I think a lot of these folks are trying to project that their models, uh, and their products are being used today by world-class teams.\nAnd to your point, I don't think it's the case.\nUh, a lot of them are still research experiments that are trying to drop, for example, the cost of decentralized training, uh, by 10x every number of months.\nIf they're clear with the market about what they're doing, they could be succeeding.\nBut by saying, \"Hey, we're going to compete with centralized models, uh, you know, that narrative just doesn't ring true.\"\nAnd that's where you're, and this is the thing.\nThis is crypto.\nThe easiest person to fool is yourself, especially when you have a token and the token's going up and retail's buying into it and you're getting all this stuff about you.\nSo like, as long as you are not deluded yourself about what you're doing, if you understand, look, this is a research project, great, awesome.\nGo do research.\nI'm glad you're getting funded to do your research.\nBut if you believe your own hype, you're getting high on your own supply.\nThat is the formula for just abject failure, right?\nAnd the, the, the example I can give, uh, I think of, of, uh, that that will resonate is like, look, I, there were so many people in the early days of DeFi that, that, that we funded that were luminaries, brilliant people who broke open the field and solve fundamental problems, and Hyperliquid arrived 10 minutes ago and just ate the whole market.\nWhy?\nBecause they knew exactly who they were building for.\nThey knew the customers were already there and they could just build the right thing.\nAnd that is how almost every market in history works is that once you know exactly what to build, the, the, the person who can take the straightest line toward building the right thing wins the market.\nSo the first search engine didn't win, the first social network didn't win, the first, uh, DeFi exchange didn't win, the first PES exchange didn't win.\nUm, I think it's very likely that the first crypto AI thing isn't going to win.\nAnd the second big smart contract L1 is going to win.\nSolana.\nFair enough.\nI should have brought up AI a lot earlier.\nUm, guys, thank you so much for coming on.\nThis was fantastic.\nDo you have any parting words, but do you guys have any parting words for the audience?\nMaybe more positive AI takes.\nDamn.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nSo mine would be, be honest about who you are, what you are, what you're building.\nUh, you know, we, we talked about crypto AI and overpromising, and, uh, what we've seen a common success theme is, uh, folks were just deeply honest.\nSo, you know, I, I'll just use the canonical example, Pump.fun.\nHey, it's a token launchpad.\nIt has trended towards meme coins being launched.\nIt has tended toward human emotion around liking, enjoying trading, enjoying real time, enjoying frenetic, you know, permissionless casino gaming, gambling, and they're generating a lot of revenue.\nAnd they're continuing to do that despite people saying day in and day out, uh, this is wrong, this is extractive, we hate it, but human behavior is saying they love that.\nYou know, Hyperliquid, slightly different, but, you know, per is definitely not a market that most people are playing in and profiting in on a regular basis, but they've found product market fit with something that people love.\nUm, seek out those behaviors if you want to be successful, uh, that people love because it's increasingly clear that we're moving away from commodity, you know, blob and block space, uh, being valued at astronomical multiples, and we're moving towards, uh, you know, products that people love and and use as part of human, human DNA, and and they're willing to pay for those.\nUm, positive stuff.\nI mean, I think the capital formation game is kind of nearing its equilibrium.\nWe're seeing even like ICOs come back and Echo is kind of doing some platform now.\nSo, it's very interesting.\nIt'll start, you know, making the VCs not feel so bad having to defend themselves, cuz, you know, people will be able to, if they want to get default capital, they'll be able to access it.\nIf someone's adding value, it'll be clear.\nSo, um, you know, I'm happy that we're, we're kind of nearing that equilibrium soon.\nAnd to end on a positive note, I love you.\n[Music]\n",
