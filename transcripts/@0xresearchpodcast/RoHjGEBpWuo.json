  "cleanText": "I mean, first of all, I just want to say that, like, the revenue meta is not a meta. Like, building profitable companies is not a meta. Like, it's just kind of a meme to call it that.\n\nWhat's up, guys? Just wanted to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor, Aptos. We'll hear more about how Bitcoin, DeFi, and Aptos is heating up later today. But for now, let's get into the episode.\n\nWhat's up, guys? This is Boccaccio, the bad host, and the better host, Danny. Uh, today we have a very, very important announcement for you. We are hosting Permissionless in Brooklyn. Um, what dates? It's going to be in June, June 24th through the 26th. Very good. Um, you can use code 0x10 to buy your tickets. Uh, we're going to do lots and lots of stuff. Um, dinners, games, you'll get to meet the whole crew, the 0xResearch crew, hopefully a bunch of the Blockworks Research and other Blockworks crew, and uh, maybe a dunk tank. We're gonna have fun. Uh, whatever we can smooch off of Yano and Meo, we're going to do it. So, if you are a 0xResearch listener, make sure to use code 0x10 to buy your tickets. Danny, any parting words and we'll see you there.\n\nNothing said on 0xResearch is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our opinions, not financial advice. Boccaccio, Ryan, and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects discussed.\n\nWhat's up, guys? Welcome back to another episode of 0xResearch. Today, my guests are woefully unprepared. Cedo asks, \"What are we talking about again today?\" Um, but it's an exciting one. I, uh, you know what? Do you guys want to do an introduction and then I'll tell a funny little story about us? Um, Cedo, we can start with you since you're on my camera first.\n\nYep. I'm Cedo. Um, I do motion at Initia. Hard to describe what that is. I just mainly handle the app ecosystem, trying to help apps grow and kind of develop their different things around their marketing and uh, overall growth. Um, yeah, I've been there for like two months now. Pretty hectic, but it's fun. It's a good time. Uh, essentially, we're just trying to make a bunch of different Hyperliquids, I guess. Um, but very, like, app chain thesis centered. Hopefully, it actually works this time. Um, but yeah, that's mainly what I've been up to as of recent. And I also do Exit Liquidity, a podcast that will remain alive by the next episode we decide to do. We'll probably do some stuff now that we're based in the area we're based in. And uh, yeah, that'll be fun.\n\nVery good. Um, Ali, before we get to you, do you... I didn't know if I should introduce Exit Liquidity or not because I didn't know if you guys were still doing it. So, you are still doing it.\n\nI mean, like, if there's a good... if there's a good thing and there's, like, a good founder, we'll do an interview. Then, if we find, like, a good video that we want to make or, like, we go somewhere, we want to make a video, we'll... we'll post it for, like, liquidity. It's... it's tough to find. It's... it's just for fun. It's like a... it's like you tweet when you feel like tweeting. Like, we live stream when we feel like live stream. Like, no, like, we don't get paid for this [Â __Â ]. So, like, we... we actually actively, like, burn money for it. So, like, you know, it's... it's got to be... it's got to be, like, it's got to be fun for us. That makes sense.\n\nUm, for what it's worth, Exit Liquidity has my favorite animations for introductions. Um, like, whoever your intro guy is, you should pay him more money and burn more money on that. Um, I also really enjoyed you guys' format because it seemed like you two were genuinely just doing it because you were like, \"We have the time. Let's chat to this guy.\" Um, which I think is a better approach than a lot of other crypto podcasts, except for Blockworks crypto podcasts, which are great, but I feel like a lot of other teams are like, \"How can we do as many podcasts as we can to get into as many seed rounds as possible?\" versus that didn't really seem like the... like the aim with you guys? Um, Ollie, please introduce yourself.\n\nYeah, so, uh, I'm... I'm Ali. Uh, I do Exit Liquidity, obviously, like, once or twice a year, maybe, if we're lucky. Um, I am... my primary focus right now is I'm head of growth at Valantis, which is a DeFi protocol. We build uh, custom DeFi infrastructure, custom DEX pools, stuff like that. So, my job is basically to... to try and get people to care about DeFi again amidst the, you know, everything that's going on, which, like, apparently, we're in, like, a revenue meta now, which is a thing, somehow. So, I guess it's, like, going, you know, swinging back in my favor a little bit. Um, but yeah, we're live on the Hyperliquid. Pretty fun being on there. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Imagine you're busy, right? Surely you're busy.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's, uh... I mean, yes, for sure. There's also, like, a lot of people... I don't think Hyperliquid does a great job communicating this, but, like, it is, like, a phase rollout. So, like, the chain is not anywhere near yet complete, and it's, like, it was way shittier, like, even just, like, two, three months ago. Uh, whereas, like, a lot of people are expecting it to be, like, fully ready out of the gate. Um, so, like, it makes for... it definitely makes, like, the communication side of things a little bit more nuanced. Uh, it also, like, ties our hands with some stuff. Like, I mean, you guys have probably all heard, like, people refer to, like, \"We're waiting to pre... waiting for pre-compiles to launch to go live on this or that.\" Um, so, like, there... there is a good bit of just, like, waiting for updates involved, but, uh, I mean, beyond that, like, you know, the chain is... is complete enough to have, like, a lot of basic DeFi pieces there. So, there is, like... it's... it's busy for sure. There's a lot to get done in that regard. Just, like, building up those... those first, uh, those first pieces that, like, any chain needs.\n\nYeah, this is a conversation I've had to have with people on the Blockworks side because I think a lot of people assume that the, like, HyperVM is now what it will be in the next year, but, like, they cut block times in half maybe three weeks ago. Like you said, they just launched pre-compiles. I think, right? Are on testnet or they changed some docs around, right? I can't remember what the update was, the latest update, but, um, see, do you guys also have this thing where people assume that you're fully live and done the moment that you launched, or are you guys also doing a phase launch?\n\nYeah, I mean, the thing is, um, we launched with, like, eight appchains live at the same time alongside the L1 one. So, that, I think that in itself was a little bit weird. So, in the first couple weeks, people were learning a lot about bridging infrastructure and how that could be improved a lot. So, that's kind of, like, the biggest focus. Um, just making sure that the actual interwovenness between all the roll-ups is a lot, lot stronger. Um, and then it's also around specifically around, like, the applications, first cohort of applications. There's definitely some gems in there. Like, people really love Kamagotchi. Um, and... what... including my brother, I... I think I showed this to you already. He's built, like, free [Â __Â ] websites on it now. He loves that, like, anything else in crypto. He just loves Camagotchi for some reason.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's super interesting. There's, like, a lot of instances of that. Um, and then there's also just, like, the regular DeFi primitives that I think what they need is some iteration, some, like, uniqueness that drives people there. Um, but the normal DeFi people that understand how to kind of engage with the new ecosystem and earn properly with within DeFi primitives, that... that's definitely happening. Um, but I think I'm excited about, like, this next cohort where that uniqueness is going to be, like, a focus, kind of think about why you jump to any other chain, um, or why you jump to any other ecosystem. There has to be a unique value prop. So, I think that's kind of be... that's... that's going to be, like, the main focus as we change things within the infrastructure stack that these appchains are able to use to make that easier. Um, so, that's been the main focus for us. Is there anything that I should specifically be looking forward to? Like, do you have, like, a gem that you're like, \"Keep an eye on this,\" or do you have to be very diplomatic because of your power and your position?\n\nUm... there's one that's already been talked about a lot that I had a really good conversation with recently. Um, you probably heard of Contro and their, like, Glob. They... they took a while to... to create what they have now, but, um, they... they have this alpha out. It's like a private alpha. You're able to get in via this Telegram. Um, they just launched it a few days ago, and I was super impressed by the... the application UX. It's definitely weird to have this, like, streaming of liquidity. It's still on testnet. Um, but I'm pretty excited for... for them because they have, like, a very interesting northstar where, like, the founder, Andreas, thinks that opinions that happen online basically should be backed up by money. Um, and... and the way that we're fed opinions on social media should be a lot more unique. And so, it's that with an alternative liquidity mechanism for, uh, like, binary prediction markets. Um, and I think it could be a solution, um, that... that is, like, super unique. Um, and the UX now is, like, pretty clean, and they're going to... they're going to upgrade over the next few weeks and then get the thing live on mainnet. I think that'll be... that'll be a pretty solid gem.\n\nThat makes sense. I'll... um... I'll put them in the show notes. I have heard of them and seen them. I feel like these prediction markets are doing, um, or prediction market-related platforms are more and more popular. People love gambling. Um, the revenue meta is actually just companies making money on gambling. So, we'll see how it...\n\nThat's a good point. Bitcoin DeFi is heating up on Aptos with nearly 400 million BTC assets on chain. Aptos users can now earn yield on their Bitcoin via Echo aBTC and OKX xBTC without the typical bridge risks and high fees. To explore BTC yield opportunities on Aptos, follow the link in today's show notes. As always, investments in blockchain technology involve risk. Terms and conditions apply. Do your own research.\n\nAli, you mentioned, and Cedo, I also want your opinion on this. Um, like you guys said, the revenue meta. I mean, from what I remember, so, Ali, I know you wrote a pretty big report back in the day on options, per, etc. Um, see, though, I don't write or read. Okay. Um, no, but when I came on and when I've seen your Exit Liquidity pod, this is typically around DeFi. Um, and I feel like the past year and a half hasn't... Well, now it's getting a bit more and more, but, um, past year and a half hasn't been much about DeFi. How do you, um, like, on our side, sometimes we get bored. We're like, \"I can't [Â __Â ] write about Telegram bots again.\" Um, because that's the only thing... like, you can't write about meme coins. Maybe you can write one, but you can't write multiple times. How have you guys been spending your time? What have you been focused on apart from your jobs?\n\nUm, I think, uh... I mean, first of all, I just want to say that, like, the revenue meta is not a meta. Like, building profitable companies is not a meta. Like, it's just kind of a meme to call it that. It's pretty... it's pretty dumb that people are, uh, are, like, calling it this new thing as if, like... I don't know. It's ridiculous. Like, you guys know already. Um, in ter... like, outside of... outside of, I guess, just, like, working on Valantis, uh, I find it helps to either, like, zoom in a lot or, like, zoom out a lot. Uh, like, the middle ground, which is kind of where, like, CT keeps you of, like... you have these, like, attention cycles where, like, we'll rotate from being excited about one thing to the next week to week. Like, it just burns you out and, like, makes you kind of lose the plot, you know. Um, there are, like, there are always, like, cool teams doing stuff, and it's, like, I find that either following a handful of those who I really like a lot more closely and, like, seeing them develop, like, week over week, month over month, is a good way to kind of, like, get away from that. Zooming out is a little bit harder for me because, like, you can only be, like, big picture for so long before things start to, like, before you have to, like, be practical about stuff. Um, and it, like, it is a little bit harder with, like, all the CT noise if you spend a good bit of time on there. Um, but also, like, you know, kind of... I mean, me and Cedo, at least, got into crypto, like, because of DeFi. Like, that's why it's most of what we talk about and, like, most of what we... what we like... most of what we work on, even. Um, so, it's, like, having that reset every now and then, getting off of CT. Um, like, understanding that, like, there is, like, progress being made in a lot of key areas, and, like, you know, just, like, getting back to, like, why... why we're here in the first place is a... a more challenging way to do it, I think. But, uh, it, like, does help to kind of reset back to that every now and then amidst the fifth trading bot this year that's printing in revenue or whatever it is.\n\nYeah, that's a good part. What is... are you kind of sick and tired of the... what are you... what have you been doing over the past year since DeFi has kind of taken a back... um... back seat apart from your job?\n\nLike, what have you been trading? What have you been looking at?\n\nI'd say, like, I go... like, last year, like, this time last year, I was... I was doing what everyone was doing. I was... I was trading meme coins in, like, on Solana. I was getting wrecked, but I also, you know, caught a few things. Um, and yeah, that, like, it's the... it's the normal thing. Just go where, like, the flows are. But I...\n\n\nI think, for me specifically to DeFi, the thing that keeps me interested is, like, you know, I had, like, a finance degree, um, out of college, and I learned more about finance through, like, DeFi than I ever did throughout college. And it's this super fun element of crypto in general where you can look at it in, like, a pessimistic view where, like, people are scamming, but it's also, like, people are trying things, and then maybe those things blow up, and then if a few things blow up, you'll get something that works at the end of it. Um, and, like, like, I remember when, like, we were doing, like, a derivative season on Exit Liquidity. We were doing options and, uh, per protocols, and, and people were running, like, virtual AMMs, and those all blew up. And then throughout those learnings, you get, like, a Hyperliquid on the other side. Um, or, like, even, um, Bing Bagel, Bing Bagel pointed this out. I don't know if people know Bing Bagel, um, on Twitter, but, um, Morpho's recent announcement around their, like, fixed rate lending, uh, thing. I think that's pretty cool. And it looks like it took a lot of inspiration from, like, NFTfi lending where it was, like, peer-to-peer, um, fixed rate lending, um, on these JPEGs. And, and now it looks like they're going to be able to have something that's actually, you know, more robust for, like, a, a lot of real money and not JPEGs and, and things like that. So that's what always keeps me interested. I think, like, the unique way to kind of, like, create these DeFi primitives is always interesting. And then you have things like the holy grail of, like, under collateralized lending, right? Where, like, you see, like, Wildcat and, uh, 3J trying stuff. Like, I'm excited for those to maybe blow up, and then maybe we'll have something that's, like, tried and tested, and, yeah, you know, it'll be cool. No, that makes sense. Um, the reason that that is the holy grail is because we need as much credit in crypto as possible, right? I'm not misunderstanding it. Who attempted this? Last time we did this, it was centralized. I guess CI, and then those blow up. Did we do under collateralized last time? Goldfinch did it. Do you guys remember that? I think Maple also tried some stuff with, like, businesses. Yeah. And that blew up. Yeah. It was a, it was more, I guess, it was more similar to, like, 3J, and I don't think anyone has tried what they're doing right now. Um, but, like, Wildcat's model of, like, lending to businesses. I think, uh, Goldfinch and Maple, Maple had that whole thing where there was, like, there was, like, people who, like, took out loans for their small businesses to buy, like, motorcycles or something for, like, food delivery or whatever, and they defaulted. And it's like, what, what do we do now? Like, we have to go to, like, Argentina or wherever to go and, and, like, liquidate these bikes. It was Goldfinch, but it was literally that they took out for motorbikes in Kenya, I think, or maybe Argentina, and then they didn't pay it back. That's the thing. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know if either of you guys are, but I think Wildcat probably makes sense. Um, because you're dealing with institution, like, they're lending out the split capital, not to some guy in Argentina. Um, do either of you know how the free gain credit system works? Is it just ported from real life? They use a lot of stuff in the back end. We, we did a, the last, was it the last pod we did was with them? Yeah, it was with Wildcat and 3J, and, um, 3J guy, he actually ran the, um, lending desk at Ribbon, I think. It's cool. Yeah, I don't think they were, I mean, I don't think they were lending. It was mainly just, uh, I don't know what he did there, but I think it was mostly just, like, options strategies. I don't know if there was any, like, uh, yeah, I don't know, to be honest. But, um, yeah, they're basically, they have, like, Stripe integrations, they have some, like, ZK proof integration, um, that basically allows you to utilize, like, a Coinbase balance, um, your credit score, um, that lives offchain, and then they do, like, some type of AI analysis on your wallet, your DeFi wallet. So they're, they're optimizing for people that are DeFi farmers that have these wallets with that kind of, like, reputation built in, and they calculate, like, some type of score for, for, for them. Um, and, and determine how much they can borrow and at what rate. From what I've seen, that, like, the first few people have gotten, they're paying, like, around, like, 11%. Um, to, to borrow, which isn't great, but they're definitely getting, like, a lot more, and it's obviously under collateralized. Um, but, yeah, I think the Wildcat thing is, like, super cool. Um, I'm just curious how, like, something like that scales out. Um, right. Because you can only, like, approve and onboard so many, um, split capitals, right? Yeah. Um, I think they have plans. I'm pretty sure you can, like, pull your, I'm actually trying it right now because I remember they announced this, but I never got to try it. You can, like, pull your credit on 3J and, like, see how much you would be eligible for. I just, they gave me zero USDC. What the [Â __Â ] dude? Dude, it doesn't really, it doesn't really matter. I think that part doesn't work. Oh, it doesn't? Well, like, from what I've seen on Twitter, like, people are, are saying that most of the time they're not getting nothing unless they do, like, the full stack of, oh, I don't want to, I don't want to do, you can connect, like, your Credit Karma and, like, your banks and stuff like that. I remember that, like, when, when they were talking about on, on the podcast, like, ZKTLS was the big unlock there. Like, being able to access that information from, uh, from, like, off-chain sources without, like, being able to prove it without needing to, like, access it necessarily or something like that. Apparently, that is, like, the reason why this is possible. Yeah. I also saw someone say, uh, on, on Twitter, there's a, so, apparently, each Stripe call cost the platform, like, around, like, two bucks for Stripe to do their kind of thing. So, someone was saying they could, theor, I'm, I'm believing whatever this person is saying, but they're saying that you kind of just bankrupt three by just spam calling the, the Stripe in. No, they have, they have limited, the spots are limited. Yeah. Um, so those things are definitely still early, and I hope they don't blow up, but I think we'll see a lot of iteration on this kind of, like, under collateralized lending. And actually, have you guys not done a, you guys should do a pod with, uh, those guys. I will. I just remembered, and I put it in my notes to be honest with you. I, uh, I'm gonna try and have Lawrence on as well from Wildcat. Lawrence is hilarious. Dude, Lawrence is so funny. He's, he's a great podcast guest. Yeah. I don't know how happy he'll be that CO said, hopefully they blow up and it gets better. I didn't say hopefully they blow up. I totally said that. The thing is, he's very honest with the platform. He's like, you know, this is a riskier thing. That's why the rates are higher for lending. Like, this has the potential to, to, to blow up. You have the potential to not get your money back. He did say, like, I don't, I don't think he, I don't remember him ever using the words blow up, but he did say, like, there will come a time, there will come a time when, like, someone defaults, and, like, everybody comes to Lawrence's, like, dude, like, what do I do now? And, like, it's just going to be a night, like, a comm's nightmare. Um, but, like, I mean, I don't know, the platform is designed to, like, handle cases like that, even if, like, when it happens, like, users are definitely going to be upset initially, but over time, it's supposed to, they're supposed to be able to, like, to acquire that debt and, like, clear it off the books or something like that. I mean, people are upset if there's a default in real life as well. Like, it ruins people. So, like, there's not, there's not much that Lawrence can do on that end.

As always, investments in blockchain technology involve risk. Terms and conditions apply. Do your own research. In terms of per, have you guys tried any, Ali, this might be a little, uh, scary of a question for you, but have you guys tried out anything but Hyperliquid these days? Have you used anything but Hyperliquid these days? I've, I've tried them all, dude. Uh, well, I don't know about all of them, but, like, all there, you know, there's, like, this new wave of per decks who are all kind of just, like, trying to, like, tail this Hyperliquid, like, hype. It's like, uh, extended variational lighter Pacifica. Uh, there's, like, a couple others that I haven't tried. I think, like, Avantis and some other one. Aster, do you know that one? The ones CZ-backed or Binance. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know. That's what it was called. Yeah. Yeah. I've tried, I mean, I've tried a lot of them, but, like, I don't know. I'm not a very sophisticated trader, so I, like, I mean, I can tell that the liquidity is terrible on a lot of them. And some of them, like, I can't even really trade on, or at least, like, trade on without just getting ruined by slippage. Um, but, like, I don't know. They're all just, like, per decks with points programs. Like, it is what it is. What do you, um, we talked about VMs a bit? Um, obviously blew up. Um, did you guys always, like, in your mind, did it always make sense that a CLOB would win out, or were you ever, like, you know what, there's some, like, AMM hybrid models that might work out? The, the better question is, like, last, when GMX was out, were you like, you know what, this model probably wins eventually, or were you always caught thinking it's stupid? I never really, I never really thought about the models to determine a winner. I remember we had a guest who was, like, very against AMMs, and that's one, one of the first times that I was thinking about, like, this is an AMM, this is, like, a order book. Like, what? That was, like, kind of the first instance where I was debating that within my head. Um, I don't know. I was never really, like, a big GMX trader. I think most people were just using, or just interacting with the platform via, like, GLP, or at least the ones that I knew. Um, yeah, I never really, like, debated that within my head. Um, honestly, yeah, I don't know. It's, it took time for me to, like, develop those opinions, I think. And I, I flipped back and forth pretty often. Like, the first time I heard, the first time I heard of, like, a VMM, I didn't really understand what was wrong with it. And, like, I don't think any of them had really blown up at that point. Um, or, like, when GMX was hot, like, I didn't really understand what their model was. Um, I feel like I have a more nuanced opinion now. Uh, I mean, for purpob, right? Like, you can't, I don't think there's any way you can scale, like, AMMs as we understand them today to, like, do what Hyperliquid or, like, a CEX could do. Like, you, you just can't straight up. Uh, I have always been interested in hybrid models, though. Like, I, I always liked Vertex. I always liked Drift. Um, like, intuitively, it makes a lot of sense to me because you're able to, like, deepen the liquidity on your books a little bit while also giving users a way to, like, passively provide liquidity. Uh, they usually still get burned providing that liquidity. But, like, I don't know, people tend to oversimplify AMMs. I think there's a lot of different ways they could look that is not just, like, simple, like, XY equals K bonding curves or, like, concentrated liquidity or whatever that is able to do more, uh, and people are just too quick to write them off. Like, like, people have had a centralized, like, source of bids and asks on some asset for, like, as long as we've traded things, pretty much, like, longer than we have had computers, probably. But, like, AMMs, we've had for what, like, 10 years? Yeah. Yeah. And, like, they have been, like, they have been improving and changing in a lot of different ways, like, and they all still suck in a lot of different ways, too, but, like, just writing them off so quickly for SP, this is, like, more for spot assets. Writing them off so quickly is just, like, it just seems super shortsighted in my opinion, and it's, like, not, I think if you hold that opinion, then that is, like, an anti-DeFi opinion, like, you, like, you're kind of missing the forest for the trees with that. I think that makes sense. I feel like the general take now is for super longtail dog [Â __Â ] assets, you want to use AMMs to swap, um, or for, like, one-to-one, well, things that should be one-to-one, um, LSTs, I guess, USDC, USDT, etc. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's pretty, uh, it's a pretty common take. I think it definitely makes sense. Um, yeah. I mean, we still haven't really seen any spot order books on chain that, like, can provide good liquidity for anything under, like, it's not even just, like, [Â __Â ] assets. It's, like, under, like, 200 mil market cap stuff. Like, people, like, vastly overestimate Hyperliquid spot for everything outside of, like, hype, Bitcoin, and, like, ETH and Soul, maybe. Like, outside of that, like, you're going to want to use an AMM pretty much. Yeah, I think this is, I'm going to tie this into the Hyperliquid ecosystem thing I want to chat about, but, um, I think the go, the jerk reaction to people building AMMs on Hyper EVM is saying, but there's an order book. Why the [Â __Â ] would you do that? But clearly, that's not true because, like, you said, like, fartcoin, Soul, BTC, E, that's the unit assets, there's hype, but everything apart from that, I mean, you need to have somebody to make that market, and I don't know if everybody wants to do that. I don't know if anybody wants to do that, and spot bombs are actually still quite low on Hyperliquid. That's, like, supposed to be the next, um, I don't know how, although you're probably\n\n\nFamiliar with him, but Max was talking about this Fi Fi. I don't know how you say his last name, that, um, like I thought that HIPP3 would be the next big thing. He agreed, but he also said that, like, the spa ecosystem needs to grow quite heavily. Um, I think that makes a lot of sense. You guys are doing an AMM, right? Do you have an AMM? Yeah. Yeah. Um, we, so we have like one main design that we're working with right now for LSTs specifically. So, like you said, it's like kind of like both extremes, like either super volatile small assets or like very stable, like one-to-one stuff is where AMMs can really shine. So, we're kind of on the ladder there. Uh, the design we have right now is like a pool that is generally like for any liquid derivative. So, any asset that is staked and then can be redeemed for its base asset. Um, so that's like LSTs, like SUSD and USDE. Um, other types of stable coins that follow that model, LRTs. Um, and it's like, I mean, it's an AMM. I'm like, intuitively, I feel like we're going to have to move away from that language in the long run because there's a lot of, like, connotations around an AMM, and like what we do now is like that's the closest thing to it, but like it really doesn't, it really does a lot more than that. Like, it's much more like an extension of the LST itself. Like, it interacts directly with the staking contracts. It prices based on the stake. There's no bonding curve. It prices based on the staking contracts themselves, and it can like issue new stake and unstake to rebalance the pool. Um, so like AMM is like the easiest way to put it, and like that is what it is. Like, it is an automated market-making strategy, but, um, like, you know, we get people asking about stuff like pricing and like slippage and like what happens when the pool gets imbalanced and stuff like that, but like it's, it's a much more, like, involved market-making strategy than just like mathematically following a curve.\n\nThat makes sense. And you guys do your own frontends, or do you also work with, I know, I think you work with Stake Type, right? Like, is it only their front end, or do you have your own front end? We, we have our own front end. We have app.valantis.xyz. That's where all, that's where the only place where our current pool lives, and like it will be where all of our pools are for, like, in the future. Um, I mean, would definitely like, I'm sure see other people hosting them as well, but yeah, we, we have our own front end. Uh, Stake Type is like, they're just the asset that we built around for the first, like, iteration of this pool. Uh, we'll like do the same for other assets in the future.\n\nThat makes, I assume Kinetic is probably a big contender, right? Kinetic is, is a big contender. Yeah. Um, Kinetic, there's other stable coins. Uh, there's other LSTs that plan to go live soon, too. Kinetic's the main LST that people are looking forward to, though, it seems.\n\nYeah. I, um, every time I have Omni on the podcast, I ask him when he's going to go live, and it's been like six months in between, and I feel bad for him because he's waiting for pre-compiles, but like I have to ask him every time, and then like we're waiting.\n\nYeah, it's, uh, yeah, it's, it's kind of, it's a waiting game. Everybody's just in the pre-compiles wait room because they can't, I mean, they can't go live. They have, like, Stake Type doesn't have, like, a fully, like, trustless staking model, whereas like Khype will, um, and they can't do that without being able to send and redeem assets directly from Hyper Core, so they need pre-compiles for that.\n\nDo you think the spot, do you think the spot, uh, ecosystem on Hyperliquid progresses more by them adding more of the, like, farcoin stuff at higher value market caps? Do you think they make changes to the order, to they make changes to the spot ecosystem that that make it better to support things on the, uh, longer tail?\n\nI can give a very basic thought, and then Ali, I'm sure you know more about this, but I don't think that, uh, HLP does spot trading as far as I understand. Does it?\n\nNo.\n\nYeah. So, I feel like that would be, now I'm sure there's different risks to that because you actually have to hold the asset. I don't know how it works on the back end. They would know a lot better than me, but I feel like that's one thing just to boost up liquidity, um, on those assets. I think the unlock probably comes with, like, them bridging over more assets. But, um, as like, if Valantis launches a token, that's a lot better. Um, because you want the Hyper EVM to develop and have its own tokens, and then people are going to come in and want to trade on the spot books, like right now. Okay, FAR, Soul, Eve, BTC, great. Maybe you can put like a ENA, whatever, on there as well, but I think more people want to just buy Hyper EVM tokens, and as those come up. Um, well, the connection between, like, the AMM and the spot, like the AMMs that exist on Hyper EVM and, uh, the, the associated asset on the spot order book. So that's supposed to connect with the right compiles in a way where it's kind of like shared liquidity, or no, I think it's already connected.\n\nI, I mean, you, it's not connected, but you can, I mean, all you can do right now is like send, send assets, send spot assets to and from Hyper EVM. Um, the connection would be like when write pre-compiles go live, you can imagine a dex or an aggregator where you go there with hype, uh, you, let's say you want to buy FED, and FED is priced at $1 on an AMM on Hyper EVM, but it's priced at like 98 cents on Hyper Core. Um, the DEX would instead route that trade to Hyper Core and then send it back to you on, send your balance back to you on the Hyper EVM. So you get better price execution there than you would if you were just swapping on some decks on, on Hyperliquid. Um, that I find that to be like the most basic, like, straightforward example of fre what could do. There's, there's a lot more you can do. The best, the best, like, ex, the best heuristic I've heard for, like, what write pre-compiles are is like you are just wrapping an exchange API directly within a smart contract, and you can do anything, not anything, but like there's a, a set number of actions which pretty much cover everything without breaking composability that you can do, like, within a smart contract, and that's like not ever been possible before, obviously, like centralized.\n\nSo there's going to be like a, a really killer aggregator that's early enough and smart enough to write the best version of compiles.\n\nYeah. Yeah. There's a, I know there's a team that's working on this right now. I mean, they were planning, they were initially planning to launch like just with Hyper EVM functionality, but now they're, they're waiting for write pre-compiles. So they, like, they will be the first and, like, probably the only aggregator for a while that is Hyper EVM and Hyper Core.\n\nWho is it? Are they public?\n\nUh, no, they're not. I've, I can...\n\nIs it you guys?\n\nNo, it's not us. But I mean, we'd like, we'd like to build that for sure. Like, we just wouldn't be the first ones to do it.\n\nThat makes sense. I, um, see though, are you on Hyperliquid a lot, or did ZH ban you from other things?\n\nI'm on Hyperliquid a lot. I probably post about Hyperliquid more than I should. That's probably a thing. Um, but I'm on Hyperliquid a lot. I'd say, like, um, and I do want Ali to, uh, to flesh out this idea, but there are other ecosystems that, um, like I interact with as well. I think, like, there's actually, I, I won't, I won't touch on that now because it's, it's, uh, I feel like we need to wrap up this Hyperliquid, uh, conversation.\n\nBut, um, well, just wrap it up. You can wrap it up. I thought there was another question you wanted to ask.\n\nNo, I was going to ask about ecosystem apps, but it's fine. Let's, let's, let's do your thing. It sounds more interesting.\n\nNo, no. I, I want to see Ali, uh, rank all of the ecosystem apps within Hyper EVM as a participant.\n\nI don't know if I'm allowed to do that. Am I allowed to do that? I think so. I guess. Dude, it's funny because, like, people come to, people on the team come to me sometimes, and they're like, \"Yo, can I tweet this, or like, can I say this?\" And I'm like, I, I don't know, dude. Like, I'm not your PR guy. I, I mean, I, there's, I'm not going to rank them, but like I defin, there definitely are ones that I like am quite bullish on. Um, Felix is the easy answer. Like, everybody loves Felix, and for good reason.\n\nYeah, they're a liquidity V1 fork. Okay, but that's not why I'm like excited about them necessarily. Like, like I like liquidity. It's cool for sure, but I think in terms of all the teams on the Hyper EVM, they're the ones that are most, like, forward-thinking about leveraging Hyper Core. Um, and I think that that, I think like that's the reason to be on the Hyper EVM. Like, if you don't plan to do that as like part of your long-term road map, then like just like go to Base or something. Like, what's the point, you know? It's, it's you're really just there for the hype. No other reason. Um, no pun intended. Yeah. Uh, yeah, I like Felix. Uh, I Hyperland, I think is also, is also heading in the right direction for that stuff. Um, Hyperbeat is a good team as well.\n\nLast one I think is, like, I think probably, like, if you spend some time in the Hyper EVM, you get a sense for this, but most people don't know. Um, Laminar, I think is like probably the most, the most, I think that they will, like, edge out Hyperswap and Kitten Swap on a long enough time frame as, like, Hyper EVM's, like, general decks. Uh, they're just a lot quieter right now, and like they, they have a longer-term plan than just like, you know, launch a Uni V3 fork or an air drum fork and run points.\n\nVery diplomatic. Anything you like?\n\nUm, I like Felix because very early on they, uh, the, well, Ollie mentioned he just liked the team, and then they also, like, reached out to me, and like I just think people with that initiative are, are super, uh, cool. Um, outside of the ones he mentioned, there's another one that I'm farming. Charlie messages my main and my alt once a week. So Charlie's great. Charlie, Charlie and I worked at Panoptic. Uh, I think that was like his first... Yeah. I mean, he was still like working on Anthy back then, but I think that was his first, like, role at DeFi protocol, and we were both like writers there for, uh, that long, like six months maybe. Yeah, I, I respect the hell out of him. I agree with you, C. Anytime somebody's messaging you trying to, like, get you to use the product, I think that's like, it's just grit. I think it's good. Yeah. I don't have any other. Those are the only ones I'm really engaging with.\n\nI was also going to ask about, like, the ICM meta and all of these new, uh, ways to launch a token. I was curious what Picashio thinks about those.\n\nOh yeah. Yeah. Should I go first, or do you want to go first, though? Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Like Launchcoin and stuff is fine, but I feel like we always get everything in waves. You mentioned it's like that mid, uh, medium-term frequency, like the narrative. What the hell?\n\nMedium-term frequency thing. Um, I don't know if, like, the current ICM meta is going to, the current way of ICM makes a lot of sense. Um, I do think that, like, logically it does make sense because we're moving settlement, we're trying to move settlement to crypto rails because it's better. Um, and if more and more liquidity goes on the blockchain, um, why shouldn't, like, there's so much money in crypto, there's so much dumb money in crypto. If I'm a founder and I can get a quicker exit, um, and get more money to my product, why wouldn't I launch the equity as a token on, maybe not like using Launchcoin, but I'm sure it's something that could eventually work out. I just feel like it's a two, three-year thing and not something that is immediate. I didn't like the ICM meta for what it's worth. I didn't like the original one where it was like the Vine founder was like jelly, jelly. Um, I didn't like this last one where Pastor Knack just did, he like the entire thing was just him tweeting out. I know that it's probably still going up. Um, but I do think that there's probably something there in that the way that we issue assets and the way that capital forms, it might start moving more and more towards crypto. And then I think, um, you probably shouldn't ignore that, cuz eventually, like, nobody thought that stable coins would completely be on chain, and nobody still thinks that, but eventually it might be because it would make sense. That's my very diplomatic take, if that makes sense.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I, I think that's fair. The way, the way that I kind of think about it, I don't really like the, the term, like, ICM, just because I think that's like, I think that comes with, like, very web 2, like, SF Cabal type connotations. Um, I more so think that, like, I think the whole meta, like, is and always has been just like permissionless bootstrapping. Like, I don't, I don't think that, like, Jelly Jelly or like Cedo or who, like, Dupe or whoever, like, is necessarily like a new part of this. Like, I think it always has been with, like, Pump Fun Virtuals. Like, I mean, AI6Z was late with their launchpad, but like that was part of it, too. Like, it's always just been like, how can we form capital on chain, uh, in like the most efficient way possible so that it, like, runs the hardest, gets the most attention, and like continues to be a valuable vehicle for, like, retail to participate in. Um, and like I think that there's basically two things that matter there. And one of them is distribution. And that's why, like, Launchcoin was so exciting because we didn't really have a launchpad that had, like, unique and interesting distribution before that. Like, Pump Fund's distribution is that people come there to extract. Like, there is, there is an, like, a quote unquote underground network of people who launch tokens and corner the supply or whatever and pump stuff, you know, sometimes it's like actual, like, exchanges who, like, send stuff just to infinity. Sometimes it's people who just pump stuff to 500k and dump it. Whatever it is, it like creates volume,\n\n\nIt creates attention, and it like makes some people money, burns most people.\nUm, that is like solved distribution over there.\nAnd then like ICM comes in, or Launchcoin comes in, and they're like, \"Oh, like we have people building like actual apps now, like people who have backgrounds who have done other things in the startup world and are now working on something new or taking whatever they're working on before and attaching a token to it.\nUm, but it's not, it's just a different, like, just a different reason to get people excited.\nThe core thing of what's going on is the same.\nUm, and the second thing that matters is like mechanics.\nSo like this is where like anti-snipe stuff, like different bonding curves, different like launch pads and buyback mechanisms, whatever, that like this is where that starts to come into play.\nUm, and that's like much more interesting and digestible to me.\nSo like stuff like Doppler is really cool.\nI think stuff like Flaunch, uh, Dizzy is like in that group too.\nI'm still a little bit skeptical of them, or like Vertigo.\nUm, I know like the Phoenix guys did something with like Gavl or like IBRL, whatever it was.\nBelieve is having, like, they're launching their own anti-snipe fees, whatever it is.\nUm, but yeah, that's like the other side of the coin is like, how can we structure this?\nHow can we structure this bootstrapping process so that it like gets the hand, gets the token into the hands of the people who want it the most at the best price, like over the longest period of time?\nI thought they were.\nYeah, I, um, I don't want to be a dick to Ethereum, but I thought the whole reason that Doppler and Flaunch managed to work that out is because they just, like, on Solana, they also used to have anti-snipping thing, and then they eventually figured out how to bypass it because there was a lot of money to be made.\nAnd I'm curious if like Flaunch, Doppler, etc., if there was enough money to be made or more and more money to be made, um, they could just bypass it by figuring out another system as opposed to what it is now.\nIt's kind of might be a bit of an ignorant take though, because I'm not as familiar with Flaunch and Doppler as I understand, um, the Solana side of the auction and the snip and the sniping stuff.\nDo you think that these things just have to represent equity for any of it to actually work?\nYes.\nThat's kind of where I sit, and I feel like I should, like, everything else should be.\nBut can we do that?\nLike, is that legal?\nYeah, it is.\nI always thought that that was like the biggest no-no.\nLike, tokens can't be equity.\nWell, I think they couldn't be equity.\nI think they can be now, or like, because you can get, you can get away with, like, maybe it's not the legal definition of equity, but if Volantis launches a token and it's making a lot of money on these swaps, why do we, why do we keep using this as an example?\nWhatever, because Initia already has a token.\nOkay, let's do Initia.\nIf, if Initia launches, Initia Protocol X has a token, and it makes a lot of money, and all of that money goes to the token, as like, it's the case of Hyperliquid, right?\nLike, I'm sure there's Hyperliquid equity as well, maybe.\nI don't know.\nI don't want to get shot by Jeff and Zulian, but, um, I don't think so.\nOkay.\nHyperlink was a bad, whatever.\nI like Morpho did something like this where, like, now it's all under one token.\nThere is no equity.\nYeah.\nAnd if de facto all protocol revenue is going to the token and not the equity, then the token is the equity, because the token just needs to represent the cash flows of the product.\nLike, that's what equity is.\nUm, even if you can't legally call it equity, but it gets all the cash flows, then it just acts as equity now.\nAnd you can do that now.\nYou, like, you can do buybacks, which aren't great, but you can do just, um, fee sharing, whatever.\nThen your thing becomes equity.\nBosch.\nNo.\nYeah.\nBut it has to be, like, there are some pretty, not high-value market cap, but some pretty up there market cap coins right now that have teams that raise equity and then have, uh, have a token through this like ICM beta, and they're trying to navigate like what the balance is between the two.\nAnd my base case is that it's not going to work.\nUm, and that there's going to have to be a framework for launching these.\nAnd there's like a few people, like, I don't know if you saw these guys.\nI think it's called Metaplex or Meta.\nYeah, they're trying to do like SAFEs onchain somehow.\nUm, that could be cool.\nUh, Salutary is trying to do some like merger M&A stuff that I think could be cool as well.\nUm, just creating some like legal framework, um, that that actually works, I think, will be exciting, but there needs to be a few scams.\nPeople need to lose a bunch of money within ICM for for something nice to come out the other side.\nYeah, I, um, I agree with that.\nI also agree with your take that something needs to blow up for it to get fixed.\nLike, 100%.\nI think every year a lot of things blow up, and then we realize, \"Hey, guys, that was not it.\nWe should, we should do it.\"\nHyperunit is going to have like stocks and stuff.\nI think most people remember like doing stuff on Mirror and how that blew up.\nLike, that was pretty fun, aside from the blowing up part.\nWhat ecosystems are you messing around with as we close off, other than Hyperliquid?\nUm, this was actually, this is actually why I have people on and ask them what the [Â __Â ] are you doing on chain, because I am not doing anything on chain these days.\nUm, I talked about this last pod, which shows that Cedo doesn't listen to the pod, which is fine.\nUm, I listened to the one with Omni and and Max and uh, Monk, I think it was.\nYeah.\nCan you give me your feedback on that right now?\nRight now.\nIn my head.\nUm, I think you should just lean into more clips.\nI think you're, you're, you're funny, and I, I love the clips that you, you post and the memes that people post about you.\nUm, I think just lean into more clips and don't have people on that are not going to put their face cam or at least put in the effort to, uh, to, uh, have like a 3D figure.\nYeah.\nTo be fair, I also.\nYeah.\nYou didn't have face cam on that episode, I don't think.\nYeah, I don't think so.\nOllie, did you listen to it?\nOllie doesn't listen to any podcast.\nI can't listen to my brain.\nToo fried.\nI listen to zero podcast.\nIt's just, it's just not, like, I couldn't, even if I wanted to.\nLike, five minutes in, I would be doing something else without realizing, and it would just be, I would not be processing a single word.\nYeah.\nThe, the thing I do now is I go on YouTube and I copy the transcript, and I just paste it into chat if I really need to listen, like, listen or learn something, but I can't listen to pods.\nWhat I'm doing on train, Hyperunit, Felix, Hyperland, um, on Hyper EVM, Hyperlid.\nI did play a bit of Kamigoi because my brother was like, \"This is really cool, you should check it out.\"\nUm, so that's my hedge against Initia.\nUm, apart from that, nothing really, to be honest with you.\nLike, I'm kind of bored.\nI just, I hold Hyperliquid and Bitcoin, and then it's 40, 40, and then I have 20% cash.\nSo I don't know.\nMight be boring, but you probably outperform like almost everyone at least like to date.\nYeah, I talk about this quite often in my Slack, in my work Slack.\nI say, \"Hey, guys, um, on the, on the, on the topic of other ecosystems, this one is not one that I'm spending time on yet, but I really think that Inc. could be, could be really cool.\"\nUm, just imagine Base, but like without the feds.\nThat's, that's my vision for what Inc. is.\nUm, and I think that's worth a lot.\nI need a bit more of a pitch for this because this does not make sense to me intuitively for somebody to say, \"Hey, Kraken's L2.\nYeah, that's the one.\"\nI think I, I think they, it's a team there.\nTheir team is very, like, their team is much more like CT native, and like they understand a lot more about how, how like DeFi and crypto ecosystems work, I think, than Base does.\nBase is like, it feels like they're constantly trying to put a square peg into a round hole, and like sometimes it fits, and they get lucky with like, uh, I don't even know, like the last unique thing that they did on Base.\nLike, it's just an extension of, of Ethereum content.\nDude, those were so [Â __Â ] bad.\nI can't believe they did that.\nLike, that was, that's the worst meta I've ever seen.\nYeah, that's, that's exactly what I, like, what I think is a good example of like trying to put a square peg into a round hole.\nLike, I just don't, you know, they, they just don't, like, have, I mean, they're trying stuff, which is cool, but like, I don't think it's as, like, informed by actual, like, what people actually want as, uh, as like Inc. could be.\nMore and more often, I think Jesse is also like not a human.\nI think like, you know how people talk about, uh, officials as like lizard people.\nI think Jesse is probably a lizard person.\nI was, I more so think like, whenever I think of, like, you know, when you think of a chain, and you get like some form of an aesthetic in your head.\nYeah.\nThis is the one that I, I get when I think of, \"Oh my god, it's taking me a [Â __Â ] hour to do this.\"\nUm, professional podcaster, by the way.\nThis is my day job.\nI think of this every time I think of Base.\nLike, it's just like, you know, how do you, so, yeah, this is true.\nI just, it's just kind of a shame as well, because they have, they technically have all of the resources of Coinbase.\nThey have, they, they also had it, like, they had attention, they had the lead, they had everybody was like, \"Oh, it's, you have to launch on Solana or Base.\"\nLike, all of the VCs were even like Alliance was saying you have to launch on Salon or Base.\nOther funds were saying the same thing, I assume.\nAnd then they just, they're just kind of irrelevant now.\nLike, it's Aerodrome, and I feel like that's it, right?\nThey had Morpho, but I think that's, there's so much liquidity there.\nMorpho, I think, yeah, there's liquidity.\nMorpho is cool because they have like Coinbase integrations, and like they, they will have more in the future, probably.\nI think a big part of the, the Base thesis was always like the Coinbase smart wallet and being able to use Base from Coinbase.\nUm, which is like Kraken is also doing that.\nBut like, I don't know how, how, uh, I mean, you can't, like, really do much on chain from the Coinbase app right now, as I understand it, but they're planning to do more along those lines.\nSo it's like you're unlocking a whole new user group.\nUm, but, I don't know.\nI don't think that Arjun guy is pretty based.\nI really, I kind of like that guy.\nHe's the new co-founder of, or co-CEO of Kraken.\nI also, Kraken doesn't.\nThat's a big part.\nI'm probably biased, like Kraken.\nI was, I've been locked out of Coinbase and never used it again.\nYeah, that's what happened.\nI think a lot of people have, for no reason.\nFor no reason.\nLike, I hadn't used it in months.\nAll right.\nUm, guys, before we end it off, do you have, where should people, where do you want people to check out?\nDo you have anything that you want blurred on the screen saying make sure to follow X, make sure to look into Yo, please, uh, make sure to look into, uh, Initia, try some of the applications, earn some ES in it.\nWe give away like half a million dollars in ES every two weeks.\nSo, it's, uh, pretty, pretty good ROI if you're in it for the long haul.\nUm, things to check out other than like the Initia page.\nHonestly, just you're probably better off just like following Ali's Twitter.\nThere's probably good, good amount of alpha there.\nThat's where I get all my alpha.\nI feel like I don't tweet that much, like, alpha anymore.\nMaybe like every now and then.\nJust everyone just reply to all these tweets and just say alpha question mark until he gives you off.\nI'm going to block you.\nI will immediately block you.\nUm, yeah, I guess from my end, um, if you hold hype, you can deposit it on Volantis and earn yield and, uh, points on it from the lending markets.\nUh, there's going to be more pools there soon with different rewards on them.\nUh, it usually outperforms staking yield.\nIt's not right now just because volume's been low, but, um, that generally makes it the best place to park your hype if you just want pure yield on it.\nUm, and yeah, follow Atlantis, ask us questions, hang out with us, all that fun stuff.\nVery good, guys.\nThank you for coming on.\nThis was fun.\nMaybe, maybe you can post this on Exit Liquidity if you want.\nYou don't have to, but since you guys both did it, it might make sense.\nAnd we can do this.\nYeah.\nI mean, there you go.\nNo, you don't have to clip it up.\nI don't see why not.\nIt's been a while since we posted.\nWe'll probably just be lazy and retweet your post.\nWe're going to be honest.\nThat makes sense.\nWe can quote it.\nNo, but I appreciate you guys coming on.\nThis is fine.\nYeah.\nYeah, thanks.\nThanks, man.\nThanks for having us.\n[Music]\n",
