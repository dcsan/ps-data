the 0xResearch live stream.\nJoined today we've got Felix from Forward Guidance.\nGlad to have you on, sir.\nJames Christopher from the Telegram.\nUh, known individual.\nRyan Cash flows Connor and Westie from the data team.\nHow we all doing today, guys?\nWe're still alive and we're not crashing out.\nYeah, we're here.\nWe're doing a community outreach for uh for our brethren, you know, pulling in people like James from the Telegram and uh giving them some followers, giving them some clout.\nWhat's up, James?\nYou're here for the second 0xResearch pod now.\nThat's impressive.\nSecond time.\nIt's very, very exciting.\nHappy to be here.\nFirst time pre-recorded, second time live.\nWe love it.\nUm, Felix, glad to have you on.\nUh, I don't we don't usually get to pull you in.\nYou know, the macro and the DGEN and the deep research pieces don't often collide that frequently, but uh we the last time we had you on on the pod, I know we we tried to get a little bit into your uh onchain enjoyments, if you want to call it that.\nUm would love to do that today as well, but we also want some of your macro takes and I think it's probably a great idea to start off on markets.\nActually, a ton of stuff happened yesterday.\nUm, I was just listening actually to the to the Forward Guidance app.\nYou guys just dropped you and Tyler.\nUm, would love to just dive in, get your thoughts on the market and maybe some of the recent, you know, crash out news the other day and then let's just dive into it like how are people people feeling?\nUm, yeah.\nSo yeah, Tyler and I talked about this in the roundup, but uh I think the fact that the fact that the government is just going to keep on spending and running high def the fiscal deficits can basically be the uh catalyst for breaking up the the previous bromance that was Elon and Trump.\nJust goes to show how ingrained these dynamics are.\nUm, that was my biggest takeaway from this whole thing is just that you just cannot fight the beast that is Congress trying to be reelected and throwing money at their constituents.\nAnd the fact is, no matter, you know, how much you bang the drum about fiscal austerity and all these things, there's there's midterms that need to be won.\nThere's uh taxes that need to be cut.\nAnd so, here we are.\nYou know, it basically it basically broke them up.\nAnd I think that just goes to show how ingrained these dynamics are.\nAnd it it really really revitalizes my conviction in owning assets that can both be a tailwind and a hedge to that dynamic.\nSo I've been talking a lot about how important it is to focus on the fiscal side of things as opposed to the monetary, which is what we've been used to for the past two decades of just looking at, oh, what's Powell going to say at whatever press conference?\nAnd I mean, you just look at the past 5 years, like we are, especially the past like 3 years or so.\nWe're we're three years into having rates be quite a bit above the zero lower bound.\nAnd I feel like there's a lot of detractors that thought that that would cause a recession, that would cause, you know, speculative assets like Bitcoin to do badly.\nAnd it's just the complete opposite.\nAnd I think because that is so much driven by this fiscal side of things and that do I mean, you hear this idea of fiscal dominance and I don't think we're quite there for me.\nThe definition of that is when the fiscal side of things completely leads the charge and the Fed and the monetary policy side of things is there just to basically smoothen out that process and also to basically monetize any excess uh issuance that is required to lead fiscal policy.\nBut we're getting closer and closer to that point.\nUm obviously, you know, Powell is still the head of the Fed, but that's going to end in 2026.\nAnd whoever replaces him is going to be somebody who's blessed by Trump.\nAnd I think that'll be some some meaningful catalyst further towards this idea of fiscal dominance.\nSo yeah, when I just look through the noise, when I set aside all the tariff stuff, all of these different things to me, all the the core components are are still there and accelerating that uh make me bullish on on monetary hedges.\nSo still very excited about Bitcoin, still very excited about gold, still very excited about US equities.\nUm bearish, anything that is a fixed rate asset like treasury bonds.\nUm I think we're just going to continue into this world of of cyclically and secularly higher inflation.\nSo yeah, I don't know.\nIt feels like there's just, you know, there's narratives that pull us in one way or the other every single week, but when you just look at the core buckets of of what's there and what's driving things, it's it's all the same thing.\nSo there's there's no real reason for me to change my mind.\nObviously, you know, we're heading into the summer here and we could talk a bit about that, I'm sure, in terms of just how choppy and illquid summers are typically for crypto.\nAnd I think it's totally possible that we just mess around for a little while, drive people insane and um accelerates mental illness, but overall when I look at the big picture, it's just like it's the same old thing and it's and it's accelerating really.\nUm yeah, so that's where I'm at.\nFelix, do you think like h how do you quantify traditional markets and kind of like Trump exhaustion where the marginal headline and the marginal escalation on tariffs is having less and less of an effect?\nAnd do you think we get to a point where like we're we're just totally looking past that kind of stuff?\nUm, yeah, it's it's so funny because like you just you track through the headlines basically since Liberation Day and it's just been every week some sort of marginal in in the right direction.\nAt the same time that you know we saw we saw Trump come out and say oh we're going to potentially add 50% tariffs on Europe and that quickly got revised and the market didn't even really take it seriously that time.\nSo obviously that's been the driving factor of this whole like taco thing which I don't know feels like we're probably now opening up the risk of that being taken uh waiting it too too heavily.\nThis idea of just Trump always chickens out.\nUm so I don't know it's like with anything in markets you know is that when you just when you see the same thing hit the tape every single time.\nEvery single time it hits the tape it has a lower impact on it.\nAnd that can be Trump you know tariff headlines.\nIt can be yeah earnings releases pretty much anything you know.\nUm, so I feel like it's just, yeah, the way markets anticipate and and price in for changes.\nAnd for some reason, it just feels like a lot of people get too stuck up in where things are in the present day and and this like static thinking I kind of complain about um that too many people have.\nAnd yeah, you just have to look at like what's likely next as opposed to where it stands today.\nBut also balancing that with this like diminishing returns of pricing in those if that makes sense.\nShout out to Kristoff with the worst mic I've ever heard in my life.\nOh my god.\nIs that bad?\nSend him a pod mic now.\nI told him it was okay beforehand.\nAre you using wired headphones from 2011?\nLike what's going on?\nWell, first I had AirPod Pros and then Danny told me they sucked.\nSo now I'm on my computer.\nThey were worse.\nOh yeah, and you have the Lenovo.\nI'm on an Asus Vivo book now.\nTimes are tough, man.\nCan't afford it.\nThat's fair.\nHe need He really needs the markets to go up higher to afford new gear, I think.\nUm well, I guess maybe we start diving in into the more cryptocentric views as part of the recent market activity.\nI think really one of the big ones here is Circle the IPO\num listing at what like opening at 31.\nAnd could I jump in?\nI can we can we actually go back to macro for a moment there?\nSure.\nUm\nI have a question for Felix.\nUm\nlike I thought two interesting things from what you just said.\nOne is you didn't really talk about the Trump Elon breakup.\nDoes that matter to macro at all in terms of like Trump's ability to get things done?\nBecause he has a very tech- centric cabinet and there's like a potentially like I don't know maybe I'm reading too much in between the tea leaves but like he has a very Elon influenced cabinet and I think that there's potentially some risk of infighting there.\nAnd then two, from a macro perspective, I didn't hear a mention of AI um in terms of like what that does to the macro backdrop, like either near-term or long term.\nI'm wondering if you have any thoughts there.\nUm I'll before I answer both of those, I'll just say that I have no real good uh unique view on these, but I will say just off the cuff, um I think it's a good flag on the first part.\nYou know, I think it's it's really easy to look at these headlines of this uh you know, tech oligarchy breakup with the Trump administration and extrapolate it out into, you know, what does that mean for, you know, JD Vance sitting in the middle of of those two and trying to have to pick a side and, you know, the the Mark Andreas of the world, the the Chamas of the world, all these people that have sort of been been married between the two.\nYeah, it's a it's a decent um it's a decent risk.\nI I don't know really how it trickles out to be honest with you.\nUm you don't think the market cares like they're you don't think that they're thinking like I don't know.\nI'm just wondering if you think that people who are managing macro risk like are actually thinking about that thing.\nYeah.\nI mean it's a decent one, but we've also seen like a complete reversal already of it.\nI mean, maybe part of that is the draws report today that was like decent compared to the the ADP was pretty weak and people got off off a off base there and a little too bearish on the economy and the labor market.\nSo maybe it's part of that, but it also feels like a big reversal when people just stop for a second and think like what are the actual mechanical impacts and sure maybe it creates a few more headwinds around some of the more tech-centric policy decisions that they make.\nBut I think overall you have to weigh that against like the these these fiscal impulse dynamics that I mentioned that I just think are are so much more powerful.\nLike I've been thinking a lot about how what it means to be in this economic regime that we're in now where there's a lot of debt and now that debt is paying a pretty significant uh yield on it now.\nIt's it's paying four and a half% and that's happening at the same time that people's mortgages are sitting at 2 and a half% in a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.\nThat is, you know, you could jack rates to the Fed could jack rates to 10% and what would that actually do to mortgages?\nIt wouldn't change anything and then they would actually get a higher interest payment on their yield.\nSo I just feel like these dynamics just overwwayigh so many other things and it's it's why you see you have this you have the passive flows constantly going into markets you have the buybacks of every equity company.\nSo just it feels like every time we get one of these little shocks you just I think it's the reason why you see these V recoveries where you have you have the catalyst that brings it lower and then it's like a beach ball underwater because eventually those other flows I mentioned just have to take it up and come forth.\nSo yeah, I think it's a decent risk, but I just don't feel like it it overpowers those more powerful flows.\nAnyway, um and on the second question about AI, it's I mean I feel like some some other people here probably have better takes on AI than I am.\nUm I'm definitely a tourist, but I feel like you know there's the other day I was like working in in a spreadsheet and there were some charts I needed to make like 10 of them.\nAnd typically if I just did that manually it would have taken me a couple hours and instead there's like the Gemini integration into Google Sheets now and I just put in one prompt and it was done in 30 seconds and just that little tidbit in terms of extrapolating that across the world in terms of productivity.\nIt's it's going to improve things a lot.\nWill it improve, you know, to the point where we see like the the big, you know, spicy takes of like the anthropics EU talking about unemployment doubling in the next few years.\nYeah, maybe that's that's the case.\nBut I just have no edge in in in forecasting that.\nBut I don't know.\nI've talked a lot.\nI'd love to hear what other people's takes are on the impact of of AI on the uh the economy in the world.\nYeah.\nI my my personal belief, and this is someone who used to do macro, no longer does, and now just mostly focuses on AI and crypto, is that um you know, in 2022, I think a lot of macro people just got everything wrong.\nUh 2002 22 into into 23.\nUm all like you know you used to see these lead lag models pretty popular on um at least like retail like in retail macro circles and you know they were they were popular in professional macro circles as well and they all stopped working.\nSo if you were at if you're going to have a model that predicted the change in unemployment which would also signal a recession because unemployment spikes in a recession.\nI think if you had 50 met metrics that would predict that on a league lead lag basis, 49 of them said that unemployment should have ripped in 20 in the back half of 23.\nIt did not or pro or actually sorry probably the first half of 24 it did not.\nUm and like so what caused that?\nUm I think you have a very obvious inflection in the fourth quarter of 2023 which was AI capex spend and just like um you know the Keynesian animal spirits around this technology.\nYou saw it in construction spending in the US that went parabolic that was mostly dri driven by data centers and\n\n\nYou have the largest components of the S&amp;P 500, all who generate either high tens of billions or low hundreds of billions in free cash flow per year. The most cash-flowing, generating entities in the history of capitalism, all spending as much as they can on capex in the United States, right? And that filters into local economies and creates job growth. So you have this like weird, um, you actually have this weird trend now in U3 unemployment that it just doesn't look like it does historically, or it's taking longer to like kind of take off than it has. You have this weird trend in PMI that, you know, the chart hasn't looked that way for 15 or so years. Um, but like I'm willing, as someone who just knows like the high-level data, I'm willing to say that that's all the animal spirits coming from uh, AI investment out of the largest companies in the United States that have to put cash to work there. Um, so I don't know. I personally believe that that's the biggest um, force in macro. Like you mentioned earlier, um, you know, high rates happened, everyone thought the economy couldn't handle it. I think that that was almost true until AI, right? Because like now you have ROI is potentially higher, and that hurdle rate of interest rate expense matters a lot less.\n\nSo I don't know. I'm of the opinion that like the cycle keeps going. I understand all the flow stuff and fiscal spending and stuff, but I even think that you could get a decline in fiscal spending and it wouldn't matter because um, the mega caps are just going to pick that up, and all the startup and venture funding is going to keep flowing into the economy to capture this AI opportunity, which I believe all these biggest players view as existential, right? So they have to spend that cash. Yeah, those are great points. I feel like it's that's definitely a huge chunk of it. I would say it's that compared with just inaccurate analysis because, you know, you rewind back to 2021, and it's like the Fed can't, you know, there was, I remember there's like, you know, Jamie Diamond is saying Fed funds might go to 2 and a half%, and everybody was like, no way, that's ridiculous, like the economy can't handle that. And I think a lot of it is for sure the AI cap expand and productivity gains, but also I think just an incorrect analysis of what happens when you have corporates that have turned out their debt on the long end for many, many years and households doing that on their household balance sheets, in terms of mortgages, in terms of the fact that the flow through of interest rate hikes does not affect the economy like it used to. So, I feel like it's a combination of both. I think that's a really good point that I probably underweight that side of things. Um, but the two together, I think, just makes the entire economy less cyclical and and more just other secular exponential. For sure. I remember looking at the 2-year rate in the back half of 21 and thinking to myself, this is never going to get off zero. Like I literally said that to myself, and that was my expectation. And then when it went to two and a half, or maybe it was two, um, yeah, I was certain that the economy couldn't handle it. I think everyone was, and and look where we are.\n\nSo I think something that's interesting, Ben Eert had a really good tweet thread last week of, to your point, Ryan, of like, yeah, the capex spend is totally real, but I think people are extrapolating and kind of being a little too doomerism on productivity gains, right? Like we have yet to hear on an earnings call, like a CEO of a big corporate coming out and saying, hey, we're we're jamming five billion into buying productivity tools, and we're going to fire, you know, 10% of our workforce as a result of this. And I'm not saying it's not going to happen, but I think it's probably a bit further off than people think. And it's going to be predominantly capex driven for the next couple of years before we start to see like mass layoffs, um, and like, you know, real implementation of this stuff. I will say anecdotally, I have a lot of family members and their friends that are in the like graduating college, like new to the workforce class, and like I'm hearing a lot of stories of the job market for them being like horrible due to a mix of like just the way things are currently, but also like hearing that AI is the reason that they're hiring less for those like junior your entry level positions. And so I think, yeah, anecdotally it's already being felt, but on the macro, you're not really seeing it quite yet.\n\nDid you guys see Circle just hit an all-time high?\nYeah. 108. Oh, 118. Oh, wow. I'm delayed, I guess.\n100x long or short right now. What do you say, Felix?\nOh my god. Um, I got my finger on the green.\nIt's like, I don't know. I haven't looked at what the float is of the Circle IPO, but uh, it's just that, yeah, these things are crazy when they first launch. And you have that compared with just like the lack of lack of cash-flowing companies in crypto. Maybe Ryan Cashful Connors can elaborate a bit on it, but uh, yeah, it just feels like it's just like the valuation is not the concern right now just because of just the lack of options for crypto exposure, sort of. So, it's like I have no idea where this thing can go.\n\nYeah, Ryan, you shared some info on like a model the other day in an internal chat. But I guess I'm curious like if you have a deeper take there, but I that's the feeling I get is what Felix said, like there are very limited options, and it's just like if you want to allocate to this, that's like one of the very few public options to do so right now. Yeah. I think that Circle and IBIT are all market structure. I mean, all, I don't want to be, um, all, all is strong, but I, I think that there are two forces here that are somewhat contradictory, but are both true, is that one, uh, hedge fund managers and and RIAs, they want crypto exposure, so they're going toward the things that are most familiar, which is why Bitcoin did well, ETH did poorly, and why Circle is doing well because they're stable coin adjacent and adjacent, and people understand stable coins and trify. But I also think that like a huge part of their story is market structure. There are so few options that the, you know, if you want a pure play, which every hedge fund manager, RIA wants a pure play, like you don't want to buy JP Morgan to get stable coin exposure, even though they're going to make money from stable coins one day. You want to buy Circle because it's easy to explain to a client. You can more easily like manage that direct exposure, um, rather than within a conglomerate uh, exposure.\n\nUm, so yeah, I, I think that there's a large market structure story here. Um, so like first to market on these products, like matters, right? Like Solana getting an ETF therefore matters because market structure matters. Um, it's just like kind of the state that that that we're in right now. Um, you know, what would happen to Circle if Bitfinex were, you know, able to IPO? Like I don't think we're ever going to know, but um, yeah. Yeah, it's all market structure, I think.\nYeah. What other way do you have to get exposure to stable coins directly? Like every other way is completely indirect. I guess Coinbase might be a decent proxy, given, you know, their proximity to Circle, but yeah, this is like the purest way to get exposure to stable coins. Anyone who was at DAS, I mean, I wasn't there, but it was all I heard from takeaways of the conference was every single person there was bullish on stable coins and their growth and potential. You have Shimoth every week on Allin mentioning stable coins in some way, shape, or form. It's very clearly hit the Trafi uh, mainstream, if you will, where everyone I think has come to the conclusions that stable coins are good. They have product market fit. They're growing fast. And so, yeah, it's like, okay, how do you get exposure to that? It's it's literally just the Circle IPO. There's no other pure way.\n\nIt it begs the question, go ahead, James. No, no, please. Okay. I was going to say it begs the question of um, like you mentioned both Ryan's here, the uh, market structure question I think is interesting because it's, you know, let's say Circle wasn't the only option. I mean, if we look out a few years from now, I mean, how do we expect things to unfold? I mean, do we really do we think Circle is going to be a big winner here, or are we looking at other things now and and forecasting, you know, these guys are eventually going to go public? This token is eventually going to come to market, and that's where I would really want to like put my cards on the table. Yeah. The big question for me is about, so it feels like this double-edged sword now where one side is going to have to be a loser. So the reason I say that has to do with where does the interest go for these stable coins. So if if the Genius Act goes like it's proposed right now and there won't be interest allowed on these stable coins, that means 100% net interest margin for these stable coin issuers, that is very profitable for them. Like you think about money market funds, you know, they they will collect fees, but overall most of that interest gets passed on to the owners of the money money market funds. Um, so you have this situation where either you have something like, you know, obviously Circle, part of it is that if you own on Coinbase, you get part of that yield, but just in speaking in general terms, it's either these stable coin issues issuers get 100% of the net interest margin and the consumers get zero yield, in which case if you're if we're talking about that trady money that wants to be in like money market funds or, you know, the money market funds 2.0, know, which is how I see stable coins. Either they have to sacrifice not getting any yield as opposed to getting four and a half% in money market funds, or on the other side of things is the stable coin issuers get to keep that 100% net interest margin and make a [ __ ] ton of money. And so I feel like the biggest question at hand is where does that end up? And yeah, I mean, if it gets passed in Congress and these these uh, big stable coin issuers can't pass on the yield to consumers, that's going to be great for the companies, but it means that adoption from money market funds will probably not exist because why the hell would they own it if the owners of those stable coins can't get a yield?\n\nIt's uh, it's a weird one. Um, I don't really know where it goes. So that's kind of like exactly where I was going to go, Felix. Like if if you go down this route of massive trady, stable coin adoption and the issuers keeping the interest, I think it's very, very unlikely that names like Croup, JP Morgan, BA are happy to dive deep into this business and support stable coin rails, but somehow allow this weird nichy little company called Circle to own everything. That That's the Circle. No pun intended. That's a terrible joke that I can't square. Like I I just don't understand why you would want to bet on this standalone business to be totally honest. Like you you can price forward-looking NIM very, very well. Um, and if you look at Circle right now, I don't I don't know why you would buy it at the current valuation if you're bullish on stable coins and it's a cruel of NIM. I agree. It's it's certainly pricey right now.\n\nAlso, non non-zero chance that a lot of retail capital is moving it, but I have no I have no inside baseball there, guys. I got to run. Um, but I'll be back in 30 minutes.\nPeace y'all. See you, Ryan. I'll see you, Ryan.\nYeah. So, I don't know. It feels like somebody's going to win, somebody's going to lose. Um, it feels like it's more likely for the consumer base to lose, assuming the Genius Act gets passed and you can't have interest on these stable coins, in which case maybe the the runway for Circle is is more attractive, but yeah, if you start to get interest-bearing stable coins, these like, you know, we obviously we can't see the profitability of these other stable coin issuers like we can with Circle now that they're public, um, and overall what you can see in those is that yeah, the gross margin is entirely just because of the fact that they don't have to pass on these uh, well, obviously they do through Coinbase. Um, but you can just extrapolate that and kind of set it aside and just be like, okay, well, the only reason they're like somewhat profitable is because this weird situation where they have 100% net interest margin and the consumer base does not expect yields. But uh, if if we go into the direction that like James is talking about where the JP Morgans and like the the Schwabs of the world come in with their like digital money market funds and start passing on yield, suddenly those margins get compressed and these valuations just just don't make sense. But again, you have to set that aside against the dynamic that is that it's one of the only options for exposure and people hit buy and market structure, you know, if that happens in a situation where the float is super low, which I assume it is. Um, I haven't looked at the numbers, but you know, to see it just whipping around like this, I assume the float is very, very small.\nYeah, I'll tell you right now. So, two, what is it? 202 million shares outstanding, 175 million float. Not terrible, actually. Yeah, that's decent.\nOne of the things that's been interesting is I would have thought, given the success of the Circle IPO, that stable coin protocol like governance tokens would perform really well, and to be honest, like there hasn't been much outperformance of like your your makers or Athenas. I've also been seeing a ton of people float uh, Forax thesis recently, given their like ties to um, like the Genius Act stuff, like they're really trying to penetrate um, like DC in a weird way, and also funds are super underexposed, which I thought was like a super interesting thesis, but and that has been like outperforming recently, but ever since the Circle IPO, just absolutely thing. Do you guys remember when Frack was going to get a Fed Master account?\nI do remember that.\nYeah. I mean, it's it it brings up the debate of like these useless governance coins versus Yeah. actual cash flow occurring to stable coin issuers, right? Like Ethe, I I love the project, but the token itself is is is a tough one in terms of the, you know, value flow through into it, and yeah, maker seems like another one that's a little bit better. Um, I don't know too much about the specifics, maybe you guys can expand, but yeah, it\n\n\nIt just feels like the endless issue of the tokconomic structures and the governance coins that just don't have anything that they can claim onto it versus like these actual equity ownership and stable coins. And it just feels like a continuation of that dynamic of like, huh, these governance coins like may not be the best framework for creating, uh, you know, exposure to crypto markets, right? Like I think there's a good fundamental reason why we've seen a lot of people get really excited about like crypto stocks like Robin Hood as opposed to, you know, the the 10th iteration of a random governance coin, right? Like this just it's just a way better form format.\n\nYeah, we talked about this a lot on the pod. I want to say a few months back, maybe when Kaio was a hot topic or when that token dropped and just discussing, you know, there's the endless debate of the token versus the labs entity or the equity or whatever. We have this kind of dual structure that's been very pervasive. Um, not quite stable coin specific, but maybe this is worth discussing Morpho in this recent announcement from them. But to that point, I do agree with you to an extent, Felix. I think as long as we continue with this structure of there's some labs or other entity equity structure loosely associated with then this token to some basically, you know, if it's a successful protocol, some cash flow generating business, and then you're choosing to divvy up the revenue between multiple places, it's like you just you end up with a much less attractive offering and a lot of uncertainty there in terms of, you know, am I always only going to get 25 or 50% of the revenue? Am I going to get 75 or 100% in the future? Do I actually even have any right to that? Like, can they just yank that away at any point? Um, I think that's a big problem. I'm curious. I'm just going to read a quick note here from Morpho, but they mentioned that what they're going to be doing here is Morpho Labs will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Morpho Association to eliminate perceived conflicts with equity value and ensure that token holders and the contributing entities share the same incentive. It sounds like a good step in the right direction to me. I'm curious your guys' thoughts, like, should more protocols just be doing this, like, do away with the conflict with labs, have it all under the token?\n\nYeah. I mean, initial thoughts are this is fantastic and a step in the right direction. I think it became sort of the norm to have like a foundation labs arm, like once one person did it, uh, and like no one discounted the token as a result of having that kind of structure. You just saw it pop up again and again. But there was one interesting talk from DBA's recent research day from Felipe at Thea talking about how uh, liquid token markets right now are broken. And there's a bunch of different elements to that. One of them definitely being this like equity versus token uh mismatch, um, making it really, really hard to invest in actual tokens because you don't know whether like the cash flow will actually accrue to the token or not. Uh, and you don't know whether things will change in the future versus now, uh, given that the foundations and labs have so much control over the supply and can just change things via governance at will. There's also other pieces of like, you need to discount uh, token liquidity versus equity in like a huge way. And so just off the bat, tokens need to be valued at less than equity. I highly recommend people go uh, listen to that talk. But yeah, I mean, the only way you really solve this is through creating new norms and also the market starting to price these things in that like the token should be valued at much less than the equity if there's no value going to that token. Hands, like we're also working on something uh, that should help with this sort of uh, transparency or rather like creating norms within the industry that these teams should follow and that the market should price these things based on those uh, sort of elements. So yeah, I think Morpho is doing a fantastic job sort of putting their foot down, putting things in the right direction and and setting an example for other teams going forward that you don't have to do this. Like I feel like people felt in the past they had to do this kind of structure because that's that's what teams do. That's what you do. So having a path that's different, I think is very, very valuable. And the Morpho team is great, and I'm not surprised that they did this as well. So yeah, I'm happy about it.\n\nYeah, that data video was really, really good. I think the other thing too from this announcement that I really appreciate is lower in the article, they talk about how it's become the norm for when we start to move towards this idea of fee switching for protocols. The assumption is, oh well, let's like give these out to equity owners as a dividend. And you know, maybe James can riff on this too as we bring in the like crypto once again, like it always falls prey to this idea of just like reinventing the mistakes that TradFi has already worked through. And so now we're in this situation where there's like this owner base that is like, well, I want 100% dividend on retained earnings from this company. And when you like that is just if you started to ask that against like early stage growth companies, they'd be like, what the hell are you talking about? Like, why would we give out a 100% like dividend payout ratio? That's absolutely ridiculous versus reinvesting in the company. So they also mentioned in there about how they want to do away with this notion of just spitting out cash flows to others because the idea there, like when you think about capital structure and equity structure, the idea is that we like when you go through the calculus of deciding your dividend pay ratio, you're making the calculus of is it more creative for us to give it to the equity owner or do we think we can get a higher internal rate of return on it internally investing it? And this notion of the expectation of giving out all the fees to equity owners and not reinvesting it into the company is just way too far to the other side of the extreme. But it's somewhat valid of a criticism because they've been so burned on the fact that they haven't gotten anything. They've just had governance tokens. So I think the combination of fixing equity structure along with this idea of let's rethink these as actual companies and actually be a bit more pragmatic about our dividend payout ratios, i.e. throwing off these to equity owners is a really good thing. Um, yeah, James, what's your take on that? I'm curious.\n\nI think it's just like kind of obvious, right? Like I think people are people are done listening to protocols say, \"Well, we're not we're not in control of this. The foundation is,\" and the foundation saying, \"Well, we're not in control of that. The labs is.\" And like I feel like people are totally, totally exhausted of that over the last year or two. Um, so yeah, I've got nothing but good things to say about it. I think it's very, very obviously a good thing.\n\nYeah, I I think I'm inclined to agree completely with you here, Felix. I feel like if you collapse this structure that is has been pervasive, you remove a lot of the I think you made the point so well that just like, you know, as maybe a token purchaser today of a lot of these weird structures that probably you're going to get a small fraction of revenues maybe redirected at the thing at at maybe not even now, maybe at some point in the future. And so it makes sense that the thought is, well, if they're going to give me anything, like, you know, buy back the token or just like give it all to me, you know, because we don't, you know, if 75% is going to labs team, like we don't even know if they're reinvesting it in the protocol, are they paying themselves fat salaries and just sitting around? Like you have no, we have no insight. There's very little transparency, I think, to a lot of these activities today, and so it doesn't surprise me that a lot of the sentiment today around the flows that go to the token are very much just like pay it out. We want, we want the money for the investment. Um, and I think if you if you eliminate a lot of that stuff, you get more transparency around what the spending looks like, how we're allocating, how what growth strategies look like going forward. Um, and it's all under this one common investment vehicle or token or asset or whatever you want to call it. Um, it it can remove a lot of that friction, which is what I see it as today is it's this is an expression of all that friction. And Danny, I don't want to jump the gun, but I think it kind of dovetails into this conversation. Like I think that's probably the number one reason that people are so pissed off about the pump ICO, right? Like this this split. Like this is it, right? Third biggest ICO of all time. And it's unclear, right? Like even if it gets 25% of the revenue, it's still to me that's that's not enough, right? To come out and raise a billion dollars.\n\nYeah, I think it's a I think it's a fair point and I and I understand and I'd love your guys' takes here. I understand why teams still operate this way. One, it's good for them, right? They get a kind of a double win here. They have some equity, they have some tokens, they can, you know, the equity gets raised up, they drop the token, they can use the token to incentivize things. Maybe the incentivization of the thing then raises the value of the, you know, the perceived value of the equity. There's a lot of things going on there. Um, but also like the prior regulatory climate, like I'm sure there are still teams who would be scared or very cautious about saying, \"Hey, we don't we're not even going to have equity.\" Like it's all just the token. You know, I think there's been a few, right? Kaido was one where they're just like the token is the thing. You know, we're doing the token and like that represents like what we're building here. Um, but, you know, it doesn't surprise me that that other teams would maybe still be hesitant. But in the new administration, it seems like maybe you can maybe you can step on the regulatory gray line a little bit more. Um, you know, the SEC is certainly leaning far more openly than they have, you know, in the prior sort of regime. Um, and it it seems like it's an opportunity to to push those boundaries and like, you know, if we need to go fully, you know, token operated businesses basically, um, now's the time to test that out. And I agree with you, right? The kind of current rumor is that 25% of revenues would go to the token, which is is far different than if all of the, you know, they're on they're on track for 500 million plus in annualized revenue this year. So, it's it's a ton of money. Um, and to see 75% of that go to a team and be opaque and transparent like all the other projects of the past, yeah, it would be a big letdown.\n\nYeah. Yeah, I I think they would do themselves a service if they were like, you don't we don't need the full road map, but give us an idea of like what are you going to spend it on because like there's a very nonzero probability that they just special dividend out like half a billion dollars to VCs and like that's totally fine. I guess they can do it, but I think like some transparency. Are you guys going to buy streamers? Are you going to do contracts? Like just give the community an idea of like what you think you're going to spend this money on before you raise it to to just to just take a billion is is very tough to me.\n\nYeah. It's it's like if they went through a traditional route to raise this kind of money, obviously the investors are going to ask that like what are you going to do with the money? So the fact like ICOs and and one of the downfalls, and I'm a big proponent of ICOs. One of the downfalls is just you don't really have to have that much transparency, like the community will just like for the most part fund you, especially if you get enough people, like enough eyeballs on your ICO, like you're probably going to get the money without having to actually disclose what you're going to do with it. And that was a lot of issues of the previous ICO era is people just threw money at anything and you could just literally have a fake project and rug it. So yeah, I think they should have way more transparency over what they're doing with a billion dollars. Um, I strongly agree, and one of the things that I feel like every day frustrates me is that we we work in an industry that like one of the the number one values is transparency. The fact that we're working with blockchains and that everything is available to see, um, that like we still have such crazy opaqueness when it comes to, you know, teams launching tokens and what they're doing with the money, like it's it's pretty absurd. Like we as an industry should be setting a standard way above TradFi of like in real time tracking where money is going, how it's being spent, how much revenue is being driven, and what are users doing? Like we should have this all in real time in a much faster pace than TradFi. And the fact we're not doing that, like blows my mind and and frustrates me a lot.\n\nYeah, 100%. I'm curious what you guys think about what that does for L1 tokens versus like the applications that sit on top of them that end up being the ones that end up having cash flows and profitability and and revenues, and like it just I mean it it feels like every L1 is going through this existential moment of like doing some weird trickery of not even trickery, maybe that's too exaggerated, but just like trying to jump through every sort of hoop to try to get any sort of value curl. So it's like L1 token, meanwhile, these applications come in, find product market fit, start getting fees like crazy, and then yeah, you start to wonder, okay, pump token versus Solana, right? Like which one is the better hold?\n\nIf I don't know most of the activity is just like on pump fun and you know what if they just go off and and start their own blockchain, right? Like that's where what does that do for the L1 token? It just I don't know, it feels like a huge headwind for\n\nJames, look like you had thoughts. I have a lot of thoughts on this topic.\n\nYeah, I I think like first at a high level, like I'm perpetually confused that people in crypto are still obsessed with valuing things on the near term on cash flows. Like it's it's to me like I think Rev is\n\n\nRev is really cool in terms of showing momentum and directions. I think it tells you very, very little, if not nothing, about the value of something. Um, but also, like, if you look at early-stage venture, which is kind of what I think we're all doing here, like, no one would look at Open AI and say, \"Hey, let's slap a multiple on this thing. What do the cash flows look like in 10 years? What's the immediate term value accrual?\" I'm not really sure why or if anyone is really accurately modeling this stuff for cash flows and kind of what the obsession is with that. Um, and you even see stuff that, like, every single time there's a token in a cycle that occurs tons of cash flow, right? I'm thinking of like Sushi Swap in 2020, 2021, right? Everyone had all these amazing DCF models, and God, I was going to print so much money, and it just never works out. Um, so I don't know, Westie, what do you think?\n\nI'm glad you brought that up as well. So yeah, I like, mostly agree that, like, in the short term, like right now, if you're looking at rev of the major chains, that doesn't really tell you much because we are, like, these are still early-stage venture bets. But at the same time, when you look in the future, you're optimizing for growth now, but at a certain point, you want that growth to actually capture value, and if you're a blockchain, the way you capture value is people paying to be in the chain, which is rev. So you're optimizing for future rev. Now there's obviously a debate on whether current rev is a good predictor of future rev, which it's probably not, especially when there's a bunch of memecoin trading. You don't know how long that'll last. Maybe that's here forever. Maybe it's just here for a short time. But you're still optimizing for rev.\n\nAnd so this gets to the questions of, like, L1 valuations. I think for the most part, L1's and, like, really a lot of chains as a whole are pretty overvalued. There's a, like, I think right now they're basically valued on, like, people dreaming about, okay, smart contracts are going to be really big. What's the probability chance that this takes a certain percentage of market share of that, and so it gets priced at in the billions, tens of billions of dollars. The problem is, like, that sort of worldview is, is, like, very much future-looking, and so there's no way to actually come back to reality of, like, okay, in the future, how much cash flow are these things going to generate? And really, what you should be looking for is, again, future rev, and over time, we're going to see the amount of margins that come from rev go down over time because right now a lot of it is, like, sandwich, uh, like arbitrage, really, like inefficient, uh, price discovery. It's like a lot of memecoin trading, and and yeah, like people that have insensitive, uh, like buys and also, like, yeah, just and also, yeah, people exploiting that via sandwiching, etc. And so that's going to come down over time, and as a result, like, L1's are a very low-margin business in the long run. Um, and when you, like, think terminally of, like, okay, let's say we ramp up TPS and, like, the median fee is, like, less than a penny because we want as much activity as possible, these things don't make that much money, uh, when you, like, you actually calculate things out. And so yeah, I think L1's are, like, for the most part, overvalued unless they have an enshrined application, uh, and that application is generating revenue. Oh, speaking of, tell us about applications that fit that. No, no.\n\nUm, so there's this one called Hyperliquid. It is Boy, you wouldn't believe it. Um, Wesley, I have a question about this. Yeah.\n\nHow, cuz I didn't, I was, I wasn't listening. I'm sorry. I just Yeah, you just What's up? What's up? I was wondering, um, how long is this, like, L1 valuations are, I guess, L1 fees are going to go to zero? Like, in what time frame do you say that? Is it like a five-year thing? Is it like a three-year thing? Is it like a 15-year thing? What are we talking about here? I mean, in terms of, like, like a per transaction basis, it's probably like a five-year thing. I think you just, you see, basically, like, the whole thing is, you want median fees to go down, you want number of transactions to go way up. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nYeah. So, like, I think on the next five years, you see median fees go way down as there's just, like, more efficient me architecture, more competition, and, like, apps also, like, sequencing things and taking a lot of that me, like, margins would compress, the median fee goes down. But the hope is that you're the place that everyone congregates and there's value in having shared state, which I think there is, and that, like, you become a chain for a bunch of these things, or again, you have an enshrined application, and that application can have high margins or its own form of revenue in the case of Hyperliquid purping. Yeah. Do you see anything, like, if you look at it from a call, like, a value fundamental perspective that you'd be comfortable holding for, like, four or five years and just locking it away, where, like, we're still in this momentum, um, market where, where Yeah. It's just BTC is the only thing you're comfortable holding, and everything else is just a trade.\n\nYeah. I mean, that's how I view things. Yeah. Bitcoin is, like, the only thing that I can hold on a five-plus year time horizon and feel comfortable. Everything else is a trade for the most part. And, like, even looking at that, like, let's say we're, like, right now forming the the future mag seven of crypto, and that, like, you as a, as an example, maybe that eventually gets to trillions, right? But in the meantime, it's going to go through waves of, like, up and down, 80%, like, down 80% from tops. And so if you can trade it well, you can also compound that. So to me, it makes the most sense to trade everything that isn't Bitcoin. Yeah, I think you saw this this year as well with\n\nOh, Felix, he just disappeared, man. He said, \"Fuck you. I want to Sorry, I'm still here. I got to jump in a minute, but I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, but I'm still sorting here.\" Yeah. I want to Let's cut in the middle here real quick. I think we'll we'll get back to this conversation because I think it's a good topic, but I want to say thanks Felix for coming on. Appreciated the macro takes. Love getting into the details. Uh, if you have any last takeaways here on just this this valuation piece or if you're just excited to see it play out. Uh, happy to hear it. But then also Ian, glad to have you on as well. Kyros research boy. Um, we will pick up the conversation here. Um, any last last words, Felix? Otherwise, we will see you on the Forward Guidance podcast as per usual.\n\nUm, yeah, no major final thoughts. I think it's just like, I think Jay brought up a decent point that this obsession with, like, near-term cash flows just feels like a natural reaction to just how shitty the situation has been the past few years for the token structures that we've had. So, I feel like it's a reasonable just reaction to the other side of things. But I feel like now, and this is what I really liked about that Morpho piece, was just this, like, understanding of, okay, we need to have a bit more pragmatism around, like, basically, like, dividend payout ratio of fees, like, how much do we just reinvest in the firm versus give it to equity holders. So yeah, I I'm I'm excited about the next iteration of things because obviously so much of this too has just been so hamstrung by the regulatory situation where it's just been so difficult to create these token structures. So I feel like my high level is just we're in this interesting transition stage where a lot of these useless governance coins that were created the last few years just because out of necessity. Well, you know, we're we're still seeing them go basically down only. And I think that's just a natural progression of markets. Meanwhile, you know, things like, like Circle and then other projects like Hyperliquid that show actual, like, product market fit and good tokconomic structures start to decouple from those. And I'm really excited for the token structures that are going to be probably worked on right now by devs and coming out in, like, a year and a half. I think they're going to be really, really great. So yeah, I feel like things are going in the right direction. We're just like in this weird transition stage out of, like, the terrible SEC regulatory situation we had and where we're headed from here and the token structures just don't really exist yet except for, like, a few exceptions. So yeah, I'm optimistic. Um, yeah, don't want to fall plate to financial nihilism and go punch coins all the time. Um, I think good things are coming overall.\n\nLove it. Thanks for coming on and hopefully we'll have you on again sometime soon. Definitely love to do this. See you guys.\n\nActually, this would have been relevant for Felix as well, but I wanted to ask you were too late. Sorry. what the blowup risk for these new um vehicles are. You know what I mean? Like Meta Planet. I don't understand what the like I understand that eventually there might be a cascading issue, but I I just don't understand why exactly it is, which is why which is what I wanted to ask him. If there's any bank or anybody in like traditional finance on this call, that would also be beneficial. But we can see Yeah. If only we had someone like that who could, you know, just give us some some valuable insights. What do we want to talk about, Bach? I don't understand why, like, what's the Can you explain to me, like, you're speaking to a very stupid child? Yeah. What, like, the micro strategy bad scenario end game is, but, like, really dumb it down for me. Sure.\n\nSo, like, think think of a very traditional company that wants to borrow money in capital markets, right? So Apple goes out there and they float unsecured general corporate debt, right? So maybe they'll issue at, like, I don't know, x percentage, they'll repay it in seven years, and they make regular coupon payments. Super, super vanilla. Now think of a convertible bond as an unsecured debt instrument that pays a very, very low coupon, basically effectively zero. But the difference is convertible bond, like its name, can be converted into equity, right? So at a certain conversion price and a conversion ratio, and these are all different for each type of convert, it's convertible into common equity. So you basically have a piece of straight debt with a call option embedded in it, right? So you can you can price this with, like, Black-Scholes and tons of traditional models. Um, so that's that's kind of, like, super high level how a convert works, right? So Micro Strategy's obvious obviously found a ton of buyers for that debt, mostly within the convertible arbitrage community. Um, and just to keep it super, super basic, the way that those types of trades work, a convert arb fund will long the debt and then short the common equity, and they'll delta hedge that on a regular basis, right? So, so there's a there's a natural buyer for the paper there. Um, in terms of, like, the blowup risk for for Micro Strategy, I agree with most people that there's not really, like, a blowup risk where he sells all of his Bitcoin, right? Like, that's that's not really a thing. So, you have you have two situations with a convertible debt instrument. One, either the equity trades really, really well and it converts to equity, right? And then the paper's retired and Micro Strategy doesn't need to to pay anything back. Or you have the other scenario where the converts busted and the equity, this is kind of the more interesting piece, right? Where the equity is trading very poorly. You assume the MNAV of Micro Strategy is also trading pretty poorly. So you get to an end scenario and I don't know, I can I can pull it up on a computer in a second, like, what the Micro Strategy debt distribution is. Like, I'm pretty sure the first um convert doesn't come due until, like, 2028, something like that. Let me see. Uh, it's loading. Whatever. It doesn't matter. 2028 or 2029. So, assume the convert's busted and you can't repay it. What the seller do to repay that? So, one, he could sell Bitcoin to do it, but more likely he's probably just going to try to issue more debt or more preferred equity or something um to do that, right? So, I don't think there's, like, a blowup risk in that. You're not going to wake up one day and get, like, the whale alert that Michael Sailor is selling, you know, 10,000 Bitcoin to repay something. Um, but I think more on, like, a micro structure basis and what's more interesting to me is not asking the question when Michael Seller is going to sell Bitcoin, but more what's a situation that causes him to buy less Bitcoin and that effect on markets, like, that that buying pressure, like, you don't need to sell something for the market to collapse. You can also just buy less, right? And that's something that I think is is is worth thinking about. Yeah.\n\nYeah. To me, it's less about, like, these strategy and strategy clones blowing up and needing to sell, like, being forced sellers. It's that these are the biggest idiosyncratic buyers of of Bitcoin and also, like, some of the largest tokens in the market. And if all of a sudden there's a reason why they're buying less, then that has a cascading effect on prices.\n\nYeah, I think people underestimate how much he's bought.\n\nUm, I should probably pull this up. There's this website called Sailor Tracker. I'm sure everybody's familiar with it, but I think he bought 20 bill in the second half of Yeah, they they own about they own about half as much um as all the the BTC ETFs combined last I checked, like, two days ago. Yeah. I mean, it's ridiculous. Um, but what about this is not related to this as much, but what do we think about um the entire, like, all of the now copycat vehicles popping up and if that is kind of a toppy signal? I don't like saying this is a top signal, but to me, that feels a bit like a bit much. You know, I like one of the questions. I mean, yes, it's certainly different. It's certainly I think accompanied by a lot of additional froth in the market from other things that we're seeing. Um, and I think it's just because there's so much excitement. Uh, like we finally have, like, the the tailwinds in the industry. But one of the things I'm wondering is, like, um, and James, you might know this, but, like, how do all of these new treasury\n\n\nCompanies that are popping up, how do they actually pay their employees?\nLike, how do they make any money at all?\nLike, their whole business is predicated on just being able to issue debt and then buy tokens.\nAnd like, to my understanding, like, it's like at least with MicroStrategy, they had like this, you know, bit of a dinosaur analytics business that kind of lived for a while, and now like it's still there.\nLike, it has, they have like a bit of AR there, but like all these new companies, like they have no actual business, um, for the most part.\nSo, curious if anyone knows how like they're making any money.\nLike, that's the entire goal as well of that these companies.\nIt's like, how are they paying these people?\nAnd also, like, uh, did any of you guys listen to the light speed pod that Jack did with um, the DeFi development corp investor relations guy, I believe?\nUm, yeah, it was a good pod.\nI think people should go and listen to that.\nUm, but yeah, I mean, just first question, I guess, first, uh, around like, how do these people make money?\nHow do these companies make money outside of purely this business?\nJames, do you know?\nI mean, you don't have to, right?\nIs the simple answer.\nLike, you can in the same, in the same way that Tether can run their company with 25 people.\nLike, you can spin up an SPV tomorrow.\nYou can raise like 10 million bucks of equity that's going to pay your overhead and your health insurance for, for like forever.\nAnd that's also one thing, like, like MicroStrategy's business doesn't make money anymore.\nLike, it, like that, like they're, they're done, right?\nLike, their, their business, whatever residual, um, income is there.\nSo, like, like the last 12 months, their pre-tax income has been negative 6 billion, right?\nSo, like, they're, they're not, they're not an operating company that's selling SAS to people anymore.\nLike, that notion is kind of gone.\nUm, so yeah, like you can, you can perpetually raise equity and pay two or three employees to, you know, manage that business.\nYou don't need an operating business to do that.\nSo, it's really just more reflective of like this appetite from whoever these private investors are handing out, you know, 50 million, 100 million, 500 million, billion dollar checks to pick your favorite company who's going to go and bid BTC with it.\nYeah.\nAnd I think one of the most interesting things that came from the light speeded podcast is like there eventually will be a normalization of these SPVs trading at like different NAV premiums, right?\nLike, if you have, let's say two years from now, five Solana, you know, buy and hold treasury companies and one's trading at like a 10 mnav and one's trading at like a four.\nUm, I think those kind of things are obviously going to get very hairy for people.\nUm, and there's eventually, you know, I've long thought there's going to be activist investors, um, that that are going to come into these companies and try to break these things, right?\nAnd and force like an orderly liquidation for them.\nUm, this is like, this is like an activist's, um, dream type of transaction, right?\nOn a maybe, maybe MicroStrategy is too big at this point.\nUm, but if you have a company with a few billion BTC on its balance sheet and you can get it to a hold position in there, um, and take them, take them to court or get a, get a proxy war going on.\nUm, I think you can force them to liquidate if through a big enough nav premium.\nSo like in the longer term, do you eventually just kind of see consolidation amongst these types of companies?\nAnd also if any sort of like levered uh style ETF product like, you know, 3x leveraged BTC ETF or anything like that for any other token like hits the market, do you think the demand for these types of vehicles is also like greatly diminished?\nYeah.\nAnd there's like, there's, there's a whole hedge fund strategy of it's called closed-end fund activism, right?\nSo, so closed-end funds can trade at a discount or a premium, um, to NAV.\nAnd I'd argue like MicroStrategy is just a closed-end fund that's that's trading at a huge premium.\nUm, and you know, hedge funds can get together and and build a position and short short BTC on the side as a hedge and and you know, force shareholder votes and get these companies to liquidate themselves if the premium gets too out of whack.\nOne thing I also want to say is James, you mentioned that the amount of Bitcoin in the ETFs has doubled that of these treasury companies.\nI think the important piece is that since Q4 of last year, um, the treasury companies have been heavily outpacing ETF buyers, especially Q1, there was basically like no ETF flows and treasury companies bought a [ __ ] ton of Bitcoin.\nUm, we had a chart of that on our analyst hour call yesterday.\nActually, I sent it to Danny.\nI don't know.\nIt's a grainy screenshot.\nMaybe I'll send it in the 0xResearch chat, but that might be too much alpha.\nIt's um, I think they had outflows yesterday and they also had significant outflows last week from the B BTC ETFs.\nIt was like 350 mil last week at on one day.\nI can't remember what day and then yesterday it was 280 mil outflows.\nSo not great.\nUm, it is in a weird spot where there's clearly a lot of adoption.\naccoins into the Uber app.\nUm, but also on the other end, you you have like random companies spinning up to do treasury strategies, which is always like a little scary as if the price isn't going up as well makes you a little nervous.\nAnd I, I, I think with a lot of this stuff, like I really don't like to overthink it, right?\nLike a lot of times people are convinced that like these treasury companies have con, have like created some new kind of like financial alchemy.\nUm, and I hate, I really hate to use the grayscale analogy because like it's just to me it feels a little bit lazy.\nUm, but like there were people in 2020 like whose names will remain anonymous that were spinning up their own trust vehicles to do the own to do the same Grayscale trade, right?\nLike, like we actually have just seen this before, right?\nI mean, it's obviously very different.\nIt's a very different flavor.\nUm, but I remember back then all of the lenders saying, \"Hey, this is like this very exotic way to to juice returns and create revenue.\"\nUm, I don't know.\nI'm not going to say at the top or anything like that because I think that's a fool's game.\nBut yeah, I don't, I don't know.\nAt the end of this, I don't see Michael Sailor winning and him being, you know, the richest person on the planet and just continues to issue converts.\nBut who knows?\nMaybe I'm wrong.\nHere's that graphic Westie was asking about, and you can see the uptick in the public companies flows relative to the ETFs, um, and that flipping that happened between Q3 24 and then Q4 24 and then Q1 of this year where like Westie mentioned ETFs very little and a ton from these treasury companies and the ETFs picked back up Q2, but um, you know, these companies have been chugging.\nIt's also important to know that these Bitcoin flows, the ETF ones, a lot of them are delta neutral and they're shorting somewhere else.\nSo, it's like not really net overall, whereas the treasury companies are net.\nSo when it comes to like again, like they're the largest idiosyncratic buyers of Bitcoin, and if that starts to drop off in a meaningful way, that's not it's no bueno the Bitcoin price.\nDo you guys have that graphic?\nI'm going to try to find it.\nIt was, I think it came out two days ago.\nI think the Bloomberg guy retweeted it.\nUm, it was like the breakout of ETF holders by um, like investor type, and it was actually pretty good.\nI think it was like, I think the largest holder was actually um, RAAS, which is really good to see there.\nThere was obviously a ton of like RV hedge funds there, but there, there was a decent amount of um, RAAS there, which is good.\nI don't, I don't have it off hand, but yeah, let me pull that up.\nEric Belchunis shared this info.\nI think you're making a great point here.\nYeah, they, uh, he said, he mentioned previously that they were nowhere near Holy canoli.\nThey were nowhere near the top of this list and then just recently like have kind of jumped up the ranks.\nUm, so it is an interesting point to make that like, yeah, advisor has surged up the list now number one by a mile.\nThey make up 20% of total assets, but he said likely to rise another 354% as more adoption comes.\nI don't know.\nDo we have, we have broader thoughts there?\nLike, I mean, is the trend just continuing to trend?\nCould it really be that simple?\nI mean, are they just going to keep getting dumber and dumber with treasury companies?\nLike, are we just going to continue going out the risk curve and we're, well, I mean, I think if you to spoke to like, um, you know, people with the Bitcoin vision would say like, okay, now it's in the ETFs and like, now investment advisors are telling their clients to buy it, and you know, now funds are going to start making it part of their, you know, sample typical port, you know, options for like 401ks and other different, you know, investment vehicles that people are typically, you know, investing through, and maybe they're not even managing their own money.\nLike, is this really just a part of that process?\nLike, we're just, it, it's, it's achieved this like past the transition point of becoming a large enough and like meaningful enough macro asset, and then now that, you know, as it is at this point of the adoption curve where you just, you see these numbers that that Belchunis brings out, and you know, is it there's sort of some unstoppable thing here?\nIt's not quite the same as like when gold kind of had its, its big move, um, you know, maybe a decade or so or two ago, um, around like ETF, you know, inflows and people buying that.\nBut I don't know, I just wonder if there's like this, this broader trend that's just like kind of primed to play out now that the vehicles are out there and people are thinking this is a great place to park money.\nI mean, for the, for the most part, yeah, like this is, this is a ginormous macro trend and like over a long enough time horizon, Bitcoin is going up.\nLike, I don't know what else to say other than that.\nUm, yeah, that's all I got.\nI like the, I like the Jeff Park take of the 60/40 portfolio is dead, and he's like, you have to add Bitcoin into it.\nYou have to buy their ETFs.\nYou have to buy their ETFs.\nThat's his whole point.\nMakes a lot of sense coming from his angle.\nIt does make a lot of sense.\nYou have to admit.\nYeah.\nI think he's got no bias at all.\nWell, to be like, who's buying bonds?\nCan I, I'm like real question.\nDo you guys, anyone here own bonds in a meaningful allocation?\nWell, so like largest capital alligators on planet earth are buying bonds.\nThere's a very bigass, there's a very big difference between buying like when people are talking about the death of bonds, like there's a very different thing between being exposed to 30-year duration risk in US government bonds and then buying like five-year corporate paper or like short-term private credit.\nLike those are, those are very different things, right?\nLike corporate credit is not down 50% because of duration risk.\nUm, so I just think that that's like a very technical but an important point to think about.\nLike yeah, as a, as a 70-year-old pensioner, like having a decent percent of your portfolio in like five-year paper, I think is still very, very useful and very, very smart.\nYeah.\nBut if you bought Bitcoin with that money instead, you could retire your entire lineage.\nIt's very, very.\nYeah.\nBut the, the point of the point of buying bonds is like duration matching, right?\nSo you have some liability and you need to earn yield over the period at very low risk.\nSo like they serve a portfolio.\nLike that's why like I kind of, I'm, I'm kind of a hater on all like the death of bonds story.\nIt's like it, it really lacks nuance.\nUm, they're very useful, um, financial instruments.\nUh, perhaps, you know, they're not, they're less useful for retail or perhaps some of certain durations or risk characteristics are less useful for, um, a certain subset of retirees or whatever, but they're still like, they're not going anywhere, you know.\nThat's fair.\nYeah.\nI mean, I think as an industry and and probably also as a group here, we, I mean, we've got a younger bias here as well.\nSo the, you know, allocation to bonds is probably not the most important thing maybe at this stage of life, but I mean, James, you make great points.\nRyan, you make great points.\nThere's nuance there.\nAnd I think a lot of that gets, it gets skipped a lot because we like to get to the, you know, just allocate 50% to Bitcoin, you'll never lose type of, you know, the stuff that's all over the timeline.\nAnd and also like no one wants to own bonds when they're going down, of course.\nAnd like they, like from an annualized return perspective, like the Barclay Zag has not done well in this over the last, you know, whatever seven or 10 years due to the recent draw down, but like the next time we have a banking crisis, you're going to want to own 30-year bonds because the yield is going to plummet and you're going to get a lot of nice convexity there and it's going to protect your portfolio and we just haven't had that environment in a long time.\nYeah.\nOr I mean, you could just take ETH for the 2% as well instead of the bond.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBonds are bonds are too risky.\nSo I think we're going to opt instead for the six-month PT tokens of USDS.\nThat's what I'm saying.\nUm, Danny, what did you guys cover before I was introduced?\nYeah, we talked, um, talked a little bit of macro with Felix.\nWe talked a little bit about the Elon Trump crash out.\nI missed it.\nCircle.\nOf course, we can talk Elon Trump crash out.\nI think you covered the celus bit or no?\nNo, we did not.\nWe just covered one crash out.\nWe can cover other crash outs if you'd like.\nThere were more crash outs that occurred.\nCrash outs.\nUm, circle came up.\nMorpho and and and token structures.\nPump fund to an extent.\nDid we do pump fun already?\nBecause I feel like Ryan Connor, not quite.\nI'd be happy to discuss it in more detail.\nOn it.\nI, I did it already.\nHe said, \"Oh, I already did it on another pod, so we don't have to talk about it here.\"\nWhat do we think?\nFour bill 25%.\nSo, they're raising one bill at four bill.\n\n\nIs that a yes or is that a no?\nLike, you can put a meaningful percent of your portfolio in it.\nWould you do it or not?\nI mean, if it were trading at four times cash, you would, I think, you know, you would put a sizable percentage of your net worth into that thing that's extraordinarily cheap.\nI think the reality, the reason the valuation is so low is because the token's not getting all of the economics.\nThat's like clear.\nI think, but the problem is that the market doesn't like, only the people who participated or saw the deal know that.\nI don't think the broader market knows the details yet.\nSo I think it's much more likely that the, you know, the token gets a small portion of the economics, something that looks like Ato, that would make the valuation much more reasonable and fair.\nYeah.\nFor on, um, actually, I think this was posted on Zer chat by Daniel.\nThe rumor is that it's going to get 25% of revenue, which at that point would you say, yeah, this is decent or no?\nI think it's fair.\nYeah, I'm with I'm with Ryan.\nIt seems fair.\nI think you could look at the just the memecoin launchpad portion of it and call it pretty fair and look at the growth potential and the kind of dominance there and the live streaming, whatever community social app growth is like probably basically valued at zero today.\nUm, so you kind of get like an opportunity to long that.\nBut I agree with Ryan that like, you know, if there was just the token and there was no equity, then I think that would be a type of scenario where, I mean, I would certainly be very interested in allocating, but it's far different if only a portion of the revenue flows to the token and.\nYeah.\nAnd they might not raise the billion, right?\nThat's still TBD.\nYeah, that's a, it's a lot of money.\nI mean, that's like, you know, that's like crypto megaphone size.\nI think I think this is going to be a good test to see how much like idle liquid capital there is.\nIt doesn't even seem that crazy in the context of circle and bitcoin treasury companies soul treasury companies.\nLike I think if they ask for a billion, they will 100% get a billion.\nYou think they know they're 100% sure?\nI imagine they would know.\nThey wouldn't just go out and say, yeah, we might get a billion.\nI would be shocked if if they formally set an ICO for a billion.\nI would be stunned if they didn't fully fill it.\nYeah.\nI I I said before, like, gun to my head, I guess I would think that they raise it because I think that the appetite from funds is already way higher than I expected.\nUm, you know, we've seen, we've definitely seen funds over time warm to the meme, the memecoin market and pump as a business.\nUh, but it was only a handful.\nIt was an impressive to even get to a handful, but like clearly there's how much VC capital did they get?\nLike between 100, 300 million.\nLike it's more than I would have guessed.\nYeah.\nAnd think of like, think of how many think pieces came out within like two days on launchcoin and Pasternac and all that kind of stuff, like that is, if that's emblematic of how much liquid funds want to deploy, I think like, yeah, they'll, they'll, they'll ship it into pump fund with with no second thoughts.\nWes, you are unusually quiet.\nI feel, well, I was gonna, I was, I have something to say.\nSo, I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are on Pump Fund, like the quality of their cash flows and Pump Fund dominance as well within the sort of like memecoin trenches market.\nI personally think that their dominance has like basically peaked or or I don't think there's a lot of growth.\nThe problem with like their business model and their sector being in this like deep in the trenches of like crypto trading, the problem with being there is that the meta always changes.\nThe thing that people are trading always changes, uh, and the place that people are trading always changes.\nAnd so while it has been pumped on historically, I just I have a hard time seeing that like always being the case, that this sort of form factor continues to proliferate and you won't see new like launchpads come up with better incentive structures that eat away market share, uh, as well as just like different types of trading, like we're trading completely different stuff because the form factor always shifts.\nUm, so yeah, I'm curious your guys' thoughts on that.\nI I was gonna say I think this is like mitigated if the token is not locked when you buy it like on the public because I agree with you.\nI think we could see like a shift away from it.\nBut if the four bill public sale is just um, like at TGE you're not locked for a few years or like a year or whatever, I think it's it's a risk that you can probably take.\nBut if they're doing a two-year lock, three-year lock, whatever, even on like the public sale, then I agree with you.\nI don't think it's like even it might be worth considering.\nBut it's it's a risk that you have to take, um, with a team who will have already had made a lot of money to continue to dominate when we've seen that they're not, um, like there's actually bey competitors out now.\nUm, I don't think launch the Believe is one of them.\nI do think that Meteora and the Jupiter side might um end up taking some more market share.\nI do think I'll agree to an extent.\nI think they're more than ever before, there's higher likelihood of them being, you know, having their market share competed out away from them.\nUm, whereas in the past, I don't think people took them seriously enough for whatever reason.\nLike it was all the this is all ephemeral, this is all this that or the other thing, it's going to go away.\nLike Pump Fund's gone in 6 months and so there didn't seem to be like even a desire to compete really outside of like the few, you know, for me on BNB is hanging out and having a great time over there.\nCZ's, you know, pumping them.\nThat's great for them.\nUm, nobody else has really been keen to go after pump until just recently, like in the past few months.\nUm, so I'll say that like I think it's that's a higher risk now than it ever has been, but like I do think that they do still have a very meaningful network effect.\nLike we've seen a lot of these teams try to come in, you know, Radium kind of punching back after Pump Swap comes out and they drop their launch lab.\nThey do, you know, they have the partnership with Bonk and do Bonk fun.\nNot really much happening there.\nUm, same with Believe.\nLike James mentioned it, people were very excited.\nUm, it did a ton of volume really quick, like within a few weeks, um, and sort of had a very strong like blowoff there and I'd agree that there's an opportunity here to like pick on these like little subsectors that pump isn't really, they've not catered to anything specific, right?\nThey've remained like this kind of neutral any token, any meme, any whatever you want, like you can launch here, it's just one standard thing, like the formula is always the same, um, but I do think at some point leaving that completely vanilla does open this playing field a little bit more for something like a believe.\nYou know, maybe maybe they can still execute on it.\nThere's, you know, there's time.\nIt's only been a few weeks.\nIt's not like it's over forever.\nBut, um, if you can pick out these these subniches that maybe tokens of that type are not served so meaningfully on pump and like draw eyes and volume to your platform instead, I do think that is a risk for them.\nUm, though obviously they're leaning into the live streaming thing.\nLike maybe they don't really care that much about ICM and they really want to like bet on the kind of social app and like network effect that that that would come with it if let's say your platform is one sort of like a a Twitch or a Twitter type thing that also has the casino baked in.\nI mean, I think that would just be a very powerful business that would be hard to kind of like to compete with in the future if if if X or Twitter or whoever or YouTube was also the casino.\nI mean, that would be a very, very strong business and I think it would be incredibly hard to compete with them as like an incumb or as a new entrant coming into the space because they've got all the users there and then they've got the really like highly revenue generating and like eyeball popping stuff that the people are interested in doing.\nYeah, I think those are all really good takes.\nI think when I'm thinking about Pump Fun, I think the entire business is like premised on attention, right?\nLike you need to have people constantly launching these new new tokens and it's not entirely clear that's like people launching these tokens.\nLike I would imagine there's like a lot of bots that are like scraping the web and finding relevant news articles or like whatever cuz like no matter what, like there's always new tokens for whatever new meme and I think like being first to launch the new culturally relevant event token is like pretty probably um profitable.\nSo I imagine like that's a big part of their ecosystem that is kind of more in the shadows.\nUm, I do think like all these streaming stuff is also important, but um, on in terms of market share, I would hope that they use whatever new capital they raise to cement their market share and then continue to grow that as well.\nUm, so it's like if you were to think about what is like pump funds mo, I think it really is pronounced on like attention and network effects of that.\nUm, but those are kind of the two main things that I think about there.\nUh, I have a question.\nUm, well, I guess first to answer uh Wesley's question, I think it's all about whoever owns the front end.\nI think pump's going to get dis intermediated if they don't.\nUm, but question for the data team.\nUh, I believe so in preface, our data is always right and if it's wrong, we very quickly fix it because all the biggest liquid token funds rely on our data.\nUm, but the time series has changed uh for for uh trading volume that comes from external platforms for pump fun.\nI was looking at it like a few weeks ago and it was at 27%.\nNow like the time series has shifted and it's closer to 54%.\nAnd we haven't been at 207% for a while.\nSo like I don't know Westy, do you know who the data analyst responsible for the pump fund dashes and you know what they found because like they found a new contract that's um a new front-end contract that's driving volume to pump.\nIt's almost like there's this app called Axiom that does a ton of volume.\nWell, this included Axiom before, so it's not like it was, I I think they perhaps found a new smart contract or something.\nYeah, this is Jacob.\nDo you have a screenshot of the original?\nAnd you're talking about bonding curve volume, right?\nI probably have a screenshot of the original in my net new asset report.\nYeah, bonding curve volume.\nYeah, 7% makes sense of like total AMM volume of pup fund coins.\nWe do Ryan have two queries now by the way.\nOne is bonding curve specific and the other is this pump swap.\nAnd pump swap it's like 29%.\nAnd bonding curve is listed at 51 and it I don't though, right?\nWe've not always had the two.\nWe've not always.\nDo you know when we got the second one?\nI don't.\nBut that would could be a good sharp question.\nPretty closely after the AMM launch.\nYes, we've had for a while for a while.\nI was I'm going to agree with you as well though, Ryan.\nI think that's the other big piece here is they really need to own the front end.\nThey need to own their users.\nLike if Axiom can, if if this like assuming this data is very correct, you know, if Axiom and Photon and these other apps can can grow and grow and grow and they're doing 99% of the volume that flows to Pump Fun, then it's like a very different picture to Pump Fun having, you know, 50 or 60 or 70% of its volume originated directly on the platform.\nOr even if that's by bots that just directly interact versus, you know, some other app has the direct connection to all these users.\nYeah.\nSo, confirm that it has changed.\nUm, I do have a screenshot of the historical.\nI'm I'm sending them along now to the group.\nJames, any thoughts?\nMr. No, you lost me.\nYou lost me a data front end.\nThis is not my forte.\nI'm going to share something as well that is also a bit of a change up, um, that maybe folks aren't expecting and maybe we'll need to, you know, double check and confirm with triples as well, but uh, he's got some new charts cooking on the deck side of things showcasing market share and uh for me on BNB is like really a player in this space if I'm being honest.\nPump Fund has been the dominant uh memecoin or just general like sort of launchpad and recently this like run uh that B&amp;B is having is really rocketing for memes dominance, which is interesting.\nNow, I don't know that there's a lot of like user or customer crossover between for meme and like pump fun today or even like between B&amp;B and Solana, but maybe that changes if uh all of the hottest tokens start launching over there.\nDo we um, can we go, can we look at the absolute number?\nYeah, I I think I I I do you guys know how much I love the market share charts, but I do believe that in like very low um as the cost to participating in these things gets like really, really low, I feel like the absolute numbers for like launching tokens, launching individual tokens like matters more.\nOh, so sorry.\nThis is a this is a volume number.\nYes.\nGotcha.\nOkay.\nThey're doing several hundred million as well.\nThey're, you know, not, you know, they weren't really even in the picture, but they they had a prior sort of move back in in March.\nThere was, you know, sort of a previous memecoin boom when CZ was talking about his dog and all that stuff, and that actually was like a massive amount of volume for them.\nUm, and then recently again, and I think some of this, you know, I there's been a lot of talk like what's happening on B&amp;B, what's happening with Pancake Swap.\nUm, our friend of the show, friend of the of 0xResearch and Blockworks, Tumilelet, shared some details in the Telegram the other day as well.\nThere's some trading campaigns going on with certain tokens on on BNB chain.\nUm, and that's spurring a lot of activity, basically select assets have, you know, volume related incentives associated with them right now.\nSo people are trading those, then they get, you know, brought over.\n\n\nto Binance Alpha and then\nBinance Alpha is kind of like a site\nline of sight to getting listed on the\nexchange.\nSo it's driving a lot of user activity.\nMaybe this is reflective of that.\nYou know people are just they're hoping to hit, you know, the new hottest meme that does a thousand x because CZ talks about it.\nBut um there's no reason that train has to stop if they want to keep promoting tokens in the ecosystem.\nWell, it seems like it's pretty inorganic, right?\nOr no, counter.\nI don't know how to make it.\nWait, guys.\nI want to do kind of a segue into the protocol.\nOne sec.\nClarifying on the data.\nUh, the reason why it was different is because we tagged more Axiom wallets that other sources had not found.\nAnd that's probably I don't know if you saw some charts circulating uh X yesterday of like supposedly a huge drop off of Axiom volume, but it's likely because these accounts didn't fully tag the the amount of Axium wallets that exist.\nSo that's why there's a change.\nJust want to clarify for the audience, but go ahead, Boccaccio.\nThanks, Weston.\nUm, I wanted to bring up I wanted to bring up the protocol.\nNo, he left.\nI wanted to bring up the protocol um that Ethereum released and their like treasury thing.\nDid you guys look into it?\nI know Danny and Ryan Connor are immediately going to say, \"I didn't look into it.\nThey're dead in the water.\"\nBut Westie, I'm hoping that you may have looked into the protocol thing and might be able to actually speak on it a little bit.\nLooked into what?\nWhat are you talking about?\nThe blog post from like three days ago.\nOh, like they're firing the research and development team, bringing everybody under Dankrad.\nIn fact, we didn't talk about this, right, ever?\nI don't think so.\nWe don't know like too much of the details other than what they've publicly announced which is basically they're hunkering down.\nThey're like changing around having specific teams focus on their specific outcomes of choice of scaling the L1 scaling blobs uh and UX improvements and they're putting people in place in each of those categories to lead the charge and then Dankad is overseeing all of those teams.\nThat was the key piece that I read.\nHonestly skimmed over the rest.\nUh, but that was a key piece for me of like, okay, they're they're they're having, again, it's at this point it's still all talk, but the talk is way better than it was six months ago, and everything they're saying is the right thing, and they're approaching things in the right way.\nAnd Dankrad leading the charge.\nI love uh because I've always loved, you know, his contributions to Ethereum research and also, you know, his opinions and how he views things, his work ethic.\nUm, so I'm yeah, I'm a big Dankrad fan.\nSo happy to see him leading the charge.\nDo you agree that all you you you specifically said that everything they're doing and from a comm's perspective right now is correct?\nDo you actually believe that?\nWell, no.\nLike from a from a process standpoint.\nUm, so my assumption also with this is that they're like firing people, restructuring, and this is how they're restructuring.\nUh, like I wouldn't say it's like like if I were to give it a grade, it's definitely like an A minus.\nIt's not perfect.\nLike it's great.\nYeah.\nDo you think they're going to be less opinionated on use cases in the future?\nLike do you think they're going to ever be as agnostic as Solana for example or like on what level how close to that will they be?\nI don't think they'll be fully agnostic.\nI do think Vitalic in the past being like weird about DeFi.\nLike I don't think that's going to be a thing.\nI think they're going to very much prioritize DeFi on the L1.\nUh, and they're, yeah, I think they're going to be somewhat opinionated of like these are the type of use cases we want on the L1 and it's going to be mostly DeFi focused, but yeah, I mean, I feel like you have to be somewhat opinionated, although for the most part agnostic.\nLike, you don't want to be the chain that's known for like uh, tornado cash and like North Korea coming to your chain, right?\nLike there's some amount of curation you want to do, but for the most part, you should be pretty open to like whatever people want to build.\nMy thing here is that I feel like every four months, Ethereum does one good like comms thing and then everyone's like, \"Holy [ __ ] Ethereum's [ __ ] back.\nSoul is dying.\"\nStill all talk, right?\nIt's like they haven't done anything different really.\nDid you see that arrow that says next year it's going to be a global reserve currency?\nFrom the Banklist podcast.\nI I think just like I have the same view that I did three months ago, four months ago, five months ago when these talks started where it's like, yeah, we put together a new group of people.\nWe we put a new person in.\nWe got a new person in.\nThese are the new missions.\nLike just ship a product update a little faster than you have in the past.\nScale the thing a little faster than you have before like you say you're going to and then like I'll be more positive about it.\nBut until like until the announcement is like, okay, we scaled blobs by X instead of, you know, half of X like we were originally going to, then it's just like, all right, we're waiting until they ship a hard fork in a shorter amount of time than they plan.\nLike it's still all talk.\nLike they need to ship.\nIt's a bit weird, too, that like no one who is building an application that is used on the chain seems highly opinionated about the chain's future.\nLike any like who who's the most opinionated DeFi builder in your guys opinion?\nHave you seen someone who like continuously speaks out on what the direction of Ethereum?\nThat's like the main thing that's used.\nMark Zeller.\nDoes he speak out on the chain itself though or just like a No, he just says use a Yeah.\nAnd like that's great, but like you know like I think there's a there's a really compelling DeFi use case happening on Ethereum.\nLike actual DeFi usage outside of like trading is you know much much larger on Ethereum than it is on Salon or anywhere for that matter.\nAnd you have no opinionated devs showing up in Discourse around the chain's future which is just kind of crazy because it's like they're using your product.\nIt's like it's just bizarre.\nIt's just so so strange.\nI feel like this is uh something that has come as a result of in the past Ethereum Foundation never talked to application developers.\nLike your your biggest DeFi founders are like, \"Yeah, I never talked to the EF until like many years after I founded this thing and it had billions in TVL.\"\nI think that's just a result of them not like the Ethereum Foundation and App Builders not being close at all and feeling like there's no mode of communication.\nHopefully that changes recently and I feel like there are some uh bigger D5 founders like Kane I feel like has been pretty vocal about here are Ethereum's problems and was also like took a leap of faith building on Salana with Infinex and being like this is an okay approach to scaling where like most ees would like never even speak of Salana and you also have like Leshner I'd say has like thrown some criticisms here and there not anything too harsh, but I'd say like app founders for the most part are making themselves known.\nUm, but it's yeah, few and far between.\nI think a result of the past relationship between app developers and EF.\nYeah, we got a couple months and then Christine Lagarde and everyone the ECB will be will be adopting ETH.\nSo, it looks like we're on track.\nI think soon.\nUm, one thing about ETH that I always feel like is kind of relevant is most teams and protocols, um, they create a foundation and they don't really rely on the foundation that much.\nIt's just there.\nVersus Eve, I feel like really works with the foundation all the time.\nAlmost like they didn't realize that it should not be making all of the decisions.\nIs this correct or am I being like I feel like in most teams it's like the labs that's like actually making the decisions versus ETH is like the foundation right I so when the the you know when the media push for ETH the ETH the the so-called ETH pivot started um I dove back into ETH media and listened to a bunch of hours worth and all any any EF person who was doing official comms on a pod like I I listened.\nUm the interesting takeaway is that their framing of decision-m over time um like differs from what the market thought it was.\nYou know, I think the narrative was that ETH decision-making for a long time was too decentralized and disorganized, right?\nLike our decentralization was too good and we got in our own way.\nBut um I think it was um Tamas and perhaps Donrod or other important people in that ETH core.\nThey specifically said that decision-m would happen from Vitalic with two or three other people in a telegram group and now they're going to be now they're going to get more opinions before they move on things.\nSo they actually had a very highly centralized decision-making process that did not go well for the community.\nUm from you know end of 21 to present and now they're they're actually telling you that they're going to get more decentralized and consider more opinions in their decision-making.\nSo it's actually the opposite the opposite of what the market thought was going on and they're telling you it's they're actually telling you that's going to get worse.\nIt's pretty crazy.\nYeah.\nYeah, when you put it that way cuz like definitely there can be a lot of benefits from highly opinionated people making decisions when it's like you're not really taking any other ideas in consideration.\nBut maybe they just like weren't super opinionated or I have no idea what was causing them to, you know, stall like they were before.\nBut, you know, thanks for doing your DD there, Ryan.\nI'm sure there's a lot of mental trauma that you're now, you know, having to deal with.\nAnd so I mean just really put yourself through it for for the community there, man.\nI I think No, I I think that ETH podcasting is like fantastic.\nThey've been doing it for the longest amount of time.\nLike they're super high quality conversations.\nLike Yeah.\nSorry, Bach.\nLike it's just it's fantastic over there.\nThe water's warm.\nLike they're very very good.\nVery good.\nAnd it's entertaining.\nAnd if like if you if you are really into just like philosophical musings, like no one does it better.\nIt's really entertaining.\nI could do it all day.\nYeah.\nYeah, but what's the point of all that?\nNo offense.\nLike at the end of the day, like it becomes a bit like not boring, but like show me, right?\nLike it's been it's been 10 years.\nLike I feel like just sitting here and having philosophical conversations is fine, but it's not if it's not productive, then there's no real point.\nYou know what I mean?\nAnd that's what the market's telling them, right?\nIt's like it's not productive.\nAnd even this time, they're not believing it.\nUm, it's easy to be academic and pontificate when you're when you basically have a monopoly and there's very little competition.\nBut as soon as you have competition up your legs, that's where you do what they're doing now, which is, oh, oh [ __ ] And like hunker down, restructure, wartime.\nAt least I mean that's what they should be doing.\nAnd it sounds like that's what they're doing.\nDo do you think they never realized that it was valid competition until now?\nJustin Drake on a bankless podcast when Salana had more rev than ETH being like, \"Oh, it's over.\nEast one.\"\nLike he literally said that verbatim.\nYeah.\nI think they never viewed other smart contract platforms as their competitor and only viewed Bitcoin as their competitor.\nI don't think they were looking backward at all.\nI think they were looking forward and like like to your point they were the incumbent so I think that makes sense but I think it's definitely a mistake um for them to have like picked Bitcoin as the only competition and I do think it only really started to kind of actually you know gain a lot more momentum across the crowd when you saw other metrics pop up that Salana was doing much better on uh versus Ethereum.\nSo, I totally agree.\nAnd I just don't think like you can't you can't be that opinionated and win, right?\nLike I think trading meme coins and like gambling is like pretty dumb.\nI do it a lot of it.\nI think it's stupid.\nBut like that is the market.\nLike if you want to sit there and and yell at the market and say it's wrong for six years in a row and you should be focusing on more serious endeavors, like back to the philosophical point, yeah, you can do that.\nBut like that's not what people want.\nSo like too bad.\nLike the market tells you what it wants, build it.\nYou can be opinionated and win.\nYou just need to be right.\nLike otherwise you need to let the markets do it do its thing.\nYeah.\nInteresting.\nI I think there are a lot of problems with the recent comms.\nOne um and I guess that um Darren from our team pointed out that someone in uh in one of like the ETH um monthly meetings or something like recently brought up fees, but in all those hours of ETH official media comms that I listen to, they did not once mention the word revenue, which is a problem and is the fundamental reason why the ETH token is lower is because its revenue has fallen 95% from peak.\nSo, it's not a surprise to me that the token's like whatever 50% from peak.\nUm so they still fundamentally don't understand the the value driver for the token.\nUm I think the other issue is that you know just a few days ago Vitalic was at a conference and said Devx is more important than UX and I don't know that was clickbait.\nI'll clarify it was a clickbait clip.\nThey were asking about a very niche specific thing of like in this specific ZK type of design system he thinks that right now today the devx is more important because it's so early stage I got baited too don't worry gotcha okay so I stand corrected but like if you were to I mean what's okay so yes I am wrong got click baited what would the evidence tell you though\n\n\nLike that they think because I don't know. I, I think that the evidence suggests that UX is still of little fundamental importance. Yeah. I mean, they, they hate the users, Ryan. It's like you always say, I agree with you. It, it just, it's been a worse experience for a long time. I think like the, the Ethereum wallet experience, like the transaction signing experience, like a lot of pieces, and like it's gotten much better than it was in the past. You know, there are better wallets today than there were a few years ago. Uh, Rabbi's quite good for an ETH wallet. I'm sure there's others. Um, and there's other kind of, obviously, there's lots of other parts to the stack and what the user experience is, but, uh, it really has not iterated as fast as I think that they should have been. I don't know why that was like not so much of a care for these teams. I guess launching like the 50th L2 was more important. Well, like also think about our, I mean, this is interesting. Think about our pump fund conversation where we're constantly saying like, hey, they have to, they have to own the front end. ETH has totally given up the front end. Uh, the centralized exchanges favor their own native chain. Uh, the wallets are no longer solely ETH wallets and don't, and in, in many cases, don't default to ETH. Um, you know, ETH is not the, you know, um, it's not the favorite chain on Phantom. It's not the favorite chain on Coinbase Wallet. It's not the favorite chain of Coinbase. So ETH is very much fallen further away from the user, and, um, so maybe UX doesn't matter.\n\nI, I will say UX is distinctively one of the core pillars of their future visions. You have scale on scale blobs and UX improvements. So that is like one of the things they're working on. Is it too late? I think is an important question. Like, yeah, there's so many UX issues, like too many to name, really, with Ethereum, the EVM, etc.\n\nSo, like, obviously, they haven't prioritized in the past, but it sounds like they're going to. Again, all talk. We'll see. On your revenue piece, Ryan, have you read the Cyber Fund ETH thesis? I think that's like the most grounded Ethereum thesis I've probably read yet of anything. Definitely. What is their significance though?\n\nUm, well, the, the, um, the founders of Cyber Fund were like Lido OGs, like Ethereum OGs, like very much involved in like governance and, uh, etc. of Ethereum.\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that the fact that they, that their priority of scaling the blob market, which is in a way, um, contradictory to scaling the L1, right? Because the two are competitive with one another. You're supporting L2s, but then you're also saying that we want execution on the L1. Um, they still fundamentally, I don't think they know, it's, it's not a clear, um, they're not prioritizing, in fact, execution fees on the L1 if you're scaling blobs, right? You're helping out the L2s, which are effectively your competitors for execution fees. You can do both at the same time, like there's no reason. I mean, maybe with like capacity constraints and how quickly you scale, but in theory, you should be able to like add more blob capacity while also increasing the gas limit. Yeah, you could, you could do both, but if you were, um, if you were focused on maximizing revenue, you would help your, you would, you would solely focus on that thing, right? Because scaling blobs is going to help L2s get market share faster than you. Yeah. And I, I think part of that, like their piece was scaling the L1 will bring revenue back. I think that like the other piece that they really focused on was solving interrop.\n\nUm, and like, yeah, revenue generated from that is sort of a bigger question mark, but that's like, I think that's like scaling blobs and having more people post DA because DA is super valuable because you get some interop standards from it, and then they can charge a higher price for that DA because of those properties. I'm not saying I completely buy the thesis. I, I just, I understand like where they're coming from, and at least in the piece, they talked a ton, like they used a ton of Blockworks Research data and did talk about like revenues and like ultimately at the end of the day, how much value is ETH accruing, whereas like you never hear that really on other ETH podcasts or ETH media. Yeah, it'd be nice if you, if it'd be nice if you heard, um, whoever's in charge of the EF mention revenue. They actually brought, like, I was listening, it was like John Charb, I think, on Bankless with one of the guys from the EF, and they all brought it up and all laughed about it, and they all chatted about it, like, very quickly, the Rev debate, and Tomas didn't, wouldn't, didn't say anything. He's like, I think he specifically wanted to stay away from it because of how the community might react. That's just me reading the tea leaves. Kind of a weird thing to do. Um, guys, should we also shed on Solana a bit or focus on the rest? Let's, let's open it up. What, what do we want to talk about? What, what's interesting right now? Hyperl is a big one. What other like tokens, narratives, trends are we looking at? Maybe this is a little bit of a trench talk on Friday. What are we interested in chat?\n\nI think, I think to go bear mode. I think he wants to, that is not, I'm not going bear mode. Want to say he's got something to get off his chest. I don't have anything to get off my chest. I am happy in the tokens that I own, and that's it. I, I did sell my Solana, just FYI to people. Um, that's the third time we've heard that this year. I just, I just have to say it out. Never buys back in, but always fully sells. I fully sold, I fully sold, not fully, I sold it. I'm unhappy with, with its performance. I've instead opted to buy other tokens that only go up as opposed to go down. Yeah. And what tokens, like selling into weakness? Is that part of the strategy? Uh, yes. In fact, anytime I get slightly emotional, I don't look at numbers, revenue, anything. I just look at as, holy [ __ ], this might go down. I got to sell it. What's the quote? It was going down precipitously. I don't know who wouldn't sell. Exactly. Exactly what I do. Um, I get really nervous about it, and then I just, holy [ __ ], I need to get the [ __ ] out of this. Sometimes I do TA. James Kristoff really helps me out. He has this VWAP strategy that is unreal. He needs to explain it out.\n\nUm, but yeah, I mean, that's, I wanted to talk about Solana's weakness, but I guess we can't do that because Danny wants. Did you sell just because price was down more than? No, I s, we can talk about Soul. I just want to talk about, you know, we talked about ETH. Let's talk about, I'm just trying to dive in of like, okay, soul, why? Because it was going, I just don't think that it's, I think there are other L1s. I'm not going to show them. I think there are other L1s that might do better in the medium to long term and that have been doing better in the medium to long term. Um, and I think that the soul's returns may not be, I don't, I'm not bearish on it as an asset. I just think there might be better things to buy. Um, is my, is my take. I'm very happy to be wrong. Um, because that would mean that you guys are winning, which is more important than me winning.\n\nYou're so selfless. I am. I'm very, very nice guy. But I, I largely agree, actually. I think Soul will likely underperform, um, newer chains. Um, I think, I mean, I already said, I think I have some question marks on Pump Fund's dominance, and I just think like people want a new game to play, and the Salon game to me feels like it, it happened. It's super saturated, and so like I think the likelihood that we see a new game elsewhere is like the highest it's been yet. So it's kind of a general thesis, and no, it's not like I'm looking at specific data and making that. It just feels like, like if there were a new game, that it would pop up somewhere else.\n\nI mean, isn't that, so, okay. What do you think about this push back where, um, I, I, I just think that that's kind of like backward-looking, like what's happening in crypto is very different from what's happened historically, where like in crypto, like you could argue like it was like a fixed capital environment. You had the same players moving assets around and chasing the same returns and trying to do that new game, whereas now you have a new, a new source of capital coming into these markets. Um, now that crypto is legal, legal in the US, and you have, um, regulatory clarity in both the US, uh, and Europe. So, like, like why we said earlier that, you know, a new game is always played. Um, but I'm, I'm particularly bullish on incumbents because these are network effects businesses, and capital is going to go to where there's liquidity, um, especially professional capital.\n\nSo to me, there's like two different pools of capital. There's the professional capital, and there's the DGEN capital. And to me, Pump Fund and a lot of like the Salana volume is the DGEN capital. And to me, yeah, like most of the new money entering the space is this like professional capital, which is that's what's bidding like the Circle IPO. Um, and like the DJ capital to me is always looking to be early to the new thing, and like is mixed in with like CT and K's of like sort of creating self-fulfilling prophecy of what the new thing is. And so to me, it's like, are you really early to this Salana pump fun game? Is there really active liquidity because people know what the game is? To me, it's like the DJ Capital feels like it's going to go elsewhere.\n\nYeah, I guess you could argue that like 70% of Salana activity is that, yeah, 50 to 70%. The counterargument here is that Solana is, I think the user base that Solana's in attracting is actually very different to what we've had historically, and it's like 18 to 19 year olds with a Phantom wallet and some Salana. It's always been, huh? Were you trading in 2021? That was literally the same thing. It was like 23 year olds who are buying these like third grade DeFi protocols on like your fifth L1. It's the same thing. It's a different game. Yeah, fair enough. Good point. That's just like something that's always in my mind is, is there an extra group of people that I'm not indexing for that I'm not thinking about? I feel like that's the one that I'm not. Yeah. I think it's natural that like, I mean, the fun, the silly fun games, that's indexes lower on the age group. Like it's not surprising that a lot of the consumer experiences appeal to the 20-year-olds and the Gen Z's and the millennials, and then like the idea of like, you know, just earning some yield on dollars is maybe, you know, maybe that percolates up the, the age demographics a little more easily than like gambling on a random token ticker. But I, I, I think I agree with your point to an extent here, Westie, of like, in my head, I do like the idea of trying to find a bet on if, if the next, maybe the next game is Pump One live streaming. Who knows? Like it could be, or if it's something else tang, tangentially related to like the stuff that already, you know, we had meme coins and NFTs and just dexes, and then now launchpads, and like if there is like a slightly modified app that has a token and I can bet on that, and like with Salana's market share and pump's market share and hyperlquid's market share where it is today, like sure, you can bet on growth, but I mean, I think you do have a point here, it's like, you know, you can apply some, some growth number to that and and look for those returns. But there, this space, I, what I think for me has always attracted me and what's always interesting is that there are just like constantly these like 0 to 100 opportunities where nobody's using something, and then all of a sudden it's the hottest app, and it's making $500 million a year, and if you have the opportunity to get in on that thing, um, you know, that's what I find exciting, and so, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if, if something else pops up that's not pump fun and is, you know, you see the headlines in a year or two years that are like, this new app got to 100 mil ARR in three days, and it's a crypto app.\n\nIf you guys liken memecoin trading to like sports gambling as kind of like a crude analogy, how much bigger do you think the opportunity is to expand memecoin trading compared to like, if I just very crit, like the market caps of the, of the top publicly traded, um, sports gambling and like, you know, online blackjack companies, like how much larger is the TAM for for memecoin trading, and like, are we actually already saturated there? And one thing like I did mention this that I think is interesting, Westy, I talked to you about this and put it in the, um, Blockworks Research subscriber chat, like asking for a dashboard that looks at the median, call it like peak market cap for an onchain, call it runner, for lack of better words, and how that changes over time. And like, obviously, I think everyone would agree right now, the market feels like super weak where something might run to five million bucks and then completely die, whereas five months ago, it could, you know, that could have ran to 100 million bucks on chain. Just curious what you guys think about that.\n\nUh, I think that there's a solid chance that the TAM for memecoin gambling is larger on an annual basis. It already does more volume than traditional gambling in the aggregate. Um, the only difference is the profitability of pun is of pump is lower than that of DraftKings. Uh, I don't exactly understand why, but I have to look into that. I guess the spread's larger on DraftKings.\n\nUm, I think that, um, the risk there is that the memecoin game is too opaque. So, the nice thing about sports gambling is that it's, you, you very clearly understand when you win or lose. You can bet on the game. You can bet on the overunder, you can bet on the next pitch, you can bet on individual points scored, rebounds, whatever. But on meme, a lot of on meme coins, it's the, um, it's a little harder to understand how you win. And perhaps that is a bare case for the TAM being larger. But I think just very simp, simplistically, um, I think that meme coins increase fun and minimize the, um, barriers to multiples on capital, like, like sports gambling, like I don't think comes close. So that would be my reasoning for why I think the TAM's bigger. Yeah. To\n\n\nTo your point of like, the opaqueness of memecoin trading and the difference of sports gambling, like I, I liken it to, right? I think we're probably at peak saturation for sports gambling in the United States, right? I don't think it's going to expand as a percentage of people that participated in it that much. Um, and yeah, you of course do have professional bettors and sharps that are in the market. I think the difference between a sharp in sports gambling and just your average college kid who's betting on sports is very, very different than if we 10x the TAM of memecoin trading on Solana. You're going to have extremely, extremely sophisticated participants, even more so than are in the market today that are going to come in. And I think convers, like it's an inverse relationship. You're actually going to get a worse user experience for your average person who's punting on chain because they're going to get ripped off by actual, you know, guys at Jane Street that are now trading on Pump Fun because the TAM is 10 times larger. Like, I think your experience is actually going to get worse the bigger it gets.\n\nYeah, I mean, you have sports gambling is pretty professionalized too, right? Um, I have talks on the board and he used to do it professionally day-to-day. I don't know. No, but your win rate as a sharp is very different than your win rate professionally bundling coins on Pump Fun. That, that's the point. Very, very different. Yeah. And think about like who your counterparty is and how you win in a certain scenario. Like if you're gambling, your counterparty is these, like the books basically, unless you're doing some like prediction market. Like you're gambling against these other people that are running statistical models. And so the idea is to like bake out a small amount of edge that compounds over time. And your counterparty with memes are like you're like dumb retail trader. And the way you win is you're just early. And so what that means is the game gets saturated when people realize you make the most money spitting out tokens and like causing them to go viral. And at the end of the day, like no one wants to be the exit liquidity for these like token farms. And so like the game itself is set up for people to lose way more, like your average person. I, I think that's fair, but I, I still think there's an opportunity for like, you know, Ryan did his net new assets right up. And I think like there is an opportunity for more of these like categories to unfold here where, I mean, we've kind of seen bits and pieces there where like just the core launching memes, which a lot of it is either news type content or it's like who can come up with just the funniest thing in the moment based on a reaction to something. Um, and then maybe fight, fight, fight against the other 16 launches that are trying to do the exact same joke. Um, but you know, if you can, the live streams is one question mark, right? Can you tie a token to content creators? Are people interested enough, are like audiences interested enough to like bet on the mind share or like the growth or like the virality potential of a creator that they like? You know, internet capital markets is another one. Like, is getting web two startup tokens on chain like something interesting enough and durable enough that people want to like bid those up consistently? I think there's other opportunities for like these different sort of plays on the same idea where the game is can be different from how it is in the past where, you know, in ICM, there's not, there can't be 10 tokens for the one business, right? Because there's the one business and the one business launches the token and the same goes for, you know, the content creator, right? So you don't, you get rid of some of those issues. Um, and there's, so there's different ways to kind of maybe play some of these categories that could unfold, which might lead to, you know, some of that additional TAM expansion. But these are all, I mean, they're relatively unproven still, right? Like Believe had kind of a little bit of a blowoff moment. The streams, they're, they're not doing much today, but they're, they're definitely leaning into it. They want to incentivize it. Um, we'll see if other categories can like draw that attention.\n\nGet a haircut.\n\nI did. I did, but he kind of [ __ ] up the front. I look like 1010, if you guys know who that is.\n\nLike a kid.\n\nDo you guys think the, uh, I mean, the trenches feel back to me, like it's getting, it's getting easier to make money.\n\nWhy aren't you sharing these opportunities with me, Ryan? Yeah, I, I don't know if I agree. I thought it felt good like a month or two ago. Feels a little different today. There's, there's always pockets where things are fun and it feels like the time windows have shrunk of these pockets. What do you think the catalyst for like the trenches doing well is? Because I feel like it's always just like a runup in like SOL, the native asset, or like some, I don't know. Yeah, I'll leave it open. What do you guys think?\n\nI think it's days like yesterday where a viral social media moment happened and you can look at the numbers. You got a big spike in memecoin launches and trading volume yesterday. Just looks kind of off the charts. Um, which is why I think yesterday was so good. Everyone just wanted to find the next thing.\n\nYeah, but even yesterday there were like tokens that I feel like before if this happened, we would have like 15 to 20 runners in a week. Um, yeah, like we didn't even talk, there was no Celkus token, no Peter Chef token, you know, there was just like one or two. There was a Crash Out token that didn't go up a lot. It's, it was just a weird, like it's not how it used to be if that makes sense, where it was like there would be like 25 of them and then like the, and also like before it would be like everything would hit 15 to this is just like very normal though, you know, like it's, it's overindustrialized now and it's becoming more and more like there's a billion tokens out instead of a million tokens out, which means that things don't go up as much and when things don't go up as much, people are like, they're wary, they don't really want to buy, the attention doesn't go up as much as it used to, which I think is fine because Pump Fun still makes money. So for Pump Fun, it doesn't really [ __ ] matter because there's a billion tokens that are doing 10,000 volume each instead of a million tokens that are doing whatever the math is in that case volume each. So to them, it doesn't matter. But overall, something we can, something news that we can [ __ ] on. Um, Gemini filed for an IPO. So can we, can we, um, discuss how low valuation they're going to get?\n\nI want to talk about box thing. So, first of all, it's actually not in Palm's best interest. Sorry, Chris. And the same. We'll get back to the Gemini. James, we're gonna get back to you. Westy is gonna [ __ ] on me and then we're gonna [ __ ] on Gemini and then we're going to end it. I'm sorry, James. Yeah. Yeah. Like that's just going to be like, we're just, yeah, that's whatever. Um, yeah. It's like a casino, right? Like people, like casinos love when when people win big and promote that big win because then it, it really draws people in and they win on the totality of like, in the long run, they're going to take their cut and so more the more people betting the better. It's the same for Pump Fun. It's like if there aren't runners that are going to crazy valuations, then you have less people trading the tokens, which means less people launching the tokens and it's like a whole reflexive loop. So I don't agree with that piece. Uh, and like in terms of the original question, to me, it's like a function of both liquidity and like exciting events or things happening. So yesterday was like the exciting things and events happening, but there's not much liquidity to me in the trenches right now compared to like November, December of last year. Like that to me was like all, like the trenches were, were booming then, whereas like yesterday, like Box said, it's like you had maybe a couple runners and they like, they detracted so fast. So to me, the trenches are not really that back. I, I think that there's a curation problem very obviously, like I think there needs to be some automate, some automated mechanisms to just like filter out for like bad bubble maps. Um, because now like, like the Axiom feeds pretty dog [ __ ]. I think, I think it's full of things that you know, you might not want to, like you need a, you need, you need, you need an aggregator to curate the experience to, um, uh, make discovery a more pleasant experience.\n\nYeah, I, I think I agree with this point, Ryan, and I, and right today the model or the design is like you go to Axiom or Photon meme scope or wherever and it's like all the filters are available, right? You, you could filter out all of the things that you want to filter out, right? Like anything that's got more than, you know, 20% supply held by one address or how much is bundled, et, you know, etc. You can, you can ignore all that stuff, but the fact that you know, it's, it still plays into the same dynamics, right? Like if not everyone is doing that and there's still people buying those other tokens, like it doesn't really like directly address the problem that you know, you're still going to get all those bundled launch tokens that you know, suck a little bit of the flow that would have maybe gone elsewhere if there was a little bit more of a curated experience. Um, and it seemed like it, at least in the short term, was exciting enough for Believe. I don't know what the best way for Pump Fun to do that is though. Like at least with live streams, there's, you know, it's curated in the sense that like if Aiden Ross or Anom or whoever Gainzy has a stream token, it's like there's just that one token, right? It's if they show the live stream on the platform, there's the one token associated with it, right? Like that's straight up curation from like how many views their stream gets or what have you. And there's nothing else really to do there. But yeah, with the, with the news type content, it's, I mean, that's it's harder. Can we talk about Believe like super specifically just for like five minutes?\n\nWesty, is that okay? Yeah. He doesn't want to talk about Gemini now. I want to talk about Believe.\n\nIs that signed off?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Go ahead. So, do you, do you, would you guys agree or disagree that it's done at this point? Like he missed his window of opportunity and like the entire thing is cooked.\n\nI said, \"Sorry, Ryan. I don't agree.\" I don't agree either. I don't agree.\n\nBoach, did you agree? I, I think he'll pastor Knack mode is very much a thing, but I think for the time being it's like he needs to come out with a V2 product and that needs to be good. My only thing is that in crypto if a chart, it's, it's more difficult to come back because your kind, your product is kind of reliant on your chart. He could come back, but I think it might make more sense for a competitor to launch that is a V2 that is much better. Like I said this on the pod and Ryan called me an idiot because he was like, that's very obvious, but the V2 is always better than the V1, like the shift is so dramatic and I feel the V2 era of, um, god forbid. He did this crazy take that the next gen of products are always better than the previous gen. Update two is better than update.\n\nRight? Like I feel like that's a decent take. It's like a good head. Have you seen the chart?\n\nNo. Is the chart good? It doesn't look that bad. That's fine. But, but I just think his, like his window of opportunity, he just refused to realize, like it's crypto. You need to ship stuff within like two days. There's no like, hey, we're going back to the drawing boards and we'll be back in two and a half weeks with an update. Like he had some like serious, serious momentum, right? Like when Launchcoin was big for that first like five days or so, like that mind share was [ __ ] crazy, right? Like that's all I was thinking about. I know a lot of you guys were super in, like super involved in looking at those coins too. And like he just lost that within like two days by being way too slow. And to your point, Boach, of like V2, yeah, V2 is better than V1. He could have just launched like a shittier version of V2 and like it would have been fine. But like if he just did something, like even if it was an incremental game, it would have been something versus him just like randomly replying to tweets and being like, \"Yeah, we're going to think about this and take it into consideration.\" Like he just wasn't playing to his audience.\n\nYeah, I agree. You do have to ship. I mean, you have to ship really, really fast when you have the attention on you. That's, I, I would definitely agree with that take, but I don't think he's done forever here. Like the interesting part of what Believe was trying to be is still interesting. Um, but maybe that takes more time and he needs to go back to the lab and, you know, have a better like consistent onboarding flow of like startups who are willing to launch tokens on this thing. Um, because I think that's if you, if you can achieve the unlock, then I'd say there's a chance, right? Like if the next Uber launched a token like rather than doing like an equity raise or something on chain, then like that's very interesting and people are going to want to buy that. I think it's interesting because he has, um, a opinionated go to market on the supply side of specific token issuers, um, that are, um, it's just like, it's just a really interesting niche. Um, I also think given that go to market, it doesn't really matter that he's not capitalizing on momentum today. Like I think most crypto apps, like they need to own the moment or else they die. And because the supply side is so unique, I don't know how much it matters because if you win an interesting token issue where all of a sudden your app is rele, your app is relevant again, the downside is there's people have seen this, you know, it's twice now, right? ICM moment one earlier in the year, ICM moment two, and, um, you know, will there be more competition for ICM moment three?\n\n\nI think that's the question.\nWait, did we already have moment two?\nBelieve is moment two.\nMoment one was like January, February when we had Jelly Jellycoin or what have you.\nGod, that was the dark.\nThat was the original.\nThat was the first popup there.\nThis one's so much more serious though, I think, because of what Believe is doing.\nLike the first one was inherently scammy.\nIt was just like, hey, buy like buying coin to support like the Vine like whatever the Vine team did historically, which like makes no sense.\nBut this kind of like we're kind of like nearing Phantom equity and integration um of the token within the product.\nUm there's like a very sophisticated effort around helping founders understand how to manage these communities with like I think it's called like the belief playbook.\nUm, it's just much more professionalized uh than the first go around.\nYeah, as the great philosopher once said, V2 is better than V1.\nIt's a hot pick, but I think it's correct, but V3 will be will be better, Ryan.\nAnd maybe it's not past V3 is going to be even better than V2.\nThat's the thing.\nThat's what you think.\nNot necessarily.\nI'll dive into it on our late next spot, but it's not necessarily true.\nSo just keep that in mind.\nSo he's already making improvements to the model like understanding getting feedback.\nOkay, this isn't working like with the snipers and stuff.\nHe's trying and incorporating stuff to stop snipers.\nHe's again trying to figure out the curation thing.\nHe's going to iterate over time and as long as there isn't some competitor that's figured it out and hits the market, they're really the only one focused on ICM token launches and all it takes is one or two like really really solid projects to to launch their token on believe and this thing uh like rips uh because then you get the reflexive cycle of you know web two builders see the successful builders launching on believe raising a bunch of money they then launch their tokens and it starts like a really cool reflexive cycle.\nAll right, I love it.\nLet's uh let's crash out on Gemini then.\nJames, you wanted to talk about it.\nIPL for Gemini.\nYeah, I mean I it's probably the worst run exchange and like one of the worst run crypto companies that I've ever ever had the mispleasure of of experiencing and working with.\nUm yeah, it's shocking to me that they're still around.\nUh, does anyone have anything good to say about Gemini?\nDid they do something to you?\nNo, it's just terrible.\nIt's just a horrible experience.\nIt's just it's just like they're just a company that will not go away and they're just it's just terrible.\nIt's terrible.\nDo you know, James, you're muted.\nThe do they have a bit license?\nUh, that I have no idea.\nNo, but in all seriousness, I I really I got like a a really a sour taste in my mouth after um Genesis and their whole program is just it was it just it just stunk and it was just a very bad they didn't resolve it well with customers.\nUm and they've just been super slow and everything and they've just never bothered to really expand, right?\nLike their institutional offering doesn't exist unless you guys know differently than me.\nUm and I I don't know.\nI don't know why anyone would buy their IPO.\nWhere would Gemini rank?\nLike, so if you're gonna make a list?\nYeah.\nDo you mean like volume-wise or just like um you know the James Kristoff version?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nMet metrics wise.\nSorry.\nNot like because they murdered his dog.\nSo yeahise book.\nYeah.\nSorry.\nGo ahead.\nI was just going to say they do 10% of Coinbase's volume.\nthe majority of their volume is both in like you know the BTC and ETH pairs and then their alt liquidity and their alt alt coin volume is like pretty dismal and I imagine that's where you make a lot of your money given a lot of these exchanges have like you know uh tiered fees and a lot of these people who are probably trading these two majors are probably just arbing across multiple venues.\nYeah, like their 24 their 24-hour volume on BTC is not even hundred million dollars.\nWhat?\nThat seems ridiculous.\nSurely that's fake.\nYou're lying to me, James.\nI'm on the I'm on exchange.\n24hour 24-hour volume is 97.6 million bucks on BTC.\nI was going to say we have a nice centralized exchange dashboard now, but we did not include Gemini.\nI'm guessing maybe because they were not large enough.\nSo maybe maybe soon.\nI mean, yeah, it sucks that they were caught up in that uh the Genesis thing.\nLike maybe things would have been different.\nUm it's been hard in the exchange space.\nI think Coinbase was a early first mover and they really benefited from regulatory arbitrage and I think it was hard to compete.\nUm and perhaps the the Wlvoss twins are um already rich.\nI know that they are a large Bitcoin holder so perhaps it's not a huge priority.\nI feel the same way about Coinbase, James.\nSo, we can talk about that as well.\nI hate Coinbase.\nAnd I was right.\nAnd multiple people were wrong.\nEverybody thought that Coinbase was going to do really really well because they have legal um whatever regulation on their side in the US and consistently I've been proven that they're just dog [ __ ] and are not doing well.\nHave you ever um been wrong on anything in the matter of cryptocurrency, Buck, or is it just like No, this is just I don't like their energy.\nRyan, they they hurt Ryan once and I really I'm one of those employees that like really has to stick up for their superiors.\nAnd I think that's what really got me going.\nRyan, do you want to talk about how Brian personally wronged you?\nNo.\nOkay.\nThen what I Bo bo you were right, you know, as coin went from like $30 to to like $300.\nAnd that's why it I knew there was going to be a vindicated.\nI knew there was going to be a dip back down to whatever it is at now.\nThat's why I didn't buy the move.\nI was right.\nYou're right.\nWhat What if it were Kraken IPOing?\nI actually really like Kraken.\nI think Kraken's a really good experience.\nSo, I've had I've had really good customer service experiences with Kraken.\nLike I actually once sent like some this is years ago like some stupid Osmos Osmosis token to the wrong chain and within like 24 hours their customer service actually sent it back to me.\nLike they're they're actually quite good.\nUm I I I really enjoy them.\nI I can't say good enough things about them.\nSponsored post.\nI mean they're definitely next.\nYeah, absolutely.\nI think just judging from things I've seen on Arkham, a lot of the older wallets also prefer to use Kraken, it seems, over Coinbase, which is a bit interesting.\nAnd volume-wise, they do about half of Coinbase's 24-hour volume.\nThat's not bad.\nAnd the the it's Ian, the point that you make on old wallets is interesting.\nUm, I've heard that the Kraken team is like more crypto OG than the Coinbase team.\nThey're like more aligned with the ethos.\nUm, but they're also acting more flexible today like around the Salana stuff I think is pretty interesting.\nThere seems to be like some pragmatism coming out of there which which is always good to see.\nYeah, I think you feel it in the product experience like as a user there seems to be a lot of flexibility around you know how many different addresses you can generate and like where you can withdraw to or what you can do with certain types of assets.\nUm, their stance on self-custody and different things like that.\nI think they've really they've I think they've kind of had that maybe captured that OG user for some of those reasons being you know maybe more crypto ethos align to some extent at least in their product choices.\nUm I agree with you as well Ryan like there being uh some maybe somewhat early to the uh trading equities on chain idea.\nWe we'll see when that launches.\nI think it's interesting like I would have expected somebody like Coinbase to be running down that avenue more quickly.\nSo it's interesting to see Kraken maybe iterating iterating a little more quickly than than Coinbase is.\nYeah, I like Kraken.\nThink they're good.\nYou can always trust them.\nWell, now they're going to go under because they said that.\nBut I trust it.\nFew months where you weren't supposed to talk about centralized exchanges at all and anytime anybody brought up like a sex, people were like, &quot;Holy [ __ ] it's going on there.\nThat's why people brought it up.&quot;\nNot your keys, not your cryptobach.\nYeah, they might explode next week.\nThat's true.\nKnock on wood.\nUm, Danny, do you want to wrap it up?\nRyan's clearly gotten bored and left.\nYeah, we're not uh intellectually interesting enough for Ryan Connor to continue.\nNo, this has been good.\nI think the Ethereum the Ethereum stream over on Bank list.\nIf he if he was camera off listening to Banklist, I think I might end it all right now.\nYou'd have to ship me a rope.\nUm all right, let's call it there.\nWe've been going for a while.\nI think it was good two and a half hours today.\nThanks for coming on today.\nLet's before we close out, actually, we did this last time, too.\nBuck, real quick.\nPermission list is coming up I think in two and a half weeks.\nI want to say June 24th through the 26th.\nYou guys know the code at 0x10 for 10% off tickets to permissionless 4 in Brooklyn, New York.\nI'm only laughing because James, how much do they cost now?\nJames is a loyal fan and he paid a lot when we first began and then we did a flash 50 and then James sent me 15 messages in a row calling me an idiot.\nlike I make the decisions for the for the tickets.\nWe don't get to choose the ticket prices, but we do have 0x10 the code for 10% off if you want to come out to promotion list.\nWe are going to have a dunk tank.\nA bunch of folks on this stream will be getting in the dunk tank.\nFor all you Lions out there, Ryan Connor, Ryan Connor will get in the dunk tank.\nWe will will it into existence.\nHe doesn't think so.\nAll right.\nAwesome.\nThanks for coming on today, guys.\nJames, Ian, and all the Block Works folks, Boach, Ryan, Westy.\nAppreciate you guys coming on for the second live stream.\nZeroX Research live stream.\nWe will be back again next week, of course.\nAnd the normal pods will roll as per usual.\nUntil next time, we will see you then.\nThanks, Danny.\nI don't know why it's showing that.\nGreat work, Picachio.\nWe're still live, bud.\nYeah.\nNo, I wanted people\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
