  "cleanText": "What was interesting to me is, like, you know, double-clicking on the treasury codes. Um, let's look at MicroStrategy. Like, people, you know, we even on this pod, we've talked about how much leverage is coming in because of these treasury cores, and you know, when is the ball going to drop? And then I look at the number one, you know, strategy, I look at the number one, you know, this, the, the person who started it all, Michael Sailor, and based on their enterprise value, which is just market cap plus debt. And if you look at how much debt that they've issued to purchase these, these Bitcoin, and even include their preferred shares. I know a lot of analysts don't like to, you know, include preferred shares in their debt, but at the end of the day, preferred shares, most of them at least, are obligations to shareholders. They're like a higher tier. So it come, it does come, like if it's an obligation, it is debt, and I, I do treat it as such. And even with the preferred shares and the amount of debt that they've raised and purchased BTC, that's about 11 billion. And we're looking at strategies 125 billion market cap, 120 thereabouts. So we're looking at a debt to enterprise value of like, of 10% or less, which really isn't that levered.\n\nA quick shout out to today's sponsor, Katana. We'll hear more about Katana and their ongoing pre-eposit campaign later today, but for now, let's get into the episode.\n\nNothing said on 0xResearch is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our opinions, not financial advice. Carlos, Marc, Danny, and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects discussed.\n\nAll right, welcome back to another episode of 0xResearch, guys. Today I'm joined by Carlos and Mark Arjun. Uh, bit of a research team special today. Uh, Boccaccio could not make it. He felt he didn't have any strong enough takes to share on the podcast this week, which is unfortunate, but um, glad to have Carlos and Mark on. How are you guys doing today?\n\nAll good. How about you guys?\n\nYeah, all good on my end. Can't complain.\n\nUh, I think could be doing better. Uh, you know, the Pump, the Pump sale and the activities there leave are leaving a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Certain exchanges, I think, dropped the ball there. Um, but that's okay. We move on. I think in other news, the market has really been, well, I guess at least hot for a few assets. Bitcoin has just been like trudging up to new highs. I think what touched 123K, I want to say, uh, if not a little higher.\n\nAnd I guess the other big one is hype. Uh, that's really the only other alt, unless you guys think of some others, um, that's really been like outperforming as of late. Solana's kind of been struggling. ETH, I think, has been doing a little bit better than SOL, but you know, still relative to Bitcoin, not not crazy. So, um, and actually some of the like boomer altcoins uh caught a bit of a pop recently. I saw XRP and like XLM, some of those uh moved again. So, we're in kind of like an interesting time in the market. I don't know if there's anything like catching your guys' eye right now or if it's just like, you know, crazy season right now.\n\nYeah, I think the other sector that has been outperforming as of late, like not necessarily the past week, but like in the past months has been lending. Um, just uh, looking at Maple Oiler, uh, some of the big outperformers. Um, I think one of the characteristics that's interesting from both of these protocols is that they are not like launches of DeFi cycle, but they were launched uh, in the previous cycle, and they, they just like fixed their old model, uh, grinded up, like, and then recovered back their TVL, uh, their borrows, and now they're back at all-time highs. I just think it speaks to the resilience of both teams. Uh, it's definitely one of the outperformers of, of this last few months.\n\nYeah, for me, it's more like same old, same old. Bitcoin keeps going up. Everything else is experiencing some diversion. I feel like BTC hitting all-time highs is has been getting less and less exciting every time it does it. Um, it's just almost become like the new norm, which in my opinion is kind of a good thing. It's maybe a sign of a maturing, a maturing asset. Um, especially with all, you know, with the institutions and ETFs and whatnot. And then again, hype, I mean, you know, probably hype and Pump, probably the two most popular apps in the space right now. Um, you know, you got to love it. Um, and hype is just, I mean, it's, it's done better than I thought over, over the past two months, to be honest. I'm not going to lie, but then it has the fundamentals to back it up. You see open interest hitting all-time highs. You, you know, if you comparing it to the other centralized exchanges that have um, per as an offering, you see their market share relative to them continue to grow like month over month, quarter over quarter. So like this, you know, it's good to see an example of at least like even Carlos's mention of lending protocols recovering their TVL, recovering their boring rates. It's just good to see instances of these like core DeFi protocols increasing in price because of their fundamentals increasing as well.\n\nYeah, I like that. I think um, maybe one of the painful things for for people in this market, I guess if you're, you know, sticking specifically to tokens is that um, it's been very concentrated, right? If you're not a BTC holder or a hype holder or a you know, Oiler syrup holder, um, there's not a lot going on. You know, most other tokens look pretty devastated. But meanwhile, on the equity side of things, both both real businesses and treasury strategy codes um, have seem seemingly been where like a lot of the kind of fast and hot price action has been at. Um, I think in some cases that's been positive, right? Like Coinbase and Robin Hood have been doing well on the back of, you know, some announcements, new product rollouts, like favorable, you know, regulation. Circle, circle obviously doing very well following their IPO um, in sort of in light of the regulatory climate and like, you know, TradFi seemingly wanting some kind of exposure to that or maybe trading it on the momentum, you know, what have you there. Um, and then the Treasury codes have kind of just continued going down the line. So, you know, we've gone from strategy focusing solely on Bitcoin to now there's ETH Co, Solana Co, Hype, you know, XRP, there's tons of them. Um, and they keep moving on down that line. But regardless, it's like you mentioned, like Bitcoin has kind of just been inching up. Um, and a lot of other things I think have struggled to keep up. I guess Mark, you you wrote about um, Bitcoin recently, like an updated monthly note. Curious if there's any like big takeaways on just the market for Bitcoin, what we're seeing there. Um, some key kind of ideas that we're thinking about right now.\n\nYeah, I mean, when I when I wrote the note, it was recapping June. Um, and I'm going to say some metrics that were down, but these metrics don't really matter for BTC that much. Like REV was down, um, fees were down, monthly, uh, you know, daily active users, monthly active users, that was down. But then there's never really a strong correlation with that in price anyway, except maybe during the ordinal, you know, rune season that we had a while back, and that activity is also down too. Um, but what was also down, um, which I started to cover in last June's report was um, like BTC held on centralized exchanges and also probably and also BTC held by over-the-counter exchanges as well. So I, I brought this up because there's some, you know, if you, you know, BTC on exchanges has been trending down for some while now, like maybe over a year, year and a half, and you know, it's just a natural progression of things as as the instrument has become more popular and being taken up by ETFs and these treasury cores and even like whales and individual investors, but it's now getting close to the limit where we can start to see a squeeze a little bit on it, like the amount of BTC that these, these exchanges hold are getting eaten up, you know, on a percentage relative basis very quickly. So, I thought that was something interesting of note. I think right now we're around, you know, we're hitting nearly 2 million uh, BTC on exchanges. You know, I've heard, you know, that from, you know, whispers that some market makers talking that if this comes down to like sub, like 1.8 million, 1.7, we can start to see a little bit more squeeze on BTC. So that's why I thought it was worth a mention.\n\nBut then this on the flip side, something that was up was um, Bitcoin ETF Inflows, net inflows. And it was three straight months of like multi-billion dollars of straight net inflows. Of course, BlackRock's iBit was the, you know, dominant factor behind this. I mean, I think I, they have a ridiculous amount. I think they have like, I can't even remember how much BTC they have right now off hand, but they're they're the largest by some margin. And this combined with the reduction of BTC held on exchanges made me write that if this, I mean, this data here is from June, right? Um, and I wrote that if this momentum continued into July that we would see, you know, there's a chance we would see Bitcoin hit all-time highs. And you know, guess what? We did. Um, and then even like very, you know, this is this is just a model I have work that I've been keeping track of in my back. But even like very rudimentary, if you look at this chart here, and then for the listeners at home, we just have uh, a chart showing BTC monthly um, flows by month, um, US ETF flows by month. And if you see the Jan, the first period when it started, the January, February, March, that's when, you know, Bitcoin ramped past 7, hit its new all-time high for the first time. Then it came back down, and then we see again in October, November, December, another, you know, few months of 2 billion, 3 billion, 6 billion plus U flows, and then again BTC hit, I think that's when it hit its 100k mark for the first time, and then we had a little period again after, you know, liberation day, Trumpo, um, you know, Trump memecoin, all of this stuff, and then again from April, uh, we've started to see Bitcoin price recover as well as again, three months, at least three months of multi billion at $3 billion or more of inflows, and like even like this rudimentary chart, you can see that, you know, maybe another all-time high was due, especially with some consolidation, open interests for Bitcoin remain near all-time high across all exchanges, including all-time highs on Hyperlid as well. So just, you know, just the amalgamation of these different concepts, it, you know, it almost maybe wasn't surprising, uh, maybe I should have been a little bit more vocal with this, but uh, yeah, strong, strong month for Bitcoin, and you know, the ETF flows continue to come in, and the amount of BTC on exchanges continue to fall, and we're starting to see a little bit more, um, we're starting to see a little bit more interest and leverage starting to creep back in. Whether that's good or bad, you know, remains to be seen, but it looks healthy.\n\nDo you have any idea, Mark? Something I was thinking about while you were talking about the And I'll just jump back the forward, jump back the exchange reserves of BTC versus like ETF holdings as well as like thinking about all these treasury companies. Uh, do like I know, for example, that many of the ETFs do have agreements with like Coinbase, for example, to custody and hold that Bitcoin. Is is that being included in these exchange reserve balances?\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah. Treasury codes, ETFs, um, none of those are included in exchange reserves. And also, and this may be to the flip side of it, OTC's, OTC desks also aren't considered in it. So, that's also an So, that's an extra supply that needs to be considered, but you know, those are also running low.\n\nOkay.\n\nI, I just checked iBit's AUM. It's 80, almost 86 billion, which is it's ridiculous. It's almost it's literally higher than the market cap of Solana, I think. Like\n\nyeah, the uh, the interesting thing here is like the I just I pulled the the ETF BTC holdings, and they're sitting at like across the board something like 1.3 million units.\n\nUm, which could explain probably a lot of this maybe move is if a bunch of if if a ton of supply is maybe moving off of exchanges and just into sort of like storage for those ETF holdings to be then be traded, probably regulated custodians.\n\nBut it'd be great, maybe this is something we need as like a follow-up is to track exchange reserves plus ETF holdings plus, you know, Treasury co- holdings and see where that like broader balance is trending over time.\n\nYeah, definitely. And I, I also think another contributing contributing factor to it, too, is that because BTC is hitting these all-time highs, the miners are holding on to more of their Bitcoin right now, you know, in anticipation of bigger moves. So that's also giving it a bit of a stretch. This episode is sponsored by Katana. If your assets are sitting idly, they're dead. Katana is built from the ground up to bring your bags back to life.

How does um, I guess is there anything big in regards to we talk treasury co, like how strategy is playing in and mentioned that the ETFs are holding like, I mean, they're holding a few percent now of supply in total amount of Bitcoin, and I know uh, Sailor and Strategy are also a very large contributor, um, and he's still putting in pretty massive buys.\n\nYeah. Um,\n\nStrategy has 600,000 Bitcoin on their on their balance sheet. Um, it's an actually crazy amount. I think that's like nearly 3% of of of all the Bitcoin, if I say 21 million. But in reality, I, you know, it's hard to say for sure, but based on how long Bitcoin's been around and how many wallets are probably been lost and how many haven't been moved, it's you know, there probably\n\n\nBitcoin is around 16 million in total.\nSo, like 5 million Bitcoin probably lost over the years.\nOver the past, I don't know what has it been, 17 years.\nThat's crazy.\nFeel old.\nUm, so, so, I mean, if I look at it like that, you know, MicroStrategy has probably close to 5% of all, like, let's quote unquote, available, um, BTC.\nAnd I, yeah, I recently did a report.\nIt just actually just dropped today, um, on different ways to get exposures to Bitcoin, not just directly holding it or through synthetics like per or whatever, more like treasury codes, ETFs, the miners, even like preferred stocks, convertible bonds, just like a few different ways.\nBut what was interesting to me is, like, you know, double-clicking on the treasury codes.\nUm, let's look at MicroStrategy, like people, you know, we even on this part, we've talked about how much leverage is coming in because of these treasury cores, and you know, when is the ball going to drop?\nBut then I look at the number one, you know, MicroStrategy, I look at the number one, you know, this, the, the person who started it all, Michael Sailor, and based on their enterprise value, which is just market cap plus debt, and if you look at how much debt that they've issued to purchase these, these Bitcoin, and even include their preferred shares.\nI know a lot of analysts don't like to, you know, include preferred shares in their debt, but at the end of the day, preferred shares, most of them at least, are obligations to shareholders.\nThey're like a higher tier.\nSo, it come, it does come, like if it's an obligation, it is debt.\nAnd I, I do treat it as such.\nAnd even with the preferred shares and the amount of debt that they've raised and purchased BTC, that's about 11 billion.\nAnd we're looking at, uh, you know, MicroStrategy's $125 billion market cap, 120 or thereabouts.\nSo we're looking at a debt to enterprise value of, like, of 10% or less, which really isn't that levered.\nLike, if you, if I did this, if I did the analogy of a homeowner, um, if the homeowner had paid off this much debt, they would be in year 27 of their 30-year mortgage, right?\nSo, and that doesn't seem very risky.\nThey have, you know, three years left to pay it off.\nLike, I don't think, well, only talking about MicroStrategy or MicroStrategy, I don't think it's as risky as many people are make, have made it out to be in the past.\nUm, so, you know, and once it continues to trade above NAV, um, I think it's about 1.8 right now.\nUm, I think once it continues to trade above NAV and they continue with these preferred shared offerings, the different tiers, they continue with their at the money market offerings, I think, I mean, it seems relatively sustainable at these levels.\nYeah, I think where the question marks come in are these smaller companies that we keep seeing doing raises from outside investors, um, and then diluting their shares and kind of running up that playbook a little bit.\nUm, I haven't done as deep of a dive here as you mentioned on MicroStrategy, but I know Dan Smith, this is something he's digging into, is getting some data on more of these, like, there's a, there's a bit of a strategy here, right?\nNo pun intended.\nYou take a, you take a failing company that's worth very little, maybe even a few million market cap, like maybe at risk of being delisted from, you know, primary exchanges.\nUm, you know, you get an outside investor with a ton of capital and then, you know, commit some, some funding money to buy Bitcoin or other crypto and then dilute shares and give that investor, you know, a decent price for the the shares that they're being offered for, you know, some of the funding that they're providing.\nUm, from what I've seen, like, often times that the debt that they're raising, the the market cap that then these things trade to is is nearly like one to one of the debt that they've just raised to buy, um, that asset, which is interesting.\nUm, it, it seems there's, there's maybe a bit more of like a FOMO kind of retail, you know, buy the, you know, buy the the news kind of excitement going on there.\nUm, and I think we've seen it with some of the larger ones, um, lately, right?\nLike if you look at ESB or BMR, which I think are ETH-based treasury codes, but either way, you see a pretty strong, like, pump off of the news of, hey, we just raised 500 million or we just raised a billion to buy this asset, and then, you know, a few days later, and you see the price kind of recorrect a significant amount.\nSo, uh, it does seem like that's where the more concerning kind of piece of the pie is.\nIs it the volatility or is it the risk of these companies crashing and then being forced to sell Bitcoin into the market or whatever asset it is?\nYeah.\nI mean, I don't, I don't think there's necessarily a problem for the companies, right?\nThey're, um, they're getting to tr to potentially sell out shares at, you know, inflated valuations from, you know, these announcements.\nIt's really just like a little bit of like a retail trap.\nUh, it seems.\nUm, the, the risk concerns, it's hard to say.\nI mean, I get, I think if you maybe if you get far enough down the line where you've got enough of these spread out and that retail bid kind of dissipates, um, but, but you keep launching new, new initiatives to do that.\nUh, maybe then you have to kind of give up and start dumping the crypto that you've been trying to purchase this whole time.\nUm, but it's hard to say.\nIt right now.\nIt doesn't feel like that's, that doesn't seem like a a near-term outcome anyway.\nYeah, I, I agree.\nBut, and I think maybe one way we, we can get some insight into this is look at the miners from the 2017, 2021 cycle.\nThese things used to trade at crazy premium scenarios.\nTreasury cores, and they also did, um, share, they also participated in share dilution, and you know, one prime example of this is Riot, um, Riot Platforms.\nIt's one of the largest publicly traded miners.\nThey have, like, 20% of the hash rate market share among publicly traded miners, and they have, you know, they probably are the biggest holders of all of the BTC miners.\nSo they really try not to sell their Bitcoin, and in, and as a consequence of such, they have, they're forced to basically pay the operating costs and the price of their mining rigs through, um, sales of their own shares.\nSo, you know, between 2017 and now, like Riot used to trade, I think in 2017 they hit, um, $46 in 2017, and then they ran up in the next cycle in 2021 to $79.\nBut now they're trading at around $10, um, per share.\nAnd that's because between 2017 and now they have diluted shareholders by 60x, right?\nSo, you know, and, and unless, unless Bitcoin has gone up 60x between now and then, it wouldn't have worked out, and Bitcoin did not.\nUm, so it's an example.\nAnd so these shareholders, they own a company that's continues to take good, you know, continues to take sizable market share, continues to hold, um, Bitcoin on their treasury sheet.\nThey're actually trading at a NAV of like 1.1 right nowish.\nSo they're basically, they're almost like an ETF with a little bit of a mining kicker, you know, that if that's a way to view them.\nAnd shareholders have, you know, just be, you know, degraded over the years from, from the longer-term consequences of this dilution.\nSo I think that is one risk that we could see, um, with some of these other treasury cores because it, I mean, at the end of the day, it's really going to depend on the how, what kind of debt you, you get as in what kind of ratings you receive as well as, um, the timings of your market buys.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSpeaking of the timings of the market buys, one thing that I find interesting about MicroStrategy is just how their average Bitcoin price has gone up over the past, uh, year or so, and it's now around $71,000.\nUm, it used to be, if I recall correctly, like $30,000 a year from a year ago.\nUm, curious if you guys think, like, MicroStrategy is going to eventually, like, um, like Bitcoin is going to eventually trade below MicroStrategy's, uh, average price because it's only going to get out, go up from here, like the, the average, uh, buy price, like, curious how you think about, uh, Bitcoin trading eventually below MicroStrategy's price.\nUm, I don't know in, in the near term.\nI don't see it.\nI'm, I'm mainly going off of this.\nI, I mean, you know, past performance isn't any kind of way to judge future returns, but I'm going off of this anecdote that any every successful ETF always has a better second year.\nSo, I'm expecting the Bitcoin ETFs in terms of net in net inflows to surpass 2024.\nAnd then, you know, with all of these treasury cores pumping, you know, going up, and and also, I don't believe in cycles anymore.\nI haven't since I've started to lose my faith in cycles since January 20, since the ETFs, since the Bitcoin ETFs came out, I've started to lose my my belief in cycles.\nAnd as the years, as the two years have one and a half years have gone on, we haven't even seen a real altcoin season, no NFT season.\nYou know, we've had a meme coin season, but none, none of the same, none of the same experiences from the 2017 and 2021 cycles that I lived in.\nSo, you know, because of that too, I, I just see more of a steady increase in Bitcoin.\nAnd, you know, Bitcoin's volatility is has also dampened.\nIt's less than, like, 50 companies in the S&P in the S&P 500.\nSo, like, I just think it's changed.\nSo, I don't, I don't know if if the average cost will get higher than the BTC price in the near term, but you know, maybe, you know, I mean, it's Bitcoin.\nYou know, this thing is volatile still, so it could crash.\nUm, but even then, I think, I think if it does, I think Michael Sailor will probably raise even more money and just buy even more.\nYeah, it, it's really hard to reason about.\nI think even in the scenario where you saw a, you saw a significant pullback in Bitcoin.\nI'm just, uh, you know, I, I think it would open some question marks at that point, right?\nLike, you know, if you can't, if people aren't willing to, uh, provide more funding for more raises, for more purchases, then, like, maybe you get a, maybe that's what the next bare market looks like is kind of everyone looking around and going like, well, who's, who's going to buy Bitcoin when, uh, Sailor can't slam the infinite bid into the market?\nUm, and I think that'll be a question mark, but at current time, it feels like, you know, he can keep slamming bid, and as long as the market keeps going up, like, he'll be fine.\nAlthough his execution continues, I think, to baffle people.\nThis is the first time in a while where, um, the recent, like, average price that was posted was lower than the market price when the announcement was posted.\nBut I think it's far too often where you see, yeah, we just purchased, you know, 100 million worth of Bitcoin at a price that is above, you know, the price for the last 5 days, and you sit there wondering, like, where, when, why, and how did you buy above, like, clearing price for the past week.\nUm, so I think maybe that's something that he could improve on, but it almost kind of goes in favor of his, like, legacy of just like topless the thing and it works out.\nSo, yeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, I don't expect it to trade below his average price in the near term as well, but like, we're going to have a bare market eventually, right?\nLike, I don't believe, like, we have, like, a super cycle.\nI don't know if you guys believe that, but eventually we, we're going to have a big pullback.\nAnd when that happens, like, it's entirely possible that Bitcoin trades, like, near or below Sailor's average, like, buy price.\nI think it, it's going to be like an interesting level, maybe a a good support level for Bitcoin.\nYeah, it probably would become like something of a of a major support to look at.\nUm, where people see, like, continued funding coming into MicroStrategy to to continue to buy.\nUm, I think that does make some kind of, there's like some psychological sense there, I think that the market might have to process.\nShout out to today's sponsor, Katana.\nKatana is a DeFi-first chain built for

technology involve risk.\nTerms and conditions apply.\nDo your own research.\nI think we've, we've done some good coverage on Bitcoin.\nLet's maybe try to get to the other majors.\nUm, still talking about Treasury Co related though.\nUm, ETH has actually had some good times here lately.\nUm, Tom Lee has been going around on the news, um, and media coverage tour talking about, uh, BMR, um, which is the one, the, uh, Treasury Co that he's involved with.\nUm, SBET is another major one, but it, ETH has had a bit of a turnaround in the past few months, I want to say.\nUm, I think potentially even outperforming Solana as of late.\nUm, I don't know.\nMark, Carlos, any big thoughts?\nI feel like not much has necessarily changed with the fundamental story for ETH.\nLike I think we're still waiting to see improvements, but I don't know.\nWhat do we think?\nI mean, personally, I don't think fundamentals have changed drastically.\nThere's have been like a, like a change in direction from the Ethereum Foundation and then more of a focus towards the applications and the developers.\nBut fundamentally, I don't see anything change besides, like, the narrative, like, spun out by this, um, treasury companies, like, it is going to be the preferred layer for tokenization and for institutions and whatnot.\n\n\nThus, it should be valued higher, but I don't, I don't see it play out like at a fundamental level.\n\nYeah, I'm going to second that. Um, not much in fundamentals, more narrative shift. Um, I mean, I don't know. I mean, Bitcoin did the same thing, right? Bitcoin, they tried to be better money than the US dollar, and then that didn't really work out because of scaling, and then they tried to be better gold, and then that worked out. And I think right now, you know, I mean, not right now, but you know, Ethereum, ETH, the asset is just trying, you know, Ethereums are trying to shill it as the better Bitcoin. Um, and you know, I wouldn't put it, I wouldn't say that's going to happen, but I wouldn't put a 0% probability on it either. I'm not betting big, but like, you know, I've seen people, I've seen people, I've seen prominent investors hate on gold. I've seen prominent investors hate on Bitcoin, and I've see, I see prominent investors hate on, hate on ETH. I know when these things pull back, they, you know, they dance in the graves, and when these things go up, you know, they're flabbergasted. Um, I mean, ETH, ETH also had some, some good ETF Inflows in June, and and is, has been continuing on trend. So that's something positive. I think, I think we were talking about how, you know, some, some investors may think that they have missed the wave with Bitcoin, and they just want to go to ETH as well. I also think another factor is that, you know, if, if you're an institutional investor and you're going to, you've started to invest on asset class, you know, investing 101 for these institutions is diversification. So, you're going to at least throw some of your Inflows into, into ETH. Um, I think I'll do this chart for my next report, but if we did the ETF Inflows market cap weighted, I think the difference between the BTC Inflows and the ETH Inflows look a lot less large than they do now. So, um, I, I'm, I'm, I'm looking forward to like putting that out. But then also I think with ETH, you know, the narrative of tokenization, um, you know, it's, it's really more happening is, is you know, it's with Robinhood on Arbitrum, and then, you know, like Kraken has their Inkchain, and you know, Coinbase has their chain, Sony has their chain. These are really L2s. I think these things maybe help more for narrative than actually like ERV or fundamentals. But I think that's what Ethereums are trying to do now, change the narrative at least. But one thing I do like is that they are changing the, they are the narrative is actually making them scale the L1 a little bit more. There's this push for validators to get the scaling up from 36 million to 45 million. And I think about 40% of, Yeah, thanks. And this chart here shows that 48% of the validators on the network are signaling for that, um, for that 45, you know, that increase, that gas limit increase to 45 million. And you know, the Nethermind's new default, um, client is going to have the 45 million, um, on it if it already doesn't have. And I think they want to get this, this gas limit to 100 million by the end of the year, which would be great to see. I mean, like I might, you know, if we could move from 30 million this year to 100 million by the end of the year, I might even start to use Ethereum again. You know, if it starts to cost cents instead of dollars, um, we'll see. And then it can open up more applications. But you know, apart from that, I don't think much else tangible happening in the net, too.\n\nYeah, I think that's fair. One of the other big, um, you mentioned tokenization. It seems like one of the big kind of narratives going around, at least within media and like some TradFi names speaking around ETH, seems to be about this idea of being like the stable coin chain. Um, which kind of relates to tokenization, tokenization of the US dollar. That, um, either way, that it seems to be like something that people are running with more so than than anything else in the past. I, I would, I would mirror your comment about, you know, some of these, like Coinbase having, you know, base chain and Kraken having Inkchain and Arbitrum landing Robinhood. I, I feel like these are probably pretty immaterial to the bottom line of Ethereum. Um, and and maybe more so just a, maybe you get a marketing bump, but I think the value in those types of operations really go to the like brand name at the front. So like Coinbase is getting the value from having base, and Robinhood is going to get the value from, you know, deploying whatever they deploy, um, on Arbitrum. So, I guess we'll kind of see what comes of that, but at least for the time being, um, he's been having a good go, and maybe the, maybe the Treasury CO are contributing to that as well. I don't know. Slamming, you know, if you, if you raise a couple billion from, uh, private investors and if they're slamming bid into the asset or at least taking away some sell pressure that maybe was previously on the market, uh, maybe it gives it some free air that that it hasn't had in a while.\n\nYeah, because for the past year since ETFs came out, um, every, every quarter, Grayscale, you know, the old trust has been net negative. So, you know, it's had this constant sell pressure every single quarter to the tunes of billions, tens of billions of dollars over the past year. So, maybe taking away some of that sell pressure, as you said, has contributed towards some upside.\n\nYeah, an equal waiting approach is interesting as well. I feel like that is also another makes sense argument. You know, if you're a boomer or whoever really getting into the market first time or, you know, financial advisor or a larger, you know, fund and maybe allocating client, uh, client funds, like rather, you know, there's not really necessarily a need to take a super opinionated approach about the assets themselves rather than just a market weighted approach to the category, especially if you're taking maybe an opinionated approach on like what the fund, uh, kind of allocation looks like, right? Like if you're going 10% to crypto versus broadly the market is allocating, you know, close to nothing, um, you know, you can sort of win by measure of being early on that lens versus trying to like be early in altcoins.\n\nUm, all right. So, we're still, I think we're still sort of waiting to see, uh, what this new sort of pivot from ETH foundation and ETH kind of community looks like going forward, but at the very least, the gas increase signaling, like that looks positive. Um, we're seeing some kind of relative movement in the right direction. Uh, and I think we'll just have to see some more execution from, from, you know, the the guys, the foundation, the team, the community members, uh, within, within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Let's move on to our last, maybe big major, um, to discuss. Uh, maybe someday Hype will become part of that majors list, but, uh, for now, it's just one of the big, the bigger apps. Um, Solana is the other big one I think top of mind, having not as great of a run lately. Um, and instead of ETF Inflows, although they do have the Rex Osprey, um, one that just launched with, I think, some maybe relatively exciting Inflows early on. I don't know if those have continued in like recent days and weeks, but, um, REV has been, uh, sort of struggling to maintain a lower level ever since falling off at the beginning of the year, kind of following the, you know, election and then the Trump token kind of weekend, which was a major sort of, um, pop off kind of blowoff moment for like meme trading activity on the chain. Um, it's been sitting at this like new or maybe revisiting this low that we had, you know, back in 2024. Uh, I guess Carlos, you have any big takeaways on how Solana is looking, recent, recent price action, how the market's thinking about Solana?\n\nYeah, I mean, like clearly REV is down like 90% from its peak in January when Trump launched, uh, the Trump memecoin. Um, I think like the majority of RB is originated like from contentious transactions, and that originates mainly like from trading. Um, and what you have seen since March is basically a shift, um, in contentious transactions that had led to a decrease in RB, like you have seen like trading applications like Hyperlquid have maintained that high like watermark of like trading activity, and then you have like the high fees, and then on Solana, you have seen like the secular decline in like memecoin trading for the past like, uh, six months. I do think like in July, you can see an increase due to mainly the Pump TGE. I think we'll see an increase in RV, but like, let's see what happens, right? Um, another thing that I find interesting is what you were mentioning earlier regarding like the ETF. Um, the, the Rex Osprey soul ETF went live, and it gives exposure to staking rewards as well. Uh, what they did was a legal workaround where they, where they didn't launch like with the traditional 33 act, but they launched a curb under the 1940 act, and thus, um, the staking rewards that the ETF, uh, has, like they're a taxable event, so it's a more expensive ETF, but then it's the first to go to market, and it has seen like stronger than expected Inflows. It has seen like, uh, right now, I, it has like $73 million in AUM. Like for context, the Soul Futures ETF that was live only had like $22 million in AUM like three months after launching. So, it's definitely having like a stronger, uh, Inflows and the Futures ETF. And then once the Fidelities, Black Rocks of the world launch a soul staking ETF or like a spot ETF, I think we'll see like strong demand relative to the market cap of the assets such that, uh, in the same vein that Mark was saying, like you're not going to see the same Inflows as BTC and ETH, but maybe on a market cap adjusted basis, you do see like, uh, Inflows that are strong relative to the size of the asset.\n\nAnd then the other thing that I find interesting in June, uh, in regards to tokenization, was the launch of X stocks, um, by Back Finance. I think, um, despite soul being dubbed as a memecoin chain, you, you are seeing some progress like in DeFi and in interest from institutional participants, and that has been reflected like in private credit coming on chain like with Apollo markets and Sacred, like tokenization via X stocks, uh, Camino hitting an all-time high in $4 billion in deposit. So, I think you're seeing traction like on the DeFi side. It's just not as advertised as like the memecoin side of the of the chain.\n\nI think that makes sense. Something I wanted to pull up really quickly now that we have the data is we do have some limited data on sole ETF Inflows. Um, but we can see what you mentioned, like it's, it's had a couple of good days in the kind of eight figure range to this Osprey ETF. Obviously, I think like you said, the big question mark there is going to be if the larger issues issuers come to market. Um, maybe some more trusted names. Uh, that's potentially where you would see maybe a more consistent, uh, activity to, um, you know, one of these instruments.\n\nAnd then I think again, we don't have a ton of data, but we do now have Inflows as percent of market cap. So we can look at this chart, for example, and I'll take soul and ethof for a sec. Um, but we actually see like the the Bitcoin ETFs, uh, ranging in like this, you know, 002 to 005% um, kind of flow as percent of market cap range. And you can see this like recent growth that I think Mark was highlighting where the ETH ETFs have actually had some pretty impressive months or days and weeks. Um, as of late, there's been some, some growth here. Um, up into the, you know, higher, higher percent, you know, Inflows relative to market cap than than Bitcoin as of late. So, um, yeah, it seems there's a little bit more excitement there, and I think we'll have to kind of wait and see for soul. Not enough data yet, but, um, at least in the same relative ballpark, right? We're looking at these like low, um, couple of bips, uh, relative to market cap, uh, Inflows into these instruments. So, it does seem to be at least relatively consistent from, from that rough kind of metric comparison so far.\n\nYeah, I agree. And it's, it's a good sign, uh, because this ETF, like the Rex Osprey ETF has a relatively expensive, uh, management fee due to the staking, uh, tax situation, and then it's not as like well known as you were saying as some of the big names. So if you get a traditional spot ETF approved, then maybe you see demand pick up, uh, more than you have.\n\nHow do we feel, uh, maybe just gauging your guys thoughts generally about Solana? I think, you know, 2024 was kind of like, and maybe even back the tail half of 2023 was sort of like the story of Solana, um, kind of like making its comeback and then sort of becoming the like onchain kind of like trading frontrunner, uh, relative to Ethereum in the Ethereum ecosystem at that time. Uh, it seems like that viewpoint has maybe recently shifted over to Hyperl now that's like become like the venue to watch for like onchain trading. Um, not to say that Soul is not iterating, but, uh, it does seem like the momentum there, uh, is struggling a little bit, and maybe like the very exciting parts about Soul are maybe more so on the application side, right? Pump just did their ICO and now token launch. Um, and application revenues like still look great, right? If you look around at trading apps, if you look at, you know, the comminos, if you look at the the trading bots, right? The axioms and the f photons, like these are businesses that are printing. Um, but I don't know, what are our thoughts here just generally on Solana as we look forward. Uh, are we kind of setting a new low for Rev that's, you know, tuned to pick up when we get, you know, maybe greater enhancements to throughput, um, and potentially drive some more demand on chain or are we headed lower?\n\nI mean, RB doesn't look, uh, great, like just following the trend, it has been decreasing since January. What I will say is that I feel confident saying that the ratio between application revenue and reb will keep increasing. Uh, meaning that applications will increasingly earn more, uh,\n\n\nthan what validators and stakers make on the chain.\nAnd I think this is great.\nI think it's like the ultimate sign of a business, of an ecosystem's success, is just like, can businesses launch there and be successful?\nAnd I think like Solana is clearly yes, that is the case.\nYou have seen the pumps of the world, like the axioms of the world, like um, and you have se and you can see in this chart, right?\nLike, uh, if you go back to the beginning of 2024, applications were for every dollar that applications made on Solana, Solana was making like a dollar as well in like REV.\nLike today, for every $2.4 that applications make, like Solana makes $1.\nSo, like, it's it has just been trending up, and I think that is like, if you're a developer and you have to launch on any given chain today, or if you have to build out your own infrastructure, unless you're like a Robin Hood and like have the, you know, the capabilities to build out your own chain or whatever, like think about like 80%, 90% of uh businesses that want to come on chain, like I think Solana is clearly like the best choice to do it.\nUh, I don't know if you guys have the same takes, but I don't think like like we like people have been talking about Robin Hood and Arbitrum, and like institutions are going to build out their own chains, but I don't think like they don't like I don't think all businesses have the same capabilities that Robin Hood has.\nSo I think like many businesses will just choose to launch like an application on an existing like chain like Solana.\nYeah, I'm going to second that.\nUnless you're a large institution who has the capabilities to like, you know, create your own chain or have, you know, pay for an L2, use an L2 provider, or you have enough distribution, then or some regulatory issues, then I think like the easiest way is to probably launch on a chain like Solana, and you get that distribution.\nOn the flip side, though, it's it's like, you know, the number of developers in crypto is so small compared to traditional developers, and then you know, the you know, they need to take a risk when they're doing these applications, and then it's like career risk.\nIt's maybe it's a little bit less risky to go with a larger company, go with an L2, and who's going to do their own L2, and you're a developer there for them.\nUm, but then when we see trends like this, as as Carlos' chart points out, I think this is this needs to trend a lot higher so we can get those entrepreneurs and those developers more comfortable with this kind of business model.\nYeah, I mean, I think it makes sense from this perspective of, well, as well, Carlos, around app revenues just continuing to grow.\nI mean, I think if you're potentially a founder or a developer, and you see, you know, apps making running at, you know, hundreds of millions of annual run rate, uh, with trading apps on Solana, um, you look at that and you, you feel like you look at that and you just think opportunity, like there's money to be made here if you can offer a better product, or if you if there's another niche within that market that's not being tapped quite yet.\nUm, and so I think from that perspective, like it makes a ton of sense.\nUm, so yeah, and I I would echo the other point around distribution, like, you know, I think Coinbase and Bass have been successful because of the distribution that that Coinbase has in this scenario, and not because of the fact that like they built a chain and and they were able to do so.\nUm, simply spinning out a chain is like not going is not the winning formula here.\nIt's having the distribution, getting people to operate there and and turn, you know, revenues and RV and cash flows out of the operation of that thing.\nUm, and I think the same goes for, you know, when you look at a Robin Hood, it's they could have realistically probably launched anywhere.\nUm, and maybe there's some incentives at play, um, that help determine where that location was going to be, or maybe just, you know, successful BD operations.\nBut yeah, I think either way, it's kind of like they they can be successful anywhere, but you know, small first-time devs or new entrance to the markets.\nUh, I feel like you got to flow to where the money is, and clearly there's a ton of money uh at least within within trading on Solana.\nNow maybe you could make the case for some DeFi applications to go to like Ethereum, for example, but that that's a pretty like locked in market at this place.\nIt's much harder to I think kind of enter in.\nBut we see it here and there.\nMorpho and maybe Oiler are kind of having a a bit of a good run lately.\nUm, but yeah, I think it's really about where you see the opportunities, and SOL has been that place um for a while now.\nWhen it comes to trading, I think on Ethereum, the Pers market, it maybe isn't so locked in, and that one is like ripe for a little bit more competition, especially as they increase the gas limit.\nI mean, I I think there's opportunities in a lot a lot of spaces, and you know, BNB has been dominating in trading activity for the past few months of all chains, and and you know, even in REV some months and some weeks.\nSo I think there's a few good options for developers out there, and and that same REV to that app revenue to REV trend is not Solana specific.\nIt's it's on other chains as well.\nSo it's a it's a welcome sign across the entire industry.\nYeah, great points.\nAnd I think the other like open question mark is going to be Hyperliquid.\nAnd I think what we're seeing more so now is rather than these like chain affiliations, we're seeing just like, you know, integrating the best product for the right purpose.\nSo like Phantom integrating Hyperliquid Purpose into their product.\nIt's like, you know, maybe maybe they grew up in this whole ecosystem, but like they've added more chains, right?\nYou know, you can use Bass, you can use SU in Phantom, and now they've got Hyperliquid purpose.\nLike I think it's really just for them about offering the right product to their customers.\nAnd I I think more and more as the like app revenue data is kind of highlighting that like building a good app, like sort of successful business is the most important part here.\nCatering to, you know, the the customer, the users of today, um, that are willing to, you know, spend fees on your thing, uh, is kind of the winning formula, and there's no sense being, you know, tied to a particular ecosystem if there's money to be made elsewhere.\nUm, and I think that's what we're we're kind of continuing to see that that trend play out.\nAwesome.\nWell, uh, I think this was a good good overview of the it kind of turned into a Crypto Majors episode.\nIt wasn't really meant to be.\nI think we were originally intending to cover some recent research, but, uh, turned out this way.\nThere was plenty to talk about.\nUm, the market has just been a little bit crazy with, uh, the Treasury CO miners, you know, buying up a bunch of crypto and putting it behind an equity.\nSo, uh, I think we centered around that, but glad to have you guys on.\nAny, uh, any big takeaways maybe in regards to maybe we'll do a takeaway on Pump.\nLike, what are your guys thoughts here?\nWe I think we've been doing this on a lot of pods.\nUh, it's priced at like five and a half billion FDV right now, I want to say.\nSo, it's still above that ICO sale price.\nUh, what do we think end of the year?\nUm, so December 31st, 2025, higher or lower than 4 billion FDV?\nI just want to say like before the price prediction that um I am now an onchain maximalist, and I will be deactivating my buy bit account.\nUm, and I think above four billion.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, I I think it's going to be above.\nI mean right now I think Danny and I, you were talking, we were talking about this earlier, Pump is the most valuable app in terms of FDV of of all of all apps that don't have their own chain, you know, like Uniswap has their own chain, you know, excluding those, cuz I think sometimes they get a little bit of a premium.\nPump is the is the highest, but I think I think I think most things are higher end of the year.\nI think regular, you know, we'll have hopefully two bills passed, hopefully lower interest rates, um, hopefully less wars.\nSo, um, I'm I'm very constructive on Q4 this year.\nI mean, I I think the most interesting question is like, if you think Bomb does really well, like what are the implications of that?\nLike the second order effects, like do you expect more ICOs?\nDo you expect like other launchpads to do well?\nLike what do you guys think?\nLike if Bomb does really well?\nYeah, this is what I'm excited about.\nI I think I mean I think it depends if the climate stays the same, right?\nIf there's still a ton of interest, if if the market kind of maintains its positive sort of um excitement around assets.\nBut, uh it seems like we're in maybe the the innings of like the ICO revival potentially.\nUm that's where I kind of see things going, and I think part of that has just been this shift away from the prior kind of administration's strangle hold over launching coins uh in that method.\nUh I think Pump, I don't think there are any others as of late that have done like a traditional ICO sale outside of maybe like echo rounds, things of that nature, where you need to be where it's not quite like an open permissionless, well I guess in this case it wasn't really an open permissionless sale in that from that perspective either, US participants could not um get involved, but yeah, I don't know, echo echko has been doing well.\nI think people like echko, and then the Pump one that like that's a very big token to have done um a sale of this nature.\nSo, I think it speaks to the market more broadly, and I would expect more to follow, assuming things continue to look good.\nThe the most recent IC I remember was cloud, um, the Solana ETF, um, not ETF, the Solana the staking um.\nYes.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd but unfortunately, unfortunately that one didn't do that well.\nSo I was hoping that would be the revival of ICOs, but okay.\nSo here's the Pump.\nYeah.\nI like it.\nI like it.\nI I think higher.\nUm, and maybe on a similar vein, like I don't know how it will play out with with regulation, whatnot, but I'm still relatively excited by this internet capital markets idea.\nUm, I think startups kind of like raising, there's a question there, right?\nAre these just meme coins?\nAre they commemorative?\nLike, can you give some kind of assurances to the purchasers of those if your startup actually makes money and returns some kind of revenue to them?\nUm, or is that towing the line to or is that getting like too far over the line um to like equity status?\nBut I I still think there's something interesting there.\nUm, I think retail is like has some latent demand for that type of product if if the right startups or businesses like are involved.\nIf it's just, you know, the next guy launching a memecoin, pretending uh it's a startup, then it's not quite the same.\nAre we bull posting believe as well?\nI'm not sure.\nI I'm uh I'm going to go with Boccaccio's famous statement, uh Gen 2 is always better than Gen One.\nUh, we'll see.\nI don't know if Believe is Gen two or if Gen two is the next iteration.\nWe'll have to see.\nLet's see.\nCool.\nAll right, we'll close it out there.\nUh, thanks for coming on, guys.\nAppreciate the chat.\nAnd, uh, we will see you all next time.\nUh, and we'll find out, I think, in a few days, whether some pro Pump predictions from earlier in the week turn out correct.\nUh, and we'll have to set a reminder for what, five, six months from now to see if Pump predictions for the end of the year turn out correct.\nUm, so we'll see you all then.\nThanks for watching.\n",
