  "cleanText": "I think builder codes in its truest, the most raw, insane kind of form will effectively put that to bed and make it look like kids selling lemonade outside because there is literally no product on planet earth, like not even Shopify is this simple.\nNot even Amazon is this simple.\nThere's no product on planet Earth right now that literally hands you $4 billion of liquidity, says, \"Hey, we're not going to charge you [ __ ] for this.\"\nAnd then you can go and make money on it.\nYou could charge up to 0.1% on the notional value of a per trade, and you could charge up to 1% on a spot trade.\nThere's literally not anything on the planet that does that at scale or even like on a micro level of this.\nSo yeah, builder codes alone should make Hyperliquid worth, you know, several other L1s combined.\nBuilder codes alone in their truest form.\nWhat's up, guys?\nJust wanted to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor, Aptos.\nWe'll hear more about how Bitcoin, DeFi, and Aptos is heating up later today.\nBut for now, let's get into the episode.\nWhat's up, guys?\nThis is Bokio, the bad host and the better host, Danny.\nUh, today we have a very, very important announcement for you.\nWe are hosting Permissionless in Brooklyn.\nUm, what dates?\nIt's going to be in June, June 24th through the 26th.\nVery good.\nUm, you can use code 0x10 to buy your tickets.\nUh, we're going to do lots and lots of stuff.\nUm, dinners, games, you'll get to meet the whole crew, the 0xResearch crew, hopefully a bunch of the Blockworks Research and other Blockworks crew and uh maybe a dunk tank.\nWe're going to have fun.\nUh whatever we can smooch off of Yano and Meo, we're going to do it.\nSo, if you are a 0xResearch listener, make sure to use code 0x10 to buy your tickets.\nDanny, any parting words?\nAnd we'll see you there.\nNothing said on 0xResearch is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens.\nThis podcast is forformational purposes only and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our opinions, not financial advice.\nPocaccio, Ryan, and our guests may hold positions in the company's funds or projects discussed.\nWhat's up, guys?\nWelcome back to another episode of 0xResearch.\nToday we have a packed podcast.\nI'm joined by Tolks, Monk, Max, and Omnia.\nI think everybody here has introduced themselves except for you, Sunonny.\nUm, do you want to give a short introduction of what you do, who you are, and then we can we can get started?\nSure.\nMy name is uh Sunonny, otherwise known as Monk on Twitter.\nI am an enterprise research analyst at Msari.\nNice to be bridging the gap here between Blockworks and Msari.\nThis is a this is a good uh this is a good breaking the bread moment.\nUm but yeah, been writing about Hyperliquid since I think last summer, so almost like a year ago now.\nUm I've dropped like three reports on Hyperliquid.\nOne quick report on uh on unit and probably best known for the valuation report that I did um saying that Hyperliquid should be worth like 12 to 30 billion when it was trading at like I don't know a dollar on AO.\nSo um there we go.\nVery good.\nVery good flex and dunk on everybody who didn't buy that at that time as well.\nUm yeah, Hyperliquid ends up bridging gaps and allows us to be friends.\nUm this pod is to the listener uh will mostly be about Hyperliquid.\nUm I'm that's the reason that we collected the brightest minds and Tulks and me um to talk about it before we I think the first way the first I I really don't know how to bridge into this because I never really do like specific topic pods with analysts but I think maybe the best way to start is Max, Omnia, Tolks, last time we chatted um we mentioned that we had a few fears about Hyperliquid, like what our bare cases was and what our bull case was.\nUm Omnia, one thing you mentioned was stable coins.\nUm no, sorry, Max, one thing you mentioned was stable coins.\nOmnia, you mentioned some stuff about HyperEVM talks.\nI can't remember what you and I said, brother.\nI'm sorry.\nUm but in general to the to the group of three apart from me, has anything happened um or not happened?\nLike do you think you were proven correct or not?\nUm, how do you think like the past 3 four months has been for Hyperliquid since we did the pod?\nI suppose I'll kick off with EVM related stuff.\nUh, people called HyperEVM a failure when it went live.\nAnd I think this is a pretty [ __ ] take honestly and and uh probably spicy, but I really don't care.\nI think it actually is uh very very much [ __ ] because of the fact that you know the Hyperliquid team did explicitly say that this is an alpha or beta of HyperEVM.\nIt is the first time that an EVM is being essentially wedged uh next to an exchange especially such a performant one that handles an insane amount of volume.\nI think people very much uh misunderstood the magnitude of what was done and Jeff put it really well when saying that a literal jet engine was changed in mid-flight.\nI think it is literally the equivalent of that onchain.\nUh and essentially this happened with minimal if not zero downtime.\nAnd the other day I put something out which is pretty funny.\nUm you know teams especially at the ecosystem level like to invest a lot of time, energy and obviously money, general resources, logos and whatever uh into giving some sort of upgrade to a network or some sort of like whatever catalyst they're creating for the network that will be a turning point.\nThey like to give it like all these cool code names and stuff like that.\nLike it's some worldchanging operation.\nAnd then Hyperliquid literally just announces on Discord, hey guys, network upgrade at such and such time on this day.\nExpect five minutes of downtime.\nSorry if this inconveniences you.\nI mean like these guys just operate at such a different capacity that people are just not used to.\nAnd I think this reflects at every single level by the way.\nIt's like it's just at a social level.\nIt's just extremely weird.\nSo people don't know how to price this uh because of that.\nAnd then obviously at the asset level which we'll talk on I'm sure later on in the pod but yeah I think just touching on the EVM point I think like one of the risks that I highlighted was the fact that uh EVM wouldn't get adoption like a as a general risk right like something people see um as like a risk and something I just wanted to be fair about myself as a builder on EVM like as a risk to myself and like you know the protocol that our team is developing it's like one risk is that it didn't it wouldn't get traction did I believe that no but the point being it's a risk can of course can't be naive.\nUm, and I think that have that risk is very much proven wrong.\nThe EVM has gotten a [ __ ] ton of traction and I did not expect Solana Trenchers to pop over anytime, you know, as quickly as they did and they have, which has been really interesting and not something I I factored in in the short term.\nSo anyway, I'll stop there.\nBut yeah, I hope that covers my part.\nUm, on my end, I I would say my biggest fear back in January was around, you know, whether Hyperliquid would just be allowed to compete on even terms uh with the rest of the industry.\nI I think that's proven out and I've been, you know, pleasantly surprised with how um, you know, crypto policy has been developing under the new Trump admin in particular.\nI think you know we've seen kind of uh representatives from all parts of the industry kind of contribute to some of these bills that are moving forward and some of the you know um discussions being had.\nUh so I I I personally you know view that risk as being smaller as it may have been back in January.\nUm and I would also just echo you know Omnia in that I I think the expectations around the EVM uh at that time were you know quite nebulous and it was deployed for the first time back in February I think around like a month after we did that podcast episode and it was a slow burn but today we're sitting at I I think 1.6 6 billion in in TVL looking at DeFi llama and that level of liquidity coming to uh the system has has been a significant boon in my opinion.\nSo between those two you know fears I would say we navigated it quite well.\nNo completely agreed.\nI um when I wrote about Hyperliquid like a month back um Sunny I've also written free reports.\nI don't want to be that guy, but just FYI, I one of the things that I wrote was that to me it it kind of made sense that Hyper the Hyper EVM would always kind of be a sidecart be because the the core hyper core is just so it makes sense for that to continue as the main product especially since it makes a lot of money and it's a very very good product.\nUm, and I always thought that hyper core would mainly be used for lending, margin, LSDs, um, collateral, etc.\nLike on that slow defi, let's say, um, but when I checked the data, it was actually a lot of, um, swapping.\nUm, AMM usage is quite high.\nI think at that time it was hypers swap.\nI'm not sure what it is now.\nUm, like the leader, it was also drip trade.\nSo NFTs were also quite popular.\nSo I was pleasantly shocked.\nAnd since then um this isn't data on high the hypervm is kind of tough.\nWe have some built out but from what I have seen anecdotally typically over the past let's say year if I'm in a group chat most people will be talking about Solana tokens.\nUm there's been I would say a shift over the past two months where it's still Salana dominated and then I think like if you're not in your Hyperliquid chats you'll see that in the general chats most of the time people are still talking about Salana trenches um like those Japanese soldiers that never left the island.\nUm, but it's like 10% 20% now are like chilling Hyperliquid HyperEBM tokens which I think is a pretty meaningful meaningful shift especially for something that's relatively new doesn't have the top specs.\nUm, I think they just got like the small block times to 1 second Omnia.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong because I know you post Yeah, literally 40 48 hours ago or something.\nYeah, it's not like the most performant chain, but like you mentioned, they've also been very explicit in that this isn't meant to be the most performant chain initially.\nLike, it's just something that they're building out on the side.\nUm, Omni, actually, one thing you mentioned was that they're not great at comms.\nWell, you didn't say this.\nI'm saying this, so, but I'm saying that they're not great at comms.\nUm in that they'll just launch an update um upgrade like a network upgrade for five minutes and then they'll like cut block times by half.\nUm I'm like you don't really see a lot of road map from their end or like a lot of this is our like final goal.\nOn the one end, that's kind of daunting, but on the other end, it's like you kind of trust that they're going to be working towards this as opposed to going out with this massive road map and saying, \"Yeah, we're going to like get into this.\"\nAnd then they never really do anything about it over the next three months.\nSo, and they also take feedback.\nWell, that's kind of the crazy part is like it's refreshing that they don't talk [ __ ] before it's actually done, which is great.\nBut the thing is they actually also take feedback because that that is like maybe a risk to add on to like what was uh what we discussed a few months back now it's like oh like you know they don't talk yeah sure but like do they take feedback and the reality is they do they take feedback from the discord channel they take feedback from people on telegram who want to list a certain coin or like trade something like they actually take way more feedback than people would realize but anyway just thought that was a cool caveat.\nNo no it's a good point.\nUm, one more thing I'm going to talk cut me off.\nNo, I mean I think uh I think our pod was it like 6 months ago now was it a lot of that stuff remains true.\nI think one of the biggest things for me um again we were trying to like hypothesize about bear cases without like actually wanting to you know be a bear.\nUm, but I think for me it was just like the points program.\nUm, we've we've we've just seen this the the perpex angle.\nWe've seen it done a thousand times in crypto and somebody was eventually going to get it right and to the point where it doesn't matter anymore about what anybody else does.\nAnd Hyperliquid has definitely done that and like you can put that argument to bed now.\nUm, but I think that, you know, you look at the the DEX to sex, the futures trade volume, you look at, you know, the per pro protocol, uh, the market share stuff that the block has.\nUm, they have good data on that.\nUm, but yeah, that was that was the main concern for me.\nI remember saying that like before we logged off the last pod and it was just like look we've seen per protocols have you know this kind of angle happened before and there are protocols that would have like dominant market share for you know a month two months three months while their points program was going on and we've seen that Hyperliquid again we talked about it six months ago like this is different from every other pro protocol and we've seen that played out.\nUm, so yeah, I think you can put that that argument to bed and you know, we'll talk about the the HyperEVM and and what that brings to the hype.\nUm, but the main downside I think to me was what is the potential for another deck to launch a points program?\nAnd honestly, like you see it nowadays with I'm sure everybody's familiar with lighter now and like people talk about that and um it's it's really generally just because they want the hype airdrop that that occurred.\nThey want that to happen again.\nUm but since then like everything has just been I mean hype has been the execution everything about the the chain the token like the buybacks everything is just it's it's amazing.\nSo yeah, um yeah, I think we can we can put that a lot of the bare arguments that we were kind of, you know, forced into and talking about 6 months ago.\nLike I think you can put\n\n\nPretty much all of those to bed. Bitcoin DeFi is heating up on Aptos. With nearly 400 million BTC assets on chain, Aptos users can now earn yield on their Bitcoin via Echo aBTC and OKX xBTC without the typical bridge risks and high fees. To explore BTC yield opportunities on Aptos, follow the link in today's show notes. As always, investments in blockchain technology involve risk. Terms and conditions apply. Do your own research.\n\nI just pulled up the chart. People didn't see it. Um, but sex to dex ratio is now at 25%. Um, I'm actually curious what you guys think. So, one of the things is that they've clearly been taking a lot of volume away from sexes. Um, it almost feels kind of stupid for it to be compared to other dexes at this point because it's like, I think it's at 90% now for the relevant dexes. Um, overall, it's like 80-85%. Um, yeah, Sunny, maybe this one you can speak a bit about, like, how do you think about competition in that space? Are you comparing it now to sexes? Um, or are you still like, this is just the per landscape is just going to keep growing and growing? How do you think about the HyperCore going forward in terms of growth?\n\nYeah, I, I think, um, I posted a thread, like, long-form tweet recently about this. Uh, I actually do think this is a reasonable fundamental bare case for Hyperliquid's growth trajectory going forward, which is that a lot of the perp volumes that you've seen it accumulate so far, a lot of that is just latent onchain demand from, like, the perp vacuum of not having a good onchain solution for it for basically since the inception of blockchains themselves. Um, and so now that we have a super performant, highly liquid onchain order book product in Hyperliquid, um, there are a lot of just natural user acquisition benefits of being like the only venue that is actually good and that actually works really well at a high level and can be even be compared to sexes to a certain extent. And I do think that's going to get harder on the perpetual side going forward because eventually, my guess is maybe around like 20 to 25% of Binance's volumes. Eventually, for derivatives, you're going to hit the point where you have to either win over users from another venue, that being centralized exchanges, or you have to create net new users on chain, which happens every day. Like, every day someone in the Misari office, like, hops on Hyperliquid for the first time, and within two weeks they're like the most degenerate perp trader I know. So, um, it, it's happening all the time, but it'll, it'll take time. And so, I do think at least on the perpetual side, you're going to hit this wall eventually where it gets much harder to break through. Yeah. From like 20% of Binance's perp volumes to like 25 to 30 to 40 to 50. I think this team can execute its way there. Um, but I think the real opportunity is actually on the spot side where you haven't really seen any performant onchain order books be able to take even onchain volumes from AMMs. Um, like if you look at where BTC is traded today, where ETH is traded today, where Soul is traded today, they're mostly through, they're mostly traded through, like, concentrated liquidity AMMs on like Orca, aerodrome, um, Uniswap V3. And so one, that's a big opportunity for Hyperliquid to start stealing some of that volume away from those venues, um, through its spot product with unit launching BTC, Soul, ETH, Farcoin. Uh, but two, like, that's just untapped potential that it has relative to Binance spot or relative to Sex Spot. Um, and they've obviously found incredible PMF routing spot transactions through their order books. And so we did the analysis a couple of months ago on centralized exchanges. Spot volumes tend to be around 30% of derivatives volumes. And so that's like an incremental 30% in volumes you could just add as like white space for Hyperliquid. So I think for up only growth trajectory, I'd be paying attention to spot on the perpetual side. I think it's going to be kind of like a slow grind eventually to get higher. But at the same time, I don't think any of these onchain competitors will have a chance at stealing any of Hyperliquid's share for a while.\n\nYeah, I think I have an interesting question for you guys, by the way, that has to touch on the spot side. So, you know, combined users between like just three top-of-mind exchanges, Coinbase, Binance, Private, etc., is like in the hundreds of millions, right? Hyperliquid is sub 1 million in terms of active or registered addresses. Um, obviously this could be several people controlling one address or whatever. So, obviously the volume per user is just honestly [ __ ] ridiculous. I think this is really not talked about enough, but that's that's separate to this point specifically is like, um, one thing that I think several community members, myself, Max, many others, right? have done or like how should I say, have more so taken an interesting step in this kind of direction of like teams actually tging on Hyperliquid or factoring in the Hyperliquid exchange as part of their listing strategy because I think, you know, I don't know if teams are tired enough of getting rinsed for like a $5 million cash fee and then 5% of their supply or something. I don't, I don't think they're tired enough, honestly. Um, I don't know what gets them there. Is it the fact that like the Binance perp listing or listing at all just equals like death for your token? Uh, probably at least in the short term. Uh, we're seeing this in a lot of tokens happen now for the most part. Like, you get every exchange listing and nobody really gives a [ __ ] anymore. Everyone just wants the Hyperliquid perp listing, which is 100% true. Like, there's several tokens that I would literally never touch with like a 40,000-foot pole, but I would 100% trade it on Hyperliquid, right? And that's just me. And by the way, like, I'm very much in the, you know, Monk was talking about new onchain users in the Misari office every day. Like one of us, you know, like I'm literally the definition of a perp [ __ ]. Um, I'm, I've said this in many other, uh, you know, talks as well, which is like, for me with regards to perp trading, I, I guess I'm like the Hyperliquid dream user because, uh, for me, if like there's 40x leverage available and like why would I use 10? Like, why would I use 39? There's like an extra piece of, you know, meat to squeeze off. So anyway, um, I think there's a lot of use out there like that, right? And there's like a crazy correlation between memecoin traders and perp traders with actually crazy more crazy, uh, difference and kind of like, I don't know, almost efficiency. It's like they get the same kick or dopamine rush, but without the um, quote unquote, hard work that goes goes into meme DD, which is like, oh, did the dev set up TG? Did the dev dev pay dex? Like, did the TG get hacked? Did they set up mods? So anyway, I think perp ultimately, I'm sure everyone here shares this view or at least some version of it, but perps do become like the, you know, onchain, I don't know, uh, end-user kind of end game in terms of like degeneracy. But I think in in one way, too, like teams owe it to themselves to basically secure a listing on Hyperliquid for a fraction of what they would pay elsewhere, and unit can of course help them do that. But like imagine like the funding rate trade for, I'll just say it, like Mega ETH or something like that or Bara on on Hyperliquid, like these exchanges would get a massive, uh, chunk out of them eaten, honestly. At least I, I personally think we're starting to see some pretty interesting numbers with, uh, the three majors that unit has brought over, including Fartcoin, which does ridiculous perp volume as well. Uh, anyway, I wanted to bring this up and see what you guys thought about that because I thought it was a cool direction, not talked about enough, not in threads, not in, you know, shows. So anyway, just throwing it out there. But by the way, I have talked to makers about this, like market makers, and they do corroborate this. They're like, \"Dude, the hype, the Hyperliquid flow is like the most profitable flow we've ever seen because because everyone's like James Wyn is out here with a billion-dollar Bitcoin notional position just like with no real thesis. I mean, I'm not going to He had a thesis, but I mean, this guy is not Jump Crypto, did he? Yeah. Yeah. But he's not like Jump Crypto or Liquid Fund or any of these like large sophisticated players that are on like centralized exchanges. And so they're dying right now to get on Hyperliquid. Some of them can't because of compliance issues, but they're like, \"Dude, this is beautiful, like extractable flow that we want to market make for, um, because it's just so good.\" Like onchain, onchain dens are just so, so much more, uh, well, the, the liquidity, the liquidity you're talking about, too, like, I mean, that's a tried and true thing, like in crypto, like liquidity begets liquidity, like once you have that, like, it's, it's the same thing with it, it's similar to, you know, the onchain coins, like you'll see, um, you'll see some of the best onchain coins like launch with, and they'll have high liquidity, so what else can come in? Like, I mean, it reminds me of, uh, I mean, the first thing that comes to mind is like, boom back last summer. But like the reason that that went insane is because, you know, the liquidity pool was at say, like three, four, 5 million compared to your run-of-the-mill coin that launches that is at, you know, 250, 350, 400k liquidity. Like liquidity begets liquidity. And that is a thing that in crypto, like, that, that's it's still like somehow a little bit underrated. And like I think the the perp market for that is like, I, I know we're skeptical a little bit about like how much perps can grow, but like I am, I'm in the camp that that that perps, you know, they're going to, the, the sign is going to continue. Like there's a reason that Robin Hood and Coinbase and the US in general, like just, you know, allow legislation for for purpose to be liquid, and um, we'll see how that develops, but like that liquidity is the number one thing for me that like makes a difference between, you know, something that can continue growing and something that can't. Um, so the the spot market, like on Hyperliquid, like that, that, um, I don't know, it, it'll take a little, like, I'm more excited personally about the perp growth because of the liquidity than I am about the spot market, and like the spot market, like they have plenty of liquidity on there, but, um, once that, like, starts, starts growing, like, you know, how it does in in AMM, like, then, then you're really cooking with fire.\n\nYeah. I, um, sorry, one thing I wanted to mention because you brought up that we're onboarding more people. Um, you know what I've been thinking about? Are you guys familiar with Axiom? I assume most people here use PVP trade, but so Axiom does both Solana and Hyperliquid. And I feel like that's actually quite a good, um, way to get this new user base of people who are primarily in the Solana trenches, um, to get into PERPS because it's relatively seamless as seamless as you can make, um, solo type of liquid. Um, and that's one thing that I think we wrote about it two weeks ago, and I was thinking about that, it's like a whole new class. And if you guys ever go on Twitter and you see these people who are in the Solana trenches, it's not like you, you and me. It's, it's like 19-year-olds with .5 soul in a dream. It's, it's legitimately dumb flow. Um, and like you mentioned, that's what people want. And I mean, these people can be onboarded potentially. I don't know how many of them are on Telegram to be honest with you. I think most of them typically use Phantom. But either way, it's a good growth revenue. One thing that was actually kind of shocking is, um, Axium makes, I think, like 95% of its money off of Solana and like sub 5% from Hyper.\n\nDude, I think it's that's a great point. It's even more, I think, like, I think only 50 bits of their, uh, revenue has actually come from builder codes on that builder, which is pretty crazy. Yeah. Um, yeah, because they can't charge the 1% fees they charge on a lot of transactions with with the cap. But, um, uh, but I, I think that's actually a good, um, add-on to the conversation, right? Because, you know, whether we're talking about perp, perp, perp, perp, perp, perp, perp, perp, perp, perp, perp volumes or spot volumes, um, the reality is that, you know, continued growth is coming from entities like Axium that integrate Hyperliquid as a liquidity backend. I, I think often this discourse focuses too much on, you know, Hyperliquid as an exchange alternative, right? People compare it to individual exchanges or individual, you know, perp protocols, um, but with the builder code mechanism, right, that allows someone to submit transactions on a user's behalf and and charge, you know, up to a certain fee threshold for doing so, which is different for for spot versus for S, we're basically getting to a point where you can have unlimited organizations, you know, do putting the work in for user acquisition and user retention. You know, I, my hope is that within a year's time, right, like the builder code ecosystem looks like a proto Shopify, right? Where where two beady schmucks from some far-flung part of the world, you know, could, you know, spin up a billboard, attract 10,000 users and, you know, cover their rent that way, right? Like that is, I think, the the true bull case for Hyperliquid is that it just becomes this liquidity layer, um, for so much and in so many different niches. And Axiom PVP, right, these teams have kind of shown what what builder codes can do, and you know, there's a lot I think coming to market over, um, over the next few months as well. Uh, so I, I'm personally interested to see at which point, you know, longtail centralized exchanges even just kind of throw in the towel and say, hey, we can have pure profit by forcing our users, um, you know, to pay the fees we want them to pay, but then just delegating our back end basically to Hyperliquid, right? Like that can be pure profit, uh, and cut out, you know, 50, 60, 70% of the cost structure of a centralized exchange. Um, and yeah, I assume, you know, someone will eventually do that. I think the math checks out at a certain point, and it'll be more than just, you know, Telegram bots, uh, making use of builder codes, it'll, it'll be, you know, the, the\n\n\nKind of centralized exchanges people have already onboarded to that that make that call as well.\nYeah, I think just quickly here, I think like if you if you want to look at real users on chain today that are actually paying to use a service and not just there for like some sort of incentivized reward structure, it's just Solana, Trenchers, and Hyperliquid, like traders.\nAnd those are basically the two real user cohorts in crypto that I could see right now, um, outside of like people that are just like doing stable swaps or or dumping TVL into Ethereum.\nAnd so this is like builder codes are direct pipeline into I think like a top two user cohort in crypto.\nUm, and and people are seeing this, like I think I've spoken to multiple frontends now where I basically like they're just like, yeah, these are the only two ecosystems we even want to focus on at this point.\nYeah, it used to be base and Solana.\nOne thing I want to add is before I talks, um, I think most people don't realize that a lot of regional exchanges just use Binance on the back end or like Binance order books on the back end.\nSo the builder code doesn't really catch on very naturally when people explain like how this could be used.\nBut a lot of the time if you're random regional exchange in some like country that you're not, you don't have your own order book, you're just using Binance on the back end.\nSo that's something to to keep in mind.\nAnd they pay a ridiculous amount, too.\nLike it's not as simple as you just plug and play, right?\nWhich is which is which would make it really ridiculous killer use case.\nBut there's also so much that goes into it, right?\nWhich is like local jurisdictional licensing and other forms of setup.\nI mean, it's actually ridiculous.\nWhereas like you guys remember the YouTube era with like Amazon FBA and like every [ __ ] and and their friend would sell like some sort of some course saying like, \"I'll show you how to make like blah blah blah,\" like you know the ecourse uh e-commerce uh e-course guys.\nI think builder codes in its truest most raw insane kind of form will effectively put that to bed and make it look like kids selling lemonade outside because there is literally no product on planet earth, like not even Shopify is simple.\nWell, not even Amazon is this simple.\nThere's no product on planet Earth right now that literally hands you $4 billion of liquidity, says, \"Hey, we're not going to charge you [ __ ] for this, and then you can go and make money on it.\nYou could charge up to 0.1% on the notional value of a per trade, and you could charge up to 1% on a spot trade.\"\nThere's literally not anything on the planet that does that at scale or even like on a micro level of this.\nSo, yeah, builder codes alone should make Hyperliquid worth, you know, several other L1s combined.\nBuilder codes alone in their truest form, especially if you attach the [ __ ] premium to it that, you know, most other things trade out today, especially, you know, when when factoring in revenue.\nSo, that's not even talking about the exchange.\nThat's not even talking about HyperEVM.\nThat's not even talking about, you know, crazy things like HIP-3.\nIt's not talking about the fact that you don't need to pay a market maker for a spot listing.\nIt's not talking about not needing to pay, you know, $5 million and a ridiculous amount of your token supply to centralized exchanges.\nI mean, this leads into the overarching thesis that nobody knows how to price Hyperliquid, a objective fact.\nYeah.\nNo, I mean I definitely agree with that and like I think what you're talking about there, like one of the the like core things for me is, you know, the spot the spot listings of coins that are say, you know, between 50 to 100 million to maybe 200 million.\nLike these coins, like whether people want to, you know, accept that they're eventually going to go to zero, scams, whatnot.\nLike the spot listing is a major thing.\nLike you I'm sure you guys see it in chats, you see it in in um on Twitter.\nLike one of the catalysts that people realize for spot coins is like, \"Oh, Binance could potentially list this.\nLike Coinbase could potentially list this.\"\nLike that is a major catalyst for what you know what what the coin can go to.\nAnd so when Omnia, when you're talking about like HIP-3, like I I think it's still severely underrated by the market in the sense that anybody can pay for whatever listing.\nUm, and again, like that is a catalyst that people talk about endlessly in chats is like, \"Oh, if this could get spotless on Binance, if this could get spot listing on Coinbase,\" and then it's like, \"Hey, here's this protocol where you can get if if you want the spot listing, you can pay for it,\" you know, and like you're talking about with the amount that Binance and Coinbase and I mean, we've seen these threads on Twitter, too, like about how much they siphon from either the token supply or what it costs to list a token, like and then hey, here's this permissionless protocol that you can list any token on at any price, like that is still seems fundamentally undervalued to me because the the market, the amount of conversation that happens about the listing payments, um, what Binance and Coinbase, you know, require for a listing, like that you guys are aware, like this this is an endless conversation on CT.\nAnd so then there comes this protocol where actually you can pay a set amount x amount for a listing and that's it.\nYou're done with.\nAnd I just think um I think that aspect is severely underrated because again, like I mean you see the pump swap volumes, you see the photon volumes, you see the axion volumes.\nLike again, these coins could be worth essentially nothing, but like there's a desire to trade them and Hyperliquid is set up to be in a position where you could get spot listings, you could get purple listings.\nLike that's open finance, like everything they wish they could be.\nEssentially, the HIP-3 is you have to buy HYPE to stake it, right?\nCan somebody give me a basic basic explanation of this?\nI'm very stupid.\nSo very simplified a lot.\nUh so with HIP-3, anyone who has a million stake type available to them, um, would be in a position to then participate in perp market deployment rights.\nSo every 31 hours, you know, the the right to deploy a perp would go to um uh those who have put up that bond.\nSo if you know the five of us each had put up the bond, the five of us could participate in those per markets.\nUm, if you win that auction, you are basically responsible for hosting, you know, the the price oracle that that perk market uses.\nIf you know it doesn't work right, um, your bond could be slashed by validators, right?\nThat and that's social consensus essentially.\nUm, and I would just add that the main thing to keep in mind, too, is that, you know, this is a decentralization vector.\nSo, HIP-3s would not be hosted on HL.xyz, which is just one of many interfaces to the Hyperliquid blockchain.\nRight?\nSo, this basically opens up uh the purpose market business, um, you know, to anyone who can host this type of market on Hyperliquid.\nRight?\nThe you know the the fees are there for the taking uh basically and um I would just add, you know, obviously one million HYPE, $40 million, that's quite steep.\nUm, I would personally just, you know, approach this conversation with the expectation that, you know, lending or leasing markets uh will reflect this and it becomes possible for you know, credible actors to to source that without you know, having $40 million of directional exposure on respective balance sheet.\n0xResearch per coming to a front end near you.\nWe are not doing that.\nMax, Max, before we pivot, um, that's spot markets too, right?\nBecause I think you said just park markets, but spot markets is HIP-1.\nSo that is uh priced in HYPE now.\nIt used to be priced in USDC.\nUSDC same as all other fees would basically just go towards the assistance fund and just perma buy HYPE.\nAnd in this case now HIP-1 uh since the tokens are priced in HYPE as well, like the auctions themselves uh which significantly bumped the p like the cost per auction now, funny enough, uh instead of a 10,000 USDC floor, it's now a 500 HYPE floor, um, you know, the auctions have very quietly ripped back near six figure range, funny enough, so that's been hence.\nAnd that that makes, I mean, that's everything I'm talking about and I think that we've alluded to about, you know, the other exchanges, like I mean, these these exchanges are, you know, they're juggernauts, like, you know, coin is listed on NASDAQ, like Binance is, you know, they're one of arguably the most profitable companies in the world, like alongside Tether, like these these companies are that big for a reason.\nAnd so when you can when you have some type of, you know, whatever amount of HYPE it is, like to list a spot or per, like that that just I don't know, it It's an amazing thing to see in my mind because um you just you open the the floodgates to everything.\nTo you made a really funny point regarding uh BNB a second ago or like Binance in general.\nSo Coinbase obviously just has coin equity, but you know, buy bit obviously Hello Mantle uh Binance with BNB, etc.\nUm, so interestingly enough, um, you know, CZ made a funny post the other day which was like, \"Oh, I had no idea that we had 75 or whatever the [ __ ] the the APR was to to B&amp;B token holders per perm.\"\nAnd it's like I realized the other day that this is the most all right buddy moment I've ever seen in my life probably because this is literally them not just it it's very much like the big short moment in the se in the movie where it's like why are they um why are they laughing?\nIt's like oh they're not they're bragging.\nWell, it it was literally like that comment because this is purely revenue extracted from token projects that list on Binance.\nThis is nothing else.\nThis is just Binance launchpool APR essentially and that comes from you know you name it insert project basically paying the cartel extortion fee of getting listed on Binance that just goes straight to uh launchpool stakers which you know obviously speculative but like who knows how much of that is actually controlled uh internally, right?\nLike that's obviously never going to be that's never going to see the light of day, right?\nWhereas the the backwards, you know, massive middle finger to\nYou're gonna get me killing me, dude.\nDon't say [ __ ] like that on the podcast.\nYeah.\nAll right, cut cut the cut the mic.\nBut the the backward reverse middle finger to that is literally HYPE using essentially 100% of its revenue to buy back HYPE.\nUh, and you know, I I use the term buyback very loosely because I don't know why it's always irked me that term in this case because tokens were literally never sold.\nThey were just distributed as as we see on Max's headline here.\nThey were literally never sold, right?\nLike they they weren't sold to the market.\nIt's not like they were placed on like infinite asks or anything like that and just like sold off into like some sort of concentrated liquidity curve.\nIt was literally just given to everyone.\nUh no market makers, no OTC deals, no venture rounds.\nSo what do you call this?\nLike you don't even call it a buyback because they were never sold.\nYou call it some other some sort of I literally can't even call it anything.\nS tier revenue crew.\nI don't know.\nGas fee burn.\nI I mean HyperCore runs on trading fees as as its de facto gas fees and so far we've just been burning half basically or the USDC half uh on spot and you know whatever fees are are being generated by the per.\nSo with nearly 400 million BTC onchain supported by a secure, fast, and affordable move VM environment, Aptos has become the BTC growch chains.\nUsers can now earn yield on their bitcoin via EOS aBTC and OKX's XBTC without the typical bridge risks and high fees.\nWith support from Echo, OKX, and STAX's SBTC, Apptos is the place to go for best-in-class yield on Bitcoin.\nTo explore BTC yield opportunities on APOS, follow the link in today's show notes.\nAs always, investments in blockchain technology involve risk.\nTerms and conditions apply.\nDo your own research.\nI want to refocus this on one specific thing.\nUm, I think this one will be probably different takes.\nUm, valuing HYPE.\nUm, when I did it, I'm going to start off with Sunny.\nUm, and then we're going to do a whip round just because he has the valuation for.\nActually, I don't know any of you guys background, so you might be better at it.\nBut, um, in my mind, it makes the most sense to do some of parts.\nThat's what I've done in the past.\nUm, and HyperEVM is quite little.\nUm, obviously because it earns less money.\nUm, but to me that seemed like the the thing that could have potentially more growth just because as you mentioned, I'm also in that camp.\nI think you can take volume away from sexes.\nBut I do think that there is a certain like it's a crowded space.\nThese massive um industry like these massive companies already control so much of the market share.\nIt's a tough space.\nUm so to me it made sense that the HyperEVM would have to grow a lot more.\nUm and I basically did a sum of parts but I'm curious like how you guys are thinking about it.\nUm if that makes sense.\nYeah, I did uh some of the parts too from my first report and basically like um and the reason why is because if you look at like average pricing across crypto, like Hyperliquid looks like an expensive asset if you compare it to DEX's, but it looks like a cheap asset if you compare it to L1's.\nAnd that's because it's both.\nIt's both enshrined.\nAnd um when I did it, I think I threw like a very conservative multiple on projected perex revenues.\nThis was before spot um like unit actually launched like spot BTC.\nUm and I think I got to like base case 8 bill for the perpex and then I slapped on like a 5 billion L1 premium because that's where like Aptos was trading around and that was before the EVM was out.\nNow when I look at I I just revisited the numbers today.\nSo, Hyperliquid already blasted through my bullcase.\nLike, it's like in terms of volumes, it's actually outperformed my bullcase dramatically.\nUm, I think it hit what I expected it to do around like 2027 already.\nUm, and then, uh, and and that's because spot is now like a huge contributing factor as well with like HYPE BTC and ETH.\nUm, and then the L1 is now a top 10\n\n\nChain by TVL. And so, you've got to, you've got to rate both of those higher. Um, and I think this is basically, I think the way I think about most crypto evaluations is the fundamental stuff is kind of the floor. Um, and then the speculative premium kind of emerges on a comps basis where you're basically looking at what can HYPE flip in a speculative environment, and when everything changes, it goes back to, okay, like what does HYPE actually earn? Um, and so in a speculative environment, I would be looking at something like, we already flipped Sweet. I think so, like BNB, um, as like a next target, maybe even Soul eventually. I think it can get there. Uh, but from a fundamental basis, like I think we're trading at close to, if not below, where, if you want to do like an academic sum of the parts, like where it should be valued around like 30 to 40 billion or so. Um, and by the way, like the team is constantly adding more sneaky valuation drivers into the HYPE asset. And so HIP-3, which we talked about, if you think about it, right, let's say HYPE theoretically goes to like zero. It's like it's trading at 1 cent, but all the users are still on Hyperliquid. And so if you can deploy HIP-3 per and make like, I don't know, millions of dollars off of the organic usage on the platform, then it's a no-brainer to stake that 1 million HYPE if HYPE is like ridiculously cheap. And so there are all these things that like, and if you're like a market maker or you're a trader, and you're very, very active on Hyperliquid as a platform, you're also going to want to buy and stake HYPE because at some point those benefits from the staking tiers, like the fee reductions, are going to outweigh the cost of actually buying and staking that HYPE. And so there are all these like sneaky ways that like Jeff is linking utility and uh, uh, utility to the token that I think will also play a factor. But if we want to do it in the most academic sense possible as a research analyst, I think of some of the parts makes the most sense. And you look at some of these L1s. I mean, there are L1's. I mean, I think AVAC is below Hyperliquid in terms of the HyperEVM, in terms of TVL, or right around that range. And AVAC is, I don't know what is that now, like a $20 billion protocol. Yeah. Massive like that.\nYeah. Sorry, finish up, Sunny. Um, and yeah, the last thing I'll say, which Omnia has like kind of addressed before, is nobody knows how to value HyperCore. Like people, people have no idea what it is. Like I've talked to VCs, I've talked to liquid funds, very good ones understand it fully. But if you think about crypto's top use cases, this is the use case. Like trading per trading spot is basically like 90% of what makes revenue onchain today. And so there's no reason why HyperCore itself can't be valued as one of the like top two, top three alternative crypto assets in the universe. And uh, I, I'll end it there. I'll let everyone else take the floor.\nAnother big factor is the fact that Hyperliquid is the only one in what is it, top 10 now, or just outside of top 10? I think top 11 that doesn't actually emit tokens or could have like some sort of hidden supply somewhere. It is literally removing 2% of current circulating supply per month with its fees. And this was only accelerated by like a massive uh fee bump. I mean, it's not that massive. It's not like extractive. It's still extremely cheap compared to other places. Um, but like Monk, for example, when you put out your report, or Bach, the same thing for you. Like we didn't have these fees to actually base anything off of. So now like the fee increase has been significant. Whereas like a $1 million day, 500k day in terms of revenue was pretty normal before. It's like more like 2 or 3 million now, which is pretty insane. Obviously coupled with a ton of volume. Like now $10 billion in a day is like considered, wow. Like that's that's cool today.\nNice. When 20, you know, something like that. Again, not just for the sake of, yeah, volume must continue to go up forever. No, it's just the fact that the team continues to stay relatively on point uh with regards to listings. More and more people get onboarded. Monk made a really underrated point uh earlier actually that I think just the general CT mind cannot comprehend compliance and just the ability to onboard the Hyperliquid is so misunderstood by the general public. Like 99.98% of people don't understand that lit people are forced sidelined because of their mandates on on every single part of HYPE today, which is like buying it, investing into anything on it, I guess, because like there's what do you do, right? Like there's that, and then the third one is actually trading on it. So how do you do it, right? Like there's several market makers like Flowes, and I've seen Winter uh recently that offer OTC services. Um, I mean, so like the these really interesting solutions have had to be crafted because HyperCore is this nent, completely unique network that people have just had to essentially like uh, Max and I had a joke for a very long time, and I think this is going to be very relevant to this. We had a joke for a very long time where uh, VC and liquid fund uh managers essentially would start to very soon get really angry messages from their LPs. I don't think that specifically has started yet, but I think the the kind of, I guess you could say, part two, the micro version of that joke as well has been that uh, custodians would start to get really angry messages from their clients, and this has started. Uh, so there are several really large custodians that are coming to support HyperEVM and eventually HyperCore. One, one quick, t, one quick point on that. If you look at these liquid fund returns, one, most of them are not that good. Two, the ones that are good are usually driven by like betting on the asset for that specific period. So in the last last few years, it was sold. If the next few years the asset is HYPE and you don't have exposure to HYPE, you're going to get absolutely killed. And so you're going to figure out how to expand your mandate to to to buy Hyperliquid. Like I think it just has to be. If other funds are figuring it out, then you have to figure it out at some point. And so it's, it's, it's more of a question of when and and not how. Not to mention there's stuff Hyperliquid could do fundamentally to improve like the compliance situation.\nThe, I guess what I would add to this conversation is just when we think about valuation frameworks and what makes sense versus what doesn't, right? I think the underlying assumption there is that there are forced deployers of capital, and in crypto, you know, we have it now for Bitcoin, right? Like things like IBIT or MSTR, right? Like are kind of becoming more and more within the mandate of certain trify allocators. But in crypto outside of Bitcoin, we're looking at a very momentum driven asset. And so in my mind, you know, I would say, I, I don't really have like a price target for for me. It's more, you know, what does the the marginal demand profile look like at any given point in time, and what does the amount of leverage in the system look like at any given point in time. And I think what makes HYPE very intriguing from that perspective, right, is even with the growth uh of the HyperEVM and the usage of DeFi applications on it, we essentially have, you know, what, 13 billion worth of collateral available in the form of HYPE at the moment. I want to say somewhere on the order of 600, 700 million of that has been deployed, you know, to borrow stables against and what have you. And that's about it.\nAnd at the same time, right, you have the, you know, assistance fund mechanism basically eating away at circulating supply at all times. Um, I think most, last time I checked, right, like we would have eaten away the entire circulating supply within 5 years. Compare that to literally any other asset in this industry, right? And it's just like unparalleled.\nUm, so I think as we talk about valuation, as HYPE becomes more and more consensus across the industry, um, you know, I do think the the animal spirits have yet to to be deployed here. Um, and I would just make the point, right, for for those listeners that you know, have been around for a few cycles, when you look at kind of the leveraged parabas that played out for for assets in the past, you know, whether it was like BNB, Sol, right, those were all in my mind kind of like supply side crises, right? There was just a ton of demand for these assets and a lot of leverage and things exploded.\nUm, the whole time though, people were dumping, right? Like how many ICOs were dumping ETH in 2017? How many insiders were dumping the whole way up on those types of assets back then? Um, you know, in 2011, for example, and now we finally have an asset that, you know, has a deflationary rate of 15% that's acting as a collateral, you know, foundation uh for for the ecosystem that's getting built out here.\nYou know, we just have not seen that before. Um, so I, I personally track, you know, certain metrics like, you know, how long would it take for the circulating supply to get bought back, right? And I think that's probably going to be one of the more useful, you know, multiples or kind of just north stars going forward here. Um, because it is such a peculiar asset and what is already a peculiar asset class.\nI think that makes sense. I actually wrote like a bearish report on buybacks a couple of, a couple of months ago, and then people were asking me, okay, like why are you bearish buybacks but bullish Hyperliquid? And I was like, well, I think what differentiates like a bad buyback program and a good buyback program is whether the protocol actually makes revenue, and no one makes revenue like Hyperliquid. And so that's like a big differentiator. Like if you can actually buy back the entirety of your circulating supply, then, then yeah, that might be more effective than someone that's doing like 50 bips like uh, every quarter.\nAnother thing there is that if you're like, I think if Hyperliquid was at 10% um, market share in per, then I'd say maybe spend that money on acquiring new users somehow. But I think like my argument has, so there's two camps in that, at least in like Blockworks Research, is that one says you should just be reinvesting as much of your revenue as possible. Um, I think the more realistic take, which is also my take, which is why it's the better take, is that you should percent in either case, because crypto, like it or not, it is very much narrative driven still. Um, and I think the buyback is is a good narrative because it shows that your token acrews at least some form of value. Um, it's not as efficient as other ways of um, like I think in equities at least, I don't know about in crypto, it's like historically not as efficient as other ways of um, giving acral to token holders or equity holders or whatever. But I think it's like in the case of Hyperliquid, I think it works in most cases. I think buybacks work.\nUm, that's been my overall take. Tolks, do you want to give a little\nNo, I mean, I would uh, I would agree with a lot of parts that everybody said. Um, I also am, am very, um, I'd say just aware of what the market is doing, too, because I think you should always be aware of that, too. And Bach, I know you can pull up the the HYPE Soul chart.\nUm, you can pull up, you know, HYPE BTC. Like, I think, I think these things are important because it's also what the market values. And like, yeah, maybe you can argue um, HYPE is a little expensive here, but like you're talking about a token that if it doubles, it'll enter the top 10 of crypto tokens. And a double right now is like, you know, that's that's not something anybody is necessarily pricing in. Um, I think the the, I tow the line between like the fundamental aspect of things is very important, like you were talking about Bach with Blockworks Research, like there's, you know, kind of a divide between what is, you know, what are the fundamentals and what is the narrative. Like I remember talking six months ago when we had the initial HYPE pod, like in my bull case was not only the product, what it offers, the buybacks and everything, but it was also if Sooie goes to XY Z, then HYPE goes to ABC. Like, and people can think that these ration are, you know, they're, they're not smart, but like that's just how crypto markets work. And like at some point at the end of the day, like you have to like the fundamental cap, like I, I love that. I, I love getting into the nitty-gritty of the fundamentals, but at some point you have to understand what drives these markets, and what drives these markets is maybe 10% fundamentals, if that. Like, of course, in a bare market, they become more important, and like I think HYPE and, you know, if we go into a bare market, like HYPE will be um, one of the better tokens you can look at and say, hey, they buy this amount back, they still have x amount of users, you know, their spot volume for this. Like there, the perp trading is not going to stop. Like all of that is important.\nUm, but yeah, so I, I just look at the top 10, and I'm like, you know, HYPE's at uh, 13 right now on CoinGecko, and it's like, it would literally take a double to get into the top 10. Like that for me is simple enough to understand what the bull case is. And I know that's, you know, that's throwing out a lot of everything we talked about for the past, you know, 55 minutes, but like that [ __ ] unfortunately matters. You know, unfortunately, fortunately, depends on your view. Like that stuff matters in crypto. And you know, we can all want a future where it doesn't matter, but at in the current environment, like it matters. And again, like going back to what we talked about 61 a skill, it's just like if BTC is at is at X, then HYPE is probably going to be at Y. And you know, if Sooie goes to X, then uh, then HYPE is going to be at Y. And if Soul is at, you know, $80 billion FTV, like, okay, then what is the fair comp for HYPE? Like the the comps matter. And I think the higher that um, BTC and Soul and ETH go, like I think the higher that the targets for for HYPE get. And I know that's very um, I don't know, not practical, I guess. But like again, if you're ignoring that stuff in crypto, like I think you're investing and looking at the space in a wrong way. Like I would love for the day when fundamentals are the only thing that matters. And\n\n\nLike, eventually, I think we'll get there, but in the meantime, like the comps going higher like that, you see going up in a straight line like that's the best thing you can ever want as a hype holder in my opinion.\nYeah, completely agreed.\nI think most people recognize that.\nI don't know if I would say 10% this year, but it's definitely, but you know what I mean.\nYeah, completely agree with you.\n100% agree with you.\nYeah, I'm, I would just, I'll end it with saying like, I'm, I'm bullish hype, like, and again, like, you can look at like when we have that selloff going into the the tariff [ __ ], like look at what the strongest performers are, and like hype has tripled since then.\nLike to me, that is all you need to know.\nI think for the longest time, um, in previous, like, in 2023, like when Soul was going up, I think a lot of people just ignored it and thought like, you know, but there was some signal in there, and then Soul ended up being the top performer for, you know, the next two years.\nLike, there is signal, and I, if you ignore everything, you ignore fundamentals, you ignore, you know, the price of every asset, the FTV, everything, look at what bounces the hardest from the bottom, and it's very clear that hype was that token this year.\nAnd I think there's a lot of similarities between Soul in 2023 and hype now.\nAnd again, that has no comment on what those tokens offer, what the product offers.\nIt's just what the market wants to bid the most, and that is more important than the fundamentals in a lot of, a lot of times.\nGood thing we have the uh, Hyperliquid marketing machine.\nWe're all part of the the SCOP.\nYeah, the marketing department.\nWhen, when marketing, when marketing dev, any updates?\nBut no, like it's, it's a very, a very crucial point to think of is like what bounces the hardest, and like hype was the thing that bounced the hardest.\nAnd to me, like you can be bullish on an asset, but until something like that bounce happens, you're not necessarily, like at least in my mind, like you're not necessarily convicted in your beliefs until you see that bounce.\nAnd then you're like, okay, not only am I right about the fundamentals of this asset, about what the growth trajectory could be, but also the market wants to bid it the hardest when everything falls.\nAnd that is, that is just crucial.\nI wanna, I want to take us to the fundamentals one time, and then I'm gonna end it.\nUm, but before I get yelled at by the rest of the research team, hype, HyperEVM.\nSo I, I asked our, we have a data site.\nI asked Rod, who was kind enough to share with me some of the work that they started doing.\nThis is not complete, and it might not be perfectly accurate, to be honest with you.\nUm, if you can see, I can zoom in a bit, but um, hype is over the past month, it's at 1 mil, um, rev, which is priority tips plus base fees.\nUm, that is half of Arbitrum, but it is ahead of Avalanche, Polygon, Opt, zkSync, Polygon, zkm.\nUm, it is not very impressive.\nI'm not going to lie to you guys, but I think this um, kind of shifts perspective a bit is that the growth over the past two weeks just has just been incredible.\nAnd I think part of this is people getting tired of the same old games on certain chains.\nPart of it is just that when you launch a chain, um, who talked about this?\nOne of you guys talked about this in that people, um, when you talk to builders, they're building on several chains.\nSo originally it was, I think, like for the 2023, it was base plus Solana, typically people focused on as a developer.\nUm, more recently, I think a lot of people are focusing on Hyperliquid, um, and base and Solana still, obviously, because these are still very important ecosystems.\nUm, and I think as more of those products come online, um, such as Kinetic, hopefully at some point, um, one right pre-ompile.\nBoach, this is, this is for, this is basically what occurs to stakers, right?\nThis is not, this is not what accrues to stakers.\nThis is, so it's different from the Solana model who's accruing the value.\nYes, yes, I, I actually need to look at this because I don't want to get it wrong.\nI'm not sure if HyperEVM network fees are burned, they are probably.\nOkay, so if they're burned, they're kind of accruing in that they're just burnt.\nYeah, it's, I think it's a completely different, like, accrual model compared to to Solana, which if you're a staker on Solana, like, you're, you're looking at rev, and you're trying to calculate like what you can get as a Solana validator staker.\nIf you're uh, if you're on Hyperliquid, then you want to own the token, um, because yeah, hype is accreating that value back to the community.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSome people have argued to distri some of this cash to like bakers and and stuff like that.\nBut DYDX did this.\nI, I believe it was like 11% APR, and we all know how that went.\nThe last uh, before I forget, the last bullish thing I'll say about hype is, um, you can't, we live in a world where in the crypto world where alts continuously emit new tokens, you know, over and over and over, like it, that is the endless debate on CT about what is the supply of this, what is the supply of that, what's coming online, what's, you know, a year from now, two years from now.\nI don't think people appreciate enough, like it, it's um, it's it should be appreciated more that, you know, the supply of hype is known, what is out there is known, what is coming in the future is known, like all of that, really, I, again, like I, I just don't think it's appreciated enough, and I think the supply aspect is something that we haven't talked about at all this podcast, but like that is, it's um, it's one of those things that's very hard to quantify, but when you look at other alts, you look at other assets, you look at their emissions, um, and then you look at hype, and it's just like, holy [ __ ].\nYeah, this is, I want that to be known.\nNo, that's a good point.\nThis is something, um, I'll also touch upon, and then we can end it.\nUm, this is from my friendies over at ASX, and they have this dashboard, and over the past 30 days, they've bought back, oh, the assistance fund has bought back nearly 2 mil hype, which uh, is apparently $55 million US.\nUm, Max, do you have handy your little calculator for circulating supply?\nDo you know what it is?\nIt's roughly 33% right now.\nYeah.\nI mean, so hype burn.f fun uh, is like the main calculator I use.\nUm, I don't know if you want to throw that up on on the screen.\nHype burn.\nVery, very fun website.\nYeah, I sent the link as well.\nIt's a great dash.\nAnd then it's under the Yeah, it's under the stats uh, tab up up top.\nFeel free to hover over the bottom part of the pie chart when you when when you would like some entertainment for a second.\nWait, what, what are points at now?\nI haven't even looked.\nWhat, what is the $180 per point now?\n800 is going to be true.\nBut yeah, I mean, I just, I want to echo again, like, we're in an, we're in a space where everybody is is fighting for, you know, alt assets that aren't Bitcoin, that everybody is arguing over, you know, the supply, what's coming online, what's not.\nAnd like you have an asset in hype that not only buys back a [ __ ] ton of the supply, not only has the perve growth, not only has the spot growth, and like a bunch of catalysts for future spot growth, but at the same time, like it's one of the only alt assets where you understand the supply, and you understand what is coming, and like that, I think is entire, is still like largely underrated by the market.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nThis is, this is a good website.\nI didn't know this existed, to be honest.\nI've just been doing calculations on.\nFor people are going to visit the site, and like they, they should really factor in like two main things, like when you go to the bar chart, like take a look at the remaining supply.\nObviously, uh, the team has taken a relatively generous amount, like 24% of supply, and like the remaining supply goes to community.\nIt's literally team, cuz obviously they deserve uh, a slice, a more, you know, generous slice in something that they've literally built for years now.\nUm, for those that weren't aware of how long Hyperliquid's been in development for, um, and then 42% because it was 38 before, and now because of 4% of total supply being unclaimed at Genesis, there's now 42% of the remaining hype supply to be distributed, which is well over $10 billion today.\nUm, and this could be distributed in who knows how, right?\nLike it could be, it could be like a re ridiculous, like, um, BNB burn style.\nWho the hell knows?\nI mean, is that efficient?\nProbably not.\nBut, um, it still technically would fall into going under the the community allocation, I guess you could say, if it just didn't, didn't ever exist.\nUm, and then ready for sale supply, which is something that was on that last chart that you showed as well, Boach, is very interesting, and and Max brings up a great point, too, with regards to hype being used across many different applications.\nOf course, Kinetic being one of them, but several others.\nMoney markets like Felix, Hyperlend, Hyperdrive, um, AMMs like Curve, Laminar, and several others.\nI mean, like, there's just so many ways that hype hasn't even yet been put to work.\nThe Hyper EVM amount of hype essentially with only 1.6 billion in TVO is just infinitismal compared to, you know, the TVL on some other chains, for example, right?\nBecause other chains factor in the total amount of uh, that token that sits on the chain because there's no split between the network so to speak on different quote unquote accounts, but Hyperliquid TVL is well over 10 billion today, 4 billion in cash, which is like just as much as almost anywhere besides Ethereum, uh, and again, USDC and like starting to pick up with tether and whatnot, but then you have tens of billions of dollars on hype there, which is not factored in because it's either staked or uh, some of it, very small percentage of it sits on HyperEVM, and a lot of it just sits in wallets actually, like, that's the ready for sale supply.\nIt's literally just sitting in wallets, not staked.\n194 million highs, 90, almost 20% of the total Hyperliquid supply.\nI mean, it's pretty ridiculous.\nSo, putting this to work is going to be very, very exciting.\nUh, and just overall something that is going to continue to again prove what Max just said very, very correct, which is throwing on this crazy speculative and monetary premium, the hype as it gets used in so many different ways.\nI think, I think no matter what valuation metric you ascribe to or how you want to value hype, it's pretty much all bullish.\nSo if you want to use comps, it's bullish.\nIf you want to use supply demand dynamics, it's bullish.\nIf you want to use a fundamental uh, feebased model, like it's, it's bullish.\nUm, and so like any way you slice it, like there's just, it's just kind of a an undervalued asset.\nSo yeah, bullish.\nI, that's a good note to end it on.\nUm, I am going [Music] to take this all into account.\nBuy more.\nYeah, perfect.\nI, I, I can't afford it.\nI can't buy any more hype.\nI don't have any money.\nUm, I need to shell some stuff.\nFirst of all, Zerx research pers, man.\nZerx research pers.\nThat's not coming.\nDo not say that.\nUm, can't wait.\nCan't wait.\nCheck out Tolks and Puan.\nCheck out DeFi Monk.\nDo not check out Misari.\nUm, Kinetic hopefully at some point.\nUm, soon.\nGive.\nRight.\nMax, I know to chill with you, man, because you have a day job, and then you are also Jeff's right-hand man, apparently.\nWhat do you want to show?\nAn evangelist.\nIf he's listening.\nI'm not.\nNo.\nUh, I've been working on some stuff in Stealth.\nUm, and so hopefully I can share more next month about that.\nUm, very good.\nSo yeah, just my Twitter uh, account for now, and that's about it.\nWe'll include everything in the in the show notes.\nPotentially even Sunny's tweets, even though they're Misari branded.\nBut guys, this was fantastic.\nUm, thank you all for coming on and taking time to appreciate you having us.\nAppreciate it.\n[Music]\n",
