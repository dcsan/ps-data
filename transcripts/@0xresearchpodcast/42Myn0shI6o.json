  "cleanText": "All right, welcome, welcome back to another live 0xResearch. Um, happy to have everyone on today. We've got, I think, an exciting app, uh, just based on a lot of news coming out this week. Um, Dan Smith and YaKob Brasha Deans joining from Blockworks data, Blockworks research, but uh, we've got some folks from Phantom, Brandon, CEO and co-founder, and then Fei, uh, product lead, uh, for trading at Phantom. So, uh, excited to have you guys on, and uh, from the Blockworks crew, excited to have you guys on to uh, chat with these guys and talk about um, the big news, I guess, for Phantom, for Hyperliquid, for Perps. Um, a lot of stuff going on. But maybe just to to preface the conversation a little bit, obviously Phantom, you guys rolled out uh, Perps, a Perp product um, in the Phantom wallet, Phantom app, um, just this week and to a pretty positive response. It seems like there's some excitement there. Um, and I think this this kind of follows some other, like, we've seen uh, Axiom is maybe another big one where they've, you know, merged like Solana meme trading with uh, Hyperliquid Perps. Um, you guys have been another, another big name here to sort of go this route. Uh, how has it felt like this week? How's the response been? Like, have you seen a good amount of usage on the product so far just in these past few days?\n\nYeah, totally. Well, yeah, first of all, thanks for having us on, guys. Uh, yeah, definitely been a super exciting week for multiple reasons. Uh, obviously perp launch, but uh, at the same time, Bitcoin all-time highs, uh, you know, market uh, obviously responding very, very well to the launch. Um, so yeah, in general, perp launch has been great. We're still rolling it out. Um, that's something that we do pretty often when we when we uh, unveil a new product like this. Um, just kind of slow roll the launch, get some data to understand how it's being used and just making sure it's as safe as possible. Um, so yeah, right now we're still in the middle of rolling out, but uh, definitely seeing some pretty good results so far. I think close to $70 million in total volume, uh, mostly over the past 24 hours, uh, as we're kind of accelerating the ramp. Um, but yeah, um, Femi, anything you want to add?\n\nOh, no, no, that's all good. Um, it's been pretty exciting to to launch this feature. We've been working on it for a while, picking it up, and yeah, the community response has been awesome, and honestly, we didn't expect it. Like, you know, we're we're very, we're very, you know, precious about the features that we build, and, you know, we put a lot of time and effort into it, but the the community response for this particular launch has been insane. Um, so yeah, excited to see. Yeah, you can feel that uh, the the viewpoint you mentioned there being precious, taking your time. Uh, you can feel that come through on the UX. It's it's super clean. Uh, talk to us a bit about how you thought about what the design should look like, how the user experience should work. Uh, perpetrators are a fickle bunch. So I'm just curious to get your perspective of, you know, like, how you got inside of their heads and try to deliver a product that was really exciting for them.\n\nYeah. Uh, so fortunately at Phantom, like, we we have uh, a good user research arm. We have a lot of, you know, perp traders in the house and um, people are, you know, interested in the space. We wanted to come at it from the perspective of, like, how can we, you know, perp platforms have notoriously been a bit complex and a lot of toggles and a lot of things that you can do. How can we strip down, like, the interface to, like, the core essence and what what people actually want to get, which is, like, going long, going short, depositing funds into that um, into that platform. And yeah, we we definitely took uh, some some design, some serious design decisions on, like, how how we wanted things to go. Um, I, I guess what are you curious about? Like, are you curious about um, specific design decisions that we took or um, like, how we went about the process itself?\n\nUh, a little bit of both, but I think more so focused around, like, the actual design decisions, right? And uh, you know, Robin Hood recently had their um, uh, conference, uh, or sorry, their their unveil of their perp products coming to the US as well. And uh, even as they were going through their demo, they were very excited about, like, their slider features and how you apply leverage and what your stop stop-loss setting will look like. Um, so yeah, just kind of curious from your your perspective because uh, as someone who's lucky enough to have been on the initial roll out, it does uh, it's it's very smooth. So yeah, just curious how you kind of got to that end point.\n\nYeah. Um, that makes sense. So I guess from, like, a onboarding perspective, like, we wanted to make sure that it was, you know, very simple, like, you could go from um, like, just a dollar amount depositing assets into the platform. Uh, if you look at, you know, perp platforms of today, it's like there's a lot of, you know, bridging, you know, bridge my funds to this place, do that transfer. We kind of abstracted a lot of that stuff away to make it uh, much simpler. I think the other side of it that's very important is the education piece, like, you know, onboarding, um, understanding, um, getting guiding the user through the process of uh, this is what a purpose, this is how you long, this is what liquidation is, so that they have the best experience. And and the last piece of that as well is around risk management. So something that came on in in in research was that, you know, people have, you know, different varied levels of risk, and we kind of let people self-select into that, and with that, you know, am I someone who likes to take a lot of risk? Am I someone who likes to take medium risk or low risk? And with that, we kind of, like, set defaults around the leverage, you know, whether you know, there's going to be a stop loss or take profit. These these are the kinds of things that we wanted to focus on from, like, that onboarding education experience to to make sure that people um, we're having a good time. And then on the actual, like, interface itself, um, like, opening the order, closing the order, we wanted to make as few taps as possible. Uh, one thing that I guess people kind of ran into uh, with issues was, like, understanding take profit and stop losses and, like, you know, that risk management around the position, and we wanted to simplify the language. We called it auto close. Um, we feel like it's much more intuitive, um, and you know, people can just set their percentages and opt into that that risk management when they're open in that position. So th those are a few things that we we've done. Um, but yeah, happy to ask any more questions about that.\n\nYeah, maybe just to add a little bit more color um, and context to what Fei was saying. In general, we basically recognized a pretty big hole in the market for a really simple, retail-friendly, mobile-first perp experience. Uh, and like Femi was saying, like, Perps is typically, I think, the people's initial reaction when they hear Perps is advanced trading, candlestick charts, um, a lot of multipliers and percentages, and it it's pretty scary and and it's not that, you know, it's not that enticing. Um, but for folks who have tried perps, you realize that actually it's it's actually a lot simpler than options trading or any other types of during a lot simpler, a lot easier to understand, and therefore, I think, can actually be a really good fit for retail traders, um, especially folks who like to trade meme points and things like that. Um, so yeah, our goal with the project was really to kind of open up that part of the market um, and uh, actually bring some new folks in.\n\nYeah, makes sense. And I think that jives pretty well with the the mobile verse desktop uh, the uh, gap as well, right? Like, when if I'm on a desktop, I want, like, I want the candles. I want all the full experience. I want the advanced mode as much as possible. But when I'm on mobile, it's like, I I don't even know why this is, but, like, the the the the marginal click is the most painful thing in the world to me. Uh, so yeah, I totally agree with your view there.\n\nI guess I'll ask something. I'm interested. Um, you know, I think Phantom now, I mean, you guys have become one of the stronger brand names in crypto, I would say. you know, making a bet on, you know, Solana maybe a few years ago, kind of it worked out in your favor, and now you've expanded from there, you know, other ecosystems, other products, like, built in to other features, other products built into the product. Um, you know, perps being another one along those lines. And I and I feel like the simplicity and ease that you've been able to incorporate a lot of, like, bridging, swapping across chains, like, some of these things, I don't know, previous wallet generations or iterations have, like, really struggled to give the user a very clean and, like, smooth experience. Uh, and I think you guys have done a pretty good job of that. And one of the thesis that we have at Blockworks has been, like, this multi-product DeFi approach being something of a winner. Like, we see this within Solana especially, right? Like, the Jupiter team, like, they're acquiring all over the place. They're building all these products. You know, Camino getting into swap products alongside their lending markets. Um, obviously, this is, like, another addition for you guys getting into perps. Are there other things that are, like, kind of immediately top of mind that you're thinking about, you know, as, like, next steps for you?\n\nUm, yeah. I Oh, actually, Rand.\n\nUm, yeah. I mean, just thinking about it from a trading perspective, like, my remit or, like, I I feel like people should be able to trade, you know, any type of, you know, asset and speculate on any type of thing um, that's possible. And I think um, more and more so, you know, a lot of these things are being built on crypto crypto rails. Um, so in terms of, like, new things that are coming up, we've we've all seen the work around, you know, prediction markets that are are quite interesting.\nWe've seen new new foray into tokenization of, you know, traditional types of assets um, around real world assets, you know, tokenized stocks and you know, this type of stuff. Uh, lending is also interesting, but I guess we we kind of just take the approach of, like, it's it's very much a user-centric approach of, like, figuring out what what our users want and what our users are are looking for. And I guess from the trading perspective, Brandon can talk more about, like, I guess, the holistic view. Um, but from a trading perspective, yeah, we want people to be able to trade any asset um, and speculate on on any asset and you know, benefit from this interoperability\num, that you know, these crypto rails kind of provide.\n\nUh, but Brandon, curious if you have, like, a more general, wider uh, view.\n\nYeah. No, I mean, I think um, you know, in general, our mission is to accelerate the adoption of crypto by making it safe and easy to use, and so we really try to focus on that uh, like Femi said, user first, user-centric mindset and sort of usability um, focus on the usability aspects. Um, and so basically, yeah, we are as sort of the DeFi ecosystem is becoming more robust and the underlying infrastructure is becoming more and more sophisticated, our job is basically take all of the common verbs that people like to do and and kind of boil them down to their simplest and easiest form and safest form for for folks to to understand and use. So yeah, I think you you should expect more verbs to get incorporated as first class citizens in Phantom. But I'd say not because because um, crypto as a whole is is is absorbing all sorts of use cases, not just trading and speculation, but also payments, especially peer-review payments, uh, consumer to merchant payments, things like that. I think you should expect, you know, Phantom to incorporate all of those types of things as well over time.\n\nYeah, I love that. I think um, looking back at some of the pro, like, it seems like the strategy has maybe been somewhat different from other, you know, competitors in the marketplace where you guys seem to be um, more consistent about, like, integrating, you know, strong, you know, app partners, basically, to maybe build out some of these things, right? I think, you know, the bridging app, it's like you use multiple providers and routers there, um, partnering with maybe like OKX for some of the swapping um, back end, and then here in this case with perps, like, using Hyperliquid as the back end, maybe to start. I guess, can you guys speak to that a little bit? Is this just, like, it just makes more sense, you know, go after whoever's making the best product and and you know, combine that with you know, our our UI and make that great for the consumer, or how does that decision- making look here? Mhm. Well, I'd say it's it's very, I'd say pragmatic uh, decision- making in terms of um, you know, because we are the wallet and we we sit closest to the end user, we have a lot of freedom in what we can integrate and and aggregate. Um, and so oftentimes it's easiest to go uh, when we're we're kind of um, putting one of these new products out there, it's often easiest for us to pick one very strong partner in the beginning. Uh, prove out um, the feature, gather data, understand that this is something that likes people like to be used, sort of challenge our initial thesis, polish things up, and then it's uh, and then we can make a decision to invest more, aggregate other sources. So that's kind of something that we've didn't done with the swapper is um, you know, initially only integrated uh, Jupiter uh, aggregator, and then eventually, obviously, as the swapper has shown more and more usage, uh, and we want to deliver the best prices and liquidity to end users, um, add other types of aggregators, OKX, like you mentioned, um, DFlow and all these other guys, and that's actually that's honestly us harnessing the power of crypto as an open, permissionless ecosystem. There's all these teams trying all sorts of novel approaches and different areas. Um, and why why shouldn't we package that up and and give it to the user in in the best way possible? So that's kind of anyway, that's a little bit about I guess how how we how we may progress through these different types of features. Um, but yeah, obviously Hyperliquid um, has been tearing it up lately in the in the decentralized perp landscape, and there there really is no second best uh, in my mind compared to them um, at least in the in the onchain realm.\n\nI guess, like, on the topic of uh, distributing access to, like, perps and permissionless assets to the majority of users, I would like to ask something about uh, HIV3, which is going to be the permissionless perp market listing system. But maybe I can give, like, a quick overview to the guys from watching from Solana who might not understand exactly how Hyperliquid works. So at Blockworks, we kind of have a framework\n\n\nFor Hyperliquid, it has three pillars.\nThe first pillar is the hypercore order books that's created on the hypercore L1 that was created by the team, and this is where we see all the foundation listed markets using that, right?\nSo it's a highly performant order book model, but unlike a normal perps, this isn't the end state of Hyperliquid.\nThey want to be the infrastructure layer of perpetual markets, so they added two things on top of that, which we've seen recently with HP3 and builder codes.\nSo we kind of see the first layer on top of the hypercore order books as the coordination layer that distributes these markets via auctions.\nSo any deployer with one million hive stake requirement can list in a Dutch auction for their market, and they're going to get one slot where they can choose the asset, they can choose the oracle and margin requirements, and if they win that, they can list it, and they can add their own feed tier onto that, like taking max 50% of that.\nAnd then that's going to be around 280 markets listed once it's on mainnet.\nIt's once every 32 hours.\nAnd then kind of on top of that, we see, we feel like Hyperliquid does want to move to a more decentralized structure, and that also includes the front end.\nSo what they have, we see the consumer layer, and that's with builder code.\nSo any application, and this is what Phantom is doing, that routes trades through their front end can add their own builder code, which for that, they can take a maximum of 10 basis points per trade.\nI think Phantom is doing five.\nSo that's kind of how all of this is connected.\nSo I guess my question is, like, looking forward, when we see like HRP3 coming to mainnet and we see a huge amount of markets being listed, is that something that Phantom is going to allow to be integrated, or are you going to go more conservative and only list perps that are deployed by the foundation?\nWell, yeah, just to comment on HIPP3 and just tie it back to something I said earlier, I think HIPP3 is a perfect illustration of the power of open permissionless networks, right?\nA player like Coinbase or Robinhood perhaps is never going to be able to replicate that type of system, right?\nAnd that kind and harness that kind of community energy to bring these new markets.\nAnd that's basically exactly why they were unable to really capture, you know, the memecoin and launchpad meta of 2024 and 2025, and they're they're all sort of scrambling to do their own chains.\nBut yeah, in general, I think we, you know, we want to be able to provide as broad access to as many assets and markets as possible.\nIt's hard to say exactly what those markets like are going to be.\nSo I think there is probably going to be some amount of curation from our side in the beginning.\nBut I think in an ideal world, Phantom is sort of your browser to Hyperliquid, and you'll be able to access any of these things as they pop up.\nYeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.\nLike, and there's another aspect of that, the one million hype stake security requirement.\nAnd I think a lot of people were curious first why it's so high.\nIt seemed almost like a barrier to entry.\nBut I think the reason that that's high is very important because it allows front ends to trustlessly list these markets because you know that they're actually backed by this hype stick that can be slashed if the deployer decides to list any malicious markets.\nSo very interesting.\nYeah, pretty smart.\nSorry, Fei.\nAnd then also, yeah, I feel like it also sort of, yeah, inherently rate limits everything that's coming out and allows folks to kind of get a handle on it.\nBut yeah, go ahead.\nYeah, no one wants to be slashed, I guess, at today's price, $45 million worth of tokens.\nSo definitely aligns the incentives towards, you know, creating quantity assets that, you know, are have good oracles and and are in a good spot.\nBut yeah, I'm pretty bullish on HIPP.\nIt reminds me of, you know, the place that Uniswap and, you know, these other liquidity providers have where you can permission list people and individuals can permissionally list markets.\nI think just to add to Brandon's point, you know, that's something that, you know, other traditional players, you know, they haven't really been able to leverage or benefit from in this past few years.\nAnd then Phantom has been able to take advantage of.\nSo, I'm pretty excited about that.\nAnd then also just a shout out to the unit team, which I think are kind of also working on some interesting new types of markets powered by HIP3, which should be which would be interesting, and yeah, kind of just speaks to the point of broader access to, you know, more innovative type innovative types of assets, which is pretty exciting to us.\nI think maybe slightly, slightly separate from the line Jakob was going down, but in relation to the maybe Hyperliquid ecosystem, you know, you guys within Solana, for example, you know, you can stake soul with Phantom.\nYou can do things on chain.\nObviously, the HyperVM, it's a little bit of a fledgling ecosystem still, but it seems like they're they're making some efforts to kind of connect that base perps kind of exchange layer to their sort of broader DeFi ecosystem now, and we're they're seeing some growth there, and obviously the Hyperliquid community, the you know, the lovers of this token are very excited about that one.\nSo I don't know any thoughts, ideas there on, you know, there's no chain added yet to Phantom to natively interact on HyperVM, but with this ad, like, are there more synergies coming in the future potentially?\nYeah, I'd say, um, no concrete plans yet.\nIt's definitely something that we're looking at and evaluating.\nUm, you know, we're coming fresh off of the per hypercore, you know, direct integration, and there's still actually a lot left to be done there.\nUm, so that's going to be where our focus is.\nUh, I'd say broadly in terms of integrating new chains, it's something that we don't take lightly, and it's something that we, once we've committed to integrating a new chain, it's something that we go all in on.\nUm, and that's something that's a little bit of a different approach than other wallets and other products in general, where they try to just provide as much mass access to random EVMs as possible.\nBut um, we found, I found that as a user that really, you know, it's really acts to the detriment long term of like the usability of these of these things and also prevents prevents you from as a product to go all in and go deep on on ecosystems, right?\nLike one of our huge advantages with being Solana first was to really take advantage of all the cool new stuff happening on Solana, Solana Pay, Solana mobile, all those types of things.\nAnd so if we are going to get do a hyper EVM integration, it's something that you you would expect us to go all in once we do it, um, not really have like one foot in, so that's general thoughts about it.\nOne thing you mentioned earlier was around how, you know, historically the wallet has been this the user interface into the chain, right?\nSo people always talk about where in the stack the product you're building is, and the the wallet has largely sat directly at the top of that.\nOne trend that's fairly interesting we've seen recently is the idea of embedded embedded wallets, where the app kind of like serves as the wallet as well.\nI'm curious broadly what you think about that trend, and then when you look out going forward, how do you think wallets will shift into the future?\nUm, and like, you know, historically just been like this browser embed, but want to want to kind of get your take on on how the user interface for the actual wallet itself will shift going forward from here.\nMhm.\nUm, well, yeah, I think there's a couple interesting things going on with the embedded wallet trend.\nUm, one, I think one big drawback of the embedded wallet trend is that it it certainly makes it easier for folks to onboard that very initial first time when they're kind of hearing about crypto for the first time, hearing about a new app, they download it, they're able to onboard very quickly and get in, and that's great.\nBut once once they start to become a more advanced crypto user, they want to start exploring other chains, other apps, uh, other types of assets, it then becomes very difficult for them to actually move around um and and do that exploration unless they are kind of using a wallet that had provides broader access and access more of a home base.\nUm, and so yeah, I think in in the future you might see a wallet system that combines the best of both worlds.\nUm, but I do think that embedded wallets current in their current form kind of break down some of the open permissionless, you know, value props that we were talking about before and sort of the composability aspect of things.\nUm, so I think we have a long way to go to kind of see what what the final form of all that stuff is going to be.\nUm, but I do think that one sort of underpinning trend for all of this is sort of the rise of crypto on mobile specifically.\nUm, and what's underpinning that trend, honestly, is is the rise of Solana and faster and cheaper blockchain.\nSo once you got faster and cheaper, more predictable infrastructure that made it a lot easier for people to build apps on mobile, and then on mobile, obviously, we know from a decade of web 2 that people prefer to use native mobile experiences and not, you know, have to mess with the browser in the app.\nSo I think as you see crypto go more and more mobile, you will see experiences go more and more native as well.\nAnd I think you will see the wallets of the future adopt that and take a more native direct integration approach like we did with Perps.\nUm, Fei, I don't know if you have anything to add.\nOh, that was perfect.\nThat was excellent.\nBrandon, is the, uh, sorry, I should know this, but is the perps offering only available on mobile?\nIs that Yeah, it's actually only on mobile.\nOkay, very interesting.\nThat was intentional as well.\nUm, we we wanted to see if we could, you know, build like a compelling mobile experience.\nUh, and again, a big thing that we've understood from our users is that they value, you know, this kind of mobile convenience.\nYou're not always on the computer.\nYou're not always, you know, locked into that terminal.\nUm, most of the time you're somewhere else.\nSo being able to conveniently and you know, in a nice user friendly way, uh, go be able to go longer, go shorter, take actions on, you know, the market, um, is is a very powerful thing, and that's why I went for mobile first.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nIt's like once you click that perps button, it feels like you're just in a perps app, right?\nAnd versus and in contrast to that, right, you're in the mobile wallet on the web browser.\nUm, if I click the perps button, like I'm still in my web browser or in in the uh, the browser extension rather.\nUm, I I don't know if you can share any like rough numbers here, but I'm curious what percentage of your users are either like dual uh, dual use between the extension and mobile versus just like mobile first and like they don't even bother with the extension.\nUm, that's a good question.\nI don't I don't have the the overlap numbers off the top of my head, but I will say that mobile is definitely, well, I actually I'm not actually even sure if it's a majority of the usage, but it's definitely the fastest growing and um, you know, most active contingent of the user base for sure.\nI think that this is a great thing to highlight, and this is actually something that we've been um discussing quite a lot frequently is this it feels like we're at something of, well, maybe we've been at this transition point for a few years now, but um, a lot of the kind of older and and still many products today within crypto, it's like they're, you know, you build the the desktop friendly, you know, terminal style application, um, and that seems to resonate quite well with like the proumers of today, like the very heavy users, the guides doing, you know, a lot of volume in crypto terms, like, you know, on a trading application, for example.\nUm, but more and more, like as we get, you know, more users on boarded, it it seems like the speed and convenience of just like having the thing in your pocket and it being native, um, is turning into an advantage when it's done well.\nUm, but I I do I do find this interesting, like we see different teams take different strategies here, right?\nLike I'll just point out Axiom again because they have a similar perps integration, but they do not have a native mobile app, and I do find myself kind of cursing them a little bit of like, yeah, the desktop experience is great, but like I wish I could take this with me native on the go on mobile.\nUm, so I I think it's great that that you guys are are thinking along those lines as well.\nYeah, it's a it's it's a very hard thing to get both things right.\nUm, from many different aspects, not not just a product aspect, but also from technical, you know, aspect and all that.\nSo, it makes a lot of sense where small teams, fast and nimble, they choose one specific area where they're trying to play to win and then go really hard there.\nUm, but yeah, as the space gets more mature, I think you will see folks, especially the big dogs, go kind of try to go for multiple verticals.\nBut uh, interestingly, I think you've seen, like, for example, Robinhood, um, in in the TradFi world, go all the way all in on mobile first, very retail friendly, all the way to IPO, right?\nSo, it's it's uh, that's certainly, you know, I think we we just have to make sure we're not thinking too small as a as an industry because there's there's still a lot of people out there who have never even touched crypto in their lives.\nSo, yeah.\nAnd that's a great point because they've actually they've gone in the reverse direction lately, right?\nThey've been rolling out their their desktop product because they've been mobile mobile only for so long.\nTotally.\nYeah.\nSo, an interesting contra.\nAwesome.\nWell, uh, Dan, Shondaanda, if you guys have any other questions.\nIf not, I'll I'll give you guys the floor.\nOh, yeah.\nGo ahead.\nI guess I have one question.\nAnd again, I'm like, sorry if I'm going too deep, but I'm a Hyperliquid bull.\nI feel like I have to I have to ask this.\nAnd again, kind of just to contextualize with these three layers.\nWe see that I think Hyperliquid is really emphasizing a symbiotic relationship between themselves and everyone who integrates\n\n\nWith the platform, right?\nWe see it with the coordination layer, and we also see it with the consumer layer, the front ends with builder codes.\nUh, something I think is important to note is the fee structure of how Hyperliquid works.\nSo, they have fee tiers and fee tier discounts based on your Hyperliquid staking tier that goes up to like 40% discount.\nBut, uh, according to the docs, if you as a builder have a higher tier than the user who's trading with your code, the user pays their tier, but it gets executed at the builder fee tier, and they keep 100% of the up to 100% of the difference.\nSo, my question kind of is, is there a future where you go all in as you said and maybe get a high position to fully integrate into the ecosystem and to benefit from these uh economic choices?\nFem.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUm, we've we've definitely taken a look at this.\nUm, I I remember looking at the docs and seeing the the staking referral program, and I was like, you know, the eye the eyes lit up.\nUm, but, um, from my understanding, it's not uh on mainnet or it's not on um on test net or mainnet yet.\nThey've announced it, but hopefully it's coming soon.\nUm, I think we're we're we're in a position.\nIt I feel like, you know, being able to take a position on that and, you know, potentially uh reduce fees or, you know, have a a wider margin is is something that, you know, we could we could definitely consider.\nUh, but no action has been taken on that yet, and I think we're still kind of waiting for the Hyperliquid team uh to kind of, you know, figure out when when that staking referral program is going to be available.\nUh, but definitely exciting.\nI'm kind of very, it seems like the Hyperliquid team in general are, you know, thinking about the right things, thinking about incentives the right way.\nUm, so I I'm definitely bullish on on on the the various initiatives that they've had uh to make sure that, you know, builders um are are in a better spot.\nBut Brandon, yeah, any any extra thoughts on that?\nUm, yeah, like we said, it's still it's still pretty early in that, like the system is still much more theoretical.\nUm, but definitely something that we're keeping an eye on.\nAnd I'd say in general, it definitely fits our MO of like going very deep and hard on on an ecosystem to do something like that as well as something that's good for users.\nSo, um, you know, I think you should expect us to probably do something in that area.\nYeah.\nAnd just a general shout out for builder codes in in general because I think when we were evaluating all of the different types of, you know, uh, you know, perhaps venues and looking around, like I think only at the time that Hyperliquid had, you know, a specific system for being able to allow builders to to monetize or integrators to monetize, the other platforms at the time didn't didn't seem like they had that.\nAnd I think um only recently like Dydx now like announced native ability to kind of like capture these, you know, builder fees.\nUm, so the Hyperliquid team have definitely been thinking about, you know, this piece around the front ends and and how they play into the ecosystem uh much earlier than than other players, which was interesting to see.\nYeah, I mean it's incredible how much adoption they've got with such a small team, and so much of it comes down to these economic decisions and focusing value cruel to their token and aligning incentive for all three layers.\nUm, and also just to go back to the the thing about sync referral fees, there is also an option to make it to share the discount with the users.\nIt doesn't all have to go.\nI said the example that you take 100% of revenue, but up to 50% can be shared.\nSo that's also a very interesting angle there.\nAwesome.\nWell, uh, it was a pleasure to have you guys on talk about this this new roll out.\nI'll roll out the red carpet for you guys if you got any last words, last shout outs for Phantom, what you guys are doing.\nBut otherwise, appreciate you coming out today.\nYeah, thanks so much.\nUm, yeah, maybe just quick plug.\nUh, you know, obviously if anyone has not downloaded Phantom yet, please give it a try.\nphantom.com.\nUm, follow us on Twitter at Phantom.\nWe're also hiring really aggressively across pretty much every single role uh that a company in general has to offer, especially engineering, product, and and design.\nSo, if any folks uh, you know, uh, are looking uh to join the team, please DM me directly um or check out the jobs page on the website.\nUm, yeah, just and appreciate you guys having us on.\nAwesome.\nThanks for coming on, guys.\nAppreciate it.\nYeah.\nCheers talking to you both.\nThanks.\nTake it easy.\nThanks, guys.\nSee you on Twitter.\nSee you.\nBye.\nAll right, that was awesome.\nUm, yeah, Phantom's crushing it.\nReally appreciated the in in-depth uh Hyperliquid angle there, Shondaanda, as well.\nThat'd be really interesting.\nI mean, you really see the power of what the of the of the product Hyperliquid's put together.\nUm, from the perspective of a front end like Phantom, you know, you can hear how excited they are about that setup.\nVery interesting.\nAnd so, we talked we spoke with the Phantom guys.\nNow, we've got some Hyperliquid adjacent fellows out here.\nUh, Oxom Omnia at Kinetic and Max Fij.\nI would say I don't know institutional investor, maybe community member.\nUm, whatever term is.\nThanks for coming on, guys.\nNo doubt.\nThanks for having us.\nCult leader at Hyperliquid Community.\nThanks for having us, guys.\nAwesome.\nWell, we just uh we spoke to the Phantom guys a little bit about about the Hyperliquid integration.\nI guess now we can pull in some, you know, Hyperliquid adjacent folks to talk about either that integration or, you know, others that um we're thinking about or just generally like that ecosystem.\nAnd I know Shondaanda here has got his own thoughts um that maybe we can go into some more detailed conversation on.\nUm, but I guess I'd curious just to get your guys takeaways, like what do you think about, you know, Phantom rolling this product out?\nWhat do you guys think the future holds here for uh, you know, maybe additional Hyperliquid rollouts on other platforms?\nYeah, I think this is like the bull case that a lot of us have had for a long time.\nUm, and it just, you know, takes time uh for these things to actually come come to market.\nAnd I think what's, you know, most compelling to me is just that it is a, you know, cross ecosystem play, right?\nLike Phantom grew up on Solana, sees value here.\nUm, and I think um, you know, that's I think the the best validation you can get you can get um, and I think the scale, right, is just on a whole different level, right?\nLike I I would guess maybe, you know, we see 25, 30,000 DAUs on on Hyperliquid.\nI I forget.\nI think Artemis keeps track is where where I've been watching that, and Phantom is obvious on the scale of millions, right?\nSo, obviously the the per product is very slow in its roll out at the moment.\nI think last I s I was like 3,000 users have been onboarded via their uh referral code.\nBut I mean, this could just move Hyperliquid user metrics uh to a whole another scale in of itself, let alone other people, other platforms doing this, right?\nUm, so I'll definitely be keen to see how this plays out over the coming month, right?\nIs yeah, again, it's kind of unprecedented at the Phantom scale.\nIt's also EU only, right, if I remember correctly for now.\nIt's quite limited, yeah.\nI don't think every user sees it uh in app.\nI don't know if it's EU limited.\nUm, I have it on my mobile wallet.\nI they might just be doing like a controlled okay roll out to kind of stress test it, but it doesn't seem like they're limiting like particular maybe outside of the UK because they I saw in their tweets they say not intended for UK uh residents, but\nOkay.\nOkay.\nThat doesn't seem like\nYeah.\nUm, which is interesting actually.\nUm, because you at least natively, I think when you go to Hyperliquid, they they do have geographic restriction, right, on that site, unless they've changed that recently, but I know that like Axiom as well, their integration, they I don't think they do any um, like limited geoblocking, unless, you know, maybe I haven't tried a VPN in all 195 territories, but many if not the vast majority of the builder code apps do not go block because I mean, maybe this is the reason for it, but most of them are mobile, like on Telegram and whatnot.\nUm, so yeah, I mean, I would expect like it's totally expected that Phantom would rule it out that way, and then, you know, I would expect others that are of a larger scale to definitely geoblock, but the point being that yeah, most don't right now because they're based on things like Telegram and whatnot.\nThat's kind of an interesting.\nI mean, I'm sure this is not intentional, but that's an interesting angle there that Hyperliquid itself will geoblock and they're like, all right, if you're plugging into builder codes, like make your own decisions.\nYeah.\nWell, it's just a UI, right?\nI mean, at the end of the day, it's you can't geoblock the chain, right?\nYeah, I mean, you could, I guess, but uh, good luck, I suppose.\nUm, but anyway, you know, point being that yeah, like the hl.xyz XYZ UI is, you know, just a mere front end compared to what's actually happening on the background.\nAnd I think I'm this this stat I have not personally confirmed, but I think there's over 100 teams today that are using or integrating builder codes actively.\nAnd I'm sure many under the hood, not factoring in like, you know, of course, HIPP3 stuff to happen.\nUm, which would be awesome if builder codes rolled over into that.\nUm, but anyway, yeah, I mean, just pegging backing off of uh Max.\nThis is super crazy to see play out with Phantom.\nWas listening to them before this.\nSo, you know, shout out to those guys if they're listening.\nUh, very exciting.\nAnd, uh, yeah.\nYeah, just big applause for them.\nYeah, just to round out a point there as well.\nI just got confirmation that's not just EU, and they're rolling it out to certain countries just depending on uh, individual regulations as well.\nVery bull.\nVery nice.\nAnd I mean, more generally, I do think like the end state of Hyperliquid is to move away from the Hyperliquid front end, which is maintained by the foundation, and move to like a really permissionless system.\nAnd I think, for example, you'll see front ends that with HIPP3 can actually list all these markets immediately rather than Hyperliquid front end, which is going to be limited at first, obviously, due to like there's some regulation that plays into it.\nFor example, if unit lists uh equities, I'm not sure that you can just list that on the front end.\nBut if you incentivize builders to create hundreds of different front ends that users can access, then that's how you get these permissionless systems that everyone can get exposure to.\nYeah.\nHow I guess how are we feeling about the potential for, you know, like the onchain equity thing has been a bit of a narrative here, and that coming to Hyperliquid seems like an interesting angle, like some of the crypto, you know, tradi crypto companies are going about it in their own way, like kind of in the reverse direction, um, but, you know, X stocks, like they've got some some some tickers on Solana, for example.\nI don't know, what are you guys thinking there?\nIt it seems to me like it's potentially meaningful, at least from the perspective that it seems like a lot of people who are maybe trading on this app today, like there's a little bit of a regulatory arbitrage there.\nSo then to also be able to trade, you know, equities that maybe maybe there's a large user base here that that doesn't have access to those things with, you know, with size or with like a meaningful level of like safety or comfort putting, you know, assets on an exchange that aren't like within the US, for example.\nUm, what what are your guys thoughts there?\nIs that something that could really expand from here?\nI don't think I'd be the first to jump to uh be the one bringing that to market.\nIt's obviously a thorny topic.\nI think that the one point I would make is just um, you know, like Hyperliquid has succeeded at things that have, you know, failed in other contexts, right?\nLike we saw the the pump fund pre-list market yesterday and great point, right?\nLike the open interest got what up to 100 mil or or maybe it was the volume that got up to 100 mil, but you know, just like a whole different scale than what we've seen on other platforms pre-listings, for example.\noi at 100 mil, it did like 12 bill.\nUh, now I got to check this, but I think it the last 12 hours it did like a few billion in volume.\nIt's crazy, and to your point, you know, we've seen a lot of teams try this and get nowhere close, right?\nAnd so I think when we talk about onchain equities, at least what I think is is compelling in this context text if is if you're able to roll out both equity per onchain equities.\nI I do think, you know, just the kind of user activity around Perps, right?\nLike can actually draw demand forward for tokenized equities that in a vacuum may not have been there, right?\nLike everyone is like longing the Tesla per, right?\nThen now more sophisticated, you know, market participant can sort the Tesla per, hold the tokenized Tesla all in the same platform on the same block space, right?\nOpen up that delta neutral trade, and now you're introducing, I think, a lot more liquidity than what prior attempts um, you know, have been able to achieve.\nUm, and I think that's what makes the Hyperliquid angle here unique, right?\nUm, it's not just, hey, we threw some, you know, offshore debt instruments and an AMM and call it a day.\nI I I do think like we could see demand here at a level that we haven't previously seen.\nAnd there's definitely convenience, right?\nI I don't have to move to my balance from Hyperliquid to interact with brokers, right, to to pun on some of these assets now, which which is very compelling.\nUm, but like I said, you know, I it's a probably a big opportunity, but it's a big thorny airy opportunity.\nSo, you know, someone's going to take that risk, and someone's going to figure it out.\nUm, and it ultimately like tokenized equities do sound like the end state of a lot of this, right?\nBut, um, you know, I I don't know if we have the breakout moment this year necessarily.\nFrom the builder POV, I think, uh, just acknowledging the quality that's already been rounded up with regards to ambitions to build on HAP3 has already\n\n\nBeen really insane. The amount of, maybe not starting with pre, but more like the amount of ideas that have already been floated around with regards to types of markets that we could see, types of exchanges that we could see built around things like prepo trading, which has been really interesting, prediction markets free of oracles. Obviously, you know, the lower hanging fruit, which, you know, doesn't fairly account for the risk associated with this, but obviously the one that everybody's most excited for initially is, you know, stock per, right? Commodities to follow, maybe even FX rates, bonds, etc. Like you could really do anything, right? I think what's pretty underappreciated is the fact that, and I think, you know, understandably, because as is common with Hyperliquid and its announcements, it's usually a very, very straightforward, very literal announcement without a lot of context behind it. So it takes the community, you know, several cult leaders within the community to really break it down in digestible forms and ways that can be applied into several ideas. Giving an example here is it's not very clear that using HIPP3 and like getting the 1 million hype actually creates your own exchange that you can then set a singular collateral type for the entire exchange, which then becomes the base pair asset for everything you list. Right? So nothing even stops several teams or an individual team by itself launching several exchanges for 1 million hype each and then subsequently paying for each pair in hype as well. So I think a few components of HB3 are very misunderstood, not in a bad way, but just from a, I guess you could say, scale and monetary requirement way. And then on top of it, just a general, I guess you could say, skill issue where, you know, the soundness of a team with regards to market operations needs to be at a level that is, let's just say, you know, builder codes are a lot easier to start integrating than running an exchange on Hyperliquid via HIPP3, right? Builder codes is literally as it sounds like, a few lines of code, whereas HIPP3, you know, you'll need to handle everything from like market settlement to oracle selection, if at all, obviously, you know, market curation. So yeah, it's going to be very exciting. But the point being that, yeah, going back to a point you guys mentioned, I mean, the scale of the product that Hyperliquid has built here is, you know, we're very much at the tip of the iceberg still, right? With regards to what the application actually looks like, and starting to see that is very cool. And just, you know, obviously you can model out what it starts to look like, but it goes back to huge dub here for Phantom. Staking referral tiers obviously being something really cool as well. There's some exciting things that you could do around like stake optimization for things like HIPP3. Even stuff like, you know, gathering several, I don't know, open market type, you know, stakers to basically go and select and back a builder code or a builder deployed exchange through HIPP3 could be something really crazy too. I mean, who wouldn't want to throw some hype in to back a Phantom exchange, right? For example. So yeah, just throwing things in there in terms of just think ways to start thinking about the application of these various products on the builder co side, HP3, etc.\nYeah, super compelling. Just to backtrack to one stat I was completely off on. I was looking at volume in units of pump. So yeah, you're right, Max. It's about 100 million in 24-hour volume and 100 million as well in open interest, which is still a monster launch relative to a lot of the, I mean, also this has been a very anticipated token launch, but I think it's the combination of the two, the Hyperliquid product plus this monster token launch that gets exciting.\nYeah, I've been, and maybe some thoughts here, but I've been surprised at like the spreads on this like pump pre-market. You know, I expected this thing to be maybe be a little bit more illiquid, but there's actually a ton of demand for this. And maybe part of that is due to like the limitations of who can and cannot get into this actual pump sale. But, like you mentioned, like we've pre-markets for tokens have never been this large. And yeah, you're right, Dan. Like, this is, I mean, it's probably like the one token to have ever had for a pre-market to achieve a size like this. But either way, like even with relatively larger sized in the hundreds of millions, if not low billions, like of FTV for tokens in the past, like the pre-markets, you know, struggle to do hundreds of thousands, if not maybe a few million before going live in like volume. So it's interesting to see how jumped on this opportunity is.\nYeah. I think it goes to show like there's cross-pollination, you know, across all these order books, right? Like you you bring retail flow in. I mean, I think the timing of the Phantom integration was perfect, right? Like the Phantom integration rolled out and now you had a pump fund pre-launch market, and presumably, you know, that's all Phantom users were really familiar with at that point in time, right? And you know, in speaking with like the market makers that have, you know, deployed on Hyperliquid, I mean, that really is their northstar, right? Like if there is flow, they will deploy, right? Like you don't have to pay them, right? Like it pays for itself basically. And so it's I think it's compelling to see, right? Like people come for these like hot, flashy, you know, moment in time markets, and then they stay, and that, you know, I think just builds up a larger and larger critical mass of liquidity. As a result, I think a lot of people were surprised by the quality of Hyperliquid liquidity first and foremost, but also the level of sophistication in terms of, you know, the market makers that actually are prominently on Hyperliquid and how sticky it's been with those guys, right? T like, I know it was a shock to me, so I speak from personal experience, but also just generally through conversations. I think people are very, very taken aback typically because it's not what they would expect in like the first 10 times thinking about something like this. So yeah, just adding that on as additional context as well. It's, you know, there are very, very sophisticated liquidity providers on Hyperliquid, and again, I think the point at accent right here that Max made is like they are not paid whatsoever. They literally just, you know, get this pristine flow essentially. So that has been really cool. And again, like the the crossover is Phantom and their users benefit from it, right? Like you're not trading on some illiquid VAM. You're trading on an insanely stacked order book essentially. An analogy I recently made was, uh, I can't, you know, you guys are the gigab brains, right? So like very curious to see like if there's a another business on planet earth that's that offers something similar to Hyperliquid. With regards to the builder code component, it literally is, uh, you know, the most literal way of explaining what it is as an offering is Hyperliquid handing the entire world a $4 billion, you know, kind of active platform from a cash perspective that's there and, you know, verifiable, can be tracked, and then saying, hey, you can use this, make up to 10 basis points notional on a per trade, and 100 basis points on spot trade, and we're not going to charge you anything for it. We're just taking our general fees, which your users will pay, and then this is what you can add on top. I think any business today that is not saying yes to that offering is going to end up on the wrong side of history, that maybe that's a conservative way of putting it, but the point being that, uh, yeah, like that is that is the offering of builder codes in a box. And again, that's it's kind of crazy to to see like how this overlap between like the quality market makers that have showed up to Hyperliquid, you know, enabled a product like this to be so successful, and there's a crazy flywheel enabled by that. The more platforms that integrate Hyperliquid through builder codes, the more flow exists, the more liquidity will arrive, etcetera, etcetera. So anyway, just not to continue draining the conversation that way, but just another analogy um that I think is is pretty valuable with regards to how to best think of it from a mental model perspective.\nYeah. No, I think it's a great point. I don't know if anyone has a better builder code dashboard, but the guys at SuperX have something here, but I think something known to people maybe within the ecosystem is like PVP trade, Axiom, like these are some big ones. And they've done tens of billions in in traded volume on hype and have earned upwards like for PVP specifically a few million in fees off of that, and Axiom is approaching that $1 million mark, and they've only been in business for a few months now, which is is pretty impressive to see, I think, for them. The interesting part here is it's like, like you mentioned, you know, it's a pretty small lift to get this integrated, relatively speaking, and for you know, like these trading apps, when you look at Axiom or other trading bots, for example, you know, they're very focused on this like onchain memecoin game, they're making a ton of money, you know, they're taking, you know, 70, 80 bits net maybe from users trading those things, and it it's pretty interesting to be able to just like toss a Hyperliquid, you know, per kind of integration ation onto that platform alongside it and and basically utilize their distribution for some additional fee flow, and it's and make a better product for their users. It makes a lot of sense. It makes a ton of sense. I I can see why a lot of these teams like more recently Axiom and now Phantom have have gone this route.\nYeah, I think we'll we'll see, you know, more of our adoption to it just as these hit three markets eventually get deployed on mainnet in the coming months is my expectation, right? Because they will not be hosted on hl.xyz. So, you know, everyone who wants to, you know, have the fun of of running their own perk market also has to figure out their own distribution. And I think you know teams like Phantom will will be critical in in surfacing those markets.\nMax and I think quite some time how tier 2 and tier three exchanges will likely start to leverage builder codes as well because again, it is a free $4 billion of liquidity that you can just pass off for your users and and tack that fee on top. So that will, you know, that will be the day to say the least.\nI think going back to the builder codes really quickly, if you look at Axiom, I think we saw they did like 877K in volume. Their builder fee is actually really low. It's like one basis point. So if you do some napkin math, that means they've done around $8.7 billion of volume, which I mean that is significant even compared to Jupiter Per. And I think with Phantom, even in the near term, you're going to see Phantom and Axiom do more volume than Jupiter Per. And it's kind of going to become this chain agnostic thing that anyone can plug into, whether you're a centralized exchange, whether you're L1, you're going to access Hyperliquid liquidity. And I mean, like even if we go back to what we were discussing earlier about tokenizing equities, one thing that we were concerned about was what's the value of a listing if you don't have the mode of Hyperliquid, because it won't be hosted on their front end, but I I think the more these builder code applications are getting adopted and the more volume that flows through them, the less that matters. Like for example, we just talked to the Phantom team and they did seem pretty optimistic about unit and tokenized equities. So if you can bring tokenized equities to those like 15 million monthly active users on Phantom, that's very significant. And then not being listed on the Hyperliquid front end, it almost doesn't matter anymore.\nYeah, that's right.\nI'm just going to add to what you said on the Axium point. I I actually wrote a report covering them two months back in May, and at that time they had only, it was like basically half of the fees had ear had been earned at that same, you know, one, you know, 01% fee rate. So they had already done about, you know, 4 billion in volume at that time. So, in the past two months, they've been clipping along at like two billion in volume a month being traded through there, which is that's pretty impressive.\nYou made a good point on the moat that is the Hyperliquid UI. Yes. But I would argue the liquidity is more of a mode. It's something that we get asked about a lot with regards to just this general mental model. It's like, oh, like without the hyper liquidity, what's the incentive? Well, the incentive is, I think, pretty clear. Obviously, it's very costly, but the point being that you could leverage this insanely performant orderbook infrastructure and just general onchain architecture to launch your own exchange if you have the chops, right? Um, it is obviously a huge lift, but the point being that what we've even gotten wind of is teams working on this kind of, I guess you could say, not HLP, but like maybe a modified version of like HIPP2 as a service, really. Some teams have even thought about internalizing this actually and like making some of the markets themselves at least minimally, and market makers are definitely foaming at the mouth for this because it's just again, extra flow, different markets, oracle providers are jumping on this really bigly as well. So I mean, just an absolutely insane ecosystem unfolding right before our eyes here.\nI mean, it's going to be interesting the different ways different users leverage HIPP3, right? So I mean, some people are just going to build their own decks, but I can also imagine, as you said, like market makers, instead of providing liquidity on Binance, Coinbase, what they're going to do is they're going to work with projects teams, they're going to get the 1 million stake requirement, and they're going to do this like kind of Hyperliquid listing as a service where they create the market on behalf for project tokens.\nYeah, the Phantom guys, you know, they they've not committed to anything yet, but something that we talked about the other day was around this concept of like you you could see a concerted product roll out to similar to the other like chains, for example, that they support as a wallet. Like if you enable like native inwallet staking of hype, for example, that you know, they could build up a stack of that and then utilize it for maybe some of these other purposes that that kind of are integrated into this either HIPP3 approach or like the other point about\n\n\nCapturing that, like, fee delta, um, in the case of the builder code kind of margin that you'd get over, you know, having your users trade on there, um, which I do think is interesting.\nYeah, I mean, we've never really seen like an L1 token that has that level of uh, impact on a user's experience on the network, right?\nIf they stake it, like, you're not getting cheaper gas fees on ETH just by holding stake, right?\nLike, um, so it'll be interesting to see, you know, how that kind of formalizes over the coming months in particular.\nUm, you know, I, I work with Hyperliquid, which is the Hype Treasury Co. that's listed on NASDAQ.\nAnd there's definitely been a lot of inbound interest on, you know, how can the hype the company owns be used for like bilateral agreements with, you know, firms that want trading fee discounts or projects that want to do HIPP 3 markets, right, which require 1 million hype bond.\nSo, um, I think it just, every, like, this constellation, right, of, of liquidity and utility across the network.\nUm, yeah, I don't think we've seen the, the even almost the start of it, right?\nLike, I think Phantom was like the shocker around the world, uh, in, in that regard.\nDo you see, uh, like Hyperliquid and maybe others like specifically going in that direction?\nLike, they, they're excited to potentially, like, you know, list an exchange basically through Hyperliquid via this kind of method of acquiring the asset as a, as a treasury asset and then making use of it on chain?\nYeah, we're definitely getting inbound on that front.\nUm, and it, it's, it's interesting, right?\nBecause it gives you essentially uncorrelated income somewhat on the underlying hype, right?\nLike, it doesn't really matter if hype is worth a little or a lot, right?\nLike, if you're, um, providing that bond, um, and you're doing like a fee revenue share, for example, right?\nLike, it, it just, I think, introduces a level of, like, non-correlation that we just typically don't see with these types of assets.\nUm, you know, of course, I think in a future where there is a lot of demand for hip 3 markets, hype is probably doing well.\nSo, you know, there's a bit of correlation, but this is obviously a league ahead of, like, you know, we stake it and we get 10%.\nIn, in the, in the underlying, right?\nLike, that's, this is, this is quite a bit more sophisticated, and I think it'll, it'll attract the interest, um, even if, uh, you know, traditional, you know, legacy market participants as well.\nWhat are you guys' thoughts?\nI know it got mentioned earlier, like, Jupiter Perps versus, you know, now, if, if Phantom and and others, like, you know, Axiom that are kind of like native to the Solana ecosystem are integrating with Hyperliquid, like, what do we feel about their forward prospects, and maybe if there's already been something of a shift in the past few months?\nI have not kept track of the, of the Jup's activity in a while.\nYeah, I mean, I do think Hyperliquid OI as a share of, you know, Perps market share is has been up and to the right.\nUm, you know, I, I would just say, like, Hyperliquid came to the market with ultimately lower fees, smaller spreads, and liquidity is only going to be get more liquidity, right?\nLike, this just becomes a black hole at a certain point, if it hasn't already.\nUm, and so I think, you know, for other platforms to have a material shot at competing, like, you know, odds are your slippage isn't going to be lower.\nSo you probably have to start with the fees you charge, and you know, historically, Jupiter has been quite a ways higher.\nEven, you know, going through the Phantom interface, where they charge you, you know, the builder codes on top of the Hyperliquid fees, I think you're still coming out ahead of Jupiter.\nUm, and so ultimately, right, like, I think in the Solana case in particular, right, users interface with Solana through Phantom.\nLike, when I go on Instagram reels and I see, you know, meme coins taking, you know, center stage and in kind of a pop culture, it's always download Phantom, send Solana to it, and then buy something, right?\nAnd so as long as distribution is controlled by, you know, wallets, entities like Phantom, right?\nLike, I think they will be able to king make protocols on the back end.\nUm, and you got to be competitive if you want that distribution.\nUh, the other part is asset selection.\nUh, Hyperliquid has over 100 perps markets.\nJupiter remains with only three.\nUm, also, I mean, maybe I'm not sure how valid this would be, but maybe just my personal take on it as like a ju, just from the trader POV, is, uh, the wrapped Bitcoin version of, uh, you know, trading on Jupiter may or may not be the ideal, uh, way to trade, and like, you are also betting with Hyperliquid that they have a lot better, uh, way of, like, or, or more reliable way to price, uh, Bitcoin on their exchange, uh, like with the way that they weight each exchange that provides the oracle pricing for Hyperliquid, uh, or Hyperliquid's Bitcoin market to be specific.\nBut on top of that as well is a point that Max brought up earlier, which is now, thanks to unit, you could also run the, uh, funding rate arbitrage trade all on Hyperliquid.\nSo, um, I mean, imagine, like, users being able to run this directly from their Phantom wallet.\nLike, that's, that's a massive offering.\nI don't know if they offer it on spot, by the way, like, they, they don't, I'm not sure if they offer Hypot assets.\nI, I'm assuming the answer is no, but I wouldn't expect that to be far behind, essentially, especially if their Hyperliquid usage goes through the roof through, uh, builder codes.\nSo yeah, my own personal take, like, if I had, if I was just a regular user, would be like, choosing, uh, a platform based on asset selection.\nUh, if, uh, Phantom, the way I'm looking at it, too, is like, from a generally logical perspective, is like, if I'm Phantom and I want to have a robust perps offering, I'm not going to offer something that has three, three options for markets.\nI'm going to offer something that has, uh, you know, like, Mac said, like, there was actually a really cool correlation between Phantom supporting and then the pump, uh, pre-market.\nSo that was huge.\nUm, I mean, and like, that's probably kicked off a lot of their volume and usage already.\nSo yeah, that's, uh, that's what immediately comes to mind there with regards to that.\nI mean, we saw a lot of pretty aggro comments around, uh, Solana Perps is getting oneshotted.\nUm, you know, I, I think there is some validity to that.\nNot necessarily to them as a, like, from a business perspective as a whole, but just more so, like, it is pretty crazy signal indeed that Phantom, which is, you know, could say a Solana native, uh, choosing Hyperliquid, which, uh, yeah, that's, that's pretty huge ultimately.\nSo yeah, that's my, that's the extent of my thoughts on it.\nYeah, I mean, I have pretty similar thoughts.\nI think, like, when you're a perpetual exchange, you have two kind of architectural designs you can choose, right?\nYou can build on a general purpose, uh, L1, and then you get access to the existing user base.\nYou have this composability that it offers, or you take it off to your own L1, which is more performant because you can customize the parameters, but then you're kind of siloed from the existing user base, the liquidity, and you need to bridge onto the exchange if you want to do anything in DeFi, you need to bridge off, and I think that's the value proposition of Jupiter, of Drift, that anyone on Solana can easily access the platform, but like, strictly speaking in terms of execution, in terms of liquidity, Hyperliquid is better, and now with these, like, uh, builder codes being listed on Phantom, you're stripping away whatever edge Jupiter had because you have this composability directly, uh, on your Solana wallet as well, that you can just go long, uh, BTC, whatever of the 100 plus markets.\nSo yeah, pretty bearish, um, dexes and more, like, more generally, like, general purpose dexes on exchanges because that, um, composability has been taken away.\nThat's a, that's a good point, and like, something that we've come across as well is, this is pretty interesting.\nI think there's a lot of ego in this, like, preventing something like this from happening.\nBut, I don't think that a lot of perpetual exchanges or perpetual dexes today actually realize that they would probably make more money simply just integrating Hyperliquid.\nThis is like a pretty cold, hard fact at this point.\nUh, you know, just using builder codes.\nLike, if you as a perp dex, you know, and you guys do a lot of really good work on, like, uh, token emission data and stuff like that, right?\nSo, like, if you as a perplex and just in general as a business, right?\nLike, why would you spend, this goes back to the whole builder code capital efficiency thing.\nWhy would you spend, uh, money, whether in tokens or in cash, incentivizing liquidity instead of just literally taking what is right now, $4 billion in cash in stable coins on this exchange that you can integrate for free and just make money on top of?\nLike, it makes absolutely no sense to not use that, essentially.\nSo I, I don't know, I mean, I don't know what this is.\nI don't run a perps exchange, but I would assume that, uh, the conversations internally are just like, we could do this better, and it's very clear that that answer is very far, uh, from the actual truth.\nSo yeah, it's, you know, hopefully we start to see something like that.\nI think, uh, I think it's possible within the next few months, if not a year, that we start seeing, uh, perpex actually integrate Hyperliquid liquidity.\nThey're a lot better off becoming an aggregator than just like their own, uh, books, I think.\nAnd again, even if it's just for a bit to actually get, like, the, the, the primary argument today has been, oh, we have lower latency than Hyperliquid.\nOh, perfect.\nWell, that, that's fine.\nLike, you should at least give people the best possible experience they can, even if this involves using Hyperliquid liquidity to just bootstrap your own usage.\nAnd then people, you know, could find your UI or just general experience better.\nAnd, you know, all of a sudden now you're starting to solve that problem, uh, with regards to just the cold start issue, right?\nSo, I mean, that's probably how I would approach it if I was building a perpex.\nI would absolutely take Hyperliquid's 4 billion for free, uh, and just, you know, make money on top of that, right?\nBut that's probably not how the rest of them think, you know.\nYeah.\nYeah, I do think pulling up a dashboard from, uh, Lemi here, who's got a great Jupiter Perps, and he's got some other Jupiter dashboards, um, that go into detail, but, uh, we do see, like, a notable drop off in activity of the perps product since, like, January, February time frame, and it's been kind of trending down and flat since then, and we can see the AUM, the Jupiter Perps AUM basically flatlined and kind of peaked in mid-February.\nUm, which is interesting.\nI, I, I don't, the volumes that they had on here, you know, in the billions on a daily to weekly basis, like, don't support the idea that, like, all of it has gone to, like, Axiom, for example.\nBut it is interesting that time frame that, like, you know, Axiom and some of these other, like, builder code enabled products came to market, like, a few months back, and we've seen it, seen it stagnate since then.\nSo, um, it could be a little bit of, like, a loss of appetite and a loss of users to some of these other interfaces that, that maybe, uh, facilitate that volume and have, you know, more trading opportunities, like you mentioned, more markets.\nIt's not just, you know, three, four assets, um, like with Jup.\nSo I think that makes a ton of sense.\nThis is something that we've, um, honestly, I think I've, and I think we on the team have grappled with for a long time, is like, the success of the Jupiter product despite just having a few assets.\nAnd I think a lot of it, you know, has really come down to just like, you know, if you have a relatively, like, pretty liquid market enough for, like, those top assets, those top assets do drive, you know, a large majority of, of all the volume.\nUm, and so to an extent, it makes sense.\nAnd you could be right that just, like, offering up this quick and easy method to, you know, get to a better exchange from kind of within the Solana ecosystem still, um, really hurts them a lot.\nSo, we'll have to see if these guys punch back.\nLike, I'm curious to see if this is, like, within their visibility right now, and they're working on, because I mean, if anyone knows the Jeep team, like, these guys, they've been all over, like, acquisitions, like, buying out different things, like, countering with new products, like, they're a very competitive team for sure.\nSo, yeah.\nUm, two points there really quick is that, uh, obviously, Jupiter is more expensive by far as well, like, almost by 2x.\nSo, it just doesn't make sense to trade there, even if you think their liquidity is supreme.\nUh, on the other side of that equation as well is, uh, JLP, which is essentially this basket of assets, rather than, um, you know, it's not really comparable to something like HLP, which obviously is a closed source strategy, but clearly just, uh, strategically takes on trades, rather than just, like, access the, the, uh, you know, the base pair, uh, no matter what, like, the only liquidity, the only liquidity you can trade against on Jupiter to my understanding.\nSo that's something that's interesting.\nOne, one stat that several people in the community have been starting to to push really heavily, because, uh, when people think of Hyperliquid and then subsequently HLP, like, oh, well, HLP takes the other side of every trade, right?\nWhat happens if somebody opens a $1.3 billion James Winesque position, uh, you know, like, isn't HLP screwed?\nYou know, it's like three or four times the TVL.\nWell, HLP does, like, an extremely small percentage of the platform's, uh, total volume.\nI think, uh, and this was probably going to be inaccurate.\nThis is just the last time I saw.\nI think it was like the 15th largest trader by volume in the last 30 days.\nThat could be totally off, so don't quote me on that.\nBut the point being that it is, uh, negligible compared to some of the volume that the other players on the platform do, and then net across, you know, all of the other thousands of traders, the tens of thousands on a daily basis.\nUh, so just something noteworthy, I think, is the key differences between, like, what is the base liquidity on Jupiter plus the fee rate.\nI mean, so many different things combined here lead to, uh, I think Phantom ultimately choosing a very, very easy winner, and subsequently, like, the rest of these applications.\nSo yeah, it's, it's very, very, very different landscape.\nI think it's turning a lot of perps economic models on their heads in real time, which is pretty funny to see play out.\nCool.\nWell, I guess I want to bring up one last topic, uh, before we close things out for today, guys.\nUm,\n\n\nOne of the other really massive things on the timeline that we mentioned was the pump sale.\nAnd obviously, the pump there is the active pump premarket on Hyperliquid right now.\nI think, I don't know if anyone has it pulled up, but I think it's being priced at like $5.5 billion right now.\nAnd the ICO sale that's supposed to run this weekend is at a $4 billion valuation.\nSo people are currently paying a premium to get long pump before that sale and TGE, or you know, launch of the token.\nI guess I'm just curious to get anybody's thoughts.\nI think this is on everyone's mind right now.\nLike, are you buying the pump token?\nAre you not buying it?\nIs it going up?\nIs it going down?\nWant some candid thoughts?\nWhat do you guys think?\nHow are we feeling about it?\nI'll jump in.\nI think, you know, Pal's done something really respectable just from a sheer business growth perspective.\nObviously, can't say anything bad about that.\nI think it is going to end up as one of the better tokens that you can buy, especially if they're going to use a portion of it, even if it was like 5%.\nBut apparently, the rumor is what, 25% or something to buy back their own token, which is why I mentioned this thing on like Hyperliquid and its model affecting a lot of different economic models for several businesses across the space.\nNo matter what it is, it could be a money market all the way to something like pump.\nI'm not a buyer.\nI'm not a shorter, right?\nLike, I am just going to watch from the sidelines, and if it rips to something ridiculous, that would be really awesome.\nBut I think a lot of people on Hyperliquid, maybe that may be in the same position as me, would actually be happy to see that happen because Hyperliquid gets a ton of volume out of it.\nAnd once again, something really cool that's happened that I'm sure I can say because this was published on chain, of course, through buying the ticker for it, but Unit has bought up pump, which means that you'll be able to run the funding rate arbitrage trade directly on Hyperliquid with pump, which is going to be insane upon TGE.\nSo yeah, that's what I'm most excited for.\nI know this is probably going to be the most boring response, but the point being that I would literally just like to see Hyperliquid volume go burr.\nI think it is already, and it will probably continue to, especially with TGE coming around.\nSo yeah, that's that's my take, and obviously, you know, more power to Alon and Co if it does well, you know.\nSo yeah.\nWell, sorry.\nLast point, bring pump to HyperVM, right?\nLike, might as well do it.\nI mean, I think where the market is at, it's going to do well, right?\nLike, it's clear animal spirits are back, and so we can, you know, chop it up on whether rev share of X% is appropriate or whether the valuation is appropriate, like it, you know, is top three mind share for this cycle.\nAnd I think people are willing to buy that at, you know, relatively tame FTP.\nI think the question for me, you know, like the one thing I will say is like people, you know, I think I've been comparing revenue flows across different, you know, apps in crypto.\nAnd it's, I would say, you know, I currently see that revenue as being a bit weaker just in terms of where it's been trending.\nBut obviously, if you're able to raise a billion dollar war chest, then you have a lot of room to pivot and a lot of room to reinvent and, you know, get things going again.\nAnd especially with a fresh token, right, you have the ability to incentivize.\nSo, I do think it's a buy.\nAnd it just will be interesting to me to see, you know, if Pump makes similar decisions to as Phantom in terms of just navigating the industry going forward, right?\nAnd really, you know, going where users are, going where liquidity is, because I do think, you know, like that business model is definitely not dying anytime soon, right?\nLike our attention spans are not getting any longer.\nAnd it looks like, you know, like again, animal spirits are on the table.\nSo, I think you have to be bullish on it and hope for hopefully the best execution from the team going forward.\nI like pump at five billion FTV than I do Filecoin at 400 in 2021.\nYeah, I guess I have a pretty similar take in terms of how Pump is going to do.\nI think the premium kind of reflects the lack of accessibility for the ICO.\nLike a lot of people are restricted or don't want to KYC themselves.\nAnd I think it brings up another interesting point of like Hyperliquid becoming this pre-market platform that leads to price discovery for tokens because you can imagine if the premium goes even higher, they're going to be people that short the per once it's on Binance and long it on Hyperliquid, and that's kind of going to Hyperliquid is going to suggest what a fair market price is for new listings provided there's enough volume.\nSo I think that's going to be very interesting going forward.\nAwesome.\nI like a lot of these points.\nI think I'll share one last set of chart or one last chart, I guess, relevant to the conversation.\nThere was a mention around questioning their current revenues and and the maybe the quality of them or the stickiness of them.\nThe recent thing kind of in the news, or I guess that's that's been happening, is the bit of a shift from Pump Fund to Bonkfund, which is a Radium Launch Lab kind of branded Launchpad product.\nAnd so far, like, I mean, they've they've held on to this like flip of activity.\nA lot of the largest token creators have have sort of seem to swap over from Pump to Bonk Fun in the immediate term here.\nWhether that's just due to how the like token creator incentives work on one platform versus the other, or if it's, you know, a little bit of like outreach and and onboarding of some of those creators by the respective teams.\nBut yeah, I I think this is the one maybe one big question mark in the immediate term that kind of participants have to quarrel with is like, you know, a lot of their revenue might be at stake where, you know, for the past year and a half now, they've basically been unchallenged in this category.\nAnd I think this this has been the first like real threat.\nWe've seen, you know, believe kind of had like a few days of like very impressive activity that sort of stole the thunder from like pump for a few days, but this has been the first time we've seen like a a sustained stealing of the majority position of of Launchpad activity, especially on Solana.\nSo, that's a big question mark.\nAs to my thoughts, I I think I generally agree here.\nLike the demand from people who maybe can't access it or don't want to KYC, like like you mentioned, like I think that's a reason to see a premium on this on this pre-market per pump.\nIt makes sense to me.\nAnd I'll say, yeah, I mean, I think I'm I'm bullish at this price.\nThey I think they could be could have been a lot more, you know, aggressive or maybe greedy with the valuation, and they haven't.\nLike you mentioned, Filecoin at several hundred billion a few years ago.\nWe we've seen a lot greedier valuations.\nWas it 700?\nOh, no.\nOh, man.\nYeah.\nI don't I don't know the exact number, but we've seen some, you know what I mean?\nWe've seen some pretty strong and aggressive valuations.\nUm, even even just last year, right, you know, we had L2 tokens launching at, you know, $30 billion FTVs.\nSo, like to me, you know, this does not seem absurd.\nIt it it seems pretty reasonable.\nAnd full disclosure, I am long on the pump pre-market.\nSo, let's see what happens.\nJust put the feet in the assistance fund, though, bro.\nBut, uh, I guess it was glad to have you guys on.\nI was glad to have you guys on.\nUm, talking about Hyperliquid, I think.\nPretty exciting week for them, exciting week for Phantom.\nUm, and exciting week for Pump.\nInteresting that all of these like announcements, integrations, all kind of tying to Hyperliquid at the moment.\nUm, that's that's definitely good for the the fanboy community out there.\nI'm sure everyone who's long and strong hype is super excited right now.\nUm, I'm sure they're they're excited looking at their port numbers.\nUm, especially with with Bitcoin ripping higher, lots of assets are doing well right now.\nSo, all in all, a good week for the community.\nUm, but awesome.\nThanks for coming on, guys.\nAnd, uh, Max Omnia, if there's any last last words or shout outs you want to give, um, go for it.\nHyperlink.\nWell, thanks for having us, guys.\nUm, you know, uh, my Twitter is my my last name underscore first name for anyone who's interested, but otherwise, Omnia is the one with the, uh, active project next week.\nSoon soon.\nOkay, so unstaking go.\nYeah, coming soon.\nAnd thanks to uh, Shonda here for going deep on HIPP3 with the Phantom guys.\nUh they they didn't want to give too many specifics about their future plans, but we know, you know, I think Femi was pretty excited.\nHonestly, he seemed he seemed pretty pumped up about Hyperliquid.\nSo hopefully we see more from them coming soon.\nBut all right, we're going to close it out here.\nGreat stream, guys.\nThanks for coming on.\nLet's roll the tunes and we'll uh we'll roll out of here.\nAppreciate you guys.\nTake care.\nThanks, guys.\nHey, hey, hey.\n",
