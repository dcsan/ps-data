the one sec.\nCan you even do one second on MXC?\nOne minute.\nLet's see.\nI'm on the fiveday now.\nHold on.\nNo, they only have one minute.\nLet's go one minute.\nHold up.\nLet me get the deck screener out.\nWhat's Should we do an introduction or we just raw dog in the one second?\nUh, the one second would be crazy.\nHold on.\nI've got Kcoin as well.\nLet me see if I can get on the one minute, guys.\nUm, this one is actually a pretty special episode.\nWe're just going to watch Danny get Liquidated.\nNo, I'm safe here.\nAll right.\nSo, maybe just to open things up.\nPUMP trading live now on centralized exchanges.\nI think Ryan, you mentioned it's live on chain as well.\nTransferable trading on Jupit.\nI can't tell.\nYou can't tell.\nWe need to find out.\nUh we're just we're monitoring the situation currently.\nHyperlid is\nI'm on the one minute still at 55.\nSo above Okay.\nYeah.\nI mean relatively close here though I guess is what's interesting, right?\nThe hyperlquid market was at 6 billion or so over the past few days.\nUm, everything seems pretty much converged around this like mid 5 billion FTV kind of implied valuation right now across all these venues.\nI don't have like the Binance premarket open as well, but I think it's should be in a similar range.\nWhat do we think fellows?\nUh, big wicks incoming.\nIt's live on chin.\nI can transfer.\nCan you transfer me?\nHoly [ __ ] it's the go.\nDaniel Smith, active addresses with regard to PUMP.\nFun.\nLet's speak about this.\nUh, let's get Charles in here.\nLet me ping him.\nI will I will note that the hype market was up at six before these markets went live and has corrected downward to them in the mid five ballpark.\nAll right, there we go.\nI got the one second though.\nDo you?\nYeah.\nPull it up.\nI got to remove you, bud.\nPresent or invite.\nThere we go.\nOkay.\nBeing told it's live on chain and can transfer it.\nSo, trading should be open.\nThis one has I think I don't know if this one has the most tried to buy it.\nHuh?\nJust try to buy it.\nI don't have any money on Solana.\nI sold all my Solana for Hyperlquid.\nA DWF Labs address received 2.5 billion PUMP tokens.\nHoly [ __ ] They're going to scam it up.\nI wonder if the um the Cybel we found kept their tokens or not.\nI'm looking into that.\nYeah, check that account.\nThat'd be interesting.\nOr I guess guys, can I say something?\nThe one second is actually not very useful.\nSurprise.\nCan I say something?\nIt is not very works.\nI wish I could open all these charts in one chart.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nLike a trading view style.\nYeah.\nI want to see like all four of them next to each other.\nI got kind of snippy with with you.\nYanu.\nDo you think you'll get Where do I see?\nHere's the volume.\nWho's doing more volume?\nMXC's done four million in USD volume.\nKCoin's done three million in USD volume.\nDude, just pull up the hyperlquid chart.\nThese are all useless.\nThere's only one application to trade on cuz we at least get some price history, right?\nLike, yeah, it works.\nIt works.\nI have it here.\nYou want this?\nYeah.\nPerfect.\nI'm on the one minute.\nSee?\nSo, you can see here like at 12:58 before it went live, it was up at six and then corrected down towards the prices where the exchanges are trading at.\nI randomly spot checked like a couple of the early trades and it looks like it launched really close to six.\nInteresting.\nOkay, douche.\nSean is getting Liquidated like with very small size or what, Dan?\nUh, I mean, sorry, say that again.\nYou said you checked the early trades and it was at six.\nYeah, I mean they're like $100 trades.\nThat's Yeah, that's what I meant.\nLike no size basically.\nNo, I try to find the largest trade here.\nIt's a $1,300 trade, but like it's roughly that.\nI think people think I'm leveraged because Riley just messaged me asking me if I'm okay.\nUh, let me check that account though.\nThe 888F who I bought 500 wallets for $400 each for 200k in total.\nUh, which seems like a lot of effort to get the exact amount of tokens.\nIt doesn't.\nYeah, it still doesn't make sense unless they have some kind of or they're just gambling on a some kind of benefit for air drop.\nYeah, they did like a really poor job trying to hide it, but it's definitely possible.\nSometimes you don't really need to.\nYeah, it's funny because sometimes you get like um who was it?\nLike the layer zero team and they're like, \"We're going to search your houses and your mothers and your wives and your children's closets and look for all the civil addresses.\"\nAnd then you get other teams where it's like, \"Yeah, we put a weak geob block on the website.\nEnjoy.\"\nOh, here we go.\nYeah, this wallet's moving uh tokens.\nOh, wow.\nThe hype market is moving.\nWe're back up at six, gentlemen.\nVery good.\nWe What do we actually expect here?\nLike Ryan, I know we we meme around that when we say 12 bill by end of week, but can we can we speak freely?\nSerious.\nI think there's a meaningful probability that it closes the week above 10 billion and even today.\nIf it closes at above 10 billion today, you will be invited to my wedding.\nI didn't think that.\nI thought I was just going.\nSo, it's nice to know.\nThat's funny.\nBut I got to work for it.\n30 million liquidity on Salana is interesting.\nIt's the Cyber has aggregated all of its PUMP tokens into its single address and it's 200k participation is now worth about 260K.\nOkay.\nBut again, it could have just done this with a single address, but it's kind of funny.\nIt feels like that probably wasn't Well, no.\nI guess if they have all this infra set up, it's clearly got to be worth it for them, right?\nIt would have been fairly effortless.\nSo you have I mean you're spending gas to facilitate somewhere under so those 500 wallets they had to send soul send USDC deposit into the ICO and then send back.\nSo it's 2,000 transactions.\nI mean that's pretty negligible in terms of cost to run this and they already had the infrastructure set up.\nSo, right now, okay.\nWell, [ __ ] Riley is idiotic cuz now I break even.\nI'm going to bully him.\nIt's What?\nCan I see the order book on here?\nOh, I can.\nWhat?\nWhy is it not up above?\nIt's You need to be logged in.\nYou're not You're based in the US, so you can't actually I don't want to be logged in.\nJust show me the order book.\nIt's Should I just pull it up here?\nYeah, put I want the order book next to the chart.\nDo that for me because I He's treating me like [ __ ] gave him the podcast hot seat.\nNow he's treating me like I'm Who's Joe Rogan's guy?\nYou know who I'm talking about.\nYeah.\nHey Jamie.\nHey Jamie.\nPull it up.\nThere we go.\nWell, normally I use Axiom, but that's on my laptop, so I don't want to go do that.\nJamie lives a good life.\nIt's not a bad person to be.\nYeah, that's true, bro.\nHe's getting paid.\nLet's be real.\nWhat was Rogan's contract with Spotify?\nLike nine figures.\nHe's doing all right.\nWait, what is it on chain?\nBecause I think it might be 0.52.\nJuke, it's at 5'8 right now.\n58.\nI'm looking at KCoin.\nKCoin 59.\nMEXC 57.\nHyperlid is it's more expensive than everyone everywhere else right now.\nYou know what that is?\nThat's the leverage.\nEvery chart isn't like up and to the right right now, though.\nThey're all just up.\nNot a lot of liquidity on chain though.\nDog [ __ ]\nReally?\nIt's 30 million.\nDude, imagine the size Ryan Connor slinging if he says 30 million.\nNot enough for Ryan to get in.\nthe order books.\nHold on.\nLet's see what kind of size these guys have in the order books.\nWhy is the total?\nShow me it in dollar.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nWe should probably talk about something semi meaningful.\nAre you ready?\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nJust keep this just keep this.\nKeep it up though.\nI want to know what's happening when we do that.\nLike I get really distracted.\nJamie, keep it up.\nKeep it up, Jamie.\nWait, that's not the one minute chart, dude.\nOh my god.\nI want to see the candles, Boach.\nThere you go.\nThat's what we needed.\nSee, look at that.\nDude, I'm about to make Ryan Connor puke.\nAre you ready?\nWhat are you doing, Ryan?\nThoughts on this?\nIt's legit breaking out.\nYou have to admit that it is breaking out.\nDo you see?\nLook at this.\nBam.\nHoly [ __ ]\nIt made a little bit of a wedge and now it's breaking out.\nIs there like an AI like uh TA tool yet that will Well, there there's a million of them, but it doesn't The thing is AI will never be able to do this.\nYou can you can send chart pictures into like 03 and it'll tell you what it thinks.\nReally?\nThat's hilarious.\nYeah.\nYou just tell it to analyze the chart and like, you know, explain key levels and like, hey, should I long or short here?\nAnd it'll tell you what it thinks.\nInteresting.\nPhantom uh now has uh regional gates on their product on their wallet.\nI didn't know I don't know if that's new or if they've always had that since launch.\nI I'm not sure because I didn't You're right because I didn't try when they first released it.\nI saw I had the per option, but I didn't try to like add money to it.\nAnd when I tried the other day, I noticed that it was uh georestricted.\nSo, it may have been from the beginning.\nIs Jacob coming down or are we stuck with you?\nUh, you're stuck with me.\nDid you find out if that address is still holding all those addresses are still holding that Sibil amount?\nYeah, I just tweeted it out.\nUm, so you can get the you kind of have to click through the thread.\nLike I quote tweeted Jacob initially and then quote tweeted myself most recently, but here I'll ping you the address in the chat.\nDo you want to pull that up?\nOh yeah.\nCan you pull up my tweet?\nCan I?\nNo.\nNo.\nI literally sent the Oh, I just sent it.\nWhatever.\nI put that in the show.\nI want to pull this one up on screen.\nBox, show us how the Liquidation feature works.\n[ __ ] Z's bullying me as well.\nOh, he put the address in the YouTube chat.\nThat's amazing.\nAll right, let's um There we go.\nI'm gonna run over this.\nI think we can show this.\nI can show the PUMP fun ICO dashboard, right?\nYeah.\nYeah, pull it up.\nYeah, for sure.\nWe're working on a token one as well, just to give more insight into what's happening with the token.\nBut do you want to run over it or should I run over it?\nYou can go through it.\nI mean, it's pretty straightforward.\nI'm happy to add color as needed, though.\nOkay.\nWell, I was hoping you would run over it because I feel like I'm gonna embarrass myself, but I'm happy to run over it.\nIt's the first time I'm taking a look to the dear listeners.\nSo, I got 500 in the PUMP.\nShould I hold?\nGood luck, bro.\nLet's continue.\nICO participant summary.\nYes.\nSo, Dan, did you check?\nSo, this thing is cooked, right?\nIt says 3,000 addresses between 100 and 1K.\nThis is the one where that address matters.\nWhere?\nYeah.\nScroll down to there's like a sanki diagram of the distribution here.\nSo, yeah.\nSee this top piece here?\nIt's like roughly I don't know 20% of the known addresses.\nUm 500 of those are from a single wallet.\nOh wow.\nAnd so it's I mean I think it was what 10,000 in change that participated in total.\n500 were this one cybol.\nUh I don't know.\nIt's not like a huge amount by any means.\nSo it's just kind of interesting.\nWell, how how do you think it So does that mean that this account did 500 different KYC accounts?\nYeah, I mean it looking at the history.\nSo the 500 addresses had all previously been used for two other events, let's call them.\nOne was um so there was a token called Arctic.\nIt was launched by this like team called IBX exchange and ended up being like a pre-sale scam that's down 99%.\nAnd was somehow attached to Orderly network.\nIt sounds like IBX was working with Orderly and Orderly tried to like promote this as like a a way to get some marketing around what they're building and it totally ended up backfiring.\nBut nonetheless, this account, these 500 accounts that are all controlled by the same individual or entity, uh was able to basically farm that with this the same wallet cluster.\nUh so that was event number one.\nUh event number two was this other token called like Woo Kong.\nI'm not sure if it was a pre-sale.\nIt doesn't appear to be.\nIt looked like they did some holder count spoofing on this as back in the day.\nThis was about eight months ago, everybody was trading on the number of holders a token had.\nUm, wait, are you not still doing that?\nNo.\nAnd I recommend you don't.\nUh, but yeah, so this this cluster has been active in like spoofing stuff before, which I think is probably the most interesting.\nUm, you know, you think if you really weren't trying to be or if you're trying to not get caught, like one, you would not use address with history because now it's very clear what your intent is.\nUh, but two, you would also not use one single source like wallet.\nIt's pretty easy to\n\n\ncluster\nthose together.\nUm, but the other side of it is because there is history on these accounts, they look real at a very quick first glance.\nUm, so maybe that was the intent there or just like a low effort, uh, you know, in totality this one entity participated with 200 grand.\nUm, so $400 split across 500 wallets, 200 grand and the max limit was 1 million.\nSo you could have just done it under one.\nSo they must have the only motive there is you were trying to, you know, maybe there was a subsequent airdrop to uh users or small retail users that were participating in the ICO.\nI think that's like the only angle you could kind of concoct here.\nShout out to not a wizard for proposing that one.\nYeah, I think that I talked about, so we did a pod earlier today as well where we talked about this exact same thing and my take was that I don't know if you remember this, but on Ethereum, so there used to be like airdrops for participants in specific events.\nUm, I wonder if they're trying to set up a wallet, like I guess 200 wallets that whatever the number is.\nYeah.\nSo you mean like subsequent projects where like, oh, I want to target, you know, PUMP fund users, like if you IC participate in the ICO, you care enough, so like I want to air drop you kind of thing.\nThat's a good angle.\nI hadn't thought about that either.\nIt's definitely a good one.\nYeah.\nAnd then I guess $537 medium PUMP purchase.\nIs this ignoring those cooked wallets or does this include those wallets?\nIt, uh, I can double check real quick, but most likely that is including them.\nUm, it's probably marginally higher.\nUh, there is a large enough participation that this cluster probably doesn't make a massive impact, but um, I can rerun that and check in a second.\nAnd the unique addresses, is that unique users or unique wallets?\nWallets.\nSo there's no clustering involved in that.\nSo the 500 will count as 500.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nOh, sorry.\nGo ahead.\nNo, you go ahead.\nNo, if you scroll down to uh that Seni again, what's also interesting about this is the reason why this got built out is to see like where funds were coming from.\nUm, so it's pretty cool, right?\nLike a lot of funding came from wallets that already were on Solana.\nUh, so right, so they just swapped through a deck, probably sold soul, and then a lot of came like through bridges and sexes, which is also what you'd expect.\nUm, but that's also why like now that infrastructure is so good, right?\nIt's very easy to come from anywhere.\nYou have funds on Arbitrum, it's very low effort, like I mean, relatively speaking, uh, relative to like, let's say two years ago to get from chain A to chain B, uh, so I think that's kind of interesting, uh, where it's like everyone was like, oh, everyone's going to sell soul to buy this, like you could very easily sell Ethon at L2 and and use that as your source of funds as well, and we did see some of that um through these bridges as well.\nYeah, I imagine all of the exchanges are selling on another chain and then bridging it over to, or I guess it could also be washing so on a wallet so that people aren't.\nYeah, you could have done some of that.\nI agree with both takes, right?\nLike I use Coinbase as a bridge pretty frequently sometimes if I'm just, you know, have a wallet I'm trying to like uh deprecate anyways and like I put it back through uh Coinbase and then spit it out in a new wallet.\nYeah, I was I was pretty wrong.\nI mean, you can see that clearly, like people sold rad, like I guess Solana and Solana related assets on Radium, Sulfi, and Jupiter RFQ.\nUm, but in general, I think I was pretty wrong about how much of a liquidity vacuum it would create on Solana because that was my main argument and I assume that's also what you guys were trying to look at with this Sanki, right?\nLike where the assets are coming from and then.\nI didn't do a good job.\nI failed.\nAnd then I guess last caveat here is this is specific to the onchain ICO.\nSo you could participate through centralized exchanges, but we just don't have that data on hand.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nWhat's the funding on um.\nIt's like barely positive now still.\nCan you see my screen?\nIt's 0.33% annual wise.\nInteresting.\nIt's like near trending, like near zero.\nThis honestly, I thought this was going to be a lot clearer of a go up and up and up as opposed to what it is right now.\nI guess it has also been only 21 minutes.\nThe um.\nSeems like it's going to take some time to like settle this dislocation between the hype markets and the others.\nI think it's trading the same price on chain though.\nI think it's just market determining higher or lower at this point.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt does seem like, I mean, we're like very nearly converged across venues.\nCheck out.\nNot insane volume yet either.\nWhat do you think they do for the uh air for you know, airdrop if that's the direction they go?\nI don't think they'll air drop.\nI think they're probably going to do streamer rewards.\nI don't think they'll air drop.\nI think they got token buyin from retail or public or whatever you want to call it for the ICO.\nSo, I don't think they're going to be interested in doing it.\nI think that's the most likely path.\nIt's going to be focused on growth growth initiatives.\nLike we were saying before, we think that they're pretty, it's a pretty shrewd team with the capital allocation.\nThey don't seem to waste money and they don't have to.\nSo, it's like where do you deploy capital?\nYou deploy it in your into your growth.\nSo, so they're not going to do retroactive like airdrops to users.\nIt's going to be forwardlooking.\nWell, I might be wrong.\nOne, sorry, I saw a poly market chart, but then I remember realized it's 500,000 volume, so you can't really trust that.\nWhat was it?\nNow you got to stir the pot.\nAnyway, live 31 airdrop 60%.\nBottom 500k volume, which is it?\nSay that again.\nWhat is it?\nJuly airdrop by July 31st.\n60%.\n60%.\nThat's two weeks.\nBut it's only 500k volume.\nThis is just whether or not they do an airdrop.\nThis is when they airdrop by.\nInteresting.\n60% is interesting.\nIt makes me feel like someone knows something.\nYeah, but what like if I put 5K into that, how far do I move the market?\nLike usually these mean nothing to me?\nLike what's like an amount of money where it would be reasonable to like trade this with inside info?\nAnd then how much do you push the price?\nWhat is it?\nRyan, you guys are using KHI or Poly Market?\nPoly Market.\nI don't, I don't think I've ever opened K.I.\napp is actually pretty good.\nWhat's their market selection like?\nUm, I haven't really poked around outside of the Joey Chestnut.\nUm, lie.\nUh, I feel like it's pretty similar.\nSorry.\nI feel like uh listings velocity is equally as important there as it is on centralized exchange and purpose venues alike.\nLike you need, you need to get the markets people want.\nThey don't have any PUMP fund markets.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nI mean, they're, are they, they're not cryptonative at all, right?\nThis is by um, you might find this interesting, Daniel.\nThis is from Do you know Jason?\nDo you know Xerx per uh on Twitter, but not like beyond that?\nHe built out this thing called adjacent um and they do basically like they do data.json.news and they track um they track betting platforms and odds and they present it similar to news.\nLet me see.\nThere we go.\nAnd this is like their This is the PUMP fun one.\nAnd they like track the I think usually they aggregate stuff.\nIt's just their It's not loading, so it's not going to be a good ad for them.\nBut um usually they track multiple markets and they aggregate them together.\nSo it's pretty interesting.\nBut this one was just one market, so it didn't make a lot of sense.\nInteresting.\nThat's cool.\nOkay.\nI feel like the vibes are very low.\nI think it's because the market isn't going up.\nWhat are we at?\nIt said six on Hyperlid.\nI mean, the most boring come boring outcome is the markets were extremely efficient and the six uh the six price range is where the market's going to price it for the next couple weeks.\nCan you imagine, Ryan?\nThat would be very boring.\nHe's going to kill me.\nIt would make me the sole winner of a.\nOh, a bet that won't go live until Thursday.\nChat will find out later.\nI'm pretty.\n[Music]\nWhen I picked a token, it went up straight in a line for a week and then it stopped and then it went up straight in a line for another week and then it stopped.\nWhen you picked the token, it hasn't done anything for 27 minutes.\nI I wish it'd go down a bit.\nI wish it'd go down so that I could be stressed out.\nI want to get Liquidated and they just won't give it to me.\nWell, it went down initially.\nYeah, that's true.\nI don't know.\nThis is I mean some volatility going on here.\nWe went from six to five and a half to six and a half.\nPeople are kind of deciding.\nThe market is deciding, the all knowing market.\nI kind of regret buying it on purpose because I could have just shipped it in on launch for like 20% lower.\nI was too lazy to close my purse and bring you over.\nDamn.\nBMR is up again today.\nI was really hoping this thing got to like the 30s.\nThe house [ __ ] ship it in.\nTom Lee can sing songs.\nYou love this guy, man.\nDude, he can sell a dream.\nI said it the other day, but like Joe Lubin can't motivate a fish to swim, but but dude, Tom Lee, he's got he's got the sauce.\nHe can none of it.\nWell, not none of it, but a lot of it you can poke holes in pretty quickly.\nUh but who's going to spend the time to do that?\nHe's um yeah and we said on the other app that he has a new audience retirees in Florida who are watching CNBC.\nThey're going to be cryptofilled.\nYour friends dads that text you.\nYeah, that's who Tom Lee's talking to.\nAnd he's like talk about stocks like for like 25% of the family gathering and they like buy the ones with like super high dividends.\nThey like buy call call option strategy ETFs and like don't understand why it pays the high dividend.\nThey just know that they get account in the they they get they get a dividend every month.\nThat's all that matters.\nAll right.\nI got to hop.\nI got a call I got to jump to, but I'll be back.\nWe'll wait for you sir.\nI removed them.\nAll right.\nNow we can actually have some fun.\nI had a limit order and at four onchain price got to four too.\nTerrible.\nJeez.\nYou have a limit order on Jupiter.\nI did.\nYeah.\nFor the super like I don't know how well they do when it wicks super hard on chain though.\nYeah.\nLike if you're competing with a lot of high fee paying snipes, you're probably going to miss.\nOh, well, PUMP Spot is live on Hyperlid.\nOh, w do you remember when we had that fight?\nOur only fight we've ever had?\nWell, that's not true.\nWho?\nMe and you or you and Danny?\nMe and you?\nI've never fought with Danny.\nWe fought.\nWe fought.\nYou said that hype would never do well because it wouldn't ever get a.\nWell, you didn't say that.\nThat's wrong.\nThat's That's clearly wrong.\nBut we said that there was a cap because the asset non-hyperlquid assets would never come on.\nHyper liquid.\nYou didn't say that to be fair.\nYou said we didn't know when it was going to happen and it came on.\nI don't remember this.\nVery convenient.\nYou know what I say?\nA lot of things.\nYou have to have a lot of takes.\nThat's true.\nHaving a lot of takes is really hard.\nYou start to lose track.\nNo, this is one.\nOh, that's not.\nWhat did you do?\nI don't know.\nNo, but that's very true.\nAnd I have that as well.\nI I found that sometimes I just say stuff on the podcast without actually believing in it.\nDoes this happen to you, Danny?\nsaying things you don't believe in just to say something.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI think the other thing I do is like um I just straight up lie as well.\nSometimes I might feel a certain way, but I don't know like I hedge certain things or I'll play devil devil's advocate just to have a to provide a balanced view for the episodes.\nYeah.\nOh, what do we have?\nWe've got some content here.\nHold on.\nI'm I'm getting breaking news that we have some content.\nOh, this is actually wild.\nWhat is it?\nSurely we have to do a little bit of a flipping here.\nI think the market is the market's missing this one right now, huh?\nPUMP below bonk.\nThis just in breaking news.\nThat's very silly.\nNo.\nYep.\nRyan Connor said it first, fellas.\nIt's pretty silly.\nThat means it's going much higher.\nWe call that a free flip where I'm from.\nMore news coming in.\nThe news is just our producer sending us Twitter.\nBonai is weighing in saying actually I do want to share.\nThis is funny.\nBonkeye weighing in saying Bonk looks good here.\nI wonder why Bonkeye might be saying that.\nEither way, is Bonk is Bonk up on the Listing?\nThis would be interesting actually.\nIt's pretty I mean thinking of like the history of competition in crypto.\nThe bonk um kind of like it's not a vampire attack, but let's call it a vampire attack on PUMP volumes.\nI mean they clearly planned it for this, right?\nLike it's pretty coordinated and well thought out and I can't think of another time in crypto where I saw something like that.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI think Radium and PUMP is also a pretty clear one there.\nIt's like the original uh when Radium launched it, I think they probably built it out months before and it was like they just waited until it happened and then they went live.\nThe only more interesting competitive move I can think of is uh and FTX, dude.\nDude, he's so far out of.\nI don't think we can talk about CZ.\nCZ is probably the only person that I don't want to talk about that.\nAlso, Paulo.\nThat feels a.\n\n\nWait, CZ and FTX. You mean, like when he tried to... he didn't try to do anything? Let's not say that. He didn't do anything. I think that's a little... It's a little different though, right? Yes, it definitely. Oh, this is a good, actually good question from Westy. What do you guys think about CZ launching his own launchpad today of all days? There's this Kobe tweet from obvious motivations two years ago that said that CZ is probably the most competitive man in crypto, and I very strongly believe that, like Binance was the most dominant exchange, and it still is the most dominant exchange. Um, I can't imagine that CZ got to where he is by not being competitive. Um, so I don't... I think it's pretty on brand for Binance and CZ, right? Like, to try to compete on all fronts as much as possible. I'm not sure if it will do well. I like D, you have a better say on BSC than I do, but I... I'm not sure. Like, they tried with broccoli, they tried after that as well and before that. It just doesn't seem to be working out that well for them at this point. I'm sure it can, but I don't know. What do you think? What do you mean not working out well? Well, are they doing well on the on the volumes and fees and launchpad front? I don't know. I don't track it at all. So, I'm like probably very off base. Let me pull it up again. Um, they had been for a while though. Yes. Like Forme was one of the few launchpads that actually had any staying power other than PUMP. Oh yeah, that's... Yeah. And are they... they're competing with Formium now? Yeah. I don't actually know. I mean, do we have the details on this like release of Binancees on Launchpad? Let's ask our very own Jamie. I know. No, I just saw the headline, but I don't know if they're like going to... because they could just tap four meme in the background. PUMP just whipped down to fifth to five on uh, on chain. Yeah. I think they liquidated Sean. Holy. They're trying to liquidate me out here. Don't let them do it, guys. Don't say that. Dude, we're not... we're not moving the market on a $5 billion asset. You don't know that. Apparently, we moved the market on ETH and Salana. Hey, if any whales want to move the market with their 100 million and make me profitable, go ahead. I just don't think we got the sway over that capital. Let me see this. I don't know. PUMP doesn't look right. I think it was a failed experiment. I think unironically I was right. I'm trying to bottom it so hard, and it's just not working. I think the failed experiment going to zero. Let me pull up... Oh, wait. Is this not updated? Have we not updated? Our B&B stuff stops at June 30, so I don't have fresh data. Don't say that on the pod, man. It's updated, guys. Be a subscriber. No, this is my request to Sharples to to make to get this updated. They are launching. No. Uh, Ryan, you're right. It is together with Forme. Aha. Well, up until the end of the month, um, Forme was absolutely killing it. They were knocking it out of the park. Like, they had a billion and a half in volume on June 30th on the launchpad. I mean, they were doing like regularly a billion in volume every day for like the back half of June, which is kind of absurd. Wow. And I mean, we could say whatever we want about farming activity on Pancake Swap, for example, with the... what is it? With the Binance Alpha campaigns, but when you're on the launchpad, you're paying... you're paying the 1% fee or what have you. So, I'm... I'm taking a look at their coins. They're actually doing... there's a four meme trading competition. Yeah, I don't know. I... I think it's hard to have a really clear picture, Boach, while Binance and the B&B guys do all these trading campaigns and stuff because some of the activity is incentivized. Should we start get taking questions from the from the comments so that we have something to talk about? Yeah. Yeah. You want to start with Ian here? Thoughts on Launchcoin? Off the air. Brian will have better thoughts on Launchpin. Ryan, do you want to get... do you want to share some of your thoughts on believe and net new assets? I think... um, I mean, what's the data show on believe? I'm just interested. I know that they had a kind of big unveil, and now it's kind of leveled off, but I don't think it's a short-term thing. What would you say? Story if you're trying to onboard actual founders. That's fair. I'm trying to find... Next question. We're taking questions. I don't know how to do the question section. Boach, what NFTs do you like? I don't like any NFTs anymore. I have a Mady. Wow. I have some Mades. I have some puppets. I have... That's it. I got cooked on puppets. I heard were the board ape of this cycle. True. Who? I heard my ladies were the board ape of this cycle. They went up quite a bit. So, I'm... I still made money on them, but it's just... it's like a stupid thing to hold down. You ever like look at an asset and like you... you hold it down, and you're like, \"Why the [ __ ] did I hold this down? Like, I should have just sold it.\" How many malades are there in total? Yeah. 10,000. How many do you have? Why would we do this right now on the podcast? How is this relevant? He owns 10% of the supply, Ryan. Let's be... thousand Mades. No, but it was just like stupid to hold it down. It's one of those things you can't bring up to regular people. Yeah. No [ __ ]. Look at your position right now. I'm very safe here. I feel... I feel comfortable. You feel safe because usually people who feel very safe in a position have to keep repeating that they feel very safe. They are coming after my position. They're hunting my stops. I don't know. Price hanging out. Not... Dude, Launchcoin also looks ass. Everything looks ass, guys. Well, it is interesting the timing here. Like, Bitcoin had was kind of like trending up early in the morning, and it's been uh, headed back down the past few hours. Can I just say something? I'm really sorry about this. Like, realistically, he can't win this, right? Like, that's... I'm not closing this position. It's what... what does it say? Finish the year. What do you say? Finish the year below the... Yeah, he said finish the year before the amount they raised or below the amount they raised. Below the amount they raised. That was what he said. Yeah. Pretty sure he... he made a tweet. It was like they'll finish the year at an FTV below the amount that they raised. This is my favorite interaction. We'll put 1 mil on that classic. James Kristoff tried to strike a deal in the Zerx Research Telegram and was unsuccessful. So, James Kristoff was begging for a 54. He was literally like [ __ ] begging him. Who did... Kristoff on this right now? I don't think he's free. He has a day job. I'm asking him. We'll see. We need to get some motion in here. And James has the right... He's got the right idea. Oh, he cannot today. That's unfortunate for all involved. Yeah, it does suck. Let's do this. [Music] What are your thoughts, Ryan Connor? Let's get thoughts on Hyperlid for you. Thoughts on Hyperlid? Um, I like that everyone likes Hyperlid at this point. Fantastic. And it makes... and it makes it interesting to bet against it at this juncture or bet on a competitor because universally everyone's saying the same thing. So you kind of want to fade... you want to fade those moments in markets. And I'm exploring... I'm exploring um, a... a bare take on hype, but I don't know if I... I don't know if I feel convicted in the end. I don't know enough. Okay. Now, when you say everyone, Danny, with no offense, do you own Hyperlid? No. Ryan, do you own Hyperl? No. Okay. So, 67% of this large data set doesn't own Hyperlid. It's large data set. Chat clipped that of this statistically significant sample. Yeah. 0% own it. Yeah. No, it's... it's... it's interesting when that happens in markets, and I don't think that we'd recommend a formal short or anything, but if the valuation were to get very excited um, with competition coming online or just, you know, other tokens overlooked in that space, I think that it'd be... it'd be interesting to say to... to take the other side at this point. I think that's fair. That's fair. It's not... it's not today. Yeah. Also, like we've historically been very, very bullish. Hyper liquid, like starting from three, four dollars, we wrote our first bull hyperlquid post. Yeah, you've been ahead on it. Um, Karolina was early on it. Um, was much earlier than I was. Yeah, at any... I mean, we... you know, you've played it very well for our subs. Um, but it's always good to start thinking about, you know, how the... the opposite thing could happen. Your... your note on the... you know, that was kind of bullish hype, kind of bearish soul from a fundamental perspective, and it ended up being right more or less. Way too late. Like, two weeks later, they launched Trumpcoin on Solana. It made the most money it ever has, but afterwards, it did dwindle down somewhat. Yeah, it's... it's hard. I mean, it's like, yes, it did, but did it in a meaningful way? Like, I don't know. Um, it's hard to call tops on things. Yeah, it is. But um, I think you're getting to a point... you're getting to a point where you just want to think about it. I think you could see like a meltup in hype. And if you get a meltup in hype and it runs far away from where it should be, like when it... when it hit 35 the first time, like, I mean, we had this conversation, like, that was like... we were all bearish internally on it. We didn't write a note. We were pretty bearish on it internally. Yes. I was not, and I... I held it down like 50%. So, like, just FYI, I was wrong back then. Yeah. Really know. But I think, look, I mean, you're hearing whispers about um, like, and this is what I was saying in the Xerox Research chat this morning, like, you're hearing whispers about um, you know, Salana upgrades coming in the back half of the year that could, you know, make hyperlid style per possible. So, what does that do to an ecosystem that already has a bunch of capital in it and has like a devout and like um, enthusiastic fan base in the context of a hyperlquid thing or or in the context of hyperl... you know, I don't know. In my view, like, really not advancing to where it needs to to kind of run away with things, like... like if hyper core were like a meaningful... like had a meaningful builtout ecosystem yet, I don't think that that would that much, but I think it matters given the context that they're not... it's not hyper core isn't like really accelerating. So, yeah, look, I mean, I know you guys are going to hate this, but drift volumes are at alltime highs. I hate this. I literally hate this. Like, I don't hate any of... they're at alltime highs. They're leading per decks on Salana. Um, Jupiter kind of volume has really come down. Uh, so, so what's that say for drift token relative to hyperlquid token when all... all the DGEN attention is on Hyperlid and and everyone universally hates Drift? Like, I like that setup. I don't know. Yes, I have. Yes, I have used Drift, Westy. But that doesn't matter, right? What matters is the forward-looking thing where Drift can... where Salana becomes useful for market makers and um, and and the Salana blockchain can handle hyperlquid style like throughput if that's... if they can actually achieve that, it... it makes it makes for interesting competition. I don't know. Let's see. I... I don't... don't hate the take of potentially put drift playing catchup. I hate the take of saying hyperlquid is not worth the world going forward. And I think that's because... what? Sorry, what's... I couldn't hear you. I don't hate the take of Drift playing catchup. I'm still interested in Hyperlid as a token and ecosystem, but I mean, the pie is pretty big. I mean, just this morning, we're talking about launchpads and how many there will be. Like, there's clearly space for three or four and for different products to excel at different things. I think it... I do think that probably the Phantom integration must have thrown... like, the drift team can take that in two ways, you know, like, it can just keep doing what it is, or it can realize, like, look, like, we're... because the Jupiter thing is kind of easy, like, you can always brush it off by saying they offer free markets. It's for unsophisticated traders. It's like, we're not really competing with it, whatever. But like the hyperl... I think Phantom hyperlquid, if you're drift, you realize that I've never been a huge like fan of this idea that like Solana needs to have its own perex. Like, I think if Salana can offer Salana users a perex, that's great, but like, if Phantom can offer something, it's the same thing though. So, I think if you're drift, you have to realize, like, look, I might... like, Jupiter wasn't a serious competitor, but hyperlift could be. So, if they get the fire lit up under them and they can build some stuff out, so long goes well, the upgrades, then sure. I... I think the... I think the revenue numbers for... Wow. Let's go. Got a top holder of Palm joining in. How you doing, James? I'm back from being liquidated. No... just reloaded the pers account. You actually got liquidated? No, no, no. I didn't. I was just... I was just like tooling around with like the 3x leverage on Phantom. I wasn't really trading all that much. Um, I like what you're saying though, Ryan, from the perspective of like, I understand what you mean that you want to be able to take like a contrarian bet. And I think that makes a lot of sense. Uh, I feel like when...\n\n\nYou look back to like Solana a year and a half ago, that's very much what that was.\nUh, I think it's something similar to Hyperliquid that gives me those feelings that you're talking about is looking at Robinhood today and like the sort of like retail attention and excitement and FOMO there.\nUm, and it's maybe approaching a point or already at a point where it's like kind of a little bit running away from its like near-term forward outlook potentially.\nUh, so I understand where you're coming from on that perspective in regards to hype.\nIt's not an expensive token.\nI just I'm preparing for the moment that it is.\nEveryone has the same view, and that's interesting either on the upside or the downside.\nWhat do you think, James, for shorting Hyperliquid?\nUh, I mean, I think for me, the devil's in the details of like how you construct a trade.\nLike I'm always nervous about shorting anything in crypto.\nNot really because you're going to get the direction right or wrong, but just like how much capital you actually need to tie up if you want to give yourself like a decent margin of safety to avoid getting liquidated.\nUm, so on a token like this, to me, that's honestly almost more important.\nLike how how would you think about putting together a short on it?\nScale up the little bar on Liquidated and press the red button.\nNo.\nNo, I'm serious though.\nLike, yeah, like you could you could be totally totally totally right on that direction, but like the construction of this stuff is so possible.\nJust shorting like five days is so hard.\nYeah.\nAnd I don't think I I I don't feel like I actually want to short it, but I'm just getting, you know, spidey senses for when that moment comes.\nIt it's it's still a pretty cheap token and still I think taking market share.\nI think after this by bit Kraken blow up where they can't where they couldn't get allocation, I think you know you've really I think that they've really annoyed a lot of the DGEN folks, and that's going to you know that's going to make people reconsider.\nI mean, did you guys already cover this and like the the like the Phantom integrations and all that kind of stuff?\nLike I mean I know you had a kind of a whole pot on it, but did you talk about it all within the last five minutes with Connor?\nWe kind of did.\nNo.\nNo.\nWhat's up?\nTalk about it.\nJames, ask your thing.\nShoot your shot right now.\nJames, no.\nI mean, I love it.\nLike I I've been like a perpetual uh telling Boach to shut the hell up for the last like six months for Hyperliquid.\nUm, but no, I think like the Phantom integration stuff is like it's it's amazing.\nIt's just going to it's just going to keep um compounding on itself, right?\nAnd like Brian and I were talking earlier about drift.\nI'm like that's what I think is the biggest mode that Hyperliquid has, and I don't know why anyone would not want to build on top of it for um mobile UIs for pers.\nLike there's a couple things that I would want to change about Phantom.\nLike it's not it's not as clean as you'd want it to be.\nUm, but for someone who's like not a trader at all, it's very easy to jump on and just get leverage.\nLike they they they've done a really good job with the initial UI.\nI can't wait like one sec.\nLet me pull up some data on this.\nUm, can you see how much money you're making from the Phantom front end already?\nYes, I think they were making 40K.\nThey made 40K yesterday since launch if that makes sense.\nSo, I don't know when they build.\nAnd I don't know, this is like just pure vibe space, but the execution feels very bad when I when I trade on it.\nThis is not me making an allegation, but it just feels like I'm getting terrible fills.\nUm, which is good for the protocol, but it just doesn't it doesn't feel it doesn't feel right.\nWhat do you What do you mean?\nLike it it it's not like a super snappy like latency and like refresh.\nSo, I feel like when I'm actually trading versus the price that is being displayed is not the actual price versus um like you're not looking at like a continuous order book where you're seeing the price tick.\nYou just like basically refresh and they give you a price and then you click long and it's like all right, I was filled at, you know, 2% wide of that, which is fine.\nLike you are being filled at the prevailing price.\nYou're not getting ripped off.\nMy point is you just like don't actually know what price you're getting um before you hit long or short.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI think they're probably running the like Coinbase regular Coinbase Pro type of deal.\nYou know what I mean?\nOr like the Kraken regular Kraken Pro type of thing.\nAnd I did notice, I don't know if you guys noticed, like literally within the last like 15 minutes, they added up to 5x leverage on PUMP.\nUm, I guess that's on that's on Hyperliquid, right?\nUh yeah.\nShould we?\nYeah, they did.\nThey added up to 5x.\nI think because now it exists on other exchanges.\nIs my voice?\nYes.\nI think because they now have PUMP on other exchanges, they can get proper um oracles.\nWell, I guess it has native oracles, so I don't know why they opted.\nOne sec, Ryan.\nI'm going to do this for I'm trying to find the.\nHere we go.\nThere we go.\nOkay.\nBuilder codes.\nThis the top 20 is what is a builder code?\nCan you tell me what a builder code is?\nSo a builder code is it's basically a referral code and it allows um applications to monetize their front ends while using the Hyperliquid back end.\nDoes that make sense?\nYeah.\nSo it's basically that and paid for API.\nUh yes for API.\nYes.\nSo this is the builder cord's top 20 right now.\nSo, you can see PvP's PvP's made a lot of money.\nOh, wow.\nAxium has made less money.\nUm, Phantom is at 94K.\nI I don't know when that's from.\nDanny, when was the Phantom Pod?\nFriday.\nLast Friday.\nSo, no, four days ago.\nThree days ago.\nI think it came out late Thursday.\nI don't remember.\nBut yeah, it's within the last within the last 5 days.\n94 divided by 5 times 365.\nIf we analyze it, we'll annualize it.\nThat's 6.9 mil that they make per year, which is not a lot of money, but I assume they're betting on that going up going forward.\nSo, it's not a bad deal.\nLike essentially you don't have to build any type of product um apart from a front end.\nLike you don't have to deal with the back end at all.\nYou don't have to deal with incentivizing liquidity.\nYou don't have to deal with market makers.\nYou can just like plug and play basically and make.\nYeah.\nmake money.\nUm, it's a big deal if they can get some um I mean this is really interesting.\nIf they could get um like Fintex.\nYeah, because because Fintex want to offer crypto products.\nThey they probably want to first plug into something and um pers are super profitable.\nYeah, I mean you can like offer whatever Phantom is offering James Kristoff, which is I assume is not like the top and I don't think anybody expects the top experience from trading on a wallet, right James?\nLike when you log on to use Phantom to trade perks, you're not expecting the greatest execution ever.\nYou just want to like get in and out.\nYeah.\nNo, totally.\nIt's not for someone that wants to to you're not going to deploy a meaningful like serious position on Phantom, I would think, right?\nBut if if you're if you're out and you see something in the news and you want to put like, you know, some some level of size on, I think that's like that for for someone who's like in market seriously, I think that's the benefit.\nYeah.\nAnd it works out.\nYou make a little bit of money, you just have to pay up front and that's to build a buy sell.\nI assume a lot of like if I'm I mean the the like Max Fiji FIG who you argued with this morning, Ryan, in the X research chat, his like big argument is that which I think makes a lot of sense is that a lot of like you said Fintex, regional exchanges, etc. will plug into the Hyperliquid order book using either HIV3 or builder codes and essentially just leverage the Hyperliquid order book and backend to to offer users the liquidity that Hyperliquid has as opposed to having to like build it out, pay market makers, etc.\nI think it's a pretty like I know often we say like front end is the moat.\nUm, I don't know.\nI think like also being backend across like a lot of venues is probably good.\nIs that a hot take?\nI was just going to say like I think it's another step towards the future of like if if you want unified liquidity and you don't want fragmentation for people that are trading, right?\nSo, like I don't think anyone thinks that the end result of of crypto 5 years from now is like all these fragmented little weird exchanges trading the same instruments fragmented, right?\nLike you're going to have like in my opinion, maybe it's wrong, maybe it's right, um two huge colossal winners, right?\nAnd then then that's going to be it.\nLike you don't have this concept of of dozens and dozens of exchanges.\nAnd maybe Hyperlink can be that.\nWho knows?\nWe're going to see.\nI'm bet that I'm betting that it will be.\nA lot of people are betting against me.\nI'm dying in the order books.\nNot for I liquid, for PUMP.\nCan we talk about PUMP because it's one of like the unironically things that I've actually not hated and have actually been like genuinely bullish on?\nYeah.\nTell us your tell us your story.\nI feel like you used to be a PUMP bear.\nI used to be.\nSo, I think my view on crypto probably changed dramatically over the last like year and a half.\nLike I definitely I mean I still am like if you if you were to segment me probably like closer to like the Bitcoin maxi camp where I generally think everything is is a bit of a scam.\nUm, and not really sure why 90% of this stuff exists.\nUm, but PUMP to me and just like memecoin trading in general is just so transparently o transparently open about what it is and it's just like yes, we're offering you a casino with bad odds and a high rake.\nLike we'll be totally transparent about it and you can continue to trade on it if you want.\nUm, and they make money, right?\nAnd like that's, you know, if we're talking about like this whole revenue meta nonsense, um, they've been way ahead of the curve on this, right?\nSo like I don't know.\nIt's it's hard to it's hard to hate a business like that.\nYeah.\nAnd I'm not like I'm not I'm saying this in chat like I'm not a big valuation guy when it comes to crypto to be completely honest considering because my portfolio is mainly Bitcoin anyway.\nUm, but like it's pretty hard to me when you look at like traditional venture uh valuations like how you could look at a company with that much cash on its balance sheet and think the valuation is like four or five times cash, right?\nAnd obviously I'm not I'm not going to get into like token versus equity because whatever who cares it doesn't matter for this purpose.\nUm, but if you slap on like a standard multiple of something that has that much cash on it balance sheet, like that thing is valued at like 50 billion bucks.\nYeah that's that's the really compelling part.\nUm the the the cash that it has post money is very interesting and that it already had um assuming you know that that it made over the past 12 or 15 months of operation or whatever.\nUm, I haven't said a lot about it because the the equity token split, but that's a pretty compelling part.\nLike who actually controls that cash?\nI think it's muddy.\nBut yeah, that's it's I feel like I feel like this IP ICO is a gift frankly.\nYeah, I think I think you I think you buy this now and barring like a total collapse of crypto markets, right?\nLike one year from now, I I don't see how this thing is not trading materially higher, assuming we're still in in somewhat of an uptrend.\nWhat if somebody was already long and they were losing money and then also they were paying funding?\nWould you would you tell them to keep the position open or would would you give them different advice?\nI I would advise not taking a fundamental view on perpetual futures.\nPerpetual swaps probably not the best idea.\nThat's a fair point.\nYeah, I probably shouldn't have done that.\nAlso, like I don't know.\nI'm I'm crazy.\nYes, you're screwed.\nI I might be crazy for thinking this, but like there has to be the revenue announcement and staking coming out in the next couple of days, I think.\nMaybe.\nNot financial advice.\nI'm just guessing.\nUm, but if like imagine if Alon tweeted right now that the 25% rev shares is confirmed and it's coming within the next, you know, two days to the UI, like I don't know, this thing probably trades up 50% in a candle.\nI wonder if they'll do something like revshare only for stakers.\nWhy would they allow stakers?\nWhat are they?\nNo, just for rev share like you'll lock it up for like six months or whatever and it's kind of this like you know kind of scam tokconomics where you just stake to remove cell supply.\nThat would be such an exit signal.\nSorry, but it's true.\nStaking is a re it's a retail trap especially with tokens.\nYeah, I think historically that's right and it's sad that that's right because I do think it's pretty interesting like if you in traditional markets if like you only receive the dividend if you agree to lock up your thing for a long amount of time.\nThat's pretty compelling.\nBut yeah, I just think you've seen so much abuse that like you can't do it.\nYeah, it it's just impossible because in equity markets, you have e the equity, you don't have the token.\nSo, I'm I'd be way more inclined to lock up my Nvidia shares for five years or whatever uh for, you know, some, you know, bonus that they're going to offer me on top of that.\nBut would you would you rather the team take 25% of the revenue, convert it to stables, and just airdrop it to you or use it to buy back the token?\nI would rather have the cash.\nWait, run it back.\nWhat did you say?\nWould you like So, let's just say there's a revenue return.\nWould you rather have\n\n\nThe revenue return take the form of stables directly to your wallet like incremental to how many tokens you held during like a you know snapshot period or would you rather have them just buy back the token on a predetermined timeline?\nWell, it's I I would prefer discretionary buyback because of the tax efficiency.\nNo.\nYeah, that that wasn't the angle I was going for, but yeah, I was thinking more in terms of like I don't necessarily would want a buyback within crypto.\nUm, but yeah, that's a fair point.\nI mean, I'd rather they like grow the business, but if I have to make them do it, then yeah, buy back the token to be honest because I think the other factor there at play is potentially like the liquidity question mark.\nHow much does a dollar of buyback equate to in terms of like a return on the asset price versus them giving me a dollar in my wallet that I then immediately pay tax on?\nIt's tough though.\nWe're working with so many assumptions like the how the market treats like doing a buyback at all versus not doing one.\nUh how just using the money and operating as if you're a business is like maybe not quite viable just yet unless you want the token to suffer.\nI'm on my cell phone right now.\nCan you tell me what funding is right now, Buck?\nI mean, I see people's messages streaming in.\nIs it like wildly negative right now?\nNo, it's a thousand% positive.\nNo, wait.\nIs it really?\nYeah, that's what I'm over.\nI gotta I gotta close and then buy a spot.\nI think I'm not.\nI gotta close so the market can go up.\nI'll sacrifice I'll sacrifice for everyone else.\nIt's over.\nYou're welcome, chat.\nI don't know why I perked this up.\nWow.\nSo, I actually did not realize this.\nI'm not looking at my phone.\nThe funding quoted to me on Phantom is hourly and it is not every eight hours.\nDo funding rates actually matter?\nI mean, I know that they matter from a dollar's perspective, but like are people constructing trading strategies based on funding?\nLike, can you use them to time the market?\nI don't know.\nI just don't want to pay a thousand% if that makes sense.\nYeah.\nI mean, I think it's just like the cost of doing business.\nSo, if it's very expensive to hold your view, you got to be really damn convicted.\nYeah.\nI think it's too expensive for me, unfortunately.\nAll right, I got to run, fellas.\nThis was fun.\nI I'll be in the chat.\nThanks for having me on, James.\nHow do we feel, folks?\nGetting um keep getting blown out live or what?\nNo, I think we're done, right?\nIs this enough sadness?\nWe're gonna You're gonna close out your position, end the stream, and then the market's going to wick straight up.\nYeah, if it gets closer to your liquidation price, Boach, let's get back on.\nI sold my\nWell, I actually did not box out.\nNo, I'm I'm send the chart.\nI I sold my I I sold my pause.\nI actually did not.\nIs such a Bach move.\nThat's one day he sold it all, he's out.\nThe next day it's up.\nOh, no.\nI never sold.\nHe's baiting the candle.\nNo, I'm I bridged over to the spot.\nHe knows the MM are in their bag right now and he does not want to tempt them any further.\nNo, I bridged over to Soul and I'm betting there.\nNo, I bridged I swapped over to Hyperlquid spot and I'm betting there.\nNo, I'm actually going to buy BTC in this one.\nI did not close my market.\nI may have closed it.\nHe did not close it.\nHe might be closed.\nIt just doesn't make any sense for me to hold\nOh my god.\nAm I fully filled now?\nHoly guys.\nHyperl's great.\nAre we done?\nI'm gonna go puke.\nHuh?\nYou're back in?\nYeah, I'm back in, but on the spot side, guys.\nI'm all right.\nI do think that this goes up in the long term.\nYep.\nAnd I don't I think James Kristoff was right in that you should not have a fundamental position open as a burp.\nThat makes no sense.\nTherefore, I've swapped over to spot.\nAll right.\nAre we all happy?\nI'm not.\nWe can call it there.\nAll right.\nI expected some more activity on this, but bit of a quiet day, it seems.\nSo, we'll see how the rest of the week shakes out and uh we'll be talking about it.\nYep.\nGoodbye.\nHave a nice day, guys.\nThanks for watching.\nWow, he just left like that.\nThat's crazy.\nWell, I'm also going to leave now.\nGoodbye, Danny.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nDeep\n[Music]\ndip
