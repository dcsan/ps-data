  "cleanText": "Cool. Okay, great. So, hello everyone. Um, hope you've been having a great ETHCC. Uh, so, you know, first of all, you know, thank you to uh, you know, Jerome for organizing uh, such a a lovely event and uh, constantly figuring out how to do it very well in a new city for a couple of years in a row. Um, you know, thank you to everyone who made this uh, event possible. Also, thank you to all of you who have been such a big part of making Ethereum possible. Um, so today I'll talk about decentralization and uh like basically what I think is the need to shift from thinking about decentralization um in terms of building shiny tech uh to thinking about decentralization in terms of concrete properties uh that we're trying to guarantee to users. So to motivate this um I thought we would uh go back uh 30 to 40 years uh in uh history right and uh so first of all think about internet enthusiasm in the 1990s. So who here can recognize either the quote or the person who made the quote? Okay. Um good more I think more people should. Um so this is uh the declaration of the independence of cyberspace John Perry Barlow 1997. Uh so a very famous document in the uh general cipher punk and internet freedom world. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. you have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear. So this was of course the uh sentiment uh at the time and uh you know of course uh as uh you know we know now it's uh actually protecting the uh independence of online global social space is something that is uh much much uh more difficult than uh just making a few statements. Um and uh um you know there definitely are lots of uh methods of enforcements to worry about and uh I mean a lot of the ways that the internet turned out in general ended up being very different from the early types of Web1.0 visions uh that happened right both in terms of government control and also in terms of corporate control right so Web1.0 know this was the era where everyone would have their own server uh where everyone uh would be completely free as an independent content publisher. Um things would things and people would talk to each other all on an equal level and then in the next decade of course we had Web2 and Web2 moved from this open internet to the uh the world of the walled gardens. So let's see what the people building the world the walled gardens had to say. Um, who here can recognize either of these characters? So, second is I think one of the co-founders of uh Twitter and the first is of course Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and connected. So, who here has seen something basically philosophically indistinguishable from that on the marketing copy of a crypto project? Okay, a lot of people um people have this the second one is fun, right? People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information um and uh that social norm is uh something that has evolved over time, right? So remember the 1990s the 00s this was like the peak of this uh transparency mentality you know the world is a peaceful place everything is going well any kind of abuse of power is only going to be localized and so the solution to abuse of power is to actually have even more transparency further above it so we can shine a light on it and let's make like everything transparent and if that happens on an equal level then things will be great. Of course, you know, this did not happen and I think of course now the discussion has moved much more toward the side of uh privacy being something that's like actually really important and necessary. And of course uh you know the idea of social media as this egalitarian marketplace of ideas, right? Anyone can put their ideas out there and if they resonate they can spread like wildfire. So these are of course uh I mean in some ways things that have been realized but in some ways they're also definitely not the properties that the internet has as of today. Um this is another interesting quote. Uh so uh this is from an article by Philip Ragaway a very famous one the moral character of cryptographic work. I would uh highly encourage people to read it. Um and uh the core points that Philip Ragaway makes is uh basically that people who are working on cryptography really need to more actively think of cryptography as uh something that has social and moral implications and something where you actually have to actively think about what the uh social and moral uh implications of the thing that you are building are. And uh in this section of uh the article, he was basically trying to explain his theory of why a lot of cryptographers did not want to do that. And uh basically just wanted to say, well, you know, no, you know, we're just geeks. We just do math. Other people figure out that stuff. And one of the explanations he gave is technological optimism, right? And like basically uh saying that uh you know technology is uh by default something that is uh extremely good which is true and there is plenty of charts that you can point to to show that uh you know while there are downsides of technology on the whole the relentless upward march of any single indicator just uh ends up overshadowing basically all of them. But uh at the same time right uh like that does not come for free and a lot of the time good things that happened in technology did not happen automatically. They happened because people recognized that there were things that are wrong and took specific actions to try to fix them. like uh the fact that the air in uh you know like even cities such as uh even Cannes is breathable is itself the right the result of specific actions that were taken to deal with earlier problems like pollution. Um and so the argument that he gave is basically that uh if you're too much of a technological optimist on then you basically think that uh good flows almost naturally from the entire category that you're doing and so the most important thing is to just uh accelerate and uh know the direct the magnitude is more important than the direction. So of course um you know as we have seen um this often is not the way that things turn out right and so now let's get to the question of uh like where we should be thinking about all of these issues in terms of crypto and I think the argument that wants to make is that today we're at this uh inflection point where for probably the first 10 to uh 15 years of crypto it was uh more like relatively easy to argue that the most important good is growing the space. And of course, yes, things that are happen in the space that are chaotic and yes, you know, the internet happens because of porn and so it's uh okay if uh you know, crypto grows because of uh all kinds of crazy stuff and uh you know, there's multi-million hacks happening. Um but uh now we're at the stage where it's becoming very uh unambiguous that the space as a whole is not an underdog upstart, right? The the space as a whole is something that's very mainstream. It's being endorsed by major corporations. It's being endorsed by major political figures. And so when we're at that point, growing the that space uh like or at least growing the fraction of humanity that it represents is not a clear automatic good by default, right? And the thing that is the good is actually making sure that within the context of these tools, we're actually building the right kind of thing. And so I I would argue that today we like I think we have been seeing this shift but we need more of a philosophical shift from saying build with blockchains, build with ZK, build with FHE, build with whatever to saying build in a way that accomplishes particular properties. And often the most important thing is not being more clever at nerd problems, right? Often the difference between a good solution and a bad solution is not the nerd problem. It's not like what fancy math you can make. It's not, you know, can you figure out a way to do this really clever thing in analog end time, but it's like often something that's like much more uh simple and like both kind of simple and uh and tricky at the same time. So basically, you know, level one we're decentralized because we have the top decentralization K's as advisers. Um, level two, we're decentralized because we use decentralized tech. Level three, we're decentralized because we make our users free. So, if you're building something, the first question to ask is, are you making your users free? So, we could go through some specific examples, right? So, one of them is uh layer 2, DEXes, other types of applications that have sketchy properties, right? So, this is uh a thing that's happened in the space for the last few years and uh the L2B crew just deserves a huge shout out for just like being uh amazingly on the ball for just continuing to create accountability on all of this, right? Basically, when you have an L, like you can call whatever you want an L2, right? So, uh you know, 10 years ago, uh in Estonia, they had a thing that they described as being a blockchain. And what they basically did is like they took their digitized government records and like every day they made a hash of it and then they published a hash on their Website and I think in a couple of newspapers somewhere, right? And at the time this was revolutionary. This is like yay this is an enterprise blockchain use case, right? But then the question you want to ask is well was there even any specific person who actually like went through that pathway and like actually benefited from the trust guarantee that this created right and like quite possibly the answer is not necessarily right and so here what we see is uh there's a lot of instances of uh layer 2 financial projects all kind of projects where they basically have instant uh back door buttons um or still at stage zero or claim to be something like stage one but actually are not stage one um or that have upgrade buttons where the upgrade button can happen instantly and there's no way of stopping it um where there's no exit window. And if you do these kinds of things then theoretically in terms of technology you're building on chain but practically in terms of properties like it doesn't actually end up being much better than a server right and so if you're building something where you're not comfortable making it decentralized then quite possibly the answer actually should just be to make it a server. Um, example two, uh, DAP interfaces, right? So, this is something that we've actually seen as, uh, late, uh, over the last like half year or so, right? So, basically, you know, you can have amazing formally verified contracts. You know, you have your smart contract that's uh, only a few hundred lines of code. you have like 10 auditors, you know, you have fancy auditor koss from C from nine continents, you know, including two on Mars that managed to figure out that the thing has no bugs in it. Um, then you know, you have formal verification from uh companies on the other five continents to figure out uh, you know, that everything is safe and then it's like all perfect, right? But the front end that everyone uses is replaceable by hacking the server, right? And so if you have a design like that, right, a design where the back end is like theoretically super awesome, but the front end is a house full of straw, then an attacker is not going to attack your reinforced steel door. They're just going to move one meter to the left and they're going to attack the straw and you know, the wolf knocks the house down and the pig still gets eaten. Uh so the solution to this is basically yeah static HTML pages doing versioning on I directly on IPFS creating ways for users to directly access web pages through IPFS and also more advanced solutions. So okay contract was uh is one that I know people have been working on creating like more specialized and more restricted uh ways of uh of doing interfaces. I know that there are other interesting projects uh doing things like this whether in RISC-V or whether in other languages. Um so improve basically yeah once your smart contract is perfect like the DAP interface just has to actually be something that we focus on right. Um, example three, governance attacks, right? So, if we talk about, you know, governance and uh decentralization and the underlying goals of protocols being governed in a decentralized way, right? there is this uh kind of paradox where there's sort of the approved um um like the like standardized way of doing governance which is basically a to a a token holding DAO and that it makes proposals and everyone votes on the proposals but then actually like we've seen that approach fraying more and more over time and we've seen that that approach even if it's theoretically decentralized at the L1 it ends up like structurally leading to centralization Right. which just completely changes the underlying logic of the mechanism when you can go and buy decisions. Uh so governance is something where you don't just need to think about the formal rules being decentralized. you need to think about whether or not it's enabling outcomes that are decentralized. Um, example four, ZK identity, right? So, uh, this one is interesting. I mean, I'm I'm sure some some of you have seen this uh, you know, this meme was from the a post that I wrote last week on the subject, right? And uh basically in this case the argument is well okay so you have zero knowledge proofs and you're using zero knowledge proofs um on top of an identity system right and if you use zero knowledge proofs on an identity system then you know this is great and you have privacy and uh you know you can prove that you have an identity without revealing which one and these things are all amazing right but then the question is well you know do you really have privacy right and actually some like there are situations where the privacy that you get from a ZK is easy to overrate and the loss of privacy that you get from enforcing a stricter one per person property is actually the thing that's easy to underrate right and so basically yeah if everyone knows that each person is limited to having exactly one account that even if anything is leaked by default well anyone can just coerce you into revealing your master key and if you and if they force you to reveal your master key then they can see every single thing that that you've done right and there's even kind of default pathways through which this happens right so there's this common user interface workflow of like signing in with an application sign in with Google sign in with Facebook sign in with whatever and the problem is that in that workflow it's kind of inherent that you're giving one application the ability to see your state from other uh from other applications right and So there's a difference between basically saying you know we have something which has zero knowledge proofs inside of the process and saying we have something which is actually doing a good job of uh making our users free. Um example five is privacy. So who here has used a privacy protocol in the last 30 days? Tornado Cash, RAILGUN, Privacy Pools, Monero, Zcash.\n\nOkay. So, out of those people who have used a uh privacy protocol, how many of you have used um have made sure that uh when you were using that protocol, all your privacy wasn't just getting leaked anyway through a centralized RPC provider? Okay, I see one very brave hand up on the right. So, uh amazing job there. So privacy is again something where we need like we needs to move away from this mentality where the success condition is building amazing gadgets to this mentality where privacy is not a feature that's being added rather data leaks are a bug that is being reduced, right? And and data leaks can happen in many places. Data leaks can happen when you write to the chain, so when you send transactions. Data leaks can also happen when you read from the chain, uh so RPC calls. Data leaks can also happen on the IP level. So if you do a send raw transaction, even if it's through something fully decentralized, if an attacker takes over a large portion of the peer-to-peer layer of the network, they would still be able to see which IP things came from, right? So privacy also is something that we wants to really uh look at much more holistically, right? So these are kind of some of these uh examples to watch out for, right? And so the and so then the question is well, what are ways to think about what are the ideal types of things that we should be will trying to build towards, right? So a few tests. So one of my favorite uh tests uh and I you know have to credit uh Luri for this one. Uh this is the walk away test. Basically, if your company and all of its servers suddenly disappear, do your users still have their assets? Right? Now, this is like the most baseline thing that you should be trying to get out of your assets being on chain instead of your assets being on a server, right? So right now we have a lot of uh projects that are coming up and uh you know they have assets that are uh they're coming coming up and they're coming on chain and they also are increasingly uh like actually trying to serve mainstream users, which means serving users that uh don't already have Ethereum accounts. And so the question basically is, well, what actual property is that user getting from being on chain that that user would not get if the whole thing was being done on a server, right? And the most basic property should be, if the company disappears, the user's assets are still safe, right? Now, how many providers actually do this, right? Um, I think uh I mean, how many people here know, right? And this is a question we should be asking, right? So, actually, yeah, quite a few do do a good job, right? So uh like the Privy embedded wallet for example, it actually has the ability to export your key um and and put it into another wallet, which is uh a really valuable and important feature. So like props for that. So there are a lot of like individual wallets and uh even individual applications that do a good job of this. Um, another example of this here is Farcaster where you the the Warpcaster or I guess they're now called the Farcaster client has an option for you to set the backup uh to be whatever address you want. And by doing that, you effectively you can have your Ethereum account be the root of your identity instead of uh something that's controlled by a Farcaster system. And so you're able to permissionlessly jump around between different clients. So these things are all good. Um, so basically there's a lot of things in the ecosystem that do actually pass the walk away test, right? And if they do, then like this is amazing. And the reason why this is amazing is because they're fulfilling the goal of decentralization, not just as a thing that they say they have because they are on chain, but actually as a thing where you can point to a specific concrete user story that a user is able to do and benefit from because the thing is decentralized that would not exist if the thing was not decentralized. More challenging one, insider attack test. If someone hacks your company or an employee goes rogue or you go rogue, how much damage can they do? So the UI layer is one of these very natural points of this, right? But uh there's also other points. There is uh upgrades. Uh, you know, can your contract be instantly upgraded? Um, then, you know, can the UI get hacked? Can the oracle uh get like how difficult is it is it to corrupt the oracle or can the top five holders of the governance token that make up 55% of the supply force through a decision that just like grabs up all of your assets, right? So this is another thing where again, a lot of projects in the ecosystem I think have been doing a great job of uh like seriously thinking about these issues, but it's something that we like really need to insist on much more as a first property trusted computing base. How many lines of code are you trusting not to rug you? Right? So the fewer lines of code you're trusting, the more secure you are. Now, 2 million lines of code are lines of code where they're not actually trusted, right? And if they do something that has a bug, then there's like other code that actually denies it the permission to do anything uh serious, right? And like for example, the browser does a good job of like forcing separation between HTML and CSS and JavaScript uh to make sure that like actually only the JavaScript part is uh trusted, right? So there's a lot of different ways to reduce this right, but uh like basically if the trusted computing base is too large for anyone to practically inspect, then even if the thing is trustless in theory, it's not trustless in practice. Um, so and then finally, another one, analyze the properties of the game, right? And I think this is uh kind of what the most subtle one and this is the one that I think connects the most to some of the examples that I gave earlier on, right? Which is basically, does the game that you're creating, even if it's credibly neutral in some formal sense, unavoidably lead to some kind of abuse or some kind of excess market concentration? So Web2 turned into Web2, and uh that was not because primarily because of anything uh like that was centralized in the rules of Web1, but rather because Web1 created an environment where by far the easiest way to do certain things was the centralized way, and centralized players got network effects. They had incentives to create walled gardens, and then the biggest ones won. And then even though email is theoretically an open protocol, in practice, if you don't use Gmail or one of the two or four other big ones, then you have a very hard time. Um, so there's equivalence of this in the in the crypto space. Um, there is uh equivalence of this in crypto projects. Uh, so for example, uh if you think about the problem of like how to do data backups, if you don't provide a good uh decentralization friendly way of doing backup, so then either your users are going to constantly lose all their data or like things will drift toward a centralized solution, and then they're not actually getting the benefits, right? And so basically not just thinking about the decentralization properties of the thing itself, but also thinking about the decentralization fairness, market concentration properties of the game that is being created by the uh the protocol. And like this applies to Ethereum itself, right? Ethereum needs to think about staking, Ethereum needs to think about uh think uh about um like DEXes and uh different types of transaction sending economics. It applies to applications on top of it, applies to Layer 1 successes and uh the failures of uh Android. Linux has mass adoption, right? Here kind of Linux that's not Android. Actually quite a few, which is good. But uh in Android, like Android has done a lot for mass consumer adoption, right? Actually, I mean, more recently, other Linuxes are starting to succeed and I think both uh as developer platforms and increasingly as gaming platforms, which is like really cool to see. Um, but we could ask the question, has Android made users more free? Has Android made users more safe? Right? These are things that free open-source software is supposed to try to do. And I think the answer is well, sort of yes, sort of no, right? So if you have an iPhone, you do not have the freedom to install an application without going through the App Store and without, you know, the the overlord um Apple and like getting the 30% cut. And you know, recently of course that was uh you know, like knocked down by some legal decisions to some degree, but uh you know, like for the whole point of open-source software should be to try to like actually make these things fair at a very uh low technical level, right? On Google Play Store is one that has lots of vendor crap, crapware installed. It has a bunch of spyware. It's uh in some cases designed for security, in some cases it's very not designed for security, and it's an ecosystem that's like very inconsistent in those regards, right? And so I think uh Linux as this uh really interesting case study to look at, right? Basically, a lot of the early motivation was basically ensuring that the mobile uh software ecosystem was uh as free as possible, and you know, it succeeded in some ways and uh it also did not succeed in other ways. And I think uh you know, as a uh a as a crypto ecosystem, right? First, um, we you know, we don't just want to succeed, we want to be something that is worthy of succeeding, right? We wants to be something where the next generation can look at it and they can say, yes, this is something that actually is um create built bringing openness and freedom and fair permissionless access to the masses and is not just yet another interest group of people who have a thing that goes up in value that are trying to make their thing go up in value more, right? I think if we lose that, then Ethereum inevitably just becomes a generational thing, and then it inevitably just uh passes just like a lot of other things have passed before, right? And so when we build these things, you know, we have to put ourselves in the shoes of who we were when we first decided to join Ethereum and we were not yet convinced that this is uh the ecosystem to uh to be contributing to, right? Like what kind of properties actually made us interested in going here instead of going in the uh in other directions in the first place, right? And so if you kind of can you know, basically imagine uh you know, what kind of an ecosystem would it be that would actually motivate someone who does not yet have the bias of you know, having ETH, having social connections and so on, to also wants to make the decision to come in and become part of this community, then like we will have made something that's uh actually lasting and that's like actually really capable of uh making the kind of uh more free and uh and more open economy that we all wants to see. Um, so also a social answer, right? I think uh this one's important. Uh, don't give yourself. If you start analyzing um like some of the ways in which things like Web2 and even things like Web1, um and parts of crypto itself, um end up going in a more corporatized direction. Often it ends up starting with very well-meaning people, but then those well-meaning people over time go uh uh form into an entity, and then once there's an entity, that entity has incentives, and then once that entity has incentives, it starts having connections to other entities, and then uh you know, you have friends, you have connections, you have people you don't want to offend. Um, and uh like that ends up being a big force in itself, right? And like that's also something that like we just do needs to be uh very mindful of, right? Because uh you know, ultimately your incentives and your social environments do have a heavier influence on you, and this is uh something that is extremely difficult to control. Uh, so it's uh important to think about not just like the things that the ecosystem does directly, but also what kinds of like how the ecosystem rewards things, how the ecosystem funds things, and having more models for that, having more models that allow projects to be financially successful, but at the same time ensuring that things like open source, open standards, security, privacy, censorship resistance continue to be taken into account at every step of the way. And you know, we don't go down the path of OpenAI where you first give up openness for safety, and then you give up safety in order to grow faster. Um, then like we we can actually make sure that we're going to be a better ecosystem. So I think uh you know, how do we do these things? There is uh no one single answer, right? But there's a collection of a lot of smaller answers, right? And I think uh to me, the the social this social answer is one big part of the answer, and uh the other big answer is like the technical answer, right? Which is basically, yeah, thinking about um not building technology, but thinking about building things that have properties. And earlier on in Ethereum's history, like building technology is the right thing to do, right? Like, okay, so who here remembers like decentralized Uber in 2015, right? So it was fun, right? Who here who here took a ride on a decentralized Uber in 2015? So, okay, I see one person bravely raising their hand. That's good. Uh, so, you know, when you were building decentralized Uber in 2015, I think it was like obvious to everyone that the version of the software that was being written, it was like basically a toy and it was not going anywhere, right? The project would go somewhere, but like come on, you totally have to rewrite the code. We'd have to rewrite the L1 that the code runs on. You'd have to um like rewrite a bunch of details about the logic. And really the whole thing was this like really beautiful experimental grounds to just try lots of different and really cool things, right? Right now in 2025, when people are building decentralized Ubers on Ethereum, the goal of the decentralized Uber is to like actually get used by people, right? And so in here, like we actually need to think not just about kind of progressing our branch of uh of the amazing shiny tech tree, but also like actually think about about what kinds of properties we're trying to achieve, what are the specific things that we give to our users from a decentralized system that we would not be able to give them in the context of a decentralized system, and like actually building the infrastructure and building the uh the layers of uh the stack with that in mind. And I think uh this is something that we've made uh a lot of moves toward, but I think this is uh something that we can continue to do much further. So thank you. Heat. Heat.",
