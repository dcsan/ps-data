  "cleanText": "Hi guys, welcome back to the live stream here at Proof of Talk. My name is Gareth Jeninson. I'm the head of multimedia at Cointelegraph. It's been a fantastic pleasure to be hosting this live stream throughout the last two days here at this event in the heart of Paris. We've chatted to a lot of big founders, a lot of big names in the industry. And we're actually coming to you now on the live stream with an exclusive, very uh exciting announcement between Peaq and Pulsar coming out of the UAE. Something that I think is really, really exciting for the space in general. Before we get started, I want to encourage you if you're watching the live stream to drop some questions. We will pose them to Till and Karen as the conversation goes on. Um Till, welcome to the show. Uh it's great to to finally meet you in person because some of my teammates have spent some time uh integrating and talking with Peaq over the years. Tell us first of all about Peaq for those uh viewers out there that don't know what Peaq is, and then we'll we'll get into the announcement after that. Yeah. Hi uh first of all, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm Till, one of the founders uh of Peaq, which uh is a layer one for the machine economy uh in a in a broader scale, but obviously that includes lots of different uh different parts such as DePIN, um but then also decentralized physical AI, financial aspect such as machine DeFi. Um yeah, and uh pleasure, pleasure to be here today. Let's talk about this this announcement because there's quite a lot to unpack. But um the long and short, uh the UAE is opening up a new special zone and they're going to start uh exploring and using um your infrastructure and uh blockchain-based payment systems to to power DePINs in general. But you can probably explain a lot better than that. So please do. Yeah, I mean, we've been working on this uh has been in the making for quite some time. Um I think the first time also we got in touch, um that was approximately a year, if not even longer, uh some longer time ago, and um yeah, there we really um started to to elaborate and and and and understand how Peaq can can benefit the UAE and also vice versa. And when it comes to building a machine economy, then that obviously also involves physical machines, right? And um they need to be somewhere, they also need to be at a physical location. And um when we thinking about the the UA UAE as one of the most advanced, if not even the most advanced place in the world. Um also when we're looking at smart city development and um yeah, everything around improving the quality of life of the people, then um that's a great place to to start. And I think today we are super excited to uh yeah, um finally unveil what we've been working on, which is basically uh yeah, the machine economy free zone um in the Emirates. Karen, I'm going to bring you in here. Maybe you can chat a bit about Pulsar and how this uh partnership came together. Sure. Thank you. First, pleasure to be here. Um so Pulsar is a venture studio based in Abu Dhabi. Uh we support companies such as Peaq with uh founders with long-term vision who wants to come to the UAE and deploy their technology into into the government. Um we see the UAE is actually pioneering in the web3. Um I don't know if you know, if you saw recently, but actually Dubai uh announced that they are going to be the first city in the world to tokenize real estate assets, right? Um and I think it's very interesting to see the um how the government always think of what's next uh and therefore we actually decided to support Peaq as part of our uh portfolio companies. We also support Solana uh and eToro and a few other uh very interesting and pioneering uh companies uh and we're very excited to see what we can actually bring to the UAE. How much did you connect the dots to make this happen because I mean, like a machine economy free zone sounds super exciting. So you know, uh I think when it comes to the UAE, uh sometimes uh for founders it's quite confusing how to navigate, right? And that's where Pulsar come into the picture. Uh we support them, we help them to build the products uh and we actually help them to adopt um their services into the uh governmental services.\n\nSo I'm going to throw it back to you uh in terms of Peaq, the evolution of of the protocol itself, um the different use cases that have evolved over time. Talk us a bit about that, like what the idea was originally versus what Peaq is today, and then we can touch on this machine uh economy uh free zone and and what that's going to look like in 5 years. Yeah, happy to. I mean, uh there's a long history around Peaq. Um it's it's been a it's been a rough journey, so even more excited to see where we stand today and now also um rolling this out uh um on a yeah, on a nationwide level. Um but yeah, it really goes back to, I would say approximately 2016, 2017, the first wave of the ICOs where we yeah, had the first ideas of a real decentralized um machine economy, like really enabling um different machines to not only communicate between each other, but then also to exchange value logics. Um but yeah, at that time, um a lot of the infrastructure wasn't wasn't really ready. So we went a lot into enterprise development. We basically built DePINs, if you once on an enterprise scale with large machine manufacturers. We built uh paper use model for paper use models for machine leasing, um larger asset value machines. We built uh a decentralized charging application with the Volkswagen group um involving the different brands also being able to communicate between charger and vehicles, and um that really gave us the requirements um for for Peaq as it is today, where we realized, okay, we can now enable, we should be able to enable others building those as we call them today DePINs. And as of today, we have around 65 uh of them on top of Peaq. We now see a lot of all decentralized physical AI applications coming on Peaq. We see um machine DeFi evolving on Peaq, um as a very interesting concept, um yeah, really has a financial aspect to to this machine economy. And um yeah, we see around 7 and a half million, 8 million uh machines around the ecosystem. A lot of them are on chain already, and um yeah, more and more joining every day, and it goes from all kinds of devices, be it um yeah, like sensor data from weather stations up to yeah, real, real robots, autonomous robots on top of the network, um as I said, charging stations, um yeah, all kind of. I would like to add on that, you know, for us, what we see that is super interesting to actually explore and to brainstorm around is how actually to engage engage the citizens of the country to really engage and to be part of this machine economy, right? If they can actually invest or buy a part of a machine that makes coffee or uh whatever it is, right? But uh and to generate income and yield out of it. I think it's super interesting and I definitely believe that it can actually happen in the in the UAE. I've been to the UAE many times and like nowhere is as fast moving and innovative as that. And like I guess that's my next question, like what is what is the future look like for this machine economy zone? Uh what are people, how are people going to be using Peaq? What what what will that experience be like for people in a smart city that's powered by this infrastructure? Yeah, I think we can really break that down first of all into four core pillars. Um one of them is regulation. The other one is um the deployment itself, but then also innovation and investment. And in a nutshell, when it comes to the the the regulation part, we'll be working a lot in the direction of um machine RWAs. We've seen the UAE being very advanced when it comes to, for example, tokenization of real estate, um now taking that uh on a different level, like autonomous machines, robots, um yeah, that's that's that's one of the of the of the of the larger um keystones in this initiative. Um obviously also regulatory other regulatory topics, but really working there also thanks to Pulsar, um trying to really work with the regulators on that. And um when it comes to um the deployment part, right? Like um we have a lot of, we see a lot of, lot of DePINs, um building on Peaq now, some of them are also data DePINs, but also resource DePINs, um yeah, like um there's nothing more valuable than than um or yeah, like making data accessible for smart cities. And then also in the future, when you have autonomous machines in the cities, they need to coordinate, they need to navigate and being able to access um to access that data. And um yeah, like we we finding, finding the right um ways and having that zone where we can where projects and DePINs can come, uh robotics companies can deploy those machines without thinking about, you know, too much, too much about uh, you know, certain topics. And then innovation, um uh really building an innovation hub together also with Pulsar and investment, obviously also um yeah, tapping into those uh visionary investments. Karen, maybe you can just chat a little bit about the the vision for, you know, a machine economy zone and what the UAE wants that to be in in 5 years. So I, I think, you know, since the UAE is so advanced in their thinking and their adoption and open mind, um in terms of like how to bring more products, I think it's a great environment for Peaq to try and to experiment it, right? I think for any other project who has like a long-term vision as well, uh to come to the UAE and to see how they can actually adopt the government is very open to uh to help and to see how they can actually uh adopt, and because of that, they actually make uh I think every quarter or so around tables around different topics uh in order to hear more ideas, um and obviously with the DePIN, uh we we aim to also create this kind of brainstorming uh sessions with more founders, with more companies, with more DePIN, DePIN companies uh to see how we can actually support them, and I think that's the best environment for them to be in, right? So, um you mentioned that you were in the UAE. It's funny because anyone that I I met who came to the UAE, they come with exactly the same um uh experience and expression towards the UAE. So, it's very exciting. I think uh it's going to be great. Um and I'm sure we will be here in five years down the line and we will uh we will see many robot cafe and many, many other have an interview with with our humanoids. Yeah, someone's going to take my job. Um so I'm going to throw a few questions your way just from the the live stream. Uh one of them coming here from zero trust Tony, you talk about autonomy for machines, but who governs the code running them? Can you talk a bit more about like Peaq and the protocol and autonomous machines and and why you actually need infrastructure that allows them to do what they do autonomously? Yeah. Um so when we're looking at at at Peaq, then um yeah, we built that for a reason as an as an own layer one um network because we really focused also a lot on making sure that we that we have an actual layer of trust between all those different machines, devices, robots, um which includes then also aligning on identity standards, for example, set machine identity standards, aligning on uh universal basic, universal machine time so that the machines can really sync and communicate and and exchange, change um yeah, and and and access and all these kind of logics that are coming with it. And um yeah, that's why we built, build Peaq in a way that everything is executed in runtime, you don't have um you don't need applications building uh all their own smart contracts and so on, um which then need to, you know, synchronize uh again, need to be upgraded when um there is there is uh a new, then there is a new identity standard or something. So really everything is happening on a protocol level, and that's um yeah, the foundation for all of uh the different deep pins and applications on top of. Is there a is there a short-term, medium-term sort of road map for how the infrastructure is going to be used and and how the this zone will start using, you know, uh different different applications to be a smart city, let devices collect data, do XY Z? Maybe you can talk a bit about that now, specifically in the emirates or sorry, yeah, in in in the in the machine economy zone itself. Yeah, um I don't think we can go too much into the specifics now. Um unfortunately, I would love to because it's super exciting. Um however, I do think we yeah, we will see a lot of those devices and a lot of those machines literally being like on the streets in um yeah, and and in different buildings have to be used. I obviously the release has just gone out, and I think uh if you're interested in reading that, it it'll be online, so you can find on the Cointelegraph website and a number of other news websites. But um one of one of the interesting points that I found was like we're very much in the future now, right? I mean, like Elon Musk's, you know, sort of autonomous robots moving around is a reality that everyone is going to see in the next two to five years, you know, um making those that kind of technology accessible to people, um making those devices autonomous, making um be able to, you know, share data and do these kind of things. It seems like the the possibilities are endless, and that's why you need to move so quickly to have the infrastructure to build this, right? Uh maybe you can talk about that vision. Yeah, it when it comes to the machine economy, it also comes a lot to composability, right? That those machines are able to um yeah, identify each other, that they're able to exist in a trusted environment where they can exchange and and communicate with one one another, right? And um yeah, I mean, I I I think now we really have a really solid foundation. That's why we also attracted a lot of a lot of builders building building on top of Peaq. Now what we see also coming into the equation is not only the infrastructure with with DePINs, but also intelligence, giving machines access to intelligence. Um but now also with machine DeFi, giving machines access to financial resources and financial system, and um yeah, we see that happening at at lightning speed. If someone would have asked me about machine DeFi, where I was, you know, philosophizing about machine DeFi like five, four, five years ago, um you know, that you will be able to use a share in a tokenized robo cafe in a or in a in a delivery board or whatsoever, um in a boring lending system, for example, right? As a real collateral, then I was like, that's 10 years away, but now we see that being um yeah, all constructed on Peaq, and I think that's that's just super exciting for the next couple of months. Yeah, and then having a place also to roll this out, right? Yeah, I've got a couple more questions from the live stream. How do you protect deeper networks from being taken over by centralized telecoms or cloud providers? Um it's quite a complex question, but maybe you can unpack a little bit, maybe even just from a Peaq perspective, how that protocol works and how it's safe. Yeah, I mean, um taking over an entire token system, I think that's generally very difficult by its nature if it's let's say built up in a proper decentralized way. Mhm. Um cuz how do you, how do you buy the entire network, right? As soon as you start buying, you're also lifting up the price and like in in larger scale. So I\n\n\nI think that's generally a little bit more difficult.\nUm, if I mean someone could try to pay foundations to take the network.\nI, I, I think that's very, very difficult to do.\nMhm.\nBy the nature of web3.\nUm, but yeah, obviously we also try to have as many incentives in the system for projects to build, remain in the ecosystem.\nWe have, for example, um, system pools like pools that are inherited in the native protocol.\nSo from every transaction that happens in the network, there's a part going in into so-called machine subsidization pools, also deepen staking pools where we will um empower yeah, systems like deepen staking uh in the future to incentivize deepens even more uh machine subsidization to help them subsidizing new machines.\nUm, then the D5 protocols are also plugging into these pools, filling those pools from trading volume.\nUm, so yeah, really trying to build up also a lot of protective mechanisms and incentive mechanisms around it.\nUm, my final question to you just to wrap things up.\nUh, when it comes to the Peaq ecosystem, what what's your favorite application that that you've seen in terms of of how people have used Peaq?\nYeah, there's so many, like honestly, I don't want to shill just one of them.\nI, I, I even use them myself on a daily basis.\nUm, now we see also some of them tapping data deepens, for example, tapping more and more into browser extensions where it's very easy to just, you know, um, yeah, use them on a daily basis.\nFor example, I mean, one that I just used yesterday because I booked an Airbnb, I downloaded the browser extension from Sencio, and when you are on the Airbnb homepage, um, you can, you can just switch it on and it shows you the noise level around your Airbnbs, and I'm someone that's very noise sensitive, so for me that was like a real decision maker yesterday, um, to check all the noise data and understand that this is one of the Airbnbs that that I that I rather want to book than the other.\nYeah, that's a great one.\nAnd I like for those people out there that don't, don't really understand like the incentive for you being a part of Peaq's network and offering that data.\nSo basically you download the Sencio app or whatever, or you connect to that, your phone is picking up all the data of the sound and it's delivering that to that, and then someone like you who's the end user benefits.\nAnd if you're if you're allowing your device to provide that data to the network, you get incentivized to do that.\nCorrect.\nYeah, that's correct.\nAnd that's just one of many applications and many interesting hardware that's running on Peaq.\nThere's more and more machinery coming with machine DeFi now.\nSo where you're able to uh finance also larger asset machines.\nI think we'll see also a lot of um yeah, more bigger machines on the network.\nAnd uh yeah, but but yeah, it's one that I used yesterday.\nLike literally, I like that for my own good.\nYeah, I, I like that.\nI mean, like I always want to hear about real use cases and like that's a prime example of that.\nUm, till Kieran, thank you so much for your time.\nIt's really exciting to hear about this machine economy free zone that's just been announced in the UAE.\nWe will watch this as Cointelegraph with great interest because I think you couldn't tell us too much, but we'll we'll get more details as it goes on, but it's very cool to to see deepen projects like this um driving ahead.\nThank you so much for inviting us and I think we would love to welcome you as well to come and to see it in real life, right?\nYeah, definitely.\nAbsolutely.\nThank you very much for CEO lives and works in Dubai.\nSo, we'll touch base all fair and we'll make that happen.\nThank you so much.\nThank you very much for for watching this interview.\nUh, we will keep them coming throughout the afternoon.\nSo, keep it locked here right at Proof of Talk in Paris.\nUh, we are covering it live.\nCointelegraph and proof of talk together.\nWe'll be back in about 5 or 10 minutes with the next conversation.\nThank you very much for watching.\nThank you.\n",
