  "cleanText": "The only thing we know to be true is nobody wants to die right now.\nI've spent millions of dollars to come back and realize that the most powerful things you can do for your health are free.\nThe last Bitcoin having is in 2140.\nYeah, I want to be around for it.\nI want the Bitcoin community to be around for that.\nWe're here at Bitcoin 2025 with none other than Bryan Johnson from Don't Die.\nHe's a man who's well respected for his work in longevity research.\nFirst of all, let's start off with Bitcoin 2025.\nYou were on stage here.\nWhat is someone like you doing at a Bitcoin conference?\nWell, there's a lot of things we have in common.\nI mean, I really focused yesterday in my talk of how to take care of your personal health when you're building, and obviously people in the Bitcoin community are working very hard.\nIt's a new technology.\nIt's moving very fast.\nAnd when you have that kind of ecosystem, you are incentivized to not sleep well, to, you know, try to sleep by in four hours of sleep a night, maybe have pizza, like ramen.\nAnd so I wanted to talk about like the basics of taking care of health because um most people like when you're grinding that hard are suffering with some kind of mental challenge, either depression or anxiety, not feeling your best, then that you gain some weight.\nSo trying to figure out like how to talk about these in ways that would help them feel confident in building uh in a rapidly evolving space and also feel great.\nHow do you view Bitcoin in general?\nI mean like do you hold any Bitcoin?\nDid you hold Bitcoin in the past?\nUh do you view it as a freedom technology and uh where do you see it playing a playing a part in someone like you who might not die, who might live 200 years, you know?\nYeah.\nSo I mean the the last Bitcoin having is in 2140.\nYeah, I want to be around for it.\nI want the Bitcoin community to be around for that.\nYou feel it's like it's like it's really important that we think about uh our lifespans in that kind of time frame.\nAnd uh so I joke about it, but I'm also serious like why wouldn't we all aspire to be around to see that last Halloween happen?\nLet's talk about don't die.\nI mean different people have different opinions about what it is to be human.\nAnd I think it's like the three certainties in life: death, taxes, and whatever the other third one is, right?\nShould we live forever?\nYeah, a don't die says really nothing about living forever.\nIt only says nobody wants to die right now.\nOkay.\nAnd so when you talk about like how does humanity figure out how we cooperate on any kind of anything um like we like we agree upon democracy as a form of government then we um or like on capitalism as as a monetary system.\nDon't die is the singular thing in existence that every human on the planet agrees to every second of every day.\nMhm.\nAnd so it's really trying to say as we give birth to super intelligence and we're having to ask these fundamental questions, who are we?\nWho are we together?\nWhat is society?\nHow do we function as society?\nWhat is AI?\nWhat does AI mean to society?\nI'm saying that the merge point for all of this is nobody wants to die right now.\nSo really, it's an attempt at answering the most consequential question all of our existence in this moment.\nAnd can we choose life?\nLook, there's a lot of people online that say the way you're approaching don't die and the way that you approach your health protocol is just not accessible to the normal person on the street.\nHow do you how do you approach longevity that allows the normal person that that's only earning a few thousand dollars a month to to follow this protocol and at least extend their life lifespan and just be a healthy human in general?\nYou know, the the funny thing is I've spent millions of dollars to come back and realize that the most powerful things you can do for your health are free.\nAnd so that's I've built everything I do around basically lifestyle choices.\nLike deciding that my bedtime is 8:30 p.m.\nI go to bed at 8:30 p.m. on time every night.\nI make sleep my number one life priority.\nThat's a choice.\nYeah.\nRight.\nI can actually abide by that with my lifestyle routines.\nAnd so I spend the majority of my time now talking about how you can get into health and wellness, get rid of the chaos that like that surrounds health of like too much going on, everybody disagrees and you can basically collapse it into a few simple things.\nAnd so yeah, I think it it's accessible, it's doable, and the majority of the benefits are achievable through these basic practices.\nYou made mention of of coming to this conference and just being involved in the cryptocurrency space and giving people some practical advice to be healthy while they're building a startup or, you know, trying to trying to work in this industry, travel a lot.\nUh, I mentioned to you that I flew a 10-hour flight from Amsterdam to Las Vegas.\nI changed times.\nI mean, I flew for 10 hours, but I left at 12:00 p.m. and I landed at 3:00 p.m.\nSo, I only lost 3 hours of time.\nBut now, 2 days later, I'm wrecked.\nUm how should people be approaching a lot of travel, a lot of work and what what are some very easy practical ways that they can kind of approach this and yeah try and be as healthy as possible?\nYeah, for international travel, I mean it absolutely wrecks the body.\nSo anybody who is traveling internationally a lot, just be aware like there is a price you're going to pay and you can't avoid it or you can do to minimize it.\nSo when you fly, try to fast on the airplane.\nOkay?\nIt's better to have an empty stomach so you have a better likelihood of sleeping.\nM uh no alcohol.\nWhen you step onto the airplane, the first thing they give you is a glass of alcohol.\nDon't do that.\nUh then they have a screen in front of you blasting your eyes a red light.\nTurn the screen off.\nSo no alcohol, no blue light, no screens, no screens.\nUh and then try to sleep on the plane.\nThen when you land, try to when you wake up the next morning, work out first thing in the morning.\nAnd also eat.\nYou want to tell your body, we are on a new time zone.\nWe're going to adapt to this new circadian rhythm.\nBut you don't want to wait.\nSo exercise and eating first thing in the morning and then start your protocol.\nSo just try to adapt as much as possible when it when it comes to the philosophy around AI.\nI mean you're advocating for people to live as long as possible by by living healthily when we get to a point of convergence with AI and and we can upload our psyche onto a onto a computer chip.\nWould you be one of the people that wants to do that?\nUm and and how do you feel about Yeah.\nLike the you know artificial intelligence and humanity?\nYeah.\nWe're in a spiritual we're a spirit in a a vessel and we have created artificial intelligence and and technology.\nDo you think the two should merge or are you a a humanist?\nYou know, I really don't have a perspective uh because like that will happen the way it happens.\nIt's so far off.\nWhat I will say though is um we have this absolutely urgent imminent existential question before us.\nYes.\nOf how fast AI is progressing.\nI think society is sleeping on AI.\nWe don't understand how serious the situation is.\nIt will become apparent in the coming months and years, but it is so significant.\nAnd what I'm saying is in this moment, the thing that the only thing we know to be true is nobody wants to die right now.\nYes.\nLiterally, that's it.\nIf you take anything else in existence, you have disagreement among everybody.\nBut that's the one thing we agree upon.\nSo if we bridge that to AI and say AI, we're going to build AI with this that we say existence is the highest virtue.\nThat is our whole thing.\nWe don't want to kill each other anymore.\nWe don't want to kill oursel.\nWe don't want to kill the planet.\nWe just want to exist and secure our existence.\nYeah.\nThat's what I that's what I'm building towards.\nOkay.\nMy final question to you.\nYou have you have a great presence online on social media.\nYou have a lot of haters.\nYou there's some hilarious stuff out there about you.\nHow do you maintain such a positive attitude dealing with social media and all the craziness?\nYep.\nBeing human is hard, right?\nSo, like when people are criticizing me, they're mostly projecting about themselves.\nAnd I empathize with them that it is hard to be human.\nUh it hurts to be human.\nAnd uh like I think people see me of like, okay, you're rich, you get to do this.\nI'm pissed.\nAnd so I want to meet them in the middle and be like, I understand where you're coming from and I want to be useful to you.\nLike I when I was building as entrepreneur, I didn't have anybody in my life, nobody that would say, \"Bryan, you need to prioritize your sleep.\nLike you need to eat well, you need to exercise.\"\nNobody.\nPeople are saying like, \"Work harder, sleep less, sleep under the desk, right?\nBecause that's what you really do to acquire status.\"\nSo I'm nobody trying to step up and be like, \"You can and should, not should, never should.\nYou can and it will be in your best interest to make health your number one life party.\"\nSo really, it's I don't view it as hate.\nThey're just working through their own stuff and it's cool.\nSo, I want to be there for them and like be be the voice in their in their ear that you can do it.\nYou can say no to the bad stuff and say yes to good stuff.\n",
