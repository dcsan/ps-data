  "cleanText": "[Music]\n[Music]\nHello. Hello everyone. I hope you're all doing well. You're watching the live Current Telegraph AMA. I am your host, video producer here at Current Telegraph. Now, we all know that the website space is full of ball builders and ambitious ideas. But getting those ideas founding and supported, that's another challenge. So, for most projects, it's a scramble for grants or VC money. And even when you do get funding, it's often short-term. So, what if there was another way to have a more sustainable way? One that rewards real usage and long-term contribution. Today, we are talking about one project that's trying to do exactly that. It's called Status Network, a gerium layer tour that's designed to support builders through native yielding.\nAnd over the next half hour I am really really excited to welcome very special guest and his us on how it works different and why it might just offer a new blueprint for west refining. Now without further ado let's welcome our host today um our guest sorry meets on Status Network product league and hello how are you doing today? Hey Seline, doing well, how about you?\nI am doing fantastic.\nReally happy to have you here. Um I just want to uh remind our dear listeners to like our discussion and share it with your friends and on your feeds. And if you have any question on this topic um that we're covering today, just type them in the comments below and I will try my best to answer them at the end.\nAnd now before we get to the first question together, um we have prepared a short video to tell our viewers more about stages work and we can take a look at it.\nAll right. Sip. First thing first, let's talk about what makes Status Network different. Um most layer through today's rely on transaction fees as a core business model and to be fair like that works pretty well so far but as network scales competition increases gas become cheaper those margins start to shrink. So with Status Network you have taken a very different approach so gas luction and are completely like a new revenue model. Um I was wondering like was this like a move to future proof your economics from the start or did it evolves and for those who are new to that could you break down how the business model actually works?\nYeah thank you for that question. So um yeah as you mentioned a lot of blockchains are based on gas and this is mostly for two things. First it's for securing the network. So making sure that operators of the network, validators, provers, whatever makes the network secure are actually paid. Um that is one stream of revenue for them. Another one is inflation to token invasion. Um and and the actual most important part is the spam protection.\nUh because um blockchains uh can be abused uh if they don't have a gas fee. Uh people can basically post a lot of transactions to them for free. uh making the network suffer suffer uh just because of basically getting spammed by too many people. And so we kind of looked at that and be like yeah okay this is how most of the blockchains work today right uh they just charge a very small fee and and actually you can see some research coming out uh of um like very recently about how Bitcoin for example has a lot of spam happening on their on their blocks because their gas fees are too low um and and so now I was looking at that issue and be like all right so we have three things here first we need to make sure that we can actually pay for the operation of the network. Second is we need to protect the network against spam. And third, we can see an industry-wide trend of gas fees going to zero or going very very small which actually increases the spam happening on the on the blockchains. And so we looked at it from a different perspective and we thought, how about we make the blockchain entirely gasless, no gas fees for anyone as long as you don't spam. And how do we prove that we don't that we are not spamming? We basically implement um it's called a rate limiting notifier. Um and it's a way to make sure that any accounts um an app or even like end users can are not going above a certain kota of free transactions that we give them. And that kota basically uh runs continuously. So as long as you don't spam the network, you can basically use it for free. And you're going to say, &quot;All right, so we that maybe solves like two of the issues that we mentioned, but how about the revenue?&quot; Right? So the problem with gas fees going to zero uh for a lot of L2s and actually L1's as well is that the revenues from those networks are also going to zero. Um and that's a big issue right because how can you ensure the security of the network if you're not able to pay well either your validators your provers your nodes uh whoever runs the network. Um and at the same time you can see that a lot of L2s have and a lot of other ones as well have a very high TVL uh and that TVL that TVL is basically sitting in the bridges doing nothing um and is not really a protective liquidity. So what we what we thought was how about instead of making people pay for the operation of the network by paying a gas fee anytime they do a transaction, how about we make them just bridge as they would normally. But then we use the yield on their deposited assets to pay for the operation of the network. And when running the projections what we saw was as soon as we reach a certain level which is like around 100 to 200 million of TVL then the operation of the network is basically paid for and above that everything above that is basically free to be distributed to the community and this is where the very interesting part of that model is is based on our estimation and based on the initial um setting ings of the network we will have 30% of the gas fees sorry of the um native yield that is going to uh pay for the operation of the L2 while 70% of it will actually be able to be given back to the community in the form of liquidity incentives or in the form of public good funding and that's a fairly new model because we basically enshrine the entire idea of funding liquidity and incentivizing liquidity as well as funding apps within the network uh while still paying for the operation of the network of course. Um and um I need to mention something else um is that we are going to make revenues based on the native yield. So any yield bearing assets that is bridged from the L1 to the L2. But also uh very interestingly we are going to have what we call native apps and native apps are apps that are going to give out a certain number of their uh fees about 30% back to the L2. So, for example, we're going to have a native DEX. We're going to have a native CDP and stable coin. We're going to have a native token launchpad. And all those different apps are going to give back a part of their revenues to the L2. And that the L2 of course is going to distribute it as I mentioned before, one part for the operation of the L2, but 70% of it for the community.\nOkay. you mentioned like a lot of very interesting things about um your business model. I just want to go back quickly like to um the revenue part um as you mentioned you know like a big part of your revenue comes um from native yield on user deposits um but yields across D5 protocols can fluctuate you know um sometimes dramatically. How do you manage like that volatility and you know what happens if yields drop significantly?\nYeah, that's that's a good question actually. So um first of all we need the deposits to be secure right um so it's pretty evident that we are not going to use like longtail den vaults and so on and then like super advanced strategies uh or like multiple super heavily uh uh leveraged looping. Uh this is not definitely not the type of yield that we're going to get after. Um so as it stands at the moment we're going to open with uh ETH at the beginning and the ETH will be deposit deposited into Lido. Um no loop no like leverage nothing. Um so just state ETH so like a 3%ish u 2.9 I think right now um on ETH. Um and then all the stables. So we we plan on um accepting USDC, USDT, USDS and D. Um they will all be deposited in uh like they'll be kind of segregated, right? And and deposited each in the vault or strategy that gives the best uh riskreward uh yield for us. Um, so you can think about morpho, you can think about a uh for USDC and USDT. And for uh USDS or die, it's probably just going to go directly with Maker or or Sky. That would be kind of the low like least risky uh way to handle it with still like some not too bad yield. Um, and what happens when the yields drop? Um, so two things, right? Um, first of all, it all depends on the TVL for us. Um, there there has been a race to TVL in a lot of different protocols, but in the end, they don't really take advantage of that TVL. For us, every the easiest way to think about that is every 100 million of TVL that we will add um we'll give $1 million straight to app funding and we'll basically fund well enough the entire road operation. Um so uh even a decrease in the yield by one or two or even three basis points if we look at stables um will still of course reduce the total amount of fees that we make as a as a chain but if the TVL is not is high enough uh we will not have any issue to pay for the actual operation.\nThat is also why the native apps are so important because they will also uh process volume. So you have kind of two variables here. One is like stocks which is just like the deposits. So the TVL and the other one is the volume. So what is the actual liquidity doing and and like how um how does it move in in the L2? Um and so based on those two things um the native yield gets is is issued by the TVL so by the stock and the native app fees come from the volume. So even if rates like yields drops but at the same time we have an increased activity uh on on the on the R2 um then again we will still be able to make some fees and and redistribute it back to the community. So, it's kind of edging on kind of both sides at the same time. And that's very interesting. I mean, you just mentioned, you know, like um you guys just launched like um your own native apps um that's obviously, you know, um contributes to additional revenue to the network. Can you walk us through like what those are um and what role they play in the bigger picture?\nYeah, so native apps are not launched by us. Uh there are like third party organizations. Um they are different teams. Uh what we do though with them is we make a deal which is pretty simple. Um it's kind of a token it's a token deal, right? Um, we give you uh governance tokens over the network so that you're able to provide free transactions at scale for your users and you're able to actually um get some fees out of the funding pool if you want to. Um, and in exchange for that, you give us uh part of your token supply so that we can get some fees uh out of your business model. And and so the the way we we work with those teams is basically uh we look for one lead per vertical and that lead becomes kind of enshrined into the L2 and so one DEX one token launchpad uh one stable coin and so on and so on. Um so we are also if there are builders uh watching that stream we are also looking for uh an NFT marketplace at the moment uh as well as a per deck. Those are like the two other categories where we we are in touch with different teams but we're definitely open to uh uh have a chat with more builders uh if you have some some good ideas around it.\nSo maybe you know um talking about developers um for those uh who are watching this um do they get uh to tap into this revenue as well or um is most of that heal flowing towards infrastructure and protocol sustainability.\nYes. So um I think I need to start mentioning about the governance of the network because this is how you get the funding basically. So um to get free transactions on the network um we need to have some way to assess whether an address so an account like an an end user or an app has the actual rights to uh do a lot of transactions. And how do we measure that? We basically measure it against your contribution to the network. Um and so the more you give to the network, the more the network will give you back. Um so we called it karma of course. Um and so what is karma? Karma is a non-transferable sole bond ERC20 just a coin that sits in your wallet. Um and it can only acrue. So you can just have your balance increase again as long as you don't spam. If you spam you get slashed. Um and that karma balance basically gives you your kind of level if you want into the the whole L2 game. Um where with a higher balance of karma you get a higher free transaction throughput. So you can do more transactions for free. Uh that is worth again for end users but also for apps and more importantly um you get governance power over the funding pool. Um, it means that you're basically able to say, I want that stream of revenue to go to that app, to that protocol, to that uh open-source project, uh, to that team or even to that kind of multi, right? We don't really care about where the fonts are going to as long as it's basically governed by karma. Um, so the cool thing is that it allows for a lot of different cool protocols to be built around it. Um you can look at convex convex for curve you can you can look at what happened with parat chain for example with BGT um there's a lot of cool stuff that can be built around that and so for the native apps all the interest is to first accumulate karma um and second um to be able to um direct voting like direct votes to themselves and for example they can do liquid grants to people who vote for them. So they basically give their own tokens in exchange for people voting for them. Um so there's like a lot of pretty cool mechanisms that are going to be revealed as we go. Um but the the foundational layer is we have that non transferable governance token and people will be able to use it for G transactions and for voting on the public uh funding pool.\nOkay. I want to dive like more into karma. Um I'm I'm wondering like you know the big question is who actually decide like which apps get founded and how does you know karma um factor into that process?\nYes. So um it's going to go through gauges uh very basic uh stuff in crypto where um you vote with your token uh and the kind of percentage of or ratio of tokens that gets voted for number one choice number two choice number three and so on they all gets proportional amounts of funding in the end. Um, one thing before I I get into\n\n\nThe dynamics of that is very important.\nUm, the funding is not going to be in a governance token, a utility token like a shitcoin or whatever.\nIt's actually going to be in ETH and stable coin.\nThat is the actual yield that users are going to be able to receive or apps are going to be able to get from the funding pool.\nSo, it's like real funding and it's immediate, right?\nAt the end of the funding round, you actually get all those uh tokens in your wallet.\nUm so there's no kind of retro funding, there's no like locking, there's no vesting and so on and so on because we don't we don't need to.\nIt's actually just ETH and stable coins that we allocate to um to funding public infrastructure.\nUm so for for karma, how does it work?\nUm it's not possible to buy karma.\nUh karma can only be obtained by uh having by contributing to the network.\nUm and so how do you contribute to the network?\nUh you contribute through basically three things.\nFirst is you stake S&T.\nUh so S&T is the token that was launched uh in the original ICO from uh Status Network a long time ago.\nUm and it has been a utility utility token so far mostly in the app in and in the wallet but now we actually bringing it back and giving it way more weight into the way the network operates.\nUm, and so if you stake S&T, you will get karma.\nAnd and why it's not just a little token game, right?\nWhy is it so important?\nBecause karma because it's non-transferable is the way we make sure that there is no spam on the network.\nAnd we need to have some economic security or some economic value backing the minting of karma.\nUm otherwise karma has no value and we can just mint an infinite number and and and then like it's actually not protecting the network.\nSo by grounding the minting of karma based on an economic staking of liquid tokens then we make sure that it has actually has a lot of value.\nUm so that's the first way to get karma.\nSecond way to get karma is to bridge yield bearing assets.\nSo ETH or stable coin.\nUm to the network and deposit it as liquidity uh or as staking or as like productive way within the network.\nUh so that's the second way and the third way is to use apps.\nSo for those who have done the blast era uh um and that have tried around the the blast ecosystem the to my from my point of view that was something that worked very well is the gold experiment where each app on blast had some gold that they could keep for themselves and distribute to their users.\nAnd so it's going to be the same for karma.\nUm each app that builds on Status Network and that kind of gets approved by our team um and initially it will be kind of a somewhat centralized uh way to do it.\nSo we just get in touch with our team we we kind of vets you we make sure that it's all good and then you can get access to that.\nUm but in the future that process should be decentralized that that's the goal.\nUm so each app will have um some balance of karma that they will be able to keep at 50% for themselves and they will need to distribute 50% for their users.\nAnd so by using apps you will be able to acrew karma and actually your first karma so the first unit like the first coin you will get in your in your token in your wallets to be able to use the network for free will come from apps.\nUm and so this is where the the whole interest of karma comes in right you have one way is to secure the network from a security like from a economic security point of view.\nThe second is providing productive liquidity to the chain and third is actually using the chain and using the apps that are on the chain.\nSo anyone can get karma.\nYou don't need to make an investment of up front and because again the chain is gasless technically you don't even need to bridge uh that's the the kind of what we want to get to is to have the easiest onboarding for NL2 u that you can find where with a fresh wallet like you create a fresh new preview wallet with your uh Gmail account you still be able to transact on chain get rewards cards and probably at some point get liquid tokens and this is like the start of your uh onchain journey.\nThat's what we want to be able to achieve.\nAnd um I'm wondering you know like for those who are interested um in Karma are there like any caps or limits on how much funding a single project can receive or you know um could a really compelling app in theory get support indefinitely?\nThat's that's a a good question on this is something that we have uh modeled and we have uh thought a lot about mostly because we don't want for example some whales to come in and and like take all the yields from the L2 but the reality is that because karma is distributed with uh S&T liquidity providing and activity um a well will not be able to do all things at once.\nUh they will be able to kind of focus on like where they can get the most karma but they will never get like activity karma for example that that's going to be very hard for them because they will need to to use games and they will need to like spend time on the network.\nUm so so first of all because we have that kind of diversity of sources of karma um that's a bit anti anti.\nSecond point is we are working with a bunch of organizations at the moment.\nUm so uh I can't say who but they're like very deep into public funding into the ether ecosystem and so on.\nSo you will have some more news uh coming soon.\nUm where those organizations will also get some karma initially so that they can vote for projects that are not uh I would say capital efficient meaning um as a user uh who wants to have some return on your karma for example you'll probably not vote for those open source project and like public good infrastructure that will not give you a token back um and so we want to make sure that those builders also get a chance to receive funding.\nAnd so we are we want to have organizations that are kind of specialized in giving out those uh those funding rounds to protocols and open source uh projects um that are not tokenized uh but that are still providing a lot of value to the community.\nNow let's take an example.\nUm let's say someone from our audience is working on a project and you know like it gets funded but later on um this project is underdelivers or you know it goes inactive what happens then um can karma voters reverse or you know like can they adjust funding decisions if things don't go as planned?\nIt's uh yeah that that's really good because uh that's a long conversation that we had with different partners in the space that again have specialized in public funding.\nUm and and this is true.\nThis is a big issue, right?\nUm and and Gitcoin had a lot of issues with that.\nThe Nons project also had a lot of issues with that where you would see a project that looks very cool on the outside with like a lot of collaborators and like a very good like mission and vision and so on and then suddenly they just like disappear.\nThey just did their Twitter accounts and they go away with their tokens and that's it.\nSo we are looking at different ways to do it.\nUm first uh we're going to have a lot of epochs.\nSo, it's not like one big funding round and then that's it and we just leave you with a few hundred thousand dollars and you do whatever you want.\nIt's going to be kind of a a more constant approach of those epochs where you will have like multiple voting rounds um every like at the moment we are like looking at like every month or every two months.\nUm so the goal being that yes you can come and you can probably get some rewards once but if you just leave the project or you just don't do anything for until the next end of the epoch then probably you will not get funding anymore.\nSo that's one one solution.\nUm the second solution is we have been working a lot with uh super fluid um to enable streamable um public funding.\nMeaning instead of just giving a lump sum to someone and be like do whatever you want with it, we can put a stream of money um because this is what they do.\nThis is what Super Freed is about.\nThey create streams of money uh that you just stream to the project and you can put some conditions around it and if for example certain milestones are not met or like certain activity is not met or certain activ or whatever like the criteria that you have then you can just stop the stream um and and basically get back the funding to the the main public funding pool.\nUm so yeah, we're definitely conscious of those abuse and we just want to make sure that we build a consistent approach to it.\nUh that works well for very small projects uh that might want to have a chance of of getting funded as well as as for larger bigger projects that may need to have kind of a continuous or at least at the beginning continuous funding.\nUm and maybe like just have like one question on this.\nUm are there like any other uses for karma beyond you know like governance?\nUm we talk a lot about governance and also like funding votes.\nUm will it play like you know a bigger role in the network over time?\nYeah.\nSo um gless transactions g throughput is obviously like the main uh I mean it's it's the reason why it's non transferable initially just to make sure that it it acts kind of as a a credit score if you want like the higher your credit score the more we can basically give you more um more transactions for free and it acts as kind of loyalty um program because people go with high karma will be basically the people every protocol will be after.\nUh if you have a high camera, it means that either you've done a lot of onchain activity or that you have provided a lot of liquidity or that you have staked a lot of S&T.\nIn any case, you are you as a as an account or as a person you are actually a very good target for a lot of protocols that want to attract you as a user.\nUm so it has uh an interest in uh targeting um in um loyalty and making sure that people come back uh in stickiness of course um and most importantly and I think that like there's two thing here I mentioned credit score um there are some protocols right now uh that are starting to do uncol underateralized uh credit so wildcat for example is is a good one um but it's it's a very different approach are they are very curing to institutions and professionals.\nUm but we think that if you have a very high karma score because that can't be faked uh you can't again you can't buy it so you you can't fake it.\nUm then there is a chance that at some point we will be able to have under collateralized uh loans uh probably like small loans um for for users with high karma score.\nThat's one like use case I'm super excited about.\nAnother very cool use case um is um on the on the fact that again it's you can't buy it but it has a lot of voting power.\nUm so probably uh if you have a lot of karma but you don't want to be like you know doing all the governance thing and vote and like project selection and so on you can basically delegate your vote and of course you can get paid for that uh because your vote has value because there's like actual yield behind your vote.\nUm and so one project that we would love to see happening on the on the chain as soon as we have a mainet is um a lending protocol for the karma.\nUm and so if you have karma in your wallet that just sits there you can and you don't want to be uh actively looking at the governance aspect you can just delegate it and whoever pays you the most gets your karma and is able to vote with it.\nCool.\nUm I just want to go back a little bit to you know what um makes Status Network really um set apart.\nUm we talk about you know like your approach that um Status Network really is focusing on founding builders long term and um one of the big promises here is that um the apps built on stages don't just launch you know like they get real um ongoing support um which is like a big contrast to what we usually see in web3 um and I want to ask you like when it comes to the types of project that apply what are you expecting to um see the most of are we talking about um core infrastructure game, social apps, defy tools or maybe something else.\nYeah.\nUm so you mentioned most of them.\nUm the the first use case that we see uh with what we think is going to be the strongest appeal is gates and the main reason is the fact that the network is gasless.\nUm so you we basically did a a quick demo of that in our leather stone hall.\nUh you can find it in on on YouTube if you want.\nUm where you can basically go to actually I can just give you the the the URL.\nYou can just go to ponzi hero.xyz.\nUh you click on connect wallet and you can connect with a fresh wallet.\nSo nothing, right?\nJust like create a new wallet in MetaMask.\nUm we you don't bridge anything.\nYou just add Status Network as a uh as a custom network.\nUm, and you can click through it and earns an NFT, earn some token just by clicking on the button.\nUm, every time uh the Metam mask is going to pop out, uh, you're going to approve.\nBut because gas fees are at zero, so both the base gas fees and the priority gas fees, then suddenly you don't need to have a balance of anything in your in your wallet to actually get started on chain.\nAnd so we think that for games that's a big unlock because up until now the way games were doing it is either you first need to fund your wallets before being able to do anything or games needed to have uh pay master accounts where they would just uh subsidize transaction and gas fees for users and that's a big risk for them because they can get drained right so instead of doing it we basically do it as the chain novel where if your app has enough karma.\nUm, and if you do like a nice little onboarding for your users and they get their first karma, then suddenly they're able to transact for free on chain.\nUm, and so games are definitely like the first kind of target that we that we see.\nUm, and more specifically like casual gaming, mobile gaming, uh, like in message gaming like kind of the Telegram games and so on.\nThis is kind of the target that we have.\nUm, that's kind of the first main use case we see.\nSecond one is uh you mentioned it as well is social apps.\nUm the same you don't want to be paying gas every time you do a like or a reshare or post or anything but at the same time if you want to create like a sufficiently decentralized uh social network if you want to like mint NFTs to your users if you want to allow them to uh to send um some tokens to each other u then you still need to have gas fees or at least the concept of it somewhere um here you can abstract it completely and just focus on the core mechanics and third and I think we are still exploring that division that that vertical is defy infrastructure.\nUm fortify infrastructure gas fees have been somewhat an issue but since they went like closer to zero um they have\n\n\nBeen kind of set aside, but there's still a problem with like heavy or intensive defined apps. Um, so there's a lot of talks about like CLOBs, for example, on Twitter recently. Uh, this is not exactly what we're after because we will need to have like extremely low latency, and this is not our main focus at the moment, um, even if we might get there at some point. This is not the main focus. Um, but for example, for per trading, for like gasless dex, um, all these kind of like small apps that we want to provide for free to users so that they can discover DeFi without any need to, \"Oh, first I need to bridge ETH. What is ETH? Where do I get it? How do I bridge?\" And so on and so on. If you receive some tokens from a game that you just played and you want to like swap it to something, or you receive an NFT, \"Oh, it's a rare NFT,\" you want to sell it on the marketplace. How do you like sell it on the marketplace if you don't have like gas fees to pay for the listing? Um, so this is like all the type of interactions that we want to simplify, um, so that the onboarding gets way easier for, uh, for people into crypto.\n\nOkay. Um, and you know, like we have talked a lot about karma as a reputation and governance layer, um, which is, you know, like a good way to reward meaningful contribution and influence. But Status Network, um, also has a core token SNT, right? Um, which powers a different set of mechanism in the ecosystem. Can you tell us more about that, like what kind of features, tools, or right does, um, holding SNT unlock for users?\n\nYeah. So the the main use case of SNT, um, is really going to be securing the spam protection, uh, from the economic standpoint. Um, so if karma was very easy to get, um, and if there was no actual security or like economic security backing it, um, then the spam protection would not work. Uh, you need to have some friction, um, for users to acquire a lot of karma if they want to have a lot of free transactions on the network. And so SNT, uh, because it's liquid, because it's available on chain and on centralized exchanges, um, you can buy it to make sure that, uh, you will participate into the security of the network. And for providing security to the network, we basically give you, uh, two things. First, uh, we give you karma. Um, so you increase your, uh, governance power, but you also increase your gasless throughput on the network. And second, um, we are now exploring to have a system where if you, uh, are launching an app on the network and you want to do an airdrop, for example, then, uh, karma will be a good way to know who to airdrop to. And because, uh, in the current setup, 35% of karma minting is going to come from SNT staking, then, um, having SNT in your wallet and being able to stake it will already give you, uh, exposure to those, um, to those airdrops and future airdrops. And so there's kind of a a whole way to see it, uh, where you can have a very passive exposure to the network where you just stick and you do nothing. Um, and and this is also a way that we want to allow people to do. So, for example, I'm I'm kind of somewhat a DJ, right? I'm I'm just like trying out all the different apps, all the different chains, and so on. I bridge everywhere. I have like hundreds of wallets. Um, and and but I'm like kind of a very small subset of user. Most of the user, they will have one or two wallets. They will not necessarily think about bridging and so on. Um, and if they do, maybe they're not gamers or maybe they don't they're not into social apps or maybe they're not into DeFi, but they might still want to kind of get access to a network and get exposure to that network. And so basically, uh, getting SNT and staking it will be the most passive way to get upside from the network because it will expose you to a basket of assets that are native to the network.\n\nUm, you can see it, I think, as kind of an index, right? It's kind of an index of like the future value of of all the onchain activities that are that is going to happen on the network.\n\nAnd, um, we have seen like, you know, um, how your public funding model creates a more sustainable community-driven alternative to short-term grants. And you know, like even give builders a way to stay independent. Looking ahead, do you see this kind of model eventually replacing VC funding in Web3 altogether, or do you think, you know, it's more like a complimentary system that works alongside it? Um, I love to have your take on this and you know, like where this is all heading.\n\nYeah. So it's it's funny because I've been flip-flopping on VCs for a long time. So in a in a previous life, I was an entrepreneur. I, um, I did like three, four different projects in different countries working with a bunch of different VCs. I raised like multiple millions in in funding from different VCs, and I always had like a like love-hate relationship with them, uh, because thanks for funding my, uh, my venture, but at the same time, um, I don't really like like the power dynamics between us, and I feel that I'm doing all the work and you're just like providing capital that is not even yours, that just like borrowing from like, uh, your your own LPs. Um, and so yeah, I I had like that weird relationship. And and so at some point I was like, \"Yeah, this is shouldn't exist. We should have like other ways of funding projects and so on.\" The reality is that it's as you mentioned, it's complimentary. Um, and and why? It's because communities that are going through a funding round, yes, they may want to fund a project that is a bit different or that has a higher risk profile. Um, but they will probably not commit the whole house in that project versus this is this is their unique business model is that they need to take a shot at unconventional stuff or like risky stuff to make sure that actually provide a superior return to their LPS. And so, um, now I' and and this is actually something that we've already started as a network. We already started to work, uh, with different VCs and different incubators and accelerators, mostly for that reason is yes, we can provide public funding, but for a specific subset of projects or for projects that are more risky or that are maybe not exactly in the type of, uh, candidates for funding that we might have on the network. We want to have a network of, uh, of VCs and investors and and help for the startups and for the projects that come to our chain that we can basically forward the deal flow to. Um, and so if you're a VC investor or like, um, incubator accelerator working in the space, uh, feel free to reach out because we are definitely looking for, uh, partnerships there where we know that we will, we already started to have like very competent funders coming at us. Um, and we want to basically funnel that pipeline through different ways of getting funding. Um, one is of course on the network, uh, getting vote voted on chain from the public funding pool, but another one is getting funded by VCs or or other type of, uh, venture investments.\n\nOkay. And maybe like for my last question, um, um, I was, you know, wondering, like, you know, do you have any current or upcoming events or campaigns that's maybe interesting for our audience? Can you share a little bit with us? Oh yeah.\n\nSo we have a lot of stuff coming up. Um, so first of all, Status app. Uh, so the the Status wallet just launched their first, um, campaign. Um, it's fairly basic, uh, which is just getting people started to, uh, reconnect with the brand. So I would definitely advise you to get there. There might be some karma for you in the end. Um, so yeah, go go check it out. It's pretty simple. You just need to like follow us on Twitter and and a bunch of things like that. But that will maybe be a way for you to get your first karma. Um, and this is live now, right? So you should go. Second, um, we are so this live stream is actually the first time we kind of more publicly talk about everything we're building. Uh, so thank you for that by the way. Um, um, but, um, in the future, we're going to make a lot of more, uh, announcements and, uh, we're also going to publish way more our research and everything we've been building behind the scenes for the last year or so. Um, something very interesting that is going to come up with Linear. Um, so I didn't mention that at the beginning, uh, but Status Network is built on the Linear stack. Uh, the Linear stack, you can basically see it as a competitor to the OP stack. Um, it's a ZKVM rollup stack, um, that we are collaborating with the Lina team on to build more features for them. So one of the feature is the gasless module. So being able to make Lina fully gasless if they want to. Um, another one is the yield bearing bridge. So being able to bridge yield bearing assets and and found a network with that. Um, another one is ALDA. So we're in touch with different DAOs to basically have a way for us to post blobs to those DAOs instead of to to the EML one. Um, so yeah, we're heavily collaborating with the Linear ecosystem, and, uh, the Linear ecosystem is going to have very good news to announce in the coming weeks. Uh, I can't say that I'm not allowed to, but you should really check out what's going to come out of that ecosystem. And I'm talking about ecosystem, right? Because, um, you can see Lina as a chain, uh, which it has been so far. But with the upcoming announcements that they're going to make, you're going to understand that, um, Lina is not just a chain, it's a way larger ecosystem, uh, with a lot of OG's organization that are building, uh, in that, um, in that ecosystem. And you can look at ENS. So ENS is also going to launch a Linear-based, uh, L2. Um, we are using it, and you'll know that a bunch of other big names are also going to start, uh, announcing stuff. So I would definitely look at that during the month of July. That would be a kind of, yeah, good moment. Um, and, um, and then for us in October, we will start our, uh, TVL predeposits campaign. So, how does that work? We'll have three vaults on the L1, uh, an ETH vault, a stable coin vault, and SNT vault. And users are basically able to deposit, um, any of those, uh, tokens into those vaults. All the yield generated by those vaults will basically kickstart the entire public funding, um, uh, flywheel. It will fund the initial liquidity incentives, uh, for the for the DEX. It will also fund the operation of the of the L2. And then so that's in October. Uh, hopefully that that there will be up for like three, four months maximum, and then Q1 2026 is the moment we launch the mainnet. Um, and so at this moment, the first karma will be dropped. Um, all the, uh, TVL that is pre-predeposited into the L1 vault will get bridged to the L2. Uh, users will be able to decide where to allocate those funds, and, um, and of course, the L2 will be fully gasless at this point at this point. Um, talking about gaslessness, um, currently, as I mentioned, um, Status Network testnet is fully gasless, but we don't have a spam protection in place, so please don't break our little network for now, but if you want to try it out, please go. It's pretty very easy. Everything is in the docs. Um, as I mentioned, you can go to ponzero.xyz also to just have a taste of what a gasless L2 looks like. Um, and, um, but starting in October, we will actually launch the fully gasless network, meaning with the spam protection in place. Uh, and this is the moment where we will basically test out all the type of attack vectors and spam that that can happen on the chain, and we'll make sure that the design is is, uh, stable and that will be ready to, uh, to receive on mainnet.\n\nI love that, a lot of like amazing upcoming events and you know, like products. I'm really excited for you guys. Um, before we wrap up, I just would like to take a few questions from our audience. The first one will be like any special wallet to access status.\n\nAny special wallet? Yeah. Yeah. So, um, actually in the latest version of Status, uh, Status Network testnet is available. So you can already connect, uh, using it. Uh, so that's we were pretty happy with that. Uh, but then it's just another network. So, as long as you can have, um, custom networks on your wallet, you can basically, uh, trade out there. Everyone shits on MetaMask. Yeah, okay, I get it. But I've been using it for what, 10 years now, and it works. I mean, it's just like it just works. So, not 10 years, eight. Yeah, eight years. Um, so it works. So, I'm I'm like, yeah, people don't like that choice, but I actually like MetaMask. It's okay. Um, um, Arabi is not bad either. Um,\n\nmy little favorite to be honest is Rainbow, but I just love the colors. I love the the the UX, and I love the team too. So yeah, I actually love them. But, um, but yeah, um, anywhere that gets you custom networks, uh, will work. So for example, Rainbow sadly doesn't accept custom network. Rainbow, please add Status Network. Yay. Um, yeah.\n\nOkay. And I have another one here, and we'll wrap up after this one. Any restrictions on what types of apps can apply for funding?\n\nNo, not at the moment. Um, the the goal is to be as large as possible in terms of what we accept. As I mentioned, um, it's apps funding, but in reality, it's it's going to come down to a single address that you post. Um, and that address can have an EOA behind, it can have a multisig, it can have a a pair like a contract, literally anything will work. Um, so we will accept like a very large amount of apps for funding. Um, we might need to do some restriction for like if we see obviously like scammy thing or spammy things or like just fraud or whatever, of course that that will not pass. Uh, but yeah, our goal is not to provide, uh, very stringent rules around that.\n\nAll right, amazing. So that was like my last question. Could you please tell, um, us how our audience can keep up with updates on Status Network and if they are interested and how can they contact your team?\n\nAwesome. So the easiest way to be honest is to interact with us on Twitter. Um, I'm I'm spending my life here, so I will be pretty fast to answer you. So either follow me, zeroxip, or follow the Status Network accounts. It's at statist. Um, you can also engage with the people at if Status, but, uh, we have different teams, right? So we will not get the same type of answers from us from them. Um, if you're a builder, come to our Telegram group. Um, if you want to build with us, you will easily find the link. Um, I actually think it's Telegram, like t.me/study2.\n\n\nIf I'm not mistaken.\nUm, so you can join us there.\nUm, and then, um, yeah, post like PR to our docs if you have questions.\nUm, we are like fairly early in terms of like we're a small team, right, and we want to build very fast.\nUm, so we're definitely open to any criticism, any feedback, any uh product requests that you have, uh, any feature that we you want to see happening on the network.\nPlease get in touch with us.\nUh, we'll be super happy to to on board you and to help you with that.\nAnd, um, yeah, um, it's, uh, you can send us emails also, but we we don't really look at it.\nSo, who is using emails anyway?\nAnyway, thank you so much um for joining us today.\nI was really happy to to have you uh on our AMA live show.\nReally really appreciate all the insight you have shared with us and we would really love to have you back on the show in the future and of course thank you so much to all of our listeners for being here with us.\nWe truly appreciate your time and attention.\nI hope to see you um to the next Cointelegraph show.\nYou can always join us on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, our website and podcast and you can just search for Cointelegraph.\nThank you so much and have a good day or have a good night.\nBye.\nAll right.\nThank you.\nBye.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
