  "cleanText": "Wasn't the last conversation that we're having of day one.\nUh, it's been a fantastic day here in Paris.\nUh, COINTELEGRAPH is obviously doing a live stream in partnership with Proof of Talk, and I'm now joined by Eowyn Chen from Trust Wallet.\nAowen, it's great to chat to you again.\nUm, I've had the pleasure quite a few times in my career.\nUm, first of all, how are you enjoying Paris?\nHow are you enjoying the event?\nOh, I love Paris.\nI think it's beautiful weather, beautiful environment, and then people are intellectually curious.\nI'm having one of the highest intellectual conversations around here.\nSo that's great.\nYeah, look, uh, I I genuinely mean this.\nWhen I first came to Proof of Talk last year, I was very presently surprised because it was an event that kind of came out of nowhere and had a fantastic lineup of speakers and really good access to people.\nSo, it's been great for me so far.\nWe're looking forward to having a lot more really engaging conversations.\nIf you are just joining us on the live stream, please do go ahead and drop your uh questions and comments for Aowen.\nWe'll try and pose some of these questions to her as the live stream goes along.\nBut feel free if you want to ask about Trust Wallet, if you want to ask about stable coins, if you want to ask about self custody versus custody and exchanges, have at it.\nUm, I think told that this is a hy, so yeah.\nWell, there we go.\nUh, I Yeah, I I never ask too hard questions, so we we'll keep it relaxed.\nUm, Aowen, maybe we can just chat about uh the landscape in the US.\nA lot has changed there.\nI was in uh the United States for Bitcoin 2025.\nUh, it was really interesting to see um the amount of politicians and big mainstream institutions present at that event and uh conversely the amount of conversations that were happening at a Bitcoin conference about stable coins.\nSo let's talk about stable coins.\nI think it's one of the biggest narratives in the industry right now.\nBitcoin still commands a massive market cap, but if you look at something like Tether, it's a $150 billion market cap.\nCircle just went public last week, which I think was a a really fantastic milestone for the industry and really signaling that uh traditional finance and and financial institutions are interested in figuring out a better way of moving money around the world and it seems like CBDC's are gone and stable coins are here to stay.\nWhat are your general thoughts on on the stable coin landscape?\nI think stablecoin is undoubtedly one of the tokens or one of the few tokens that find product market fit right viral product market fit.\nUm, I think it has a lot to do in the historical context too when the treasury bills um uh interest rate are increasing uh starting from the covid time and or after the covid times and then it also solves one of the biggest problem within the industry about fluctuation and I think right now it becomes the most important uh bridge between crypto and trifi with so many traffic interests coming onto the crypto space.\nI I do believe that stable coin is the cornerstone for a lot of the traffic opportunities to further go on chain.\nWithout stablecoin will be a lot harder.\nUm, so I'm very bullish on stable coin and I think it's also politically at this moment that it gets the aha awakening moment uh outside of the crypto space to realize how important stable coin can be opportunity for them.\nSo it further fuels the institutional momentum coming in.\nSo I think that's fantastic.\nBut on the other side, people talk a lot about institutional opportunity.\nI get to see a lot of retail opportunity.\nAnd I I love doing retail businesses is because we get to see the pain points of the world earlier and faster.\nUm, stablecoin got first adopted be besides trading is also because of the um the disadvantage of the world needs a better assets to hedge their uh fiat uh when it's coming down to the really terrible inflation moments.\nUm, so it's actually where the debanked where the disadvantage are getting the stable coin into everybody people's hands a lot more.\nUm, and um the data that I was seeing in last year September is that it was already a bull market but there were about $10 billion worth of USDT not moving for six months.\nWhat does that mean?\nIt means that people coming down to crypto not because of the spec speculative reasons.\nYeah.\nUm, they're not even thinking about whatever yields because it's not even moving.\nIt's just because people wanted to hold US dollar assets and then crypto provides this global access network that traditionally uh retail people or disadvantaged people deepbacked people cannot have access to and I think that's actually a very meaningful impact that stable coin had earlier even before all this political movement uh and realizations too um and that's that leads us to develop that product features uh to give users a earning opport opportunity besides holding stable coin.\nYeah.\nUm, so we launched the stable coin earn that people can just deposit USDT, USDC, um USDA into the major chains and then earn four to six% of the yield without any lock up period of time.\nOkay.\nAnd I think this is a much more fantastic way to provide micro savings account banking services.\nYeah.\nFor the people that otherwise would not be able to afford the bank accounts.\nUh, in many of the countries.\nUm, and then the adoption is also quite good.\nUm, it's as expected the adoption mostly come from retail.\nMhm.\nU not the major wells that you will imagine from the institutions.\nUh, and in one day uh in four weeks it passes 30 million.\nYeah.\nAnd then this is accumulation of $50, $100, $200 those kind of a checks.\nYeah.\nAnd that's what I find the adoptions and the impact that crypto can have in people's life is heartwarming.\nYeah, exactly.\nI mean, I've I've had many conversations with Paulo Arduino from from Tether and uh he often talks about USDT not being important for Americans or Europeans, but for the rest of the world, developing countries, you know, countries that are facing hyperinflation and that sort of thing.\nThey're looking to the US dollar and a few other harder currencies.\nThey're all fiat currencies, but they're still a better store of value than their local currency.\nAnd finally, we have infrastructure rails that allow them to do that.\nAnd that is why you're seeing this.\nMy my second question to you is, you mentioned the stable coin earn product.\nWhere do you get the yield from?\nAnd and how do you do that?\nAnd also how how important has legislation like the Genius Act in America been in allowing stable coins to reach you know their their ultimate sort of use case which is payments and then storing value and earning some some interest on on saving your money.\nYeah, I think the stable coin yield is always an interesting question where the yield comes from.\nSo far we use a completely decentralized way to plug into the uh DeFi protocol yields.\nUm, but those are very good partners that we work with that truly holds up the security and the compliance standards.\nAve and the likes or a few other players.\nYes Moro, a uh compounds.\nYeah, they're all kind of the ones that already survive the the ups and downs of the markets and figure out the sustainable path to it.\nUm, but I know that there are lots of other opportunity to potentially plug in offchain yield uh that potentially can allow this stable coin to be able to power real economy.\nUm, there are a lot of teams that I'm know that are kind of building things around it, but we will wait for them to mature a little bit more so that they can plug into the systems.\nWith regards to the regulations, I think stablecoin is definitely one of the product that you want to have regulatory clarity to be able to unlock and connect to more payment channels opportunities into the real life for people.\nUh in this conferences there are lots of conversations around the payments and then be able to build on top of the stable coin and then only stable coin as the cornerstone gets the regulatory clarity.\nThen there are more traffic product on top of it.\nUh that can feel not shaky, right?\nLike for for the fundamental realize on the stable coin that they have to be anchored on.\nUm so I think this is pretty bullish.\nUh and to be honest, US dollar uh besides US dollar, I guess it's euro are probably going to be the top two currency fiat currency assets that stable coin format will be adopted the most.\nSo, it's good to see the US government leading in the way uh and uh uh setting the setting the tone so that hopefully Europe can follow.\nYeah, I hope so, too.\nUm I think one of the big sort of topics that I've been exploring of late is, you know, self-custody versus custody solutions.\nYou've got big centralized exchanges.\nA lot of people just leave a lot of value on exchanges and for the most part, you should be fine, right?\nThere's a there's a lot of protections in place that are that are pretty decent, but at the same time, bad things happen.\nYou look no further than the Bybit hack earlier this year.\nSocial engineering, their their systems get compromised and they drain $1.4 billion from an Ethereum hot wallet.\nThat's one of the biggest exchanges.\nIt's just a stark reminder.\nIf you keep if you trust your coins to someone else, you are trusting them to look after your money.\nIt's the same thing as you put it in a bank account.\nIf there's a run on the banks and and they're not managing their deposits properly, there's a risk.\nThis is why things like Trust Wallet exist, right?\nYes.\nMaybe you can just talk a little bit more about your philosophy on self custody, what the difficulties still are.\nThere's a lot of responsibility on the user and what the trade-offs are of that and why you think that most people should use something like Trust Wallet over something else.\nYeah, one of our mission is to provide people the freedom to own and the freedom to access opportunities which is what we believe as the fundamental value proposition that why we come into the space and I think freedom to own is so important philosophically because as we age we start to rely on so many intermediary that we even lose the capabilities or use the confidence that you truly own something like looking at your fiat dollars on the bank account right like how do you really make sure that that's your bank account?\nWhat if someone made a database problems and then you can get wiped out and and I guess that those are the points where you don't have confidence that you truly own it.\nHence you in you you introduce regulations monitories to be able to hold accountability uh on the ones that can control it.\nBut who knows whether there is black black swan event and that's why I think self- custody is very important is because people should always have the option that they can own it themselves.\nYeah.\nSometimes with a given my American background I use the analogy as the US's second amendments which is the rights to own a gun.\nI know that it's not very common for the rest of the world to have this opportunity but the reason why it is such an important fundamental constitutional rights in the US is because that yes you're not going to use your gun every day as a convenience for you to guard your security.\nYou will trust the police.\nYou will trust the army to provide the security as a service and the infrastructure.\nBut what if one day you're in this countryside, you need to guard your own safety.\nYou got to have your means to say, I can own it.\nI can protect myself.\nAnd I think it's the same thing with self- custody.\nI will be very honest.\nI don't think self- custody is for everybody in all situations at all times.\nYeah, it's always a very important to find a combination of the custody solutions in the specific context for security, but it's very important for everybody to learn the skill set to a be able to know how to protect themselves and have the self- custody and that's what we do.\nBut beyond that, what we can do better as an industry is to advance in technology and give people easier ways to do self- custody.\nAnd that's what I believe in the one or two years we will solve significant problem with the easy to use recovery problem and self- custody together.\nUm, I've got a couple of questions coming through on the live stream and please do keep your questions coming through if you have some burning questions for Aowen.\nThe first one, this is this is pretty pretty spicy.\nUm, how much user data do you actually collect despite the claims that you make?\nI think it's quite an interesting question especially from user data if you as a self-custodial solution we don't collect user IP even okay um so there's not much user data except for some cohorts data let's say I would track users conversion rate from clicking this button to the next button if they're from the first week of March what's the conversion rate those are the data that we track because it fundamentally help us to improve our product and services and doesn't identify users personal information.\nThis is a principle for us is that we do we hold the ISO certificate for privacy and then we're also operationally liable to make sure that uh we can be a light uh in the industry so to hold up to the privacy standards.\nThere's another one coming through here and this is an existential one I think for the entire space from Steve um allow if Apple wallet came out tomorrow would you survive and I think that question goes for everyone in the industry.\nYeah, I think if Apple wallet become a well self-custody wallet just like Telegram wallet.\nI think we already see this kind of examples coming in, you will probably be a pretty big competitors but at the same time they will set the bar so high that for us to find unique value proposition that we have to offer.\nUm I don't think the space is one person eats it all because there are always a unique person's needs and there's always some kind of fundamental principle that Apple can do or cannot do that other companies or the product teams can make the decision for themselves.\nSo it would definitely be a pressure but it will just pressure us to do product experiences way better and find a unique value proposition better to serve the users's needs.\nUm, so it will be nerve-wracking, but I think it's better for everybody.\nWhat are what are some of the biggest competitors in terms of self-custodial wallets that you look at today?\nBecause I'm sure you guys do a lot of competitor analysis and what what sets everyone apart from each other.\nIs there even a way to set each other apart?\nI think it's like the common names that people already know, right?\nThe MetaMask, the Phantoms, Coinbase wallet, etc.\nI think everybody have their own take even though the product looks very similar.\nFor us, simplicity is the most important thing because crypto is hard enough.\nYeah.\nSo the key product design and technological design principle for us is always how do we simplify things assuming people don't have the knowledge.\nBut there's also caveat.\nSo for example, we don't want to sacrifice self- custody.\nYeah.\nUh and we don't want to sacrifice for privacy or security.\nSo\n\n\nThere's always a balance between how to uphold the most simple, easy to use while not sacrificing self-cost security and privacy.\nWe spoke about some risks off Mike.\nUm, one of them is, you know, this this general theme of AI becoming ubiquitous across industries, right?\nYeah.\nYou have some interesting thoughts on the risks that AI could pose to wallets.\nI mean, there's a lot of talk about people just using AI agents to manage wallets, to manage token payments, XYZ trading, whatever you want to do, um, you know, uh, token swaps between different chains.\nWhat's your general view on AI, and do you believe it could pose a risk to your business and your users?\nYeah, a part of me really thinks that when we're building blockchain and crypto, we're building the financial infrastructure or the future of the economic infrastructure for AI primarily, and then the second is probably for human.\nBut when it comes down to the risk of AI, it's always about who's in control.\nYeah.\nRight.\nUm, like how much people are willing to give the authority and delegation to AI is the same question as if how much people want to delegate custody to custodians, right?\nSo it's the same problem, same old problem that humans we have to make decisions for ourselves.\nI don't think it's anything new, but I see a lot more opportunity for AI is that with the unlimited abundance of intelligence, I do think AI will probably execute and strategize better.\nYeah.\nThan human.\nYeah.\nSo it's more about how do humans manage your team of AI agents to do the work for you, then what does it mean for wallet?\nThis is what I tell the team is that people can build the blockchain for AI.\nPeople can build the payment uh kind of APIs for AI, but we want to represent human.\nWe want to make sure as a UI wallet, how do I empower humans to thrive in the world of AIS, and maybe wallet, our wallet will become a final AI agent, but knows the users so intimately well, and then uh this trust AI will represent users to connect to your swap AI, your AI, your payment AI, or anybody research AI, whatever it is, right, for the benefits ultimately for the users.\nThat's what I feel probably will likely happen in this agentic AI network uh of what futures might be, but we will stay true to where we provide value is the UI empowerment layer for human.\nUh, my final question to you, we we briefly touched on real world asset tokenization.\nUm, I look at, you know, uh, Bitcoin treasury companies like, you know, strategy, made a planet, all of these new stock offerings like tokenized securities is probably the best use case for for our RWA to take tradi to, you know, the next level and just trade 24/7.\nUm, how do you go about integrating that?\nAnd do you think that it's sort of the missing link in the puzzle and a lot of self-custodial wallets will be able to will allow people to just hold tokenized securities and manage their assets and own them themselves?\nYeah.\nHow I see this is that if the vision is to make blockchain and crypto the future of the economic and financial infra, then you wanted to make as many assets as accessible on this infrastructure and what it is access for people to uh get access and manage uh for the different assets options.\nSo fundamentally, I don't see any difference with a tokenized security or tokenized meme or tokenize anything from the users perspective.\nYeah.\nSo we just need to be the gateway and the door and the technological providers to facilitate users to be able to access and manage according to their own desire.\nUh, there are a lot of infra providers we know are trying to make this kind of things happen, like you do you do need a tokenized layer, you need the compliance layer, and then you need to find the right chain, you need to find the light liquidity pools.\nUm, those are all existing I think infra layer that we can just like modules and logos and build them up together with wallets, ultimately just need to open the doors for the users to make the choices.\nSo, um, if we put this into the Lego and modular framework, then uh RWA or any kind of tokenized assets is just like another crypto assets.\nYeah, for sure.\nEowyn Chen, thank you so much for your time.\nThank you for watching at home wherever you are around the world.\nThis is the live stream of the proof of work uh work conference uh proof of talk conference.\nSorry, my brain is leaving me very late in the day right here in Paris.\nWe will be back in the hot seat.\nYeah, I am in the hot seat.\nI I I don't even know how to speak anymore.\nBut yeah, please do join us again tomorrow if you enjoyed this conversation.\nLike and retweet the space if you've been watching on X.\nAnd of course, give us a like and a subscribe on YouTube if you're watching us there.\nKeep the comments coming through and be sure to tune in tomorrow as we bring you loads of interviews and a live stream from the event here in Paris.\nThank you very much for joining us.\n[Music]\n",
