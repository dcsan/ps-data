You have free\nwill. But it's good to see you again,\nman, and in very different\ncircumstances. I don't want to talk too\nmuch about Solana, but I've never asked\nyou since you left. Tell us the story\nwhy you left Solana and what your\ngeneral experience was there and the\nstory behind that. Yeah, well\nthanks for having me. I mean I was with\nSolana for four years. When I joined,\nthere were, I think, 30 daily active\nprograms on the network, and no one\nreally knew what Solana was. It was very\nmuch an underdog. And then, you know,\nyou fast forward four years later, and\nthe network is one of the most dominant\nnetworks out there. It is the highest\nrevenue generation network in crypto. It's\nin an incredible place. But I\nkind of always had a little bit of that\nitch to go be a founder, and at the same\ntime, I really didn't want to go build\nsomething that was competitive with\nSolana or build something that was on\ntop of Solana, right? It was really\nlike a challenge to think of what are\nthe types of applications you can build\nthat will really move crypto forwards a\ndecade and two years. How do we really\nget into this place?\nWe've talked about mainstream adoption\nand taking on TradFi forever, but the\nfundamental core infrastructure isn't\nthere. And so the real moment for me to\nsay Double Zero is worth building and\nthere's a market here that's worth\naddressing was working on the Fire\nDancer project and seeing the fact that\nwe had engineers working on this project\nthat could build a validator client that\ncould do a million transactions per\nsecond, but they couldn't run it on the\npublic internet. The public internet was\njust too slow. And going through this\njourney of like, what do we do about\nthat? Do we go the model of dropping the\nvalidator set from 2,000 validators to\na 100 validators? Do we try and make\neveryone run in the same data center?\nLike, how is this solved in TradFi?\nBecause this is solved in TradFi, right?\nBut it's centralized. But it's\ncentralized. So how do we build it in a\ndecentralized way? And that was kind of\nwhere the idea for Double Zero first\nkind of, you know, you get those ideas\nin your head, and you just some of them\nstick around for six months, and you're\nlike, okay, this is a real thing. I\nshould go find some people and build a\ncompany out of this and launch a\nprotocol. So, let's talk about Double\nZero. Give us the TLDDR. What is\nDouble Zero? How did the idea come to\nfruition? Who gave you money to build\nit? Why didn't you do it with Solana?\nYeah, give us the details.\nSo, Double Zero is a physical fiber\ninfrastructure network for high\nperformance distributed systems. And\nthere's a lot of different things to\nbreak down there. At its core, what\nwe're building is a parallel network to\nthe public internet. So, as most people\nknow, the public internet runs over\nfiber cables. Like 99 plus percentage of\nall data moving through the internet\ndoesn't go through satellites or space.\nIt goes through cables both on the\nground and under the ocean. And\nyou would think that there is these big\npublicly traded internet companies that\nuse the internet, right? We think of\nFacebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon as\ninternet companies. They're not really\ninternet companies. Most of the data\nthey move around the world doesn't run\nthrough the public internet. It runs\nthrough private networks that they run.\nAnd they use the internet for last mile\ndelivery. But for the most part, all\nthese big companies, they've gotten to a\nscale where the internet no longer meets\nthe demands that they have. They have to\nmove too much data. Meta is one of the\nbiggest investors in fiber\ninfrastructure in the world. And they\nstarted off first building data centers\nand because they couldn't find their\nneeds in existing data centers. And then\nnow they build undersea fiber. And\ncrypto is kind of at that same point\nwhere for us to reach the next level of\nscale, we need to be building our own\nphysical infrastructure as well. That's\na crazy thought. Yeah. I didn't\nactually know that that was the like the\ncore bit of that. So I mean does\nthat mean that Double Zero is actually\nlaying fiber cables? No. In different\nSo, we're not today. And this is the\nsame way that all these other companies\nstarted doing this is there are a large\namount of existing fiber infrastructure\nthat are run by carriers all around the\nworld, and you can take leases on them\nthe same way you can take a lease on a\nbare metal server in a data center\nsomewhere. And so Double Zero is\ncomprised of today six independent\ncontributors, and those entities are\nones that either have they own fiber or\nthey have leases on fiber, and they're\ncontributing that to the Double Zero\nnetwork. And so, you know, on the\npublic internet today, it's an\nincredible resource, right? The public\ninternet's great at what we do on it,\nbut it's not built for high\nperformance distributed systems. And so\nit's not good at that idea of we need to\nget data from this one validator out to\nthe entire rest of the network and then\na different validator and then a\ndifferent validator and then a different\nvalidator. Everything else on the\ninternet is built for like one big\ncentral server talking to many, many,\nmany clients. And this is why for years\nit was really hard to stream the Super\nBowl. Yeah. Why was it hard to stream\nthe Super Bowl? We've had live broadcast\ntelevision for, you know, 60 years at\nthis point. Well, it's because every\ntime you send out a additional\nsubscriber, that's more data that you\nhave to send out, right? And so, one of\nthe big unlocks here is on a private\nnetwork, we can use technology that's\nnot available on the public internet\nlike multicast. And multicast is what\nTradFi uses for pricing feeds, is how\nthey move data around the world really\nefficiently. And we can bring that to\nblockchain for the first time. And this\nis not like a small performance\nimprovement. These are 10x to 100x\nperformance improvements compared to\nthe public internet, which is pretty\nsubstantial. There's a great question\ncoming through here from the live stream\nand please do keep them coming through\nit. It says why should we or anyone\ntrust another decentralized\ninfrastructure when a lot of the other\nones ended up like VC owned or dead? Who\nwho's going to be using Double Zero?\nWell, I want to start with the first\npremise of who do you think owns the\ninternet today? Do you think it's a\nbunch of nonprofit foundations or do you\nthink it's a bunch of private equity\ncompanies and venture capitalists and\npension funds and you know all of the\nnormal things that own equity\ncompanies, right? There's only actually\n20 to 21, depends how you count, tier one\nISPs in the world. So that means if\nthere's 20 companies that collude\ntogether, they can turn off the internet\nfor everybody. Yeah. And also if you\nlook at like internet to your house, if\nyou were in the United States, chances\nare you have one or maybe two internet\nservice providers. Europe's a little\nbetter, but all the internet\ninfrastructure in many countries in\nEurope is owned by the government. Yeah.\nRight. Like I believe in France, all of\nyour fiber is actually run by the\ngovernment and then leased out to\ncompanies that then operate ISPs. That\nis a model where you still have a\ncentralized actor controlling it. So to\nget first off the premise I think is\nworth pushing back on because it's not\nsaying why would you use a physical\ninfrastructure network like Double Zero\ncompared to the platonic ideal of how\nthis should be done. It's what is our\nbenchmark we're comparing ourselves to.\nSo then going from there, Double Zero\nhas multiple independent contributors,\nand so we have that censorship\nresistance guarantee of if one provider\nstarts censoring you, there are other\npathways your data can take to get to\nthe validators and the places that it\nneeds to go to. The other thing too is\non the public internet today, you have\nno guarantee on traffic. And I don't\njust mean guarantee like an SLA of how\nlong it takes your data to get there,\nwhich you don't have. There's no\nguarantee that there isn't a someone in\nthe middle inspecting your data, looking\nat it, modifying it, holding your data\nback so they can front run you. All of\nthese types of things you have no\nguarantees about on the public\ninternet. But in Double Zero, we can\nprovide that. We know exactly how long\nit takes data to get from point A to\npoint B. And so if there's a network\nlink in the middle that is sometimes\nholding some people's data back, maybe\nto try and front run them, maybe for\nsomething else, we can catch that and we\ncan slash them. And so we bring the type\nof cryptoeconomic security and the sort\nof idea like the power of Bitcoin in the\nearly days was it weaponizes greed to\nproduce positive sum outcomes. Right? My\nincentive is to catch you cheating\nbecause it makes me more money, and your\nincentive is to catch me cheating\nbecause it makes you more money. And\nthat reciprocal system we don't have on\nthe internet today. Yeah. Yeah. I think\nyou answered that very eloquently. I've\ngot another one, another question here.\nAnd this this is this one just goes as\nhard.\nDecentralized infrastructure. It sounds\ngood, but is Double Zero just IPFS plus\nmarketing? What what what's the new\napproach here? So, IPFS is a first off,\nit's a storage network, right? And\nso, Double Zero, we are not a smart\ncontract network. No one's this is not a\nnew L1 or an L2. It's way below the\nstack in that. And you know, we don't\nhave any compute resources or storage\nresources. All this is is data delivery\nand bandwidth. And so you can think\nabout this from that from that\nperspective of the challenge with most\nalternatives to centralized web two\nservices today is they are lower\nperformance and more expensive.\nDouble Zero is I think the first deepen\nnetwork, if you want to call it a deep\nnetwork. It's not really a deepen\nnetwork, but that I've come across where\nthe baseline service is higher than you\ncan get in web 2. Now, we don't have and\nwe're not competing with like TradFi\ncompanies, right? If you look at like\nCitadel and Jump, like their\nhigh-frequency trading networks are more\nperformant than the Double Zero network,\nbut we are much more performant than the\npublic internet. And so, the trade-off\nthat you're usually asked to make in\ncrypto is this thing is going to be more\nexpensive and less performant, but it\nhas decentralization. And that matters a\nton. I don't want to like downplay that.\nThat is the entire value of Bitcoin or\nSolana or Ethereum. But in Double Zero,\nwe are more performant than the public\ninternet. And so, plus there's\ndecentralization, plus there's economic\nsecurity behind it. So, if you are a\ncompany that can afford to run fiber all\naround the world, you have, you know,\n$200 million a year on infrastructure\nbudget. You're not going to use Double\nZero. But if you are not that, this is a\nvery attractive solution to you. And\nalso if you're something like a\nblockchain that requires multiple\nentities to be involved in running that\nnetwork, you're not going to be happy\nwith one centrally run network anyway.\nYeah. When it comes to this idea and how\nit was born, I've spoken to obviously to\nfrom Solana, and he gave me the Genesis\nstory and and his experience at Qualcomm\nand taking a lot of those ideas and then\nbuilding out Solana's infrastructure.\nDid you have a similar sort of process\nlike seeing how Solana does things, how\nits network runs, and then taking that\napproach and being like we can do this\nin an infrastructure play and many, many\ndifferent distributed systems need this\nkind of infrastructure? Yeah.\nI mean I think the probably better\norigin story for this is one, so\nthere's three co-founders for Double\nZero. Matteo Ward's origin story here is\nprobably the most relevant. So he\nactually thought about building this\nback in 2017. Okay. And talked to a few\nfolks about it. And his background is\nyou know, he worked for Global Crossing\nback in the day, which is the first\ncompany to run fiber all around the\nworld in the late 90s. He did a bunch\nof shortwave work, a bunch of microwave\ntower work, built out fiber networks\nacross Latin America, ran a carrier\nbusiness down there and was sort of\nthinking if crypto really is the future,\nlike we need it to be running on this\nhigh performance infrastructure. But in\n2017, the fastest thing in the world was\nEthereum, which did about, you know, 14\nto 21 things per second with 30 second\nblock times. And so there really wasn't\na need at that point. But now we have\nSolana, Aptos, Fast L2s, we have\nHyperliquid, we have all sorts of\nnetworks that now, like for years, the\nsoftware was the thing holding\nblockchains back. GU wasn't very good in\n2017, right? These these networks just\nweren't mature enough that speed and\nlatency mattered. Software is no longer\nthe problem. The limiting factor for\nblockchain scalability today, it's not\nhow fast you can prove a ZK proof. It's\nnot how good the code is on a validator\nclient. It's the public internet. Yeah.\nOkay. When it comes to rolling out the\ninfrastructure,\nwhat is the approach here? I mean, like\nwhere are you starting? Are you just\napproaching ISPs and and fiber fiber\nactual fiber infrastructure companies\nand saying, \"Hey, let us let us use your\nnetwork and run our software basically.\"\nSo, as I mentioned before, most of these\ncompanies today are owned by private\nequity or they're publicly traded\ncompanies, neither of which is\nparticularly crypto friendly. And so, we\nhave found that the early contributors\nto the network are trading firms that\nalready have crypto divisions. And so,\nyou know, Jump and Galaxy are two\nnetwork contributors, which, you know,\nmakes sense given their other\nactivities. We also have two venture\ncapital firms that have actually decided\nto build out network capacity as a way\nof earning tokens. So distributed global\nand Rockaway X are doing that as well.\nAnd then we have two companies that\nanyone in operating in crypto will know\nvery well, which is Teraswitch and\nLatitude, and they're network\ncontributors as well. And they\n\n\nActually, I own and operate servers inside of data centers. And they're one of the major providers of servers for a bunch of high-performance blockchains out there today. And so they'd been sort of slowly eating away at a little bit of this problem by getting dedicated fiber between their data centers. But what they kind of realize is if they contribute that network capacity to Double Zero, we can grow the performance of the entire validator network. And that's really the thing is that getting a few validators on faster connections doesn't really help. But the minute you get most of the validators on a fast network connection, you can raise the number of CUs in a Solana block from 50 million to 500 million. You can shrink block times. You can scale capacity out even more. And that's where the sort of idea of accelerating crypto by a decade over the next two years comes from. I think it's very possible that we look forwards in two years and we see multiple networks running multiple hundreds of thousands of transactions not on test nets with you know limited environments but on mainnets that are distributed all around the world.\n\nHow hard has it been to like, I mean, you guys had a great raise. I think it was 20, 28 million at a 400 million valuation initially. Um, was it easy to sell the idea to some of the VCs and initial investors? Uh, were, you know, were Tony and Raj some of the initial investors? Maybe you can chat a bit about that. Yeah, you know, I was thinking it was going to be more of a challenge to get people interested in this project than it was. Um, this is the least sexy project in crypto. Uh, this is physical fiber in the ground. This is like the stuff that no one gets like really I thought excited about. Um, but it turns out that this is a problem that a lot of people deeply understand in crypto. And a lot of the best crypto VCs, they were junior partners or interns back in the '90s. And so they saw the first wave of the internet. They saw the first wave of private networking come into these businesses and how transformational it was. You fast forward, you know, 25 years, 30 years, now they're the ones making that are GPS at these funds. And so there's a part of this where we'd be talking to some of these folks and it was almost like the 25 to 30 year olds didn't get it as much as the 40-year-olds. They're like, \"Oh, I saw this before.\" Like this reminds me of some of the work I was doing earlier in my career. And so we have an incredible group of backers on the project and uh it's been a real pleasure to work with them on this.\n\nWhen it's running like a pure infrastructure play, I mean there's no token involved or anything like that, right? What's the business model? How does that work? So we are a token network. Okay. Yes. Um so there is a token for Double Zero. Um and that token is really integral to aligning incentives and functionality of the network. So validators and RPCs and other sort of users of the network on that perspective pay to operate on it. Okay. Those rewards um are paid in the Double Zero token. They're distributed out to bandwidth contributors, resource providers, and then you know a portion of those fees are also burned um on the network as well as a civil resistance mechanism. The really interesting piece is most of the criticisms of proof of stake and deepen networks are that they reward basically passive existence and our model doesn't do that. We actually published a blog post a few days ago called proof of utility. And really the model here is we reward useful connectivity and we reward it only from the reward pool that's coming in from users of the network. So we don't have crazy inflation on the network. We don't have sort of passive existence rewards. It's a similar model to proof of work in Bitcoin where if you produce 50% of the hash power, you will over an average period of time get 50% of the rewards. If you provide the most useful network connectivity pathway that reaches the most stake, you are going to be rewarded proportionally for that.\n\nOkay. Was it hard to come up with that sort of a token incentive structure? Who was the brains behind that? Uh I mean it it's very much a team effort on this. Um Nihar is our chief economist. He's been instrumental in helping think through these problems. Um but it's very different. You know, you look at a proof of stake network and one of the things to remember is a validator in Singapore is useful to me in New York. My transaction can be included in a block that it's building just fine, assuming, of course, my data gets there in time. Um, bandwidth connectivity in Singapore does me no good if my validator is in New York. And so we had to think of a model that was fundamentally geographically and local aware. Proof of stake networks and proof of work networks, locality does not matter. In a network like Double Zero, local locality is of paramount importance. Yes, of course. Yeah. I mean, it's like anything in the like we we all played a lot of internet games like I used to live in South Africa. Yeah. I I played a lot of World of Warcraft. When I when I logged in and I was on a European server, I always had 300 milliseconds of uh you know, latency because it is what it is.\n\nI've got a few more questions coming in here. One of these is really interesting. DeFi Dynamo. Are you admitting the public internet is already holding back blockchains? The public internet is absolutely holding back blockchains today. Um my my general thesis here is you have left curve and you have right curve. And left curve is the Bitcoin guys. And they're totally right. You need to be able to validate blocks on an FM radio broadcast from space completely offline or we go all the way to private connectivity. And I think anything in the middle is uh first off the internet is holding back blockchain. The second thing is this the sort of censorship resistance guarantees that people think they have on these networks really don't exist. Like the internet is quite easy for governments to censor. Yeah. And that's the weak part. It's not how many validators you have. It's not how many client diversity. Like that all matters as well. But the fundamental choke point is if all the OECD countries say no more Ethereum and they send a letter to your ISP that says no more Ethereum, what are you broadcasting your blocks on? Like you have to go full Bitcoin or or accept that like we need to push maximum performance.\n\nUm I've got a couple more coming through. I'm I'm just going to I'm going to entertain the questions because they're coming through. So thank you very much for engaging with us and sending these questions. Uh, Infra insider, your validated token sale was only for accredited investors. Does that make your infrastructure exclusive and and not inclusive? Accredited investor requirements are not uh something we have any control over. Um, most countries and most jurisdictions have some version of an accredited investor rule. Um, I will say we were the first uh regulated token sale that Coin List has done in the United States since 2019. And so we we went through pretty extensive efforts to make this as accessible as we as we could um while still being compliant with relevant rules and regulations. Um one of the things that we were able to do that I most sales have not been able to do is if you're outside the US um you know we have locks that are the minimum required in your jurisdiction. For the United States that is a one-year lock.\n\nOkay. Um this is another good question. Bandwidth Bob fiber optics costs millions. How will you on board small infrastructure providers who lack the capital to participate? So it depends. I I I guess I'm not exactly sure which small infrastructure providers would have fiber but not the capital for like the Double Zero contribution is very small cost compared to the cost of actually putting in fiber. But we work with small data centers that are interested in like basically delivering Double Zero services to validators operating within them. And so the way that that works is you basically bookend each leg of a piece of fiber with a Double Zero device which is a switch. Uh these are commercial enterprise-grade switches. So it's not like some hardware we've built ourselves. Um and then that allows validators in that data center to connect in to the Double Zero network. And so um you know uh chances are any data center already has one of these switches in it or even quite frankly more expensive switches than this inside of it.\n\nWhen it comes to like increased use of Double Zero, where do you see this going? I mean like is Solana going to tap into Double Zero's um infrastructure? Uh what does that look like in the next two to five years? Yeah, I mean the answer there is it's really up to those networks and those validators, right? The Solana community has largely said and the Solana protocol developers have said they're very interested in pushing past the bounds of what's possible on the public internet and Double Zero is a great way to do that. And so if you saw uh the release of Alpenlow, um you know there's mentions to Double Zero and multicast in that in that as well which is the new Solana consensus proposal. Um, we've had lots of conversations with L2s and other L1s about um, you know, coming on board and and joining the Double Zero network, but at the end of the day, no one can force the validators to adopt Double Zero. They have to evaluate it for themselves, see if it's going to be something that makes them more money, and see if the community is interested in pushing past what's possible on the public internet. Um, but the expansion areas for Double Zero are even outside of crypto as well. You can have storage networks either cryptographic storage networks or non-cryptographic storage networks, CDNs, um, AI workloads and training data that has to be moved around. The there's a whole series of companies, most companies you've heard of that are software companies run their own private networks today. Um, and many of them may find Double Zero to be an attractive alternative. One thing to remember is there's no prioritization on the public internet. You would think that Epic Games can just pay a priority fee. So all the Fortnite data is prioritized and kids can have good gaming experiences. That's not part of the internet spec. Just get in line with everyone else.\n\nWe're going to wrap it up, but one more question here. I'm I'm not quite sure how accurate this is. So it's from Max Wrestellin. After the Solana test net, you plan multi-chain support. Why not wait until fiber works on Bitcoin or L1's before scaling out? That's I I I don't know. Yeah, you might be able to. I'm not quite sure what they're what they're asking. um you know, Bitcoin and the Ethereum L1 are not going to benefit from Double Zero because they're not networks that are built to op like where speed and latency actually matter. And so the question to ask yourself if you're looking at could Double Zero help this blockchain or this application is is there a capacity question where if you get more bandwidth things get better or a system where if latency is reduced performance or value increases. Now, this is true in Tradfi. If you've read Flash Boys, like that's the name of the game, right? Bitcoin is not designed for that. Bitcoin is designed to be slow. The Ethereum L1 is designed to be slow. And until changes are made to that protocol, there's really no reason someone would opt to use Double Zero, I don't think. What about Lightning? I mean, uh certainly. Yeah. Uh Bitcoin L2s and whatever we qualify Lightning as nowadays, uh those are systems where speed and performance really matter, unlike the Bitcoin L1.\n\nAll right, Austin, thank you very much for your time. Thank you to you watching for all your thoughtful questions. It's really great to see you doing something new and exciting. Um, I think it's always interesting to hear about infrastructure players as well and not not just more of the same kind of stuff and I think that you are really trying to prove uh or solve something that is a perplexing problem for a lot of infrastructure and blockchains and different distributed networks. So, it's been great to catch up with you again. Thank you very much for watching the live stream. and we will be back uh in about 30 minutes or so with our next couple of interviews. Um catch us then. We're here live at Proof of Work. Thank you very much for watching.\n[Music]\n",
