speaking to someone from the NBA at a Bitcoin conference.\nSo, let's start with that.\nLike, how did you get into Bitcoin?\nWhat do you know about Bitcoin?\nWhy Bitcoin?\nYeah.\nNo, I got into Bitcoin and crypto in general, right?\nI think it's a whole conglomerate, right?\nI got in the last two years ago.\nUm, for me, you know, in the locker room, I'm always a financial literacy guy, right?\nI'm always the guy that's giving the young guys advice in terms of, you know, checks and balances, how to create wealth, passive income, and really just to be able to take your wealth and let it last because at the end of the day, father time's undefeated, and there's a point in time where you're not going to be playing no more, and you're going to have this amount of money, and you needed to make it work for you and last.\nSo for me now, you know, what really got me into, you know, the web3 and Bitcoin is that it's another form of financial freedom, right?\nI think this is the version of a digital gold, and this is something that has a great runway where I'm preaching to guys that want to have more diversity in their portfolio that Bitcoin is an asset that they should definitely consider and have it in their wallet.\nLet's talk about that a little bit more.\nThere's so many professional sportsmen that really struggle to maintain their wealth over time, and I think a lot of them get caught up in the trappings of living an expensive lifestyle and spending the money that they have cuz they're earning so much money.\nUm, how do you change that perception?\nBecause I think most sportsmen want to live a lavish life, but they don't realize that your money doesn't go that far.\nThat's another reason why I'm very motivated to get into the space and with Bitcoin, but in just in blockchain and crypto in general, right?\nI think, um, unfortunately, you know, especially in basketball, right?\nMost of us come from underprivileged communities, minority backgrounds where we don't get that financial literacy.\nAnd we're not taught how to manage our money.\nAnd I think, um, you know, everything in life except finance, you're in control of, right?\nYou're in control of what shirt you want to wear today.\nYou know, where do you what car you want to drive?\nWhat do you want to eat?\nWho do you want to marry?\nYou're always in control.\nBut the one area where we give a complete stranger control is finance, right?\nAnd for me, you know, being elder statesman and understanding that the reason why I love crypto and web3 and Bitcoin is that you could take back your financial freedom.\nCrypto, you could take USDC and put in a safe vault and instead of making the shitty 4% that the banks, the centralized banks give you, you could put in a safe vault and get 12%.\nRight?\nThose are little avenues and areas that you could create this passive income where you when you're done playing or even when you're currently playing because what I stress to guys is don't start saving when the show is over.\nYou want to save when in the peak of your career where you're making all this big money because guess what?\nCompound interest.\nYou know 12% of a million dollars is compared to 12% of $12 million is totally different, right?\nSo for me being a vessel to that and giving that financial literacy education with a area that is new to Americans but definitely far more advanced overseas is crypto and Bitcoin.\nOne of our recent stories that we wrote about you at COINTELEGRAPH was you know missing out on a contract paid in Bitcoin.\nLet's talk about that.\nI mean did you fumble the bag?\nWhat happened there?\nWhat's the backstory?\nFriend of mine back in 2015 around the same time I signed my deal.\nHe's like you know what just take 10 grand of your money.\nYou're going to spend that at the club anyways or on a vacation.\nTake that money and why don't you just buy some Bitcoin and just hold on to it, right?\nUm, obviously you said no.\nI said no.\nIt's young.\nWhen you're young, you don't understand and you and you're like, what is this digital asset?\nI think that's what's happens to a lot of people sometimes where they miss these great investments or great opportunities that someone gives you the tools, but the messenger might not be the same, right?\nIt might have been different if maybe a Ryan Fang came up to me in 2016 and said, \"Hey, Tristan, let's take 20 grand of your money and then let's buy some Bitcoin, right?\"\nSo, it's all a hindsight, but everything comes back around.\nBut I use that story and that that situation where I want to help these young guys because I truly believe that there's going to be a point in time where Bitcoin will be a million dollars, right?\nSo the fact that right now it's at today it's 107 might be 109.\nIt's still a good time to get it because the runway is humongous where it it's truly the beginning of the dotcom era.\nThat's exactly what this is feel like.\nThere's quite a few stories coming out now especially in the US of NFL players or NBA players starting to take some of their earnings in Bitcoin.\nHow long do you think it takes until that becomes a lot more of a norm especially as people understand that Bitcoin is sound money.\nUh, it's a fantastic store of value.\nIt's a monetary protocol.\nIt's a medium of exchange.\nIt ticks a lot of these boxes.\nBut like you say, in 2016, you didn't know any better.\nI'll be honest, I didn't know any better in 2016.\nUm, do you think it will get to a point where a lot of athletes are like, \"Hey, I want to hold on to some Bitcoin and that would be a reality.\"\nI think with President Trump and and and his dedication and his will to to to create this mass adoption to to crypto and Bitcoin, I think it's gonna open a lot of eyes because I have teammates now that ask me about it.\nThey're asking me like, you know, do I buy Bitcoin?\nDo I buy XRP?\nDo I buy Solana?\nAnd what I always tell people is that when you're first getting into the space, go with the OG.\nThe OG is Bitcoin.\nYou know, that that's the one that when Bitcoin rises, everything follows, right?\nThey're the head honcho.\nSo, I always preach to guys, you know, get yourself Bitcoin.\nWherever amount you can get, whatever you feel comfortable, get that and hold on to it, right?\nBecause at whatever it is valued now, it's going to be way more down the line.\nIt's like buying Apple stock back in the 90s or buying Amazon back in the early 2000s.\nIt's only going to grow and have a runway.\nAnd I and I honestly do believe that there's going to be a point in time where players are going to be more inclined to want to be paid in Bitcoin because they're going to see the growth.\nAnd if and if the teams don't want to do it, I guarantee you when the checks come from the direct deposits, they'll take that money and go on to whatever exchanges and go buy themselves some Bitcoin.\nI know Scotty Pippen's here at this this conference.\nDo you know him?\nI mean, he's a big Bitcoin advocate now as well, and he said some hilarious things about Bitcoin over over the over the last year or two.\nUm, but what do you think about people like him being involved in the industry as well?\nI mean, listen, uh, you know, at the end of the day, I I always have respect for fellow fellow players that have played in the NBA, right?\nAt the end of the day, the NBA is a fraternity.\nIt's a brotherhood, right?\nUh, you know, Scotty Scotty's an older man.\nHe's an OG.\nSo he might say some off-the-wall stuff, but like that's just like that's in America when when the when the older guy says some off the- wall stuff, you say just being, right?\nIt's like you at the barbecue when you when your uncle just just starts rattling stuff out.\nBut um you know, the fact that he wants to educate himself and I think it's more so for his kids.\nYou know, his son was actually a teammate of mine with the Lakers, Scotty Jr.\nSo, it's good to see, you know, athletes and minorities willing to get into a space of and a new form of finance to educate themselves because at the end of the day, if he can motivate three kids from Chicago to to learn more about crypto and Bitcoin, then he's done his job, right?\nThat's that's what our that's what our us as athletes, that's what we we yearn on and that's what we pride ourselves is how we can help our community.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI look at guys like Johnny football.\nI'm sure you know Johnny Manziel and and and I mean like that's a hard I I don't want to say a heartbreaking story because I think he's come to terms with how everything ended for him, but you just wonder if people like that had more guidance and more people like you mentoring them at at that age when they have that sort of stardom.\nHow many people that have you encountered in your career that have had similar sort of problems and like fallen off the rails and things might have been different if they'd learned about Bitcoin or learned about financial literacy or just learned about the opportunity that they have in front of them and not being like pulled aside by the the the you know the trappings of life and everything.\nEverybody wants a and wants to be able to we come from areas that we take care of a lot of people right and unfortunately with taking care of a lot of people there's a lot of pressure.\nIt's called survival's remorse, right?\nSo I I it looks crazy if a guy lives a lavish life and his people don't aren't taken care of, right?\nSo with that being said, you got to do a good job delegating and really holding to yourself strong to to kind of budget out who gets what at what amount that they can actually where could be where where you can sustain a certain lifestyle, but also they can be taken care of, right?\nI'm a big I take care of my family.\nSo, I take care of my brothers.\nMy mom, God rest her soul, I took care of her as well.\nWhen I got drafted to the NBA, she retired.\nI made my mom retire when I was the age of 19.\nBecause at the end of the day, I judge a man by how he takes care of his family.\nOf course, you got to have some boundaries and understand you can't do everything for them.\nBut I think for players, it's not so much they try to go broke.\nIt's sometimes it could be the financial advisor stealing from them.\nIt could be not paying your taxes.\nIt could be child support.\nOr it could be gambling from.\nThere's so many ways where a player can lose a lot of their wealth.\nSo, for me, it's more so here's another avenue outside of what your your mom and pop financial advisor cuz those guys are all old dinosaurs and they only know what they know.\nThey they say, \"Here, give me your money.\nLet me put it in Fidelity and just let it sit there and you pay them a commission.\"\nIt's like you you guys should go do that yourself.\nSo, for me, it's just like, \"Let me give you another avenue.\"\nAnd for me, I've built a level of respect in the league and a rapport where guys value what I have to say.\nSo that's why I'm a big advocate in terms of educating other athletes, but more so educating our youth.\nI think that's the most important thing, right?\nLet's go find the 17-year-old Tristan Thompson and teach him a blockchain before he becomes 24 and signs $32B contract.\nBy the time he gets to that age, if he has it has that understanding, he will go and get put a million dollars into Bitcoin.\nAnd instead of, you know, the contract being worth 82 million, at least one one million would have probably been 1 billion dollars.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nLike that's how I look at this.\nWhere where do you see yourself going in the next 5 to 10 years in this in this industry?\nHave have you given much thought to that?\nSo for me, it's uh you know, I I view this as part of my post career.\nI think it's very important for guys like myself to to to always give back and I feel like financial literacy is a big thing that I'm that I'm that I'm a part of.\nI I feel like it's important for our youth, but it's also just important for the mass adoption, right?\nI think crypto and like I always say it's it's the cup is 95% full, but to to to the web too and with the DJ and say the normies, it's only about 3%.\nRight?\nSo there's there's there's about 90 to 95% room to grow, right?\nAnd in order for us, everybody wants Bitcoin to be a million dollars, right?\nLet me tell you the secret.\nThat empty cup you got to start pouring in.\nOnce they pour in, everything rises.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nSo that's an area where I want to help bridge the gap.\nBut the way you bridge the gap is by educating, giving the tools, giving giving safe, good advice where people feel comfortable instead of going to Fidelity, H&R, like going to these institutions opening a wallet and buying themselves a bitcoin or or Ethereum or something, whatever you feel comfortable with.\nThat's how you started.\nAnd the education is what needs to happen.\nBut that's but also that's why it's very important like you said education.\nBut that's why what I preach to people is that yes, Bitcoin is amazing.\nIt's the OG.\nBut it's a team.\nThese other coins are just as important too.\nEthereum is just as important.\nSolana is important.\nXRP, those are all important because in order for the top to reach its max, sometimes you need the bottom to rise.\nAnd when the bottom rises and people make money, then they might rot they'll rotate, you know.\nSo like everyone's just as important.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nLike look at Bitcoin, look at\n\n\nLike LeBron James, and you look at Ethereum is a Steph Curry.\nThen Solana is the Kevin Durant, right?\nAll those people are important for the business of basketball.\nSo this, so the business of blockchain, everyone still is important.\nUm, lastly, just your thoughts on this conference.\nI don't know if this is the first Bitcoin conference that you've been to.\nIt's a crazy thing.\nIt is, man.\nThis is amazing.\nSo I've been to token in Singapore.\nUh, so this is my second conference being to, and uh, you know, like David and his team, uh, uh, you know, I got a chance to talk to David Bailey, and he's the fact that he put this together has been awesome.\nUh, there's been so many great people, great speakers, and and and I love the unity.\nI love the togetherness that that that our ecosystem is creating, and it's becoming so much more globally, and that's how you know you're on the right path of greatness.\nAnd so being a being able to be here and be a part of it, it's it's amazing.\nIt's I I highly recommend it to people that are in the space that wonder if they should come or not.\nIt's good just to be around new people and just get to understand what's going on in the space, what people are building, creating, trying to do to help help the ecosystem and not extract.\nYeah, definitely.\nTristan, thanks so much for your time.\nThank you for talking to us.\nWe I look forward to seeing your evolution in this uh in this space and and hopefully we get to do this again.\nAppreciate it, bro.\nThank you for having me, brother.\nYes, sir.\nCheers, everybody.\n",
