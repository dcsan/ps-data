  "cleanText": "Hello and welcome back to Cointelegraph's live stream right here from Paris at Proof of Talk.\nWe are talking to a number of bigname speakers that have taken the stage here at this fantastic event.\nIf you are watching the live stream on X or YouTube, please go ahead and drop your questions in the channel if you want to pose some questions to our guests throughout the day.\nWe will continue to be live a few more times this afternoon.\nSo keep it locked on Cointelegraph socials as we go.\nI'm joined now by CEO of Hashgraph, Eric Piscini.\nUm we actually just sat on a panel this morning talking about AI and blockchain.\nUm but let's just set the scene for the viewers out there that aren't too familiar with Hedera and Hashgraph.\nUh what you guys do, what your real use case is and and the majority of your your users around the world.\nYeah, good.\nThank you for having me.\nUm it's been fun here right in Paris.\nI was born here so I always love coming back here.\nUm so Hedera is a project that that started in 2018.\nUh Dr. Leemon Baird and men arand started the project the co-founders and the foundation was we're going to build a very efficient higherforming layer one that is going to be able to activate any kind of use cases with very specific characteristics.\nOne, the transaction fees are denominated in dollars, not in crypto, which means that if you're a business, you can build an application and know exactly how much you're going to pay in the future.\nVery important.\nSecond is the technology itself, which is technically if you're in technology is not a blockchain.\nIt's a DAG with a gossip mechanism.\nYou can look it up.\nThere's a lot of interesting things that Dr. Man invented and they are part of this very very unique and the third piece is Hedera as a council which actually is meeting today in DC so I'm missing the cancel meeting as we speak but the cancel is um 30 plus organizations running the network on behalf of the ofa right soa is a public ledger but permissioned because only those 30 organizations can run the network and there are Google and IBM and Dell and many many big big firms doing this and I'm the CEO of Hashgraph and Hashgraph is the team behind the Hedera network.\nSo the founders are with Hashgraph everybody in marketing, communication, product engineering, security blah blah blah blah blah.\nEverybody is working for Hashgraph pretty much except for the people giving grants to activate the ecosystems and they are working for the Hedera Foundation.\nWhen it comes to talking about um Hashgraph and Hedera not being a blockchain but a DAG um maybe you can just explain that a little bit more and why that specific use case works in the industry and why it's very uh favorable for enterprises and people that want a sort of more permissioned network than they would get with using Ethereum or something else.\nYeah.\nAnd so it's a little bit of a a layer game, right?\nSo which layer are you are you looking at?\nSo if you look at blockchain today uh one of the challenges of a traditional let's call that traditional blockchain is uh performance because you have to wait for the blocks to be created to get finality of your transactions and the second challenge is fair ordering right and with DAG when we are not the only DAG in the market by the way but with DAG you actually avoid that you don't have to think of those issues because you are providing by default fair ordering which is extremely extremely important in capital markets.\nYeah.\nRight.\nUh you don't want someone to front run you when you about to trade something, right?\nA token or anything.\nUh and then the second piece is it's it's much more uh the performance of the network is much faster.\nSo for example, we can go to 20,000 transaction per second at the layer one.\nRight?\nSo typically you get that level of performance at layer twos because they cannot achieve that on Ethereum or you know any other layer one.\nWe are really really efficient.\nThat's the value of DAG, right?\nAnd then of course that translates into adoption by enterprise, adoption by the retail market because they can benefit from those two things, fair ordering and high performance.\nYeah.\nUm I've got a question coming in uh from the live stream and I'm I'm just going to pose it to you from Bisben.\nYou connected a SpaceX satellite project.\nDo you really expect IoT scale adoption from space or is this sci-fi hype?\nI think that's quite an interesting question.\nUm so it's hard to comment on, you know, rumors, right?\nUm so you know the what I can say is that our blockchain would be really well positioned to support the use case which is payments right because we can do that uh very efficiently.\nSo for example a a consensus transaction uh is a fraction of a cent dollar cent uh so when you do payments and your transaction fees are you know 50 cents that could limit you in what you can do from a payment point of view because we are a fraction of a cent in some in some cases hundreds of a cent right so really really cheap transaction fees then you can actually enable micro payments yes and and um payment streaming right And so of course those platforms that we've been for others can be used by major organizations to deliver their own payment solutions.\nWhen it comes to the the Hedera Council and and all these bigname you know household uh institutions being part of that council, some people in the ecosystem might say that this is never going to be as decentralized as you would want it to be if only a handful of participants can be the network validators as it were.\nWhat are your thoughts on that and and the general approach?\nSo, I'm I'm going to create a storm on Twitter if I answer the but but that's okay.\nUm um we did an analysis, right?\nYou have the the Nakamoto uh ratio, right?\nThe decentralization ratio.\nUm and we looked at that against Ethereum for example.\nAnd because of the Ethereum pools, right, we were actually on par with Ethereum when it comes to decentralization because we do have really independent organization that are running the nodes.\nBut I would argue that quality in decentralization of the node is actually more important than the quantity.\nYes.\nAnd let me explain when IBM, Google and Dell are saying we are going to run a node on Hedera, right?\nThey are not just committing to stake, they are also committing a brand, their brand to support a project and they will never do something dramatic or nefarious against the network because they would damage their brands, right?\nSo that is an additional layer of um another dimension of analysis when you think about decentralization because it depends on who is actually enabling that decentralization.\nI think that's really important in our context.\nIt's interesting that you say that because I met the the head of web 3 at Amazon earlier today at the the breakfast that we were at and and I look I know this as a fact but I don't think a lot of people do.\nYou know more than 50% of um you know Ethereum's validator infrastructure is running on AWS servers.\nSo when when you think about it like that it's like if we're going to be pointing fingers at people for centralization.\nExactly.\nSo we pay a lot of attention to that too.\nSo for example, I think we have 20 different cloud and infrastructure locations running nodes.\nSo we are not centralized from a cloud infrastructure point of view either.\nRight.\nThat's a really important topic.\nYou're right.\nUm I've got another question coming from the from the the live stream and please do keep them keep them coming through.\nThis is your chance to ask some of the big names the industry the the hard questions that I might not be willing to ask.\nNot too hell.\nNot too hard.\nYou can always say no comments.\nUm yeah, from Ola XT, RWA tokenization is sparking.\nSwell's swell calls brewing.\nWhat's the play behind this trigger?\nLet's talk about RWA tokenization.\nUm I just spoke to Reeve Collins who was one of the original founders of Tether and I think that's the original RWA tokenization.\nYou know, tokenizing dollars, that's that's one one flavor.\nIt's now morphed into something way bigger.\nYou can do property, you can be tokenized securities, you know, everything and anything.\nUm, do you see that as the real future like core use for a lot of these different blockchain protocols that exist today?\nYes, but not the only one, right?\nSo, I think I think tokenization is was part of the foundation of blockchain, right?\nI've been in blockchain for 12 years.\nYeah, we were talking about tokenization maybe with different names, but we are talking about tokenizing assets.\nWhether it's a physical asset, a digital asset, an identity, a right, a legal right, we've been tokenizing from the beginning.\nSo tokenization is just getting more traction today because now we finally are able to deliver those solutions around tokenization at scale.\nI think that's so it's not a new thing.\nYeah.\nBut it's getting more traction today because we can actually deliver at scale.\nWhat's exciting to me is um you you you create an environment with tokenization where you democratize access to a lot of things that people don't have access to and yes technology is one piece of the solution the regulatory environment has to change as well right so if you're in the US and you want to invest into a real estate project typically you have to have a lot of money and you have to be an accredited investor with tokenization You don't have to have a lot of money anymore because you can invest a $100 in but you still have to be an accredited investor.\nYes.\nRight.\nSo there is the technology piece is fixed now.\nIt's done.\nNow we have to fix the regulatory environment.\nBut if you scale out and you say at the global level now you can you have people in other jurisdictions who can invest into assets in the US and vice versa at a very low cost with a secondary market.\nAnd that really change the nature of markets.\nYeah.\nUh and we're going to see that around real estate.\nWe have a project on real estate, many projects, but one that's very very uh well known by our community called Rats One.\nOkay.\nAnd we are tokenizing real estate and enabling people to invest and resell their participation into real estate projects on on Hedera.\nOkay.\nSo, that's a key use case, right?\nI mean, and and a very real one that exists.\nIt's very real.\nIt's on it's live.\nYou can invest into those things right now.\nUm if you're in the US you have limitations as I said earlier uh but we tokenized you know money market fund we tokenized uh m mutual funds we tokenize you know identity which is usually not we we don't talk much about identity anymore but that's one way to tokenize as well you tokenize your own identity or you tokenize the identity of your AI agent which is maybe the next topic right AI.\nYeah.\nYeah, definitely.\nUm, let's talk a little bit about AI.\nI mean, Hashgraph is now integrating some some AI functionality into what you can do.\nUm, tell us what that looks like and and what the future sort of integration and use of AI uh for for your organization and your layer one is in the future.\nI think and this morning we were talking about it was great by the way.\nIt was really really good discussion.\nThank you for um moderating and and asking the right questions too.\nYou're welcome.\nUm and and we were talking about three different layers of AI and blockchain, right?\nSo the first one is decentralized AI.\nSo we cannot continue to run AI infrastructure and AI models just in centralized entities, right?\nBecause they own everything.\nThey own your input, they own your output, they own the models, they own the data.\nThey're going to get better and better and better.\nAnd um we we don't want to recreate a world where they control everything because we are going to be interacting with AI a lot in the future.\nSo we need to find a way to decentralize that infrastructure.\nSo if one of the big AI company tomorrow for some reason stops to operate, we can still benefit from that model because it is a decentralized infrastructure.\nYeah.\nSo that's number one.\nNumber two is when those AI activities are taking place, we need a a trust layer for the AI supply chain, right?\nSo from the sourcing of the data to the running of the model to the learning activities to the output and the output turning into an input all of those events must be reconnected on a ledger on a public ledger or a private ledger depending on the scenario but on a trust layer and the trust layer is a in our context and we connect all of that here.\nSo uh that's the partnership we did with Equity Lab.\nuh the partnership we did with Provi and other other companies, they they they anchor an AI activity along the AI supply chain on the Hedera so that in the future if we want to have a naughty trail of what happened we can if we want to make sure that the right data was used to feed that model to create the outcome we can yeah right that's a very important part of AI and blockchain that the trust layer and then there is the third layer which is coming now is those AI agents will need to have the ability to transact with humans, with others, uh with companies, uh and and so they're going to need a wallet, right?\nThey're going to need a blockchain piece of infrastructure and those are that's a third layer and we are working on all three as a to make sure that we achieve that vision.\nYeah.\nUm I just want to probe that that second point that you made a little bit uh uh in a little bit more detail when it comes to like all the centralized AI you know tools that exist chat GPT you know DeepS gro um they're centralized and and like you say they probably have all that information on their servers they can see who prompted the the AI what and and give it a bit of an audit trail.\nUm, but you would like if you wanted the information, you would have to subpoena them or something like that.\nWhereas Yeah.\nAnd and probably they're going to say no, right?\nWhereas uh this approach gives you a lot more transparency and and a lot more accountability when it comes to using them and and and sustainability, right?\nSo, and and Ben from Singularity Net this morning was was at a very important point.\nUh, so Ben, back to you.\nuh the the point was yes everything is open source almost open source or will be open source but open source doesn't help in this context because you need so much processing power and storage to be able to run a model that even if I have access to the code and it's really good code I I don't have a billion dollar to run a data center right and so um the decentralization through open source is not a good way to do it it's not enough it's good but it's not enough yeah Um just looking forward I I I think we'll probably wrap up the conversation here.\nUm what does the the next 5 years look for look like for Hedera and Hashgraph?\nUm do you still see your main sort of user base being institutions and enterprisegrade sort of applications and could it translate a bit more into sort of retail use cases?\nHow\n\n\nPeople use Salana, Ethereum, SUI, Aptos, and all these other. So we do have retail projects, right? We have, you know, currency combat. I'm sure people know about this one. That's a really cool one. Customer engagement will always be part of our DNA. We'll continue to do this. What's interesting when I have that question is, to me, those words are merging. So, we don't have to act to actually say we're going to spend more time here or more time here. What I'm saying is those two words, retail and business, are merging into one word for different reasons. But the developers are moving from enterprise to retail to enterprise to retail. So it's not like the different people. It's the same people, but they move around. So they bring with them, you know, their expertise, their experience with Adera and so on. So I don't, I don't see us focusing on one segment of the market. Not because we could if we want to, but there's no need for that. There's no need to focus on one piece of the market. So we continue to do this, and if you guys have ideas on how to use Adera and engage with us and make sure that we build something that you can benefit from, you know, come to us and we can talk and we can engage. I think that's a very important piece of the discussion. That was actually one of the questions that came through on the live stream from Hack Hank. You're investing in hackathons with $360,000 prizes. Are these developer incentives working, or do you see it as a sort of a waste of money as it were? Like, does it work? We look at hackathon the same way we look at a investment portfolio. If you're a VC or, you know, an investor, right? You say, \"I'm going to make a bunch of bets. Most of them are going to fail, but the one who are that that are going to work are going to be amazing,\" right? And today, we have companies in our ecosystem who went through the acatan originally and are now, you know, top projects for us, generating return for themselves and fora. So yes, it does work, but you have to have the right level of expectation. You cannot expect everybody to succeed at the end of the academy, or even the winner will not sometimes win anything because maybe they don't have the infrastructure, maybe they don't have the time, maybe they were doing that for fun. Maybe, so you have to, you have to have low low expectation for aon, but I, I will not stop doing them because it's really, really important. I've been to many, I've been to a lot of the Ethereum hackathons, and I think that they're hugely valuable for any of the different protocols that are doing it. Eric, thank you so much for your time. It was good to catch up with you. If you guys enjoyed this conversation, please like and retweet it. If you're watching the live stream on X, if you're on YouTube, once again, give us a like, subscribe to our channel. We're bringing you the best interviews right here from the ground on Proof of Talk. We are going to be taking a short break, and we'll be back with our next interview. I'm chatting to Austin Federa from D0ero. A lot of you will know him from his previous role at the Salana Foundation. He's someone we've spoken to a lot. Really looking forward to that conversation. So, we'll be back in a few minutes time. Keep it locked here on Cointelegraph. Thank you very much.\n[Music]\n",
