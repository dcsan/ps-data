Why did this cycle end?\" It will probably be tied to these treasury companies in some way.\n\nIn this video, we'll explore the secret behind the meteoric rise of Bitcoin treasury companies, how they are affecting Bitcoin's price, and whether it could all come crashing down. Before we start, just a quick disclaimer. This video is not financial advice. It's for educational purposes only. I'm Giovanni. Let's dive in.\n\nMicroStrategy, recently renamed Strategy, started accumulating Bitcoin as a treasury asset 5 years ago. It was a risky bet, but one that turned out to be wildly successful. Today, Strategy holds over 590,000 BTC worth more than 60 billion. Its stock has outperformed Bitcoin, making it one of the top performing companies in the world. A turning point came with Donald Trump's re-election last year, which brought unprecedented political support for crypto. Since then, there's been a sharp uptick in companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Today, around 130 publicly traded companies have added Bitcoin to their treasuries, and that number keeps growing. Many of these companies are following a version of Michael Saylor's playbook: raise capital, use the proceeds to buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin goes up, the company's stock goes up, raise more capital to buy more Bitcoin, and repeat.\n\nBut how do these companies raise money? Well, there are two main ways. First, by issuing shares. That means selling a portion of the company to investors in exchange for cash, which they then use to buy Bitcoin. Second, by issuing convertible bonds. These are long-term loans that can either be paid back in cash or converted into company stock later, depending on how the stock performs. For example, imagine a company borrows $1 million by issuing a convertible bond. If the company's stock performs well, the lender might choose to convert that bond into shares, essentially getting equity in a now more valuable company. But if the stock underperforms, the company simply pays back the loan in cash like a traditional bond.\n\nNow, normally issuing more shares should hurt shareholders. It's called dilution, meaning each share represents a smaller piece of the company, but with Bitcoin treasury companies, it's different. What really matters here is the Bitcoin per share ratio, the amount of Bitcoin backing each share. If that number rises, shareholders actually gain exposure to more Bitcoin despite the dilution. If you own 10% of Coca-Cola and you're Warren Buffett and Coca-Cola doubles its shares outstanding, you don't like it. You own less of the business.\n\nYeah. But for MicroStrategy shareholders or Metapan shareholders, you want more Bitcoin, right? So when there's a dilution event and then the proceeds are recycled back into BTC, you own more BTC per share.\n\nSo why are these companies stocks so attractive to investors? Well, because they trade like leveraged Bitcoin plays. That means their stock prices tend to move even more than Bitcoin's price. And that's because these companies don't just hold Bitcoin, they borrow money or issue shares to buy even more of it. By the way, if you are enjoying the video so far, give it a like and subscribe to our channel for more similar content.\n\nThink about it. A company that doesn't need to sell a product, just issue more shares or debt, buy Bitcoin, and watch its stock price rise. This type of financial engineering has been called infinite money glitch. Some say this is too good to be true. Someone even compared strategy to the infamous Teral Luna scheme. But that comparison is misleading. Teraluna was a circular system with no real asset underneath. When confidence collapsed, the whole thing imploded overnight. Bitcoin treasury companies by contrast hold actual Bitcoin, a decentralized scarce asset with real market value.\n\nThis type of thing has been going on in currency markets for a long time. You know, a carry trade where people will borrow in one currency that they perceive as weak and they'll they'll they'll, you know, use it to get another currency uh that is either higher yielding or likely to appreciate relative to the currency that they're borrowing. So much like you would borrow an emerging market currency and try to buy dollars. Um there are entities that are arbitrageing this by borrowing dollars and using it to buy a much uh harder asset uh in Bitcoin.\n\nStill, this model isn't without risk. These companies fund their Bitcoin purchases by borrowing money, meaning they are using leverage, and that in itself means risk. This playbook works beautifully when Bitcoin is going up and market sentiment is strong, as we've seen in recent months. But what happens when the next bare market hits? Except strategy, most of its copycats haven't weathered a full crypto winter. If Bitcoin crashes, they could end up underwater, which means they could be forced to sell their Bitcoin to cover their debts. And that could have unpredictable effects on the market.\n\nBitcoin has done 70 and negative 80% before and it can do it again. If your business model can't handle a negative 80% Bitcoin draw down, rework your business model right now. Analysts at Standard Chartered have warned that most of these newer companies bought Bitcoin at much higher prices than Strategy. If Bitcoin falls below $9,000, nearly half of them could be underwater. They say even a 22% drop from their average purchase price might trigger force selling. But other experts say the panic is overblown. They point out that most of these companies issue debt at very low interest rates and much of it isn't due for another two to three years. That should give them time to ride out short-term volatility without having to dump their Bitcoin.\n\nBut there is another concern. Most Bitcoin treasury companies trade at a premium, meaning their stock is valued higher than the Bitcoin they actually hold or their net asset value. For instance, a company could hold $100 million in Bitcoin while having $150 million in market cap. That means that investors are effectively paying $1.5 for every dollar of BTC. Why is that? Well, because the market is pricing in the company's future Bitcoin purchases, growth potential, and the convenience of gaining Bitcoin exposure through traditional stock markets.\n\nSo, the value of MicroStrategy is not the Bitcoin that is held on its balance sheet. We're paying him a premium because he has liquidity. He has a company with a strong balance sheet. He can develop new financial instruments that no one thought about. So you're paying a premium because you expect him to continue doing so.\n\nNow, many analysts agree that these valuation premiums aren't sustainable in the long term, especially in a bare market when the sentiment is low. As more companies enter the space and competition ramps up, those premiums are likely to shrink even further. And that's where a new risk emerges: to keep their stock prices elevated. Some companies might take on more aggressive strategies. For example, they could use their own shares as collateral to borrow money. They're going to bring on leverage. They're going to potentially do risky deals in order to beat the competition and maintain that premium shares in these companies that like certain trading desks for instance could see that as a safe form of of collateral to lend against.\n\nWe've seen how this can go wrong. Back in 2022, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a popular Bitcoin proxy, flipped from trading at a premium to a discount. Several crypto firms, including BlockFi and three arrows Capital, had used GBTC shares as collateral to borrow money. And when the discount widened, lenders issued margin calls. Those firms could admit them. Their positions were liquidated, and one by one, they collapsed. The shock waves rippled through the entire crypto market.\n\nIt doesn't take a lot of companies to do this. It only takes really one or two that want to find that edge. And if it's the wrong one or two companies, I I have concerns that it could just permeate and infect the rest of the crypto crypto ecosystem.\n\nSo, should we panic? The answer is no. At least for now. At the moment, there is no evidence that Bitcoin treasury companies are engaging in such dangerous practices. It remains a hypothetical risk, but one worth keeping an eye on.\n\nYou know, when we're kind of looking back and saying, why is there a bare market? Why did this cycle end? It will probably be tied to these treasury companies in some way. Uh, which is not to say that the treasury companies shouldn't be doing what they're doing. It's just that there's going to be some later or less savvy uh entities that that do it improperly and the leverage come backs to to hit them.\n\nOverall, the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies has so far been undeniably bullish. They have unlocked access to massive pools of capital that can't gain direct exposure to Bitcoin, and their steady accumulation has added strong-term buying pressure at a scale retail investors simply can't match. As a result, Standard Charted predicts Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2025 and half a million dollars by 2028.\n\nThat said, a deeper, more philosophical concern remains. Right now over 3% of the total Bitcoin supply is held by public companies and that number is growing fast. According to Swan Bitcoin CIO, as much as one-third of all Bitcoin could eventually be owned by corporations. To many that trend contradicts Bitcoin's original ethos as a decentralized and democratizing financial system.\n\nThese are the rich people trying to corner the market to get richer. It's almost like an like an inverse sort of short squeeze on people that haven't bought Bitcoin yet that perhaps they're not able to get they're not able to get it yet because they don't have the technology, they don't have access. It's a big part of the world.\n\nSo that raises the question, is Bitcoin losing its original purpose and slowly turning into the reserve asset of the corporate elites? Few weeks ago, we asked that very question to Jack Mers, CEO of 21 among the leading Bitcoin treasury companies. Here is what he had to say.\n\nI don't think Bitcoin disrupts corporations. I think society will be filled with businesses that sell you a service that you value and you're willing to pay for. And so it's a truly free market. You don't have to buy my stock or use my products if you don't want to. But if you find them valuable, you're more than welcome to.\n\nLike it or not, that's how capitalism works. Bitcoin treasury companies are inevitably reshaping the very identity of Bitcoin from a decentralized currency for the people to an institutional reserve asset. Their steady accumulation is creating a strong non-speculative demand base, a clear positive for Bitcoin's price and its legitimacy. But as more companies follow the same playbook, the systemic risks could grow, too.\n\nThat's it for today's video. What do you think? Are Bitcoin Treasury companies a net good for the Bitcoin space?
