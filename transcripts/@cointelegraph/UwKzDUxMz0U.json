  "cleanText": "Good afternoon everyone. Uh, welcome to Proof of Talk in Paris. My name is Gareth Jenson. I'm the head of multimedia here at COINTELEGRAPH, and it's a great pleasure to be live streaming from the event. Um, next to me, I've got Jacob Robert Steeves, who's the co-founder of Bittensor. Um, before we get started with our conversation, I just want to invite you, the viewer out there, to drop your questions in the comment section below. Whether you're watching us on X or on YouTube, any questions you want to know about Bittensor, about Tao, now is your chance to ask Jacob. So, please throw your questions in the comments, and uh, we look forward to posing some of those questions towards the end of this 20-minute conversation. And we're going to have to keep it short and sharp because I've got a panel at 2:00 sharp. So, we're going to have a quick 20-minute conversation about Bittensor and uh, a quick overview of proof of talk. Jacob, it's great to meet you. It's great to chat to you in person. Um, let's start off with a philosophical question. Why did you build Bittensor? What does it solve? What does it prove? And uh, yeah, why does the world need this technology, especially when we're seeing AI tools develop as quickly as they are? I think a good way to get into that is with a story. Um, when I was at Google, I was working in AI at Google, and I ended up working for a team that uh, it's called Google Brain. Uh, it's like the highest level, the pinnacle of it's like the brain of Google, you know, and I was I was asked to work on a project, um, and the goal of the project was to generate images that would go into the watermarks, so like behind, not able to be seen of advertisements, to manipulate people's uh, likelihood to click on the ad. Um, and so it's like massive subliminal messaging. Um, gray area, right? It's like, is that legal? Is that not legal? Like, I don't think that our legal structures are even capable of really measuring that. Um, and I I kind of think that that was wrong. Yeah. Um, and you know, these types of problems stem from um, really the structure that you have a technology inside. So, Google as a corporation is a structure, um, where there are clear incentives for how people move and how those people control commodities and how they control compute and how they they follow out their careers and how they make money. Uh, and it makes them ultimately, it makes corporations become um, you know, at first the heroes and then the villains, uh, because they have a fidiciary responsibility, uh, and they need to maximize as much uh, money they can make per quarter, and so you get these types of, I not say nefarious, but like questionable ethical decisions that happen in corporations just as a consequence of like, hey, look, bro, I'm part of a system, and this is how I'm going to feed my kids. Yeah.\nIt also points to, and and so like that's why I I think it's important that we actually build in the open, right? So, blockchain technology is about decentralization, but it's and decentralization, what does that actually entail? It means that a lot of people can can own some technology. It's sort of like democratically owned. It can, it's permissionless in the sense you can come to own it. Like, it's not something that's like above and beyond you. It's not something that's in a walled garden. You can access, control, run, participate in the system, but also decentralized systems have to be transparent. Mhm.\nLike, the the the clear structure of that incentive is is well understood, like a legal structure, like out in the open, right? You can you can investigate the structure of law in a government and see whether or not like that has a is going to have a good outcome for humanity. Not the case with technology. So, I think that it's it's it's essential for us to build this incredibly important technology out in the open so people can see and understand where the incentives are, so they can participate, so they can own. Um, you know, you can get kind of flowery with your language and say that like we're trying to reach some sort of symbiosis with the machine, right? Where like I I actually own this thing. I own this technology, um, viscerally, the machines work for me because I hold this token, right? And I can see how that is the case. Mhm. I think that that's quite beautiful because it allows people to really viscerally own something that could potentially have a lot of control over them, as you as my example was showing, like you, AIs can can manipulate our our our opinions quite easily, and and we're building this like secondary organ or organism, right? So, that's my vision, and but it's not the vision that you see coming out of Silicon Valley, um, where their vision is more safety angle. Yeah. Right. Like, like Claude, you listen to the CEOs of Claude and OpenAI, they want to control the technology as much as they can. Yes. Right. They they're not giving it away. They're they're aggregating the control, and and they're doing it because it's for your best interest, you know. Um, but is it? Probably not. Probably not. And and um, but they're going to give something back, and and like if you if you look at at the the language that Sam Altman is using about how he wants to fix the potential like um, issues and the social political issues that are arising out of technology that is taking people's jobs, he wants to institute something like a universal basic income. Yeah. Now we're in the crypto space, right? We we're missionaries here. We understand money. Yes. Right. And one of the things that we understand is is is fiat currency and how fiat currency is not a fair trade. Yeah. If I'm playing your game and you can just mint currency, you have all the control, and fiat currency isn't that valuable. And that's what we've just seen over the last 15 years of Bitcoin's life is we've seen people's people run towards truth, run towards a system which cannot be manipulated in the favor of the people that hold the keys. And so if we're talking about a technology of this much importance, we need to make sure that it it's not manipul.\nNow, people that are on the fear side, they want to sell you a vision of you need to watch out because oh no, the AIs are going to launch the nukes. Oh no, the AIs are going to take over the world, and it's going to be an iroot outcome. I don't think that's going to happen at all. Or at least if it does happen, we're talking a couple hundred years, and we're certainly going to go through something before that that per that period arises. And I think that it's something. Have you ever seen the movie Elysium? Yeah. I I think that that we're moving potentially into a world where uh, we have the nots uh, and the halves, and they basically have access to this technology. They have they have the first class access to the best machine learning models as they come out. They control it. All of at the end of the day, all of the value was acrewing to them, and they're giving you basically peanuts for a UBI with a with an orb, right?\nI I think that there's a lot of people that don't want that. And and me especially, um, I I I think that it is essential that we try to use the technology, the most liberating and freedom technology that we've ever invented, which is Bitcoin, and we merge it with the machine, right? We have affinity with the machines. We have uni unification. We have a form of like symbiosis, and we're not we're not afraid of them, but actually we just really control can control them and and and work with them. Yeah. Look, um, you mentioned Bitcoin being part of that puzzle. Maybe you can just give us a very brief explanation of what bit Bittensor is, how it works, why it has a native token like Tao, and why you didn't look to integrate something like Bitcoin for payment for payments. Well, I actually tried to build Bittensor off Bitcoin. I was going to try to use the Lightning Network. Okay. Um, originally, and but\nIf you look at what Bitcoin is, basically it's a supercomput that uses hashes to secure the network and secure the state. It it's a commodity system that uses that commodity to to to crystallize um its own token.\nAnd\nBitcoin is, if you go a little bit more abstract into what it is, it's a market.\nIt's a perfect market where anybody in around the world can plug themselves in and mine Bitcoin to secure the network. Mh. So we basically said what we said is that, hey, let's try to think about what that exactly is. Let's let's take that concept of the digital currency market and let's abstract it. Let's get down to the really nitty-gritty of what that means to have a bunch of nodes that do some work and that are validated. So, um, we we took that idea and we we basically built it's a proof of work, proof of stake mechanism that allows us to colllocate and organize in really, really, really, really, really efficient and hyperco competitive systems to to extract digital commodities that would be valuable for the production of AI. We thought, hey, like, look, we we know that there's this grand vision for, you know, decentralizing AI, but if your AI sucks, it doesn't matter if it's decentralized.\nSo, so we knew that that part of the puzzle here was actually building something that could compete with centralized organizations in terms of just scale, raw scale and performance. So, you know, the reason we needed the token initially was because we needed to bootstrap the system, and we tried to use lightning. Mh. But lightning lightning doesn't catch any fire, and there's there's no market that can be created. So, yes, of course, we're we're taking advantage of the bootstrapping potential of using a digital currency in order to garner support and garner garner interest in the currency. And then we turn that whole thing into a commodity that's similar to Bitcoin. It has a specific value, and that value is the value of artificial intelligence, and it has a finite supply, right? I mean, it has a finite supply. So, we we knew like, hey, um, let's use let's use Bitcoin tokconomics because it's most understood in this industry, and and and I think it's the most fair. Was it a bit disappointing that you couldn't do it on Lightning? I mean, if you're a, you know, like you said to me off air, you're a bit of a Bitcoin maxi at heart. I I not to put you on the spot. Yeah. I mean, like I'm a Bitcoin maxi because, and I've said this before, I actually tweeted that it's like if if if it came down to I had to destroy Bittensor in my way, it's not very possible, but if I if I could, you know, to save Bitcoin, I would I would do that. Yeah. Because I you you what we're doing can't be achieved without the shield to the industry that is Bitcoin. Yeah. Um,\nI think that like the initial like the white paper's white paper is is is so seinal, it's it's almost religious. Um, and we we exist as like a continent on the inside of the world generated by Bitcoin rather than some sort of competitor. And like a lot of people that that are building cryptocurrencies are trying to go after Bitcoin. We're going to try to be better than Bitcoin. It's like no, no, no, Bitcoin is your friend. Bitcoin is Bitcoin is the United States, and you're a state inside of the Bitcoin universe. Um, so I don't think that it needs to be antagonistic in any way. People obviously will see it, and and I just want to say like when I first got into um, crypto and in in like early early days,\nthe toxic maximalist was something that I really, really liked because there was so much there was so much that you need. It's like a defense mechanism for the industry to help protect people against actual scams, right? Um, so, you know, we've built what we what we've built. We don't think it's antagonistic to Bitcoin. We think that we think that we actually um, really are are allies with that technology, uh, and and want to sit there in in its in its ecosystem. They're completely different things as well, right? Yours is a a decentralized machine learning protocol essentially, and Bitcoin is a monetary protocol. Um, I've got a question from uh, the live the the live stream comments. Please keep them coming through. Um, this is your chance to ask Jacob anything you want to you want to ask about Bittensor and Tao. Uh, the first one is pretty easy. What coins will be used in the future to buy groceries? Like realistically, is it going to be stable coins? Are we going to be using uh, you know, Bitcoin on Lightning? How do you see that playing out in the future to to buy groceries?\nUm, that's not the vision I really hold for crypto. I one of the best expressions I've heard about Bitcoin is like using Bitcoin to buy a coffee is like flying a fighter jet to the corner store. Yeah. You're you're talking about like geopolitical technology. It's it doesn't need to be used to buy a coffee. Like it's there will clearly be looser forms of currency that are used that are easier to like on Telegram, maybe it's Tao, who knows, or probably will remain national currencies, um, uh, in in these countries, and that will be a way that that you know, I think that we're actually teaching governments what money is, um, and and making them more evolved y in the way that they they they run their their local currencies. I think that Bitcoin will be the store of value, and that's all it needs to be. Yeah, it doesn't need to be I buy a coffee with it. So, which took and definitely not Tao. Definitely don't buy coffee with Tao. It doesn't make any sense. Yeah, for sure. I mean, look, there'd be a lot of Bitcoin um, payments advocates out there that would be like, you're wrong. It's also for payments. And I mean, like that's why we have lightning, but that's that's a discussion for another day. I want to go back to Bittensor and just talk about machine learning AI. How how does something like Bittensor and a decentralized protocol, a decentralized approach to this technology compete and overtake the chat GPTs, the Deep Seeks, the the Gros? Um, you know, how do you see that playing out? Do do you eventually see your your technology being able being the choice for people to use? Um, right. Or do they stay with a centralized option? So, recently Musk uh, at XAI, they went out and they just b\n\n\nOught this massive data center for like a billion dollars, um, and they started pumping out models like Grock, and they're reasonably competitive, right?\nYeah.\nThe reason they were able to do that is because they had so much money, and they were able to garner this data center, right?\nUm, I think that, I think that, um, in order to produce this like pinnacle element of intelligence, you need to focus on the like subcommodities that make it a reality.\nMhm.\nUh, so we set out to really break apart that problem.\nYou can't do decentralized training unless the compute that you're running on is decentralized.\nUm, or that's actually not true.\nSorry, I would actually say that that decentralized compute is best a product for decentralized training.\nAnd so Bittensor is a set of interlin hyperdigital commodity systems that interlink and allow us to actually scale horizontally at all those different layers of commodities that you need to get to these higher level order intelligences.\nSo we're at the point where we can create a data center with incentivization in-house that can get H100s or H200s at a cheaper price than these corporations.\nOkay.\nSo we want to scale that.\nThen we want to scale the technology that can use that compute because it's a different type of compute, right?\nIt's actually geographically decentralized compute.\nSo you need to have a market that can get all of those computers together and get them for the cheapest price, right?\nAnd then you need to put on top of that a decentralized training system that can use that compute, and that requires decentralized storage and bandwidth.\nSo that's another thing in Bittensor that we're building.\nSo we're really building up the stack, and we're getting to this point now where we're really making strides, like we're competing with these companies in certain verticals, and you know, we haven't yet trained the best-in-class models, but we're scaling our inferences faster than Google.\nYeah.\nWe're beating Google AutoML on gradients on subnet 56, right?\nWe, our storage pipelines are like Filecoin.\nThey scale infinitely, and we can get cheaper prices per gigabyte, right?\nSo all of that kind of comes together, and you can see just by analogy, right?\nSo how did XAI compete?\nWell, they just do a data center, and they put some machine learning engineers on the top of it, and then you can compete in this industry.\nWe're focusing on scraping out all of that inefficiency at each layer of the distributed infrastructure so that we can now focus on these higher order things.\nAnd so I actually talked on stage how I'm launching the sub that's going to focus on that.\nI'm going to focus on doing these very, the higher order machine learning problems like reinforcement learning.\nUm, and I think that's really where we're unstoppable, right?\nSo we're proving this point that we can scale bigger than you.\nAnd at a certain point they're going to have to look at us and go, \"Oh shit,\" like we're not the teams with the most amount of compute anymore, and so how do we compete?\nWell, you have to build Bittensor basically.\nWhat my other question to that then is, why does someone like Elon Musk not just go straight into it as well and realize what you're doing is far more valuable and far more powerful, um, than a centralized approach to doing it?\nWhy doesn't he do that?\nYeah.\nWhy, why, why don't they just take all the capital that they have and you know, deploy a load of subnets on Bittensor?\nI'd love it if they did.\nUm, they should, but I mean, like there's a lot of stigma towards the crypto industry in general, right?\nThere's been so much, Mhm, that, uh, you know, pumpf fun, you know, I'm sorry, like our industry has gone through, um, I think it really has a crisis, um, in terms of our mission and what we really stand for.\nUh, and you know, Bittensor is trying at every stage to change that by actually focusing on real technology, by research, releasing research papers, by showcasing real value, by making margins on decentralized technology, and yeah, they're going to start looking, right?\nBut we're miles ahead.\nI don't care if Google puts their compute on Bittensor, that's fantastic.\nI don't care if Google makes a subnet, fantastic.\nIt's why would I, why would I consider them to be an enemy?\nThey're not.\nThere are the, when we align ourselves with these protocols, and we, and by necessity, we have to do it in a transparent and fair way, we are actually reforming these industries to make them better.\nAnd so, um, yeah, I guess Elon could make his own decentralized technology.\nI mean, I think that he would have to hire a lot of my engineers, but, um, uh, maybe he can, um, but I think it'd be better just to join forces and work together.\nAnd, and so right now also in the industry, like that, that I think we've really stimulated the creation of decentralized artificial intelligence as an industry.\nWe're starting to see a lot of other projects come online.\nAnd my message to them is like, let's co-mine, like, let's work together.\nThe only way that we can really achieve this aim is if we do it together, and we don't see ourselves as an industry of antagonists.\nRight.\nYou said like, how do the Bitcoin Bitcoiners think about you launching another token?\nIt's like, well, you know, we're all just helping each other.\nYeah, right.\nLet's see it that way.\nYeah.\nI mean, uh, to me, that the two are very, very much different from each other.\nI've got another question from, uh, from the live stream from AI today.\nHow are you going to solve the security issue when AI start paying other AIs with Bitcoin?\nAnd how will storage be kept under control?\nStorage.\nOh, like privacy preserving storage.\nI think, I think, I think that's what it is.\nThat, that, that is how the question came to me.\nSo, um, you know, this is something that we're actually at the forefront of.\nUm, we have, I just want to say this, like one of the things that Bittensor has that's very cool is we're no longer a single company upgrading our protocol.\nWe built a mechanism so that the, the, that the people that are upgrading the protocol are actually highly incentivized to do it and are competing with each other to make progress.\nAnd so it's because of that, for instance, that we have, as soon as it was possible to do trusted execution environments, we had subnets doing it.\nAnd so what a trusted, trusted execution environment allows you to do is write a program that nobody can backdoor.\nThere's no man in the middle.\nAnd so you can run a machine learning model that you don't have to just trust, like, oh, well, I don't think they're, basically what I'm saying is, so we're going to have privacy that is actually more private than the corporations that are claiming privacy because we can actually say that cryptographically, right?\nSo this, this, there's a whole like, um, you know, Camber explosion of mechanisms on Bittensor that are using that all the way from storage, um, to model, um, inferencing.\nSo we're seeing that on Shoots, we're seeing that on Targon.\nUh, I think that they have, and Targon on summit 4 has the largest, like, co-located, um, set of GPUs that are doing trusted computing.\nFantastic, right?\nThese things are being really commoditized, and they're, and the technology is working with us to make it possible for us to compete at an application layer and say, like, oh, well, you know, the, it was before that enterprise would only use another corporation because they can trust a corporation.\nWhy would they trust the miners on Bittensor?\nWhich is a really good point.\nBut now we can say, \"Hey, well, why would you trust a corporation?\"\nMhm.\nWhy don't you just, why don't you just, why don't you just trust cryptography?\nDon't trust, verify, you know?\nSo, so I, I think that's, that's really, you know, what we're going to see in the next while.\nUm, I've got 10 minutes left before my next panel.\nSo, I would love to to keep going with this conversation.\nIt's been really great to chat to you, Jacob.\nI think, um, what, what, uh, people like you are doing for the industry is is really great.\nUh, it seems like a very selfless, um, approach and and something that's very dedicated to building important technologies.\nUm, if, if there was any parting thought that you could give our viewers out there in terms of decentralized AI, why they should explore using something like Bittensor or a number of other DPINs out there that have really great sort of approaches to this technology, uh, why should they be doing that instead of, you know, uh, pledging their compute, uh, to a centralized server or or service provider?\nThat's a good question.\nUm, you know, I, I, I, I think that, you know, we, we started doing this a very long time ago.\nUm, for the right reasons, and we made, we made, we made a point of not owning the entire thing, and I think that that's turned out to be a really important aspect for sure.\nYou know, it sets you apart from everyone else.\nOwn Bittensor.\nYeah.\nDon't come work for Bittensor, come own Bittensor.\nCome and be Bittensor.\nYeah, I, I'm like the foundation is being pulled out, you know.\nSo, I mean, look, look, there's, there's, there's brand, and maybe, maybe you don't want to be associated with with that brand, and that's, that's on you, right?\nTotally fine.\nBut I would say come and and actually build and take ownership.\nA good example would be Shoots on Bittensor, which has a, a, um, a subnet that's done very well.\nJohn, he showed up like a year ago, uh, and started building Shoots, uh, and his token value on his subnet is like 25% of Tao.\nThat means that he is going to come to own a massive share of this network, and when we launched this, like the sub subtokens, uh, the sub tokens on on Bittensor, we did it, the first sentence was like, how do we give more of this control away while maintaining property rights, but ensuring that that that new people can come and and really just like take my job.\nUm, and, uh, and I'm also going to be in there with you, right?\nSo, I just launched a subnet, so I'm, I'm down in the trenches, and you know, yeah, don't come compete because I want to beat you.\nYeah, there we go.\nJacob, thanks so much for your time.\nUm, we're going to wrap it up there.\nIf you want more information about Bittensor, go find them online.\nYou guys are on X, you're on all the social media plan, uh, platforms on their website.\nUh, we will continue live streaming from Proof of Talk today and tomorrow.\nSo, please keep an eye out on Cointelegraph's X account, our YouTube.\nThank you so much for for watching.\nSend your questions through if you have any burning questions, um, for, for our guests and panelists coming up.\nI won't tell you who we've got coming up later today cuz, uh, there, there's some really exciting names, and tomorrow we also have a great lineup of speakers joining us.\nSo, we'll catch you later.\nThanks so much for watching and see you soon.\n[Music]\n",
