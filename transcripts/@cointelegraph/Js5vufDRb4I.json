I'm very excited to chat to Reeve Collins, a man who's very well known for co-founding Tether. And I think we're just going to start the conversation there. Um, take us back in time. Tell us about the genesis story of Tether, how you started it, what it was then versus what it is now. Well, it's definitely quite a story, and it's really, really amazing to see where it's come and how it's just laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, and so just seeing that come to fruition does make me very proud. But, um, yeah, you have to rewind all the way back to 2013, which is when I first got into Bitcoin. And Brock Pierce was a good friend of mine, and you know, we used to hang out a lot, and I was just really wanted to dive into something new, and he's like, \"Look, you got to buy some Bitcoin.\" So I just really started getting into the space in 2013, and then a lot of discussions and a lot of time later, an idea came up, which was putting the dollar on the blockchain. Okay. Um, and back then there was only about five cryptocurrencies, and so it just, the whole market was maybe two to three billion dollars. So it was really small and nascent, but the concept is pretty straightforward. We had a new way to move money globally, instantly, and for free. Um, the problem at that point in time was the type of money we were moving was Bitcoin. So it was super unfamiliar. It was this new type of foreign currency based in code, and people just didn't get it. It was such a small amount of people trading it. But the blockchain, you know, really allowed you to do something unique and different, which was move that money and confirm those transactions. So the concept was format dollars, euros, yen to work on the blockchain. Just create that bridge, tether it to the dollar. And so that's how it rolled out. And then back then, you got to think, we were the first people to really tokenize any real-world asset. So we tokenized the dollar. And so we had to build the technology. And so Craig Sers was part of Mastercoin at that time. So he came on and co-founded it with us. Yeah. Sorry about that. Just turned off my phone. The rule is you have to take the call. And no, I'm joking. Um, anyways, and we really utilized Mastercoin, which is now Omni, to write messages to the Bitcoin blockchain and built that tech out, and then and really just put that out there, and that's when Bitfinex came in early on because they're the ones that had the first use case. So a lot of people didn't realize, \"Okay, great, it might be nice to move money around the world, but who needed to do it because they weren't using the blockchain yet?\" So the way it evolved was the exchanges wanted to settle their order books amongst each other, and then soon after that, you know, they also then they started listing it, and then the traders realized, \"Oh, I can, instead of pulling my money out of the system, I can just put it on the sidelines, but stay in the arena.\" Like, I can trade from Bitcoin into Tether on-chain dollars, and then from there, once the traders used it amongst themselves, it rolled into payments, yeah, because then they started paying other people, and then this was a slow rollout. It took about, you know, years and years for it to really start picking up. Um, but then the whole world started feeling the power of it, and really Tether itself as a company and an entity really took off in 2017 after we were gone. We sold it earlier on in the ICO boom, and I got to hand it to Paulo and the team there. I mean, they're extraordinary humans, and they've just done a really fantastic job. So again, I couldn't be more proud of where it's ended up. Um, if you are joining us on the live stream on X or YouTube, please feel free to drop some questions in for Reeve if you want to know about the genesis story of Tether, why you got out of Tether. It's up to you. We've got him here. We've got him here on the live stream. So, fire away with your questions, and we will ask them through the course of this conversation. And let's add some even more exciting questions about what I'm doing now, what I've done since, and where the future's going. There we go. Yeah, I do want to probe that very quickly. Um, the founding partner sold Tether right in 2015. Um, maybe my history is a little bit wrong. Why at the time did you make that decision, and all these years later, just considering how profitable a business is? You know, is there any lingering regret about that? Look, hindsight's always 2020, but we always live our lives, and we all do our best to live our lives with no regrets. So, I'm extremely proud of where it's come, what it's turned into, and the significant impact it's had on the world and how it's shifting the future of finance and how it's lifting people out of poverty and giving a lot of people a chance. And that's why also seeing Tether being moving its headquarters to El Salvador and focusing on Central and South America, those are the people that need it most. So, it's just, I mean, it still gives me chills just to see that impact that it's had. So, so it's amazing. But you have to rewind back to 2015. The market crashed. There was no business model. You have to realize what Tether's business model was, right? It's make money on the float. How much float was there? Especially back then, none. And and then it evolved into buying treasuries and other assets to back the currency. But the original promise of Tether, which they still hold true to this day, is, \"Give me a dollar, I put it in the bank, and I issue a token.\" So the elegance of its business model was in its simplicity. And that concept, putting a dollar on the blockchain, moving money globally, instantly for free, and democratizing access for the world to dollars, it's just, it was proven to be a super powerful concept. Um, so there are no regrets. There's just lots of pride, and I'm excited about building better, bigger, greater things in the future. Yeah, I mean, to think of Tether today, I've met Paulo many times, and we've had many, many very interesting conversations about their approach that it seems like they stumbled onto the easiest and best solutions when they started investing in Treasury bills, right? Because it's a stable yield over a long period of time, very, very low risk, fairly liquid, and I mean, to me, it's like, once they figured that out, it seems like everyone else will want to go and do that because it's such a smart move. Um, and it also allows them to generate profit off a business that would otherwise, like you said, just take a dollar and put it in the bank. Um, did you guys think that was part of the natural progression? Was it something you wanted to do back then, uh, invest in T-bills? Well, actually, it's like figure out how to maximize the value that we're holding without compromising the security and the backing of the currency. And so, yeah, those are definitely the natural progressions. And what's amazing about the space now is that it's evolving. So fast forward 10-plus years, and all these RWAs are coming on-chain, very high-quality, low, or very high-quality and low-risk assets that have decent yield, and those types of on-chain assets are going to be utilized as backing for stable coins. And there will be decentralized stable coins coming out because now that treasuries and other assets are on-chain, you don't need a centralized entity to be the one that buys your dollar, that buys your treasury, and then mints the token. So I'm rolled out a new company called stable.com, stbl.com. Um, we've been working on it for about almost a year now, and all of the infrastructure is in place to do exactly that, where the user can buy a treasury or another high-quality RWA and post it as collateral and mint their own stable coin. And when they do that, we strip the interest. We strip the yield into a separate token. And so the user gets to keep the yield and then push out the non-interest-bearing stable coin. So it's not a yield-bearing stable coin. So, it's not a security. Um, so there's going to be a lot of novel approaches to how the world utilizes stable coins. And right now, stable coins are it's the narrative, right? It's the vibe. Everyone's trying to create a stable coin and launch one. And there's a lot of reasons for it. The biggest one being the regulatory winds are at our back, whereas the, for until today, it was right in our face. So that allows institutions to really get in and governments and the rest of the world to really get involved and utilize both blockchain technology and these types of currencies to make their businesses better because that's the entire point of what we're doing, right? Blockchain technology makes businesses and transactions more efficient. It connects the world. However, you need basically government approval or at least a path to be able to do that. And now that's here. I've got a really great question here. I mean, there's always been a lot of controversy around Tether, especially between 2017 and 2020. Rugpull Max in the comments says, \"Rev, how much USDT did you print before there were any real reserves?\" I mean, this is a good chance to talk about some of the FUD over the years and how things actually worked. Look, all I can comment on is the FUD. It's insane, wasn't it? Just crazy. But it just goes to show that anyone who's at the top of anything and doing something revolutionary and on the cutting edge is always going to have haters, especially in our space. And they just want to tear you down for no other reason than there's just, there's such an easy way to do it now with online communications and social media that people just attack and attack and attack, and there was never any substance to that. And so Tether has proven over and over and over again that the backing's there, that the dollars are there, and that they're rock solid. And I used to always say, because people say, \"Oh, Tether doesn't hold its peg. It's lost its peg over here, lost its peg over there.\" Those are third-party exchanges. Those are the supply and demand on that particular venue. You can always go to Tether and redeem for the dollar. Um, they're one of the only companies that does that type of redemption. Yeah. Um, another question here. Call us ready. Um, uh, Tether, it's saying you, um, Reeve doesn't work. I'm no longer with Tether. I don't represent them. I just admire them. Um, but yeah. Um, it says Tether's planning to launch a new coin to comply with US and EU laws. Probably not EU yours, but I've spoken to Paulo, and they're looking at doing a sort of compliant new, uh, sort of USDT for the US market. Um, would that mean that existing USDT holders are forced to switch or you know, are unable to use those tokens going forward? So again, I don't know the nuances, but I can give you an opinion from a high level. I'm betting that they're all completely fungible because the regulatory oversight is probably really specifically directed at the where the value, where the backing is held, and who the custodians are, and what the type of backing it is. And so that flavor of Tether that's that has that regulatory backing can be whitelisted and sold to US customers, but once it's in the wild, it's in the wild, and I'd almost guarantee they're going to be completely fungible. My next question just a stable coins in general. Circle went public last week, like massive, massive valuation. Paulo went to, you know, New York for the first time this year, and, uh, you know, he said to me in private, like, \"We don't need, we, we don't want to be publicly listed. We don't need to be publicly listed,\" but it's very telling that the second biggest stable coin issuer company is now a publicly listed company. Do you view that as a natural progression of things? And is it good for the industry that a player like Circle is a publicly traded company? First, I feel it's definitely good for the industry. What's not good for the industry is if it stock tanks. Yes. But there's so much hype and so much pent-up demand to get involved in stable coins because all of retail or all of the people that really aren't in the crypto space, they hear about it, and then Circle comes out, and so they pile in, and it really drove the price up, and the fundamentals aren't quite there to support that level of price. So, as long as people understand that a lot of it is market irrationality and it's excitement, which is really great, but when the price goes down, it's not a reflection on the business or the capabilities of what stable coins have to offer. Let's talk a little bit about life after Tether. I mean, um, you, you're one of the founders of Pi Protocol, right? You're doing Weii now. Um, how has your approach changed to working in this industry? And before we speak about Bitcoin, because I really want to chat to you about Bitcoin. Sure. Yeah. So there's been a lot of life after Tether and a lot of interesting things. So after bringing the stable coin to market, the next big thing we rolled out was the first NFT. So we really champion, like, brought to market and pioneered the NFT before there was the word NFT, and that company was called Block V. We did an ICO, and we called them VAMS, like these highly programmable digital goods because we didn't, there was no word NFT for this, but we, we wanted you to be able to uniquely own a digital object. The challenge with NFTs is they got a bad rap because they had this massive run-up because everyone's speculating and gambling on images, but that's not really the best use case of NFTs. I still can't stress the importance of how much NFTs will impact our lives going forward because everyone's going to have a wallet. Those digital wallets are going to be filled with both tokens and currencies, but NFTs because NFTs are going to represent so many different facets of our life. So I created an extraordinarily robust technology platform, um, that's still in use today, like Visa, and then another company on top of that, Smart Media, and then Smart Media has done a\n\n\nDealt with Visa and Visa's utilizing all of this technology that BlockV built for their web 3 wallet in the loyalty space.\nSo that was a big chapter of my life and one that was also really exciting and impactful.\nAnd then, you know, and most recently, yeah, I launched a company called Pi Protocol, and that's what was rebranded to stable a few months ago.\nUm, stable.com because now there's another like stable that just came out.\nBut anyways, um, ours is stbl.com and and and but that's just the that's the evolution of the stable coin.\nIt's what I was talking about before.\nIt's bringing technology that delivers on the promise of web 3.\nAnd what's the promise of web 3?\nIt's that the users and the community and the people out there are the ones that reap the rewards and the benefits for participating in whatever service that platform provides.\nAnd and with stable, the users are the one that reap all the rewards.\nThey're the ones that receive all the the value from minting that stable coin and then utilizing it.\nUm and then in addition, so right now I'm I'm creating this ecosystem of companies to deliver both on the promise of blockchain and of web 3.\nAnd the other company is called WeFi.co, which is another really exciting company.\nAnd it's it's the first ever decentralized onchain bank.\nSo we call it a DEO bank, the evolution of the Neo Bank, which is just an online bank that still uses legacy rails to a decentralized onchain bank, a do.\nAnd that's Wei.\nSo it's just fully onchain and it packages all the familiar services you use like a card and loans, but also allows you access to DeFi.\nYeah.\nBut what's most exciting about these new types of financial services is that when you can in a very easy to use user-friendly way plug into DeFi and earn 10 plus percent on your savings account because it's topped up in stables and we do the hard stuff in the background to ensure that you get that level of uh return.\nIt's super valuable for the end user.\nSo Weii has built community first and really passing on all those rewards to the users.\nYeah.\nUm, this this ties into a question we just got from the live stream.\nAnthony Pomero said, um, you claim USDT in the US will be used like a checking account, but most Americans don't use stable coins.\nIs is it like fantasy hype?\nI think it's a good question, and it kind of touches on what the Genius Act and a few other things will enable stable coins to do in the US, like be able to give you a yield on your stable coin.\nAnd I I would imagine a future where people just stop using conventional banking rails and they just use a web 3 wallet and hold USDT and USDC and do those things.\nBut I'm not the expert.\nYou are.\nUm maybe you can answer that one.\nSo you bring up a great point and it's also nuance.\nI've got a few answers to that.\nStep one, the reason why this gentleman said, you know, users in the US don't use stable coins that much.\nIt's because we don't feel the pain.\nWe are the privileged, right?\nThose of us that live in these first world countries are privileged.\nThey have great financial services.\nWe're the minority on this planet.\nSo the rest of the world, again, why Tether is in Central and South America, they're the ones that feel the pain.\nThey're the ones that this is lifechanging.\nIt really makes a difference for them.\nSo you have to put a more global lens on to see how big of an impact it has there.\nBut back to the question of how big of an impact does it have in the US and the way you nuance it, it's like why would they use traditional financial rails when they can use a web 3 wallet and get higher yield?\nSoon and I think very soon there won't be traditional financial rails and a web 3 rails.\nThere'll be financial services.\nYou're going to log into whatever app it is that you use to log in and you're going to be able to do whatever it is you want to do.\nBut you're going to have better, quicker, cheaper services that provide higher yield because within that app you can hold dollars or stable coins and you have a choice.\nHold dollars and earn a half a percent on your checking account.\nHold stable coins just by clicking a button and earn 8%.\nYou know, it's it's going to be up to the user.\nAnd so then the use cases and the choices become pretty obvious of what you're going to use.\nAnd so more and more in the normal course of whatever financial transactions you want to do under the hood is all going to be run on blockchain rails because it's more efficient.\nYep.\nUm there's another question here from the live stream.\nUh CryptoCap 7398, that's a weird username.\nUm, Tether's ties with Reeve Collins and US Commerce Secretary Howard Latnik raised some red flags.\nHow do they avoid conflicts of interest in the future?\nDo you think they'll be under a lot of scrutiny for for those those connections?\nWell, they've had a lot of scrutiny already.\nThey have been under the world's uh most intense microscope for years and years and you know a lot of companies especially in the US they feel a lot of scrutiny from the SEC and again I'm just speaking as an outsider but I would imagine that Tether has had not only scrutiny from the SEC but probably the equivalent body in all the other countries around the world so I mean they are probably as squeaky clean as one company can be because of the level of inscrutiny so how do they avoid the conflicts they just they're experts at it I would guess um my my Next question.\nI want to I want to tie it a bit to to Bitcoin.\nUm I do have a question here from the Let's take this question from the live stream very quickly.\nUh does the Genius Act KYC requirement mean that Tether will collect user ids and other data and could that impact how people view and use USDT?\nUh if you have any thoughts.\nAgain, the only detail, the only commentary I could make on that is I would assume that as you mentioned earlier, if Tether is thinking about launching a US regulated stable coin and that was part of the regulation, then that US regulated stable coin would do whatever that regulation requires it to do.\nYeah.\nYep.\nThat's it.\nI mean, I I spoke to Paulo um about a month ago in Dubai at token 2049 and we spoke about Europe and why he didn't want to adhere with Mika regulations and it's it's fascinating.\nHe basically said not a lot of people understand the regulation and if you're a stable coin uh issuer in Europe and you have to uh you know abide by Mika's rules, you will have to keep all of your reserves in cash in a number of different small or banks.\nBut the problem is none of the big banks want to bank a stable coin issuer like Tether.\nSo you have to go to smaller banks.\nThese banks, a lot of them run fractional reserve systems.\nYou expose your users to systemic risk.\nAnd Paulo basically said if I don't have to if that means I don't serve Europe and you can't use USDT in Europe, I'm okay with that because Europeans and Americans are privileged when it comes to payment systems.\nWhereas developing nations need uh systems that hold value and we can transact very quickly.\nSo I think that adds a little bit more nuance to to that question in particular.\nLet's talk about Bitcoin.\nUh one of I I'm I'm a bit of a Bitcoin maxi myself.\nI think a lot of the conversations I've had with some Bitcoin maxis when it comes to USDT and Tether in particular is um it's it's kind of helping US dollar hedgemony and at some stage is that going to become a conflict of interest if we're all trying to get people to use Bitcoin and maybe see it go back to being more of a payment system than a store of value as it's widely regarded today.\nI fundamentally don't believe that Bitcoin will ever truly be a payment system.\nOkay, it maybe it's a Bitcoin backed stable coin and and that Bitcoin is using delta neutral hedging strategies similar to Athena and similar strategies, but Bitcoin itself will never be a pay like why would you ever have anything that's volatile be a payment system, right?\nSo, so, so I, yeah, Bitcoin is going to be a store of value and it'll have some other uses, but but really again, digital go, it's called digital gold for a reason because that's the closest thing to it.\nI think uh I spoke to Adam back about this in in Las Vegas two weeks ago, and he he said this is something that Hellf said was going to happen like on the second day of the Bitcoin network.\nYou know, it's Bitcoin is going to end up being the global reserve and and everyone's going to build a couple of layers on top of that.\nUm, the second question to that, uh, Elizabeth Stark and Lightning Labs are are very close to rolling out stable coins on Lightning, right?\nWhich I think is another interesting implementation because it takes things back to Bitcoin.\nUh, it ties into the security assumptions you get from the Bitcoin network.\nI mean, do we need to do that?\nI in my mind US Tether does it so well that everyone else is playing catch-up and the infrastructure you don't need newer infrastructure to do stable coins because it's perfectly good.\nWhat are your thoughts on that?\nWell, hopefully you have a different view.\nThere's there's always going to be new infrastructure, new entrance and new people trying to chip away at the market leaders and and and enter into a space.\nAnd it's healthy.\nIt's healthy competition because in the end of the day, who wins?\nIt's the consumer.\nThat's that's what competition brings is better products and better services.\nSo, it's just inevitable.\nThe last point that I want to touch on, um, Bitcoin Treasury Reserve companies.\nYou said you could say something about what you're doing in the space.\nMaybe you want to start with that and then I'll ask you a few questions about strategy, Made Planet 21, Nakamoto, all these big bigname Bitcoin treasury reserves.\nYes.\nA couple weeks ago, there was an announcement that uh I partnered with Chin Shu at CC Capital and we acquired a spa.\nAnd so that spa is um going to find a target in the space that is doing digital assets.\nAnd so we're bringing together another digital asset treasury play and we're very excited about it and there'll be a lot more news on that coming soon.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo we can read between the lines there.\nIt's following in in a similar vein.\nYeah.\nSo so we put it out there.\nWe're excited about it and and it's really the future.\nWhat to to bring it full circle.\nIt's so crazy that, you know, a lot of people from the crypto space are now diving in so deeply into the traditional world, but this is just a signal of the merging kind of what I said before of of of crypto finance and and traditional finance all merging and and the fact that crypto companies and digital asset plays are coming or going public and things like that.\nIt's just merging everything and getting the rest of the world involved in the crypto space.\nYeah.\nUm yeah, I I think uh a final question just on the Bitcoin uh treasury company like what are the risks in your mind?\nUm because strategy has held up really really well and you've got another a load of newcomers offering convertible notes.\nMade a planet is a whole another story just because of the how it works in Japan but do you see some systemic risks and will there be some failures in the next 5 years?\nI mean there's always going to be failures in in every new kind of approach to whatever problem it is that people are trying to solve or service they're trying to offer and and and yes there are some risks and the risks are people getting too clever.\nSo think of FTX and or not actually not FTX that's more fraud.\nLet's think of Terral Luna which which was just I would say too clever right they they they felt that they could like artificially inflate and create this algorithmic stable coin and pump it up.\nUm, so what I'm saying by too clever in these public markets, people get overleveraged and they'll use some poor choices of the way they set up their convertible notes and the debt and it can really unwind and force that company to liquidate everything.\nAnd so the investors in those companies might go down based on poor management and poor decisions.\nYeah, and that's exactly what Dylan said to me from Ad Planet a few weeks ago.\nUm, thanks so much for your time, Reeve.\nIt was really great to to chat to you.\nIf you have any more questions, you can find Reeve online.\nUh he's doing a lot of amazing stuff in the space and he's one of the people we have to thank for for Tether and USDT and a really fantastic piece of financial infrastructure.\nSo, thanks so much for your time.\nUh keep an eye on COINTELEGRAPH social media throughout the day.\nWe will be live again on X and YouTube right here from Proof of Talk to some of the biggest names in the industry that are here at this conference.\nWe'll catch you again shortly.\nThank you very much.\nThank you.\nCheers.\nThanks, Reeve.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
