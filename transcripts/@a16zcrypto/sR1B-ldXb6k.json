  "cleanText": "Welcome to Web 3 with a16z crypto, your\nguide to the future of the internet. I'm\nRobert Hackett. Today's episode is a\nspecial one. It's a roundt on some of\nthe most compelling ideas at the\nintersection of AI and crypto sourced\nfrom members of the a16z crypto team.\nToday you're going to hear from\nbuilders, researchers, and dealmakers\nwho are all wrestling with the big\nquestion. How will these two powerful\ntechnologies collide? And what happens\nwhen they do? First, deal partner Sam\nBroner makes the case for giving AI\nagents universal identities. Then,\nresearch partner Scott Kominers\npresents how crypto can provide AI with\nlevels and layers of rich context.\nYou'll also hear from deal partners\nElizabeth Harkavy on AI monetization\nmodels, Carra Wu on the next evolution\nof web crawlers, Jay Drain on proving\npersonhood online, and finally, security\nengineer Matt Gleason on how crypto\nturns internet advertising models on\ntheir head. This is a tour of big fresh\nideas that hint at what an internet of\nthe near future could look like. For the\nfull list of ideas, check out our recent\nAI crypto crossovers package, which you\ncan find at a16z.com.\nAs a reminder, none of the content\nshould be taken as investment, business,\nlegal, or tax advice. Please see\na16z.com/disclosures\nfor more important information,\nincluding a link to a list of our\ninvestments.\nAll right, Sam. So, your contribution to\nthis AI and crypto use cases piece was\nthat agents should have universal\nidentity. What do you mean by that?\nI think that when you go to a\ntraditional application, you go to the\nwebsite or you go to the app on your\nphone, you log in and you see your stuff\nthere. But what happens when you're\nworking with an agent that might show up\nin its own app, but also on Slack or on\na phone call, over email, over\ntext? It gets a lot harder to know when\nyou're interacting with an agent with\nthe right context and right capabilities\nand that you're authorized against. And\nso a universal identity for agents is a\nway of expressing this like a unique\nuniform resource identifier, but it's not\nreally rich enough. And so like how do\nyou do payments? How do you list\ncapabilities? How do you share state?\nAnd so, um, we start to make this point\nin longer strokes in that piece.\nSo talk to me, talk to me about why this\nis important. Why does it matter that an\nagent should have an identity of its\nown?\nAgent state is not quite like\ntraditional app state. You want to talk\nto a certain model, a certain LLM. You\nwant to talk to a certain context. What\ndoes the agent know about you? You want\nto talk to a certain set of\ncapabilities. And all that wrapped\ntogether is what we think of as an\nagent. And I think that to connect with\nan agent like that, you're going to need\nto be able to identify in a way that is\nricher than with websites. Let me give\nan example. Uh, so if you want to book a\nhotel today, you might go to a\nkayak.com or some other aggregator. But\nwhat if you want to book a whole trip and\nyou want to do it with an agent? Well,\nyou might text the agent and say, \"Oh,\nfind me a nice hotel in Paris. You might\ngo to the agent's website to look at\npictures of the agent. And you might,\nyou might call the agent.\" And for each\nof these three interactions, ideally,\nyou're talking to the same agent that\nremembers all of the rest of the context\nbefore. You could even imagine a\nsituation where you're in another app\nlike you're maybe on your workplace\nSlack. Maybe you're sitting in a\nthird-party application looking at like\nfood recommendations and you want to\nbring that same agent into the context.\nThat's a really rich interaction and you\nneed a way of universally identifying\nand then locating that agent so that you\ncan bring it into whatever context\nyou're working in even though you talk\nto it in multiple places. So, just to\nmake this really concrete for people,\nyou're giving this example of, you know,\nbooking a hotel, booking a trip, but\nyou're literally in Paris right now,\nsitting in a hotel room that you booked,\nand before we got on this call, you were\ntalking to our producer about food\nrecommendations in the city. So, this is\na very real problem that you are\nnavigating right now.\nOkay. Well, I want to go on a get a nice\ndinner with a good friend tomorrow\nnight. But I will say like I, I have the\ngood fortune to have a person that I can\ntalk to to help me book this restaurant.\nAnd I'll tell you what my experience is\nwith them. I'm sending them links. I've\ntalked to them on the phone. I've talked\nto them in person obviously and I've\ngot, you know, I've got Google's\nreservation window that I can look at.\nBut I'm sort of keeping track of all\nthis information myself. And the person\nthat I work with, this assistant, you\nknow, I know all the places I can\ncontact them. And for our agents, we\nprobably need a similar thing. We need a\nway of contacting them on any platform\nand sharing context with them while\nunderstanding their capabilities. And so\nfor friends, I know their capabilities\nare like when they're awake and sort of\nif they're by their laptop or by their\nphone because they'll tell me all that.\nBut for agents, we don't yet have a good\nway of expressing a set of capabilities\nlike that. What do they have access to?\nWhat do they know about me? Are they\nsleep deprived like I am right now cuz\nI got off a red eye last night? And you\nmight want to have an identity system\nthat supports that kind of richer\ninformation.\nSo you talk in your contribution about\nhow Amazon uses identifiers. It uses its\nown sort of spin on SKUs to identify\nproducts on their site and then in that\nway to tag their sort of like digital\nrepresentation to the real world. What\nis it about crypto that improves what we\nalready have? Most marketplaces have\nidentity as one of the core building\nblocks of identifying market\nparticipants. So you go on Amazon and\nyou see these different SKUs. Apple gives\neach app in the app store an ID. On\nFacebook, you have an identifier that\nsays who you are, but they don't expose\nthose very well. It's a little hard to\npull that out and use it in another\ncontext. We talk about this a lot with\nFarcaster, which is a crypto native\nsocial network where you can export your\nidentity and use it in other places\nbecause it's built on blockchain rails.\nAnd so for agents, one of the beautiful\nthings about them is that you can talk\nto them in multiple channels and with\nmultiple contexts. It would be such a\nshame if agents got an identity from\njust one aggregator from one extracted\nnetwork and then couldn't bring that\nidentity other places cuz I want to be\nable to talk to my agent on the phone,\nby email, in this app and in that app.\nAnd so I guess yes, we have identity\nother places, but we don't have the type\nof rich identity that we need for agents\nin a way that's available anywhere,\nanytime without the risk of someone\nbeing able to take it away from the\nagent. I'll add one more thing which is\nlike the agents I sort of am\nanthropomorphizing them really I'm\ntalking about the entrepreneurs like an\nentrepreneur builds an agent and this is\na new form of an application it's\nsomething that you can use and have be\nuseful to you and I don't want\nentrepreneurs to be beholden to a\nextractive marketplace which is like the\nonly place their agents can live when\nclearly agents deserve to live anywhere.\nThat's a core thing to think through is\nhow do we make sure this identity is\navailable for anyone to build on top of.\nSo really what I'm understanding here is\nit's not just that the agent should have\nidentity. It's really this concept of\nuniversality that is important. You want\nthat agent not to just be tied to one\nparticular service and you know\npotentially aligned with their interests\nover whoever else's. You want an agent\nthat is universally identifiable across\nall different services and can be used\nacross them.\nYeah, that's right. I mean the universal\nidentity for agents sometimes we'll call\nit more like a passport. You want the\nidentity to be there but you also want\nto know a little bit about the agent and\nmaybe you want to be able to stamp every\ntime you interact with it. So you want\nsomething that's a little bit richer\nthan DNS which is the domain name\nservice which is what underlies URLs and\nwebsites because you want it to be\nstateful and you want might want to be\nable to do payments over it. But this\nrich universal identity can be built on\nblockchains and I think likely should be\nbecause it guarantees that it'll be\npermissionlessly composable. It'll be\ncredibly neutral. It'll be accessible\nfrom anywhere in a way that traditional\nsystems don't guarantee.\nAnd by the way, while this is all\nhappening in the agent space, I think\nApple just enabled passports digitally\non iPhones. So you've got meat space in\none direction coming online and agents\ncoming in with passports on the other\nside.\nYeah. So let's just talk about that for\na second. So Apple is letting you host\nyour passport in Apple and that's like\nvery good but it happens because the\ngovernment is saying you all US citizens\ncan have a passport. It's sort of like\nhow Apple is required to load websites\non the phone. Like there is this\nresource that everyone has and can use\nand Apple is picking it up. And I'd like\nto see a similar thing for agents where\nyou have a universal identity that\npeople are using to describe agents and\nApple, Google, Meta all refer to that\nsame identity instead of them building\ntheir own in-house and forcing agent\ndevelopers to do complicated things to\nbridge the agents characteristics across\nplatforms or even worse being stuck\nwithin one platform and having sort of a\ntoll booth as you try to leave. So\nyou're pointing out that in the Apple\ncontext, it's really a top- down kind of\nsituation and maybe you would be looking\nmore for this bottoms up kind of thing\nwhere you could have agents get identity\nfrom all different sorts of places and\ncarry that wherever.\nYeah, that's right. And we're so early\nthat we have the opportunity. It's path\ndependent. Like there's a lot of ways\nagent identity could go. And right now\nbecause we're at a crossroads, I think\nwe should try to make an identity that\nworks well for the entrepreneurs that\nare building agents long term.\nOkay. Well, uh, thanks for joining us,\nSam.\nAll right, cool. Thanks.\nOkay, so Scott, you had a number of\ncontributions to this list. You\ndescribed four of your ideas as having\nto do with context, and the fifth one,\nwhich we'll get to afterward, you said\nhas to do with guardrails. So, let's\ntalk about the first four and how they\ncan all be lumped together with this\nidea of context in relation to AI. So\njust very quickly like there are many\ndifferent senses in which AI changes how\nmuch we need context and the types of\ncontext we need in our digital spaces.\nSo, for example, perhaps the simplest,\nyou know, everybody uh who has ever\nopened up ChatGpt or Claude or any of\nthese, you know, personal use AI systems\nhas probably had the experience of\nhaving to retach the AI a bunch of stuff\nthat you thought it knew about you\nbecause you had some interaction with it\nwhere you said, \"I code everything in\nPython. Please give me this code in\nPython.\" Or, \"I really, really, really\nlike this particular football team or\nsomething. Please tell me about this\nfootball team.\" or this is the type of\nmath I'm trying to learn. Any of these\nsorts of things, the second you open a\nnew shell, it's typically gone. This is\nsuch an issue that we're actually seeing\nbeginnings of marketplaces in stable\ncontext. You know, prompts that can cue\nthe AI to do a specific thing or bots\nthat you can rent that have specific\ncontextual frames that sort of save you\nthe trouble of teaching it how to draw\nanime characters or something like that.\nBut all of that should be able to\npersist and blockchains are a great tool\nfor that and perhaps the unique tool\nthat allows you to own your context,\nguarantee that it's interoperable. You\ncan take it from platform to platform\nand guarantee that it's forwards\ncompatible, that even the AIs that\nhaven't been built yet today will be\nable to interact with it and interpret\nit.\nThis is such a cool idea. What you're\ndescribing right now is that the status\nquo in AI is you have like the world's\nnicest, most eager butler except the\nbutler has amnesia and like constantly\nforgets things that are important about\nyour relationship.\nUm, exactly. And the thing that\nblockchains can bring to the equation is\nif they have one thing, they have\nmemory. like they are a database. They\ncan keep state. They have storage\nindefinitely well into the future and\nare they're hard to manipulate as well.\nSo you can be assured that that that\ndata is non-corrupted and accessible and\nhas integrity all that good stuff. Um,\nand that you have control\nand that you have control of\nof the data and where it's used and\neventually when we get there enough\nability to permission which applications\nsee which parts of it that you can\nchoose your contextual frame when you\nenter into an application.\nYou know, one question that I'd have\nabout this is despite blockchains being\ngreat at memory, you know, someone might\ncounter that.\nYeah, but they're not as efficient.\nWell, I was going to say they're they're\nkind of inefficient databases, you know,\nthey're really like do you need a\ndatabase of that capacity, you know,\nthat's sort of like global and has\nmemory persist forever like do you need\nto go whole hog in that direction\nor can you use like something quicker,\nmore efficient, you know, great\nquestion. So, I mean, so you may not\nwant this stuff to persist forever and\nindeed it could maybe, you know, drift\nor you could instruct it on when it\ndecays or or something of the sort and\ncertainly it's going to need to be\nupdatable, right? Maybe you are really\ninto Python and then you discover Scheme\nand you're like, \"Oh my gosh, why was I\nnot always coding in scheme and so you\nneed to like modify the context frame\nthat you're carrying with you?\" But it's\nreally important if we're going to have\nsort of an individually controlled\ncontext system, that system has to be\ninteroperable and it has to be sort of\naccessible to any AI application that\ngets created, even ones that don't exist\nyet, right? has to have sort of a a\npublic API that is standardized and\nforwards compatible, right? That it can\nbe adapted for any system that comes out\nrather than just sort of being built for\nthe form factor of whatever exists\ntoday. And blockchains are basically the\nonly technology we have that does this\nthat allows you to commit to\ninteroperability and that creates\neverything within a framework of public\nstandards that are forwards compatible.\nSo, let's dip into each of these ideas\nand how they relate to context. Okay,\nlet me just jump right from where we\nwere to proof of personhood. Jay and I\nwrote a piece about proof of personhood.\nAnd the takeaway there is that forwards\ncompatibility and commitment to\ninteroperability are essential for any\n\n\nSort of individual identifier, right?\nJust like your driver's license, you\nneed to be able to present it to anybody\nwho can verify that it's a driver's\nlicense and say, \"This is my proof of\nID.\" And you need to, for example, be\nable to present it to a restaurant to\nprove your age. Maybe even if the\nrestaurant was not built when you got\nyour driver's license. That's forwards\ncompatibility. So for exactly the same\nreasons you need this for your context,\nyou're going to carry from application\nto application. You need this for your\nidentifiers, your proof of humanity, and\nyour proof of who you are.\nGot it. Okay. So that's the first case.\nYou also wrote a piece with Sam Broner\nabout Vibe Coding and making sure that\nsoftware that you create on a whim or\nwhatever can stay up to date and doesn't\nget broken.\nExactly. So there's a stack of context\nhierarchy here. So we were first talking\nabout your personal context for your\ninteraction with applications. The\nsecond one is global context about you.\nSo you control your contextual\ninformation to every other application\nabout who you are and so forth. But also\nwhen you're Vibe Coding or otherwise\nusing AI to build software, you know,\nthe feature of this technology is\nenabling people to write custom\nworkflows and code even if they've never\nstudied programming before or and may\nnot even know exactly what the system's\ndoing, right? You know, they're\nappealing to an AI to do all the like\nlibrary extensions and connections and\nthings for them to produce the thing\nthey want. That's a huge feature. That's\nthe superpower of AI coding. But it has\nthe challenge that you're introducing\ntwo types of entropy. You're both\nbuilding entropy into your programs.\nYou're sort of adding things into your\nprograms that you yourself may not\nunderstand and that the AI may not\nentirely understand. You added them in\nbecause they sort of predicted that they\nshould go there. And they might work,\nbut it might be that neither you nor the\nAI knows why. And you're introducing\nentropy relative to everybody else. You\nmight have a program that fills out\nbilling slips and your colleague might\nhave a program that fills out billing\nslips that you both Vibe Coded up and\nthey're totally different from each\nother and they're producing output that\ndoesn't interoperate with whoever in the\nuh billing department is processing the\nbilling slips.\nThey wrote their own vibecoded workflow\nand it doesn't work with yours. And so\nwhat Sam and I describe are what we call\nsynchrony layers. Basically like\nprotocol layers that get wrapped in sort\nof like we have with software libraries\ntoday, but software libraries are updated\nvery infrequently, right? A software\nlibrary, you know, you put out the next\nrelease and then maybe people suggest\nthings over a 6 to 12 month period and\nthen you get another release. Maybe here\nwhat we need are fully dynamic layers\nthat both establish boundaries and\nupdates within your software and you\nknow, standardizations across different\npeople's vibecoded software so that you\ncan be sure that you haven't somehow\nabsorbed malicious code and so that\nother people can be sure that they can\nwork with what you're creating and vice\nversa. And so that's like shared\ncontext. We started with individual\npersonal context, individual global\ncontext. This is like individual but\nshared context.\nHave you Vibe Coded anything, Scott?\nOh, absolutely. I've most recently been\nusing this to create various forms of\npuzzles in the form of fully onchain\nSVGs and other sort of image structures,\nbut I've also used it in my research in\na bunch of different ways, right? Oh,\nokay. But the real triumph, here's a\ngreat example, by the way. Here's a\nplace where I have no idea how this\nworked. There is this conference that's\nthe top conference at the intersections\nof economics and computer science. And\nevery year when you have a paper\naccepted, you have to format the\nabstract or the paper in a particular\nway. And this year we had to make a very\nsubtle and complicated modification to\nthe formatting package. There was\nsomething wrong with the way it was\nprinting the co-authors of the papers\nnameline basically. And this thing is in\nunreadable code. And so we vibecoded a\nscript to fix this code to do what we\nwanted it to do. And like it was\nmagical. But for example, we then had to\ntake this product, right? We took our\nfinal source code and shipped it to the\npublisher. The publisher has the\noriginal version of the library, not\nours. And so when they send us back the\npage proof or whatever, we're going to\nhave to check to make sure that they\ndidn't break this thing that we fixed.\nAnd that's a place where a synchrony\nlayer would be useful. Like if they have\nreference to the fact that we've made\nthis change to the library file, then we\ncould be confident that they wouldn't\nrecompile our abstract and get something\ndifferent.\nI don't know if this is directly\napplicable, but I Vibe Coded myself a\nhabit tracking app. And what would be\nvery cool is if I could have friends of\nmine, you know, have their own instances\nof the app so we could track our streaks\nand like compete against one another.\nOh my gosh, that'd be epic. But yeah, it\nwould be helpful to have that kind of\nshared state that we can all rely on.\nExactly. And this again shared state,\nyou know, the second you say shared\nstate, Blockchain suddenly makes sense,\nright? Like you're like here's an\ninstance where you're trying to share\ninformation. You're trying to create\nsort of like a local shared state among\na bunch of individuals. And that's\nexactly what Blockchains are good at. So\nthen the last step of the hierarchy, in\nsome sense, the most global is when you\nactually have to establish global\ncontext. Here we're talking about\nregistries. And you can think registry\nof deeds. You can think registry of\nmembership in a I don't know, famous\nfancy society or something like and in\nthe roundup I wrote about registry of\nintellectual property. And the registry\nof intellectual property is particularly\nimportant as creative generative AI is\nleading to this explosion of remixes and\ntransformations and and the Internet has\nput pressure on intellectual property\nsince inception. But it's putting more\npressure on intellectual property at a\nvery accelerating pace than we've ever\nseen from digital technology before. And\nyou know the funny thing about it is it\ncould be a feature. Like there are all\nsorts of business models and we're\nstarting to see people experimenting\nwith business models around remixing and\nlicensing as the primary structure for\ncreative IP, but the existing\nintellectual property systems especially\nin the United States aren't configured\nin such a way that you can just interact\nwith them digitally and they certainly\naren't configured in a way which you can\njust establish provenance for something\noff the bat. In fact, we've seen\ninstances where where proven sort of\ngets reversed because somebody races to\nthe intellectual property system to\nregister ahead of the person who\nactually created it. And so again,\nBlockchains are a technology for\nestablishing immutable proof of\nprovenance with guaranteed\ninteroperability and that makes them\nideal for having public registries of\nthings like intellectual property and\nthen serving as the programmable layer.\nMy friends at Story Protocol, one of our\nportfolio companies, refer to\nprogrammable IP, that intellectual\nproperty should be directly accessible\nto the programming, the software layer.\nAnd that possibility is only just coming\nonline and it's awesome.\nWhat I love about your framing is the\nsuccessive ways that it zooms out. It\nstarts with me, proof of personhood. I\nwant to like bring my identity around.\nSo it starts with me then it goes to us\nthis sort of shared state concept and\nthen it goes to everybody like a global\nkind of shared state.\nExactly. And then in math we would say\nthe duel the space around the space we\njust structured\nare the guard rails around AI\ntransactions and actions. So I\npersonally believe that we're going to\nsee a huge marketplace of AIs\ninteracting with AIs without direct\nhuman oversight or supervision. I I\ndon't know exactly how long it's going\nto take to get there, but you know,\nyou're going to have an AI that's going\nout there. I I love Honkaku Mystery\nNovels.\nYes, I know this from our our reading\nlists where you\nevery reading list I have another\nHonkaku Mystery Novel. Honkaku Mystery\nNovels. They're these incredibly\nbeautifully written and very puzzly\nmystery novels from Japan. The the style\nis orthodox. Honkaku loosely translates\nto orthodox. And they're 100% fair play.\nAny clue that the detective sees, you\nsee. And so it really is a puzzle. You\nhave to figure out, okay, with what I've\nseen, how can I unravel this to explain\nthe mystery? I love these mysteries.\nEvery month or so, I scour the Internet\nto see which new ones have appeared in\nEnglish translation. I should have a\nbot. I would love to have a bot just\ndoing that for me without me just like\norder it for me. Like, you know, if it\nfinds one, order it from whoever the\npublisher is, have it shipped to me. I\nwould love to read it. I've read as many\nof them as I can find.\nThat's great. You could preload your\nwallet. Just give it a monthly\nallowance. you know, 20 US stable coins\nor whatever. And\nand and that's that's exactly it. In\norder for this to work, I have to have\nconfidence that the AI understands the\ntask that it can't be gained by somebody\nelse creating like, you know, hungu.net\nwhere they just send blank pages to\nsteal my money and that the AI can't\nspend my entire bank account if it\ndiscovers hungu.net, that doesn't\ndoesn't realize it's you know not real\nand you know sort of buys like 10,000\ncopies of books or something and then I\nget this huge empty book box and I'm\nthinking wow now there's a mystery in\norder for that to happen we need well-\ndefinfined payment rails and well-\ndefinfined guard rails for these agents\nto interact with each other and sort of\nend commerce sites or end applications\nand that again is something that\nBlockchains are ideally positioned for\nbecause they're about enabling you to\nmake immutable commit commments and make\nthose commitments part of the running of\na software process. You can basically\ntell an agent, you have access to this\nwallet, you have access to just these\nmemory areas and you have these search\ninstructions that you can't go outside\nof. Other than that, go find anything\nyou can.\nI think that's a perfect note to leave\noff on. This stuff needs some rules of\nthe road and Blockchains can provide it.\nGreat. Thank you so much for joining us,\nScott.\nThank you, Q.\nAll right, take care. So Liz, it's\nactually perfect to have you on next. We\njust spoke to Scott about some of his\nideas, including his last ones. He was\ntalking about sending an agent out to go\ndo his shopping for him, which seems\nlike a pretty natural segue into what\nyou were writing about, which is about\nhow Crypto in conjunction with AI Agents\ncould potentially help solve this\nmonetization issue that the web is\nfacing right now. So let's hear from\nyou. Describe your idea. Yeah. So this\ncame about through a number of\nconversations that we have internally\naround what is the next generation of\nthe contract of the Internet looked\nlike. You know the original Internet\nmonetizing this idea of attention mostly\nright? So we think about how Google came\nabout and SEO is you know I'll direct\ntraffic to your website in return you\nlet me surface your content on Google\nand this is kind of this fair exchange\nof sites get more traffic and Google\ngets to make a lot of money on on\nadvertising. And so what does the next\ngeneration of that look like? And the\nreason that we need a next generation is\nbecause that model has basically\ncollapsed now with, you know, nobody\nneeds to go visit websites anymore. You\ncan just get all the information you\nneed from an AI service or even Google\njust putting the information up there at\nthe top of the web page. They're AI\noverviews, I think they're called.\nYes, exactly. So, you no longer need to\nactually go visit the underlying site.\nYou can get these awesome summaries\neither through ChatGPT or through\nGoogle's onebox or perplexity or\nwhatever kind of tool you're using these\ndays. Because of that, you're kind of\nbreaking this economic contract of what\nis the purpose of putting that\ninformation out into the world for free\nas the underlying content site if you're\nnot getting anything in return. So, how\ndo you how do you fix that? And so I\nthink there's there's a couple of\ndifferent ways you can approach this and\ndifferent strategies people are taking\nfor how do you fix this monetization\neconomic model if we're no longer\ndirecting people to sites and how do you\nactually continue to incentivize new\ncontent and the longtail of content on\nthe Internet if we're breaking this\neconomic model. It might mean you know\nagents go out and just pay per data\npoint and they go out and as they need\nmore contacts they pay for it. The idea\nI walk through is this more fanciful\nidea of what would it look like to do\nrevenue sharing through transactions. In\nmy view, people have gotten pretty\naccustomed to the web being free. And it\nseems unlikely that they're willing to\nkind of fund these agents to go do\nsearch for them when it would be free\nfor them to go to Google or it's free\ntoday for them to use Google or\nPerplexity or these free versions of the\nagents. And so if people aren't willing\nto spend money upfront for the agent to\npay for the data, what else might this\nlook like? And so one idea that I I just\nkind of walked through is this idea of\ntransaction sharing between all the\ncontent sites and the end action. So you\nsend your agent out to shop for you. If\nit actually ends up buying something,\nthere's some sort of revenue share back\nto all the places that it got context\nfor that.\nAnd by the way, it's cliche to say that\nlike it's actually not free. You know,\nyou're paying with your data. But you\nknow, despite that being cliche, it is\nextremely true. The web, which seems\nfree, is monetized. it's just monetized\nin a way that you're not really seeing.\nAnd so even even if you're like, \"Oh,\nwell, how are we going to add in all\nthese transactions, these payments, and\nwhatever?\" The thing is, all these ad\nnetworks have all that there already.\nIt's just not in front of your face. So,\nit's not that radical a shift as one\nmight imagine.\nYeah, exactly. Today, you're basically\ndoing this exact same flow just with\nextra steps. So, you get served an ad\nwhen you go visit a content site. The\nidea being that at some point you will\nconvert on that ad and actually go buy\nsomething. And so the companies, the ad\nagencies, the people advertising are\nwilling to pay upfront for that ad\nassuming you will then convert into a\ntransaction. The idea is to make that\nprocess more more direct given that we\nno longer have this attention on the\nunderlying site. So instead of going to\nGoogle, getting routed to a site,\ngetting served an ad, possibly\nconverting on that ad and going and\nbuying something later down the line,\nthat happens all kind of in at one flow\nthrough of when that transaction occurs.\nEveryone involved in that transaction\ngets paid back automatically. And the\ngreat thing about that is that the\nattribution is actually possible to\n\n\nTrace because the agent is pulling in context in real time. And so it's not as kind of intangible as a human who might visit a million sites and see a billboard and see a friend talking about something and trying to attribute back why they actually bought something is a much more complex process than just attributing back what the agent used in its path to recommend that end transaction.\n\nSo what are the technical pieces that need to be in place for this to happen?\n\nYeah. So you need you need the ability to do these very complex splits of nano payments, which today is very challenging to impossible, given just the basic overhead of a single credit card transaction makes it infeasible to do these like a tenth of a cent or hundredth of a thousand of a cent transactions. And that's because there's just like a basic fee on a credit card transaction. I forget how much it is, like 30 cents or something, which immediately gets rid of any opportunity of doing anything beneath that that cost point. Exactly. And then you would also need to be able to do this attribution of what data and context is an agent pulling in. And then you would just need a way to actually pay that out. On Crypto rails, this is as simple as putting in the metadata wallet address that is paid out to every time you use the data. You could even guard it or pay wallet in that way just for agents to scrape it. But in the traditional financial world, this would be significantly harder to figure out how to actually pay each content provider, figure out a bank account or credit card number or how you actually get that money back to them. So yeah, need an ability to attribute where the data came from to do these small and complex payment splits and then actually be able to pay the underlying content creators. Do you think that we are going to get there in time before AI eats all the good information and sort of forces content creators to question whether they want to start publishing openly on the web?\n\nYeah, I mean I hope so. I think it's definitely feasible. It seems like today the direction we're mostly going in is remaining with the agent as the intermediary. So rather than you having this flowback effect or this revenue sharing effect, instead the agent companies like OpenAI or Anthropic or whoever are paying directly for access to this data through these big data deals with, you know, like Reddit or the New York Times or whoever. So then you you know, you're paying your monthly subscription to OpenAI, they're paying an annual subscription to the data provider, and then that data is surfaced in that agent. That does start to address this issue. But going down that path ends up with this kind of very siloed information where you are only going to get surfaced information on OpenAI with companies that OpenAI has signed deals with and you lose the openness of the web and especially you lose the longtail of individual content creators that can't get these partnerships with OpenAI and so their information is not surfaced the way that it might be today in Google where even if it's not promoted so it might be on the first page you can still always find any data you want and it kind of gives you this open access that these information silos might not. So, it feels like we're heading more and more in that direction, but hopefully we can make it a little bit more fair and open.\n\nExcellent. Well, speaking of fair and open, our website where you can read Elizabeth and the rest of these contributions is open, not paywalled. So, you can go read these posts there. Elizabeth, thanks so much for coming on and sharing your idea.\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nAll right, Cara. So, we just spoke to Elizabeth and she described her ideas for how AI agents could be monetized potentially or how content and data on the web could continue to be monetized such that like AI doesn't completely cannibalize the whole thing and how crypto can potentially offer the ability to do nano payments and other sorts of things to prevent the web from, as Chris would say, eating its own seed corn or corn seed or I don't know, some kind of farming reference. Seed corn. Okay. That's how you know he's from the Midwest.\n\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nSame.\n\nUm, so this actually kind of meshes quite perfectly with your contribution to the AI and Crypto ideas list here, which has to do with web crawlers. I'll just set context and say people hear the word AI agents and the word might sound kind of funky and new and buzzy whatever but like I love how you start off by saying that web crawlers which have been around for decades now are a kind of first example of this like a primitive AI agent that has existed on the web for a long time.\n\nYeah. So the reason I started thinking about this was because I did a panel last year on AI agent use cases. And at the time I said, you know, the only AI agents that have real product market fit are agents as entertainment and coding agents. And then I started thinking about it a little bit further after I left the stage and I was like, wait, I'm wrong. Actually, the AI agent that has the best product market fit isn't any of these new things. It's actually something that's been around since the very genesis of the Internet, so to speak, which is the web crawler, which is an agent that literally represent what we call a user agent, autonomously navigates the web, decides what data to collect, decides which links to follow, which paths to bark down, and then comes back and gathers that data on behalf of the user. Today, nearly half of all Internet traffic is nonhuman and, you know, is representing a user agent is like a bot or a web crawler.\n\nWow. So, the scales have tipped. The web is now more bot, more automated than it is human.\n\nYes. And that's why I say that this is the product with the best product market fit is just because the population like if you were to take a census of Internet activity like the users of CPU bandwidth or like compute for website hosting the vast majority of it is coming from non-human sources is coming from these AI agents. So whether or not you believe that to be product market fit the volume is sort of staggering. It used to be the case that you would only use a crawler for a small and constrained use case. Today, every single major company has an AI crawler. Whether it's Amazon using their crawlers to track pricing for vendors who also sell through their own channels in addition to on the Amazon marketplace or actually the most common crawler if you check in the network activity tab of any web page is usually Bytespider, which is Tik Tok's crawler.\n\nWow.\n\nWhich is feeding into the Tik Tok feeds to decide what is relevant for the algorithm. Yeah.\n\nSo, yeah. It's not just Google anymore. There are crawlers all over the place.\n\nThat's so interesting that Tik Tok actually has like the biggest crawler.\n\nYes. Yeah. It's they call it Bytes Spider. Every major Internet company has a special little name that is some derivative of their company name to represent their user agent web crawler. And the point is like, okay, so why why do these companies want to crawl the web? Well, Amazon wants to be able to penalize the merchants on its site that charge a lower price on their own first-party platform. So, they will literally downrank vendors that have their own firstparty sales channels and give favorable pricing to their own channels. And this is like a core part of how they design their algorithms today. Like their algorithms are not only trained on this data that they crawl and search for but also use it as real time data to like up and down rank they use it as part of their rag which is retrieval augmented generation so they use it real time both at inference time but then also in pre-training and post- training so this has now become a really important part. I think there's this idea that the Internet scale data that is accessible to common crawl is commoditized which it certainly is but it's also used at like every point in model generation both in the training and in the inference and at inference time. So this is like a really important piece of Internet infrastructure and what's really interesting is like yes the common crawl accessible data is becoming commoditized but it's also the case that an input to this problem is that the surface area of common crawl accessible content or like crawler accessible content has contracted dramatically because there's no incentive for creators to continue to supply that content to crawlers for free. And this was something that Chris and I wrote about in our blog post about Story Protocol about a year ago. We hypothesized that the social contract of the Internet was going to fall apart where creators are incentivized to provide their content for free so that platforms can index and then provide distribution back to them as a service. Right? That was like the original social contract of the Internet. Today, if the primary distribution engine and the way information gets surfaced is through LLMs, which do not provide attribution back to those original content sources, there's no incentive for creators to provide that content for free. So, what you see is increasingly things are put behind pay walls. But also, you can see in the open Cloudflare data that websites are choosing to just block crawlers altogether. Any crawler that is known to be associated with like an AI user agent can be blocked in one click on Cloudflare or any other hosting provider. And so about a year ago only about 9% of the top 10,000 websites were blocking AI crawlers. Today that number is around 37%. And so of course the closer you get to the top 100 websites, the numbers skew up dramatically because content is their business, right? So they're they're very aware of this fact. And then if you go to the top million sites, website owners are less proactive about this kind of blocking activity because they're just, you know, less savvy or less concerned about this distribution problem. In the last era of the web, there's been this sort of steady rise of people adopting ad blockers. But it sounds like in this current moment, this shift that we are seeing now into the AI sort of dominated web, this, you know, throwing up pay walls and putting crawl blockers up is happening much more quickly.\n\nYes. And and part of the reason this happens is because of course firms are more rational actors so to speak. Like firms are very quick to respond when they understand that the basis of their business is being disrupted.\n\nYeah. If it affects your bottom line, you're going to notice.\n\nYes. And firms are in general much quicker to act rationally than consumers are because they're very aware. You know, they have people doing analysis on what drives their bottom line.\n\nBasically, all of this is to say I've been thinking about how we've arrived at this sort of standstill. We are entering this data constrained world where it's not clear that models will be able to continue improving at the rate that they've been improving because supply of non-commoditized data and supply of common crawl accessible data is becoming increasingly constrained for all the reasons we've discussed. So that's on one side of the standstill. And then on the other side of the standstill, it's like, okay, if we're getting all of our information from LLMs, how do creators get distribution? Or how do people who are creating original content get attribution and get paid for providing the information that these models were supposedly trained off of? And I've been thinking like what if instead of you know website owners paying CDNs to outright block anyone who shows up and seems like they might be a bot, we met somewhere in the middle where AI bots could pay for the right to collect data in real time as they're visiting all of these websites and doing their crawling work. And this is where blockchains come in. In this scenario, every web crawler agent could have a little bit of crypto that they control and they might be able to engage in an onchain negotiation with the bouncer agent that represents a website and they might be able to do some sort of challenge or transaction or negotiation and decide, okay, this is like the auction price for collecting this kind of data on our site today. And you might be able to initiate that payment through an open protocol like X42, which was released by the Coinbase team. is like perfect for this use case. So that's that's the general idea. It's a kind of lofty thing and it's going to be very challenging of course because it requires a lot of different website owners to buy in, right? And you know at the very least it will require Cloudflare or some big CDN to get on board with this new standard which would essentially take the place of the robots exclusion standard which is how web crawlers get turned away today and that's how it's been since the '90s. So what you're describing is basically going from a world where we have these bespoke content licensing partnerships between you know some AI company and a content provider like say a major newspaper magazine or something where they strike a deal they give however many millions of dollars and they get the content in return to supply into their models. Instead of that world where you have these bespoke arrangements, you're talking about a world where you have a marketplace that is designed specifically for agents to come on board and negotiate these things in a more sort of automated way, in a standardized and automated way rather than a bespoke and kind of like custom way that we're seeing right now.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nI would maybe draw the analogy to say that we've actually seen something like this on the web before. Like the first banner ad was on hotwired.com. AT&T bought it and that was the first display banner ad. And then eventually from there we had the development of ad networks that take care of all this thing in the background at the blink of an eye. It became standardized, professionalized. And so maybe that is the exact sort of thing we're going to see with AI agents moving forward, right? And you can generalize this to be almost like an access control network and not just a web crawler network because I think one question emerges like how do you decide whether somebody is a bot or a real human like that's a prerequisite to being able to enforce this kind of standard or policy. And one challenge is that crawlers can spoof themselves as actual users. They can say that they are Mozilla X Firefox. they can pose as a user, as a real human on the Internet. And it can be very difficult to differentiate between a bot that claims that it's a user and an actual user. You sort of rely on the integrity of the bot creator to make a very helpful name like Bytes Spider to identify itself, right? I think the other thing is you would have to create a multi-lane highway to differentiate between humans and bots. And maybe the answer is that you just assume everyone's a bot unless they have some session cookie in their browser that says this is Cara's world ID and this is how you know that's a human. And it's also the case that you can imagine a world in which you have an agentic browser that has a notion of like who the user actually is that has a sense of the user's identity and then you might\n\n\nActually, I have a whole cohort of AI Agents that you can delegate different fine-grain access control passes to. So, one might be Carra Wu's authorized official representative that has access to all my bank accounts and can actually access websites as my user agent, but I might also have Cara Spider that is not an authorized representative of me, but has some money and can go pay to crawl other people's websites. Well, as you mentioned at the start of this conversation, the fact that more than half of internet traffic is now generated by bots, it seems like it would make sense to put the burden of proof on the user to have to show that they are in fact human. You might have to assume that everything is a bot and then use some proof of personhood to enable people to differentiate themselves.\n\nRight? The best-case scenario is we get into this world where everything is free for humans. You know, information wants to be free, media wants to be free. Let that be free for real eyeballs. And then everything is just extremely highly taxed for bots that are either representatives of firms and like have some sort of underlying economic incentive or like economic subsidy basically to go and browse the Internet.\n\nCara, thank you so much for your time. I could not ask for a better layup for our next conversation with Jay where we're talking about proof of personhood. So, thank you also for that.\n\nI aim to please. That's my job. It's almost like I work with these people.\n\nIncredible. All right. Well, thank you. Take care, Cara.\n\nThanks. Bye.\n\nAll right, Jay. Thanks for being with us.\n\nYeah, of course. Okay, so we just got off the line with Cara who was describing an Internet in which you've got a lane for humans and a lane for bots potentially, which kind of is the perfect setup for your idea on the AI and Crypto list, which is about proof of personhood. Tell us what you are putting forward.\n\nYeah, of course the context for what I wrote and what Scott Kominers and I wrote is AI and generative AI are like mindblowingly incredible but have massively increased the cognitive overload of using today's Internet. So consumers are constantly worried is the person that I'm interacting with real? Is the content that I'm consuming online real? Is it coming from the person that I think it's coming from? And products and services and companies have to worry about protecting users' trust and preserving valuable resources like compute or IP or data or bandwidth or customer support. And what we think the most credible solution to that is is proof of personhood which is a mechanism that enables anyone to prove to another app or service or human that they are a verifiably unique human being. And what it does, kind of like what Cara was mentioning, is it effectively divides the Internet into an Internet with human beings and agents and bots and an Internet that is exclusively for human beings and where all the services and the apps and the protocols on this side of the Internet or this lane of the Internet is just humans. And what's really exciting about that is we have decentralized proof of personhood mechanisms like World's Proof of Human or World ID.\n\nYeah, let's talk about this. So, World ID just launched in the US, which is a pretty big deal. And I think that's probably what people think of when they think of proof of personhood. They probably think of World ID first. When they think of decentralized proof of personhood specifically.\n\nYeah. Okay. So, tell us the difference.\n\nDecentralized proof of personhood is unique in that it's fully censorship resistant. It's secure. It's unstoppable. It can't be taken down by a centralized party or a government or entity. It's credibly neutral, meaning it's fully transparent. And there's not a gatekeeper that can discriminate in how an ID is issued unlike a passport which potentially you can get your passport taken away or even if we want to extend the idea of identity and talk about like a bank account you can get your bank account frozen. It can be denied, it can be frozen. It can be deemed invalid by some you know service or entity and decentralized proof of personhood is credibly neutral. Beyond that, it enables permissionless accessibility for developers or platforms. There's no centralized party that controls the access or approval or can block a certain use case or application. And perhaps most importantly, it's self-custodial, which means in some cases it's privacy preserving like World ID. And then users have full control over their identity, data, and have full autonomy over it as well.\n\nBut your idea here, it's not just about proof of personhood. It's about this idea of forward compatibility. Maybe you could zero in on that and explain what you mean there.\n\nYeah. So forwards compatibility or I think it's also often called like upwards compatibility. It means that the system can be updated and still work properly with any applications or services that want to work with that system or ID system.\n\nOkay. And that's important here because that is important here because centralized identity systems require an upgrade or update from a single party that controls the data or stores the data etc. And so here it is fully trustless for both users and developers and they don't have to think about the maintenance costs or overhead that comes with identity systems in the kind of centralized domain.\n\nGotcha. So people are probably pretty familiar with what World is doing. There was a Time magazine story. You know, the orb was on the cover. They've gotten pretty good coverage all over. But who else is working on this idea? Where else might people encounter it?\n\nThere's another decentralized proof of personhood startup called Self. And then there's a kind of similar protocol for verifiable credentials called the Solana at distestation service which is really new and they allow issuers to associate information like a KYC verification or geographic eligibility or accreditation status with a user's wallet. And so these attestations are signed, they're verifiable, and then users can take those across a number of different applications without exposing any of the sensitive data on chain or having to go through these verification steps over and over again.\n\nAmazing. And by the way, listeners, we just had Anatola Yakaveno on our podcast, so you can check out that episode. It's called the inside story of Solana. Jay, anything else you want to mention before we head on out?\n\nYeah, I'd say what's probably most exciting about this is that we are seeing a number of use cases for decentralized proof of personhood pop up both inside and outside of Crypto. I think inside of Crypto you see a lot of really cool protocols like Morpho which does lending offering exclusive lending rates to folks who are verified with a World ID. There is this kind of experiment around priority block space for people who are verified World ID holders. And then outside of Crypto, you have integrations with Match Group which allows them to add this like enhanced layer of trust for users and verify that users are above 18 without revealing any sensitive information. And you have integrations with Shopify where Shopify merchants lose a ton of money to bots that are stealing discounts or people that are spinning up fake emails to claim multiple discounts and they can offer discounts exclusively to people that have a World ID. So I think the acceleration of use cases both inside and outside of Crypto is really, really exciting for proof of personhood.\n\nThat's pretty awesome. It sounds like there is going to be a fast lane developed now maybe for humans and once the service that you're getting is so much more convenient or useful or quick or whatever that seems like a pretty good road to adoption and you see that even at airports you know I've got digital ID and breeze on past the security line makes it quite a nice experience. Jay, thanks so much for being here and sharing the idea.\n\nThanks Robert. Thanks for having me on, Matt. Hey, welcome. So, you are closing us out for our roundup of AI and Crypto-related ideas. I think we've all had the experience of having creepy ads chase us around the web. I recently visited a cavern and now I'm getting cavern-related content on Instagram. So, that's interesting. Tell me what you mean by making ads personalized and tailored but not creepy and how Crypto can in fact solve this problem.\n\nSo I think it's actually best to take a step back and to describe it in kind of two parts. So if we're envisioning what's happening in the ecosystem in Crypto, we're starting to get like really low fee transactions which basically mean money can flow really fast as well as some digital identity systems. So the ability to prove a person is a person. And we just talked about that with Jay actually who was on right before you.\n\nExactly. This is a little bit tangential to that which is the case of like what if we can start decentralizing basically recommendation engines. So with AI and AI agents especially with people trusting them can people either run their own or have people run their own on their behalf to kind of advocate for their own interests. So instead of you receiving ads for caverns because like you clicked on a cavern once, it happens to just know that like, hey, your car is getting kind of old and you're looking for a new one. And so it starts to like reach out, find ads for cars you would like, which are going to be very specific and tailored to you, and then starts to like go to the ad people and be like, \"Hey, I'd love to serve this ad to this guy, but how much will you pay me?\" And by it, it means you. So that's a really fascinating inversion on the way advertising works today. You know, right now, basically, you've got big companies that have to make all these guesses about who you are and what your needs might be based on your demographics or what little information they can glean about what kind of person you might be. But what you're describing is like, okay, I have an agent, and that agent happens to know that I bought my Subaru in like 2017, and you know, it's got however many miles on it, hundreds of thousands, and it's about time that we get an upgrade to a new car, something like that. So, it's this much more proactive kind of relationship with ads and advertising that even gives users more agency.\n\nYes. And then the Crypto aspect of it is more or less there's a big problem with like self-attested demographics and hey this person will definitely love this ad that is solved by identity zero knowledge proofs and then making it so they can actually pay you cuz like to view an ad no one's going to hand you like $100 usually they're going to hand you to view an ad you know maybe multiple cents and then like those transactions aren't feasible with high fees. systems. Imagine trying to use a credit card to give someone like 10 cents. The answer would be it would all go to the credit card company and the issuing bank and the guy would receive nothing or it would just be denied because I don't know if they allow transactions under a dollar if we're being honest. And so you get into these systems where like as they start to stack them, we could potentially have a really cool future where you know you're able to make decisions for yourself or rather you're able to get something that can make decisions for you in your interest.\n\nSo there's two parts of what you just said that are really interesting. One is the privacy aspect of it and the other is the sort of compensation or or monetary aspect of it. So like from a privacy perspective, you know, right now we live on a web where big corporations kind of suck up all of our data and they become these giant honeypots and like do they even want to deal with that data anyway? It's kind of a liability. So what if as a user you got to keep all that information to yourself and selectively prove that you are this kind of whatever person like on a need-to-know basis. You're sort of not giving up all of your information, but you can prove aspects about yourself that prove that you would be the right target for a certain ad.\n\nWell, and you can prove like you've never viewed the ad before and other like dumb things that advertisers are going to want to happen if they're going to like pay you as an individual to view an ad. They don't want to get scammed and so like this is triage against that as well. So, not only are you preserving your privacy on like your preferences and the fact that you want a new car and all these other things, you're also telling them, \"Hey, I'm not ripping you off.\" And so, like, it does two things at once. And these two things are very important for the advertisers trusting those systems and for the user being able to trust how those systems operate. Cuz like if I had to go on chain and like I have to state my name, my preferences, everything about me cuz it's possible you're going to need to state like income information like they may want to know like hey\n\nYeah I mean that's going to depend on what kind of car I buy. Am I buying a you know McLaren or am I buying a Toyota? Like\n\nRight Mercedes is going to want to know like does this guy make enough money for me to advertise to him? And so like you don't want to post all that information just in plain text on chain for everyone to see. You want to be able to like take some federated identity that assures them you're a person. Take some zero knowledge proofs that assure them, hey, I'm in an income bracket where you'd want to advertise to me. I'm likely to view or I'm likely to purchase it. There's a whole bunch of things that I can attest to that. You don't know exactly what it is. You've just written a set of rules that like these are the things in a person I want to advertise to. And I say I am that type of person and then they go okay cool here's the ad.\n\nThat's so interesting. Yeah. So there's the privacy aspect but it actually also works in the favor of the advertiser like you're saying where you want to make sure that somebody isn't just binging ads, you know, watching the same ad over and over and getting paid by the advertiser or company.\n\nYeah. You you don't want click farms like click farms are toxic. Like right now you have a bunch of people on phones viewing ads to like essentially steal money from platforms, right? You don't want that. How do you avoid it? Can you prove you're a person? Can you prove all these other things about you? Like, okay, can you prove you've never seen this ad before? All right, we're good. Here's the ad. Have fun. And here's 30 cents. Go view your article now. And then I think we we should also talk about the third component which is whether or not like web services start to embrace that you could charge small amounts for viewing content. So like instead of an ad service model on a thing like YouTube, the YouTube people could just be like, \"Hey, listen. Pay me 4 cents and I'll let you view the video.\" Or, \"Pay me 4 cents after the first 30 seconds.\" And they\n\n\nCould get points where, like, if they get a million views, that's 4 cents per view.\nLike, kind of fire.\nIt sounds like such a small shift, like, \"Oh, just a few cents, whatever, you know, to pay,\" but it is such a radical departure from the way things operate now.\nIt probably won't happen with black legacy platforms.\nIt'll probably be new platforms up and coming that realize we can use different forms of monetization to go forward.\nThey'll start to use them.\nIf they catch on, then other people will look at it and be like, \"Why aren't we using that?\nThat makes more sense,\" and then kind of like roll that forward.\nBut yeah, a lot of this is like, could it happen?\nMaybe.\nWill it happen?\nNo one knows.\nThis, while it sounds like it does sound like a radical kind of difference in the way these business models operate, there's actually also a lot of similarity because these ad networks are making small micro sort of transactions happen on the back end of a lot of websites and enabling this monetized open free web.\nAnd so it's not like something like that doesn't already exist.\nIt just sort of shifts around a little bit.\nWho is providing the money to who, right?\nAnd how much is being provided.\nIt's likely that any network that was able to get this going, it's probably paying a lot more to creators because creators can see, \"Hey, users are paying you 4 cents to view it.\nGive me three and a half.\"\nAnd like, instead of a 50-50 split like YouTube has or like a, you know, 60-40 or something weird, it just becomes a very transparent game they're playing.\nThey know exactly how much is there.\nThey know exactly how much is on the table, and they also don't have risk of getting demonetized by advertisers, 'cause like, I can't get demonetized if the users are paying me directly, and like, users will go seek out the ads or their AIs will seek out the ads so they're not next to my content.\nThey're just within the ad networks where the, you know, the ad page you get when you open your browser and it says, \"Hey, your funds are low.\nYou want to watch some ads?\"\nAnd you're like, \"Okay, fine.\"\nAnd then it shows you a bunch of cool ads.\nYou're you get hyped, and then you're like on the Internet having fun.\nMatt, would you willingly go out and watch ads for compensation?\nWell, I mean, I'm not going to go to an ad company and ask for the ad and go through all that process, but if there's a bespoke built-in process for the AI that is helping me manage my life and online identity to go and do that for me, yes.\nLike, if I open it up and I'm just like, \"Man, I haven't seen any ads in a while.\nLike, I know there's stuff I I'm probably just not aware of.\nTell me what what's out there that I should probably be buying,\" and then it brings up an ad.\nIt's like, \"Hey, did you see this cool new thing that was there?\"\nI was like, \"I didn't.\nThank you, AI.\"\nAnd that's, by the way, the utility of ads, right?\nLike, they're a good thing when served and managed well.\nThe first thing that comes to mind when I think of being paid to watch ads, I picture the guy from A Clockwork Orange, you know, undergoing the Levico technique with his like eyes being open.\nI mean, or mirror where he tries to close his eyes and his room beeps at him.\n\"Watch the ads.\nWatch the ads.\"\nBut that's the more dystopian point is like, we're going to get to the point where ads or ad companies or places that are trying to get you to watch ads so they can monetize the ad buys are just going to sit there and be like, \"We've found ways to detect how people and when people are watching ads, and we'll take over your 3D devices, and if you look away, we're just going to stop the ad and make you look at it.\"\nRight.\nVersus like, if it's something you want, if it's something you need, if it's a movie that you'll probably watch, if it's a if it's a game you want to play, if it's if it's things you'd want, but you're just generally not aware of it.\nThat's where like, you don't really have to coerce anyone to watch ads they want.\nIt's not a thing.\nLike, I I think we're too used to the caustic ads to realize that like, there are certain ads that hit and you're like, \"Man, awesome.\nLike, I just I was unaware this was there.\nI'm gonna go do this right now.\"\nYeah, it sounds like the ad economy can work for you, and it can do so through the unique combination of AI and Crypto.\nIt's a pretty nice vision of how these two technologies can coincide and provide some pretty interesting value.\nAbsolutely.\nYeah.\nLet's make the cipher funk future happen.\nExcellent.\nAll right, Matt.\nThanks for coming on.\nSee you.\nSo everybody listening out there, you can check out Matt's idea as well as all the other people you heard on this podcast.\nIf you go to a16zcrypto.com, you can see their special feature called AI and crypto crossovers.\nChalk full of good ideas in there.\nLet us know what you think when you read it.\nThanks for listening.\n",
