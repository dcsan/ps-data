this conversation, we explore how commodities differ fundamentally from other asset classes, the importance of cash-and-carry economics, the sparse information cadence that rewards technical models, and the physical realities that challenge purely quantitative approaches.\nWe also dive into Ben's more recent work on the geometry of the future surface, how convexity and skewness may be misunderstood, and why tools like LÃ©vy area may help uncover nonlinear structure in the data.\nWhether you're deep in the weeds of term structure trading or just curious about how to systematize chaos in barrels and bushels, this is a conversation you won't want to miss.\nPlease enjoy my conversation with Benjamin Hoff.\n[Music]\nBen, welcome to the show.\nVery excited to have you here and talk about all about commodities.\nI feel like it's pretty rare that I get a real commodity specialist on the show, much less a commodity strategy specialist.\nSo, thank you for joining me.\nReally looking forward to the conversation.\nSame here, Corey.\nThank you so much for having me on.\nSo, I know you didn't begin your career as a commodity strategist.\nFor the benefit of the listeners, can you start by walking us through your background and maybe take us through the accelerated story of how you got to where you are today?\nAbsolutely.\nIt better be accelerated, otherwise everyone will fall asleep.\nBut back in my more virtuous days, I actually started off as an academic.\nI have for all my sins a theoretical pure math PhD.\nAnd I kind of got into finance really through the flow of time.\nUm, I guess nothing really special or particularly designed by myself.\nI graduated in 2006, and at the time everyone and their dog who could basically solve a stochastic or differential equation was effectively sucked into the mstrom of Wall Street in the city, and one of those being sucked in was me, and I ended up on a rates exotics desk at the time as a desk plant and really cut my teeth on an asset class that's all about term structure.\nAnd at the time the bank I was with had a program that basically was designed to rotate people around different asset classes, and my second and as it turned out final rotation was in commodities and more specifically in commodity index.\nSo I ended up spending a bit of time on the trading side, trading the commodity index book for this bank and then quickly found out that my true calling or maybe more to the point the thing that I was least bad at was probably the sort of strategy slash math piece of things, and the rest is kind of history.\nSo, I've really spent the past 18 years at a variety of different banks and hedge funds, always involved with systematic commodity strategies from a variety of different angles and have now been back at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale for uh the past two years where I head the commodity strategy team.\nYou mentioned that you started your career on the rate side before moving to commodities.\nYou could draw a connection between those two asset classes because they both trade on a curve, but it feels like the similarities sort of end there.\nCan you talk a little bit about what were maybe sort of the lack of a better phrase curve culture shocks that you encountered as you switch desks from the rate side to the commodity side and maybe how you think about those differences and how those differences shape the way you think about looking at the commodity market and the pursuing of edge in commodities?\nYou bring up something quite important.\nI mean, I think they are both obviously curve asset classes where term structure and understanding the evolution of term structure is everything.\nThat is certainly something that both commodities and rates have in common.\nAnd I think it's something that a lot of folks who don't necessarily know the commodity asset class that well sometimes gets lost on them just because everyone thinks of a barrel of crude oil as having a particular price and that price going up and down.\nBut most commodity traders look at the world much more in terms of where a barrel of crude oil for delivery one month outprices relative to a barrel of crude oil for delivery in December.\nSo that's where you sort of see the similarity with rates that it is about term structure.\nWhere I would say the biggest difference really is, and I think this is interesting both from an economics perspective but also from a quant perspective, is the fact that the brittleness, if you like, of term structure in rates has very, very different drivers to what it has in commodities, and even when you look within commodities, it's really impossible to make generalized statements that apply to a WTI crude oil curve as much as they apply to a sugar curve.\nSo in rates, you know, you're typically looking at what is the Fed doing, why is it doing what it's doing, what are inflation expectations, what's going on in the FX world, employment numbers, all these kind of macro factors really feature in in terms of curve shape formation.\nWhen you look at commodities, you're basically living with an entirely different set of rules of gravity, if you like.\nThe crude oil term structure is of course driven by inventory, by supply, by demand, by geopolitics that affect the two.\nI mean, I think it's very obviously very timely that we're having this conversation on June 23rd against the backdrop of the destruction of the Iranian nuclear program and a potential closure of the Straits of Amuz, which seems to be affecting the market's thinking.\nIt's exactly that type of event that really affects how commodity term structures, specifically crude term structures, evolve and that determine the shape of those curves.\nSo things that have absolutely nothing to do with the typical drivers of what affect facts affects rate turn structure.\nIn our pre-call you mentioned this idea and sort of the play off your last answer there that a lot of the rates curve can be explained by expectations for central bank policies whereas in commodities the causal link is really this cash-and-carry economics, and so I was hoping maybe you could unpack that statement a little bit more, talk about inventory finance, storage capacity, and how credit conditions all sort of work together to tether spot and futures and sort of keep the dog on the leash, so to speak, and why that distinction is important for understanding why that tether can snap and when it can snap.\nYeah, exactly.\nI mean, I think that's actually a fantastic point you're reminding me of there.\nSo, absolutely.\nI mean, you know, I'm not going to waxical about an asset class like rates that I know significantly less about than I know about commodities.\nTruly when you look at what determines price formation along the crude oil term structure, just to use that as an example, it is really cash-and-carry dynamics that form to force first order at least the connection point between the deferred points on the term structure and the prompt points.\nAnd what I mean by that is when you think about it, well, why would a December contract include be tied to a July contract?\nWell, the reason is very much that you can buy, theoretically at least, a barrel of crude oil in July, put it in storage, finance the whole thing, and then sell it out again in December.\nAnd that basically ties in a very mechanical way the price of the contract in December to the price of a contract in July.\nAnd it's that arbitrage that ultimately to first order in a normally functioning world, and I will just emphasize normally functioning, really ties the two together.\nSo when it comes to understanding what can really snap that relationship, there's two very obvious things that go into it.\nIf I don't have access to credit at scale, then my ability to actually spot buy crude oil today and put it in storage is just non-existent.\nSo that's I think one really important thing and something that really does affect the way these markets and their terms structure price, particularly in times of financial distress.\nThe GFC is probably one really good example of this.\nThe other thing is, is there physical storage available?\nI mean, it's all great.\nYou can have all the credit in the world and at least hypothetically be able to buy as many barrels as you like on credit, but unless you can store those barrels and store them in the right location, I think that's the other important ingredient here.\nIt's just a pure theoretical exercise, and there is no real reason then if you can't find storage for that December barrel to in any way be tied to the July barrel, and so absent those two things you end up in a world where the curve structure, the term structure ultimately starts looking really quite brittle in commodity.\nThis is real, this isn't something that just happens once in a while when the world is falling apart, when some kind of arcane corner case, this is real, and you think about natural gas, you know, natural gas is the archetypal example of a highly seasonal commodity where basically the North American, the northern hemisphere winter ends typically in March, and it's basically a market where until March comes by, we keep on drawing from storage, and the fear that the market has is that we will end winter in a situation where there's not enough left in quote unquote the tank where we just run out, and that is what's reflected in the curve.\nSo what ends up happening is when you look at what that actually means, it means that there's a very natural dislocation that exists particularly at the beginning of winter between the March contract and subsequent experies just because it could very well be the case that at the end of winter there is nothing left to cash and carry over to the next season.\nSo these things are real, and it's not just natural gas, right?\nIt's corn, it's wheat, it's beans, it's anything that's on a seasonal production pattern with constant demand, which is basically the grains, the softs, gas.\nYou can start looking at seasonality obviously at a different time scale in electricity as well.\nBut these are phenomena that are deeply inherent to commodities and uniquely inherent to commodities.\nOne of the key differences you highlighted about the commodities market in our precall was this idea of basically a sparse information cadence that comes out for commodities, that there's very little fundamental news flow in commodities, and you were of the view that this made it a fertile ground for sort of more pure technical models, statistical models.\nI was hoping you could talk a little bit about this trade-off of the fundamental edges and the fundamental sources of news, whether it's actual reports or weather modeling or satellite crop imagery, for example, and how should systematic traders think about balancing some of these slower moving, more sparse fundamental signals versus the faster technical signals that left to run alone could just become sort of wild feedback loops in the market if they are untethered from the fundamentals.\nYeah, I mean, I think context here is everything, and I mean you bring up a really good point.\nIt's something that I think is really quite differentiating again for commodities versus other asset classes, in particular rates and FX, but also equities.\nI mean, just bear in mind, you know, when you look at the grains, you basically have a monthly was report, then depending on the season you might have a crop progress report that comes out weekly, and then you've got the big nothingness of winter where basically nothing is happening.\nSo that's very, very different to pretty much every other asset class under the sun.\nYou look at rates, I mean there's not a week that goes by where there isn't some not just one but multiple pieces of macro news flow which inherently have the ability to affect a fundamental repricing of the term structure.\nPretty much everything affects equities.\nNot just company specific news but all the macro news that you have in rates feeds into equities as well.\nThat is marketly different to commodities.\nSo then the question really becomes, well, what does a market like corn trade on when there's a sparseness of fundamental news flow?\nSo absent fundamental news flow, what are you going to trade on other than technical or at least apparently technical news flow?\nNow I say apparently because obviously the USDA is not the only propagator of fundamental information in grains markets, and this sort of ties back to your point, satellite imagery, real time weather data, these are all obviously things that are available, but the point that I think is really quite important to make here is that they're not necessarily cross-sectionally available by the same vendor using exactly the same data collection methods published at exactly the same time across 20 plus markets.\nSo what ends up happening is that price really ends up being the equilibrator there.\nRight?\nSo the way I look at the world is that a lot of this information ultimately gets factored into pricing and pricing ultimately ends up sort of providing this in a way where it's available cross-sectionally in some kind of transformed way.\nThis information cross-sectionally pretty much at the same time up to slight lags in closing time.\nAnd it's that perspective where you can kind of see that complete detethering and kind of closed circuit price formation just on technicals isn't exactly what we're dealing with.\nWhat I will say is not just sort of completely denigrate the role of fundamentals, but I look at fundamentals a little bit more as a way of categorizing market regimes in many ways.\nAnd you're really providing the backdrop for technical signals.\nAnd that is I think one really good way of using the slower moving and sometimes and often times actually market specific slower moving fundamental news flow.\nI want to talk about what happens when these markets become untethered because in the last 5 years we've lived through what we would probably consider to be two super contango episodes with WTI crude in April 2020.\nThen you had the nickel short squeeze in 2022.\nCan you talk a little bit about operationally what has to go wrong for the curve to really decouple and maybe use these as examples from spot and then how do you think about trading or even just surviving these moments as a commodity strategist?\nYeah, look, I mean, I think crude going negative to the tune of $37 and change in April 2020.\nCan't remember the exact date.\nI mean that is clearly not what was intended or what is typical in these markets.\nSo what went wrong?\nWell, 2020 I guess tested a lot of different financial markets to the limits.\nAnd I think one thing really worth bearing in mind when it comes to commodities is that commodities per se, commodity futures markets broadly and there are exceptions but broadly are not only financial markets, right?\nThey have a physical mechanism that basically allows the futures contract to\n\n\nexpire into\nsomething that requires the making or\ntaking of physical delivery of some\ncommodity.\nAnd so in that way, when I\nlook at commodity futures markets and I\ncontrast them with rates futures\nmarkets, bond futures markets, there's\nan added layer of complexity there and\nas a result, an added layer of\nvulnerability under market stress.\nSo\nwhen you're in this situation where\nbasically you've got a liquidity\nsqueeze, you have physical dislocations\nand the two happen at exactly the same\ntime.\nTo kind of bring up the example of\ncrude, then absolutely you can end up\nwith some fairly unexpected side effects\nsuch as negative pricing that should and\nis not the normal state of the world, but\nit is just something worth bearing in\nmind and it comes back to what I was\nsaying initially in a very easy, in a\nnormal world, to look at a barrel of\ncrude and the price of a barrel of crude\nthe same way as you look at a stock\nprice.\nThe truth of the matter is that\nthe underlying financial instrument\nreally is very, very different here and\nthat added layer of granularity of being\nable to make and take physical delivery\nis crucial to these markets, crucial to\ntheir survival.\nThat's why they exist.\nI\nmean, commodity futures markets do not\nexist for financial investors in the\nlast analysis.\nCommodity futures markets\nexist to facilitate risk transformation\nfor physical hedges.\nSo when you think\nof a barrel of crude oil, the thing has\non a good day an inherent volatility in\nthe spot market somewhere on the order\nof 30 to 40 vols.\nIf you're in the\nphysical market, you're either a\nconsumer or a producer.\nThat's a pretty\nsignificant value at risk to be carrying\non your balance sheet.\nThe role that commodity futures markets\nhave is to allow the transformation of\nthat directional risk into a time spread\nrisk by allowing a producer to short\nfutures against the physical barrel.\nAnd\nin doing so, you end up dropping the\nnative volatility of the combination of\nthe spot instrument and the futures\ninstrument by an order of magnitude\npretty much.\nSo that is why these\nmarkets exist.\nFinancial investors.\nThey're great to have.\nWe love them in\nthe marketplace, but they are not the\nprimary economic reason why these\nmarkets are around.\nThat's one crucial\ndifference with financial markets.\nSo\nbefore we start talking about different\ncommodity strategies, which is where\nwe're going to spend the majority of the\ntime of this episode, I want to pose to\nyou maybe what is a little bit of an\nunfair question, but it's one that comes\nup a lot for long only investors and it\ncomes up a lot in academic papers, which\nis the question of is there a true\ncommodity risk premium for long only\nexposure?\nOften long only commodity\nexposure is marketed as having this idea\nof an inflation beta.\nAnd the question\nis, is there an X anti-risk premium in\neither the spot markets or the futures\nof markets that investors can actually\nharvest by simply being long\ncommodities?\nAnd I know it's probably a\nvery nuanced answer because every\ncommodity market is so different, but\nI'm curious as someone who has studied\nthese markets for as long as you have,\nwhere do you come down?\nIs there a\npositive expected risk premium that can\nbe harvested just by being netlong\ncommodities?\nYeah, I mean I think that's\na really good question, Corey, and I'd\nprobably need to sit here and scratch my\nhead a little bit about exactly the\nright way to answer, but my sense is\nthat there's a little bit of a nuance or\ndifference between the academic and the\npractical.\nSo when people look at long\nonly commodity exposure, typically who\nyou're looking at are financial players\nwho are looking to hedge something,\nright?\nWhat they're looking to hedge is\nunexpected inflation.\nAnd so in the\ncontext of your optimization function\nbeing to hedge unexpected inflation, it\ndefinitely seems the case that\ncommodities have sort of lived up to\nexpectation and at least for the past\ncouple of decades and provided that\nunexpected inflation hedge in the\ncontext of a long only commodity\nallocation.\nNow drilling down a little\nbit more, I would be very much picking\nup on your point that it really depends\non the commodity market in question\nbeing monolithically long at all times\nacross all 25 liquid BCOM or GSCI\nmarkets for the purpose of pure alpha\ngeneration.\nI mean the back test\nbasically tells the story.\nThere is no\nalpha there.\nIn fact, there's probably\nnegative alpha there.\nSo you would\nprobably need to be a little bit more\nnuanced if you were looking at the world\nin terms of alpha generation.\nAnd indeed\nthere's an entire industry around this\nwhich I'm sure we'll come to talk about\nshortly.\nIn your article commodity\nfactor investing, you propose a really\nnovel concept where you map the entire\ncommodity term structure into this 2D\nsurface where you have calendar time on\none axis and and time to expiry on the\nother.\nAnd using this surface, you\nactually recover familiar investment\nstyles like momentum and carry as\npartial derivatives of this surface.\nAnd\nthis is the first time I'd ever read\nsomething like this.\nI thought it was\nreally unique.\nWhat do you think that\nthis lens, this approach of thinking of\ndifferent investment styles via\nderivatives of this surface?\nWhat does\nthat reveal that maybe some single\nfactor studies where you're looking at\nthese things truly as isolation and not\nsimply as derivatives of a common\nobject?\nWhat are those single factor\nstudies miss that this surface view\nprovides you?\nWell, probably the most\nimportant aspect for me when I look at\nwhat generates commodity alpha in\ngeneral is what is the economic\nprinciple behind what we're trying to do\nhere.\nAnd you know that was very much\nthe inspiration of this paper as well.\nSo when I look at what is likely to\npersist when you've got a any alter\nsignal commodities or elsewhere doesn't\nreally matter.\nYou really care about two\nthings.\nOne is the strength of your\nsignal and the other is how long is the\nsignal likely to persist for.\nAnd you\nreally want to have a combination of\nboth because a strong signal basically\nkind of means that you're more likely to\nhit your target.\nPersistence ultimately\nmeans that you're in a world where\nyou're not just flipping around\nperpetually.\nAnd so when you think about\nthis whole idea of effectively fitting\nif you like a tangent space to the\nsurface that's made up out of one\ndimension being time to expert in the\nother dimension being time.\nYou can kind\nof see that what we're trying to do here\nis really just capture the fact that\nhopefully that tangent space is going to\nbe slower moving than the thing we're\neffectively approximating.\nAnd that's\nsomething that's quite common in\nmathematics.\nI mean, you know, that's\nwhy people look at derivatives of curves\nthat's up to some order because they\ndon't necessarily care about the super\nfine structure that's captured, you\nknow, five orders down the tailor\nexpansion.\nThey're good enough just\nknowing, you know, what is the first\norder and maybe the second order\nderivative.\nAnd so the approach here is\neffectively to say, look, it's the first\nand second order derivative that\nactually have meaningful economics\nassociated to them and they're cross\nderivatives.\nSo the derivative with\nrespect to time, the second derivative\nwith respect to time, the derivative\nwith respect to time to expiry, the\nsecond derivative with respect to time\nto expiry, which is effectively the\nconvexity with crucial for carry\nstrategies, and then the cross\nderivatives and so that's really where\nwe were coming from there is to\nbasically say look where is the\npersistency likely to be.\nTruth be told,\nthis comes back to where we were a\ncouple of minutes ago.\nCommodity markets\nultimately are designed for physical\nhedges.\nAnd physical hedges, they can't\nafford to operate in a world where the\ncurved surface is effectively snapping\naround in a completely random way every\nday, right?\nThat just does not allow for\nrationally based hedging decisions that\ncan persist through time.\nAnd that's\nultimately what they're after.\nSo you\ncan kind of sort of see which came\nfirst, which came second.\nProbably a\nlittle bit like chicken and egg.\nBut the\ntruth is you cannot have dynamics which\nare completely random when it comes to\nthe actual curve dynamics that are\ncaptured by these derivatives.\nAnd just\nfor sort of completeness to make sure\neveryone's on the same page as we're\ntalking about this, can you walk through\neach of the derivatives and how it links\nto maybe what already exists in the\nliterature as one of the style premium\nor whether it represents maybe a unique\nfactor?\nYeah.\nAnd absolutely.\nSo look,\nyou know, first of all, I'll just\npreface it with the fact that it's not a\npanacea.\nYou cannot recover every single\ncommodity QIS style with this approach.\nBut the styles that you can recover, the\nfirst derivative with respect to time, I\nmean, is basically uh trend.\nThe second\nderivative with respect to time still\nkind of some version of trend.\nYou can\nmaybe call it trend of trend.\nThen you\nstart moving on to derivatives with\nrespect to time to exper.\nI mean a\nstrategy that's been out there for a\nlong time now is something that's often\nlabeled as backquidation momentum which\nis effectively ranking of a portfolio of\ncommodities according to the slope of\ntheir term structure where the idea is\nto go long the markets that are most\nbackquidated.\nSo where the front of the\ncurve is pricing at the strongest\npremium relative to the back of the\ncurve and short the markets where you've\ngot the exact opposite where the front\nof the curve is pricing at a discount to\nthe back of the curve.\nSo that's\nsomething that pretty much linearly maps\nto the turf first derivative of the\nsurface with respect to time to x3.\nThe\nsecond derivative with respect to time\nto x3 is really convexity.\nConvexity is\na crucial driver in carry strategies.\nYou know, when you think about commodity\ncarry, what's the idea?\nWell, the idea\nis to be short the front of the term\nstructure and long the back of the term\nstructure.\nNow, if you've got a\nperfectly linear curve, and I would say\ngold is a good example of this most of\nthe time where effectively gold\nbasically just prices on a carry basis\nthat's relative comparative to the value\nof an ounce of gold.\nThe storage of gold\nis dimminimous.\nThe insurance costs are\nrelatively small.\nSo what you end up\nwith is effectively this financing cost\nwhich is just linear in the cost of\ngold.\nSo gold effectively is an example\nof a market where being short the front\nof the curve and long the back of the\ncurve could theoretically generate you\nreally nice sharp ratios but almost no\nreturns because rolling down the front\nof the curve at exactly the same rate\nand making money because you're short as\nyou're losing money on the back of the\ncurve where you're rolling down as well\nat exactly the same rate but in that\ninstance you're long.\nSo that's not a\ngood example.\nBut other markets like\ncrude, like natural gas, you've got this\nsituation where there's negative\nconvexity in your term structure where\nbasically if the curve shape doesn't\nchange and it stays exactly like it is\ntoday and the only change is really the\nfact that time keeps marching forward,\nthen what happens is that due to the\nnegative convexity, you're rolling down\nat a slower rate in the back where you\nlong than you're rolling down in the\nfront where you short.\nAnd because\nyou're rolling down at a higher quote\nunquote speed in the front, you end up\nmaking more money on the short side than\nyou're losing on the long side.\nSo this\nnotion of convexity absolutely crucial\nin carry also because it's relatively\nslower moving.\nNow it's obviously not\nthe say only driver of a carry strategy\nbecause carry strategies obviously have\nsensitivity to changes in slope.\nBut\nchanges in slope.\nThis basically comes\nto the next value style that's\nincorporated in this curved derivative\nframework which is basis momentum.\nRight?\nSo basis momentum the idea\nbroadly behind basis momentum is to ask\nhow is the slope of the curve changing\nthrough time.\nIf I've got a positive\nchange of slope through time, I probably\nwant to be going long because the curve\nis steepening.\nAnd I've got a negative\nchange in slope through time.\nI want to\nprobably be going short because the\ncurve shape is weakening.\nSo again,\nyou've got sort of the final version\nthere of QIS strategies that are\nencapsulated.\nNow what's interesting,\nCory, is that there's clearly a limit to\nthis, right?\nYou could keep on playing\nthis game of effectively having higher\nand higher tailor order expansions, but\nI touched on this briefly in one of the\nprevious questions where we talked about\nhow producers and consumers can\ntransform their flat price risk into\nspread risk by trading futures against\ntheir physical position.\nAnd in so\ndoing, their advantage to them is that\nthey end up reducing the volatility by\nan order of magnitude.\nNow, what we've\njust been talking about is kind of\nsimilar, right?\nIf you wanted to, you\ncould probably play this game of\nexpanding your curve approximation to\nhigher order derivatives.\nBut the\nproblem is if you really want to capture\nthe third order derivative, you need to\nbe trading spreads of spreads.\nSo, two\nspreads on the same curve.\nAnd in so\ndoing, you've effectively just dropped\nyour volatility by another order of\nmagnitude.\nAnd so you get to this point\nwhere it just basically ends up being a\nnegative tradeoff between the alpha you\ncould theoretically harvest and the\ntransaction costs that you're incurring\nto do so where basically the alpha that\nyou're trying to capture just does not\nhave inherently enough volatility to\njustify that.\nSo that's why most people\nus included would typically say second\norder is as far as any reasonable person\ncan possibly go.\nI want to go back to\nthe point you were making about carry\nstrategies because carry strategies are\na very common place in commodities\nespecially commodity QIS and you wrote a\npaper in 2024 titled all you ever wanted\nto know about commodity carry and you\nhighlighted in that paper this idea that\ntraditional carry includes significant\nexposure to this second order term\nstructure convexity and it's not just\nsort of this linear ro yield concept.\nAnd so for people who are hearing this\nfor the first time, right, who maybe\nhaven't thought through the world via\nthis surface idea, this sort of second\norder derivative and what that convexity\nmeans.\nHow should allocators to\ncommodity carry or people who are\ndesigning commodity carry strategies\nreinterpret classic carry metrics in\nlight of this convexity?\nHow should they\nbe rethinking about what this convexity\ncomponent of returns implies for what\ncarry is ultimately pricing and the\nrisks embedded in carry styles.\nIt's a\nreally interesting one because I find\nthe whole convexity notion actually\nallows you to articulate in very clear\nintuitive economic words what\nspecifically the risk premium is that\nyou're trying to capture.\nWhen you think\nabout commodity carry strategies, I mean\nyou can do a PCA of any principal\ncomponent analysis of any commodity term\nstructure and you'll find that well the\nfirst three principal components are\nreally dominant.\nThe first one is\nbasically just the level price\nmovements.\nThe second one is changes in\nslope and the third one is basically the\nconvexity piece.\nAnd when you look at\nthe first two, they basically are highly\nsubject to exogenous shocks.\nThe third\none, the convexity piece is actually\nmuch more about the micro supply chain\nof an individual market.\nAnd so just\ntake crude oil as an example, just\nbecause it's June 23rd, it's topical.\nWe\nactually have Iran potentially\nthreatening to do something that would\naffect the flow of crude, at least a\npretty significant chunk of it.\nAnd we\n\n\nI can see this effect at play. So when you think about crude oil, if you're an independent refiner, you can't put a barrel, a futures contract into your refinery. What you need is a physical barrel of crude oil. And we talked about this earlier is this whole idea of risk premium that gets reflected through the convexity, right? The fact that the front rolls down a little bit faster than the back. What you're saying in different words is that the front is pricing a little bit richer than it actually should compared to the back. And the way that quote unquote pricing, it's not a mispricing, it's a risk premium. The way that evaporates away in a world where there's no materialization of stockout risk is that the front rolls down just a touch faster than the back and you end up monetizing that. That is effectively how that convexity plays out. And that is something that's actually very easy to put in words, very intuitive. And when you look at it from a portfolio perspective, one of the beauties of commodity carry, and you can really see this play out over the past couple of decades really is how robust that strategy is. And the reason it's robust is because you've really got causal decorrelation at play there. What constitutes a stockout risk in crude oil is some geopolitical event, which we may or may not be experiencing right now with Iran threatening to close the straits of Amuz. What affects the realization of a stockout risk in natural gas is really an unseasonally cold winter. And so it goes, you know, the same basically holds true for grains, for softs, anything that has a harvest ultimately is subject to weather risk. And the fact that these weather risks happen in different geographies makes them decorrelated. Moreover, they all combined, all of them combined, they all are ultimately very decorrelated to what would constitute the equivalent of stockout risk in other markets such as rates and FX. So that's why commodity carry is in many ways so robust and applicable in a broader portfolio context.\n\nWhen you talked about the surface, you mentioned that not every commodity strategy necessarily fits neatly into this surface model. And two that come to mind that are popular are value and skewness. And so my first question would be my presumption is that those don't fit nicely onto the surface. So maybe if they do, how do they map? And if not, how do you think about these exceptions in this sort of surface modeling world you've created?\n\nYou're exactly right. I mean, I think skewness and value are two popular strategies which just don't fit. Skewness is obviously predicated on capturing tails or historic tails in the return distribution of individual markets. So that's a notion that has nothing to do with a surface. So hence it doesn't fit. So in short the answer is I don't think about them in the same way. I think about them as really something that is completely orthogonal. Certainly for skewness value in many ways is an interesting beast because it seems to me like there's quite a proliferation in terms of what different banks call value. There's a lot of different implementations. None of them have anything really to do with the surface model. Although I would like to say one thing here Corey, probably one unifying concept for value is that each of these curve factors can be traded on a value basis if you just view value as mean reversion to some extent. Now the question is what is likely to mean revert and that I think is really where the complexity comes in. Value in commodities is a difficult thing to really get right because as opposed to what one might think when one first hears value in commodity space the way value is usually implemented in some QIS strategies is that it's implemented on more of a cross-sectional basis right and when you think about what you need to implement anything on a cross-sectional basis you need a unified methodology then you sort of turn back to the commodity asset class and you know there you are looking at we were talking about this initially crude which depending on the specific grade you're looking at if you're looking at WTI you've got weekly department of energy stats if you're looking at corn you've got monthly was reports and possibly depending on the time of something that's crop progress reports at a weekly frequency but what's lacking is some form of unifying framework for the signal. So what a lot of people revert to is just kind of using price as a proxy for value and then end up sort of basically saying well how deviant am I today for a given market from what the 5-year average price is and that's effectively going to determine my mean reversion level. So there's obviously a million things that are not 100% correct with that particular model view of the world. One of them is the fact that five years is a long time in commodity markets and you're not necessarily capturing a stationary phenomenon if your look back period is five years. The question is do you have enough data if you start shortening your look back window to something shorter. So there are a lot of potential issues with that. But the overall point here is really what do you define as value? What's going to mean revert? And that is really the only connection that I can potentially see with these types of curved surfaces. For the mathematically inclined, your curved surface model has a lot of appealing features, but I can imagine that if you're not incredibly thoughtful in your translation from a curved surface model to some sort of strategy implementation, you might actually miss the fact that you could end up connecting contracts that in the physical world can't actually be transformed into one another because they're truly physically different products, right? a different harvest, whatever it is, they're not truly the same thing being sold despite the fact that those contracts arguably exist on the same futures curve. Curious how you think about guarding around that in developing strategies using this surface model concept. I really appreciate the question because to some extent it really highlights the specificity of the commodity asset class and the fact that when you've got a hammer then not everything is a nail or at least not everything is the same nail. A good example I think to maybe illustrate this a little bit for listeners is when you think of something as mundane as gasoline. Gasoline futures relatively liquid. But the truth is summer gasoline is chemically not the same thing as winter gasoline. They have different read vapor requirements which basically mean that summer gasoline chemically has a different constituency to winter gasoline. what you can deliver into the contract is chemically different and priced differently. So there's no reason ever under any circumstances to believe that winter gasoline, call it a January contract, should roll up to the same price as a July contract. They're just chemically different things. The same obviously holds true when you start looking at seasonal commodities, right? It holds a little bit less true because it really depends on the year. If you end up in a year where the winter is relatively mild, then yeah, absolutely the March and April contract should become potentially fungible in physical space if the stock risk premium really just drops to zero. But absent that, there's no reason that you should have roll up. And that's something where basically part of it is just calling a spade a spade and being able to really just recognize that you can have markets which might arrange chemically different things on the same term structure and you can have other markets that are highly seasonal in nature where that seasonality can perturb the arrangement of contracts that look like they smoothly connected on the Bloomberg terminal. Call a spade a spade and you're fine to go kind of thing. I want to jump into a specific strategy implementation. In a recent paper you wrote where you talk about lead lag effects both cross-sectionally and along a single curve and you introduce this idea of a what's called a LÃ©vy area metric. And so I thought this would be a fun example to dive deep on a recent strategy concept you proposed. First, can you provide some background as to why you believe lead lag is a fertile signal to be harvested in the commodity space and then draw this connection to what is the LÃ©vy area signal and why do you think it is the appropriate signal for harvesting this lead lag effect.\n\nSo look, I mean, you know, when you look at commodities as an asset class, just from an intuitive, from a fundamental perspective, it seems relatively apparent that there should be lead lag effects, right? When you think about take any market that's about feed stock and refined product. I mean, you can look at energy liquids, but the others as well. Bean oil, the beans complex is another one. Bean oil, bean meal versus beans, the crush spread. But if we just focus on energy liquids, the truth is that if you're an independent refiner, you're going to have price sensitivity to your feed stock, but it's not the feed stock that you're selling. You're selling refined product. And it's not crude oil that consumers consume. It's refined product. So the business model is basically the margin between the two for an independent refiner. the margin is effectively directly proportional to what you can sell your refined products for versus what your feed stock costs are. And so when your business is to optimize that spread, then you are going to be keenly focused on effectively passing on and adjusting the pass on of feed stock changes to your end users. And also the flip side obviously holds as well. when demand starts eroding, how long does that take before it shows up in terms of demand for crude oil? Typically, most refiners will have feed stock in storage, which they may choose to run down prior to bidding for new crude. So, it's those types of effects which one would expect to show up in pricing in commodity markets as a whole. So this is sort of where this paper really came from is sort of asking the question well over what time frames and under what circumstances does it make sense to try to exploit these types of lead lag relationships. Now there's obviously a whole academic body around measuring and isolating lead lag relationships. Probably the most trivial way to do this is by just looking at the autocorrelation of two return streams and effectively the lagged autocorrelation should effectively tell you whether there's a lead lag relationship there. The problem is one would expect that if you reverse time any such methodology should then also reverse who it identifies as the leader and who it identifies as a lagard. And the problem with autocorrelation is it really completely fails that you know it's completely agnostic to meeting a calendar time. So in that sense the risk with these types of measures that are autocorrelationbased is that you end up picking up things where there isn't really a lead lag relationship and missing out on other things where there is a lead lag relationship just because the methodology isn't clever enough to see that. That's sort of one issue. The other issue I mean is another popular choice to measure lead lag relationships is Granger causality. But Granger causality makes an implicit model relationship. And the model relationship is the thing that's leading and the thing that's lagging are somehow linearly related. So when they're not linearly related then again you run the risk of kind of missing out on part of the information set. And this is really where LÃ©vy area comes in. So LÃ©vy area is basically something that's pretty deep from a mathematical perspective and I want to sort of wax lyrical on things that are quite frankly above my academic pay grade but LÃ©vy area is a derivative of or part of a broader mathematical theory called the theory of rough paths which allows you to basically solve stochastic differential equations path by path. So as opposed to getting an answer or solution that's a stochcastic process or a random variable, what you can do is you can solve along something that's as rough as Brownian motion and effectively say here's the deterministic answer that you get if you solve a system along the specific Brownian path. So it's pretty deep. It's got a lot of potentially interesting applications in machine learning. But the way we've used it here is that LÃ©vy area is effectively the anti-symmetric part of the second order iterated integral of a multi-dimensional path. Now I probably lost everyone including myself in saying this but what it means intuitively is if that if you have two asset prices and you're calculating the LÃ©vy area what you're doing is you're letting those asset prices run through time stopping the clock connecting the end point of that two-dimensional path that you've just run in the plane with the origin and asking what is the oriented area that I've traced out between this path and the chord of the path with the origin.\n\nAnd when the path has a propensity to orient against counterclockwise, you get a positive LÃ©vy area. When the path has a propensity to orient clockwise, you get a negative LÃ©vy area. And so one way to get a positive LÃ©vy area is if the first constituent of this two-dimensional path, so the first asset leads or anticipates largely anticipates the second asset. In that case, you get a positive LÃ©vy area. Why? Well, I kind of go through the gory details of the math behind this in my paper, but it's not actually that complicated if you just take a simple little model path and go through the math. And the same holds the other way around. Now, the beauty of this is that it's effectively model free. I'm not making any assumptions between asset A, the relationship between asset A and asset B. They can be linear, it could be nonlinear, could be a polomial, it could be a sinosoidal curve. I don't really particularly care. I'm just measuring particular path statistic here. So the other thing that's really nice about it is that it addresses one of the deficiencies of autocorrelation, which is that if you permute asset one and acid 2, or put differently, if you reverse time, you flip the sign of the LÃ©vy area. So you've got these two properties which make the LÃ©vy area quite an attractive way of measuring lead lag relationships. Moreover, and this is something that kind of goes a little bit deeper here, you managed to pick up lead lag relationships at different time scales simultaneously. That's also pretty powerful. So that was something that we kind of deployed in two frameworks. One was just cross-sectionally identifying across a portfolio of commodities which one is the set of leaders which one belongs to the set of lagards and then positioning the lagards in the direction of the leaders tomorrow hedging them with the leaders of today. That's one system seems to work relatively well robustly particularly in energy liquids. The other system is looking at term structure, right? Where you can basically play exactly the same game but this time using different points of the term structure for the same commodity. So there too you end up with lead lag relationship. And what's interesting is that the lead lag relationships that you identify in the second term structure-based approach allow you to really quantitatively make statements about how is a curve steepening, how is it weakening? Is the steepening of the term structure driven by the front of the curve or is it driven by weakening of the back of the curve? The two mean very different things and they're not necessarily visible to the raw eye and certainly not visible on a statistical basis where you can\n\n\nRun this all through some kind of clever Python script, which basically tells you statistically the copper curve is more likely to steepen, led by the front than the back.\nSo those are the sort of two major applications, really, Corey, that we came up with.\nThe paper shows really impressive sharp ratios, quote-unquote, in the theoretical limit before we start to apply transaction costs.\nHow close can real money traders get to the performance quoted in the paper once we start to layer in liquidity constraints, once we start to talk about trading the markets outside of the major liquid energy contracts?\nIs this the type of strategy that truly can be traded in isolation, or is this the type of strategy that should be used as a conditional trading signal when executing other strategies?\nYou know, more of as an input to a larger portfolio optimization.\nA good reason why we put this paper out as the theoretical limit is because this is research and not structuring.\nSo there's a little bit of a line between the two.\nBut to answer your question specifically, the directional systems that we have, particularly those in energy liquids, are close to what is reasonably implementable, factoring in transaction costs.\nThe transaction costs will impact performance, but to the point where you're probably going to pay away on a strategy that has like a 1.5 sharp, maybe half a sharp, probably a little bit more, and still end up with something, provided you've got the technical setup in place that is actionable.\nNow, the curve strategies, the way I would look at those is there's always a trade-off here, right?\nYou can find all kinds of alpha when you're not correcting for transaction costs.\nBut the transaction costs again, they are kind of very much specific to individual clients, and it's difficult to really use generalized rules as to how much someone's going to pay to trade a particular spread full circle.\nBut the way I would probably think about building a system out of this is that I would ignore the signal if it were choosing me a spread that just has a volatility that at least statistically has been too low to justify the transaction costs associated with trading it.\nThere are all kinds of ways then, obviously, on top of that, that you can use to slow this type of system down.\nDo you want to be looking at a look-back period for your lead-lag formation that's 20 days, or do you want to be looking at 30 days or 40 days?\nDo you want to be looking at a directional position formation that looks at two-day returns, three-day returns, five-day returns?\nYou're going to get very different results, results that are going to atrophy some of the performance away, but simultaneously are going to have a positive effect in terms of reducing transaction costs, and that ultimately is really something that depends on where the individual trader is set up commercially.\nAnother paper you wrote called \"Seasonalities Greetings.\"\nGreat title.\nIn that paper, your work suggested that static monthly seasonality premia are elusive, but weekly patterns, especially in highly liquid energy markets, actually persist.\nI'm curious how you reconcile those findings with sort of the very intuitive, very real seasonality fundamentals that exist in commodity markets like the AS.\nYeah.\nSo I mean, I think that's a really good question as well, Corey.\nSo what's interesting about commodities is that there's a little bit of a mismatch between fundamentals and what markets are pricing.\nSo just because you have a clearly seasonal term structure forward curve does not mean that there's actually money to be made of that seasonality.\nThe market could be exactly right in the way it's pricing today its expectation of a seasonal phenomena that's repetitive three, four months out.\nAnd when that's the case, that's exactly the situation where you end up effectively putting on a trade on the basis of some seasonal phenomenon, but effectively seeing no return.\nAnd to me, that's in many ways, from an economic perspective, actually quite encouraging when we see that, because what it's telling you is that the market is actually typically quite effective at pricing seasonal weather effects correctly.\nNot every year, but through time, that certainly seems to be the case.\nAnd that's ultimately a good thing, not a bad thing.\nBecause when it comes to what these markets are designed for, in the last analysis, I keep coming back to this, producers and consumers and facilitating their business, ultimately what you want is kind of micro insurance that's fairly priced.\nAnd when that seasonal risk premium is compressed, then that's exactly the situation you're in, that that micro insurance has been fairly priced.\nSo, that's encouraging.\nNow, you also mentioned the fact that seasonality can obviously occur at different time scales, right?\nThere's obviously our shading as human beings is that we think of seasonality in terms of summer, winter, fall, and spring, but effectively, from a mathematical slash-trading perspective, seasonality could exist intraday, it could exist on a weekday basis, and so we kind of took a look at the weekday pieces as well.\nAnd you know, it's interesting what ended up transpiring is that the group of commodities that really stuck out, and you know, we've got a little chart of this in our paper where you can really see, uh, TI, Brent, heating oil, gas oil all globbing together, and from a sharp perspective as a weekly seasonality trade.\nAnd what's interesting as well, and this is kind of where I would sort of see in many ways the limits of my own knowledge, you can look at the results and then you can find the story afterwards, or you can come up with the story and effectively find the numbers afterwards.\nBut the truth of the matter is, it's unclear that there's necessarily a causal connection between the two.\nBut there's a case to be made where when you look at independent refiners, again, this seems to be my go-to example.\nFrom their perspective, one of the largest business risks that they have is weather.\nAnd it's also one of the largest business risks that I have on an intake basis.\nWhy?\nWell, because effectively they run their operations seven days a week, but they can only really hedge five days a week, and demand for products ends up being largely weather-determined.\nThat's true both for driving and it's true for heating demand as well.\nAnd so you end up in this situation where, and this is the economic argument, I'm not saying it's necessarily the cause, but it's the economic argument for these backtest results, you end up in this situation where refiners are arguably incentivized to hedge as close as possible to the weekend when they know or have a better idea of what the weather for the weekend is going to be rather than three or four days before the weekend.\nSo typically a refiner is, per se, long what we call cracks.\nSo product cracks.\nSo product tracks are long products, oil, jet fuel, gas oil, and they short feedstock, feedstock being crude oil.\nSo what they're going to do is they're going to bas the hedge is going to be the other way around.\nThe hedge is basically going to sell product cracks.\nSo effectively, by um, selling one unit of product cracks on a Thursday, buying a couple of units, two units on a Friday, and then selling the remaining unit on a Monday, you can kind of create this trade which provides liquidity to refiners, to independent refiners, and that is at the core what we think we're picking up here in terms of this weekly seasonality that isolates the energy liquids.\nI want to take a huge step back here.\nWe've been diving in the weeds of all these different strategy ideas, and I want to talk about commodities as a complex and commodities as a complex over time, because there's been a dramatic financialization of commodities over the last 30 years, arguably since the GSCI index became investable, and as I'll call it, passive AUM poured into the market, certain strategies worked, like congestion strategies, and then they didn't.\nI'm curious, through your lens, as someone who's operated as a commodity strategist for almost two decades now, what's changed in market structure, what has become a structural change, and what are sort of cyclical changes that you see evolving through the market that maybe make some strategies more appealing at certain times than others as financialized interest in the commodity space sort of waxes and wanes?\nYeah.\nYeah, I mean, I think you bring up congestion.\nI mean, congestion strategies, pre-roll strategies are basically premised on providing liquidity to long-only commodity index investors.\nAnd so you kind of end up in this situation where the issue really becomes what happens once the index has been provided all the liquidity it could possibly need.\nDoes the role signature of the index start depreciating?\nAnd I think that's probably part of what we've seen over the past couple of years.\nSimultaneously, you're absolutely right in pointing out that if the core driver of these types of strategies is ultimately the existence of sufficient index AUM in commodity markets, then it's probably worth paying attention to the cyclicality of that index AUM.\nAnd that's undeniable.\nI mean, there's a bunch of folks out there, as we discussed initially, who are basically looking to hedge their unexpected inflation risk through commodity index, and as inflation fears wax and wane, so does commodity index AUM, so that should have a trickle-down effect, your pre-roll strategies.\nNow, that's kind of one side of the ledger.\nThe other side of it is the fact you have a variety of market micro structure changes that have been, in many ways, the result of an increased financialization of commodities.\nSo specifically, when you look at how people estimate commodity index AUM, it's usually premised on a relatively simple model which assumes that the world basically consists only of two commodity indices, which is the BCOM and the GSCI, and then furthermore assumes that all the AUM is held in the very front of the curve, and basically by isolating the two markets that are unique to the GSCI and the two markets that are unique to the BCOM and overlaying that with the AUM estim, well, the AUM that's reported in the supplemental commodity index trader report that the CFTC publishes every Friday, you can kind of extrapolate out what is the BCOM AUM and what is the GSCI AU.\nNow, it turns out that it's probably been a couple of months since I last looked at this, but in late 2024, in fact, GSCI AUM ended up apparently going negative on the basis of this model.\nAnd that was largely driven by cocoa, right?\nSo the issue really becomes what happens when you've got these smaller markets where people might be using the index and get reported as using the index for taking positions that have nothing to do with the broader index.\nThen you can kind of have these perturbative effects.\nAnd I use this as an example, not so much to go into the depths of how index AUM is estimated, but more just to show that the financialization of commodities has meant that you've got a whole swath of investors in these markets now that may not be solely commodity index long guys.\nAnd that's changed the market structure.\nAnd this is one very specific example of how it's impacted the index world and AUM estimation.\nWell, your cocoa example leads me right into my next question.\nYou made a brief comment at the end of our pre-call about thinking about the ties between commodities and systematic macro and how systematic macro traders incorporate commodities, right?\nAnd cocoa, the trade you're talking about, I think was a trade that got heavily influenced by CTAs, right?\nIn many cases, CTAs, trend followers in particular, think of commodities just as another, I think this is your quote actually, just another return stream to risk balance at the end of the day.\nI'm curious as your thoughts as commodities are an active component of a lot of macro and systematic macro strategies.\nHow do you see the macro linkages to rates and FX and equities?\nAnd how should a systematic macro trader decide when a commodity signal is really idiosyncratic to commodities versus something that's more globally allocable?\nYeah, I mean, I think that's again a fantastic question, Corey.\nThe way I'd probably answer that as a first stab is it depends really on the design of the underlier that the signal is being applied to, right?\nI mean, you can have any number of pure macro signals that ultimately will trickle through to how a particular curve shape evolves.\nAnd if your implementation is curve shape, then really what you've got is an interpretation of a particular macro signal on the microeconomics of a particular commodity rather than an expression of a macro view.\nIt's a micro expression of a macro view.\nSo to me, the investable and the investable design is quite a crucial point.\nThe other thing is, look, I mean, truth be told, you can't really be a systematic macro trader without understanding commodity micro relatively well.\nAnd I think gold is a fantastic example of this, right?\nSo truth be told, there's a million different ways that you can trade half of the things or three-quarters of the things that gold is sensitive to.\nYou know, you can certainly trade dollarization or debasement of dollars that deemed in FX markets way more liquidly actually than you could trade it in gold, way more specifically, arguably than you could trade it in gold.\nYou could do the same with inflation, right?\nJust so happens that gold is basically a catch-all for all things macro.\nSo, it ends up having sensitivity to inflation.\nBut the truth is, if you really wanted to put on an inflation trade, you would probably not choose gold to do it, because the more specific your macro trade is, the worse an alternative gold ultimately ends up being, because you'd probably want to trade inflation in a particular currency that you have a particularly strong view on, not on something as catch-all as gold.\nSo gold has all these things, but then it has additional sensitivities that are not really captured by most other ways of expressing better known macro risks.\nAnd I think a lot of that is sort of what's really come to the fore over the past six months, notably even over this weekend.\nYou know, what other commodity, what other market really gives you sensitivity to policy uncertainty, to weaponization of financial systems, to systemic counterparty risk, to geopolitical instability?\nThat is what's unique to gold.\nSo the way I look at commodities in the context of systematic macro is really how do I strip out of commodities all those micro effects and to some extent the macro effects that can be expressed in other markets, and what am I left with, and that I think is really where ultimately the linkage is, and one that you really probably don't want to be ignoring.\nWe didn't really dive into it with your background, but you have actually worn both hats in designing transparent bank QIS products as well as running performance fee capital at a hedge fund in the past, both in the commodity space.\nHow does the role difference change your appetite for esoteric signals, complexity, and liquidity risks generally?\nJust how does it change how you think about strategy design when you're sitting in these different roles?\nI think the products are really different in their detail and as a result to whom they cater to.\nWhen you buy a bank QIS product, what you're looking at is a product that's basically designed to provide maximal transparency, often times, certainly in commodity space, daily liquidity.\nWhen I say maximal transparency, usually you as an investor will end up with a very fat index handbook which details exactly what happens in all kinds of corner cases to the index that reflects the strategy that you're implementing in swap.\n\n\nSo, maximum transparency there. You're also typically looking at a product which has been vetted for liquidity. Truth be told, most banks, this is a business that is operationally intensive. It's legally intensive. It has to scale for the economics to add up. So no bank is necessarily interested in designing a very complicated index for a QIS strategy that can't hold significant assets. So those are all really positive, important aspects for an investor. And as do most things in life, everything has its upsides. It also has its potential downsides, right? Because not every strategy is necessarily QIS capable. We were talking earlier on about Vlag trading systems. Depends on the frequency, on the turnover, on the cost structure, whether such a system in a particular parameterization is relevant to a particular bank to cost into a QIS product. And again, the answer for one bank might be different to another bank, but that just does not hold when you start looking at hedge fund strategies. When you have looking at hedge fund strategies, you aren't passing on a rulebook that might be hundreds of pages thick to a client. You ultimately do have that level of indirection, that level of discretion around the edges. You can see whether a particular strategy might be particularly relevant in a market that is just not so liquid. You can decide that just because something's been working for two months systematically, you might still include it. Whereas most bank products ultimately will require multi-year back tests and you do not need to necessarily provide daily liquidity on the close. There's no commitment to do that. So the level of flexibility that you have ultimately is very different. And it means as well that the types of strategies that you might be choosing to embed in a systematic hedge fund strategy will be different because the cost structure is potentially quite different. So lots of significant differences there. It's really in the eye of the beholder and what the beholder is looking for. In our precall, you joke that you were originally hired for skills that are now largely obsolete. But in contrast to that, rough path theory, which is what you spent most of your time working on as a grad student, is suddenly now back fashionable in the machine learning landscape. From your perspective, what do you think is the most exciting frontier where advanced mathematics and modern compute might open up entirely new commodity strategies over the next decade? Yeah, I mean I think probably one of the biggest areas and richest hunting grounds in commodities is both the v space and getting more granular in terms of time structure. So when I say time structure, what I mean is moving from extra day to intraday strategies. And you know what's interesting I think in particular about the rough path angle is that it allows as well in combination with the higher frequency of available data the inclusion of a broader cross-sectional set of assets and I think this is kind of where there's potentially a lot of really quite interesting relationships which have hitter really gone probably unnoticed because quite frankly you just can't have a human eye at all time scales on all kinds of different things. And as compute power picks up, the ability to parimoniously summarize dynamic relationships as is done for instance in rough paths is going to open up a lot of new interesting avenues from a signal generation perspective. I want to finish off with the same question I've been asking everyone for this season, which is outside of work, what are you most passionate and excited about today? It could be a new hobby, idea, book, show, music, something related to family. What really has you most excited?\n I'm going to give you a very straightforward time accute answer here, Corey. It's probably about 95 degrees outside my 245 Park Avenue office. I am super excited on getting on my bus home and going to the pool this evening with my kids. Can't wait for that to happen. But a bit bigger picture, one thing that I have found myself spending an inordinate amount of time on is the various uses of chat sheet and tea both in my professional life but also in my personal life. And the multitude of potential applications just abounds and is something that I find just so extremely exciting.\n Well, Ben, thank you so much for taking the time to come chat today. I really appreciate it.\n Same. Corey, thanks for having me and speak soon.\n",
