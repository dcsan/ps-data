  "cleanText": "For decades, Israel has wanted the support of the US in bombing the Iranian nuclear program. And for decades, every single US president has said no. I have always said that all options are on the table, but the first option for the United States is to solve this problem diplomatically. Military action would be far less effective than this deal in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Senses want an attack on Iran nuclear sites by Israel.\n\nThe answer is no. And then last week, one President Donald Trump said yes. Breaking news. And after days of uncertainty, the US has completed three strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. It's mission accomplished for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who thanked President Trump today. Your bold decision to target Iran's nuclear facilities with the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history. Iran's response came in the form of a missile strike targeting Aloud air base in Qatar, the largest US military base in the Middle East. Experts call this attack mostly symbolic. Qatar did get a heads up hours in advance. Seconds ago, the president went to Truth Social and typed this. It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire. A mutual ceasefire between Israel and Iran is now officially in effect. But it appears the terms might have already been violated this morning. You know what? We have we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing. Do you understand that? How much damage has been done? This is a real question. It's also a political question. The Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed that the core components of Iran's nuclear program are largely intact and that Iran's nuclear program has essentially only been set back by months. So, why did Donald Trump say yes? And what are the long-term consequences of that decision going to be? My guest today is Aaron David Miller, who worked on negotiations and policy in the Middle East across four successive presidencies from 1985 to 2003.\n\nHe's since written a number of excellent books on the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians and American leadership. And he's a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And he joins me to talk through what all this has meant for a region that is in profound flux.\n\n[Music]\n\nAaron David Miller, welcome back to the show. Great to be here with you, Isra.\n\nSo, we're speaking here on the morning of Tuesday, June 24th right now. Just let's start with where your head is at. What are you confident the bombings achieved? What do you What are your big points of uncertainty right now? Give me your overview of the landscape. Yeah, you know, first of all, I don't believe in game changers, inflection points, sea changes, and transformation. Most of what happens in life is transactional, whether it's marriage, diplomacy, business, and it certainly applies to the Middle East. Big changes have been a foot since October 7. And I would argue there's some trend line headlines and trend lines that have never existed before. The first is Israel's escalation dominance, which I think is the most important thing that has happened. And everything that we're now talking about Ezra flows from the notion that for the first time in its history, Israel controls the pace, the focus, the intensity of military conflict with its three key adversaries, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. The Houthis are provide somewhat of an exception because of the distance problem. But the reality is the Israelis can ex escalate in ways that these three adversaries cannot. And the Israelis can deter that escalation which I think is what we witnessed in the during the course of the last 12 days.\n\nSo right now I think you you see a situation where a situational and transactional President Donald Trump who has no real effective strategy, no grand design with respect to what to me is this broken, angry and dysfunctional region where by and large American ideas on war making and peacemaking have gone to die. But he has managed as a consequence of Israel's escalation dominance which he was wary about and has been for the last six months to ride the tiger of Israel's owning the skies. As one Israeli retired general put it, we're playing soccer with the Iranians, but the only difference is they don't have a goalie. He's managed to ride the tiger of Israeli escalation dominance in Lebanon against Hezbollah and now in Iran. And I think he now fashions himself and sees a moment that arguably is historic. And he has expectations which probably go well beyond his capacity to formulate an effective strategy in this region to turn that escalation dominance into what? Transactional arrangements, understandings, political accommodations, even peace treaties. So, I think we're on the cusp of something that has enormous potential. The real question is whether or not we have the leaders in Israel, among the Palestinians, in Iran, and in Washington that know how to use that moment. Unless there is leadership designed to implement something more coherent and cohesive and enduring, you and I probably are going to be having the same conversation next year at this time. What does Israel want and what does Iran want? You know, the Israeli calculation is is a complicated one. Benjamin Netanyahu I think high on the notion of what the Israeli military has achieved in Gaza at tremendous cost to be sure, among Palestinian civilians in Lebanon and in Iran now sees a moment to emerge and to essentially realize one of his two major foreign policy goals and that is to free the people of Israel, the state of Israel from the shadow of an Iranian bomb. Aspirationally, I think he wants to see a different regime in Thran, but he'd probably settle making a virtue out of necessity of whatever damage the Israelis and and Americans have managed to do to Iran's nuclear program. And let's be clear, the only person I trust on this right now is Raphael Gi, who's head of the IAEA, and even he is Can you say what that is? Yeah. The international atomic energy agency. Even GCI is unsure about the degree of damage and destruction that the Israeli and American effort has done to the program. And if GCI is unsure and and I think again I trust him more than the president's assessment, we have to quote totally obliterated Iran's nuclear program. I think that's wrong. I think Iran right now, Ezra, is a nuclear weapons threshold state. That is to say, it has all of the elements that are required to assemble a nuclear weapon. And again, the kind of nuclear weapon that we dropped on Hiroshima Nagasaki, not a sophisticated weapon that could be a miniaturaturized warhead, a physics package that could actually be on top of a missile, but dropped from a plane. Whether it's 6 months, 8 months, a year, 2 years, I think Iran has the capacity. The question that everyone asks is the Iranians have chosen so far to remain my image here. One screwdriver's turn away from producing such a weapon and they're still not there. So Netanyahu would like a different regime. I think he understands that's very difficult. Had this continued maybe he could have gotten regime destabilization dysfunction.\n\nNot going to get regime change it seems to me. Netanyahu won't give up on the regime change and let's be clear the longest governing prime minister in the state history of the state of Israel on trial for bribery fraud and trust in a Jerusalem district accord 5 years running the most ruthless politically savvy politician in Israel today sits a stride Israeli politics and the US-Israeli relationship for now like some sort of colossus and it is extraordinary to me given the disasters of October 7 that there has been absolutely no accountability for this intelligence failure, no accountability for the fact that the prime minister, in my judgment, I'm an American here. I don't play an Israeli despite some of my critics on TV or in the media. This prime minister has managed to prioritize not ending in the war of go in Gaza in large part because of his politics and the the right-wing coalition over whom he presides. He's prided I think and prioritized avenging the dead rather than redeeming the living. And the fate of those people gets sadder and more tragic and more fraught every single day that they remain in God. So Netanyahu I think comes out of this for now extraordinarily powerful. An 86-year-old Ali Kami the supreme leader made a judgment to respond in a way that's calibrated not to validate Iran's honor. It's too late for that. The Israelis have revealed its sheer vulnerabilities and weaknesses but to preserve the regime. My friend Karim Sajjapur from Carnegie, my colleague argues that even the most extreme revolutionaries the day after the revolution become conservatives because preserving and conserving the resol revolution and that is Alham's objective becomes if you're a Star Trek fan the prime directive. To what degree are we looking now at a new Middle East? You talked about Israel's an almost hegemonic military force. You have Iran which has seen its proxies functionally devastated particularly Hezbollah. But also its own power revealed as much weaker than people thought say 5 years ago. And you have the Gulf States which are in a very different place than they were 10 15 years ago. You think about where the Gulf States were in 2000. They are richer. Their relationships with Israel and America are much much stronger. They've modernized in many ways that would have been unthinkable back then. When you think about the geopolitics of the Middle East that you worked on for much of your career and you look at how it looks now, what what makes it different and what possibilities and dangers are opened up by that? I mean the one continuity between the the period the mid-80s to 2003 when I left government one continuity at least in in terms of what how you could produce a new Middle East. I don't believe in it because in in a way the in so many respects this is a broken angry and dysfunctional part of the world. You have five Arab states Libya, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon in various phases of state dysfunction. You have extractive leaders and authoritarians just about everywhere. Hopes of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt have been essentially overturned. The authoritarians reign just about everywhere. You've got gender inequality, you've got key the key major terrorist groups still emanate in the CIA's rankings from from this region. I would have argued and still do even though Iran has been hollowed out that the following that in the old days Iraq, Syria and Egypt were the three prominent Arab states that vi for influence and power. Right now, in my judgment, Iraq and Syria are basically offline. They cannot project their power. Although there may be some hope in Syria for a better ending to what happens when an authoritarian is is thrown out of office. I'm keeping my expectations pretty low there. And Egypt which is burdened with many many problems and and no longer despite its geographic centrality and the peace treaty with Egypt no longer is the central actor in US foreign policy. When we traveled when I traveled with half a dozen secretaries of state George Schultz through Coen Powell the first stop we always made was Cairo not the case anymore it's the Gulf. So this fracture, this dysfunction in the Arab world has led to two important changes. The one you referred to is the Gulf. It's stable. Authoritarians who can make decisions. It's rich. It's got hydrocarbons. The Emirates and the Saudis are vying to become the new entropose of the financial world. That's one power standard that has emerged. But these are also very weak states with respect to geographic proximity to the Iranians. The other argument I would make is the rise of the three non-Arabs, Turkey, a member of NATO, Israel, America's closest ally, and Iran on their back foot to be sure to say the least. But the three non-Arabs are are still keepers. They're not going anywhere. The only three states in this region that can project their power abroad. They all have tremendous economic potential. They all have competent militaries and intelligence security organizations and they have and can have tremendous influence for good and for real. So those are the changes that I I I think are a foot. Again converting what we've seen since October 7 and in in the wake of the last 12 days into something that normal humans would regard as functional agreements the end of conflict governing empty spaces when things change. If you want to talk about the new Middle East in any serious way, you really need to talk about leadership. Leaders who are masters of their political houses, not prisoners of their ideologies or their politics. Leaders who are prepared to risk but leaders who care about the security and prosperity of their publics rather than prioritizing keeping their seats. And the reality is when I look around in this region, I I don't see that kind of leadership. Which is why converting escalation dominance into lasting political arrangements, let alone peace treaties, cannot be done without leaders. In Israel, we do not have one. Among the Palestinians, that is so fraught. The Palestinians are faced with an unpalatable choice between MAbas on one hand and Hamas on the other. And they won't they won't get to choose because the notion of elections or a coherent Palestinian governing authority right now basically is is a thought experiment. There's a degree of dysfunction here which isn't going away. Your colleague Steven Warheimr made an argument I thought was interesting. He wrote that Israel acted less to preempt an Iranian bomb than to preempt American diplomacy. A new nuclear deal would have lifted sanctions on Iran's battered economy, helped it to recover and grow. A deal would have stabilized Iran's position in the Middle East and potentially strengthened it over time precisely by succeeding in preventing Iran from going nuclear. A deal would have advanced Iran's integration into the region. In this telling, Netanyahu's real aim here is keeping Iran isolated and weak. Do you buy that? I mean, I I buy the the the final comment and I and I like and admire Stephen. Um I don't buy the argument because I've been around negotiations for a very long time. I understand what is required. Mostly we failed the negotiations that I was a part of with the exception of four extraordinary years under Bush 41 and James Baker. The last time I might add, we were admired, feared, and respected as a great power. But and I've not been involved during the Obama and Biden administrations in Iranian and US negotiations. But the reality is you want to make a negotiation work, you need four things. You need two parties who are willing and able. You need a sense of urgency. You need a mediator who's prepared at at the right times to apply ample amounts of vinegar and ample amounts of honey. And you need a balance a a negotiation and an endgame of the negotiation based on a balance of interests. The last five rounds of Trump administration neg\n\n\nNegotiations mediated primarily by Steven Whitov, the envoy for everything in my judgment, given what was on the table, never had a chance of succeeding. The ultimate bridge between Iran's demand, obsession, determination against every conceivable force and odds to maintain its right to enrich and actually to enrich fundamentally came in conflict with the Trump administration's notion that no, Iran will have zero enrichment capacity and forget the right, the capacity, the actual reality, quality of enriching on Iranian soil. They never figured out how to bridge that gap. And you can't do this in six rounds of negotiation separated by a week and a half. You needed more time, a more serious effort, and a willingness on each side to be more flexible. And since there is no trust, no confidence, since the prime directive for the Iranians is he pulled out of the last agreement, how are we going to ensure that he won't pull out of this one problem? The Iranians view of negotiating with Americans um was uh I think traumatized by the withdrawal. So you had a lot of odds stacked against you and and yes there's no question that that negotiation impass afforded both Netanyahu and President Trump an opportunity to essentially deal with the problem in in a different way. I do not subscribe to the narrative that a clever, crafty Israeli prime minister willfully sandbagged a naive president into abandoning negotiations which were somehow on the cusp of a major breakthrough. Trump played an active role in the fiction and the ruse that the Israelis required to implement the first phase of their military campaign, which was the decapitation strategy. Trump's insistence uh right up until June 12th, the night of June 12th/13th when the Israeli strikes began, was that there would be a sixth round in Oman. And I I think the Iranians were lulled into believing that there would be no Israeli strike until after those negotiations concluded and the president made a judgment that they had succeeded or fail. So no, Trump rode Netanyahu's Tiger once he saw precisely how much damage, how much skill, how much operational capacity the Israelis had. Fred Zakari had described it as FOMO. That's what that's what essentially motivated Trump. Fear of missing out. He wanted some of that. I do believe Wait, I think you're saying two things that feel like their intention to me. One is that Trump was an active strategic participant creating a ruse to allow Israel to uh execute an attack. Right? We were, you know, it was not long ago that we saw Trump with Netanyahu saying, \"You have to wait. I'm negotiating. I do not want you bombing around.\" Right? Right. That happened in public. It looked like a public rebuke of Netanyahu. So, one version, which you've sometimes heard from the Trump White House, I feel like I'm hearing it from you right now, is this was all a ruse and Trump was strategically operating alongside Netanyahu to lull the Iranians into a false sense of complacency. The other the other interpretation is that Israel acted without the US's full blessing, certainly without our full cooperation. Began the began the bombing and then Trump in some reports watching Fox News seeing how much the Israelis were succeeding in the objective decided to to to jump in and be part of it. Those are two, I think, quite different interpretations of what Trump is doing. Um either which do you subscribe to or how do you synthesize them? Well, timing is a critically important piece here. For the last two months, Trump did warn Netanyahu off. I think the Monday before the Thursday that the Israelis struck, I think he was quite uncertain about whether or not this was a good idea. But let's be clear, Donald Trump in the last two months has done things to Israel and without Israel's coordination and consent that no other American president that I ever worked for, Republican or Democrat, has done. He has essentially undermined two of the three political laws of gravity that have governed the US-Israeli relationship. Number one is the no daylight policy. We must coordinate everything with Israel. Donald Trump sanctioned his own hostage negotiator in March to open up direct negotiations three rounds with Hamas, the external leadership uh over and above Israeli objections or without Israeli even acquiescence. He cut a deal with the Houthis without Israel's knowledge, which essentially implied that as long as the Houthies restrained from attacking US naval assets and US flagged or own commercial shipping, they could basically continue their campaign to launch drones and ballistic missiles at Israel. And he announced in the presence of an Israeli prime minister, probably over his objections, that he was initiating in April a negotiation. And then finally over Netanyahu's objections he lifted quite to the Israeli surprises and most of the surprise of Washington sanctions, lifted sanctions on the regime of Ahmed Shara in Syria so that no daylight policy he blew through the second law of gravity which was attention to domestic political constraints. If a Democrat president had done any of the things I've just identified, let alone all of them, there would probably be a move on the part of the Republicans uh to impeach him. So, Donald Trump, in my judgment, had the personality, had the will to say, at least to the Israeli prime minister, look, I understand what you want to do. You've got a compelling case, but you need to give me more time. You need to give me another two months. But Trump basically handicapped his own argument by setting this completely unrealistic deadline of two months. This was two months to negotiate with Iran. Exactly. And the truth is, we saw it play out in the last 12 hours. He compelled the Israelis to tone down their response to the deaths to ballistic missiles in Beva that caused the deaths of three, four, five Israelis. So, no, I don't I don't buy I but in a large part, what I'm saying to you, I think, is that Donald Trump is transactionally situational. He doesn't have a strategy. There's no core. Biden could not bring himself for over a year to impose a single cost or consequence on Israel that normal humans would regard as serious or sustained pressure. He could have restricted or conditioned US military to Israel. He didn't do that. He could have introduced a UN Security Council resolution or voted for someone else's. He didn't do that. He could have unilaterally recognized Palestinian state. He didn't do that. He could have marshaled a rhetorical campaign day in and day out basically questioning the fact that Israel is not a reliable. He didn't do that. Biden had a core. I'm just reporting here so don't shoot me. Biden had a core. And the core was a deep and abiding emotional and political commitment to the security of Israel, the people of Israel, the idea of Israel. That was Joe Biden in the Senate for decades. That was Joe Biden's father telling him that that silence in the face of evil. The Holocaust is complicity. That's Joe Biden who was a part of Israel's story and felt himself to be a part of that's not Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a transactor. And if you get in the middle between him and something he really wants, this is a president who in six months has sidelined Israel, has pressured Israel, and has supported Israel. Let me let me interrupt this for one second because I think the thing if you've been watching this, you will think hearing this is yes, there are things Donald Trump wanted for America. He wanted to negotiate the return of a hostage. He wanted our shipping to not be endangered by the Houthis. But Donald Trump has put no serious curbs on what Israel is doing in Gaza or the West Bank to to be very clear. And he just gave Israel the thing that all these other presidents, including Joe Biden, for all of his deep-seated Zionism, did not give Israel, which is American participation using our most powerful depth penetrating munitions in a bombing campaign to destroy um as much of Iran's nuclear program as we could. So for all the, you know, Trump does not follow protocol in the way other presidents do. He is much freer with his language than other presidents have been. But if you ask who gave Israel what they really wanted, the thing Netanyahu could not get from George W. Bush, from Barack Obama, from Donald Trump number one, from Joe Biden, it was this. That's my point, though. He removed sanctions on settlers. He restored the shipment of 2,000 lb bombs. He basically has given Israel a free hand in the West Bank. No, no, I'm not here to argue that Donald Trump is somehow only u interest that he's the new Eisenhower that basically he's the only American president ever to threaten serious sustained pressure against state of Israel as Eisenhower did in the wake of Suez. Only one, no American president has gone beyond what Eisenhower was prepared to do. My sense was Donald Trump has no core, which is why he is the ultimate transactor. That he could do both and not blink an eye. That he could basically call up an Israeli prime minister and say, \"Don't overreact. I don't want you. I don't know what the Israelis were prepared to do, but I guarantee you it would have been as devastating a strike in response to the deaths of five Israelis, which were the fifth of all the Israelis who were killed over the course of the last 12 days by Iranian ballistic missiles. It is the absence of a core. It is Trump's response to situations. It's the absence of an effective strategy. And I would have bet you that had the Israelis not struck June 12th, 13th, he would have tried to find a deal with the Iranians that would have parked the nuclear issue. Parked it a transactional deal, not a transformational one. Parked the Iranian issue until the end of his hopefully his final ter his hopefully his final term uh in office. So, I understand exactly what you're saying, and I'm not here to whitewash Donald Trump as someone who is a standup guy when it comes to Israel. And that's not that's exactly the opposite point I'm making. Well, the the thing the thing I'm trying to get at here is because I'm I'm also I don't think you're trying to whitewash Donald Trump. That's not my view. Is that there is a question of whether or not Donald Trump is trying to achieve something here, right? He's been working with Netanyahu hand in glove and maybe it's that he wanted to set back the Iranian nuclear program. Right? You could you could see Donald Trump is acting here with a goal and you could see Donald Trump here as making decisions day by day by day by day without really a theory of how they're all going to work out. And I think what is worth thinking about or the thing I have been trying to think about is Trump just gave Israel something that every other recent president including Donald Trump thought was too risky to give them. And is that because bombing Iran, given Iran's current state, is no longer that large of a risk because they cannot project power as they once could because Israel's decapitated so many of their proxies? Is that because Donald Trump has a higher risk tolerance or wants something different or wants something more than the other presidents did or than he did during his first term? Right. We have just seen a massive change in US policy towards Iran. Well, we went to Yeah, we went to war with Iran. Yes. So, what what is that change in service of? I mean, and how do we know if it will have worked? Well, so but doesn't that offer Well, that's a separate analytical question. The first one is is theoretical. I think Trump saw an opportunity and he and he took it. Was Trump right to take the opportunity? Well, that's another question as to whether or not what we have done ultimately will down to an advancement of American national interest or retardation of those interests. What is our interest? We have well I I would reduce our interest in the Middle East without being sentimental. Our vital interests. That is vital regarding a situation where American presidents would would risk putting Americans harm in harm's way. We have three interests in the Middle East. Number one, counterterrorism. Number two, maintaining access to hydrocarbons. And number three, ensuring that there is no regional hegeimon with a nuclear weapon. That's that's not to say we don't have array of other interests. I worked on one of those interests for my entire career, but it was never deemed to be a vital national interest, which is one of the reasons I think that in so many administrations there was never a serious effort to look at the Israeli, Palestinian, Arab-Israeli issue as a national interest, particularly at the end of the cold war. It was viewed as a discretionary problem. It would be nice to have. You say one of our vital interests is preventing the emergence of a regional hegeimon, probably in this case Iran, with a nuclear weapon. First, why is that our vital interest? I mean, it seems obvious, but I think it's worth spelling it out because as much as Trump did diverge from other presidents here, not allowing Iran to develop a nuclear weapon has been a very very consistent view of of every recent American president. And second, when you say there can be no regional hegeimon with a nuclear weapon militarily, isn't Israel a regional hegeimon with nuclear weapons? Yeah. I mean, I use the term escalation dominance. I probably shouldn't have used the term regional ham. Israel is not a regional hedgeimon the way the former Soviet Union was in Eastern Europe. But Iran wasn't going to get there either with a weapon, right? But it Iran would emerge, my definition is Iran, Iran emerges in a in a competitive and antagonistic way as a threat as a threat to Saudi Arabia. Uh as a threat to Israel's spreading its ideology and fighting an expansionary power with a nuclear weapon. Yeah, that'd be a better way to frame it, right? Yeah. An expansionary power with a nuclear weapon, right? Because that that threatens our core interests. I mean Iran is clearly has an ideology which seeks uh to influence uh and convert the so-called Shia access Baghdad Beirut uh uh sana sana with the Houthis um Damascus that that seems a stretch these days in large part given Russian retrenchment given Ahmed Shara's rise you're now talking basically about a Sunni regime in in in um in Syria. I don't see and you you now have the hollowed out of Iran's ability to project its power abroad. So I don't think that is as as critical in interest. But Iran's pursuit of the weapon and Iran 90 million people, Iran's a keeper. It's been a keeper for centuries. It's a real country. Is Israel an expansionary power with a nuclear weapon? Israel has a new definition of border security which I find to be very intriguing. I mean and it goes beyond their security doctrine that they have they they will preempt or prevent. But if you look at what the Israelis have done in Gaza, they are there for an indefinite period of time. In the West Bank, they are now more entrenched than they've ever been since the second inifat. In Lebanon,\n\n\nThey still have not withdrawn from the five strategic points obligated to withdraw, and the Trump administration has acquiesced in that.\nAnd in Syria, they've declared much of the area southwest of Damascus as an Ogo zone.\nIt's a fascinating sort of anticipatory hedge against October 7.\nUh, and partly also because it does advance Israel's operational and offensive capacities.\nSo, an ongoing Israeli-Iranian conflict is basically going to endure even if the Iranians don't make a major effort to try to reconstitute the program or, worse, right, push for an actual weapon.\nAnd as somebody with long experience in the region who has thought deeply about these questions, do you think it served America's national interest to drop bunker buster bombs in Iran?\nGiven the fact that we don't know what the damage was, given the fact that we don't know what the end state is, it's a highly arguable proposition.\nAt the same time, given the result, again, it's, it's, in my case, and I, I want to be honest here.\nI, I would hope, I want to be honest.\nIt reminds me of the guy who jumps off the 10-story building and as he's passing the fifth floor, somebody yells out, \"How you doing?\"\nAnd he responds, \"So far, so good.\"\nI think the case, I think was a judgment call.\nI think that, and it was not a, in my judgment, a slam dunk judgment call.\nI think that on...\nI guess if I were running the railroad, I would have asked for two more months to determine whether or not Iran was serious about this negotiation.\nI would have probably varied what I would put on the table in an effort to get the Iranians to agree.\nIt wouldn't have been anything like the JCPOA.\nUh, and then, which was the Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran that Trump ripped up, right?\nIf the Iranians were not interested, uh, I think I would have agreed with the decision.\nSo, there, there's an argument, you've heard it made recently from a number of Democrats, that look, Obama signed this deal with Iran that a lot of other countries were counterparties in this deal in some way or another.\nWe had inspectors there.\nThere was a framework.\nThere was a structure.\nTrump ripped it up and then was trying to make a new deal that sounded kind of like the JCPOA, um, and then ended up bombing during the deal-making process, which probably makes it, makes it very hard to imagine that you will ever convince Iran back to the table in the future.\nSo, first, do you buy the argument that the deal we had was sort of fine and the problem was just Trump ripping it up and causing a problem that he now needed to solve?\nAnd two, since you said if you were running negotiations, you would create something very different, what would have been different about it?\nWell, first of all, the JCPOA was flawed but functional.\nUh, it restrained, it constrained.\nIt, it, um, created a degree of intrusive inspections that I think, frankly, were working.\nThat doesn't mean that the Iranians weren't cheating.\nOf course, they were cheating.\nUm, preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, in my judgment, never had a good answer.\nThis is not the best answer either.\nAnd it leads into the analytical question of how, how do you permanently uh, ensure that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon?\nThere's only one way to do it, and it's, it's tethered to a galaxy far, far away rather than the realities back here on planet Earth, and that is to fundamentally uh, change the regime and uh, create one or the Iranian public will create one that isn't, is not interested in acquiring a nuclear weapon.\nI might add, the Shah was well on his way and wanted one as well.\nUm, Iran has a profound sense of entitlement and insecurity.\nThat is a very bad combination uh, in, in any nation.\nProfound entitlement and profound insecurity.\nAnd I think that the Iranian program is not dead.\nIt hasn't been totally obliterated.\nThe 800 lb of highly enriched uranium fissile material went missing.\nWhere is it?\nHow many centrifuges, advanced centrifuges, uh, survived?\nIranians, I think, over time, even though it'll be very difficult given Israel's command of the airspace, but if they don't uh, deal with the IAEA any longer or they withdraw from the NPT, the non-proliferation treaty, you can see that this operation, which is now being touted as uh, a, a, an unqualified success, I, I, I certainly wouldn't call it that, uh, is going to be looked at quite differently, which...\nWhich is why in the end, Ezra, it comes, we come back to the same, to, in my judge, we talk about the new Middle East, we come back to the same two unanswered questions.\nHow do you translate this escalation dominance into something more enduring that reflects a better balance of interests?\nAnd number two, do you have the leaders to convert that?\nAnd I, you know, I, it seems to me we don't.\nBenjamin Netanyahu is not interested.\nHe's already demolished Israel's enemies.\nNow he seeks to become the peacemaker.\nI don't see it because it assaults at least one of the core principles, which is there is not going to be a Palestinian state, and there will be no division of East Jerusalem, and there will be no major Israeli concessions with territorial concessions on the West Bank.\nI don't see it among the Palestinians.\nUh, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86.\nEvery Iranian expert I talk to tells me that if there is regime change, it's likely to be, particularly in this environment, it's going to be an IRGC heavily militarized, securityized regime, and figure that the only, borrowing a page out of Gaddafi's book, the one Gaddafi didn't read, but one that one Kim Jong-un did read, basically, you need a new, you need a nuclear weapon to guard against, hedge against regime change.\nI don't see the leadership.\nI want to say, from my perspective, I just claim no knowledge of how any of this will turn out.\nI like, I, I feel very, I've actually felt, even in preparing for this conversation, it's just, it's hard to find anything that feels like strong commentary to me because everybody's just speculating.\nEzra, you're, I mean, Ezra Klein, you're a very wise man.\nIt's, it's, if, and one of the lessons I've learned after decades of failure in negotiations, you really, you really need to respect, not admire, not countenance, but respect the degree of difficulty that the issues and the leaders in this part of the world pose.\nIt is more often than not a place where American ideas on war making and peacemaking go to die.\nNo one that I know, and I'll put myself at the top of the list, is prepared to make predictions, hard and fast predictions.\nThe Israelis now believe that what's happened to Iran is going to open the door to a dramatic expansion of the Abraham Accords.\nI don't know exactly what Middle East they're looking at.\nOne version of what just happened.\nUm, there's a sort of precedent in, in Israel bombing the Iraqi nuclear program back in the 80s.\nIs this sets things back quite a bit, and it just kind of defers it, and people are able to keep it contained and keep it in a box?\nThere is a tension there.\nI mean, you've spoken to the Israelis about the Iranians much more than I have, but I've spoken to them enough about the Iranians that the completely universal opinion within the Israeli security class is that America does not understand Iran.\nIran is a patient, strategic power with an imperialistic past and deeply ideological hegemonic ambitions, and they will wait, and they will strategize, and they will act on a longer time frame than America ever acts upon.\nIt seems to me that if you believe that, then a bombing campaign that, you know, depending on who you believe, set Iran back 6 months, 2 years, but at the same time made it almost impossible for the Iranians to ever trust diplomacy with us again, you're sort of knocked out the idea of a deal.\nAnd so what you're left with, either regime change or the expectation that the thing Iran is not going to do is wait one screwdriver turn away that when the new hardliners come in or when there's quieter, is, or America is distracted by something else, they're going to sprint to a bomb.\nAnd that what they'll do is what Pakistan did, what North Korea did, which is like emerge one day and say, \"We've got one now.\"\nAnd so now you can't attack us.\nNow, maybe that doesn't happen, but that seems very plausible from where we sit.\nBecause making, making diplomacy into a ruse seems like it has at least one very obvious problem, which is if you ever need diplomacy in the future, how do you persuade your counterparty it's not again a ruse?\nWell, ever is a very long time.\nSure.\nUm, declaring the end of anything is uh, is a hard proposition because the truth is neither you nor I can see what's in front of us.\nI was in Israel on October 6, 1973.\nRight until now, the greatest intelligence failure in the history of the state of Israel, and within six years, I watched Sadat, Begin, and Carter sign a full treaty of peace on the White House lawn, September 13th, 1993.\nAnd in that case, trauma for the Israelis turned to hope.\nI sat on the White House lawn on October, uh, September 13th, 1993, watching Rabin and Arafat, Clinton sign the Oslo Declaration of Principles.\nAnd yet everything on that day now lies somewhere broken, bloodied, and battered.\nIn that case, hope turned to trauma.\nSo what do you conclude from this?\nWell, you conclude that we occupy a tiny space on the planet for a very short period of time.\nYou can say you never say never.\nThat is a very strong proposition in my of my worldview.\nI have, I have two kids and four grandkids.\nI'm not going to mortgage their futures by saying the American republic is doomed to failure or Israelis and Palestinians cannot find a way forward.\nI, I don't have the right, the moral right to do that.\nSo, in answer to your question, I've been around the Middle East to know it doesn't offer up very often transformative, happy, or Hollywood endings to everything.\nSo, when people talk about a new Middle East, I shake my head, but I listen.\nI listen a lot more now.\nI have a lot more uncertainty and a lot more humility.\nBut this is one complicated region, and uh, we are like very often a modern-day Gulliver wandering around in a part of the world that we don't understand, tied up by tiny powers, some large, some small, whose interests are not our own, and more than that, as burdened in essence by our own illusions.\nDonald Trump, unlike any American president that I ever worked for, doesn't look, let's be very clear, doesn't look at Israel the way any other American president looked at Israel.\nI don't think he has this emotional, sentimental view of the Israeli story.\nI don't think he's that attached to the idea of Israel as Biden was.\nThe identity, the security, the people of Israel, because I don't think Donald Trump is attached to much beyond his own immediate circumstances.\nI think that is a place to end.\nOh, was our final question.\nWhat are three books you'd recommend to the audience?\nI actually prepared for this.\nI have two books.\nThe rest you're just winging.\nI have two books on how to do successful Middle East diplomacy since that's what kind of we're talking about.\nMartin Indig's Master of the Game, Henry Kissinger and the art of Middle East diplomacy, and Peter Baker and Susan Glasser's masterful The Man Who Ran Washington, Life at Times of James Baker.\nThose are two books I would recommend about, there are real lessons there about how to do successful diplomacy.\nI have a third book, uh, one that isn't out yet, that argues that the US, including many who worked on that this process for a very long time, has gotten it profoundly and utterly wrong when it comes to peacemaking.\nIt's called Tomorrow is Yesterday, Life, Death, and the Pursuit of Peace in Israel, Palestine, by Hussein Agha, and full disclosure, my friend of many years, uh, Robert Mi.\nThose are the three I would look at.\nAaron David Miller, thank you very much.\nEzra, you're great.\nPhenomenal questions.\nLove the conversation.\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nHey, hey, hey, hey.\n[Music]\n",
