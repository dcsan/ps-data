  "cleanText": "There's this old joke.\nA conspiracy theorist dies and goes to heaven.\nWhen he gets to the pearly gates, God says, \"Welcome. You can ask me one question. I'll tell you anything you want to know.\"\nThe guy says, \"I have to know who really killed JFK.\"\nGod says, \"It was Lee Harvey Oswald and he acted alone.\"\nThe man pauses for a moment, then looks up and says, \"Wow, this goes even higher than I thought.\"\n\nNew details this morning in the case of Jeffrey Epstein.\nA review from the Justice Department and FBI did not find any evidence that notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein kept a so-called client list.\nAn unsigned memo that rules out any smoking gun.\nThat review found, in short, nothing.\nNo client list, no evidence of blackmail, no evidence of foul play in Epstein's death.\nThe memo goes on to explain why further files will not be released by the Trump administration.\nInformation related to Epstein's victims is quote intertwined throughout the materials.\nIt says, \"One of our highest priorities is combating child exploitation and bring justice to victims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\nSo I guess case closed.\nNah, I'm just kidding.\nMAGA is tearing itself apart over this.\nHow many of you are not satisfied with the results of the investigation?\nPeople are absolutely not going to accept just a memo that was written that says there is no client list.\nAnd I've got to be honest, I blame Pam Bondi.\nTo me, her days are numbered 100%.\nAre you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?\nThis guy's been talked about for years.\nNew theories are spinning out to try to explain it all.\nMaybe Donald Trump is on the list.\nMaybe Donald Trump or his administration is being blackmailed by the intelligence services.\nMaybe Donald Trump is now himself using that list to blackmail others.\nMaybe it's all part of the plan.\nOr maybe there was no list.\nMaybe magazite were always playing their followers for fools.\nThe juicing of the Epstein conspiracy, the promise that there was this list and it would be released was not a small project confined to a few outliers in the movement.\nThis one went right to the top.\nRelease the list.\nSeriously, we need to release the Epstein list.\nThat is an important thing.\nMAGA has a cosmology.\nIt has a mythology.\nThere is a corrupt elite in the most extreme forms.\nIt is a corrupt pedophilic elite.\nAnd that elite controls everything.\nAnd Donald Trump as a person and MAGA as a movement are justified in doing anything they need to do to break that elite's control and return this country to the people.\nThere's a problem that movements like this face when they take power.\nWhat happens when the conspiracy isn't there?\nWhat happens when you declassify the files and there's nothing in them?\nWhat happens if you read the files and you realize that for there's some reason you can't release them?\nWhat happens when you become the system?\nWhat happens when you become the corrupt elite?\nBecause here is the thing, Donald Trump is a corrupt elite.\nHe is now, he always has been selling out the people who believe in him.\nLiberals always want to make this point in the framework we have of the world in the way we see him selling people out.\nHere's my version of it or one of them.\nTrump is a champion right now of people who are heavily dependent on Medicaid, on food assistance.\nHe just absolutely screwed them.\nHe cut about a trillion dollars of Medicaid and food assistance to finance what?\nTax cuts for him and his rich friends.\nHe did that while saying publicly denying that he was cutting Medicaid, lying to the people who believed in him.\nIn my framework of the world, that's corruption.\nThat is what the worst elites do when they get power.\nThey take money from people who need it and line their own pockets.\nBut that's not how the cosmology of MAGA works.\nHis hardest core supporters had a story about what the problem was.\nAnd that story wasn't in the tax code or the safety net.\nFor them, the problem was a conspiracy that reached to the highest levels of the American government.\nAnd then Trump appointed people like Cash Patel and Danino to office.\nPeople had been spreading and giving attention to those theories for years.\nYou don't think that Bill Gates is lobbying Congress night and day to prevent the disclosure of that list?\nThere's a big assumption out there that these videotapes were exclusively in the custody of Epstein.\nThat's a huge mistake.\nBy elevating Patel and Beagino, the message was Trump knew what the problem was, too, and he was going to fix it.\nAnd then he didn't fix it.\nAnd now he's lashing out at his own supporters for believing a story that he and the people around him were perfectly happy to promote when it served their interests.\nNow he's telling those supporters, it's just the radical left telling you this.\nThey want to talk about the Epstein hooks.\nAnd the sad part is it's people that are really doing the Democrats work.\nThey're stupid people.\nYeah.\nGo ahead.\nI think I should say before I start this episode where I am on the Epstein story.\nIf you force me to give you my best guess given what we know, I think this guy had a lot of very powerful friends.\nI think this guy was a predator and a pedophile on an extraordinary scale.\nAnd I think those sides of his life were mostly separate.\nI don't think there is a list of bold-faced names somewhere.\nThe reason I don't think there's a list is there's been a lot of big law firms hunting for cases here.\nThere is a lot of money to be made in suing anyone connected to Epstein.\nVery, very powerful firms.\nTo say nothing of big media organizations, firms and organizations that have the money to hire the best investigators, the best journalists, they're just not finding it.\nDoes that explain everything?\nNo.\nDoes it resolve everything?\nNo.\nDoes a plea deal Epstein got in Florida look weirdly sweet?\nYeah, it does.\nDoes Epstein's death seem weird to me?\nIt does.\nThere is a remainder, a remnant.\nThey'll probably never be resolved here.\nWe will never get satisfaction.\nBut I don't find it easy to resolve that remnant in a conspiracy so total.\nThe no government, no law firm, no media organization seems able to breach it.\nBut what MAGA wanted out of the Epstein case wasn't just answers.\nIt was the same thing it wanted out of QAnon.\nA story that collapsed reality down to something that is well-ordered.\nA world where the problems resolve down to a few villains.\nA world where someone is in charge.\nAnd maybe that someone right now is evil.\nBut if you could find them, expose them, replace them with someone good, then we would finally be able to fix all of this.\nWhat is a fantasy of Donald Trump if not that I alone can fix it?\nBut now Donald Trump is pitting himself against that fantasy.\nThe reason the fizzling of the Epstein cases mattered in MAGA is that it does something worse than undermine a conspiracy theory.\nIt undermines a worldview.\nI want to talk about that worldview and how it has been consistent.\nHow it has animated MAGA for years now.\nMy guest today is Will Sommer who has been tracking conspiracies for a long time.\nHe's a reporter at The Washington Post.\nHe's now at the Bullwork and he's the author of the book Trust the Plan: The Rise of QAnon and the Conspiracy That Unhinged America.\n\n[Music]\n\nWill Sommer, welcome to the show.\nThanks for having me.\nSo, I want to begin in the dominant conspiracy theory of Donald Trump's first term.\nWhat for the uninitiated was QAnon?\nSure.\nSo QAnon in sort of a nutshell is this idea that Donald Trump was recruited by the the military to take on this sort of pedophile cabal that runs the world or you know what we might also call the deep state.\nUh, and Trump supporters got this idea because of someone named Q who was posting online starting in late 2017 with these kind of cryptic messages and then they would decode them and that's really sort of what formed the basis of QAnon to the extent QAnon developed a fully fleshed out mythology.\nTell me what that story was.\nWho who was in it?\nI mean, what what did a what did a serious QAnon believer by late 2020 believe was going on?\nSo, they believe QAnon believers, they believe basically that the world is full of symbols and horrors that they can decode.\nUm and what they come to believe is uh that powerful elites uh sexually abuse and murder children in satanic rituals and they drink their blood or this substance called adrenochrome to stay that they kind of that exists but not in the way they think it does.\nThat they believe is a sort of fountain of youth.\nAnd so that people with with talk shows or or bankers or celebrities, they are just regularly drinking children's blood to stay young forever.\nUm and so QAnon, needless to say, had become very complex uh and Baroque.\nBut they also believed, you know, just really random crazy things like they believed um, you know, that the the government was controlling the weather through chemtrails, you know, clouds in the sky, or they believed that if a celebrity wore red shoes, you know, relatively common color of shoe, that that was a symbol that they drink children's blood.\nUm, so there were there was this whole universe of beliefs that they had about um, you know, sort of nefarious things that the Cabal had done.\nWhen you say it like that, it sounds a little hard to believe.\nIt does.\nIt does.\nSo, what gave it its power?\nWhy why was it believed?\nYou know, I think there were a couple things.\nI think the idea of people sort of nefariously abusing children um you know, in the dead of night or or an organization of people.\nI mean, it goes back to the Middle Ages when people would say that Jews were murdering children um to, you know, for Passover.\nUh or, you know, the satanic panic in the 80s, the idea that there were just these satanic cabals across the country.\nI think it is just so emotionally powerful.\nI think, you know, all kind of right-thinking people are really offended by the idea of children being abused.\nAnd I think a lot of Trump supporters had really put an enormous amount of faith in Trump that he would change their lives really materially.\nUm, and then you know when QAnon appears in about 9 months into the first Trump administration, they aren't getting a lot of what they wanted.\nI mean, he's bogged down in the Mueller investigation.\nThe wall hasn't been built.\nHillary Clinton hasn't been locked up.\nUh, and so then suddenly Q shows up and says, \"Well, actually, Hillary Clinton's going to be arrested by the end of the month.\"\nAnd Trump is not, it might seem like he's going to bog down in Washington morass, but really he's at war with essentially satanic forces.\nAnd when he wins, you're going to own your apartment for free.\nYour car loan's going to be cancelled.\nDiseases are going to be cured.\nSo, you can see and there were other things.\nThere were religious elements, a lot of stuff that kind of matched up with what was going on at Fox News at the time.\nAnd so, I I think there was a lot of appeal to people.\nAnd plus it was so it was kind of a game you know there was a community of people decoding the clues together.\nI also think one dimension of both QAnon and then and then Epstein which has more texture of reality to it is that if you think back over the past few decades, there are a huge number of sexual abuse scandals that really did have cover-ups that really did exist in forms of common and elite knowledge that really were grotesque.\nI mean Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, the Catholic Church pedophilia scandal.\nMore recently, we have the Diddy parties that on the one hand Qanon has this outlandishness to it.\nAnd on the other hand, when you think over this period, there actually is a a recurrent pattern of networks of powerful people or at least individual powerful people um abusing women usually, although in the Catholic Church scandal wasn't only women.\nUh and it's not just covering it up, but it being known by other powerful people who did nothing about it.\nThe idea that you cannot trust the elites to police this, there is truth to that.\nI think that is why the in these these scandals, these these sexual abuse uh coverups is part of why QAnon is so is so powerful and resonant with people because people see something true in it um and something that is really real.\nAnd so from my perspective talking to Qanon people, I often feel silly saying like um you know, do you really think you know an institution would would cover up sexual abuse to uh to protect itself or to avoid embarrassment um even at the cost of of more children, more women being abused?\nI mean obviously we know that does happen.\nAnd so in a way that I think if you just said there's a cabal and it's you know putting in green energy or it you know it's offshoring jobs or it's keeping taxes high I think a lot of people particularly the often sort of apolitical people that were activated by QAnon and they wouldn't care understandably but when you say that like the absolute worst things are happening that you can imagine and those people are going to get away with it and they rule over you I think that that really resonates with people.\nI I want to hold on something you said in there that after this satanic pedophile cabal is arrested, maybe your rent will go away, maybe your disease will be cured.\nThere there's a version where there isn't a lot of political import to this that there's a terrible crime happening and it needs to be stopped.\nAnd the final step in the stopping of it is the arresting of all these the arrest of all these child molesters.\nBut there's a politics to Q a sense that on the other side of it lies something for you, the normie or normal or average reader of 8 Chan, the average MAGA supporter.\nExplain that part of it.\nYeah, I'm glad you point that out because that is sort of the the utopian or like messianic aspects of QAnon I think were often underplayed at the time.\nUm there was a moment in QAnon that they they thought would happen called the storm and that would be the day you know all this awful stuff that we in the world the pedophile cabals all this stuff and then there would be a moment called the storm where Trump would arrest and like presumably execute everyone the conservatives didn't like I mean it would be people in the Democratic party in Hollywood in banking uh people like Tom Hanks and Oprah would be sent to Guantanamo Bay for military tribunals Uh and so then after that for everyone left behind life would be pretty sweet.\nUm you know they believed that this cabal was responsible for all the evil in the world all the wars.\nIt was holding back all the cures for all the d\n\n\nDiseases.\nUh, and as you mentioned, uh, that basically the cabal created the concept of debt.\nAnd you might say, who would really believe this stuff?\nBut we know that on January 6th, Ashley Babbot, who died that day, she thought that day was the storm.\nThere was a guy who was part of the mob who had just bought a new car, and someone said, \"How can you afford that?\"\nAnd he said, \"Don't worry, the storm's almost here.\"\nQAnon, I think, was powerful because in part it offered people sort of excuses or or some relief in their lives that the the system or the economy or the government wasn't giving them.\nIn your book, you talk about uh meeting a QAnon believer who had terminal cancer.\nI think it was at a rally.\nCan you tell me that story?\nAbsolutely.\nI mean, this is someone who uh in one of the first QAnon rallies I went to, he said, you know, I have terminal cancer and I'm too poor to afford or excuse me, I should say, he said, I have cancer and I'm too poor to afford the treatments for it.\nAnd in all likelihood, it will kill me relatively soon.\nUm, but the good news is that because Trump is going to bring on the storm, he's going to take down this cabal that's been holding back the cure for cancer.\nAnd, you know, soon enough I'll be back in action and my cancer will be cured.\nAnd so in that way, like, you know, I saw a woman who said, you know, my child has a intellectual disability.\nHe's getting mistreated in school, but the cabal is holding back the cure for autism and Trump's going to find it.\nUh, and so it really reached into people's hearts at and really in places where they were most vulnerable and offered them something.\nWhen you met these people, if I ask you what were they like, I mean, they're different people, but what were they like?\nYeah.\nI mean, I think what would surprise people about QAnon believers is that they I think we're we're used to the the Q shaman, the guy in the paint and the horns or like the January 6th mob and these these people who just look like lunatics, but often they were otherwise totally normal people and very affable.\nUh, you know, they were totally happy to talk with me about QAnon.\nI mean, there was a woman I interviewed before the riot really started at January 6th who was totally nice and said, \"Well, you know, I'm here in DC for January 6th and also I'll be going up to Comet Ping Pong to see the underground child tunnels uh that I believe exists there.\"\nYou know, very nice person.\nAnd then she then went and caught a criminal charge for her role in the riot.\nSo, there was a way that these people were they they exist in the world.\nThey have jobs.\nUm, but they also just have this and frankly a sort of derangement or they exist in another reality.\nAt its peak, how big was QAnon?\nHow many people are we talking about believing in some version of this conspiracy?\nSo, there has been some polling on this, and one that struck out to me was a 2020, excuse me, was a 2021 poll by PRI uh which found that 16% of people of Americans believe that there is a sort of a pedophile cabal that runs the world and 22% believe that the storm is coming.\nThat is a huge number of people.\nWell, when you hear polls like that, do you how literally do you take them?\nBecause I sometimes wonder about being called by a pollster like as a random person like do you believe there's a satanic pedophile cult running the world and like yeah I don't really want to be talking to this person.\nSure I believe, you know, I I never know if I should really believe that almost one out of five of the people I met believed that in a real way or they're signaling or having fun or not thinking about it.\nYeah.\nI I think in my head I kind of subtract a couple points from the the higher numbers uh and and say perhaps, you know, these are people who what does the storm mean to them or maybe they're liberals who believe that Donald Trump runs the pedophile cabal or and that don't really fit into the QAnon framework.\nUm, but I do think, you know, really rigorous, you know, things that have said are you a QAnon believer have found, you know, a couple percentage points of people.\nSo, QAnon begins on very uh esoteric online message boards.\nIt migrates to social media, but but for a while we're mostly talking about random people on the internet stumbling on this thing and getting involved in this strange subculture.\nBut tell me about the way it begins to get picked up by influential people, notable people in the MAGA or sort of right-wing influencer movement.\nSure.\nI mean, it is the the power of QAnon, I think, is that it grew from such a small point.\nA couple posts on 4chan that people initially were saying, you know, this is ridiculous.\nEven the people there discounted them.\nUm, but then it because I think it reached sort of an emotional resonance with people, it starts growing as you said, it gets on YouTube where someone like uh like Roseanne Bar or the the former baseball player Curt Schilling picks it up and from there, you know, it keeps growing.\nYou have people um, you know, picking up the ideas.\nAlex Jones at Infowars, who's obviously a huge vector and a kind of a crossover moment between conspiracy theorists and the broader MAGA movement.\nHe starts getting into it.\nHe starts interviewing like the QAnon experts who are talking about how great it is.\nSo QAnon is is bubbling and and it gets a big boost in 2019 from the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\nUm, but then it really with the pandemic you can look at it and you can see all of these conditions that would lead a conspiracy theory to get really big.\nPeople are at home a lot more so they have more time on the internet.\nPeople are understandably very frustrated with the state of the world and they want answers.\nAnd one of the things that is offering answers is is the world of QAnon.\nThe the pandemic is a a moment um the the writer Anna Merlin has called this conspiracy singularity that things begin to cohere into one overwhelming set of ideas.\nAnd and as you said, I mean, the elites, the government is reaching into your life in a particular way that may that in in a way a direct way that it probably was not in the past, your kid's school is closed, you may have lost your job or or you have to wear a mask, um, and so in this way I think it it bred a lot anger at at the government and elites and people say um, you know, and then Qanon says, well, you know, that Dr. Fouchy guy.\nHe's just not maybe a busy body to you.\nHe's actually part of a very sinister group.\nAnd this isn't just kind of a thing that happened to us that we all have to live through.\nThere are these specific people who caused it and we can go get them.\nOne thing that began happening with QAnon is that not just influencers, but Donald Trump himself began sending signals that he was hearing them, that maybe he agreed with them, that maybe this was true.\nHow would you describe that relationship between Trump himself and QAnon?\nSure.\nSo for QAnon believers, acknowledgement from Trump is like the most important thing because they're in their lives and people are saying this thing you believe is so dumb.\nHow could you believe that?\nAnd then they so they they but you know it's all based around Trump.\nSo if Trump said it's real, then they're confirmed.\nAnd so initially they were saying, \"Oh, you know, he used the number 17 or he waved his hand like a Q.\nThey were so desperate for this.\"\nAnd so he's already getting asked about this in the 2020 election and people would say, well, you know what, an interviewer would say, what do you think about QAnon?\nYou know, these are the people who think you're after the pedophile cabal and you know, isn't that ridiculous?\nAnd he would say, I do know they are very much against pedophilia.\nThey fight it very hard, but I know nothing about it.\nAnd you know, just from Qanon believers I talked to, that really improved their faith in QAnon and and helped them continue holding on to it for a while.\nAnd then you also have Trump associates like Cash Patel who in the case of uh True Social, Trump's social network when it was launched and Cash Patel said, you know, I think people are having fun with Q and I think also that you know I don't really follow him.\nWe try to incorporate it into our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences because whoever that person is has certainly captured a widespread breath of the the MAGA and the America First movement.\nBasically says I want this to be a home for things like QAnon.\nSo the promise of Qanon in this whole period is there will eventually be the storm.\nA lot of what you're seeing happening in the Trump administration, a lot of the flailing around, a lot of the apparent chaos behind it, there is a plan.\nTrust the plan is one of the big watch terms of of QAnon.\nThen you have the 2020 election.\nDonald Trump loses.\nHe has his own conspiracy theory theory about whether he lost, but he he loses.\nThere is no storm.\nJanuary 6 happens.\nPeople are arrested for it.\nYou know they they do storm the capital, but they do not take over the government.\nWhat happens to QAnon after that?\nRight?\nSo this is the biggest challenge for QAnon.\nI mean the entire point of QAnon was the only way we can take on the pedophile cabal is if Donald Trump is elected.\nThat's why the military recruited them they believe and then he loses.\nUm and so January 6th was sort of a lot of people had pinned their hopes on that being the storm.\nUm and then it didn't happen.\nAnd so then they kept thinking, well, maybe all these troops are in DC for the inauguration to arrest Biden.\nAnd that didn't happen.\nAnd and I talked to a QAnon believer uh the day of the inauguration who said, you know, I threw up.\nI was so upset that suddenly as Biden put his hand on the Bible, it became clear to me that this wasn't going to happen.\nUm and so QAnon kind of stumbles along there.\nUh Q comes out and basically says, \"Stop talking about Q.\nKeep talking about the cabal.\nStop talking about Q so much.\"\nEssentially because people have realized that we're lunatics if you talk about Q or where we go on we go all all our slogans.\nUm but keep the ideas going.\nUm and so from there QAnon sort of gets subsumed in a way into the broader Republican party.\nWe can think about Marjorie Taylor Green, who is a hardcore QAnon believer at the time.\nUm I mean I've looked at her post.\nI mean she wasn't someone who just posted Q a couple times.\nUh she was like deep in it.\nAnd so now you know she's one of the most prominent members of the house.\nShe's a huge fundraiser.\nSo a lot of these people they kind of take off the QAnon outfit uh but they still keep thinking in that way.\nSo you mentioned a few minutes ago that during this period 2019 Jeffrey Epstein is found dead in his cell.\nSo in not the background but uh not the foreground compared to Q, there is this other thing happening where there actually is a very rich and powerful person who has been arrested for pedophilia for sex trafficking and then he's found dead mysteriously.\nTell me a bit about the theories that begin to build around that and and how these things converge.\nYeah, I mean I think the most effective conspiracy theories really have a grain a kernel of truth at their center.\nUm or they have something that is genuinely very weird or unprecedented uh or uncomfortable or you know a crime in this case uh and in the case of Jeffrey Epstein even from the start of QAnon or its precursor conspiracy theories like Pizzagate uh Epstein was really a lot of material was was was drawn from him because it was a case of you know someone who was sex trafficking who had powerful connections uh and so they already were very interested in Jeffrey Epstein and then when he was indicted and then later found dead.\nThat I mean that made it just explode because this was a case where people you didn't come off like a crazy person if you said don't you think it's weird what happened to Jeffrey Epstein.\nWhat was he doing?\nHow did he have all these connections to people like Bill Clinton or Donald Trump?\nUm you know and and from there you know then you can kind of recruit people into believing in something more outlandish like QAnon.\nUh, and so really I I would say Epstein's death even before the pandemic was really a huge crossover moment for QAnon in terms of getting new recruits because people really were legitimately unsettled by it.\nSo So David French, my colleague, had this good line where he called the Jeffrey Epstein uh theories the thinking man's QAnon.\nAnd and I get that because the thing about Epstein is that it is weird and there are things in it that are hard to explain and there are things here that really happened, right?\nThis was not a bunch of cryptic delicacings on a on an internet message board.\nSo maybe let's start this section this way.\nIf you were trying to explain the Jeffrey Epstein story, not any conspiracies, just the story to somebody who didn't really know anything about it, how would you do it?\nSure.\nI mean, so there in in let's say the the the early as there's this guy named Jeffrey Epstein who is fabulously wealthy.\nPeople don't know why he's so wealthy really.\nHe is he is just leagues beyond, you know, he he's ostensibly had had some time in finance in Manhattan, but he's like leagues beyond in terms of wealth what you would expect that to be.\nHe has an enormous home in Manhattan.\nHe has a a mansion in in Palm Beach, Florida.\nHe has a ranch out west.\nUh he's he has a private jet.\nHe's really he has an island.\nI mean, that's the you know, it all comes back to the island.\nI mean, he's very very wealthy.\nAnd people people write articles, how is this guy so wealthy?\nWhat's it where does he get all these connections?\nUm, and then in I believe 2005, uh, a a a mother calls the police in Palm Beach and says, \"My teenage daughter said that this man, Jeffrey Epstein, offered her money to give him a massage and he masturbated, uh, and there was this, you know, essentially a sex crime has happened here.\"\nThe police take it very seriously.\nThey start investigating.\nThey find many girls who were given this treatment by Epstein, and they they start wondering, why is this guy so wellconed?\nUh why is he, you know, they're surveilling him at the airport as he takes off on the private jet.\nAnd then when they start actually trying to prosecute him, it seems like he has a lot of friends in high places.\nHe has really high-powered lawyers.\nUm he has people are prosecutors on the case are being\n\n\nKind of shuffled around, moved away. There's a sense of, you know, don't look at this too closely. Um, and then ultimately he signs a plea deal that has been called, you know, the deal of the century that in exchange for pleading guilty to a couple of these cases in Palm Beach, he will, you know, he he eventually ends up on house arrest. Uh, you know, and it's been said that, you know, what they had on him could have put him away for life. Instead, the federal and local authorities agree that, you know, they're just not going to prosecute him anymore beyond that.\n\nSo, there's some other weird dimensions of the plea deal. There's immunity for co-conspirators, right? Um, and there's something that comes up later that I think is very of all the things that always piqued my interest in this. The prosecutor, the local DA or whomever it is, uh, Alex Acosta, is he later becomes Donald Trump's labor secretary.\n\nBut there's a report in the Daily Beast that when he's being vetted for labor secretary, he's asked by Trump officials, \"What's up with this sweetheart deal you gave Epstein?\" And again, this isn't a Daily Beast report, and it's not coming from Acosta himself. It's coming from some unnamed Trump official, but apparently Acosta says, \"Oh, I was told he belongs to intelligence and to back off.\"\n\nAnd if you take that at face value, it adds this other dimension here that somehow he is um an intelligence asset. Somehow he is protected. And not only that, but the government knows about all this, right? But also, weirdly for where this story goes, the Trump administration knows about all this.\n\nSo what did you make of that? Um, so the Jeffrey Epstein intelligence connection is really interesting because it kind of flares up because you might wonder, wait, it ties into a lot of the mystery about him because you say, why is this guy so wealthy? Why does he have all these locations? Uh, why does he have all these really high-powered connections? Why does he seem to sort of move through the world with ease uh, inexplicably? And so people start to wonder, you know, that intelligence remark in the Daily Beast report has really been scrutinized. People start to wonder, is this guy running like a honeypot? Does he blackmail powerful people? Do they, let's say, and this is pure conjecture, do they come to the island and he plies them with underage girls or or adult women? And does he videotape them perhaps and then um use that as blackmail material? And so I mean, and is that how he then got so wealthy? Um, and so that idea then becomes kind of a key part of the Epstein story. The other thing I would say is the intelligence connection is then used to explain, you know, for people who scrutinize this, how he then managed to get off so easily. I mean, was Jeffrey Epstein an intelligence operation that then, you know, in Palm Beach sort of ran off the rails and then they essentially tried to cover it up?\n\nHere's something I've been wondering about the story. So, the Acosta dimension of it. It's not like Acosta disappeared from public view after this. He became labor secretary for Donald Trump in the first term. He ended up having to resign as labor secretary because the Epstein story kept growing and it was becoming a distraction. But he gives a press conference all all this.\n\nAnd obviously if somebody told him Epstein was an intelligence source, it would probably be helpful to Acosta or helpful to the rest of us if he would say, \"Well, here's who told me that.\" But Acosta hasn't, to my knowledge, he doesn't really admit this ever having happened. Maybe it never happened, right? Maybe this initial Daily Beast report, which is all unnamed. I mean, maybe that's a thing that's untrustworthy. But what do you actually substantively make of it? Like what is your hypothesis of what we should think about that comment?\n\nLike Acosta just got named to the board of directors of Newsmax. Like he exists out there in the world. People can ask him questions.\n\nYeah, you know, that is a great question. You would think that in the way that this sort of imploded his career or has haunted him forever, this plea deal, why doesn't he come out and say, you know, well, basically I was told by the head of this intelligence agency to leave it alone and so it's not really my fault. Um, but as you said, he hasn't vanished. Uh, he's certainly not talking about it. I think I mean there are a lot of weird intelligence connections. I mean, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is sort of Epstein's friend and lieutenant, uh, her dad had a ton of intelligence connections and was involved in sort of various intelligence operations. I mean, you know, it I think part of the challenge is and part of why this story is so interesting to people is because unless these secret files come out that may or may not exist, it's really unknowable.\n\nAnother dimension of the Epstein story, you mentioned his wealth is a bit mysterious for what he appeared to be doing. Um, you know, he was sort of maybe a money manager to some degree, maybe offering tax and estate planning advice, but he seems richer than that should have been able to offer him. Uh, but the other thing is he also seems better connected than that should have been able to offer him. Again, one thing that I think is somewhat complicated for this whole the way this theory begins to evolve or the way that the ideas around it begin to evolve is somebody who was very well connected to was Donald Trump and somebody who appeared to have known early on that Epstein liked young women was Donald Trump. Tell me about the Donald Trump Epstein relationship.\n\nYeah, so I mean Donald Trump was friends with Epstein for a long time. I mean there's a video of them. They're kind of on the side of a dance floor and they're sort of whispering to each other. They sort of seem to be saying, you know, she's she's hot, you know, maybe I'll ask her to dance later. Uh, and then there's this quote Trump gave for a profile of Epstein, one of the profiles that's saying, how is this guy, this guy seems to be a billionaire? No one can explain his wealth. Um, then Trump says, you know, many people say Jeffrey Epstein, and I'm paraphrasing here, but people say Jeffrey Epstein likes young women, uh, you know, even maybe even more than me. I mean, very young.\n\nI'm going to give I'm going to give the whole quote here. He says, this is New York magazine in 2002. Trump says, \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with.\" It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it. Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\n\nIt's a little odd.\n\nIt is. I mean it it kind of you think back to you know how people would talk about Harvey Weinstein before Me Too and it's kind of this weird like open secret that people will nod to. But how does I I guess one question I have as this begins to merge all together and Trump the savior of QAnon, the scourge of pedophilic elites, but maybe the only person on record as early as 2002 saying that he knows Jeffrey Epstein has a thing for young women. That doesn't seem like the That doesn't seem like a guy you would put your trust in to be outside of this and your savior from it. That seems like a guy who might be part of this thing, whatever it is.\n\nWell, you know, Ezra, you've got to think about this like QAnon. I mean, this is this makes Trump the perfect guy to take it all down. Um, in in their case, you're right. I mean, it is kind of crazy.\n\nUh, their rationalization is that let's say we look at this video of Trump hanging out with Epstein. Well, perhaps he was going inside, you know, he was looking inside Epstein's operation uh to bring it down from the inside. Uh or you say, well, why would he pick Alex Acosta, the guy involved in this nice plea deal Epstein got? Why would he make him the head of the Labor Department, which has a ton of uh a ton of oversight over human trafficking? Well, Trump was maybe trying to bring attention to the plea deal and to get it overturned by elevating Acosta's profile. That's how they see it.\n\nWe know Trump is subtle if nothing else. He he does things through misdirection and symbolism.\n\nBut I I I want to stand what's strange about Epstein for a couple of minutes. So Epstein is really well-connected. Um, he is friendly not just with Donald Trump. He is friendly with Bill Gates. He's friendly with Bill Clinton. He hosts these dinners for scientists and innovators, right? He has lots of friends who are very, very rich. And so the idea that begins to emerge, as I understand it, is that Epstein is running something like what we now describe as like the Diddy parties, but for the most powerful people in society, right? That he on his island is flying back and forth with the most powerful and most wealthy people in the world for these pedophilic orgies.\n\nAnd that it is in the union of these two things that the cabal like begins to take a shape. That Epstein knew everybody. He knew what they had done. Maybe he's doing it in part for blackmail for intelligence reasons. Maybe just he has the files on them. And so Epstein is a threat to them in the whole cabal and when he begins to get brought down now this whole thing is endangered and the fact that he ends up dead in a cell um reportedly by suicide begins to look to people very fishy, right? Is is that basically the the structure of the theory here?\n\nThat is the crux of it. Uh, the idea that he finally has this federal case in which he could potentially flip or you know maybe all of this evidence will at minimum come out at trial that someone perhaps either he's killed in his cell or someone, which I think is maybe more believable, that someone says, \"Hey Jeffrey, you know, we're going to create the circumstances for you to take things into your own hands,\" uh, that that is the that is sort of the Epstein story summed up.\n\nSo I want to hold on that last bit because again this is where there are things that are weird. Epstein has already tried to kill himself in prison. It has been the the psychologist or the person in charge of mental health author said this guy should not be allowed in a cell by himself. He's a suicide risk. He is left in a cell by himself. There's irregularities around which cameras are on and off and whether or not they're working. Irregularities around whether or not the guards are watching or not watching.\n\nAnd on the one hand, I think that if you don't believe DMVs are run well, you should not believe prisons are run well. I think all evidence we have about prisons is they're run in fact terribly. And on the other hand, for such a high-value prisoner who there's a lot of interest in, it's strange. Like I get why people think it's strange. I think it is strange. You're somebody who studies conspiracy theories, theories that typically I think you don't believe. Where do you fall on this? It's like what do you think here?\n\nYeah, I mean if I can get a little kind of wild and woolly with it. I mean this is one that I I'm quite suspicious of. Uh, you know, I think uh as you said, I mean I'm used to really kind of going through the guts of conspiracy theories um and saying, well, you know, I I think we can chalk that up to sort of human incompetence or just sort of a coincidence. But in this case it's I I think there's a lot of smoke. I mean again, I I don't think we've seen anything that really lay, you know, what you described as sort of like the mainline Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theory, I don't think has been substantiated in a lot of ways, but I think also there is a lot of weirdness and I think we're at risk of discrediting ourselves with the general public if as you know as as media or you know the government or whatever um in terms of people who look into this if you just say, \"Nope, you know, he killed himself, case closed, there's nothing weird here.\"\n\nI think I want to just like to be fair to the other side of this, try to give my best version of how you would explain most of this away and and see what you think of it. So Epstein seems to have been very, very good at ingratiating himself with very rich people, something in between a money manager and a con man, and that he was living sort of beyond his actual means. But at the end of the day when people captured him and and he was put in prison, the Epstein estate was not actually that large. So, it's not like he was sitting on billions of dollars. Um, so maybe you can explain that as con man work. Um, the fact that all these rich people know each other and fly in planes together is is just kind of what their networks look like. And that yes, Epstein was a pedophile and he um working with Maxwell did groom young women and assault them and that he was just kind of doing that himself and there isn't that much evidence. I mean, there's, you know, smoke around Prince Andrew, but we don't really know what was going on there. And maybe this looks really weird and there's not that much there. The weird truth of this is that there's not all that much important order behind it.\n\nThat's the best account I can give in which there's not much there. What do you think of that? I think that's very possible. I mean, I think there are when I look at conspiracy theories, there are often cases where I say, you know, yeah, maybe this guy has weird art you don't like. Maybe he made a couple off-color remarks, but it's very possible that, you know, that that then you're making it a jump to that this guy is, you know, running a child sex dungeon or what have you. Um, that, you know, there's kind of a logical leap there. Um, and I I think it's very possible that, you know, Jeffrey Epstein was a guy with a lot of powerful friends who was incidentally a pedophile and that these powerful people were not involved with that aspect of his life. Um, and maybe he got this sweetheart plea deal because he was just a rich guy in Palm Beach and they wanted to move on with it and sort of cover it up. Or, you know, alternately maybe there there was this this whole intelligence aspect to it. Um, so I I think that that that sort of question about, you know, it could go either way. I think it is why in part there's so much pressure uh for the release of\n\n\nWhatever the government can release.\nTell me about the role that Epstein and the Epstein files begin to play in the broader MAGA movement.\nBecause specifically of the connection to Bill Clinton and, by relation, Hillary Clinton, they become really fixated on this idea that Jeffrey Epstein was like the Democrats' pedophile pimp and that, you know, anyone you personally don't like as a Trump supporter is probably on the Epstein list and that someday this will all come out.\nThe Epstein stuff and the broader feeling of like something is being kept from you is really sort of the most visible and maybe the most potent aspect of the broader kind of Trumpian populism.\nThis idea that there's this group of elites that are doing bad things to you and they're getting away with it.\nSo, they're shipping your jobs overseas.\nThey're bringing in immigrants to depress your wages.\nUm, you know, who knows what they're doing with gender to your children.\nUm, and then at the very top, let's say in the case of JFK, they killed the president.\nUh, they, in the case of Epstein, they did all these terrible things to children and they're doing it with impunity and they think you're too dumb to even know about it or that you don't deserve to know about it.\nAnd so there's that idea that like your intelligence is being insulted that I think really plays on these like Trumpian chords and gets people riled up.\nThis is not random people saying this.\nJD Vance in October 2024, so very close to the election, says we need to release the Epstein files.\nThis is important.\nYeah.\nI mean, Epstein kind of catches on with the broader public and becomes sort of a topic like a cocktail party conversation topic.\nSo, when people like JD Vance go on like these kind of bro comedy podcasts, people I think understandably say, \"Hey, like what's up with Epstein?\nIf you were elected, would you want to get to the bottom of that?\"\nAnd in JD Vance's case, he says, \"Yeah, we got to get this list out there.\"\nSeriously, we need to release the Epstein list.\nThat is an important thing.\nBut do you think he believes there is a list?\nYou know, it's hard to know.\nI mean, JD Vance is kind of a populist, at least posing sort of guy.\nI mean, he's I don't think really that like there are a lot of people in the Trump administration who are saying there was nothing going on with Epstein.\nUh, you know, this is all just for the Rubes.\nI think they did definitely see it as an opportunity to inflame people against Democrats and to give sort of bigger stakes than just we're going to do tariffs, we're going to do tax cuts.\nIf you say like we're going to get justice for against the international pedophile network, I think that reaches people on a different level.\nBut it ends up being a series of somewhat disappointing busts.\nYes.\nIn the case of the Epstein binders debacle.\nI mean, I think that really sums up so much of how the administration has handled this, you know.\nCan you describe what happened there?\nAbsolutely.\nI think this was a couple weeks, months ago now.\nThis was uh late February.\nUm, and so you have a bunch of these kind of right-wing media influencers like a couple rungs below someone who might be on Fox News.\nUh, people who have been maybe conspiracy theorists in the past and now have big YouTube X followings.\nSo they visit the White House uh to meet with administration officials and kind of get celebrated the new administration and Pam Bondi and Cash Patel show up seemingly like to everyone else's surprise in the White House and they say, \"Look, we've got these binders,\" and it says \"phase one of the Epstein files.\"\nYou know, we've all been so excited about the Epstein files and so they give them to these influencers.\nThose folks then go outside, the White House press pool is there and they get these photos where they're like really like gripping and grinning with the evidence of the human trafficking conspiracy theory and then it all turns out to be nearly entirely all public information already.\nSo reportedly Pam Bondi was hoping to kind of butter up these influencers and get some good press for herself, but in the end it becomes really a fiasco both for her and for these figures.\nSo what begins to happen after that?\nBecause then yeah, just tell me the story from there.\nSure.\nSo then there is more and more demand basically particularly from these people who receive the binders because they're saying, \"You know, you kind of made me look like a fool.\"\nUh, so we really need to release the actual Epstein information and so there's more pressure.\nUm, James O'Keefe, the kind of undercover guy, uh, catches Pam Bondi on tape saying, \"Oh my gosh, there are tens of thousands of Epstein videos that no one knows exists.\"\nAnd so there's kind of this drum beat of more demand for Epstein info.\nWhen, and so much when is the client list going to come out?\nWhen are we going to get the names of these pedophiles?\nAnd not just that, but Pam Bondi at some point says she has the client list on her desk or at least that's something that sound, it's I want to be careful here because the White House's argument is that we misinterpreted what she said.\nYes, there's this interesting ambiguity, but she says, or excuse me, she's on Fox News and the anchor says the DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients.\nWill that really happen?\nIt's sitting on my desk right now to review.\nUm, that's been a directive um by President Trump.\nI'm reviewing that.\nI'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files.\nThat's all in the process of being reviewed.\nAnd so that is interpreted as she's the it is the Epstein client list.\nAnd you know, you now they're claiming, \"Oh, that's not what she meant.\"\nThe White House Twitter account, they reposted that video.\nPeople were saying, \"Oh my gosh, she has the client list.\"\nSo they said, you know, effectively, \"Yeah, this is true.\"\nAnd now you start seeing this other weird thing happening.\nSo of everybody in the administration, I think Cash Patel is probably at the cabinet level the most bought into and the most connected to MAGA conspiracy land.\nAnd then he goes on Joe Rogan and gives this sort of crazy interview.\nBut what about the video of from the island?\nOh, that's the Sorry.\nSo you're talking about two different So yeah.\nSo again, we're going to give you everything we can.\nAnd people have to remember, we're not going to revictimize women.\nWe're not going to put that [Â __Â ] back out there.\nIt's not happening because then he wins.\nNot doing it.\nYou want to hate me for it?\nFine.\nAgain, logical play out.\nIf there was a video of some guy or gal committing felonies on an island and I'm in charge, don't you think you'd see it?\nYeah.\nThere starts to be this new angle where Cash Patel and his deputy Dan Bonino, who's another real like right-wing media guy, they then start kind of trying to throw water on Epstein after the Binders incident, where they start saying, um, you know, they do interviews and they say, \"Look, Epstein killed himself.\nUh, and they, as you said, they there are a lot of videos, but I mean it becomes almost this weird twist where they start saying like, \"We're not going to release these sicko videos.\nWhy are you even asking about that effectively?\"\nAnd it's like, well, you were the one who was, you know, who was really hyping up this information and so they start really trying to, I would say, lower expectations about what's going to happen.\nHow well does that work?\nNot very well.\nI mean, people became furious with Cash Patel and Vonino.\nI mean, they were really already facing criticism for a lot of other things.\nYou know, this is an audience that wants, you know, they they want Democrats heads to roll.\nThey think the deep state was out to get Trump for many other reasons and they're not seeing, you know, Hillary Clinton getting arrested or the people who prosecuted Trump getting arrested and so they're already really mad.\nAnd you can see that the pressure in particular is getting to Bonino because he's posting like all the time.\nHe's saying this the deputy FBI director, right?\nLike he should have better things to do, but he's posting, you know, I'm working really hard on, you know, finding out who took cocaine to the White House or or, you know, who planted the pipe bomb at January 6th because they believe that was like a false flag operation.\nSo, this is an administration that you can see is already really beholden to these to satisfying these conspiracy theories.\nThis gets at something that is different about Trump's second administration from his first.\nIn Trump won, his administration was staffed with a lot of members of the Republican or business establishment.\nAnd so there was this layer of separation between Trump and the MAGA types inside the White House and his administration.\nWhen he complained that there was a deep state that was fighting him, it may not have been true in the sense he sometimes meant it, but there was a bureaucracy.\nThere were other factions and coalitions that were not bought into what Maggle was.\nIn his second term, that separation isn't there anymore.\nHe has put the most loyal soldiers he can find in these positions.\nI mean, nobody can say Cash Patel and Dan Benjino are members of the establishment, right?\nThey were not like promoted up through the ranks of the FBI.\nPam Bondi is very much handpicked by Donald Trump.\nLike elsewhere, you have people like RFK Jr.\nAnd so there is this absence that emerges of the ability to use the move Trump used all the time in his first administration, which is you can't blame me.\nI'm at war with these people.\nNow they're his people.\nAnd Trump himself seems to be getting upset that they're not being trusted, that that MAGA is turning on on them and not not trusting him.\nAnd he gives uh this comment uh when asked about it by by the press.\nAre you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?\nThis guy's been talked about for years.\nYou're asking we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things and are people still talking about this guy, this creep that is unbelievable.\nWhat have you made of where Trump is on this and his sudden, you know, sense that it's ridiculous to keep asking about this creep Jeff Epstein?\nIt's I mean, I think Trump is basically just expecting the this movement that he has created, this MAGA movement with a whole lot of conspiracy theorists in it.\nUh, no matter how much I mean, this is a guy who would signal to QAnon and he would say, \"Well, maybe QAnon's right about something.\"\nAnd now he's expecting them to fall into line.\nAnd you know, on one hand, I can see why he would think that because they've fallen in line on so many other things in the past.\nUh but now, but this potentially I think this Epstein thing is so is so powerful to people and and you know, it's something that you really have to swallow.\nI mean, you're going to accept I mean, if they believe that there's a pedophile cabal, you're going to accept that there's Trump's not going to pursue them, not going to get justice.\nThat's a lot to take or you have to accept that they were all lying to you.\nYes.\nAnd and you know, that is the worst case scenario.\nThey're they're going to let the pedophile cabal keep going.\nBest case scenario, they were capitalizing on genuine cases of young girls being, you know, sexually abused that they were they jinned that up and and use it to help win the election.\nThere's another figure in here who seems significant to me, which is Elon Musk.\nTell me a bit about Elon Musk's role in all this.\nYeah, I mean, I think Musk has really helped bring this Epstein situation to a boil just in the past couple months.\nUm, so Elon Musk obviously was was a very close Trump lieutenant and funer uh and very involved with Doge.\nUh, but then after he and Trump had a falling out a few weeks ago, he comes out and says, you know, and this there's kind of this like he's kind of biting Trump.\nThere's, oh, you know, they're spending too much money.\nUltimately, that's not really something magnet people care too much about.\nOh, he's not being enough of a deficit hawk.\nBut then amid this kind of dayong fight, he then comes out, Musk comes out and says, well, you know what?\nYou're not going to get the Epstein files because Trump is in the Epstein files and that's why they're not coming out.\nYeah.\nThis is June 5th.\nHe tweets time to drop the really big bomb at real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files.\nThat is the real reason they have not been made public.\nAnd and that is a big bomb.\nAnd I think that was treated greatly by people in the MAGA movement and these right-wing influencers and everyone else as suddenly the moment that the gloves were off and this is a a rift that cannot be healed.\nUh Musk has since deleted that tweet, although on July 7th he wrote, \"What's the time?\nOh, look, it's no one has been arrested at O''lock.\"\nAgain, I guess there are two ways of understanding Musk here.\nOne is that he knows something that he was inside the government, that his Doge people were sort of everywhere and that he is telling us this thing that he knows that many people have also believed might be true because Trump did have this relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\nAnd the other is that he knows nothing, but he does understand the pressure points of the MAGA base.\nAnd he does understand that Epstein is a high engagement topic.\nAnd he even knows that it can't really be disproven because, you know, how do you rebut the idea there's a secret file connecting Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein?\nWhere are you on this?\nYeah.\nI mean, I I I think if you looked if this was in the other administration and the president's, you know, closest adviser and bankroll comes out and says, you know, this president is in the pedophile files, it would be treated very seriously.\nUm, you know, I I I think that, you know, Musk is a obviously a very smart guy and on one hand perhaps he is recognizing that this is sort of the ultimate insult to pull on Trump and something that will cause Trump a lot of trouble with the base as it has gone on to cause uh or you know you know he did have people all over the government.\nI mean who's to say and you know he himself is is very insinuated or was in Trump circles.\nSo you know it like so many things about Epstein, you know, who's to say it's not true?\nThe other dimension of Musk is that I mean he's owns Twitter or I guess we\n\n\nShould call it X, and he's, I mean, his posts on that get, I mean, he's juiced his own uh centrality to the algorithm.\nSo when he writes something, it gets tens of millions, sometimes even more than that, views.\nSo when he broadcasts this, and he's been recently retweeting people talking about it, right?\nHe's able to go onto one of these central platforms that has been a ground zero for this kind of conspiracy thinking and make the conspiracy more engaging, right?\nLike, tell the algorithm that things that talk about Jeffrey Epstein are things you really want to be showing to people.\nAnd so I feel like there's an interesting dimension of that too, that one of the one of the reasons I think so many MAGA people have gotten into this.\nIt's not that nobody else was interested in Jeffrey Epstein, but until you know something, right?\nThis is how I always felt about it.\nIt's like, I do think there's smoke there.\nI do think it looks weird.\nAnd on the other hand, you know, it's hard to say anything because I don't know anything.\nBut if you're in the engagement business and you don't care about facts, then it's easy to say things.\nIt is, in fact, profitable because people want to hear it.\nThey want to hear the speculation here.\nThere is interest.\nYou will get views.\nYou will get retweets.\nYou will get, you know, people listening to your podcast.\nAnd Musk has just turned X into a kind of clearing house and turned up the dial on this particular controversy.\nAnd then all these people in the administration, they're really addicted to X.\nLike, they're there, and they're in the particular subcultures of it that talk about this.\nAnd so it's not just to me that Musk has been able to make it, has been able to levy the accusation in a way that's a little bit hard to rebut, even though nor has he ever offered any evidence.\nIt's also that he has kind of filled their attentional world with it, which I think if you're not in their attentional world, you probably don't realize how big this is now on right-wing MAGA X.\nYeah, I, I think that's a great way to put it.\nI mean, he controls, you know, one of the main sort of discussion platforms or media distribution outlets in MAGA, and now Twitter, X, is obviously not actually huge in terms of its user base.\nWe know that it really doesn't drive traffic to news articles, but for conservatives, it is hugely popular.\nNow, Elon has shown that he will pull all kinds of different games in terms of what gets incentivized on the platform, and he's literally paying people to drive more engagement.\nSo in that way, I think it encourages people to really kind of whip up these mobs, and what is more controversial or going to get people talking more than Epstein?\nAnd on the other hand, I would say for Trump supporters or allies who want to say, \"Hey guys, you know, I mean, the party line now is get over it, move on,\" that's the kind of thing that doesn't really go well on X, and people are going to say, you know, \"Hey, pipe down,\" or, you know, \"You're being a hypocrite.\"\nUh, and, and, you know, obviously, I think Musk is happy to oversee that.\nOne thing that I found interesting about the MAGA freak out here, you have some pretty loud voices angry about this.\nMarjorie Taylor Green said on X, \"No one believes there's not a client list.\"\nTucker Carlson said, \"I feel like we're at a dangerous point now.\"\nAlex Jones released a video where he says, \"By coming in and becoming part of the cover up, the Trump administration has become part of it.\nYou cannot see it any other way.\"\nI could keep quoting these, but then when I go and watch them or look at them, they're very careful to stay away from Trump himself.\nThey blame Pam Bondi.\nSome people say there's a conspiracy that is even more powerful than Donald Trump.\nThat he is not, in fact, at the top.\nThe elite pedo ring is above him.\nBut there is this, even as Trump of people in the administration had the most direct connection to Jeffrey Epstein.\nLike, you listen to Alex Jones, and he's like trying to like praise the Trump administration and say, \"But this, this makes me want to throw up.\"\nThere's something weird here in the uh, like they're looking, they need somebody to take the fall for this, but the fact that ultimately the buck has to stop with Trump here on some level, you don't really see that many of them saying that.\nThat's right.\nI mean, so much of the power, particularly for these kind of right-wing influencer characters, their power derives from closest to Trump and certainly to Trump not ripping into you in a true social post, which I think is what they're afraid of.\nAnd so they have to, who else can they blame?\nWell, Pam Bondi, I think, has been the main one.\nUm, but even they must know that she wouldn't do this all on her own.\nSo this kind of like twisted logic they have to do.\nYou know, it's the fault of the media for not asking Trump enough Epstein questions so that he knows this is a big deal to us.\nSorry, that's very funny.\nWell, and then you saw when someone did ask it, he goes, \"I don't want to talk about it, you know, let's move on.\"\nAnd so they expect, you know, that suddenly the media, their archenemies, should be, should, should be working hand in hand with them to really get justice.\nI think it is interesting the way this has taken root and and has begun to be at least seen as a genuine problem for the Trump administration.\nAnd I think it gets it the way you cannot attack a coalition using the rules of the other coalition.\nPeople who think the deficit is a real problem and like want sane and sober policy to do something about it, they're already not really on board with Donald Trump.\nPeople who are really going to vote based on what happens with Medicaid, most of them already don't like Donald Trump, or if they're paying enough attention, they don't like Donald Trump.\nThat liberals endlessly want to attack Donald Trump in their own framework of the world.\nHe's a threat to democracy.\nHe says things that are untrue all the time.\nHe's outrageous.\nHe's cruel.\nHe's, you know, destroying due process and and deporting all these people without any kind of evidentiary standard.\nIt's like when you're dealing with a coalition that is conspiratorial, that is anti-system, that is founded on its idea that the ruling class is corrupt and is lying to you and nothing they say can be trusted.\nThat in some ways the thing that is very hard for that coalition to deal with is an attack under its own terms.\nSuddenly its leaders have become the ruling class, and they seem to now be part of the corruption, and they seem to now be part of the cover up, and now they can't be trusted, and there's a bit of the dog that caught the car in all of this.\nYeah.\nI mean, they are stuck in the world they created or the under the terms of governance that they created.\nI mean, they said, \"We're going to get these files.\nThere is an Epstein client list,\" or, you know, perhaps she said, \"It's on my desk, Pam Bondi,\" and this is a, and they've also, I will say, taught their audience to really reflexively distrust people in power, whether it's, you know, \"Don't trust what Dr. Fauci says about COVID,\" or, you know, \"Don't trust the government when it comes to your kids's education.\"\nAnd so now they're saying, I mean, really, they, Trump is saying, \"Look, I'm the president, get over it, move on.\nI say it's fine.\"\nAnd, you know, that is something these people are not really used to believing.\nDo you think they will get over it and move on in two weeks and it's fine?\nI think it's going to stick around longer than that.\nI mean, I think Trump has sent enough messages and, you know, where it's reported that he was, you know, making personal calls to some of these kind of right-wing thought leaders to say, uh, \"Hey, cut it out.\"\nOr, you know, to someone like Charlie Kirk, \"Why did you appear, you know, with Steve Bannon and really kind of lambast my administration?\"\nAnd suddenly Charlie Kirk says, \"I'm not talking about it anymore.\"\nSo, in that way, I, incredible journalistic ethics over there.\nYes.\nYou know, I'm a real, a real profile and courage.\nSo, so now you know you have the situation where I think a lot of these, the really vocal people, the people who are getting invites to the White House, might are probably going to chill out on it or potentially risk, you know, their careers.\nOn the other hand, I think this is going to be harder to square uh for number one, people kind of in the Joe Rogan world who brought a lot of people to Trump and who have their own kind of credibility outside of Trump.\nAnd then for the average Trump voter, I think, you know, they're, they're just kind of upset about it.\nAnd this is a hard thing to say because of my devotion to Donald Trump, I'm going to bury my concerns about the pedophile cabal.\nThere's also a dimension here where the Democrats clearly smell blood.\nSo John Ov had this viral clip, the senator from Georgia.\nDid anyone really think the sexual predator president who used to party with Jeffrey Epstein was going to release the Epstein files?\nBut you see, you see beyond him, Democrats in Congress like calling for the release of the Epstein files.\nAnd, and I think Democrats now see this as a as a sort of free way to crack up the MAGA coalition because whatever the Epstein files are, either they are not satisfying or the Trump administration feels they can't release them, right?\nIf they, if the Trump administration had a thing it could release, by now they would have.\nSo now they're in a bind.\nAnd yes, maybe the MAGA tries to back off on this, but you can always tell when the opposition smells blood, and and clearly on this, the Democrats smell blood.\nLike I would not be surprised to begin seeing ads on this.\nI would not be surprised to see this in midterm campaigns that as a thing that can be frustrating for the other side.\nThey, they seem to have fastened on this as a as a line of attack that works under the terms of the Trump administration uh as opposed to only under the terms of the Democratic coalition.\nYeah.\nI mean, I think it's a great wedge issue potentially.\nI mean, you can see that it's, it's an issue that kind of depresses Trump supporters that they, they're left sort of defending something they don't really like, you know, in the way that Democrats have been forced to defend institutions that are imperfect.\nAnd now Trump supporters, I think, will find themselves uh facing, \"Look, we just have to move on because the president said so.\"\nI mean, I don't think that's really a winning issue.\nThere's also this way in which it gets to something bigger to me, so I'd mentioned a minute ago this piece by my colleague David French where he says that the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy was sort of the thinking man's QAnon, and he had this other good line in there said, \"MAGA influencers are constantly deceiving themselves, one another, and the right-wing public.\nIt's an ecosystem that operates in a constant state of crisis and grievance.\"\nAnd MAGA supporters are so convinced that the worst possible stories are real that they'll turn on anyone not named Donald Trump who dares to tell them the truth or who deviates in the slightest bit from the stories they tell themselves.\nAnd I think that first part of it is particularly really true.\nThe macro world really does rely on fooling its own people constantly.\nAnd it's a thing that has always struck me about Trump and the people around him that they treat their followers with a lot of disrespect.\nThey're constantly just kind of pulling the wool over their eyes, telling them, telling them there are no Medicaid cuts in a bill that is full of Medicaid cuts, right?\nTo me, that's a very uh consequential way to lie to people who are depending on you.\nUm, saying he's going to end all these wars that he can't do lessly and in fact does not have an intention of ending.\nAnd, and, and you just see this, I don't know, I, I think scams are always about something else, and the idea that MAGA has been selling its own people kind of a bill of goods and it is no intention to deliver, maybe it can't even deliver, like that feels very, that feels very real, and it's, you know, to the extent Epstein makes it legible, it's interesting, but it, it, it exists across the entire operation of this administration and of this movement.\nI, in a way, I think because there is sort of this what you might call like a reality distortion field that I think a lot of MAGA voters exist in, where suddenly, um, you know, Donald Trump will turn on someone or he'll turn on a policy idea, and you're supposed to hate what you loved yesterday.\nI think Epstein is unique because it is so emotionally powerful to people and because they have trained, I mean, it's not like some industrial policy or something that they can say, \"Oh, well, who cares?\"\nIt is something that I think a lot of people have put it kind of a core of their beings, and and this idea that, like, \"We're going to get justice for this,\" and that's what being a Trump supporter is about, and then suddenly Trump says in a very disrespectful way, \"Get over it.\"\nI mean, he, he was mad.\nAnd, you know, and and then saying that Obama made the files, things that like really don't hold up to any amount of scrutiny.\nI think this idea that people are having their intelligence disrespected is very powerful.\nAnd I and I think it's something that once they say, \"Well, what, what did Trump lie to me about or fail to deliver there?\"\nWell, you know, what else am I discontent about that he did?\nAnd then always our final question, what are three books you'd recommend to the audience?\nSure.\nSo, uh, first, uh, Sam Tannonous's new biography of William F. Buckley.\nIt's big, uh, but it's, it's, it's worth it so far from as far as I've gotten.\nYou know, I think it's always interesting to look at these books, um, about, you know, politics and ways that even just a few decades ago, how different American politics was.\nYou know, I think we would also think of, you know, Rick Pearlstein's Nixon Land series, stuff like that.\nUm, my second book uh would be James Elroyy's American Tabloid, a novel about uh the Kennedy assassination.\nIf you've enjoyed, you know, thinking, putting yourself in kind of conspiratorial mindset, uh, and obviously JFK is in the news with the release of these files, I mean, this book really cannot be beat.\nOne of my favorites, and it gets at kind of like the dark heart of America, which is, you know, sometimes a place that's fun to visit.\nUm, and then finally, I would say Lucy Sante's uh book, Low Life, about the history of organized crime and kind of skezy characters in New York over the centuries is always a good one to visit and, you know, again, kind of takes you back.\nWill Summer, thank you very much.\n\n\nThanks for having me.\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
