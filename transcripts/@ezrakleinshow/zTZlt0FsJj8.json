  "cleanText": "I've had a meditation practice for about 15 years now, and I got into it thinking it would calm me down. I've got a little bit of a highly tuned nervous system, and it has done that. But over time and in the periods when the practice is a bit deeper, when I have a little bit more grit under its tires, the thing it really seems to do is alienate me from my own mind.\n\n[Music]\n\nI watch what is playing on the projector of my psyche, and I think, why? Why did I, or something in here, some part of me, load up that particular film? And at least in the way my mind works, load it up again and again and again and again. And there are people who have been thinking about and exploring this strange way the mind actually works for a very long time. One of them, whose work I've long been interested in, is Mark Epstein.\n\n>> Have you ever heard of Mark Epstein?\n>> Is he an artist?\n>> Epstein is a psychotherapist. He's had a private practice in New York for many decades.\n>> But he's also an eminent Buddhist philosopher and author.\n>> His first big book years ago was called *Thoughts Without a Thinker*.\n>> Remember, everybody was reading that when I first moved to New York.\n>> Now, a lot of people go to therapy. The fact that it has all these dimensions of mindfulness and awareness in it, it seems normal and natural, but some people built that bridge, and Epstein was one of them. His most recent book is called *The Zen of Therapy*. And I've just had this thought for a while. It would just be interesting to ask him, after his decades of therapeutic practice, his decades of intense meditation, what he's learned about the mind. How does he think about how the mind works? What is the relationship you have to your own thoughts when you realize you're not the one controlling them?\n\n[Music]\n\n>> Mark Epstein, welcome to the show.\n>> What a pleasure.\n>> So tell me, after all these years, what do you think a thought is?\n>> My meditation teacher, Joseph Goldstein, I was on a retreat with him last year. He said, \"A thought is just a little something more than nothing.\" So, I really liked that. I thought, \"Oh, that's coming out of 60 years of his meditation experience.\" So, I've been repeating that to myself: a little more than nothing.\n>> Your first book had one of my favorite titles for a book, *Thoughts Without a Thinker*.\n>> Yeah. And I think that's the part of this that I want to get at, that strange sense that they just happen.\n>> Happen. Yeah.\n>> Why do they happen?\nThe person is in a predicament, in that they find themselves in a body with a mind, having to make sense out of being in the world, and conscious, internal, subjective thought seems to come along with that realization. So thoughts are, in some way, what we would call the ego trying to figure out, \"Oh my god, what do I do in this predicament?\" You know, the ego mediates between inner and outer and between lower and higher, you know, that's the function of the ego, and thoughts, in this way of thinking, would be like an extension of the ego, you know, a tool of the ego.\n>> See, I would prefer it, I think, if they felt like a tool well used. The thing that I find very, very alienating when my meditation practice is a bit deeper and I'm a bit more aware is the recognition that I'm constantly thinking about things that, if I really were trying to figure out how to live in this world in a productive way, I would not be thinking about all the time. The tendency of thoughts to get stuck, for them to attract to negative imaginings of the future. It's very strange when you begin being attentive to not just that they're arising, but that there's certain patterns that you would not choose, and you're not sure then who chose them or how they're being chosen, and it doesn't feel like you have a lot of control over that process. It can be a mistake from the Buddhist point of view to see thoughts always as the problem. A lot of people who get interested in meditation start to value the empty mind, the mind with no thought, as if that's some kind of great achievement. One of the first Buddhist texts that I ever read that made a big impression on me when I was still in college talked about the untrained mind as being the problem. You know, that a disciplined mind, they said, was the road to nirvana, the road to enlightenment. You know, the point of spiritual practice, of meditation, of psychotherapy isn't to make you more stupid. It's to make you more aware or more conscious so that you actually have choices about the way you live your life.\n>> You started that answer by saying that it can be a common—I don't think you use the word mistake, but I understood you saying mistake—\n>> to fetishize the empty mind.\n>> Why?\n>> Well, there's something very appealing about stumbling into an experience of, \"Oh, the mind is something more than just the thinker of thoughts.\" You know, it's actually very peaceful to have that experience of the empty mind. And we're all looking for something, you know, something different than what our everyday experience is. So, it's easy to get attached to what feels like a transcendental, you know, a brief transcendental experience, or a drug experience, and then to go chasing that, you know. So it's not about getting rid of thoughts or devaluing thoughts. It's about cultivating thoughts, you know, that are useful. I had a, one of my most profound experiences on a silent meditation retreat was about five days into the retreat. My mind was analyzing what the food was going to be for breakfast. And it was like, okay, the food is fine. I mean, it's like yogurt and oatmeal and peanuts and raisins, but where's the bread? You know, what we really need is a piece of toast? And that was like what was preoccupying me. And on about the fifth day, bread appeared. And I put it in the toaster and made a plate with butter and jam and sat down and took my first mindful bite, you know, very focused, no thinking, just the taste of the toast, you know, so delicious. And then my mind wandered, and the next thing I knew, I looked down and I was like, \"Who ate my toast?\" It was, it had disappeared. And where my mind went immediately was, \"Who did this to me?\" You know, searching for someone to blame. And I think that's the kind of insight actually that precipitates out of a deep meditation experience, where we see that so much of our mental activity is trying to protect ourselves or trying to find someone to blame for whatever it is that happens that we're uncomfortable with. So much of thinking is from a self-centered place like that. And with enough meditation practice, we start to wade through a lot of that crap.\n>> So, in a way, the genesis of this podcast is I was in a used bookstore in the East Village, and I came across that original *Thoughts Without a Thinker* book, and I'd always meant to read it, and then when I did read it, that came out what, in the '80s?\n>> '95.\n>> '95. Okay.\n>> It's very Freudian.\n>> Yeah. And so I want to start bringing in the other side of your work here. I think now a lot of us look at Freudian work, Freudian theory, and think, \"Man, it is strange people got excited about that.\"\n>> Mhm.\n>> But Freud is a big influence on that first book. What do you still find valuable about the way Freud understood, or what he did for psychotherapy or understandings of the subconscious? And what do you look at with a bit of, uh, well, we all got carried away?\n>> Well, I don't think we all got carried away, but a whole generation got carried away. Freud's been a big influence on all of my books. The whole way we think about the mind, about the self, the unconscious, the instincts, that's all Freud. Freud, you know, the 20th century, 21st century conception of the mind, whether we agree with everything that Freud said about sexuality and whatnot, but it's all Freud. Freud, in a way, was a meditator. You know, he was snorting cocaine and using that heightened awareness to observe his own dreams, his own mind.\n>> Wait, I'm sorry. Really?\n>> You know all this?\n>> I do not know all this.\n>> My Freudian knowledge is thin. Oh, Freud, there's a rich, a rich, uh—\n>> So, so what you're proposing here is that the correct way to understand the mind is to take a bunch of cocaine and then observe. I'm not proposing that at all, but many, many people are doing that, and it leads them into meditation. Uh, but no, Freud's whole thing at the beginning of his career, after he was studying fish, uh, he got into cocaine. Uh, he—\n>> A classic progression.\n>> It can come out of many different directions. Um, and his book, which was written around 1900 or published around 1900, *The Interpretation of Dreams*, you know, he engaged in one of the first self-analyses and, uh, you know, began to really chart his dreams, examine his dreams, and interpret his dreams. And his whole method of free association and evenly suspended attention, which was the purpose of which was to get the rational mind, the thinking mind, the judging mind out of the way so that you could go deeper into your own personal experience. That led him into the discovery of what he called the unconscious. And the unconscious is where all our secrets are stored, and where the aspects of ourselves that come up in our dreams, you know, and in our fantasies, where, where like, what is that, and where is that coming from? Freud called it the unconscious. And then he proceeded to develop a method of probing the unconscious through psychotherapy, which was a revolution. Um, he promised too much, you know, the same way that psychedelics are currently promising too much, or Prozac promised too much, or meditation promises too much, because people want something that will cure everything, and psychoanalysis couldn't do that.\nWhen I read things that are heavily influenced by Freud now, I'll read the stories he's telling, the sort of ideas he is spinning out. You talk in your book about him taking a walk with some friends and just ending up, as they seem a little bit dissatisfied, spinning out a very profound and intense theory about, you know, their relationship to the passage of time.\n>> Yes, absolutely. It's a beautiful little paper called \"On Transience,\" and Freud ends it by saying, \"Is a flower that blooms for only a single night any less beautiful because of the short duration of its life?\"\n>> But what I, when I read that story in your book, and I've read other Freudian stories—\n>> what I think immediately is, well, how does he know? I feel like now there is a tendency to prize forms of knowing that can be validated in some external way.\n>> Oh, totally.\n>> Whereas Freud was, it always seems to be a very insightful storyteller.\n>> Yeah.\n>> But you sort of either bought into the story or you didn't.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Same with meditation.\n>> Tell me about that. Well, there's a big effort now to document the scientific benefits, you know, to prove in the lab that when you're meditating, something is really happening in the brain. And, uh, and I started out in my career working for a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School, Herbert Benson, who did the physiological measurements of transcendental meditators, showing that their blood pressure could be lowered and their heartbeat slowed and their carbon dioxide output diminished, you know. Um, so I understand the value of, \"Oh, this is a real thing.\" You know, science tells us it's a real thing. But my experience of going on my first couple of silent meditation retreats, which, you know, a week or 10 days of not talking, not making eye contact, and just looking at my own internal experience, that's what showed me that meditation was a real thing, you know, experientially. Oh, like, like my mind is capable of more than just my usual thoughts. You know, there's a whole vast both interior and external experience that I have never allowed myself that that is opening up. Science, if it was going to try to document that, might be able to measure my heartbeat in, you know, um, but it couldn't get close to the poetics of the experience. You know,\n>> if science can't find it, how would you describe what it is that science can't find?\n>> Love\n>> in meditation.\n>> Yeah. In meditation, like it, like it, the great revelation that can come out of meditation is, \"Oh, you start to experience yourself as a loving being.\"\n>> Why do you think that is?\n>> I don't know. I think because we are fundamentally loving beings, and, you know, that's our true nature. I've always been a little bit, um, I don't want to say turned off, but the idea that, like, the good nature is underneath.\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, we're just trying to, like, pull off all the crust and the crud and the stories and the—is that what you're getting at? And, and I don't know. I have little kids. Sometimes they're really loving and great. Sometimes they're, you know,\n>> Yeah.\n>> slightly tyrannical.\n>> Totally tyrannical. By the time they're little kids, it's already happening. So it's just when they're a baby that our good nature is there. What is, what is that thing under underneath? And do you, do you actually believe it is underneath, or do you believe it is a thing we are shaping, and then it feels like it was always there in sufficiently advanced meditation or moments of awakening?\nI had a conversation once with Ramdas, who, you know, Richard Albert, blah, blah, uh, who I was very, very blah, blah—\n>> Yeah, Ramdas, a great, um, eventually Hindu-influenced mystic, also a crucial figure in the psychedelic revolution alongside Timothy Leary, one of the most fascinating lives of the 20th century.\n>> started out as a psychology professor at Harvard. Um, I met him when he was already in his Indian Ramdas incarnation, but I was just at Harvard. I was in my early 20s. Um, and then I went to medical school, became a psychiatrist, didn't see him for 20 years. He had a bad stroke, could hardly talk. I went to visit him, and um, he always sort of joked with me. He was like, \"Oh, are you a Buddhist psychiatrist now?\" I was like, \"I guess so.\" He said, uh, and he had trouble making the words because he'd had a stroke, \"Do you see them,\" meaning my patient, \"Do you see them as already free?\" And it like took me up short, you know, like, \"Do I see them as already free?\" But I had to say yes, that\n\n\nThat was like, that's what I had gotten from the meditation side of things, you know. But the mind is capable of something so beyond what we normally think of our minds as doing that the shorthand for that would be love. You know,\n\n>> Are you talking about something we would understand as a mind or something more like what we would understand as like the shards of a soul?\n\n>> Uh, from the Buddhist side, they use the same word to talk about mind and heart.\n\n>> Um, so put that together and I think you get a soul. Um, so what's the, you know, if there's any purpose behind our incarnations as humans, the purpose would be to come in contact with that greater potential of the mind, and that's what all this uh work is about, is uncovering to let it shine through. Well, this gets to a symmetry that you point out between how Freud advised the therapist to show up.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> And how um Buddhist meditation advises a meditator show up, which is with this unusual spirit of non-judgment.\n\n>> Suspend judgment and give impartial attention to everything there is to observe. That's Freud, you know, sounding like a Buddhist teacher. So tell me what is valuable about that orientation.\n\n>> What that mental, emotional, even spiritual state permits is an openness to the other. So when I'm being the therapist, I'm just really curious, you know, and um, really trying to make room for whatever it is that you, if you were my patient, what whatever whatever it is that's happening truthfully for you in this moment, you know, that that's what I'm encouraging, that hopefully there's no hint of judgment. And I, and I think that's something that Freud was very clear about. You know, suspend judgment and give impartial attention to everything there is to observe. That makes space for someone. And it's very unusual that we engage in that kind of way with each other.\n\n>> And how about from the meditative standpoint? I think most people, I'm not fact-checking this, this is an opinion.\n\n>> I think most people who initially get into meditation get into it from a highly judgmental place.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Of their own emotional experience. Very true for me. I would like to not feel the way I am feeling all the time. Anxious, spun up, you know, pulled along by the current of my own thoughts, and I have been told this can help. And sometimes it does. Sometimes it does the opposite and makes you more aware of actually how stirred up you are. And then you start telling this to more experienced meditators and they say, \"Oh, right. Yeah, this was missold to you. This is about being aware of what's going on, not about attaining this much more aquinomous state that that that you were showing up instrumentally to grab hold of.\n\n>> Yeah. It's not just about being aware of what's going on. It's about changing the way you relate to what's going on.\n\n>> Coming into meditation, all I could see was my own judgmental mind. You know, I'm judging myself. I'm judging the other people there. We're not even talking. I'm not even looking at them. I've got an opinion about everything. That's what's occupying my mind. You know, gradually with meditation, just be mindful. See what's there. See, see what you're feeling. See what your mind is doing. Gradually, you see those goto conditioned responses to one's world that doesn't have to be the last word in how you relate, and it doesn't feel good, and that's the main thing. So you start to feel, oh, this doesn't feel good, and there's an alternative. I don't have to be judging, you know.\n\n>> Well, you say that, that's not my experience of it. I often will hear, yeah.\n\n>> Meditation teachers and for that matter, therapists say something like this, right? It is the implication is it how I feel about things, what emerges into my mind is under my control. I understand that I can be less reactive to what I'm thinking or what the feelings are still there. They just feel like they're bouncing around inside of me.\n\n>> Yeah, the feelings are still there. I think that, I think that's the common experience. Um, the wish is that they're just going to go away and you're going to become a different person, but the, the much more common experience is that you just are who you are. The reactions are still there. But as a one-time teacher of mine used to say, at one point they were these big monsters, you know, at an, and the monsters became like little in the mind, you, you know, so you're trying to cultivate equinimity. The Buddha talked about, uh, you know, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, uh, uh, sorrow, and so on, as like the, the, the great winds that blow through us. So it's, uh, uh, trying to get your mind into a place like, uh, uh, on the, on the top of a great mountain or under a big tree, you know, where, uh, all the, all the es and flows, all the fluctuations are, are part of, uh, what the mind can tolerate.\n\nAnd how much is this emerging from the, I don't know how to describe it, the lack of identification with what we normally think of as the self. Um, you have a line, the more you examine your experience, the more mysterious and elusive the self becomes. This is an enriching, if also a sobering and humbling realization. And it's a bit where I started, but, but this feeling that, oh, I might be feeling this way, but I'm not choosing it, and I don't necessarily have to follow it. It's both valuable and it's very strange. It's very self-alienating. You know, 10, 15 years into having a meditation practice, I'm much less certain of why the things happening in my head are happening than I was before when I didn't question them. And I just assumed that what was going on in my head was the outcome of some cohesive process and, and, and self and set of intentions that were, you know, I was thinking about this, and that's what I should be thinking about. Well, I think it's a really nice thing to be less certain. You know, that the, that little bit of freedom that I was talking about before, but that's, that's associated with being a little less certain about everything, certainly about the self, you know, um, in Buddhist psychology, one of the main principles is selflessness, you know. So, it's taken me a long time to, you know, get my head around self, self, selflessness, ego, egolessness. But the thing that's that helped me the most is the principle that in order to understand selflessness, you first have to actually find within yourself, you have to locate within yourself the self that doesn't exist, you know.\n\n>> And that helped you understand it.\n\n>> That helped me understand it. Yeah. Yeah. Because like, like, uh, when, when I looked down at my toast that wasn't there, who, who ate my toast, you know, that was really me upset in, you know, like, no toast. Like, what happened? Who, who can I blame? They say in, in, uh, Buddhist psychology, the best time to find the self that doesn't exist is when someone who you love hurts your feelings. You know, accuses you of doing something that you really didn't do, and this thing in, in, in you seizes up, you know, like, how could you think that about me in, you know, I didn't do that, that, that me or that I, that's why like, we're all, you know, conceited like that, you know. So when those situations happen and you feel really gripped by that sense of of injustice, you know, from the Buddhist point of view, you can turn your mind and look at that feeling, and there's the self. There's the self that doesn't exist. You know, that feeling of me is just a little bit more than nothing. As Joseph said at, when in the beginning of our conversation, it's just a feeling that under the power of uh self-observation, it starts to break up.\n\nI\n\n>> I'm, I'm married. I've had experiences of feeling, um,\n\n>> upset, uh, with my partner. I've had it with my friends. I've had it with myself, right? I'm constantly pissed off at myself. And if there's ever a time when the self feels strong and stable,\n\n>> Mhm.\n\n>> it is when it is under threat.\n\n>> Yeah. I don't know how stable it feels. And when the, the self feels strong and indignant and, and\n\n>> so what about the looking inward?\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Opens your patience.\n\nSometimes when I, I, I'm in that mode to listen, the thing that I just hear is like the endless recitation of why I'm right in my own head.\n\n>> Exactly. And I'm not sure it's helpful. It's\n\n>> not helpful,\n\n>> but it's, but it's definitely something I can locate.\n\n>> Yes. Exactly. That's my point. That's my point. So that the self is actually intrinsically relational. So, so the self wants to be in relationship to the other, but that feeling of, you know, she hurt me. Uh, uh, that feeling of righteous indignation pushes you, pushes yourself into an isolated, defensive, rigid, self-important, judgmental place. That is, that's not a happy place. You know, as, as right as you feel about it, it's not a happy place. So, what's the role? What's my role as a therapist? One, to support the feeling, because I'm sure you're, I'm sure you're right. Um, you know, always, and but secondly, your marriage is important, and your relationship is important, and you care about whoever it is.\n\n>> Okay. But what part of this, at what point are you seeing that the self does not exist?\n\n>> I understand the part of your sentence where you located the self.\n\n>> Yeah. I don't understand yet the part of your sentence where you located itself that does not exist.\n\n>> Everything appears more real than it really is.\n\n>> We, we see the world as this is all totally real, you know, but it's not. It's a, it's much more, uh, um, uh, eancent. It's much more impermanent. It's much less stable than we want it to be. You know, like the, the final words of the Diamond Sutra, you know, this is how you should experience this fleeting world. A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, a flash of lightning in a summer cloud, a flickering lamp, a phantom and a dream. So what I'm after when you come in and you're putting yourself in that place of that fixed, certain, hurt, angry place, I'm trying to uh, loosen that up for you. You know, I'm trying to loosen up that identification with being you. You know, the angry you, the hurt you, the judgmental you, the, the, you know, you know, cuz there's this is Freud's contribution. There's so much about you that you don't know.\n\n>> You, you had a line I thought was interesting where you said that traditional therapy unpacks in order to make sense. Meditation asks us to stop making sense so that we can find where happiness truly abides. Therapy examines the accumulated self, the only one that is shaped by all the defenses we've used to get through life. Meditation asks us to divest ourselves of those very defenses. Tell me a bit about that tension. Right. You're sort of setting them up as almost, not, not quite opposite ways of knowing, but one mode is very cerebral and takes the stories very seriously. And the other mode is in some ways trying to get you to loosen your grip.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Be very, very skeptical of the stories your mind tells.\n\n>> Yeah. I was trying to channel David Burn there with the stop making sense. Taking the story, one's own personal story seriously is super important. And there's a real tendency among people who don't have a psychotherrapeutic interest but are coming strictly from the meditative point of view to sort of diminish the importance of everything we've learned from a 100 years of psychotherapy. You know, early childhood experience, emotional pain, uh, even traumatic events, like those, those are all just phenomena to be observed. You know, don't make too big a deal. Uh, um, I think that's a mistake. I, I, I think we need to take ourselves seriously and understand ourselves as best we can and then begin to loosen the attachments that we all have to the various events that have formed us. So from the spiritual side, you know, freedom from identity is, is like the goal, you know, um, and uh, we can see, we can see what happens in the world when people are unable to free themselves from their identity. You know, it's a, it's a big cause of uh, conflict and pain, but those identities are uh, super important to be able to make sense of too. So that's one of the ways that I see these two worlds really helping each other.\n\n>> One experience I've had in therapy, and I've had very, very positive experiences in therapy, and then not very negative ones, but when I tend to exit therapy,\n\n>> it's often because I notice that I, I, I'm, it now feels like it is reinforcing stories I don't want to tell. Mhm.\n\n>> It is a space where I come in, and it feels like there's a pull to say whatever I'm upset about that week, and I leave feeling more upset, but somehow more entrenched in my upsetness, that, that, that there's one part of me, maybe the meditative part of me, I'll, I'll identify it as that, wants nothing more than to loosen the stories I tell about myself,\n\n>> and they're going into this place where I tend to keep telling them, even if only to examine them. Um, over time, it becomes very hard to, to, to say, well, am I getting better, or am I getting worse, or am I getting more concretized in this one narrative? How, and I've definitely, I think, watched people get stuck in therapy,\n\n>> and they're probably there for much too long, and it almost becomes a place of ego, right? Somebody to just listen to you and reflect back at you. How do you think about when therapy, talk therapy is helpful, and when it can become harmful?\n\n>> Well, I'm not sure the length of time that somebody stays in therapy is, is the right measure.\n\n>> Um, because, uh, what, when therapy is good, when one, one thing it can be good for is that it, it's a real relationship. Um, and it can, at its best, be a surprising relationship, you know, that, that continues to, uh, provoke and enliven and, and nourish. So, um, uh, so, so I wouldn't judge it necessarily by the length of time. Um, it's very tempting as a therapist to just sit back and be supportive of the person in their struggle. Um, and I'm sure I fall into that sometimes, but, but I'm also very aware of, uh, um, being provocative in some kind of way. I'm always looking for how to undermine the narrative, you know, and uh, coax somebody into a, a perspective that they might not have had if not for the conversation, um, that, that, that we're having. So, a lot of the patients who have given me any feedback about what they've gotten out of being in therapy with\n\n\nMe, uh,\nthey all tend to say, \"Oh, you always surprised me.\" And that's why I kept coming back, cuz I never I always thought you would, you know, say one thing, but you said another thing. And so, so I like that that feedback makes me feel like, oh, I'm maybe I'm actually doing something helpful, you know?\n\nUh, one thing I wonder about is, and I I'm about to sound like a big skeptic of therapy, and I'm not. I've been in therapy with many different therapists and have gained hugely through those relationships. But we have this society right now that is much more therapeutic than it has been at any other point in history. Much more influenced by therapy. There are more therapists. People go to it more often. It's more destigmatized.\n\nAnd you might think, having spread this treatment so far, that you would see this huge reduction in the things that therapy most obviously treats: depression, anxiety, other kinds of disorders you might find in the DSM manual. And we seem to not be seeing that. We seem to be seeing a more therapeutically informed society where um where this has almost become more of people's self-definition, particularly among young people, where sometimes it feels like anxiety is almost an identity. How do you think about that tension? I mean, you know from your own work that therapy can do great good, and yet somehow we have a much larger societal dose of therapy in a much more comfortable time to be a human being than 100 years ago in this country, and we don't seem to be doing great.\n\n>> Yeah. I I I think that there's a lot of truth in what you're saying. Um, we had a series of conferences a couple of decades ago about Buddhism and psychoanalysis, bringing, you know, like R.D. Lang and uh Ramdas and uh people like that together. And uh one of the conclusions that came out of those conferences was that um uh one of the things that psychoanalysis or psychotherapy and and Buddhism or meditation, one of the things they really share, are that they're uh two methods that don't work, you know, because what people want from them is, you know, like beyond what either of them can do. So to try to answer your question, neuroscience, science, psychopharmacology, you know, we really don't understand uh the mind or the brain, you know, or any of the major psychiatric disorders, but bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, OCD, you know, even post-traumatic stress, you know, there's a lot of talk about the neurophysiological correlates, and there's a lot of work to be done, but you know, the genetics of it, we don't understand anything, you know. So in terms of treatments, even the drug treatments, you know, are very crude. Then there's a whole class of people since the advent of Prozac and the SSRIs and so on who um are hoping uh that this medication or that medication will free them in some way from thoughts or feelings that have been plaguing them, and sometimes those medicines really help. So I I have an ear for when they might. And what I usually find is that either they're going to help or they do nothing. So it shouldn't be a surprise that people aren't just like magically better. Plus, being a person is really difficult. Having a marriage is difficult. Having children is difficult. Having parents is difficult. Being in this world politically is difficult.\n\nUh, you know, even when the country is at peace, it's difficult, you know. Work is difficult. So, and psychotherapy is like a miracle in our culture that two people could come together in a room with no purpose other than to talk about what's happening, you know, between them or in each of their lives, kind of thing. So there's a kind of comfort in it, which might really be what it's good for, you know, like it's another it's a relationship where you can be yourself. And how many of those do we really have? You know, it's true that it is hard to be a person. And it's also true that we don't understand much about people and and the mind or the brain or these disorders.\n\nAnd it's also true that both therapy and and in a different way, meditation are very alert to stories. And I I guess something I have wondered over the years is to what degree the therapeutic stories we are telling are contagious. That the more we become as a society alert and validating of the experience of anxiety, more people begin to notice their anxiety, noticing it makes you more sensitive to the fact that you're anxious, and and it kind of begins to build from there. I've felt that that has happened to me at times. Or trauma is something we didn't talk about nearly as much 30 years ago as we do today. Now, my grandparents' generation, my great-grandparents' generation, they had far more trauma in their lives. Like when I think about what happened to them, what they escaped from, what they dealt with. And if you talk to them, I mean, and I did when I was younger, they did not describe themselves as traumatized, right? That was not their self-definition. I mean, and some of them had gone through, I mean, I'm Jewish. I had gone through terrible things. And today, trauma is omnipresent. You've written a whole book on trauma. I mean, you you describe in your book on this, trauma as a kind of omnipresent feature of everyday life.\n\n>> How do you think about that? The sort of rise of people believing their trauma is definitional to them, despite the fact that I don't think one could really defend the proposition that people who grew up in the '90s and 2000s or the '80s and the '90s are net net going through more things we would objectively describe as traumatic than the people who grew up in the '30s, the '40s, the '20s?\n\n>> Well, I think, first of all, the pendulum has swung about trauma, like you're saying. So, coming out of World War I, even coming out of World War II, the norm was not to talk about it, you know. So the men who came back from war and from the trenches or from the planes or whatever, the norm was not to talk about it. And that worked for some people and didn't work for other people and led to a lot of alcoholism and secrets and uh, you know, acting out in ways that people didn't understand and so on. And the therapeutic culture that we're a part of came around and began to see what the downside was of that way of coping. The intrinsic tendency of the ego, of the self, the intrinsic defense mechanism is to look away. And that's when the when the Buddha used the word *dooka* to describe, you know, suffering, life is tinged with a sense of unsatisfactoriness or suffering. Um, the actual word *dooka* can be broken apart and translated as \"hard to face.\" And uh, the problem with that is that we never put words on it. You know, when trauma, either little trauma of, you know, second grade being difficult or uh big trauma of losing a child or a partner or a piece of your body or whatever. My sense of what can be therapeutic in that with in those conditions is to help a person who has been through something like that begin to articulate what the experience really was. And uh, once it's articulated, it can either become, you know, a thing that gets overarticulated, like you were saying, where it becomes the defining narrative, or it can take its place in a person's history so that they have the understanding, they've achieved the understanding, and they can begin to file it away in a conscious way, in a conscious place, rather than it being stored in some kind of unconscious place where it where it leaps out in the shadows, you know, and and wrecks a life. So the overarticulation of the anxiety that one could say is a normal part of being a human, um, is um just as much a problem as the as the suppression or or repression. Um, because once you're overidentified with any aspect of your experience, then you're falling into the trap of conceit or of self, and that becomes a limiting factor. Um, and it it's sort of like it's making me think about, you know, the the swings of the pendulum in terms of uh infants and their and parents and their and the infant sleep. You know, when when we had kids, it was all about Ferber and you had to Ferberize your child and let them cry, and then the pendulum swung and it's like sleep in the same bed, and and uh you, you know, there's problems on either side. Let me ask you or try a thought on you and and see what you think of it. In my in the people I have known who have gone through profoundly terrible things, things people should not have to go through, the people I've known who it seems have emerged the healthiest, um, in some cases, I feel like they're much healthier than I am with my more gentle existence, are the people who have eventually turned the work they were doing inward to work they're doing outward. That something about what they went through and the way they processed it became a way they began to interact with others, and they made meaning out of it. It became part of the way they give their own gifts into the world, and it has deepened their own sensitivity and empathy and the set of tools that they they they use to help others. And then the people I've known who have struggled more, I feel like they've sort of gotten trapped on the internal part, right? It's become not just a story about them, but a story that has kept them trapped inside themselves and uh a way they've sort of it's become a way they don't have to engage as much with other people and other people's experiences because like theirs has remained so overwhelming. There's something about being able to turn the internal experience into something external that that seems important, but my sample size here is\n\n>> No, I think you're totally right. That to me, that seems totally correct. The common tendency when some horrible thing happens that we feel should never happen to anyone, but those kinds of things are going to happen to everyone, um, because we all face old age, illness, death, separation from the loved, etc. But when it happens in an obvious extreme way, the um the common psychological tendency is to feel like I'm the only one who this is happening to. They call it a sense of singularity, and that is very imprisoning. You know, it's totally normal. Like, of course, like you, you know, the floods that are happening now at the in the camp in Texas, you know, that should never be happening. All these all these parents are losing their kids, you know, uh um, and each one is going to feel like, you know, the singularity of that experience. No one is going to be able to relate to this. And they, you know, there are a couple of great Buddhist stories, famous Buddhist stories where the Buddha comes upon a woman whose child has died who won't put down her dead baby, and and everyone, the villagers are scared of her, and and uh she's acting like a crazy person, and she says, \"Isn't there anyone who can help me?\" And they point her towards the Buddha. The Buddha says, \"Yeah, I've got medicine for you. Just all I need is a mustard seed from a family in, you know, anywhere, a family in the village where no one has lost a husband or a wife or a parent or a child. Just go bring me the mustard seed.\" And she goes uh she goes and talks to everyone, and she can't find anyone who hasn't experienced uh this kind of loss. And one of the great benefits of working in a psychotherapeutic way with an event like that is that sometimes you start to feel like even though this horrible thing has happened to me, like this is a window into all the horrible things that are happening everywhere to everyone. I don't have the quote from you in front of me, but but in that book about trauma, you you write something that is like trauma is an experience is a is a terrible experience that is not relationally held.\n\n>> Mhm. Yeah. Well, what what makes it a terrible experience is that it's not relationally held. Like the like the need is for the holding in the aftermath of of something like that, you know. Tell me about the relational dimension of it, though.\n\n>> Well, we're relational beings. That's the that's the great revelation, you know. We think we're we think we're isolated individuals, you know, like locked inside our heads with our thoughts. You, you know, like like uh uh in competition with with everybody else, but we're but we're not. We're from the beginning, from infancy, we're relational beings. We know ourselves through the reflection, the mirroring of the parent. You know, we are constantly in relationship to our world. We're not separate from the world. We are of the world, and we are of each other. So, we need each other, you know, we need each other to make sense out of our experience.\n\n>> The needing each other is it's such an interesting dimension of being human. You know, when um, you know, in the classic sort of origin story of the Buddha, you know, goes out and sees old age, goes out and sees sickness, sees death, sees loss. It's not just it'll happen to you, it will happen to everybody. And it makes being in relationship with anybody very frightening all the way down to the the very the the small bits of it, which is far before you face any of that, just the the the knowledge that the on the one hand that you need people terribly and on the other hand that you won't always get what you want from them.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> Like the nature of other people is they cannot fully give you what you want because they're someone else.\n\n>> Yep. And like there's always going to be that gap between the two of you.\n\n>> Yeah.\n\n>> You have a book about uh desire, uh which is a very important concept in Buddhism. It's sort of all about this. Can you give me a little bit of that that thesis? The book about desire was written to try to defend desire from the Buddhists who uh who kept saying, when they talk about the four noble truths, you know, the first truth is suffering, the second truth is the uh the cause of suffering, and the cause of suffering is desire. And so all these all these uh people who I knew who were Buddhists were running around like like denying their desire, you know, or in a in deep conflict about their about their own desires, especially their erotic desires. Um, so my understanding of the Buddhist teaching was not that he was saying that the cause of suffering was desire, but that the cause of suffering was clinging or craving or ignorance. And the clinging or craving or ignorance had to do with trying to get more from one's desire than desire was able to yield.\n\n\nIs what you were paraphrasing there that that desire, um, often, if not always, leaves a gap, you know, the gap between what's imagined and… and Freud wrote about this very beautifully, the gap between what's imagined, what's desired, and what's actually possible. And Freud called that the reality principle, you know, uh, that the pleasure principle runs into the reality principle, um, and the Buddha talked about the same thing.\n\n>> You have in the book about desire this quote that I found very moving.\n>> Love is a revelation of the other person's freedom.\n>> Tell me what that means to you.\n>> That's the best quote in the book. Um, the the wish, the inclination of erotic desire is to fully possess, um, or become one with the loved object, person, body, however you want to say it. The revelation is that the other person's subjectivity can never be totally known. You know, no matter the the uh desire, no matter the love, there's a separation there which can't be breached. So, and love means you allow that, you know, um, and you actually experience it, you know, as first as a disappointment, um, and then as a release.\nTell me what you mean when you say experience it as release. Like, what what does it mean not just have the revelation of the other person's freedom, but actually to respect another person's freedom? Love that allows the other person's freedom means that you can let them go away with the faith and the understanding that they will return. So that that permission and that faith is part of is an essential part of love.\nYou talk about there always being a residual of loneliness in in all relationships, and you say in the revelation of another person's freedom is a window into a state of non-clinging.\n>> You go on, while desire yearns for completion and seeks it most commonly in love, it can find the freedom it is looking for only by not clinging.\n>> What does that mean?\nUm, that the space between the liminal space, this the space of disappointment, the space where where you're thrown back on yourself is a um, a spiritual place, and uh, it's a very important place to explore, and it takes you deep into the self in a um, unscripted and uh, potentially nourishing way. And I, in the in that book, I quoted the poet Anne Carson, who has a beautiful book called *Eros the Bittersweet*, where she quotes Sappho, and she she's a scholar of ancient Greek. Um, but she says the Greek word for bittersweet, you know, is actually sweet bitter, that it's turned around in English. The sweetness comes first, but then because there's always like a little bit of a letdown, you know, that there's where the bitterness is. And the the Buddha uh, in his teachings was actually saying that gap, you know, is interesting. And that if instead of turning away or getting angry or getting frustrated or trying to squeeze more out of the object of desire, if instead we can settle our minds into that gap with less judgment, you know, that there's an important lesson there that will help us uh, with old age, illness, death, and any other tragedies that are going to befall us.\nYou, you have a lovely, I think it comes from the teacher Stephen Bachelor in that book, but he talks about this difference between holding uh, a coin in a clenched fist and holding it with an open palm.\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I found that to be a very resonant visual for me. But but how do you understand that that difference? Because nobody's saying, you're not saying that people can or should get rid of desire or that the suffering will go away or any of it really, but that there's some difference between clenching around things and still holding them, but but being there, being some space around it.\n>> What creates a space?\n>> For me, one of the prime motivations of desire is the the need of the self to uh, come in contact with its own mutability, you know. So it's the it's the need of the self to to to merge temporarily with the other to loosen its boundaries. So the clenching that can come with desire is basically holding on too tight to, we we say in psychoanalytic uh, language, the the object of our desire, you know, even though it's a person, not an object, which tends to uh, alienate the other or push them away or actually get in the way of the experience of the other. The the open hand, holding, holding the other with an open hand allows space uh, around both of you, you know, so that there's room for the inevitable moving away. Pull out of the metaphor of the holding, right? Like, let's literalize that. We all have things that that we want, we desire, and then when they don't happen or they happen not the way we were hoping they would happen, we get upset, right? I wanted this night to go this way. I wanted this trip to not get canceled. I wanted this promotion to happen, whatever it might be. And I understand the the the clenchist as a kind of anger, right? I wanted this thing and I didn't get it or I didn't get it in the way I wanted to get it, and now I'm upset, and I'm trying to change it or I'm angry at people for it or I'm angry at myself. What is it?\nWhat is the actual experience of being open palmed about it? Because I try sometimes, and I almost feel like what I end up doing is like white knuckling through my own emotional response. It's like I know that I'm trying to be open palm this, going to sit here and and endure it. You know, the this is a good metaphor because we all understand what it means to open and close a fist. But emotionally, internally, what are you talking about? Uh, emotionally, internally. What I'm saying is all of those feelings are going to come, the the frustrated ones that you're talking about, but they don't have to hold you tight, you know, because the spaciousness that comes from opening up the palm is what allows you to move into the new reality.\n>> But how do you do it?\n>> Just by opening the palm.\n>> Okay. But there's no palm in this. We're we're not actually holding things.\n>> The palm is in your mind. Yeah.\n>> My experience of emotions having a hold on me, to get very specific about it,\n>> is I'm upset about something and I can't stop thinking about it,\n>> right? It just plays and replays and replays and replays, and every time I catch myself, I can be like, \"Oh, there's a thought again.\" But it just keeps happening, and it feels like a storm inside me, like energy. And I can let it out, yell at somebody, yell at myself, right? And I don't, I'm actually pretty good at controlling that kind of thing usually, but it's still there. I don't know what it would mean in that moment. Yeah.\n>> To open my palm.\n>> I don't feel like I have control.\n>> I'm not saying that we actually have control over our emotional responses to things. If something is making you angry, you're going to get angry before your thinking mind can can tell you not to. So, um, uh, I think it's it's it's trickier than that. It's that once the difficult emotion is aroused, we don't have to completely indulge it. There's always a moment when self-awareness kicks in. And it's at that moment when the self-awareness kicks in that we have a choice. So you really, you could try visualizing opening your palm. You know, like that that literally, um, you know what some behavioral cognitive behavioral people might have you do is actually try to think those thoughts consciously more rather rather than, \"I can't stop them and they keep coming,\" you know. So you could play with it in v in various ways, but the, and the idea is to begin to play with the reactions, you know, rather than feeling besieged by them. And you might have to try, you know, five different things. But, and is that something that you feel over your life, over your practice, over your therapy? You've gotten much better at, like, how, what is the difference between how Mark Epstein handles an upsetting situation today versus, you know, when you were in college?\n>> Uh, there's not much difference. Um,\n>> all all this work you've done, all this meditation, it's you stay in the same place.\n>> When I'm when I'm upset about something, I'm I'm upset in much the in much the same way. Hopefully it doesn't go on as long. Uh,\n>> so what was all this for then?\n>> Well, something to do.\nCome on. I either either you don't believe the thing you're telling me, or this undermines the book somewhat.\n>> Um, I don't think so. I think it it's all in the attitude that one has towards one's experience.\n>> Well, but that might be the the difference.\n>> That is the difference.\n>> So, what is the difference in the attitude you would have had when you were 20 to the attitude you would have?\n>> Oh, I have much more of a sense of humor about about myself. Um, uh, at least in the immediate aftermath of whatever it is that is uh, has been so upsetting. I mean, I definitely, I'm I definitely get upset about what I get upset about. Um, and the people who are close to me have to have to live with that. There's no…\n>> So you've not become non-reactive. You've not…\n>> No, I don't think that that's a possibility.\n>> So what is a possibility here? What if, if, if you do a lifetime of this work and it goes well, what, what have you achieved at the end of it? Aside from that, it was interesting. And I agree that meditating is interesting.\n>> Yeah. Oh. Oh. What, what have you achieved? Um, peace of mind.\n>> But it doesn't sound like you have peace of mind. It sounds like you're stormy.\n>> No, I have peace of mind. Definitely.\n>> All right. Match those up.\n>> Within within the storminess.\n>> I'm not trying not to be stormy.\n>> So people are dealing with you being stormy. They have to sort of handle that you're you have the temper you always had and the upset you always had.\n>> What part of you has peace of mind during that, or is it just later that you are better at returning to something more aquamous?\n>> Um, well, it's not a part of me that has peace of mind, either I have it or I don't have it. Uh, because there's only one of me, if there is one of me. Um, uh, but I have, I have confidence in the people who are around me that they they know me and can um, uh, not be destroyed by me. Um, so that, so that's very reassuring. So, so I have uh, um, uh, uh, I have permission from the from the environment that uh, uh, that I'm not so bad that I'm going to destroy, you know. So, that's very uh, uh, helpful as as a container. And um, and I know that the um, uh, frustrated, violent, angry, sad reactions are just reactions and not really who I am. Um, so there's always a part of me that's looking at it like, uh, oh, you know, if I were going to write something, what, how would I, how would I portray this, you know?\n>> So the the peace of mind is a subtle deidentification.\n>> Yes. With the experience you're having.\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n>> And that, and what does that do for you?\n>> Uh, it makes me less afraid.\n>> Of what?\n>> Of myself.\n>> And you used to be more afraid of yourself.\n>> Um, uh, I don't know if I was consciously aware of that, but I was anxious.\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And and so that has created a… You do not find those experiences as…\n>> Yeah. It's created a buffer.\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Yeah. Buffer is an interesting word. I, I feel like in the periods of my meditation is going well, which is not always the thing I have, is buffer.\n>> It's very slim, but it's just like a little bit of separation,\n>> and it's very valuable, and it's very hard to maintain,\n>> but it is just like a couple milliseconds between me and my reactions.\nThe thing that comes with that is a kind of humor,\n>> wi-i…\n>> which is very helpful when dealing with oneself, who we tend to take ourselves so seriously. So I think that's the other way to answer your question, like, what, what has changed? I think I have a little more of a sense of humor about myself or about situations as as terrible as they can be.\n>> Doesn't Joseph Goldstein have a line that's something like enlightenment is lightening up? Uh, he might. Yeah.\n>> And I'm not saying that you're enlightened, but you're sort of getting at something like that, which is that there's a a lightening up here.\n>> The I, I think in terms of uh, you know, what does all this really do,\n>> like, like, um, I think that the lightening up is probably as good a way of talking about it as as any. I, um, I had a friend, he's deceased now, a psychotherapist named Jack Angler, who, um, he was already into the meditation stuff, took all the psychological testing, the Rorschach test, projective tests, went to India, uh, gave all those tests to uh, control group, beginning meditators, advanced meditators, and meditation teachers. And what he found was even in the most advanced meditators, there was no dimmonition of internal conflict, there was just a greater willingness to acknowledge the conflict. So he was a little disappointed, you know, like, um, but I think that plays into what I'm saying, you know, like, like, you're still you, no matter what you're doing, you're you're still you, but maybe something, maybe there's a little change. Do you feel that there's a difference in what your mind or your awareness attaches to? And, and here's what I mean by that. Even in my own experience, if I get a a really good night of sleep and my kids are being um, challenging, my ability to look at that challenge with humor or even be with them in it is extremely different than if I got a bad night of sleep. And that is holding what they are doing completely constant. And then there are people I know who are much have much deeper meditative practices and and other kinds of practices than I do. And I'll sometimes be with them, and I'll notice that their mind will incline towards the things they like in a situation in almost the same way mine will incline to the things that dissatisfy me in a situation. And and I wonder sometimes if, like, the the point of of of this path, of this work, is to try to, like, change what is attracting you, right? Change what you're noticing, change what you're fixating on, right? The the beauty of the moment rather than the the the edgginess of it. Do you feel that that is true of… Is that a viable thing to hope for? Is that too much? I liked what you were saying about when you get a good night's sleep, your way of relating…\n\n\nTo the kids is different, because I think what meditation is trying to give us is the equivalent of a good night's sleep.\nIt doesn't guarantee a good night's sleep, but the attitude that you found in yourself, you know, when dealing with the kids, that's how we're training ourselves to be with our own minds in meditation.\nIt's very analogous, and that thing that you're describing of benevolently looking to the good, supporting that, recognizing but not judging too critically what you don't like, all of that is beneficial for the mind.\n\n>> And then always our final question: what are three books you'd recommend to the audience?\n\n>> A new book called John and Paul: A Love Story by Ian Leslie.\nDo you know that book?\n\n>> I've heard of it.\nYeah.\n\n>> About the Beatles, about, \"You think you know the Beatles, but you don't know the Beatles?\"\n\n>> Seemed to me we needed another book about the Beatles.\n\n>> It's so good.\nIt's...\n\n>> I've heard this actually from other Beatles.\n\n>> Not just from a Beatle in terms of the mutability of the self and the creative act and love.\nIt has everything.\nUm, it's fantastic.\nUm, Donald Hall, the poet, essays after 80.\nDonald Hall was a like, like a sort of straighter poet than the beat poets, but of the same time period.\nHe was married for many years to Jane Kenyon, who was younger, and everyone said to her, \"What are you with this old guy?\nHe's going to die.\"\nUh, but then she died, and so he was alone.\nHe stopped writing poetry, but he kept writing essays from his farmhouse in New Hampshire, and the essays are incredible, uh, about having lived a whole life.\nUm, some of them about being 80, and some of them reflecting back to when he was young, and it just gives a sense of someone who has a cohesive life and a wonderful voice.\nTotally inspiring.\nUm, and the third book I would say to recommend is a novel called Chyros (K A I R O S) by Jenny Urpenbeck, who's a German writer.\nSo, it's translated, and it's a wonderful novel about the breakup of Berlin, the wall following in Berlin, and a love story about a 19-year-old girl and a 50-year-old man that is incredibly compelling.\n\n>> Mark Epstein, thank you very much.\n\n>> Thank you, Ezra.\nGreat to be here.\n[Laughter]\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\n[Music]\n",
