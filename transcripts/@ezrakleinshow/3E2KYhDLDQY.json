  "cleanText": "The Democratic primary that just wrapped up in New York was a collision between two very different candidates on almost every level ideologically: outsider versus insider name recognition. But it was also a collision in a way that I think matters for much beyond New York City politics of two very different theories of attention. Andrew Cuomo ran a campaign that is based on a tried and true strategy of buying attention. Zohran Mamdani is a 33-year-old dangerously inexperienced legislator who's passed just three bills. Wants to defund the police. He actually wants to move the homeless into our subway stations. Zohran Mamdani, a risk New York can't afford. Cuomo had this gigantic super PAC with tens of millions of dollars purchasing all the advertising money can buy. And then you had Mamdani who was running a campaign on a very different theory of attention: a theory of viral attention.\n\nSo, what's your take? I should be the mayor. New York is suffering from a crisis and it's called halalflation. Today, we're going to get to the bottom of this. Did you know that Andrew Cuomo gutted the pensions of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers? The name is Mamdani. M A M D A N I. You should learn how to say it. And Cuomo got flattened. He got flattened. It was not close.\n\nThere are things you cannot learn about how to win elections in other places from a off-year June Democratic primary in New York City using right choice voting. But there are things you can learn about how attention works right now. And that's in a large part the subject of this conversation. Now, I'm not a New Yorker, but I want somebody who is a New Yorker, deep roots here, and who really understands political attention. And so I asked my friend Chris Hayes, an MSNBC anchor and the author of a phenomenal book on attention and politics, *The Sirens’ Call*, to join me. As always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com.\n\n[Music]\n\nChris Hayes, welcome back to the show.\n\nIt's great to be back.\n\nSo Zohran Mamdani won the primary.\n\nHe sure did.\n\nYou just wrote a book about political attention and this was one of the most intentionally sort of remarkable and innovative campaigns I've seen.\n\nTotally.\n\nSo I want to hear the *The Sirens’ Call* analysis of the Zohran Mamdani campaign.\n\nSo the first thing I would say about him is, um, he genuinely came from nowhere. Like I live in New York City and spend between 16 and 20 hours a day reading about and thinking about politics. And like I knew there was a Democratic socialist assemblyman named Zohran Mamdani, right? I didn't even know he was running for mayor until he popped up in my Instagram feed or Tik Tok. Right. So, at one level, like just to to level set here, this is someone who had zero attention on him. Mhm. Who went from having zero attention to him to monopolizing attention in the race and I think the way he did it was viral videos.\n\nIt's the first time I've seen a Democratic candidate be totally native to the medium of our time, which is short vertical video in the algorithmic feed. I I want to play one of them here. This is one of the first times he came across my radar, which was this video he did right after the 2024 election.\n\nYeah.\n\nDid you get a chance to vote on Tuesday?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd who did you vote for?\n\nTrump.\n\nAh, the million-dollar question. Trump. Uh, Trump. Hillside Avenue in Queens and Form Road in the Bronx are two areas that saw the biggest shift towards Trump in last week's election. Most of these people are working families. They're working one to two, three jobs, and rent is expensive. Foods are going up. Utility bills are up. And that's your hope to see a little bit more of an affordable life. Absolutely. You know, Gaza, who should I vote? Either side will go ahead send bombs from here to kill my brothers and sisters. You know, we have a mayor's race coming up next year. And if there was a candidate talking about freezing the rent, making buses free, making universal child care a reality, are those things that you'd support? Absolutely. He'd have my vote all day. We need child care that is affordable. Buses should be free. The hike in the metro cards is like totally unaffordable. So, my name is Zohran Mamdani. I'm going to be running for mayor next year.\n\nWow. Yes. Yes, sir. And I'm going to be running on that platform. Thank you. I'm going to vote for you. Your energy is Thank you. Thank you. My energy is getting up to inflation.\n\nWhat struck me about that video when I saw it was you think so many politicians do communication in terms of what they are telling you and a lot of what was fascinating about Mamdani's campaign was he turned the act of listening yes into a form of broadcasting.\n\nIt's I I that's exactly what I found so striking about it. When I first saw the video, I didn't know him until you get at the end where he's like, \"I'm running for mayor.\" I was like, \"Oh.\" And there's two things about it. One is it the whole point is he's listening to people. And two, that is a very recognizable trope of this form of video, right? Like the the guy on the street, like the infamous Hakua girl, right? Is because there's a guy walking around Broadway in Nashville sticking microphones in people's faces. this is an established genre. So he's taking this established genre that has its own kind of like features and is familiar and then he's doing this really innovative thing. I as the politician am not going to speak at you. I'm just going to put mics in people's faces and ask them questions. It's incredibly effective. He is the first politician I have seen be native to the thing that is after what I think we think of as social media.\n\nYeah.\n\nRight. So there are a lot of politicians, Donald Trump is one of them, Bernie Sanders is another, who in a way they they were very dominant on Twitter, on Facebook, on a kind of mostly textbased, high engagement social sharing era of media. And the thing that's come after it with uh Tik Tok, on Instagram, you see it now more on on on X2 is much more algorithmic, right? you can come out of nowhere much easier and very visual vertical video, not primarily text based. Zohran was not dominant as a figure in like text on X. No, it was videos. It was visuals. It was [ __ ] the graphic design in that campaign was beautiful. The colors magazine piece about this. Um, and he's a handsome guy, too. I got to say, I'm just kidding. Great smile. Always in a suit, right? So, highly recognizable outfit. I mean, he was very visual. Like there was an incredibly consistent visual grammar.\n\nTotally.\n\nRight. There were very certain filters on most of his videos and then when he would do more um it like videos about more intense subjects like ice, they would take those videos those filters off.\n\nYes.\n\nOr make a starker one. Right. His I mean his mother is right like an amazing filmmaker. Exactly. Right. the the the visual like his sense of film and visual grammar was very very very strong. The the last time I think I saw something like it would be Howard Dean with Meetup back in, you know, 2004 or Barack Obama with Facebook in 2008, right? Like or Trump on Twitter.\n\nTrump and Twitter. Trump was truly native to what Twitter is. You're right. That's a great point. I'm thinking Democratic candidates candidates, but yes, Donald Trump and Twitter in 2015 and the way that that his performance on Twitter be became the way that people a lot of people came to know him, right, as a as a politician.\n\nOne point I want to make here that I think it's important. and I think we would both agree on is you know with all these discussions there's stuff that's new and there's stuff that's timeless right the guy is very charismatic he is very politically talented that would be true if he was running in the 1950s it would be true you know if he was doing whistle top whistle stop tours like the guy can talk he is a very talented communicator so I I don't want to overstate the degree to which the medium is determinative like you could make short form videos and they wouldn't work as well unless you he's got RZ like he just does.\n\nI think the the thing that's so wild about it though is that there's a perfect pairing between that charisma that way of communicating with the form that he used and then the fact that the algorithmic social media means a thing can blow up and I don't think you can even talk about the Mamdani one without also like what his foil was. Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani were perfect foils for each other. Totally like you could not have scripted it better. And Cuomo had this gigantic super PAC behind him. And there there was this real sense, I mean correctly so from any sort of normal rules of politics that how is Mamdani or anyone else going to climb uphill against the amount of attentional artillery that that super PAC could and would buy.\n\nAnd we know that they were just absolutely dominating the airwaves 24/7 basically. I cannot overstate to people outside the New York viewing area. Okay. How insane the rep the same ad. You know what I saw this ad was? I saw this ad one time. I mean I saw it like 17 times in this one experience cuz I was at a bar.\n\nSame.\n\nAnd they had a TV on. Exact same. There was a moment in the middle of the campaign. Wheel of Fortune was on. 21 times. One of the things that that struck me the whole way through on the Andrew Cuomo campaign was how old its understanding of communication was and and the idea at some point I would watch people talking about Cuomo as a juggernaut. And intentionally in my world, Mamdani was a juggernaut. Cuomo didn't exist. And in fact, I think this and he was hiding from it by the way too, but like he didn't exist. That's another thing we can get to is there because there's the there's the sort of what Mamdani was doing on social media through things he was creating and then there was what he was doing on other media outlets which is also the opposite of Cuomo right so but on the first point to take a step back I mean people really have to understand that for probably I'd say the last 40 years there's this formula for how and I think it's true for both parties but I know Democratic politics better you raise a lot of money and then you spend it on TV buys. That's what a campaign is. Raise a lot of money, spend it on TV buys. And that is how they choose candidates is can you raise the money so that you can do the TV. The SEC and the DC who recruit congressional candidates and senatorial candidates. One of the main things that they are testing is can you raise the money. And what are you doing to raise them with the money? You are buying attention. And you're and what you're doing is buying attention through 30 secondond ads that are going to run on the local news in the 3 weeks before the election.\n\nYes.\n\nThat's the that is 90% of the campaign. I mean, the last 10% is yes, you got to you go to events and you shake hands. I mean, maybe it's 80%. I I'm I'm sort of overstating a little bit, but but but you saw Cuomo just run this play, which was limit media availabilities, only pick your spots, be confident that this enormous carpet bombing is going to happen late down the stretch. And it totally backfired and didn't work. And it backfired a new and I really want to hold on this for a minute because you cannot buy attention now the way you once could. You can only earn it.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I think this goes back to the conversation we had right after the 2024 election because I mean that was also a period for all that Donald Trump really did have a lot of money behind him in that election. Kamala Harris had more.\n\nYeah.\n\nShe raised a ton of money. They spent a ton of money and they absolutely did not dominate attention.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou were almost watching between Cuomo and Mamdani. It's like the an almost pitch perfect version of the old attentional strategy versus a pitch perfect version exactly of the most modern native attentional strategy collide. And I do think the underlying product here matters. Cuomo was just a bad product. He was a scandalridden, high negatives, very widely disliked.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, former governor who had had to resign in disgrace running against this this sort of freshfaced figure. But it it also was a real collision of these strategies in a way that I do think people should watch. Like if I'm the DSC or the triple C, I would start thinking not about who do I think can raise money, but who can raise attention themselves by being out there on all these platforms and actually creating things that are native to the places they're running in, which will be different if you're an Ohio Senate candidate, you know, or a Wisconsin Senate candidate than if you're a, you know, New York City mayor primary candidate. But Wisconsin and Ohio and Missouri and all these places and Kansas, they have their own things that people care about and their own cultures. And they also, just to be clear, how else are people getting information now? I mean, look, above a certain age and among certain demographics, people still sort of like consume the news as the news in whatever form that takes. more and more voters and particularly voters who are in that outer concentric circle of political or news interest that Democrats lost by 15 points in 2024 that Democrats have struggled to win like that you have to win if you're going to win Ohio right if you're going to be those folks like how else are they going to know about you they're not if they're not watching the evening news when you're buying your ad points and they're not watching network news and they're watch not watching linear cable like literally how do they find out about you, they're going to find out about you from from their phones.\n\nMhm.\n\nSo, well, how do you get to them? I mean, you really have to like think through this. Like, how will this person know that I'm running, what my face is, what I look like, what I stand for? Like, how will they know? And if you don't have a theory for that that's other than we well, we bought a bunch of points on TV, you're cooked. You're cooked.\n\nIt's not going to work. We did this show a couple months ago um about attention. It was after the election and that that particular show got very wide uh distribution among Democratic politicians. I'm sure you heard this too. And then so that some of them would would come to talk to me later and then they were they they were trying to do video and they were and I have just thought a lot since then about why their videos are so bad, right? Why? Why? The members of the the Senate Democrats and for that matter the House Democrats, they have a lot of money in their campaign committees.\n\n\nThey have a lot of money for communications. They could hire very, very good people. And it's actually not the case that you can't make an argument about, you know, the big beautiful bill or something go viral. Like, I know you can because I do it. And you know you can cuz you do it. And I just look at what all of their content looks like and I think, does nobody there have a sense of what they like to watch? Because definitely they don't like to watch this, but you could put people in an interesting looking room. You can, like, maybe it actually needs to be the principal who has like the taste, but the absence of taste among people who are, well, you've been to Washington, political communicators, well, but that's weird.\n\nHere's a structural, a structural answer to that question, which I, I, don't hold me to, but here's a hypothesis. Democratic Party politics are really complicated politics of multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multilingual coalitions in a way that in a lot of places Republican politics aren't. Now, Republican politics are coalitional politics, too. You've got opposing interests, and I don't want to like minimize that. All democratic politics in a pluralistic society are coalitional politics, but Democratic politics are particularly fraught. I think, I don't think that's a crazy thing to say. I think often the things that success in Democratic politics selects for is skill at managing these coalitional tensions, which is a really difficult thing to do. Like Hakeem Jeffries is very good at that. Nancy Pelosi is the best at it. No one, and I think including Nancy Pelosi, would be like, I want to listen to a Nancy Pelosi podcast. Like, she's the, Nancy Pelosi is not a great public communicator. He is a legendary all-time great, like, manager of coalitional tension. I think the coalitional politics of Democratic politics often involve select for people who are very skilled at managing these very different, difficult coalitional issues. That is a different skill than public communication to the normies. Okay.\n\nOkay, but let me, let me push on this a little bit. I, I, I, I don't like, I think you're throwing this out there. I think you're right about a Hakeem Jeffries, a Chuck Schumer, right? Absolutely. But you think about a Cory Booker. He's quite skilled. You think about a Chris Murphy. Yeah. Right. There are, there are high level, why can't they do? Yeah, they are. Chris Murphy walks across Connecticut every year. Yeah, he does that too. Cory Booker did the 25-hour filibuster. Um, or not quite filibuster, but, but long speech. Um, there is a dimension where I know they want to communicate. Right. Right. I know they want what they're saying to break through. They are willing to say things. I mean, Chris Murphy has been very, like, out there on the level of alarm he is raising. Yeah. And he's one of my favorite guests on the show about what Donald Trump represents. I like listening to talking their ability to translate this Senate speeches. They're even, they're good podcast guests, right? If you were to rank Senate Democrats on how good they are on a podcast, Murphy and Booker would be high up there. Yeah, definitely. But I, I guess a thing I am saying is that the amount of agit I have heard Democrats express about the lack of a liberal Joe Rogan, whatever it might be, as opposed to understanding attention as not something other people gift to you, right, but something you earn yourself or you look for as a skill in other people. Yeah. Or you have some other kind of filmmaker coach you in. It's just the, the gap is so much wider than it seems like it needs to be at this point. And like watching all these people just get flattened by someone like Mamdani, it really speaks to it. Yeah.\n\nI mean, part of the question here, though, right, is like about, there's a, there's a question about, like, being native to new forms. Like, where I, I do think that, like, for instance, I've, like, it's been really interesting to watch. Here's an example, your colleague Jamal Bouie, who is one of my favorite writers and public intellectuals in America. Love having him on my show. He's basically our age, roughly our cohort. Like, he's gotten super good on TikTok. Yeah. And it's been kind of wild to watch because, like, I, I look at him, like, generationally, we're the same, and he's created a following, and he now, like, he's come to kind of inhabit the forum in this really interesting way to me as I sort of watch this development. I have made a few Tik Tok videos, and like, they're not that good. Yes. And I'm a, I think, I mean, yeah, I've not seen your Tik Tok, but I, I think I'm a pretty skilled public communicator. Like, this is what I do for a living. It's what I've done for a long time. There are these, like, weird, you know, we talked about sort of grammar or like, like, there are these sort of differences of different mediums, formats, visual grammarss at different times that I also think, here's actually a key thing. I think you have to be a consumer to be a producer, and I think this is a huge gap. I really think this is a real problem. I, I think now, if I started to get serious about making Tik Tok videos where I, like, talk to camera, having watched a lot more, I would be better now. And if I practiced, I'd get better. But the sort of like textural sense Mamdani has for the format, I think, is real, is both personally his talent and the people that are working with him, which, by the way, I would love to read a reported piece on that, like, how they did it. But I think that, like, it's, you can't, you can't just, like, read some packet or just jump in from nowhere. But that seems like a thing where you should be looking for certain kinds of talent. Yeah, that I agree with. Right. There's a reality that a lot of people who run for office are news anchors. Yeah. It's not an unbelievable number, but there's a lot of rich people run for office because they could sell fun. And then you would have a lot of people who had experience. I mean, Mike Pence had been a talk radio host. Yep. Right. Uh, Carrie Blake, right, had been a news anchor, right? A lot of these people have experience in front of a camera, and I, I just think you're going to start, if both parties were smart, they would be looking for people who have attentional skill. Yeah.\n\nSo, one thing we saw here is that, yes, Mamdani was trying to make a selection about affordability, about material concerns, but Cuomo won the precincts where the median income was under $50,000. What did you make of the somewhat strange structure of the coalitions? I don't really have a good theory on it yet. I, the, the one piece of election analysis that has stuck out the most to me is this triangle that breaks down precincts by their degree of racial integration. Have you seen this triangle? It's so fascinating. So, basically, it breaks down precincts by how white they are, how black they are, or how other they are. This is by census, so these are not the racial categories that I would use to describe people, but, and basically what it finds is that the precincts that are really basically all black or and the precincts that are all white were Cuomo precincts. And the more mixed a neighborhood was in its racial makeup, the better Mamdani did, which I find to be a fascinating result. Now, that might just be a proxy for, yeah, it might cross-correlate something, um, between the income stuff you're talking about. I mean, I think I understand you. Look, I understand, um, my mom and I were talking about this because she was, my mom, mom was talking about the Bronx, and the Bronx was like a Cuomo burrow, which is sort of ironic because, like, the whole, like, if you go back to the whole, like, opening bid of Mamdani, which is like, I'm here in the Bronx in Form Road in this place that swung. I'm talking to people. I'm going to address your concerns. And then, like, right, he, like, ran up the numbers in the, like, you know, the DSA precincts, but he also made, he also, he couldn't have won unless he made it outside those perimeters. Um, I think, look, I think name recognition is part of it. I think, um, voters, I think the devil, you know, or familiarity matters to voters often on the kind of periphery of an electorate, um, in a Democratic primary, but I don't have, like, a good theory of why it was the case that, like, if it was, there are other patchworks that I could sort of theorize better than those. What do you think?\n\nI, I don't know either. Um, I mean, I think you could come up with a couple of arguments. One is that maybe that's cross-correlating something just that's just informational, right? Right. Those voters were less attached to the discourse, right? Not telling the algorithm they wanted to see a bunch of mommy videos. They sort of know who Andrew Cuomo is. And they're more mobilized by interest groups that used to be more powerful, but that were largely, like, the interest groups largely sign up with Cuomo, the unions, um, and, and have relationships. The establishment democratic, there was NICHA housing, you know, Cuomo did very well where there was, like, intense NICHA housing, um, and that had to do with, like, sort of relationships with the, the groups in NICHA housing. Um, churches, right? Cuomo did a lot of his campaigning among black churches. So you might be seeing something that has to do with almost machine politics and mobilization politics, which Cuomo was leaning on very heavily. There's also a crime and disorder question here, right? So, if you are making, you know, if you're a voter making, like, $35,000 a year, you're living in NICHA housing, you are much more exposed to crime and disorder than, um, you know, a voter in, in, you know, uh, Williamsburg making, you know, $37,000. Yeah. Adams won running against crime and disorder, running up the totals among, you know, working-class voters. So, we, we know that that politics is powerful. I have the sort of view that Mamdani could only have won in a time when crime had actually gone down quite a lot as it has, because if this really was a big crime and disorder election, I think that that would have been a big problem for him, and he wasn't well trusted on those issues. Another is that this is a consistent thing we see in the data with left-wing candidates. So, I think you could just say this is something we've seen happening a lot. I mean, Donald Trump also won voters under $50,000. So that there are different things happening as you move up the the income scale where people are voting much more expressively. Even though Mamdani tried desperately hard to run the most materialist campaign possible, but, but politics is very expressive. There's not, like, a bad thing about it. It's just a reality. And I voted against my material interest in this mayor. So everyone gets to do that. Yeah. As did I. So I think you can cut politicians into these two categories. They're the politicians for whom you can identify a policy that stands for them. Yeah. Immediately build the wall for Donald Trump. Yeah. Right. That is a policy. But it is a metanym for Donald Trump. Medicare for all for Bernie Sanders. The Green New Deal for AOC. Money had like four or five, right? It was freezer rent. It was free buses. It was free daycare. It was publicly owned grocery stores. All these are actual policies and they're worth talking about. But what they are is mimetic. Yeah, totally. So Hillary Clinton running against Bernie Sanders had 70 policies, you know, or some very large number, but none that actually defined her. Kamala Harris, I cannot give you the policy that stands for Kamala Harris. The same is true for Brad Lander and a bunch of the other people in in this campaign. Which is not to say they didn't have them. They had, they had, Bradland Lander had a depth of policy on his campaign website in this mayoral race that I only associate with presidential campaigns. It was so detailed, and a lot of them are great, right? Brad Lander was my choice in the campaign. But I said this, you know, when I wrote this piece about him that there are politicians who communicate about policy, and there are politicians who use policy to communicate. And one problem with a lot of establishment politicians is they communicate about policy. And the people who thrive right now on the attentional networks use policy to communicate. And you can lament that what modern media is doing is flattening policy down to this sort of bumper sticker level of mimetic communication. And I kind of do lament it. But it's also true. Um, like abundance, like, has been a big deal, but it's the word, and then it's like, there's all the stuff behind it, and that's a much more complicated set of conversations, but it cuts through. But if you don't have, like, the mimetic tip of the spear, I mean, there's a question here that I think is interesting in terms of replicability is, like, how much that ability is structurally producible and how much is just like telling someone to dunk a basketball, you know what I mean, like, certain people have talents for things, right? Like, so part of it, I, I do think there is a question here to me about how much it comes down to talent. Like, people have instincts and knacks for this, but you're absolutely correct about this. And I think to go back to that video, like, there is this kind of 1 plus 1 equals 2 thing happening there. He goes up to Fordham Hill in the Bronx area I know well. It's like right by where my mom grew up. In fact, I was just having lunch around there, uh, for Father's Day. Uh, and he asked people, and they're like, \"Groceries cost too much.\" And then at the end, it's like, we're going to try public grocery stores. Now, to be clear, the grocery business runs at margins of like 1 to 3%. It's not private profit that's making the price of groceries more. I'm not convinced that the solution is going to solve the problem, particularly in this case, which I think is sort of the most dubious. But it's also, like, I don't know, worth trying. And it also is an attempt to address people's concerns. I, I've had a lot of conversations with people about publicly owned grocery stores, and I basically understand this modest pilot of, like, five stores that as getting caught trying on something, right? I, I do think this gets to something very real. Are the only policies that can become a medic in this way, these sort of huge sweeping, they have conflict at their heart, they make people not like them at the same time they make people like them. Build the wall, Medicare for all, you know, ongoing rent freeze. Um, can policy be mimetic? Can it be communicative and be good? I don't just mean be good because I'm not\n\n\nA like I think it would be great.\nLike if you can pay for free daycare, terrific, right?\nI think we should have free daycare.\nUm, so I don't want to just create a good bad division here.\nLike all good policy is complicated, and you know, that's not that's not my belief, but there is a way in which to survive.\nMimetic products have to be simple.\nYeah, memes are simple.\nThe thing behind the meme might be complicated and good or bad or whatever, but there is just something for something to get energy.\nI think it has to be like easily rememberable.\nI think it has to be big.\nYep.\nIt has to activate something people care about, and it probably has to be controversial, right?\nMedicare for all dominated.\nPeople forget this now.\nEvery 2020 Democratic primary debate that I remember was like just a lot of Medicare for all debate.\nAnybody who knew anything about what kind of Congress that Democrat was going to be facing, no matter who won the primary, knew we were not going to get Medicare for all.\nFashion Bernie Sanders campaign manager was on my show like earlier this year, um, or maybe late last year, by saying like we would have gotten as close as we could get, but we, he basically, we would have expanded the age range of Medicare, right?\nAnd everybody knew it, right?\nSo, but the reason that it could dominate so much was it was it unleashed controversial energy.\nYep.\nRight.\nThere was a debate.\nWould you abolish all private health insurance?\nWere you willing to raise taxes on middle class Americans to potentially salient because conflict is intentionally salient.\nExactly.\nAnd so, one thing about these very big policies that are somewhat impractical in their nature is that they create that.\nYeah.\nI don't I don't I don't believe that.\nI'm saying that as a sort of like from the POV of the establishment, right?\nA lot of policy is built for compromise.\nYeah.\nRight.\nAre not built for compromise.\nWe actually I think we have a good tangible example in recent history in exactly this context from the mayor that Zohran Mamdani says was the best mayor of his life.\nThat got the New York Times very mad at him for saying so, which was Bill De Blasio's universal prek.\nBill, as a non-neer, Bill De Blasio sure seemed like a perfectly good mayor to me.\nMy kids in 3K.\nI'm a De Blasio.\nLet's talk about Universal PreK for a second.\nUniversal PreK.\nUniversal PreK did have that mimetic energy.\nIt's simple and straightforward.\nLike every kid in the city has to go to kindergarten.\nWe're going to make a pre a new grade below it.\nAnd this is informed by real empirical work that's been done.\nAnd we're going to have a tax structure that funds it and makes it happen.\nIt was it was controversial at the time.\nThere were lots of people who said this was a bad idea.\nYou're going to put local daycarees out of business.\nI mean there was there there was conflictual energy around it and then they delivered it and I sent my kid my first kid to it was year two maybe that it was up and running and I walked into this school that had been leased by the department of education that had formerly I think been a big Catholic school.\nThere were like I this is like one of the biggest preks in the whole city.\nIt's like 20 classes.\nI was like, \"This is the most extraordinary accomplishment I've ever like, I can't believe you guys stood this thing up and that my kids going here for free and comes out every day like so.\"\nLike, so that's an example.\nI just want to give an example of like everything that you said.\nIt was the medic policy.\nIt cut through.\nIt identified Bill De Blasio.\nIt was one of the hugest things.\nThey got into power.\nThey actually did it.\nIt actually worked.\nLike it that is an example of all of those things happening.\nIs mimemetic policy.\nUm, such a good question always like this and then two, does it then create a governing problem?\nBecause look, here's the thing.\nI I I see a lot of people like on on Twitter celebrating um, Mamdani's win, and I think Mamdani's win is exciting, but I've said this before, like the downside for him was not that he loses a primary, like the bad outcome is that he wins and fails at governing, right?\nHe cannot get the tax increases he needs from Albany, he does not control the tax increases he needs for this agenda.\nAnd Kathy Hochul has said no.\nLike we're like she has made a no like raising taxes like this pledge and she's not going to break it.\nSo he's not going to have the money he needs an extended rent freeze.\nI know people do nonprofit housing.\nSame.\nAnd there are people who are ideologically aligned with Mamdani and they do not think this is a good idea.\nYeah.\nI I know exact I know people nonprofit housing and the reason is like over you know you do it for one year.\nOkay fine.\nBut over an extended period of time, you will reduce the incentive to build that housing.\nYou will reduce the incentive to care for that housing.\nHe's like, Mandi will say like, oh, you have these other programs you can apply to for relief if you like all that stuff is complicated and like you just you make a market less like profitable to be in and fewer people will be in it.\nA lot of the things like free daycare you probably just can't pay for, right?\nSo if you set up these expectations and then you don't meet them, is it okay because your supporters know you tried or is it a kind of like a structural thing where you have set yourself up for failure?\nI think it's I mean I think it's the most important question in some ways.\nI mean one thing I would say is I like experimentation and new ideas.\nSo when he was asked about the public groceries, I think it's in the Bullwork podcast and he says like we'll try and if it doesn't work, say love.\nYeah.\nAnd like I love that answer.\nPoliticians never give that answer.\nThey never give that answer.\nLike let's try, you know, the person who really most embodied that spirit is FDR.\nIf you go back and you read about like, you know, the first 100 days and like they're just trying it a lot.\nLike we now think about FDR as this colossus who remade the relationship between the citizen and the federal government, right?\nA lot of that stuff did not work, like fully failed, like a lot of the interventions failed, they did a lot of clunky stuff, like there was a lot of now totally different time, he had these enormous mandate, it was a crisis, but I will say that like I like the idea of experimentation.\nI like the idea the idea of these ideas coming from outside of what like the consensus around sensible policy is, but the test for it is can you deliver?\nMhm.\nOne thing that struck me a lot about Mamdani was his ability to listen, like to sense the zeitgeist, but also to listen to to voters, right?\nThe the relentless focus on affordability, right?\nThat was an act of listening.\nTotally.\nUm, and and then being able to respond to it, and it's been one of my views for a while.\nIt's actually is the introduction of my book.\nUm, that we have moved into an era of politics that is going to be all about affordability, right?\nThat you can see this in the 2024 election, that it had to do with the inflationary crisis um of 2022, 2023, but that that inflation had left an attention to like an affordability crisis that had been building for a very long time in home ownership, in you know, healthcare, etc.\nThat um that was not going to go away.\nAnd so like future politicians were going to have to develop a set of ideas and a way of talking about bringing costs down, not just bringing subsidies up.\nAnd whether Mandani's particular policies will work to do that, he really struck me as a politician native to this era of concerns.\nI mean, think about think about the rent freeze, right?\nHe wasn't saying we're going to give rent rebates through a tax filing where you file a tax and we'll give you $150 back.\nIt was like, \"No, we're just going to cap the cap the price.\"\nYeah.\nThe the concern is whether or not the the from a policy perspective, my concern with Matti, Matti talks a very, very good, I don't just think game, like I think he gets that you need housing supply.\nYeah.\nBut he is his plans are all public housing, which is fine, but that's much harder.\nAnd then when he talks about market rate housing, he sort of like as like I really believe in market rate housing as long as it accords to our sustainability union and affordability needs, right?\nAnd it's like when you need a lot of housing, adding a lot of conditions to that housing is going to both like raise the price.\nAnd so I really think there's a question about whether or not he can deliver affordability if he's not able to increase supply.\nI would feel better about a rent freeze that was paired with an incredible explosion of building.\nRight.\nIf you if what was happening was like we were freezing rents and there were cranes everywhere.\nRight.\nRight.\nOkay fine.\nLike because maybe in 3 years we have a lot of housing coming online.\nRight.\nUm, but if you at this level of supply creation, you freeze around for an extended period of time, you might begin to like constrict supply down the road and create a bigger problem for the future.\nAnd the thing is nobody's got ex there are some levers we could pull on this.\nHousing is a particularly tough one because it takes time to build houses and we make it and and we make it hard to build houses.\nYou could I'm very skeptical that um, Mamdani can make free daycare happen.\nI don't think he's got the money to do it.\nThere's more infrastructure that would need than was needed even for a 3K, but you you could conceptually do free daycare, definitely do it nationally, right?\nUm, there are ways to to approach some of these things, but I think this is what politics economically is going to be about for an extended period.\nI I think one one wrinkle to the housing question, which I think is really important thing to always keep coming back to, and you discuss in your book, you know, one person's price is another person's income, right?\nAnd we saw, I think, in the last week, we start to see in the Case-Shiller housing price index some flattening, maybe even going down, right?\nAfter a period where they've been going up for, you know, the last 5 years.\nThere is a real, genuine material conflict in New York City between renters and homeowners.\nMhm.\nLike it's not false consciousness.\nIt's not a distraction.\nIt's not cultural [ __ ].\nLike if you own a home and most of your wealth is in your home, you want to see that wealth go up.\nIf you are trying to enter the housing market or a renter, rising house prices are bad for you and you will probably and you will not be excited about M.\nD.\nMamdani or anyone coming in saying we're going to build a ton of public housing next to you.\nThat's the other thing that's very difficult about public housing and affordable and affordable housing is that all these homeowners who want their high home prices do not want that down the block from them.\nAnd that and that material fight, you know, which the homeowners have been winning in California have been beating the brains out of the people trying to buy homes and renters for decades now to a degree that's like truly catastrophic.\nI think it's fair to say.\nUm, I do worry that there is no that that the the structural nature of public opinion now is negative in a way that makes even good governance not resonate with people if that makes sense.\nOr or or the structural limitations on governing, one of the two.\nThat it's just very hard because of how many things contribute to a working-class person who lives on form road being like, man, I am squeezed in every direction.\nThere's can can Zohran Mandani unilaterally make it so they don't feel that way?\nIt's hard to say.\nCan they feel that I got a mayor who's trying to make my life better?\nYes.\nSo translating this kind of communication from campaign to governance.\nNot that many people have had to do it, but Obama had to do it.\nAnd I think I would say he failed to do that.\nI think the sense is that he was an amazing, amazing, amazing campaigner.\nAnd then given the the reality of incremental victory.\nYeah.\nHe was never sort of able to narrativize that.\nI think that's true.\nIn a way that could ease the disappointment a lot of people felt.\nAnd I think that's in some ways why the liberalism he represented after him for at least some time had a hard time because he had raised hopes so high for a lot of people.\nAnd then it's like, eh, you know, I mean things did change.\nI I'm a big fan of Barack Obama.\nThe affordable character is a a huge and ongoing achievement.\nBut how do you narrativize the difference between people's hopes for your campaign and what they got?\nDonald Trump is interesting because he comes after Obama.\nHe also makes huge sweeping wild promises on a scale Obama never did.\nRight.\nThey don't build the wall.\nBut Donald Trump has this way of communicating throughout his entire presidency.\nAnd I mean he loses re-election, right?\nSo it doesn't work.\nExactly.\nBut that he is always it's like some a president, but he's not responsible for what happens.\nThe deep state.\nSo there was a narrative that Donald Trump maintained as president that allowed him to explain away the difference between what he attempted and what he achieved.\nAnd now Trump is president again and he has much more control over the the the government.\nSo he's not it's not as much of a deep state narrative this time.\nBut although he has spent the last 24 hours railing against the intelligence apparatus.\nYes.\nExactly.\nLike it's very classic.\nSo yes, because they say that the the the Iranian strikes only set it back by a couple months and he's saying it's false.\nUm, so there's one is like can you use it as a form of power, but then is can you use it if you're not being able to get it done, right?\nCan you narrativize the grimy, gritty just reality of governing um in a way that that maintains like the faith people have in you even as you're not being able to deliver to them what you promised?\nIt's I think I think there's a few things I'd say about that.\nOne, I think mayor is a different is different than president in a lot of ways.\nPartly because it is much more retail and you can get a long way by showing up a lot.\nI mean, Eric Adams actually does this pretty well.\nUm, and you know, I thought the the the there's a club opening.\nWhat's going to be, you know, and this is, you know, this is Chuck Schumer's legendary talent, not as mayor, as senator, but before that, as congressman, there is a little bit of a just trap that is difficult to avoid, which is like it will be more difficult to govern than it is to campaign always.\nAndrew Cuomo's father quite famously said, we, you know, we campaign in poetry and we\n\n\nGovern in pros.\nAnd I think that part of the way, I guess, that you escape that trap is talented political communication.\nI mean, I really do, like, I think you have to do a good job.\nLike, you can't be a total failure as a mayor, right?\nLike the city has to feel like it, feel, there has to feel like there's tangible improvements in people's lives, but that alone won't be enough.\nYou basically need both.\nYou know, I thought the Mamdani video to close out the campaign where he walks the length of Manhattan and he's just like talking to people, dabbing people up, eating a slice of pizza, drinking water, like that, you have to keep doing that, I think, to be an effective mayor.\nAnd I think that does actually allow you to narrativize.\nYeah.\nBecause it's like, I'm out here in the streets and I'm talking to people and I'm hearing what you're saying about what you're trying to do and I'm communicating to you about what we're trying to do.\nThe getting caught trying, I think, is sort of the key part of that.\nLet me go back to the other question that I tucked in there, which is, I think this is something you're seeing with Donald Trump right now, which is he actually has an instinct for how to turn policy that isn't affecting that many people into something that is intentionally salient.\nYeah.\nWhich is to make it a performance.\nYeah.\nHe performs everything, including war, including war, the deportations, the sending people to foreign prisons and having Christy Gnome like pose at them in her, you know, in her flack jacket, that there's a way that he feels to me like, I mean, he's a genuine, intentional innovator.\nSay what you will about Donald Trump.\nYeah.\nAnd that he is trying to make much more of policy into a public performance.\nI mean, there is a reason.\nI mean, Dr. Phil is embedded with the ICE teams.\nDr. Phil is embedded with the ice teams.\nHis cabinet is full of like, you know, people from TV, be they reality TV stars from one period, like Shawn Duffy, all the way over to um, the Secretary of Defense, who's a weekend cable news host.\nSo there, there is this way in which I think Trump has been trying to to sort of square this, like most people will not feel the effect of most of his policies, but what if he can turn those policies into programming?\nYes.\nBut here's the here's the irony, right?\nLike he's at 10 points underwater and like all the stuff's pulling at exactly what you would predict from thermostatic public opinion and from like the use of the bully pulpit.\nI mean, you know, David Shore had a thing the other day about, you know, one of the most consistent counterintuitive findings is that when a president talks about something, its negatives go up.\nYep.\nRight.\nThe sort of negative bully pulpit.\nAnd so now the question to me is, and this is the thing that I think feels very unresolved because of how sui generis Trump is and how sui generis his trajectory has been, is like, does it net out as a positive?\nThe question of attentional domination, he does it better than anyone.\nHe is a genuine innovator and a weird genius for attention at a pathological and feral level that is not replicable.\nBut the constant show, the constant conflict, like his negatives are high, he lost re-election, he stuck around, he won, he almost immediately started to tank in the polls.\nHe's a very polarizing figure.\nIt works at some level.\nThere's some power to it, but like how much does it work still remains unclear to me.\nI think that's right.\nBut what it works to do is set narrative.\nAnd that is its own dimension of power.\nIt is a kind of power that he exerts in a way few presidents do over culture.\nAnd I'd say this is true for Mamdani, right?\nMamdani as a discourse object.\nTrump is a discourse object.\nRight.\nIt's not like Zohran Mamdani is the only person to have recently won a Democratic primary anywhere in the country in Jersey.\nRight.\nJust over Mikey Cheryl.\nYep.\nJust won House member, just won the primary for governor.\nCheryl, I think, is an incredibly impressive politician, a former Navy helicopter pilot, right?\nLike I find her very, very, very charismatic.\nYeah, she's very good.\nMore on the moderate side of things, right?\nThere was not a debate after those wins.\nDoes every Democrat need to reckon with the uh victory of Cheryl in the way that right now there's a discourse of how does every Democrat and possibly every politician, possibly every human being need to reckon with what we just saw in this Democratic primary in New York City?\nThe governor, you know, the former governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, who served two terms in a state that Trump has won every time he's been on the ballot there and left with, I think, 55, 56% approval rating.\nNo one's like, \"We need to find the next Roy Cooper.\"\nLike that guy has, like he was an insanely effective politician in very difficult terrain and has none of these like attentionally salient qualities, right?\nAnd we talked about this last time, which is like high-risisk, high reward, high volatility stuff, like there, there, there are tradeoffs here.\nI, I, I guess this is where the question you were asking a minute ago feels like it bites to me, which is you were saying, does this kind of attentional dominance net out as a positive, right?\nIt can clearly win, it can clearly win primaries.\nIt clearly can help you exert a cultural and narrative force and an ideological force force like above and beyond what you would be able to do, right?\nAOC is not like the only Democrat who has like knocked off another Democrat in a primary.\nShe's not the only Democrat to to win a House seat.\nShe is incredibly salient as a national politician because of her her ability to to drive attention.\nAnd on the other hand, a lot like I recently was talking to a bunch of various people in the the sort of new New Democrats caucus, which is like the the more moderate House Democrats caucus.\nAnd one thing that that struck me just talking to them is a couple of them are very talented communicators, but they're actually what most of them communicate in their bearing, in the way they are, is not flashy, aggressive, ideological projects, right?\nIt's a kind of like this person might coach you a little leaked.\nYeah.\nYou know, and and so these things work and don't work in different places.\nAnd I'm, I don't think we have a good way of answering the question of like when is it valuable to to drive this kind of attention and when is it not?\nSo here's what I would say.\nI think one place where it matters is presidential politics.\nSo I think, I think presidential politics, like there's just no question that it matters at that level and you need someone who is an insanely skilled communicator with an incredible appetite and instinct for attention.\nThe kind of person who wants to go do three-hour podcast interviews.\nYes, I think if you have a person who's not that, you're really in trouble.\nThe other thing that I think is worth considering is the veilance of incumbent verse challenger where I actually think this sort of is interesting to think about.\nI think this kind of attentional dominance works better as a challenger than an incumbent.\nSure.\nFor exactly the reason we're talking about, right?\nSo like we're seeing right now Donald Trump recreate some of the thermostatic public opinion on immigration that he had the first term.\nYeah.\nWhich was part of what drove Democrats to adopting a line on immigration that was to the left of what their previous line had been, partly along the lines of how public opinion had changed in recoiling in horror at what Donald Trump was doing on immigration.\nSo my point being here is that there are more upsides to downsides of the challenger for this high volatility, high-risk, high-reward attentional trade than there are for the incumbent.\nAnd they so they work better for the challenger than they do for the incumbent.\nI also think there's a dimension here where they work, they, this is very, very, very valuable in primaries.\nYeah.\nEverything we were saying a minute ago about policy that that becomes mimemetic is policy that unlocks a lot of attention, usually through controversy, where some people really like it and other people really hate it.\nAnd what you're hoping to do when you unleash that kind of attentional energy, that kind of conflict energy, is that there are more people who really like the thing than than really hate it.\nAnd the trade that you often see some of these candidates make is they are unleashing energy in the primary that might hurt them in the general.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, it is a often made observation about Donald Trump that he seems to underperform in the general.\nHe's incredibly dominant at the primary level.\nBut Trump and then candidates like him who are less talented than him, MAGA candidates tend to underperform in the general, right?\nYou know, I think a lot of people believe, and I'm one of them, that if Republicans had run Marco Rubio in 2016, they would have won by more.\nUm, and I actually think that's true in 2024 also.\nThey run Nikki Haley, if they run probably even Ron DeSantis, they would have won by more.\nLike the conditions were there for that.\nTrump creates a lot of negative attention on him in in general elections.\nNew York is weird in a lot of ways, but one is that the just the expectation is if you have won the Democratic primary, you have won, right?\nThe fact that that is not a complete expectation with Mamdani speaks to the way that there's at least belief that he will generate a counter mobilization against him at a higher rate than like a Bradlander would than uh than some of these other candidates.\nBut it'll probably be okay for him in New York City because again it's so dominated by by Democrats.\nBut this sort of thing where there's this question of how do you stand out in a primary campaign in a non-representative electorate that agrees with you much more than the general electorate will.\nBut then if you've done that then what do you do with these positions you've taken it particularly if you're dealing with a general electorate that that is not all the way to your side.\nSo I, I always think like just to finish this one example is that in Ohio when J.D. Vance ran for Senate, Mike DeWine, who's like an intentionally not very skilled kind of more older school Republican.\nHe was governor.\nHe won his re-election campaign that year by like 20-ish points.\nVance underperformed in the Senate race.\nI mean he won, but it was by six, seven, eight points.\nUm, it was not an amazing performance in part because he had taken very, very MAGA positions.\nNow has it worked out for J.D. Vance?\nYeah.\nBut but not in the sense that J.D. Vance overperforms with general election um audiences.\nLike this is where it's like it's an uncertain trade a lot of the time.\nIt it's a really uncertain trade.\nAnd I think to add one wrinkle here that I think is interesting and and slightly wheezy but worthwhile is that you know New York City has rank choice voting.\nThe rank choice voting allows voters to rank five different candidates.\nThat that created some interesting incentives that are a little different in this race that I actually think worked against part of what you're saying there, which is like being the biggest bombthrower is the most distinguishing.\nBut the way rank choice voting works is you don't want to alienate other people's supporters because you want them to rank you second or third or fourth.\nAnd one of the things I thought was very interesting about how Mandani navigated this and I think huge props here go to Brad Lander um who came in third in the sort of first round of voting was that they there was all these cross endorsements and this sort of coalition building.\nSo it wasn't just bombthrowing, like there's a kind of politics you see particularly in Republican primaries where it's like the rest of these people are sellouts and I'm the truest MAGA, you know, there kind of wasn't that.\nMamdani wasn't running against like the Democratic establishment, he wasn't running against like there wasn't this kind of like you see this amongst the sort of left flank of the Democratic party of like these corporate sellout outs, like they suck.\nThere was not very much of that.\nThere was directed at Cuomo, but but it was a a pretty like he cross-endorsed other candidates as well.\nAnd I think the reason that's salient for the general is that it's yes, it's in a primary, but it's also coalition building.\nYes.\nAnd I think that coalition building actually ends up being extremely important in a general, which by the way, New York City had five straight terms of a Republican mayor.\nLet's not forget.\nYes.\nSo like the idea that like the expectation is that the Democrat wins is like a fairly recent vintage.\nLike Giuliani won twice, Bloomberg was three terms.\nThat was that was, you know, that was 20 years in a row Republican mayor.\nI think some of his people will not like hearing me say this.\nI read Mum Donnie as a left pluralist, not a left populist.\nYeah, I agree.\nWhich is to say that people I think have very, very uh shifty definitions of populism, but in its classic definition, like what actually makes somebody a populist politician is not that they believe in redistribution or believe that the working man is getting screwed a bit.\nIt's that they believe that the system is built around like a a a true people and then the sort of like small um conspiratorial enemies of the people who are keeping everybody else down.\nAnd if you can just break through them and have your villains and destroy your villains, you can sort of hit the the the more utopic politics you're looking for.\nI have seen many like right populists and left populists.\nManny's what struck me often about his affect, which I often thought was a bit of a Tik Tok affect, cuz Tik Tok for, I mean, people forget this, but Tik Tok was like its whole thing and it doesn't really work this way anymore, but for a very long time, they were really pushing it to be a positive platform.\nYeah.\nRight.\nLike they they positioned it algorithmically.\nYes.\nAgainst what was happening on Twitter and and Facebook and and other things at that time.\nManny always seemed much more motivated by his sympathies than his resentments.\nAnd Cuomo felt to me much more motivated by his resentments than his sympathies.\nAnd this also then played into the RCV dynamic you're discussing, which is I think it would be natural to assume that these other more establishment long-erving New York politicians would be likelier to cross-endorse and work with the frontrunner former governor.\nRight.\nRight.\nWho could both in theory give them more because he was likely to be elected for most of the the campaign, but also somebody they would have known better because he's been in New York politics forever.\nAnd to me, this was both like politically meaningful and substantively meaningful because it undercut the central uh argument of Cuomo's candidacy.\nThey all hated, not all, Jessica Ramos endorsed him, but like they largely really, really d\n\n\nI liked him. Like Brad Lander, like really clearly dislikes Cuomo, and so do a lot of them. Like they did not want Cuomo ranked. So it created this interesting space where the dynamics were not what you would have thought in a local insurgent versus Democratic establishment race. And there's there's this validation role that ends up happening from which is like if you're hearing that the guy's this like terrifying, scary figure who's an extremist, but then the other candidates in the field are cross-endorsing with him and appearing with him, it makes it much harder for that to land. And I think to again to Zohran Mamdani's credit, I agree with you that he does not have a kind of like, um, I think it's well said that he's sort of animated by his sympathies as opposed to his resentments. His affect is welcoming and pluralistic and also not like they're out to get me. Like he has, he really just does not portray that at all. Um, which I think can be a real problem for a certain form of kind of left populist politics. Like it's a rigged system, it's all rigged, the fix is in, you know, which again, he got $25 million dropped on his head by super money. Bloomberg wrote a $5 million check like two weeks, like, you know, there there was a little bit of a rigged game against him, but he did not let that, you know, if you look at that again, if you look at that, um, walking the length of Manhattan video, the affect there is welcoming and inclusive at all times. But this is where I don't want to over-Marshall McLuhan everything and say the medium is always a message and everybody is shaped by their mediums, because obviously a lot of people on TikTok are in vertical video who who are not like Zohran Mamdani or don't even uh, follow what I'm talking about. But I believe, I believe this strongly that the rise of populist right and to a lesser extent populist left politics all across the world all at the same time. I believe the single strongest force there was not just immigration, and it wasn't, I mean, you can really look at this in the data. It was not economics, right? I think it was the rise of these central communication platforms of politics being high conflict. Yeah. High engagement, like compressed text. Yeah. Platforms. And I think those platforms, in a way that we do not have incredibly good even language for, are somewhat illiberal in their design. That they are, and by that I mean that they are structured in a way that makes the fundamental temperament of liberalism hard to do. They're they're not well suited for deliberation. They're not well suited for tolerance, right? They're they're not well suited for on the one hand, on the other hand, right? The the things that make deliberative liberal democracy kind of function, those habits of mind, the way you hear one like Barack Obama, Barack Obama is not good at Twitter. He's just not. His Twitter is bad. No, he's terrible. Um, because they're about groups. They're about engagement like within and then against other groups. They're about like drawing these lines very, very carefully. And I think they just create by nature a more populist formative of politics, or at least they create a um, a communicative structure of politics where it is easier for outsider populist politicians to thrive. The thing coming after it, which I don't know if it will hold this way, but this kind of vertical, like when you look at Tik Tok, when you look at Instagram reels, again, it's not that no content is high conflict political content, but most of it just isn't. It's much more like day in the life stuff, it's very highly visual, it's, and you just kind of saw that a little bit in this campaign. I think there was something in the grammar of Mamdani that was so inflected by that era. I mean, he's like our really our first Vine politician. Like, people forget all this, but I think there was something there. His grammar was not Twitter's grammar. Kind of goofy. Kind of like his grammar was Tik Tok's grammar. Yeah, I think that's a really interesting point. I mean, I'm sort of thinking this through. So, I I think I agree that social media has constituted over the last decade is structurally illiberal. I think I agree with that. Relentlessly algorithmically competitive attention markets are going to drive towards the parts of us as ourselves that are the furthest from deliberation. Yes. Right. So like I have a whole chapter in the book about Lincoln Douglas debates and like how different that is. Not that you know, not that that should be the model for everything. The So I agree with that. I think it's I'm sort of thinking through this idea of the visual grammar and kind of like a effect of the vertical video as being less conflict.\n\nPopulist in its nature, which I think is a really interesting idea. I mean, one thought I had, and you just said that about Barack Obama is bad at Twitter, is that it was funny. I watched the whole Zohran Mamdani speech and I was like, it's fine. He's not great at giving a speech. Like Barack Obama was great at giving a speech. That is not his metric. There are great one minute clips in his speeches though. There are great one minute clips in his speeches. But like his speech performance, his his vertical video performance is a 10 of 10. His speech performance was not a 10 of 10 to me. And I think that speaks to something about the nature of that. And I think you're right that like, I guess the the one, here's the one counterpoint I would say. It seems to me like there are ways in which those algorithms over time, and and partly this is, partly this has to do with the weird blackbox of the algorithm, right? Is they do be start to get more and more conflict. Yes. Embracing because the like clapback video and the posting of the comment of someone said something and then you you like respond to the comment and it's up there in a window and the stitching, like stitching became this thing that like really generates conflict. Like here's this like dumb clueless person saying this thing and I I come in and I stitch and talk about how stupid they are. So I do think there is still that incentive, but I think you're you're right that overall the vibes directionally in vertical video right now are more positive than the vibes of say the cesspool that is X. It's also the other thing here, just reality is, it's more capacious. I mean, the fundamental reality of the Twitter text box, I mean, this is a little less true now, but it still is basically true, is that it's a compression mechanism. Yeah. And the move towards uh, languid podcasting where we're just like sitting here vibing for two hours. Um, you know, or longer. Right. I I was amazed, you know, I knew this was out there, but on the abundance for, I went and did some of these podcasts like um, Lex Freeman and others where it's like you really do three to four hours, but even in this like what you can do, like you can put up, you know, six minute videos. I mean, I have videos that go out on TikTok that are 62 minutes. Actually, a lot can be in there. Yeah. It is not that it is compressed compared to the Lincoln Douglas debates, but it is a lot less compressed than what the original Instagram box allowed you. Than what the, you know, dominant for a very long time Twitter box allowed you, than what a Facebook post offered. And then I mean what Mamdani was doing a ton of was podcasting. Yeah. Right. Long and then getting clipped from that. And then it gets clipped. But it does come in the context, you know, of these sort of much longer conversations that create a different vibe between people. You know, I I actually find it very hard to maintain. I find I've had many people into this show because they are such harsh critics of me and I find that they find it very hard to maintain the criticism when you're in a sort of extended social dynamic. Devious of you. Well, it's not, it's actually sometimes a problem. Sometimes I have to like hear them remember you hate, right? Like we're here to talk about this. Um, but these things you you just really see when you do that, like how much mediums shape us all. Yeah. And so it's not that it's all like all vertical video is going to be sunny, but it just is going to be different in ways that I'm not even sure we're quite ready to understand in politics. Yes, I totally go with that. And I also think that like, you know, there's a sort of, you know, this is I'm just sort of spitballing here. So, like the I can hear already in my head the academics who study this being like, \"You're totally wrong.\" But let me just throw this out. Like, we've got the kind of like semi-apocryphal story of the 1960 debate with Nixon and Kennedy and how people listen thought Nixon won and people that watch thought Kennedy went won. And like if you go watch that debate, Nixon just does not look that bad to me. No, I've done this a few times and Nixon looks totally No, the reason I say apocryphal and I'm not even sure it's true. It it's sort of become this kind of mythos about how this works and it's capturing the central sort of McLuhan insight about like how how much the medium structures this was this kind of you know there's a sort of preiterate politics in America when you have very small percentage of voters who can actually read then you have like the beginnings of radio politics and you know people know about the fireside chat. Television is totally transformative to American politics. The first wave of internet politics that lasts for a very long time is written politics. It's the politics of text. I mean, all the stuff that's happening with like blogs when we came up and you know, um, you know, Facebook posts and all this stuff. We are now moving like we're going through this transformation where everything will be video. I mean at least for the foreseeable future, who knows these trends change on a dime. I I think it's interesting to consider what that does, right? Like is the media strategy too? Okay, I'm recruiting candidates, people that can get attention. Those are going to be scarier propositions because part of attention is sometimes conflict, provocation, views that are not boring that jump out at you, and interviews and talking to a lot of people where you might say something that is a quote unquote gaffe or that people don't like or offend certain people. The institutional orientation of the Democratic Party is like yeah no, and I think there's a great example of this with Mamdani down the stretch. If talk about his media, he went everywhere, he said yes to everything, he gave an interview to a Pakistani news channel in Urdu. Have you seen this? No. At some level I was like, why are you, this is down the stretch, this is like in the last week, but it's like right, maybe that gets back to Urdu speaking New Yorkers who share the clip, like, you know, he then also goes, goes on mainstream, he goes on alternative, he goes on subway takes, and then he does The Bulwark. Now, The Bulwark is like sort of a, you know, centrist, center right, anti-Trump network. Center left in the, I'm at this point. I Okay, fine. It's center left at this point. It's in the, it's in the big, I love the boy. Tim Miller is great, but uh, it's in the big Democratic. It's in the anti-Trump tent. It's in the anti-Trump, strongly in the anti-Trump tent, but it is founded by people who used to be Republicans and whose feelings about, say, Israel, tend more towards the right of the Democratic coalition. And they ask him this question about this phrase, globalizing, which is a very popular phrase at protests on the left. And maybe some people say that phrase with good intent, but there are certainly some people are saying that phrase with violent intent. So, I wonder what you think about that. He gives an answer that starts off with, I thought, a very long and good thing about Jewish safety and the and the Jewish folks that he's talked to in New York City. And then just a few weeks ago, I had a conversation with a Jewish man in Williamsburg who told me that he, the same door he would keep unlocked for decades, is one that he now locks out of a fear of of what it, what could happen in his own neighborhood. And then he basically says, look, you know, intifada is Arabic for struggle, and uh, that in fact, word is used in the Holocaust Museum website to mean struggle. The very word is has been used by the Holocaust Museum when translating the Warsaw Ghetto uprising into Arabic because it's a word that means struggle. Sure. And as a Muslim man who grew up post 9/11, I'm I'm all too familiar in the way in which Arabic words can be twisted, can be distorted, can be used to justify any kind of meaning. And I think that's that's where it leaves me with a sense that what we need to do is is focus on keeping Jewish New Yorkers safe. And the question of the permissibility of language is something that I that I haven't, I haven't ventured into. And the headline that comes out from it, I don't think it was a great answer to be very clear. Um, is refuses to condemn globalizing. And so I thought to myself, I'm like, \"Oh, okay. So now we're seeing the cost, right? Like we've seen the benefit. He's been everywhere. But going everywhere means you might have a news cycle where you say something like that.\" And I think it's pretty striking that he won anyway, because I do think the old way of thinking is like say no to 10 things if the if it means that you never have the news cycle about globalizing, and him embracing the strategy he did meant that he had a news cycle in a city with a million Jewish voters where like people's views on this can be very strong that was all about him refusing to condemn globalizing in Nevada, a kind of nightmare scenario if you're a political staffer on that campaign. A genuine nightmare scenario that didn't have the effect that I think a lot of people implies the politics of that are not what people think they are. I will say, I I will only speak for myself on this. So my priors on Andrew Cuomo, I was not like an incredible fan of the governorship from afar back when he was being talked about as a presidential candidate, and then everything that happened that led to his resignation struck me as really kind of upsetting. Two things turned, but I was sort of, you know, I'm open to people's redemption, right? If you know, he wants to run a great campaign and he's learned a lot, like, you know, maybe he'll be a good mayor, who knows. Uh, I don't think you can have a, like, I think you have to be open to redemption. Two things about that campaign, one was that the number of people, even people who endorsed Cuomo, who talked to me about his cruelty or his tendency for revenge, like, I amazing sentences, I had somebody tell me he was a sociopath and then endorse him.\n\n\nA couple of days later. And so that was like one line that I just couldn't get over, right? Somebody who, this is the way they have treated people in public life. Like that's a bar I don't, I don't, I want candidates to be above. But the other thing that like actually closed it, that made it for me, that I would not rank him was the way he used Israel in the campaign. Like I, a Jewish person, I have very, very deep feelings about what is happening in Israel and Gaza. And I found it so cynical, so repulsive, just such a vicious way to weaponize. I thought both sort of Zohran Mamdani's ethnicity, but also, I don't know, what's happening in Gaza is a horror. People should be horrified. The mayor of New, like the whole thing just struck me as gross, and I knew a lot of people for whom it read that way.\n\nThe thing in the debates where they got into a fight over like visiting Israel. What's the first country you're going to visit? I would stay in New York City. My plans are to address New Yorkers across the five burroughs and focus on that.\n\nMr. Mamdani, can I just jump in? Would you visit Israel as mayor?\n\nI've said, uh, in a UJA questionnaire that I believe that you need not travel to Israel to stand up for Jewish New Yorkers. And that is what I will be doing as the mayor. I'll be standing up for Jewish New Yorkers, and I'll be meeting them wherever they are across the five burroughs, whether that's in their synagogues and temples or at their homes or at the subway platform because ultimately we need to focus on delivering on their concerns.\n\nYes or no? Do you believe in a Jewish state of Israel?\n\nI believe Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state as a state with equal rights.\n\nHe won't say it has a right to exist as a Jewish state. Be very clear. And his answer was no. He won't visit Israel. I said that. That's what he was trying to say. It was such an obvious political game. Yeah. It was deathlessly cynical. Yes. And I have to say, I mean, it was also comical at a certain level. Like to me, I mean, like my formative years were spent at like Shabbat dinner at my friends' houses and going to bar mitzvahs and and being in this milieu of Jewish New York. And it's incredibly precious to me, and I feel like incredible, like profound, um, gratitude and affection for that. And, you know, my wife's half Jewish, like I'm not like doing the bonafides, but it's, it's close to me. Like I'm not Jewish, but it's a culture that I like, love deeply and feel bound to. And so, yeah, I found it deathlessly cynical. Deathlessly cynical. I mean, comical to the point also where the other thing that complicated this, and this is an interesting angle of this whole thing, is that Andrew Cuomo, like me, is a paison from New York. The guy's not Jewish. Yeah. Brad Lander, who cross-endorsed Mamdani, is Jewish and very devoted to questions around Israel. He's also the highest-ranking Jewish official in New York City. Yes. And so you have Andrew Cuomo. Like I'm like, what are we doing here? Andrew Cuomo. Andrew Cuomo is browbeating.\n\nThis is something I want to get at. A lot of the things that happened in this campaign happened on like a literal level and a metaphorical, symbolic level at the same time. And one thing that I thought about that moment when Mamdani didn't condemn globalizing Nevada was it had this quality of, this is what he believes. He is not going to sell out a politics and a community who he either belongs to or has very, very deep sympathy for why they feel the way they do. And with Cuomo, like I'm not saying he's not, does not have like beliefs about Israel, but it felt like the oppo researchers had come to him with a packet, and he was now going to use what was in the packet. And a lot of things are, are not, I mean, we could talk about the popularity of different ideas, but some things are also just communicating what kind of person you are. But also, I've been very interested by the way that Israel and Gaza have become highly kind of symbolic, like attentional in both directions, right? There is the Gaza is a genocide, you know, direction, and also the people who have made themselves aggressively into like moderates, anti-Israel moderates. And you see this a bit with Cuomo, but you see it with, uh, Richie Torres, right? You see it with John Federman. Yep. Is like the strongest and most consistent fight they pick is on Israel. It's like now, weirdly, the ideological Israel's become the culture war, I think, within the Democratic party. Yeah. And just if you want to really send a strong signal, like I'm just struck by how many of the signals sent for people who do not have a lot of power over, you know, America polic, America policy towards Israel are sent on, on this issue. I think there's, and I think there's also an added dimension to that, which is that there's just enormous estrangement between the establishment of the party and the base of the party. That's right.\n\nUm, I saw the polling on the Iran strikes were like 85% of Democrats opposed, and I think 13% approved. Yeah. Now, if you looked at Democratic legislators' responses, you would not think that those were the numbers. It reminds me a little bit, and I think it's, I think it's actually a dangerous gap for the party because someone will come into that vacuum. Donald Trump really exploited a huge gap between the elites in the party and the establishment on immigration and trade and the base of the party to tremendous effect. There is something like that in the Democratic party right now on the issue of Israel. Um, there is just, you know, poll after poll after poll, and I think this has to do with a bunch of complicated factors, although I think the driving factor has been the war in Gaza since, you know, October 2023, and I think you really saw it play out in this race. I mean, New York City is the most Jewish city in the country and the most Jewish city in the world. One of the most Jewish cities in the world outside Tel Aviv. It's the second, you know, highest number of Jewish citizens. Um, it's also like that number fails to represent how Jewish the city is in terms of its cultural milieu and like, like I said, like the fabric of New York, right? And I think it's shocking to a lot of people, and even to me, I have to say, that someone with his politics on this conflict just won a Democratic primary. Like I, that is really like, and I think it, and did it without, I mean, without shifting from that, like, no, he used to support defund the police, and now I think both says he does it and actually doesn't. I think he does not want to defund the police as as mayor. He held his blind. He is an anti-Zionist, I think, and is now right. He said, like, uh, he Israel should not be a Jewish state. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I think that, and I think you're right that there's, I think there's something, I mean, again, I feel a little weird about this conversation because I really, I, it's thorny for a million reasons, but it's also like, I respect the views of people that are closest to it, and I am not the closest to it. So, I'm always kind of like trying to check that in me. So, it's weird for me to be like, it's bad for the Jews. I'm not a Jew. I think the way this is developing within the Democratic party is kind of dangerous. Yeah. I, I think the idea of like, this is a signifier of the rich elites who control everything behind closed doors, which is both an anti-Semitic trope and something that touches on something close to being true about how money flows in democratic politics is like a really combustible mix. I think that's right. But I say two other things about it being a signifier. One is that it's a signifier in two directions, right? It's a signifier in one direction of being willing to stick to your beliefs, right? That I think a lot of people in the base feel that even Democrats who actually agree with them will not say on Gaza and how bad and and horrifying that has been, will not quite say it or sugarcoat it or will not vote with it. And so there is something both, again, I believe the belief is authentic to Mamdani, but but also expressive, showing that you will stand up to that kind of pressure. Right? In the other direction, um, it's showing that you will not be cowed for your Richie Torres, your Federman's. It's showing you not be cowed by a different thing in the party, right? Like the kind of the woke mob, right? So, it's become a kind of declaration of independence from from that.\n\nI will just say on the the point you just made about how saying something true can, you know, very veer close to saying something, um, anti-Semitic. One thing I have just appreciated about Mamdani, and I appreciate about the Mamdani-Lander Alliance. I'm a Jewish person. It is very important. It is very important that is possible and understood to be possible that you can be anti-Zionist without being anti-Semitic. And I'm not anti-Zionist in that way, right? I'm like a kind of two-state solution person who doesn't really believe that that is possible. And I'm not sure like where I, what I think is plausible at this point. But putting my own politics aside, like I very fundamentally believe like Mandani is anti-Zionist and not anti-Semitic. And he did a very, very, very good job in my view in answers of making that clear. Lander acted as a very important cross-validator for him. But in a world where Israel is going to be as brutal as it has been in Gaza and is going to play much more of a role of like a regional hegemon militarily, which is what it is stepped into. Um, and people are going to have very, very strong opinions, including very, very strong negative opinions on what it means for there to be roughly 7 million Palestinians who do not have equal rights and are under Israeli control. Yeah, it is very, very, very important that there, like you just have to be able to be anti the, like, against what the Israeli state has become and not anti-Semitic, and it's going to be, it is, I think it is an incredibly dangerous game that pro-Zionist people have played trying to conflate those things because if you tell people enough that to oppose Israel is to be anti-Semitic, at some point they're going to say, well, then I guess I'm anti, I guess I'm anti-Semitic. Yeah, that's the, that's the fear.\n\nI, I think that. Yeah. And I think, I think the taboo around anti-Semitism, which is born of the worst atrocities in human history, is like an extremely, like, a wildly important taboo that is breaking down everywhere we look. Like, let's be clear, like that taboo is disintegrating. Yes. And it's disintegrating for a lot of people, and it's, and it's terrifying that it's disintegrating. And I, you know, the one thing I'll say again, and this is me, like, offering advice that no one asked for from the position of just like, you know, the Catholic boy from the Bronx who now lives in Brooklyn. But like, I also think there's tangible, concrete things. I think there's tangible, concrete things that Mandani can do. Like he should be going to Burough Park, and he should be going, you know, to Ocean Parkway, and he should be talking to folks there and being like, we're not going to agree on Israel. Let's just say that from the beginning. I want you to feel safe and heard. I want your communities to thrive. I want the city to work for you. Like, let's talk about how we make that happen. And I think there are tangible, like, there's huge security concerns. Huge. Yeah. If you heard him on Coar, I thought he did a very beautiful job walking that line. Yeah, I agree. You know, I remember the words of Mayor Koch, who said, \"If you agree with me on nine out of 12 issues, vote for me. 12 out of 12, see a psychiatrist.\" And and I had an older Jewish woman come up to me at Banana Jesher in a synagogue many months ago after a Democratic club forum, and she whispered in my ear, \"I disagree with you on one issue. I'm pretty sure you know which one it is, and I agree with you on the others, and I'm going to be ranking you on your, on my ballot.\" And I say this because I know there are many New Yorkers with whom I have a disagreement about the Israeli government's policies. And also there are many who understand that that's a disagreement still rooted in shared humanity because the conclusions I've come to. They are the conclusions of Israeli historians like Amos Goldberg. They are echoing the words of an Israeli prime minister, Ahud Mayor, who said just recently, what we are doing in Gaza is a war of devastation. It is cruel. It is indiscriminate. It is limitless. It is criminal killing of civilians. These are the conclusions I've come.\n\nStephen, can I, I think that is a good place to end. As a final question, what are three books you'd recommend to the audience?\n\nUm, I, this is an oldie but a goodie. The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco, which is the most recent novel, uh, I've read. I, it was one of these things that I started, put down for months, and then took back up. And you know how you do that with novels where you're like, I sort of remember where we are, but the book is incredible. Um, the, the second one is an incredible book that is not out yet that I am able to read an advanced reader copy of. It's by Rob Mali and Hussein Agha. It's called Tomorrow's Yesterday. Scott recommended the last episode, too. It's really something else. I mean, these two, partly it's, it's beautifully written. It's two people that have genuinely incredibly distinct, um, perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and who have been in the room. Yes. Um, at a bunch of times. So, that, that is a great book. And the last book is a history of the cultural revolution called Mao's Last Revolution by Michael Shenhouse and Roderick Macfarquhar. It's a history of the cultural revolution. And I don't know why I suddenly was seized with an interest in reading about the cultural revolution, except that I was looking to escape to a political session, escape to a political environment that was like more dire and toxic than our own doom reading. So I like, for some reason, like, scrambled that, and I read, uh, that book's amazing, although I mean, my god, um, sort of suffocating in some ways to be inside that universe. And then there are like a few whiffs of familiarity that are unnerving.\n\nChris Hayes, always such a pleasure, man. Thank you. Loved it.\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
