  "cleanText": "Have you ever found yourself agitated or confounded or just sick of the current state of affairs and wondered what it might be like to live in another time? I do not belong to this time period. I know it sounds crazy, but when I wore armor and I'm sitting in front of a castle in Germany or in Poland, I felt like I belong there. You know, I feel at home. For some people, home is in the Middle Ages. It appears to be a simpler time. People worked hard and played hard. It seems exotic to us now. The exotic place these people are in is New Jersey at the Burlington County Fairgrounds. It's a warm, sticky Sunday in June, and they are attending the annual New Jersey Renaissance Fair. Fair with an E at the end. Despite the heat, they're wearing woolen vests and long-sleeved dresses, heavy boots. Also, among the men, a lot of very bushy beards. Matt Schwarz is one of the musical performers. He is a harpist. I think nowadays, you look at a world that doesn't have a lot of our modern problems and you think it was perfect. Of course, back then, they had their own problems, but I think there's much to be said with a world in which you're in touch with the outdoors and nature. Jordan Cavalier is another musical performer.\n\nThis is called the Nickel Harper. It's a Swedish key fiddle. It's 16 strings of medial Swedish glory. It has three melody strings, one drone string, and 12 sympathetic strings. I started playing 6 years ago. And now I'm here at Renfair playing it. This is like my life now.\n\n[Music]\n\nIn the US alone, there are a couple hundred Renaissance fairs each year. They give you a chance to hear period music, eat a turkey leg or a giant pickle, and pretend that you are not only in a different time, but that you are a different person. I am Sir Malagan, the Knight of Fortitude, part of the Knights of Virtue, soon to fight in the Tournament of Virtue here at 1:30 on the field.\n\nOkay. So, there's two knights on like different horses on opposing sides and they're they have like their jousting stick and they're trying to get the rings. So, whichever one gets the rings, they get the point.\n\n[Applause]\n\nAnother knight, Paul Mafy, emerges from his jousting tournament, sweaty and winded. It's almost been a year since I armored up and I love it there. It was exhausting, but I could do it again in 10 minutes. The adrenaline gets going and you just get in there. It's just you and him. That's all you see cuz you can't see anything else in the helmet. And it's great.\n\nOkay, so that's what they're all doing here. What are we doing here? When we set out to make a three-part series about the ark of human life, we knew we would begin with birth and child rearing. That was last week's episode. You can catch up later if you missed it. We also knew that the final episode would be about aging and death. But what about the middle episode? We thought it would be interesting to explore what it's like to be middle-aged. But then you realize that our current concept of middle-aged is very new. At the beginning of the 20th century, average life expectancy was only 31 years old. Now, that number on its own is misleading. There were plenty of old people and middle-aged people, too. But the average was brought down by the incredibly high rate of child mortality. So, we got to wondering, what was it like to be middle-aged back in the Middle Ages? And we asked the Renaissance Fair attendees a simple question. If you could go back, would you go back? I'd rather be middle-aged pretty much any century of the Middle Ages. That was rough rough time. I would have not survived anything. No, I need like a Marriott, but I need like a JW Marriott. I don't even survive this when it rains. So, we have this thing today called ibuprofen. That is a very, very powerful help to being middle-aged. So, that's how the fairgoers feel. Today on Freakonomics Radio, we get an expert view on what it was like to be middle-aged in the Middle Ages. Ibuprofen not included.\n\n[Music]\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host, Stephen J. Dubner.\n\n[Music]\n\nThe Middle Ages, as agreed upon by most historians, cover the years from roughly 500 to 1500. Most historians also agree that Renaissance fairs are not entirely accurate. So, we decided to speak with a couple of actual historians. My name is Nestle Han Shenjak and I teach medieval history at Colombia University. How would you describe generally your research interests? My research interests are mostly in religious history of the Middle Ages, specifically history of Christianity. But because religion is so pervasive in the medieval world, basically every other type of history falls into the religious history that is social history, political history and everything. So I basically study everything. How did you come to this particular concentration? My story is a little bit unusual really because I actually graduated from college as an industrial engineer. Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's a change. That is a change. But then in the last year of engineering, I had read Umberto Eco's *Name of the Rose* and there I met for the first time the Franciscan order. What is special about Franciscan order is that they really wanted to be poor, very very poor, poorer than everybody else. And I thought, who on earth might like to be poor? That seemed to me so strange, such a great contrast to modern life when everybody wants to be rich. I was very fascinated from the beginning with the monks and friars life. Now I see a lot of problems in that kind of life that I didn't see before. For instance, for instance, no matter how hard they try, their passions and moral issues do not leave them. We think that the monks are calm and peaceful, dedicating their lives to God. But when you read the sources, it's not like that. They are very much acting. They could be angry and horny. Exactly. And corrupt and greedy.\n\nOkay. So that's Nestle Shenjak, our first scholar of the Middle Ages. Let's meet the other one. My name is Philip Scoffield. I'm a medieval historian at Abberiswith. That's a university in Wales. My main interests are in the broad air of economic history and I work particularly on peasantry. What would you say drew you to the study of peasantry? As an undergraduate, I was really intrigued by the broad socio-economic history that medievalists especially in France were doing looking at the social structure of medieval villages. When I read about the work of archaeologists and others who find physical evidence or ruins, it always seems a bit miraculous that things have survived from so long ago and yet it does happen. When you study economic history, I'm curious what the evidence is like and if it feels as though you're always reaching through a veil of sorts, never quite getting to the reality. That's always the sense on one level. When I was doing my doctorate, I wrote at one stage something like, \"He probably thought that.\" And my supervisor, someone called Barbara Harvey, she said, \"What are you doing? You don't probably think it. You either know it or you don't know it. And if you don't know it, leave it out.\" That's sort of old, but I it it appeals to me really. I imagine if I walk through a 14th century peasant village on the basis of my understanding from 14th century records, there's undoubtedly a lot of things that would surprise me. But there are local court records, memorial records that are really the records generated by lords but include a huge amount of incidental information directed at the peasantry including for example litigation. That's something I work on quite a bit is actually peasants not litigating with their lords but peasants litigating with each other.\n\nI asked Philip Scoffield if he was willing to imagine the daily life of a middle-aged peasant from that era. Maybe a composite figure based on bits and pieces of Scofield's research. He was actually able to do us one better than that. I did write something almost 30 years ago now in a journal called *Past and Present* about two peasants who litigated. So they're both real people. And because they were extremely enthusiastic litigants, they tended to be more evident and because they were relatively wealthy, they were also more evident and they also exist in taxation data. So that's the kind of person I would maybe go to. Excellent. Of these two peasant litigants, I need you to pick one that you can describe for us. Who would you prefer? I will pick someone called Robert the son of Adam. Okay. Robert, the son of Adam. Where does he live? He lived in a place called Hindercllay in Suffukk. And what year would you like to place Robert, the son of Adam, in Hindercllay? That would count as his middle age. Let's say about 1305. I hope he's not dead by then. He was certainly active around that time and was doing pretty well. How old is he? I would say he was probably in his 30s and that counts as middle-aged then, I think. So, yeah. I was thinking about this today and what I know about calculations of life expectancy. Most of that is really hard to do from the records I've describing, but it's really monastic evidence from the 15th century where you've got a whole range of moments in a monk's life in places like Westminster Abbey and Durham Cathedral Priary and so on. And then you can follow them through various administrative tasks and then often they end up in the infirmary and their deaths are recorded. The estimates for that tend to suggest that life expectancy is taking people into their late 40s50.\n\nOkay, we will return later to Robert, son of Adam, a relatively wealthy peasant in Hindercllay, England. I asked Nestle Shenjak, who grew up in Turkey, what it's like to really immerse yourself in medieval history. It gives you perspective. It gives you an alternative. It takes you out of the bubble which is modern life. When we grow up, we are born into this life. We sometimes think that this is the only way things could be. But it could have been another way. So if I asked you to switch places with someone from that period, would you be willing or interested? If I'm going to have my kids with me, yes. If certain conditions are met, I guess I would. Yeah. Cuz it's a much simpler life. I'd like to be an artisan in a city, I guess. What would you make? Stained glass would be nice. I mean, stained glass is so beautiful. People in the Middle Ages had their shops actually inside their homes, so I don't have to even go somewhere else. Where exactly would you choose to live? Let's make it Italy. In a city or rural? It has to be a city really. Italian cities were much more advanced in the 13th century, much better organized. You have free healthcare, free education. If I'm rural, then I would have to be a peasant. And you want to be an artisan? Yes, I'd rather be an artisan. I think being a peasant requires far too much energy, which I don't think I have. Let's start with the city. Where will you live? Well, I quite like Florence, so it would have to be Florence. What year shall we pick? 1250s would be good. In real life today, do you have a spouse or partner? I do have a spouse. Yes. And he's Italian, actually.\n\nSo Nestle Shenjak has raised the stakes by including herself in our exercise and she's bringing along her husband and two sons. I asked Philip Scoffield what we know about the family of Robert, the son of Adam. He's got a brother. Beyond that, it's difficult to be entirely sure. We do know from other contemporaries that if he was fairly typical, he would have a wife and maybe a small number of surviving children, some of whom would survive into adulthood. So, it's quite reasonable to suppose that he had three or four children who move beyond infancy. What do his children do? At what age do they start to perhaps work with him? Well, they were still really young, you know, less than 10. So smallcale hering, managing crops, keeping birds off things, helping with harvest and so on. What level of education would these kids be getting? Education is fairly limited. A lot of education is the education of the village in a sense of learning from doing in some ways. What does Robert eat and drink? The bulk of his diet would have been predominantly grainbased, but leavened by fish, both sea fish and freshwater fish. Maybe a little bit of meat, probably bacon, but also poultry. Quite a lot of ale in his diet. Is there a relatively low alcohol version of ale that children and others would drink since it was safer than water? I mean, children are drinking ale definitely. Whether it's low alcohol or not, it's difficult to be entirely sure. Obviously in Florence, you would have access to very good wine. What would a family dinner look like? It would definitely have vegetables and fruits. Meat is a little bit more problematic for medieval people cuz it's expensive. Pork and chicken would be cheaper than beef. So, we might have that maybe once a week. People did consume a lot of beans and lentils and things like that also because they were durable. They don't go bad. We wouldn't obviously have any fridge or anything, not even a seller. But also, of course, the main staple of any diet is the bread. Say a bit more about why you were determined to put yourself in a city and not a village or the countryside. The big difference is that you are much less exposed to the elements. City life is pretty safe compared to the rural life because the cities are walled. They are very well protected. In the countryside, you do get raids. You might have animals coming in, wild animals, which were much more in number in the Middle Ages than they are now. Obviously, they've been hunted down over the years. There is food insecurity in the countryside. I wouldn't have food insecurity because generally what the medieval cities like Florence did, they had big granaries. They stored grain just in case there's famine and then they would distribute it to the citizens. Let's talk about the state of commerce. How does that work? How much do you make and what are you able to buy with it? I would have to find commissioned jobs. If I'm a stained glass maker, that would mean either a church or a monastery would have to give me orders. There are lots of churches, many more than now. And if a church can afford having\n\n\nStained glass, which would be expensive, I think I can make a decent amount of money to be what corresponds today to middle class.\nOkay.\nSo, you're a middle class, middle-aged artisan in the Middle Ages.\nYes, that's a lot of middle.\nThat's okay.\nThat's why we're here.\nWhat is it like to be a freelance artisan then?\nWell, the thing is I would have to enter the guilt of stained glass makers.\nAll the trades were very well organized.\nToday's trade unions, they really have their origins in the Middle Ages.\nSo, I would have to pay dues to my guilt.\nI would have to be registered as a master of state class.\nAnd the amount of money I can charge would be regulated by them.\nWhen you read economic history, the economists are usually anti-gild because they see guilds as monopolistic within their domain.\nThere was actually this famous economic essay about how the candlemakers guild were trying to have a resolution passed that forbade the sun from shining at certain times because with too much sunlight there was less demand for their products.\nPlainly that was not quite real, but the sentiment I think was legitimate.\nI'm curious, how would you feel about your guild?\nWould you feel it's generally a positive for you and for the rest of society?\nPositive for you and a negative for the others or maybe even negative for you because you have to join this guild and pay dues and have your wages probably set as opposed to being a true freelancer.\nWell, I'm not inflicted with the less a fair ideas of the modern economy which I consider a good thing.\nThe guilt is a very good thing for the people inside it.\nIt's a very bad negative thing for the people who are outside because then you cannot find a job.\nThat is if a freelance stained glass maker comes to Florence, they would not be legally able to work.\nBut the guilt has so many benefits.\nYes, I do pay dues.\nThat for example if I ever fall into hardship, if I get sick, they come and help me.\nThere are even religious benefits.\nAll the guilt members are expected to pray for one another at the time of sickness and especially after death.\nWould you have an appetite for expanding your business, maybe renting a bigger workshop and hiring people and becoming a big-time commercial person yourself?\nWhether I'm some kind of a protocolist.\nNo, I can't imagine that.\nI chose the medieval life because it is the simpler one.\nThe more people get into your life, the more difficult your life becomes.\nI'd rather try to have a small life.\nI don't have to deal with too many people.\nThe customers are enough and my kids and the partner.\nOkay.\nAnd how about the economic life of Robert, son of Adam, our peasant friend in Hindercllay, England.\nA peasant in this period could be relatively wealthy.\nI mean, not as wealthy as an aristocrat or a major land owner, but within their community, they can be wealthier than others.\nAnd for Hindle and Robert, the son of Adam, we have very good taxation data, which places him at or near the top of his own community.\nHow exactly does Robert make his living and how has he done so well?\nThat's an interesting one.\nA lot of his activity is to do with production of grain and farming his land almost certainly with some livestock as well.\nWhat's interesting about Robert from taxation records is he has a much higher proportion of a single grain than almost anybody else in his community which suggests he's probably not involved in some monoulture but is probably buying and selling and accumulating as a grain factor.\nOh, I see.\nSo he raises a crop but he's also a merchant I think.\nSo I see.\nAnd what is his grain?\nIn this particular part of the country barley is a predominant crop.\nPeople also produce wheat, oats, rye, peas, beans, you know, but the predominant crop is barley and that's where a lot of his wealth is held.\nAnd what would you say are the characteristics of Robert that enabled him to become not just a farmer but a merchant?\nIs he particularly clever?\nIs he a bit of a bully?\nDo you think he's honest?\nMy sense is he is clever.\nMy sense is that he's actually I often use the term aggressively inquisitive.\nI think he's someone who knows how to maximize opportunity.\nSome people have that ability, don't they?\nAnd some people don't.\nHis brother, William, the son of Adam, is also quite well-to-do in the village, but in a more traditional way.\nAnd I think that maybe they're born into a family that's relatively well to do, though we don't have the records that allow us to see that.\nSo he probably is relatively well off in capital terms to begin with, but also knows how to play that, how to use markets, how to advantage himself, and particular how to use law to support that.\nWhen things start to go against him in any way, he's very quick to turn to law, very quick to actually bring people into court, to sue them, to not give up.\nI don't know whether he's a bully, but I do think he knows what he wants and is prepared to push hard to get it.\nHow much land does he have?\nHe has something in the region of 20 acres of land.\nSo he may be investing in a nice house, a reasonably nice house.\nIt would be probably a single level possibly with a slightly raised area above it.\nThere might be a distinction between a living quarters for people and perhaps a space to the other side of it where livestock might be kept.\nAre there windows in this house?\nIn this house, probably more shutters, certainly not glass windows.\nAnd what are the building materials outside and inside?\nYou might be talking about a kind of wle and dorbing, a combination of mud plaster mixed in with straw and things like horseair and a wooden frame which you attach that to a fairly basic stone flooring as well.\nWhat's the furniture look like?\nWooden furniture, locally made wooden furniture.\nSome of it might be quite ornate.\nHe might copy his lord in the way in which he arranges that living space.\nSo he might seat himself at the end of a table with his family in relative seniority closer or further away from him.\nFor example, he might invest in some decent table wear.\nSilver, possibly not, but good pottery.\nHow many channels does he get on his television?\nI'm guessing fewer than five.\nNot so many.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nProbably.\nSo this lord you mentioned, tell me about him.\nRobert is a villain or a surf.\nSo he's an unfree peasant.\nSo he technically belongs to his lord.\nYou kind of buried the lead on me there.\nThat's a big deal, isn't it?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBut at the same time, he's in a community that is both free and unfree.\nSo around him, there might be free peasants, and he's an unfreed peasant.\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean he's significantly disadvantaged.\nThe relationship between freedom and unfreedom in the medieval village could be almost reversed.\nSome of the people who hold free land might be relatively poor people holding relatively small plots whereas the unfree might be relatively privileged individuals except that they obviously have restrictions on their mobility and so on and so forth.\nSo if Robert is essentially owned or circumscribed by his lord what are some of the upsides and downsides of that?\nThere are some people who say well villainage is actually not an impediment.\nIt's a safety net because the Lord cares about his villains.\nThey are his bread and butter in a sense.\nHe protects them.\nHe doesn't want to be overly demanding of them.\nThat customary rents they pay are fairly low and fixed.\nOthers would say that villainage is an imposition.\nIt's a restriction of basic freedoms.\nIt means that if you want to marry off your daughter, you have to pay a fine.\nIf you want to leave as a young man, you have to pay a fine.\nAnything you do effectively is through the permission of the Lord.\nWho is Robert's lord?\nHis lord is the monastery.\nIt's the monastery of Beris and Edmunds which is a long-established benedicting monastery.\nVery traditional relatively hard-hearted I would say and clearly gains the antagonism of local people.\nThis brings us to an interesting and important point.\nThe power of the church in the Middle Ages.\nWe will get into that after the break.\nAlso how the criminal justice system worked.\nThey would go around and ask people what gossip they have heard.\nI'm Steven Dubner.\nThis is Freakonomics Radio.\nWe'll be right back.\nWe've been speaking with two middle-aged scholars of the Middle Ages about what it would be like to have been middle-aged in the Middle Ages.\nPhilip Scoffield was describing a fairly prosperous English peasant named Robert, the son of Adam, who was in a sort of captive business relationship with a local monastery.\nThis is early 14th century.\nMeanwhile, in 13th century Florence, Nestle Shenjac, a historian at Colombia, has imagined herself living with her actual family from today, and she is making stained glass for a living.\nThis means that she like Robert the son of Adam was in a financial relationship with the church.\nAnd let's remember the Middle Ages were a very churchy time.\nHere is Shenjek.\nIn the Middle Ages there is not even a word for religion really.\nIt's a modern world.\nPeople have this faith in many ways determines everything they do.\nHow they rule people, how they work, how they talk to each other, how they write.\nYou think that you living back then would be relatively devout?\nRelatively, not too much.\nHow central and in what ways was religion central to your family?\nIt would be central in the sense that my two boys would have to be baptized and they would be baptized in the cathedral of the city cuz when you live in a city, that's where they get the baptism.\nWe would regularly go to the Church and as much as I can find time from my work, I would also try to go to the morning and evening prayers during the weekdays.\nWhat is your relationship to the Church, capital C church, not the actual parish?\nHow do you think about the Church or God or the saints in relation to your life?\nSo because I live in a city, I would have actually much more access to the capital C church than someone living in the countryside cuz their experience would only be the parish.\nBut I can see the cathedral.\nI can see the bishop.\nI think I would feel as many people did feel then a little bit angry and upset that they are just far too rich.\nThe bishop has got goldplated ropes and everything and the cathedral is so big.\nThey eat really well.\nThere might be some resentment about that that that doesn't reflect the poor Christ.\nWhen you think about yourself as this artisan with your family and let's say you felt some of that resentment, follow that thought through a bit further for me.\nWhen you think about where that wealth comes from, what do you think then?\nThe wealth of the Church really comes from the donations and the wills.\nThat's how it built up over the centuries.\nIt's the people that made the institutional Church rich.\nBut there is also the fact that the Church after the 9th century started to collect tithes which were taxes.\nSo one tenth of my income has to go to my parish which is quite a lot more than the guild fees probably.\nYes.\nYes.\nI would think so.\nAnd how would you feel about that tithing?\nI don't know.\nI think I would force myself to think about it as a good religious deed that at least I'm giving it to the Church and 1/4 of those tithes are supposed to go to the poor.\nThe Church is supposed to sustain the poor.\nSo I would hope that the money I'm giving is really going into the good hands.\nNow let's say your husband comes home from work one day and says, \"Wow, you would not believe how beautiful the new wing of the monastery is.\nIt looks like it was built for, you know, an Egyptian pharaoh.\nI wouldn't feel good about that.\nThey are monks.\nThey're supposed to imitate Christ.\nThey're supposed to leave poor as poor as they can.\nI mean, they don't have to die out of hunger, but they don't need a luxurious new wing.\nAnd that money could have gone to the poor.\nNow, I want to be fair.\nI just made that up.\nWhat were the monasteries like in Florence at that period?\nWell, you know, they were quite grand, if I may say.\nI went back to Philip Scoffield who teaches at a Welsh university whose name I have a hard time pronouncing.\nSo here's him saying it.\nAbraiswith.\nAbberiswith.\nAbberiswith.\nAnd I asked if his 14th century peasant friend Robert son of Adam was a regular churchgoer.\nAlmost certainly.\nThis is a Orthodox Catholic country at this stage.\nThe room for stepping outside of perceived appropriate religious practices is relatively minimal.\nThere's a big debate about what attendance meant relative to belief, but certainly people do attend and would expect to attend in a fairly regular way.\nAlso, at different points in your life may be going on pilgrimage.\nWhere would a pilgrimage be too?\nSome people go to Jerusalem.\nSome people might go somewhere in Western Europe, but also they may attend pilgrimage within England.\nWhat does Robert think about God or how does he conceive God?\nGiven that Christian teaching is to be charitable and to love thy neighbor as thyself and so on, I can imagine people paying lip service to that, but certainly from a lot of contemporary commentary, and I think probably Robert would fall into that from my reading of him, people struggled to actually follow it through in their daily lives.\nWould he have believed in curses?\nAnd was he perhaps on either the receiving or giving end of a curse?\nReally hard to know that from this period because it's not showing up in quite the same way in our records.\nCertainly, people talk nastily about each other.\nThe gossip and hearsay was so much bigger source of information in the Middle Ages than it is now.\nYou would rely a lot on what other neighbors tell you.\nAnd they did it without social media even.\nExactly.\nThat was the social media basically gossip and hearsay.\nThat was also the basis of the criminal justice system by the way.\nWhat do you mean?\nThat's how they found the suspects.\nThey would go around and ask people what gossip they have heard.\nIf a crime has been committed and no one knows who committed it.\nBut then at a certain point you try to gather some actual evidence.\nYes, that would be really difficult without forensic science.\nIf you think about the way the modern criminal justice system works, if there are no witnesses to a crime, what are your fallbacks?\nFingerprints and DNA analysis.\nNone of that existed.\nSo, what do you think the false conviction rate was?\nIn a place like Rome or Peru, which are neighboring places to Florence, the conviction rate was so low, only 10% of trials resulted in a conviction.\n90% would be let go out of the reason that there is not enough evidence to convict them because the judges had it on their conscience if they wrongfully sent somebody to execution.\nSo they would have to let them go if there is not enough evidence.\nWas\n\n\nThe legal system, informed by religious feeling or religious devotion?\nOh yes, absolutely.\nJudges and the juries would always take an oath that they are going to follow the procedure.\nThey are going to tell the truth.\nSomehow people really have taken that quite seriously, especially the judges.\nYou can see that they are cringing not to give in.\nThey don't want to execute people.\nThey are very afraid that in the other life God will see them as a murderer if they do that without sufficient evidence.\nAnd then do they conversely assume that if someone did commit a crime but there is no evidence and the judge doesn't want to convict, do they assume that that criminal will be punished anyway by God?\nIt's not that they think that God will punish them anyway.\nSo let us not punish them.\nThat is not the case because they definitely did understand that if you do not hold people accountable then crime will increase.\nYou do need to deter people.\nHow is that balance struck with such a low conviction rate?\nThis low conviction rate belongs to the period where the trial started by an accusation.\nThere are two types of trials.\nThe ones that start basically because I go and say to the judge my neighbor stole from me and that would start a trial against my neighbor.\nI would denounce my neighbor myself but then I would have to prove the guilt.\nI see.\nAnd the other way after 1250s you get a new trial which is the basis of the modern trial we have: inquisition trials.\nThe state starts the trial.\nThe state makes a case against a person based on the public rumors based on gossip and then the conviction rate goes higher.\nPeople resented that, especially in England, the start of the inquisition trial.\nThey said the state has no business interfering into people's conflicts.\nInteresting.\nIt has been seen as an infringement into the rights of the people.\nYou mentioned this change came around 1250.\nThere must have been a period where both systems were operating at the same time.\nYes.\nExactly.\nVery good.\nIn fact, if you go to the judiciaries which still hold the ancient medieval records, there are two books there: the book of acquisitions and book of inquisitions.\nHow long did the accusations last?\nWhen did that die out?\nWell, uh, that's a very good question and frankly I do not know the answer, but it went on for a very long time.\nIt was considered a right of the people to accuse someone who committed a crime against them.\nComing up after the break, let's talk about dying in the Middle Ages.\nThe people we spoke with at the Renaissance Fair in New Jersey had some things to say about that.\nI don't think I would have survived a lot.\nI'm clumsy.\nI'm weak.\nI probably would have broke my back pulling a plow or been trampled down by a Viking invader.\nI would have not survived anything.\nI would like to think I would have survived the bubonic plague, but when the hand of the reaper comes a sweeping across Europe and wipes out a sizable percentage of the population, it doesn't matter what you did.\nI'm Steven Dubner.\nThis is Free Economics Radio.\nWe'll be right back.\nOkay, let's talk about death and dying during the Middle Ages.\nAs we all know, the definitive historical account comes from Monty Python in the Holy Grail.\nBring out your dead.\nBring out your dead one.\nNine.\nI'm not dead.\nWhat?\nNothing.\nHere's your nine.\nI'm not dead.\nHere.\nHe says he's not dead.\nYes, he is.\nI'm not.\nHe isn't?\nWell, he will be soon.\nHe's very ill.\nI'm getting better.\nNo, you're not.\nYou'll be stoned dead in a moment.\nI can't take him like that.\nIt's against regulations.\nAnd here is an actual historian, Philip Scoffield.\nUndoubtedly, death was there.\nI mean, death is always there.\nEven today, apparently.\nYeah, apparently.\nSo I've heard in the second decade of the 14th century there is a period known as the great famine where maybe 10 to 15% of the population died.\nWe can't really see the total impact of that because the most vulnerable are the least visible.\nWe tend to think of peasant households as being complex and full of generations but in reality they probably weren't mostly because people didn't live long enough really for that to happen.\nSomething we don't know a lot about for this period but we know about for later periods is infant mortality.\nIf you had a number of children then the strong likelihood is you would also have a considerable degree of loss in your life because of that.\nViolent death is also reasonably prevalent.\nAnd what about medicine in 14th century England?\nWhat happens when Robert the son of Adam or someone in his family is sick?\nThey have a monastic community that's their lord.\nSo they may seek support from their community.\nThere are be an infirmary there.\nThere are things called hospitals but they tend to be relatively lowcale.\nUnlike in Tuscanyany for example where this period there are substantial hospitals.\nHere they are intended to house and support a symbolic number of poor often the equivalent to the number of the apostles for example.\nBut you would have people that would travel around offering a range of skills including some limited medical skill.\ntow people who are barber surgeons who might help set an arm or do something like that.\nNestle Shenjac, you will remember, located herself and her family in Florence.\nThis is starting to look like a wise choice.\nThere were public hospitals in Florence.\nSo, if you're really sick and you need to be taken care of, then you can go there and anybody who volunteers there, they would take care of you for free.\nStill the health care is obviously compared to the modern knowledge that we have is much more limited.\nThey just do not know what are the causes of the many diseases.\nAntibiotics will go a long way to treat bubonic plague.\nBut in the Middle Ages obviously that was not available.\nAcross Western Europe between 1347 and 1350 possibly 45% of the population died.\nWhat's remarkable is how society cope with that.\nI don't know how modern society would cope with 45% mortality, but there is enormous continuity.\nThere's a lot of contemporary comment and shock and fearfulness, but also the local records I was talking about record for instance repeatedly X has died, Y has died, Zed has died and so on.\nYou get that persistence of normality in the face of something that was utterly abnormal.\nNestle, how about you?\nLiving in 13th century Florence with your husband and two sons.\nHow do you think about death?\nYes, that's the big question.\nI would worry about it.\nWhat will happen to me when I die?\nAnd if I'm a devout Christian, definitely I would believe in afterlife.\nSo I would try to prepare myself and not leave it to old age because that's actually what a lot of people have done even in the Middle Ages.\nThey live their youth rather frivolously.\nHow old would you expect to live until?\nThat depends on so many conditions but I would hope that I can live until maybe 55, 60.\nHow old are you now in real life?\n52.\nI didn't realize I was speaking with you so close to the end of your life.\nWell, yeah.\nI'm going to miss you.\nWell, there will be somebody else in my place doing the stained glass.\nNo, no, no.\nI don't mean your stained glass.\nI mean, I've taken a liking to you during this conversation.\nWhen you said 52, I imagined you living easily till 70 or 75.\nNo, I don't think that very often happened to ordinary medieval citizens.\nI asked Philip Scoffield if he would have liked to live during the period he studies.\nI think for a short period of time I'd be interested.\nOne of the things that would be shocking would be the level of casual cruelty.\nThese villages where people are living fairly close to a marginal existence can be harsh places.\nA woman cropped up in litigation that I was looking at recently who had been told to return eight hens that she'd purchased from somebody and he then said, \"Well, she's defamed me because she did return the eight hens, but she'd stitch their heads together.\"\nOh, I think that hints at a kind of culture that we might find difficult to immediately just settle into.\nIf you did have that opportunity.\nI mean, we're just talking about time travel here now, which is a constant fascination for so many of us.\nWhat are maybe one or two of the most unanswered or perhaps unanswerable questions about that life that you as an economic historian would really love to crack?\nWhat I'd mentioned earlier would be the proportion of the truly vulnerable.\nWhat does that society look like?\nIf you walk down a street, do you see in a village people that are mostly doing fine and supporting each other or do you see desperation alongside relative prosperity?\nSo, it's not a particularly pleasant angle, but I think it's an important one.\nThe degree of social inequality is something that our sources don't really give us full insight into.\nAnd would your main motivation for understanding that be gratitude from a modern perspective or simply empirical verification?\nIt would mostly be empirical in a sense that I'd really want to know what are the hidden stories in our history that we're not picking up.\nThat has its own solitary lessons of course for our contemporary society about how we think of ourselves and what we miss in our society and how we ignore those that perhaps are not as advantaged as others.\nYou know what are we missing?\nThere was someone called Rogers writing in the 19th century who said what he wouldn't give for a history of the medieval village when so much of our history is wasted on the froth of kings and queens and I went back to Nestlehan Shenjac too.\nAt the beginning of this conversation you said you think you would prefer to live then as long as you could take your family with you.\nNow that we've talked about all these different elements, the economics and the legal system and religiosity and food, etc., etc., I'm curious how you're feeling about your choice.\nYou'd prefer to be there then, even though according to you, you'd only have a few more years of life left, and it sounds like you're going to spend a lot of that life in church repenting and so on, or would you rather stay with us here?\nWell, that's a difficult question cuz you know I have a really nice life here too.\nBut for one thing, I don't see the point of trying to live longer and longer.\nIt's the same thing just more.\nIt depends on how I live the life.\nThat might be naive of me.\nThe stress was much less in the Middle Ages.\nNow we have to deal with a million things.\nThe technology in so many ways has made our life hell: the social media, the emails that you have to reply, electronic banking and taxes that you have to figure out.\nAlso, the fact that you don't have electricity in many ways, you do get a very good rest.\nYou don't keep working at night.\nWill you take me with you?\nIf you're ready, yes.\nDo you think you can do it?\nI don't know.\nAt the beginning of this conversation, I never would have thought so, but you're fairly persuasive.\nYeah.\nWell, I have to be.\nI teach this, you know.\nI'm always looking for converts.\nWhen we first had the idea for this episode to explore what it would be like to have been middle-aged in the Middle Ages, I thought it might be a ridiculous pursuit.\nBut now that we've made the episode, I don't think it's ridiculous at all.\nIt's something I love about history and historians.\nThey are so good at bringing you into their world that your mind starts racing with comparisons to your own time.\nThe benefits of the modern world are massive.\nBut as Nestle Shenjac pointed out, there are also significant costs.\nThe more people get into your life, the more difficult your life becomes.\nAnd so I I'd rather try to have a small life.\nHow do you think about our time versus that one?\nWould you want to go back?\nUnder what circumstances?\nLet us know.\nOur email is radio@freeconomics.com.\nComing up next time on the show, consider this fact.\nFor the first time in history, there will soon be more older adults living in the US than children.\nOne of the great achievements of the 20th century is to produce an aging society.\nIt's so weird we see it so negative.\nWe talked to the scientists, economists, investors, and historians trying to give this aging society a new kind of future.\nThat's next time on the show.\nUntil then, take care of yourself and if you can, someone else, too.\nFreconomics Radio is produced by Stitcher
