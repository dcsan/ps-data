  "cleanText": "Hey there, it's Stephen Dubner. We heard from a lot of listeners who really liked our most recent episode, which was called \"What It's Like to Be Middle-Aged in the Middle Ages.\" So, I figured you might want a little bit more medieval programming. Here is a bonus episode. It's an updated version of an episode we first published in 2013. It's called \"What Do Medieval Nuns and Bo Jackson Have in Common?\" The answer is probably not what you think. As always, thanks for listening.\n\n[Music]\n\nIt probably was pretty darn painful because you're not living in a world with good razors. The chances are what they're using is kitchen cutlery, I would imagine. And that is not necessarily all that sharp. I can't imagine how painful it was. That's Lii Oliver. When we spoke with her for this episode around 12 years ago, she was studying medieval law at Louisiana State University. And what do you think she's talking about that was so darn painful? Between the 5th and the 12th century in early modern Europe, barbarity swept through the continent and also the island of England. And often the targets of these attacks were monasteries and nunneries. But nunneries, you had the added incentive of rape to add to sort of pillage and destruction. For a nun, rape was especially problematic. Aside from the obvious reasons, rape violated a nun's chastity, which meant that as a bride of Christ, she might be forbidden entry into heaven. So, what do you do if you are a nun and there are barbarians at the gate? In the 9th century, one nun, an abbess who came to be known as St. Eba, came up with a plan. Here's Lucy Oliver reading from a history by Roger of Wendover.\n\nThe abbess with an heroic spirit took a razor and with it cut off her nose, together with her upper lip onto the teeth, presenting herself a horrible spectacle to those who stood by. Filled with admiration at this admirable deed, the whole assembly followed her maternal example, and severally did the light to themselves. When this was done, together with the Marrow's dawn, the pagan attackers came on beholding the abbess and the sisters so outrageously mutilated and stained with their own blood from the sole of their foot unto their head, they retired in haste from the place. Their leaders ordered their wicked followers to set fire and burn the monastery with all its buildings and its holy inmates, which being done by these workers of iniquity, the holy abbess, and all the most holy virgins with her attained the glory of martyrdom.\n\nThere's a very graphic picture of St. Eba cutting her nose and lip off and all of the women around her looking thrilled at the concept. In terms of pain, it must have just been dreadful to cut your nose off at night and then wait until the morning with that pain racking your body. But that is the pain of martyrdom. It's the crown of thorns. I know it's hard to transpose oneself to a different time and place, but if you could put yourself back in a nunnery, do you think you would have followed suit and gone ahead and cut off your own nose despite your face?\n\nProbably.\n\nWhy?\n\nI think that there is a wave of hysteria that follows that kind of action where I don't think I would have been number two, but I probably would have been number 20. I mean, it's the happening thing, man. And we're all cutting our noses off right now. Why are we telling you this grizzly tale? Because the theme of today's show is spite, as in cutting off your nose to spite your face. Scholars aren't certain, but this phrase quite likely originates with the practice of Medieval Nuns like St. Eba, women who mutilated themselves in an attempt to preserve their chastity. Now, economics is all about tradeoffs. Everything has a cost and a benefit. What do you make of the nuns' tradeoff? Was it worth it?\n\n[Music]\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host, Stephen Dubner.\n\nOh,\n\n[Music]\n\ntoday's show is about spite. We're going to look at why people sometimes try to hurt others even when it's very costly to themselves. It struck me that spite is in some ways an economic concept. So, I called up the economist I know best, Steve Levitt. He's my Freakonomics friend and co-author and host of the podcast People I (Mostly) Admire.\n\nSo when I think about spite as an economist, the way I would think of spite is that it is the response of an individual who has been wronged in some way by another who then is willing in the future to pay a large cost in order to punish the person who wronged him in the first place. So in a strange sense, it's not a very economic concept because in general, we don't think that people are going to be overly willing to pay a lot of costs themselves to punish other people.\n\nYeah, I think what you described is more revenge than spite, though.\n\nAll right. So, I don't maybe I don't even know what spite is. What is spite?\n\nExcellent question. Well, it's not so easy indeed to define spite. And that's Benedict Herman. He is also an economist originally from Germany. Today he works as a research officer for the European Commission. He has done a lot of research on antisocial behavior. You might even call him a scholar of spite.\n\nLet's have an easy start here and define spite as a behavior where an individual is ready to harm him or herself at own cost to harm somebody else without creating anything good for a third party for anyone outside. Because you could sometimes be nasty to somebody just because he or she has misbehaved and you would like to do it in a kind of educational way which then I would not call spite because it's not costing you anything.\n\nNo. If I'm punishing somebody who has misbehaved to a community to our group if I punish him or her at own cost it could look like spite but it's not spite because it's an educational momentum. to try to get somebody who has done something bad to behave better in the future. So, it's a kind of a moralistic way of punishing, a moralistic way of being aggressive. And so, it's not the kind of spite I'm after. I'm after the kind of spite or kind of behavior where somebody would harm others for no reason, for no moral reason apart from something that might satisfy him or herself only.\n\n[Music]\n\nTraditional economics argues that most people try to satisfy their self-interest to maximize their profits and opportunities. Economists have a name for this model of self-interest, homoeconomicus.\n\nBut within that framework, spite is a bit puzzling. Why would someone pay outsized costs for no benefit other than to hurt someone else? Well, Benedict Herman thinks that the idea of homoeconomicus is a bit archaic. He prefers a different term.\n\nHomo rivales. Yes, indeed.\n\nHomo rivales, meaning that humans are driven at our core by competition rather than simple self-interest. Homoeconomicus wants to get as much as possible for himself. Homo rivalis just wants to make sure he gets more than the other guy. In other words, as much as we like to think that we are absolute animals, we are in fact relative animals. Now, we know this in part through the experimental games that economists like to play. One of the classics is called the ultimatum game. Here's Steve Levitt again. So, the ultimatum game is a little experimental game that the behavioral economists have developed in which two players come into the lab and they're completely anonymous. They'll never meet each other. It's a oneshot game. And one player is given, say, $10. And they're allowed to divide that $10 however they'd like between themselves and the other player. That other player is then informed about the way in which the division has occurred and is given a choice. They can either accept the division, say $7 for the person who's splitting the pot and $3 for me, or I have another option. We say, \"No, I prefer both of us to give zero.\" So you always face a choice between as the recipient of the ultimatum is I can accept what the other person offered me or I can have us both get zero. And empirically what we see is that rarely will anyone accept an offer that's less than 20%. So if the person who splits the pot divides it more unevenly than 75/25, you're almost guaranteed to have it rejected even though the rejector is giving up the 25 or the 20% of their own money in order to take the 75 or the 80% away from you.\n\nNow to an economist, this might seem perplexing. Why am I willing to throw away two or three of my dollars just to make sure that you don't get seven or eight? Well, maybe it's because I feel you've wronged me by splitting the pot so unevenly. But remember what Benedict Herman said earlier about spite. True spite, as he sees it, is not motivated by a desire to punish someone's bad behavior. So, he wanted to see how people behave absent such a moral incentive. He and a colleague came up with an experiment.\n\nSo let me quickly try to explain here on the radio how this experiment work. So you would be invited to our experiment like many other students. You don't know each other. You come to our lab inside. You have to sit behind computers. You are requested not to talk with anyone during the whole experiment. So you're paired with another player, but you don't see that person. You each get $10 and then you're given an option. If you surrender $1 of your money, you can destroy $5 of the other person's wealth. Now, there's no revenge going on here. There wouldn't seem to be anything for you to gain by destroying the other person's money. But as Benedict Herman found, about 10% of the players did take that option. Herman calls such a player a difference maximizer. That means that we want to maximize the payoff differential between the opponent and us. So maybe in a more ptoque way being aware that we are losing our trousers for the sake and for the hope that the opponent will lose both the shirt and the trousers.\n\nIn other words, some people were always willing to cut off their noses to spite the other player. Herman was perplexed by this finding and he tried the experiment in a variety of versions, variety of settings, different parts of the world, different kinds of societies. But in each case, he found that a surprising number of people would give up some of what was theirs for the sole purpose of taking something away from someone else.\n\n[Music]\n\nAnd what are you as the researcher thinking? Are you thinking this is remarkably surprising, sad, strange, irrational? What is your I mean on the one hand you must be excited because for the sake of a paper it's a fascinating finding. This exactly these are the two souls of a researcher. Of course on the one side exactly as you this said it very nicely you are very excited but on the other side of course you start thinking oh my god who the heck are we? We the humans for me the outcome of all this research is definitely a kind of sadness and also worry that we can be too fast we humans we can get too fast into intergroup conflict which don't make any sense to anyone that we start to harm each other that we start innocent people to kill each other for something that of the end of the day could have been decided in a much more reasonable\n\nNow, as interesting as this may be, as believable as it may be, Steve Levitt warns us not to make too much of lab experiments like these, it's hard to extrapolate from a lab setting to the hurly burly of the real world. When people are in the lab, they're completely anonymous. It's the only time we'll ever play. But the real world isn't usually like that.\n\nIndeed. So after the break, we'll get back to the real world. See if we can find a story where someone willingly gives up money and not just a few bucks like in these lab games, but lots and lots of bucks in order to prove a point. Well, the contract he was offered was 5 years, $7.66 million.\n\nThat's coming up after the break. I'm Stephen Dubner, and you are listening to a bonus episode of Freakonomics Radio from 2013. We'll be right back.\n\n[Music]\n\nDave Okconor is a longtime TV and film producer who's now president of Time Studios. Years ago, he executive produced a documentary film for ESPN called You Don't Know Bo. Bo as in Bo Jackson. Hey, he's remarkable. And look at that one. Bo Jackson says hello. He's just so quick. Look at that purse.\n\nJackson backs and he makes the catch. Nobody catches B. The answer is no. Bo has a B on the charge. Bo is there. Bo knows exactly what he's doing. Spider-Man.\n\nBo was probably the single greatest athlete of his generation. two sports star, football and baseball, and was just a transformative athlete. He just physically there's something about his presence that feels different than normal human beings.\n\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane? It's Super Bowl.\n\nIn the spring of 1986, Bo Jackson was playing his senior year of college baseball at Auburn. He showed signs of being a very highly valued Major League Baseball player. I'm carrying a cover off the ball. I'm batting over 400.\n\nOh, I don't know how many home runs I was sitting on then.\n\nThat's Jackson himself from the film. Now, he had just completed his senior season of college football, which had gone even better. Dave Okconor again.\n\nFootball his senior year is one of the all-time great seasons of a running back in college football. He rushes for nearly 1,800 yards. He wins the Heisman Trophy and basically enshrines himself as a legend of college football. Sort of the common wisdom was that Bo will be the number one draft pick in football. He will probably not play baseball at all. And if he does, somebody should pick him in the 20th round or 30th round on a flyer just in case, right? You don't want to waste a pick on a guy who's going to be playing football, right? So, while finishing up his college baseball career, Jackson starts getting courted by NFL teams. The football draft happens before the baseball draft. The number one overall NFL pick is held by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who are owned by a man named Hugh Culverhouse. The Bucks have made it clear that they want Bo Jackson.\n\nI was all gung-ho and I had taken a few trips to visit some teams my senior year. I got the okay to go visit Tampa Bay. Hugh Coverhouse sent his jet to Columbus airport, drove over, got on the jet, went to Tampa Bay for my visit. It was almost like a college visit when you're a high school senior and you going to visit a\n\n\nCollege and they get some of the players to show you around town, to show you the night spots, take you to a nice restaurant, and entertain you. About four or five days later, I'm back at Auburn getting ready for my baseball game. And I walked out on the field, I have to walk from the athletic department across the parking lot, across the street to the baseball field. And as I get to the gate to come around the dugout, Coach Bear approaches me. He said, \"Bo, can I talk to you for a second?\" I said, \"Sure, coach.\" He said, \"Let's go. We're behind the dugout. Let's go sit and talk.\" So, we go behind the dugout. And I'm thinking that he's going to tell me, \"Hey, some big league team wants to sign me.\" And um he said, \"Did you take a trip last week on Hugh Coverous's jet to go down to visit Tampa?\" I said, \"Yes.\" And the folks checked and said that it was okay. They checked with the NCAA and said that it was okay to do that. He said, \"Well, Bo, somebody didn't check and the NCAA has declared you ineligible for any more college sports, so you can't play baseball no more.\" And I sit there on that ground and I cried like a baby.\nI cried like a baby.\n[Music]\nBo Jackson immediately felt that he'd been wronged.\nHe loved baseball and even though it looked like he was going to play football professionally, he was distraught about being barred from finishing out his college baseball career. And what's more, he became convinced that Hugh Culver House, the Tampa Bay owner, had done this to Bo on purpose because the officials at Tampa Bay told me personally, \"Yes, we checked and they said that it was okay. I think it was all a plot now just to get me ineligible from baseball because they saw the season that I was having and they thought that they were going to lose me to baseball and if we declare him ineligible then we got it.\nNow, we don't know whether the Bucks actually meant for this to happen, but it certainly did seem to work out well for them. They were in line to pick Bo Jackson number one in the NFL draft and pay him so much money that he'd forget about baseball in a heartbeat. It was just one problem. Bo Jackson isn't the forgetting type.\nAnd I said, \"There is no way I'm signing with Tampa Bay.\" And I told Hugh Cobberhouse, I said, \"You draft me if you want. You going to waste a draft pick.\" I said, \"I promise you that.\" And Hugh Cobber House, well, this is what I'm gonna offer you as a signing bonus, and you're going to take it whether you want it or not. I said, \"All right.\" They didn't think I was serious.\nAnd I sat down after baseball season was over. I talked to my baseball coach. I said, \"Coach, a lot of people don't think I'm serious about playing baseball.\" I said, \"But if Tampa Bay drafts me,\" I said, \"On my honor and I'm looking you in your eye, manto man, I'm playing baseball.\" So if you know any teams out there that's interested in an outfielder, you let them know.\nIn the NFL draft that April, Tampa Bay did select Bo Jackson with the number one pick, which was attached to a $7.66 million 5-year contract. And then a couple of months later, Bo Jackson was selected in the baseball draft in the fourth round by the Kansas City Royals. They offered him three years at just $1 million. The choice would seem obvious, but Bo doesn't know obvious. He rejects a football offer and he takes the baseball offer. How surprising is this?\nHere's Dave Okconor again.\nUnprecedented. It just doesn't happen. You can't I mean, money talks, right? I mean, you have $7.6 million sitting there and you sign a contract for one. That's a rare occurrence.\nIt sounds like a decision that very few people that I know at least would have made. Do you think that was an act of spite on Bo Jackson's part?\nIt's interesting because I think Bo would say that he did the honorable thing and that he has a code, but when you look at it on its surface, it is spite. There is no rational explanation for walking away from that kind of money. He's not just hurting himself here. He's also doing this to hurt Tampa Bay to some extent. The opportunity cost of losing a first round draft pick isn't just that Bo Jackson isn't playing on my team. It's that every other player I could have selected with that pick is not playing on my team either. So, it's a huge impact to Tampa Bay. Not to mention the public relations nightmare of of going out on a limb and selecting somebody and not getting him.\nSo, Jackson does sign with the Royals. He starts the year in the minor leagues, but by the end of the season, he makes a major league team. He's on track for a nice baseball career, and then the next year, he becomes eligible to reenter football. Now, will he play? Nobody knows, but the Los Angeles Raiders draft him in the seventh round. He signs and suddenly he's playing two professional sports. At the end of the baseball season, he jumped straight into football and he became a star in both. He also becomes a household name. In part because of his athletic feats and in part because he was the star of one of the most beguiling ad campaigns in history. Bo knows for Nike.\nBo knows baseball. Bo knows football. Bo knows basketball, too.\nBo could surf. Bo could rollerblade. Bo could not play ice hockey. That was the one thing that they couldn't they couldn't agree to let him actually be able to do. Gretzky shakes his head and says, \"No.\"\nBut pretty much everything else, volleyball, tennis, running, lifting weights, aerobics, all kinds of stuff.\nYou don't know did.\nAll right. So, we agree that Bo Jackson's athletic career turned out pretty well. remarkable on some dimensions, but overall not one of the greatest ever because it wasn't long enough perhaps. We agreed that because he was such an unusual athlete into sports, he became this icon and the focus of a remarkable and probably quite remunerative ad campaign, right? We agree on this so far. Do we therefore agree that had this catastrophe not happened with him with getting drafted for the NFL by a team that out of spite or something like spite he turned down that if that had not happened that all the rests may not have happened. Yeah, I think that's a plausible argument to make because he probably had he signed that deal with Tampa Bay, if he doesn't get injured, he probably becomes one of the best running backs in NFL history. But that's probably it.\nI mean, honestly, my takeaway lesson here is spite pays.\nYeah, you would say. I mean, if you take a look at where he ends up, Spite certainly paid in his case.\nSo, here's a question worth thinking about. If spite indeed exists, is it something that we humans have always carried around in our genetic code, or do we pick it up along the way?\nWe are constantly wrestling with our conscience and with a tendency to deviate from social norms in a risky way and to do wrong, to be selfish.\nThat's coming up after the break. I'm Steven Dubner and this is Freakonomics Radio.\nSo far in this episode, we've heard about spite in professional sports, spite in medieval nuns, spite as measured in laboratory experiments. So, is spite an innate part of being human or is it something we learn?\nWe're a very biological organism and we've inherited an awful lot. In fact, most of the basic emotions that guide us from our animal and paleolithic early human past.\nThat is E.O. Wilson. He's a renowned biologist and author.\nAnd that's Katherine Wells. She produced this episode and she interviewed E.O. Wilson for us back in 2013.\nI called him up because I wanted to know where all of this self-destructive spite comes from.\nYou know, is this a common behavior throughout nature or are we unusual in it? And I have to say that I just assumed that we would be the meanest creatures in existence given everything we've heard today. But Wilson said that wasn't true.\nOh no, we only moderately mean. Now, E.O. Wilson has done a lot of thinking about the origins of human behavior, and he thinks the nastiness that we see in animals might give us a clue to why we act the way we do.\nThere's a case that comes quickly to mind, for example, of a kind of spider in which the mother has a brood of spiderlings and when they're born, she sits down and and lets the little spiderlings eat her. And there are a couple of cases in the ants where the workers have a huge gland of poisonous material containing it. And when they get into a tough fight, they are able to contract their abdomen and explode their abdomen so that the sticky poison covers the enemy. It can disable several enemies doing that by giving its life.\nThe list of this kind of behavior goes on and on. I mean, things that you really don't want to think about too much before you go to sleep. You might have nightmares. But here's the story about spite.\nIf we define spite as doing harm to someone else at the cost of harm to yourself and that involves a surrender of some advantage or emotional reward on your part, you give it up in order to hurt somebody else that might not exist in nature. Uh it's very difficult to find any case in the great encyclopedia of animal aggression where it doesn't give some advantage to the individual doing the aggression. But it's very rare that an animal would deliberately injure itself just in order to create injury in another individual without any further gain to itself. to deliberately do that.\nI think spite does not exist in the animal kingdom in the way that it does in humans. Is that right?\nWell, let's take humans. When a person injures himself or herself, say in reputation, in diminishing wealth, causing their own early death, whatever it is, in order to harm another person, you would say, \"Oh, that's spite. That's got to be spite.\" But it really would be true spite in my mind as opposed to mere risktaking or tradeoff for one kind of gain in exchange for one kind of loss taken if you can't see a gain. And that's hard to imagine. Even vengeance has its gain. It has a strong emotional award to it. For example, if you harm yourself in your reputation, you accept that if the damage you can do benefits you in some other way or benefits, say particularly your own offspring in a particular way. You know, like unscrupulous stage moms, murderouses of cheerleading champion competitors. I think you get the drift.\nEven a mass murderer who goes out and harms a lot of people is taking some benefit, emotional benefit from that when suicide is intended. A lot of mass murders are just a terrible form of suicide in which a person decides to get the satisfaction as vast of committing it. and maybe the satisfaction the person will get in striking out against something they imagine to be their enemy and diminish them before. So when you add that factor maybe real spite does not exist.\n[Music]\nSo I don't know whether this is a relief or not. I mean, the idea that spite might not even exist seems good. But the fact that we get personal satisfaction out of hurting other people, I told Wilson that was kind of a bummer.\nThat just shows you're not a psychopath.\nI'm I'm a total wuss.\nBut here's the upside. Spite is not the only motivation we have for being self-destructive. There's actually another altruism. When we hurt ourselves, we aren't always doing it just to hurt someone else. Sometimes we're doing it to help.\nOne of the things that makes us human is our internally conflicted nature, confliction, our ambivalence to our own selves. We are constantly wrestling with our conscience and with a tendency to deviate from social norms in a risky way and to do wrong to be selfish.\nThe contest within us between doing the moral thing even the heroic thing on one side and doing the selfish perhaps even criminal thing on the other side. That contest is what gives us such a continuously conflicted nature. If we became completely altruistic, then we would be like ants. If we went to the opposite extreme and had complete lack of constraint and it was complete individualism, then we would have chaos. We would not have order. The group would dissolve.\nSo, we have to be in the middle. This appears to be the human condition. It's funny listening to him talk about that.\nThat's Steve Levit again. He took a class with Wilson when he Levit was an undergrad at Harvard. He's very fond of the way Wilson thinks.\nThere could be no two disciplines closer than evolutionary biology and economics and they study different questions and they use different methods. But the way that evolutionary biologists think is exactly like the way that economists think. Both are very much a model of behavior of individual behavior and individual behavior that's motivated by costs and benefits. The other thing is that at its heart both economics and evolutionary biology strive for simplicity. That the simplest story which can explain a set of facts is the one that we gravitate to as opposed to other disciplines.\nHistory, history is all about complexity. Literature is all about complexity. Even sociology I think at heart is about complexity but economics is about simplicity.\nLike E.O. Wilson, Levit thinks that spite, true spite, may not really exist because that would mean that I hurt you even though I get nothing for it. Nothing.\nAnd while it may seem that I get nothing, I probably get something. What I would say about spite det, I would say this to know that an act is spite, you have to be inside the head of the perpetrator because the idea of spite is that it's being done without benefit. But it's interesting because one of the first premises of economics is you can never really know what other people are thinking and why they're doing what they're doing. Instead we focus on what they do. And so consequently, my view is forget about what's going on inside of other people's heads. You'll probably never know what it is and focus on what they're actually doing.\nDo you see altruism as sort of the flip side of the coin to spite and therefore not quite real? Altruism is exactly the flip side of spite in the sense that there are acts which very well could be\n\n\nAltruistic, but equally could be done in a perfectly self-interested way.\nBoth make you feel really good, and it feels good to help other people sometimes, and it feels so good to punish other people who've wronged you.\nSo I think they're both actually completely consistent with the idea of people doing the best they can.\n\nAnd what about you personally, Levit?\nDo you get more satisfaction generally from helping people or punishing people?\n\nI'm a lover, not a fighter.\nYou know that, don't you?\nI like to help people.\n\n[Music]\n\nI'd like to thank Steve Levit and everyone else for helping us think about spite today.\nI'm sorry to say that Liy Oliver died in 2015 at age 63 and IO Wilson died in 2021 at 92.\nWe will be back soon with a new episode.\nUntil then, take care of yourself and if you can, someone else too.\nFreakonomics Radio is produced by Stitcher and Renbud Radio.\nThis episode was originally produced by Katherine Wells and was updated by Dalvin Abuaji.\nIt was mixed by Jasmine Clinger.\nThe Freakonomics Radio Network staff also includes Alina Coleman, Augusta Chapman, Eleanor Osborne, Ellen Frankman, Elsa Hernandez, Gabriel Roth, Greg Ripen, Jeremy Johnston, Morgan Levy, Sarah Lily, Teao Jacobs, and Zack Leinsky.\nYou can find our entire archive on any podcast app or at freconomics.com, where we also publish transcripts and show notes.\nOur theme song is Mr. Fortune by The Hitchhikers.\nOur composer is Luis Gara.\nAs always, thank you for listening.\n\nSo to cut off my nose and to prevent rape by the Vikings, you said they were in this case.\n\nUh, no.\nIn this case, they're Sarissens.\nI have Viking examples I can give you.\n\nI bet you do.\nThe Freconomics Radio Network, the hidden side of everything.\n\n[Music]\n\nStitcher.\n",
