  "cleanText": "So, you got your PhD in economics from Harvard. I know that you and your husband have eight children, and you are stepmom to six more children from your husband's first marriage. I'm guessing there are not many other Harvard-educated economists who have 14 children. I don't know of any. Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but I don't know of any.\n\nKatherine Pollik is an economics professor at the Catholic University of America. I asked about her main areas of research: education, schools, fertility, and family formation.\n\nAnd what would you say you bring to those topics that the median economists might not bring?\n\nI think I bring to the table a large number of things that are outside of the field. And you know, of course, I'd be disingenuous if I didn't add that we'll have a lot of kids. And so that makes you think about things a little bit differently.\n\nYou might say that a lot of people have started to think differently about fertility and family formation. For decades, the great fear among demographers and politicians and environmentalists was overpopulation. They argued that the Earth's resources simply couldn't support 3 billion people, certainly not 5 billion or 8 billion, which is where we stand today. That fear hasn't totally gone away, but it has been joined by a fear of the opposite, that there are now too few babies being born.\n\nHere's an astonishing fact. The global fertility rate has fallen by more than half over the past 50 years. Why? The answer to that question is complicated, and any solution is even more so. Today on Freakonomics Radio, we began a three-part series about the great arc of human life. The inspiration for this series was a famous painting by Gustav Climpt called Death and Life. It shows a healthy newborn lying serenely on a bed of flowers among a group of adults, most of them young women. But there, off to the side, is death, a grim reaper smiling over this peaceful scene, knowing that he will win out in the end. That's the thing. Life is finite, and life is precious.\n\nDoes our knowing that it's finite make it even more precious? That's a deep question, one we probably won't be able to answer during this series, but it will surely be hovering over every minute. Our three-part series, Cradle to Grave, starts now.\n\n[Music]\n\nThis is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything with your host, Stephen J. Dubner.\n\n[Music]\n\nDonald Trump has declared himself the fertilization president, and he wants Americans to have more babies. Why?\n\nLet's start with what's called the total fertility rate. That's the expected number of births that a woman would have over her lifetime. In the first half of the 19th century, the US fertility rate was over six babies per woman. In the late 1950s, it was 3.7. Today it's at 1.6 babies per woman, a record low. That also puts us well below the so-called replacement rate of 2.1. That's the number needed to keep a population steady. So, the Trump administration has proposed a variety of policies: a $5,000 baby bonus, federally funded fertility education programs, even a national medal of motherhood for women who have six or more children. Katherine Pollik would certainly be eligible for that medal. She had six of her eight biological children while she was in graduate school. The oldest is now 25.\n\nShe has found that people make assumptions about women with a lot of children. The first assumption, which is pretty common, is that it's somehow a less than rational choice, that you do this maybe for cultlike reasons because somebody says that you should or a religious leader says that you should, especially as somebody whose professional life is devoted to introspection and clear thinking and understanding, especially as an economist, the nature of rationality, that feels really painful. You fear that it may look to your colleagues as if the choice to have children is in some way revealing a lack of seriousness about your work. I want to be very clear. Most of what I'm telling you is in my head. I'm not accusing anybody of having been less than supportive or negative in any way. But the concern is you think that your colleagues will think you're not as capable.\n\nWe should say there are plenty of male economists who do manage to have a good number of children while they're building their careers. Yeah. If you're raising the question of the difference between men and women having children in academia, we know that getting married and having children there isn't the productivity penalty and in fact maybe a little gain. But for women, of course, time is a rival good, right? When people say children are expensive, they're not wrong, but they aren't used to using the language economists use; they're expensive in terms of opportunity cost or lifestyle cost. If the only fun thing you could do 40 years ago on your weekends with the amount of income you had relative to the purchasing power that you have is the only fun thing you could do is stay home and watch TV and drink beer, well, maybe having a kid is not really a big problem for you. But if the thing you can do now is you could travel, for instance, way more accessible for so many more people all around the world, well, that next kid is going to completely change. That's a real cost.\n\n40 years ago, fewer than 3% of US citizens even owned a passport. Today, it's around 50%. So, yes, a lot of things have changed. A lot of opportunities have arisen. As she was thinking about big picture fertility, Pakalik realized it would be useful to consider not just those smaller families but also outliers like herself, people who are still having a lot of kids. Do they believe different things? Have they made different choices? Do they have a different value structure? What does that look like?\n\nSo I began traveling around the country to speak with women in a variety of communities who have larger than normal-sized families to find out why they're doing this and what they think it means for themselves and for their families. Pullik and her research team interviewed 55 women across the country, all of whom have five or more children. The research project became a book that Pollik published in 2024 called Hannah's Children, the women quietly defying the birth d. The biblical Hannah is probably the single most known character in the world who represents someone who really wanted a child.\n\nYour book is a qualitative study, but it's not a quantitative study. Plainly, if we're talking about big population statistical analysis, this is just a drop in the bucket. Why did you go that route?\n\nWe really do have a lot of great large population data about what's happening with birth rates in general. What we're missing are some of the nitty-gritty about the theory. So, that's where you turn in social sciences to qualitative work when you're trying to struggle with the theory.\n\nAll the women she interviewed have college degrees and all are religious. They don't see wanting children as a choice of a plan or control in the way that I think most people think about planning their families. There's a very specific content to wanting children which has to do with cooperation with God's providence.\n\nI think people who think you can't have too many children are particularly interesting. Children are this sort of substantive good, but they probably don't obey the same laws of economic preferences where most normal goods you eventually get satisfied by them or we say diminishing returns. One thing this makes me think of is really I think an often unobserved or maybe even unobservable idea which is what is the utility to the children who were born in a big family who wouldn't have been born if it was a smaller or average-sized family. And in this regard I point to myself. I'm the youngest of eight.\n\nI believe you were one of nine siblings. Is that right?\n\nYes. I'm the oldest of nine.\n\nSo I would have made it. You would have made it.\n\nBut I keep thinking you would not have made it. Yeah. If my family hadn't decided for some rather strange set of reasons to have eight children, I wouldn't be around to complain about, you know, anything much less a pine on proper family size. When I was having my children, it gave me some special pleasure to think about, you know, having my fifth. I would think, okay, which of my siblings is my fifth? And that's my brother Ed. He's such a good friend of mine, and Ed's great. So then when you think like are we done trying to have children and you think to yourself well maybe there would be a little bit of a loss and thinking there isn't going to be that last child.\n\nOne memory I have of the biblical Hannah is that, you know, this is back when prayer was not common or normalized in the Jewish tradition, but that Hannah did pray very, very intensely to God to be able to have a child, which she hadn't been able to. And that her prayer was so intense that people thought she was crazy.\n\nYes. And that strikes me as a perhaps unintentionally appropriate parallel between the biblical Hannah and modern Hannah's who are considered like I mean I didn't plan to ask you this question this directly because it sounds quite rude but have people from your friend groups, professional groups, your own extended family etc. thought that you were a little bit crazy for wanting so badly to have so many children?\n\nYeah, people just don't know what to make of it. The most polite version is something like, why, you know, why would you do this? Sometimes there's less polite versions of it. For instance, don't you know how this happens? Oh my gosh. Right? People say these things when they see a group of little kids and they think, \"Oh no, they're not all yours.\"\n\nMost of us who get asked these questions, you come up with something kind of funny. But in fact, there's not an easy way to answer why would you do this? But you feel this is your servitude essentially.\n\nYes. Mhm.\n\nWould you say to a stranger, I believe that God wants me to have a lot of children?\n\nI might say it. It would depend on the context of the conversation. I might revert to I think it's great. It's a substantive good. Having children is wonderful. I sometimes say, \"I enjoyed my first one so much I wanted another one and kept going.\"\n\nIs it fair to call you an advocate of or a promoter of higher fertility in general?\n\nI'm only an advocate in so far as I'm happy to talk about my own personal experience, but I'm a really strong believer that the household is the correct locust of decision-making and that only an individual household can correctly assess the costs and benefits to them. I also think it's the only locust that is workable in a non tyrannical society or free society, we'll say.\n\nWhen Katherine Pakalik says that only an individual household can assess the costs and benefits of having children, I'm guessing most of us can appreciate that sentiment. But I'm guessing we also appreciate that a steep drop in fertility across a society does have consequences. Matias Dupka certainly does.\n\nHow many children we have and what we do with our families are in many ways the most important decisions in our life both at a personal level but also for the economy. Dupka is a German-born economist who teaches at the London School of Economics. I'm trained originally as a macroeconomist, but in fact, most of my work touches on family economics. He also co-wrote a book called Love, Money, and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way Wea, and he has three children, if you're wondering.\n\nEconomists like Dupka and Pakalik didn't used to do research on things like family formation, but that changed with Gary Becker. He was a more holistic thinker than most economists of his era. Becker got his PhD in 1955, won a Nobel Prize in 1992 and died in 2014. And he liked to blend in ideas from sociology and criminology. When Matias Dupka got his PhD at the University of Chicago, he studied under Gary Becker. For Gary Becker, economics is just a way to think about how people make decisions. And you can apply that method to everything: who you marry, how many children you have, how you educate your children; all of those are decisions that can be analyzed with the tools of economics.\n\nWhy as an economist is fertility and family formation such an important topic?\n\nIf you think for example of economic growth, it depends on population growth. How many people there are of course is relevant for economic prospects. If an economy is shrinking in population, it will also shrink in economic output. There's also important decisions on education, on human capital more widely that are done inside families which matter a lot for how the economy does in the long term.\n\nEconomists have many phrases to describe many things that normal people don't need. You have a lot of jargon. When I hear you talk about children, my mind goes to some of the categorizations that economists use to describe things like normal goods, inferior goods, and luxury goods. Where do children fall in there?\n\nThat was the first fundamental question in the economics of fertility because the first observation in the data that Gary Becker had to deal with when he started with this whole enterprise was that it used to be the case that richer people have fewer children. So there was large families among the poorer households, smaller families among the richer households. And that was true everywhere across countries. Also over time, you know, as countries get richer, they have fewer children. If you just think of children as consumption goods, which maybe you shouldn't, but if you wanted to do that, you would have to say that sounds like children are an inferior good. It's an example of the kind of goods that you want less of as you get richer. With children, it's not quite like that. When you get richer, instead of having a child, you have a very fancy dog or something like that. is not the mechanism that's going on. So something else has to be going on. Gary Becker tried to explain this pattern even though rich people otherwise have more of everything. And his idea was that having children involves both deciding how many to have and how much to invest in them. Something that he refers to as child quality.\n\n[Music]\n\nOkay. If you were starting to worry that Gary Becker wasn't quite a real economist, you can stop worrying now that we're talking about child quality and how much to invest in children. And there's plenty of evidence that Becker's framework was correct. High-income countries like Japan and South Korea and Spain have fertility rates well below the replacement level. What has changed since Becker's time is that many countries that are not wealthy like Albania and Nepal and El Salvador are also below the replacement level. What was initially something done only by higher income parents is now done by almost everybody. And so while the quantity quality choice is still there, it's perhaps not what's driving most of the variation that we're seeing today.\n\nOkay. So what has been driving lower\n\n\nFertility rates? One obvious answer,\nobvious at least to an economist, is the\nfact that millions upon millions of\nwomen have been entering the workforce.\nWe had a model of a clear gender\nseparation of labor a generation ago\nwhere many women were homemakers or\nwould interrupt their careers for long\nperiods. We are in a different phase now\nwhere young women and men have very\nsimilar aspirations. Most mothers are\nworking, fathers are working, and that\ncreates a tension that we haven't fully\nresolved yet. It's difficult to have two\njobs and three or four children. So many\npeople stop a bit earlier. The other\nthing that has happened is how we raise\nour children has changed. The nature of\nparenting is now quite different. We see\nin all the high-income countries that\nparents spend a lot more time on\nparenting than they did a generation\nago. The effort required has gone up to\nsome extent for cultural reasons, but\nmostly I would argue for economic\nreasons, namely that parents perceive\nperhaps correctly that the stakes have\nrisen in raising their children. This\nrelates to what Gary Becker used to call\nchild quality. A more modern phrase is\nintensive parenting. Intensity is a good\nword for it. How do you think about that\nas an economist? Is that just what you'd\ncall a personal preference? I think it's\nnot a personal preference at all. This\nis something that I've worked on a lot\nwith my co-author Fabit Suzili. What we\nargue is that parents are really\nresponding to a changed environment just\nlike we respond as consumers to changes\nin incentives. A big part of that is\nrising inequality and rising stakes in\neducation. Why do American parents care\nso much about making sure their kids do\nwell in high school and pass the math\nexam? Because now college education is\nsuper important. When I was little, it\nwasn't like that. You could go to\nuniversity, you could go to an\napprenticeship. The inequality was quite\nlow. There were very different paths you\ncould take and have an equally\nsuccessful life as an adult. So parental\nintensity as you're describing it takes\na lot of time and money and other\nresources. How much does parental\nintensity drive lower fertility? I think\nit's an important aspect. We now have\nsome countries with ultra low fertility\nrates, sometimes below one child per\nwoman. Those are also the countries with\nthe most intensive parenting culture.\nFamously, South Korea has now about 0.7\nchildren per woman, which means each\ncohort is less than half the size of the\nprevious one. How much does access to\nand cost of childcare impact fertility\nrates? It impacted a lot. If you look at\nvariation in fertility across higher\nincome countries, that's one of the\nclosest correlations you're going to\nsee. There's a lot of variation across\nthese high-income countries in what\nthey spend on childcare between a half%\nof GDP at the lowest end to maybe 3%. So\nsix times more at the upper end, and this\ndoes correlate quite closely with\nfertility. And when you say what they\nspend, does that mean what government\nspends? What government spends? Yes. But\nthen you have a place like the US where\nthe government spends very little on\nchild care, and yet our fertility rate,\nwhile it has fallen quite a lot, is still\nhigher than most of, let's say, western\nand northern Europe. Yes, the US is\nactually a very interesting case because\nindeed there is very little public\nsupport for childcare. There's also very\nlittle in terms of policies for parental\nleave and things like that. One thing\nthat also matters is social norms. Does\nsociety accept that mothers are working\nfull-time, for example? On that\ndimension, the US is doing very well.\nEverybody thinks that's a normal way to\nlive your life. The other thing that\nmasked some of these issues in the past\nis that the US used to have a very high\nteenage fertility rate, and that made the\noverall numbers look fairly high. Now in\nthe last few years, the teenage fertility\nhas fallen, which is probably a good\nthing because many of those babies were\naccidental pregnancies. I would think\nanother big driver of fertility choices\nis access to and cost of housing. What\ncan you tell us about that? That is\nsomething that should be examined more\nempirically, but certainly the data is\nvery suggestive of this being important.\nSome of the lowest fertility places\nthere are also very high housing cost\nplaces. South Korea is one example.\nThese city states, Hong Kong, Singapore,\nhave extremely low fertility rates and\nextremely high housing costs. What about\ncost of education, especially higher\neducation? So in the US, we have\nessentially free education K through 12,\nbut then college generally not free.\nOther countries do things differently,\nbut here if you're deciding between\nlet's say two and three children, one\nchild at current prices of college four\nyears could cost anywhere from $100,000\nto $500,000. So what do we know about\nthe relationship there as a driver of\nlower fertility? Yes, we again don't\nknow anything definitive because we\ndon't have experiments. Matias, you\npeople need to get to work. What have\nyou been doing this whole time? It is\ndifficult because these are decisions\nyou can't do in the lab. Many things you\ncan do experiments on and just see how\npeople react with fertility. It's\ndifficult to do. So, Majas, the longer\nwe talk, the more my mind gets scrambled\nin a very pleasant way, I have to say,\nbecause we read headlines about falling\nfertility and how horrible that is. The\ngeneral economic argument is that we\nneed more workers, we need younger\npeople to take care of older people, we\nneed economic growth and so on. But as\nyou're describing the way fertility and\nfamily formation have actually happened\naround the world and why what people are\nresponding to, to me it sounds like a\nmostly good story. If most families are\nhaving fewer children because they want\nto invest more in those children in\nterms of education and dollars. They\nwant to spend more time with their\nchildren. They want to give their\nchildren maybe more opportunities, more\nlove perhaps, more modeling of what a\nlife looks like. I could imagine\nspinning this problem around and looking\nat it as a potentially wonderful\ndevelopment in the history of\ncivilization. Would you agree with that\nor not quite? Am I being too polyianish\nthere? I would completely agree with you\nlooking at the past. If you think about\nthe decline from six children to two in\nthe United States and the same thing\nhappening in every country that's now\nrich, it has been a fantastic thing.\nJust as you say, it was because of this\nrise of mass education. We were a mostly\nilliterate society in 1850. Now\neverybody goes to at least high school.\nMany kids go on to college and therefore\nhave much higher earnings. It's a good\nthing for the economy. It's probably\nalso a good thing for relationships of\nparents and children spending more time\ntogether. Another aspect is what we call\nthe demographic dividend. There's this\nbig change in the age structure of the\npopulation. When you do this one-time\nchange from high to low population\ngrowth, you get these 30, 40 years of a\nvery large labor force because there's\nstill many people entering the labor\nforce with few people to support because\nthere's still a small number of old\npeople but also not many children\nanymore because fertility has fallen. And\nthis is a tremendous benefit. You saw\nthat a lot in the Asian tigers in South\nKorea and Taiwan. You saw it in China\nuntil very recently because now it's also\nan aging society. Okay, so that's the\ngood news. Let's have the bad news. When\nyou think about why fertility is falling\neven further now from two children to\none and a half per family on average or\neven less, it's not that this\nreflects even higher investment. It used\nto be in the past all about this\ntrade-off between having more\nchildren and educating them better or\nworse. Now it's no longer that. It's\njust other factors. And so this benefit\nfrom lower fertility is no longer there.\nAlso, now that fertility is ultra low,\nthere is new downsides coming into\nfocus, which is loss of labor force and\njust the shrinkage of the population,\nwhich you might be depressed about if\nyou just care about the survival of your\npeople, but also has different\nimplications on different people. When\npopulations start to shrink, it doesn't\nshrink everywhere equally. The big\ncities are still attractive, so people\nwill still live in New York and Chicago.\nI suppose the countryside empties out\nfirst. That's both very unequal in terms\nof who it affects and essentially\ncontributing to widening inequality in\nsociety. So what you just described\nmakes me acknowledge that the caution\nand sometimes even the panic that I read\nin the press about falling fertility is\nwarranted. On the other hand, when you\nlook at population predictions over the\npast 100 years or so, I mean I have a\nword to describe the quality of those\npredictions, but let me hear your word\nfirst. How good have the predictions of\npopulation generally been? They have\nbeen terrible.\nComing up after the break, since past\npredictions have been terrible, should\nwe stop trying to predict the future?\nCome on, where's the fun in that? I'm\nStephen Dubner. This is Freakonomics\nRadio. We'll be right back.\nIn case you're not old enough to\nremember when the world was losing its\nmind about overpopulation, here's a\ntaste. The main premise is that there's\n3.6 billion people in the world today\nand we're adding about 70 million a year\nand that's too many. That's Paul Erlich,\na Stanford biologist who in 1968\nco-wrote a book called The Population\nBomb. It's too many because we are\ngetting desperately short of food. We're\nvery much short of other resources, and\nthat above all the very delicate life\nsupport systems of the planet are now\nseverely threatened. Erlich was\nappearing on the Tonight Show with\nJohnny Carson. That's how mainstream his\nargument was. His most startling\nprediction was that in the very next\ndecade, the 1970s, hundreds of millions\nof people would die of starvation,\nincluding 65 million in the US. He wrote\nthat India was doomed and that England\nwill not exist in the year 2000. Erlich\ncertainly made valid points about the\nchallenges of a growing population, but\nmany of his predictions were\nspectacularly wrong. Still, scary\npredictions have a way of influencing\nbehavior and policy. In 1979, China\nannounced its one-child policy, which\nlasted until 2015. Here again is the\neconomist Matias Dupka. I do think that\nthe most direct implication of this fear\nof high population growth were\npopulation control policies, and those\nfor the most part I think were a\ncomplete human disaster. A complete\nhuman disaster because why? The one-child\npolicy in China, one of the biggest\nattempts of social engineering ever\nattempted. It had some positive economic\nbenefits in terms of income per capita,\nbut it was also such a drastic policy\nwith forced abortions. Massive\ninterventions in people's most basic\nchoices that was hard to have a very\npositive view about. And in India,\nfosterizations were widely used. So\nbecause we had a long-term trend towards\nlower fertility rates, and that started\nalmost 200 years ago, the forecasts were\nbased on extrapolating from that. And so\nthey did the right thing in saying that\nfertility will continue to decline along\nsome path. What they got wrong is how\nquickly that was going to happen. When\nAsian countries entered demographic\nchange after World War II, they did this\nmuch more rapidly than the US had done\npreviously. They were also wrong about\nwhere it was going to end up. For many\nyears, population forecasts were based\non the expectation that the long-term\nfertility would balance out at\nessentially two children per woman,\nwhich would keep the population\nconstant. There was really never much of\na basis for that expectation, and now we\nsee very clearly that fertility seems to\nbe headed much lower, which of course\nhas a big impact on future forecast for\nwhat population is going to be. So do you\nblame the demographers for getting the\npredictions so wrong? I don't know if\nit's really the fault of the\ndemographers because these things are\nhard to predict. You know the economic\nconditions have changed.\nThat's the thing about predictions,\nespecially predictions about something\nas complex as global population.\nSomething is always changing, and it's\nhard to factor that in. As Dupka says,\nthe global economy has changed a lot\nover the past several decades, arguably\nboth for better and worse. That's a much\nlonger conversation for another time.\nBut in terms of fertility, consider one\nsmall but interesting piece of evidence\nfrom the economic literature. The\nconventional wisdom used to be that\nfertility decisions are a result of\neconomic conditions. That boom times\nproduced more babies and bad times\nproduced fewer. In other words,\nfertility was a lagging economic\nindicator, not a leading indicator. But\na 2018 research paper that looked at the\n2008 global financial crisis found that\nfertility actually started dropping in\nthe months before the crisis hit. This\nsuggests, if nothing else, that\nfertility decisions may be more of a\nleading indicator than was previously\nthought. So economic uncertainty is\nsomething to think about. And when it\ncomes to making predictions in a realm\nas complicated as fertility with so many\nvariables and so many incentives, there\nis another area of uncertainty that\nmight surprise you. Considering how long\nwe humans have been making babies, it\nfeels unjust that we know so little\nabout how our reproductive system works\nand it's such an important part of human\nexistence. That is Diana Leair. I'm a\nprofessor at University of California,\nSan Francisco in the department of\nobstetrics and gynecology and in the\nstem cell program. UCSF has been for the\npast decade the top funded public\nacademic institution by the NIH, the\nNational Institutes of Health. My lab is\nreally interested in where our eggs come\nfrom developmentally speaking, how that\nprocess plays out, how it affects aging,\nand the 39 years in humans that we have\nfor our ovaries to actually work and\nmake babies. Those 39 years refer to the\naverage woman's fertility window between\npuberty and menopause. What we don't\nknow outweighs what we do know. It's\nfirst of all really difficult to capture\nthose early stages. We understand very\nlittle about how the embryo\nknows where to go and why in many\npatients there's repeated failure of\nimplantation of the embryo. Work with\nhuman embryos is not fundable by NIH\ndollars and actually with fertilized\nembryos is illegal in many states. So\nthat makes it very difficult to ask\nthose fundamental scientific questions.\nIf you are, let's say, a government\nhoping to slow down the fertility\ndecline or even reverse it, you'd think\nit would be useful to answer those\nfundamental scientific questions. One\nquestion has to do with a woman's\nlifetime supply of eggs. Egg cells\ndevelop in the female while she's still\na fetus. It's believed that she starts\nwith around 7 million eggs. By the time\nshe's born, she'll have 1 to two million\neggs. From there, her supply continues\nto diminish. And why is that? We don't\nreally know how these events in the\nearly development of the embryo connect\nto the number of eggs that we have\neventually. Lar likes to use an economic\nanalogy here. If I told you that you're\ngoing to have an inheritance of $7\nmillion,\nyou would probably be really happy. And\nif I said, \"Well, due to market\nconditions and volatility,\nby the time you're born, it's going to\nbe more like 1 million.\" You'd still\nprobably be like, \"Well, a million\ndollars is pretty good.\" But then if I\ntold you that, well, by the time you\nactually need this inheritance, it's\ngoing\n\n\nTo be closer to maybe three or 400,000.\nYou would think I was a really bad investor because, you know, the eggs are our inheritance. I guess I could make it worse, and I could tell you that by the time you use them, a lot of those dollars are not going to be accepted because they won't work. And there's even more uncertainty. Physicians and researchers can't accurately measure the number of eggs in a given woman's ovarian reserves, nor do current tests reveal anything about the quality of an egg while it's in a woman's body. How is it that a doctor can't actually tell you how many eggs you have if you're 20? How can you start to make plans about how you're going to live your life, how you're going to have a career, whether or not you're going to have children, and when that might happen? How can you make all those decisions if you don't even know how long you have to reproduce and if you'll be able to? I'm not saying that everyone needs to reproduce, but I think it should be a choice. It's a very human experience, and it's how we continue our species. Unfortunately, the research funds for understanding the basics of reproduction and fertility have been pretty meager. Indeed, researchers have found that NIH applications with the words fertility, ovary, and reproductive have the lowest rates of funding acceptance, much lower than keywords like protein or glaucoma or mRNA. It makes it a little bit less painful when I get grants rejected. It's not just me. In February, President Trump signed an executive order called expanding access to in vitro fertilization as part of his administration's push to boost fertility rates. But soon after, his administration eliminated the six-person team within the Department of Health and Human Services that tracks IVF. So, if scientific research isn't the way forward for a government that wants more babies, how about financial incentives? Coming up after the break. It was a decade-long experiment that really was considered unsuccessful. I'm Stephen J. Dubner. This is Freakonomics Radio. We'll be right back.\n\n[Music]\n\nIt might be tempting to think that fertility rates have only begun falling recently. One of the things that my work shows is that fertility rates have declined in other time periods and in other places. That's Amy Freud. I'm a professor of history at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Freud specializes in early modern Britain, women's economic history in particular. In the 1690s, England was in the midst of really the beginning of over a hundred years of wars against their enemies, the French. And there was a concern about being a strong and prosperous nation that could compete militarily and politically. And that meant growing their populations. Back then, fertility rates were very closely tied to marriage rates. In many places today, that connection is much looser. But King William III of England reckoned that boosting marriage would boost fertility. Enter the Marriage Duty Act of 1695. They began to tax bachelors over the age of 25 and widowers who were childless. Sometimes elite single women were taxed as well. Freud says this new tax was likely unpopular, as taxes tend to be, but did it work? We're not sure that we can prove that it raised marriage rates, and it also didn't raise enough money for the king in his wars. So, it was abandoned in the early 1700s. France, meanwhile, was also concerned about their fertility rates. But rather than offer a stick in the form of attacks, they offered a carrot. Louis the 14th passes an edict in promotion of marriage in the 1660s, which is even a little earlier than the concern about marriage in England. In this edict, he was willing to offer financial incentives to men who would marry by the age of 21, which was very young. Also financial incentives to men who fathered large families. As with the marriage tax in England, it's hard for historians like Freud to prove whether these incentives boosted fertility. What's interesting is that just a few decades later, both France and England started to study fertility itself. Both countries become much more concerned about what we today would call reproduction. In fact, that's an 18th-century term. Before that time, generation was usually the term, but there's a more scientific conceptualization of producing children that takes hold. Along with it is an encouragement of new technologies and new people that might be able to ensure that childbirth is more safe and more successful. In England at the time, as many as one in three babies were dying in childbirth or soon after. A 33% infant mortality rate is horrific. Right? There was a feeling that perhaps female midwives were not doing an adequate job. And over the 18th century, we see the introduction of the man midwife. The man midwife was a male who had been educated at a college or university and who was going to bring a more scientific approach to childbirth. And so men begin to push female midwives out of the business of childbirth. This starts at the apex of society. Women of the nobility and royal women begin to use male midwives. At the same time, they also embrace new technologies like the forceps, which are developed by the man midwife family, the Chamberlins. Side note here, the Chamberlain's family hoarded their invention for more than a century, not sharing it outside their well-born circle. This withholding of the forceps is thought to have cost millions of lives. In France, meanwhile, the midwife industry went in a different direction. Louis XV decides that he needs to train midwives better. And the person he chooses to do that is a woman. Her name was Madame Duare. Kudra was a Parisian midwife who received training and then was part of a regulated body of midwives. She had some of the highest earning power amongst Parisian midwives. And so the king sent her around the country to different cities and towns where she trained local female midwives in some of the up-to-date ways of delivering children that she had been taught in Paris. Madame Dudre promoted a different style of midwifery than the male midwives. Female midwives would argue they didn't need forceps because they could handle complicated births with their own hands. Cudray also felt that technology instead of being used in the birthing process should be used in the teaching process. She developed what she called her machine or her mannequin, which was a simulated pelvis of a woman with a cuchamance like a fetus and a placenta. She used different types of textiles and materials to try to simulate reality. She would have both hard and soft materials, perhaps leather, perhaps linen, different colored materials to indicate different parts of the anatomy. It shows her understanding of anatomy, her practical nature, her inventiveness. Kudra also published a midwife handbook with colored anatomical plates. It's hard to prove causality, but we do see in some areas that live births and successful live births were going up. There's a wonderful book by Nina Galbart called The King's Midwife where she argues that you could extrapolate the number of successful births based on Kudra's training and then the midwives who followed her training. That kind of thing can be hard to trace though for the 18th century. And one of the sad things is so many records were destroyed in the French Revolutionary period. If you go back to 18th-century England, meanwhile, it does seem like there was a fertility rebound as evidenced by new concerns about overpopulation. People began to discuss the idea of limiting population as a way to improve one's economy. England is often taken as the example of a country that did that early. That is associated with industrialization and the idea that perhaps not as many people are needed to work in the economy. And so it's interesting to me as a historian to see us returning to concerns about having enough workers. This is really an eternal question. How many people should be allowed or encouraged to exist in a given space and place? This question can quickly migrate into the political sphere, and from there it's a short step to government policy. Our era is not immune. This recent concern about too few babies, it can feel like whiplash after all those decades of concern about overpopulation. And of course, before that were more underpopulation worries and so on and so on and so forth. I wasn't kidding when I called it an eternal question, and it swings both ways. At the moment, governments in many countries are trying to boost their babyhood through tax benefits, better parental leave, cash bonuses, state-sponsored matchmaking apps, and much more. Will they work? Here again is the economist Matias Stupka. These are the biggest decisions we take in our lives. And you see in the data that people don't respond very strongly to short-run changes in policy, financial incentives. If you just give a bonus for having more children. No, people do respond. They don't respond very much. They are in many ways set in their ways, and you make a plan, and you will not change it like government by government. If you were secretary of higher fertility in Washington in a future time, what would be your best ideas societywide and not just perhaps around the time of birth, but what would be your biggest society, economywide ideas for providing the best situation to boost fertility? I think we want to imagine what kind of society will want people to have larger families and what are the things holding them back right now. We have mentioned many of them. One is this issue of compatibility of careers and having children. That has to do with making it easier for women to uh rejoin the labor force after they have children. More childcare provision. Another part that's also come into focus with the epidemic is this issue of flexibility of jobs. If you have a job but it's completely inflexible, meaning you have to be there 10 hours every day, you can never leave. Uh if for example a child has a fever or has a theater performance, that will also make it more difficult. So creating workplaces that are a bit more flexible for everybody will also make it easier for families to decide to have that additional child. I went back to Katherine Pakalik, the economist, mother of 14 and author of Hannah's children. I don't believe that policymakers ought to aim to influence household decision-making as regards children. The reason I say that is because those costs and benefits, the big ones, the ones that are really affecting our current situation, those are subjective and personal. Policy can't hit those things. Do you feel that that position aligns you with a particular political movement or even a name? I sometimes use the language of a pragmatic libertarian. Pragmatic in the sense that I'm not committed to the philosophical foundations of libertarianism. You write, \"The flourishing of traditional religious institutions breaks the low marriage, low fertility cycle. People will lay down their comfort, dreams, and selves for God, not for subsidies.\" Can you say a little bit more about that? Because as the global fertility rate falls, we're seeing more and more governments take all kinds of measures to try to boost births. As far as I can tell, most of these fail, or they might produce a short-term birth boom, but that seems to be just a timing thing that it's not actually encouraging people to have more children, just the timing. Can you talk about the ways in which, as you write it, government subsidies are weaker than internal or religious guidance? They're weaker because they just don't operate on the right margin. We're proud of the fact that women and girls spend 12 years in school minimally, we hope. But what happens in those 12 years of school is that we're preparing for certain kinds of professional work. That's the margin where the conflict between family and career is happening. It's not obvious to me that subsidies of the kind that we've been thinking about can really get into that margin and make that adjustment. Do we have to roll back women's education in order to see higher birth rates? I don't think the answer is yes. I think the answer is definitely no. But we have to ask questions about value formation and where those things come from. Why shouldn't I say, \"Hey, Katherine, I understand that you're making a particular religious/personal argument for the beauty of having more children.\" And I'm cool with that. 100% cool with that. On the other hand, I don't think we really need to be having a conversation about boosting a falling fertility rate because the future is probably nowhere near as grim as the doomsayers say. So, should people who are worried about low fertility rate, rather than trying to come up with government policies to boost birth policies that don't work, should we all just relax a little bit and let people do what they want to do? I'll put it this way. I do not think of my book and my work as an attempt to promote having children. My work is an attempt to help people understand what are the costs and benefits and how do households make these decisions. I'm attempting to show up in that conversation and say look that may be a policy decision that will have unintended perhaps negative consequences because I don't think you can encourage this. What's a policy with fewer unintended consequences? I like to think that religious liberty is a good policy decision for countries of any type at any point in time. Pluralism, religious tolerance, and devolving more of the human care in society to religious communities. So in a sense, I see this as a moment to say calm down, and if you want to do something, here's something that you can do which I think could never harm things and could only help.\nI have to say I only have two kids, but I like them so much I wish I had a couple more just like them. I get that there's limits, but I would certainly love to have a few more.\nThat again was Katherine Balik. Thanks to her, to Matias Dupka, Diana Leairard, Amy Freud, and thanks especially to you for listening. I hope you will spread the word about our show. That is the biggest thank you we could ask for. If you would rather complain, you can write directly to us at radio@freconomics.com. Coming up next time, part two in our Cradle to Grave series, we advance in age but go back in time. So you're a middle class, middle-aged artisan in the Middle Ages. Yes, that's a lot of middle. And we ask this question. If you could go back, would you go back? If certain conditions are met, I guess I would. Yeah, because it's a much simpler life. One of the things that would be shocking would be the level of casual cruelty. What was it like to be middle-aged in the Middle Ages? That's next time. Until then, take care of yourself and if you can, someone else, too.
