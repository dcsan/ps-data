  "cleanText": "Tech Philosophy and AI Opportunity was published on Tuesday, July 8th, 2025.\n\nOne of the most paradoxical aspects of AI is that while it is hailed as the route to abundance, the most important financial outcomes have been about scarcity. The first and most obvious example has been Nvidia, whose valuation has skyrocketed while demand for its chips continues to outpace supply. Another scarce resource that has come to the forefront over the last few months is AI talent. The people who are actually building and scaling the models are suddenly being paid more than professional athletes. And it makes sense. The potential financial upside from winning in AI are enormous. Outputs are somewhat measurable, and the work to be done is the same across the various companies bidding for talent. It's that last point that is fairly unique in tech history. While great programmers have always been in high demand and there have been periods of intense competition in specific product spaces, over the past few decades, tech companies have been franchises where in their market niches have been fairly differentiated: Google and search, Amazon and e-commerce, Meta and social media, Microsoft and business applications, Apple and devices, etc. This reality meant that the company mattered more than any one person, putting a cap on individual contributor salaries. AI, at least at this point, is different. In the long run, it seems likely that there will be dominant product companies in various niches. But as long as the game is foundational models, then everyone is in fact playing the same game, which elevates the bargaining power of the best players. It follows then that the team they play for is the team that pays the most through some combination of money and mission. By extension, the teams that are destined to lose are the ones who can't or won't offer enough of either.\n\nApple's reluctance. It's that last point I'm interested in. I'm not in a position to judge the value of any of the players changing teams, but the teams are worth examining. Consider Meta and Apple in the latest free agent signing from Bloomberg. Apple Inc.'s top executive in charge of artificial intelligence models is leaving for Meta Platforms Inc., another setback in the iPhone maker struggling AI efforts. Roming Pang, a distinguished engineer and manager in charge of the company's Apple Foundation models team, is departing, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Pang, who joined Apple from Alphabet Inc. in 2021, is the latest big hire for Meta's new super intelligence group, said The People, who declined to be named, discussing unannounced personnel moves. To secure paying, Meta offered a package worth tens of millions of dollars per year, The People said. Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has been on a hiring spree, bringing on major AI leaders including scale AI's Alexander Wong, startup founder Daniel Gross, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman with high compensation. Meta also hired Wanji Lee, a researcher from OpenAI, and Anton Bakton, who worked on Claude at Enthropic PBC, according to other people with knowledge of the matter. Last month, it hired a slew of other OpenAI researchers. Meta later on Monday confirmed it is hiring Pang. Apple, Pang, OpenAI, and Anthropic didn't respond to requests for comment. That Apple is losing AI researchers is a surprise only that they had researchers worth hiring. After all, this is the company who already implicitly signaled its AI reluctance in terms of that other scarce resource, Nvidia chips. Again from Bloomberg, former chief financial officer Luca Maestri's conservative stance on buying GPUs, the specialized circuits essential to AI hasn't aged well either. Under Cook, Apple has used its market dominance and cash to shape global supply chains for everything from semiconductors to the glass for smartphone screens. But demand for GPUs ended up overwhelming supply and the company's decision to buy them slowly, which was in line with its usual practice for emerging technologies it isn't fully sold on ended up backfiring. Apple watched as rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft Corp bought up much of the world supply. Fewer GPUs meant Apple's AI models were trained all the more slowly. Quote, \"You can't magically summon up more GPUs when the competitors have already snapped them all up.\" End quote. says someone on the AI team.\n\nIt may seem puzzling that the company that in its 2024 fiscal year generated $118 billion in free cash flow would be so cheap. But Apple's reluctance makes sense from two perspectives. First, the potential impact of AI and Apple's business prospects, at least in the short term, are fairly small. We still need devices on which to access AI, and Apple continues to own the high end of devices. There is, of course, long-term concern about AI obviating the need for a smartphone or meaningfully differentiating an alternative platform like Android. That significantly reduces the financial motivation for Apple to outspend other companies in terms of both GPUs and researchers. Second, AI, at least some of the more fantastical visions painted by companies like Anthropic, is arguably counter to Apple's entire ethos as a company. Text two philosophies. It was AI, at least the pre-LM version of it, that inspired me in 2018 to write about text two philosophies. One was represented by Google and Facebook, now Meta. Quote, in Google's view, computers help you get things done and save you time by doing things for you. Duplex was the most impressive example, a computer talking on the phone for you. But the general concept applied to many of Google's other demonstrations, particularly those predicated on AI. Google Photos will not only sort and tag your photos, but now propose specific edits. Google News will find your news for you, and Maps will find you new restaurants or shops in your neighborhood. And appropriately enough, the keynote closed with a presentation from Whimo, which will drive you. Zuckerberg, as so often seems to be the case with Facebook, came across as a somewhat more fervent and definitely more creepy version of Google. Not only does Facebook want to do things for you, it wants to do things its chief executive explicitly says would not be done otherwise. The messianic fervor that seems to have overtaken Zuckerberg in the last year though simply means that Facebook has adopted a more extreme version of the same philosophy that guides Google computers doing things for people. End quote. The other philosophy is represented by Apple and Microsoft. Quote earlier this week while delivering Microsoft's build conference keynote Sai and Adella struck a very different tone. This is technology's second philosophy and is orthogonal to the other. The expectation is not that the computer does your work for you, but rather that the computer enables you to do your work better and more efficiently. And with this philosophy comes a different take on responsibility. Pchai in the opening of Google's keynote acknowledged that quote, \"We feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right.\" End quote. But inherent in that statement is the centrality of Google generally and the direct culpability of its managers. Nadella, on the other hand, insists that responsibility lies with the tech industry collectively and all of us who seek to leverage it individually.\n\nThis second philosophy that computers are an aid to humans not their replacement is the older of the two. Its greatest proponent profit if you will was Microsoft's greatest rival and his analogy of choice was coincidentally enough about transportation as well. Not a car but a bicycle.\n\nI remember reading an article when I was about 12 years old. I think it might have been in scientific American where they measured the efficiency of locomotion for all these species on planet earth. Uh how many kilo calories did they expend to get from point A to point B and the Condor one came in at the top of the list surpassed everything else and humans came in about a third of the way down the list which was not such a great showing for the crown of creation. And but somebody there had the imagination to test the efficiency of a human riding a bicycle. A human riding a bicycle blew away the condor all the way off the top of the list. And it it made a really big impression on me that we humans are tool builders and that we can fashion tools that amplify these inherent abilities that we have to spectacular magnitudes. And so for me, a computer has always been a bicycle of the mind. Uh something that that takes us far beyond our inherent abilities. And I think we're just at the early stages of this tool, very early stages, and we've come only a very short distance and it's still in its formation, but already we've seen enormous changes. I think that's nothing compared to what's coming in the next 100 years.\n\nEnd quote. We are approximately 40 years on from that clip and Steve Jobs prediction that enormous changes were still to come is obviously preent. Mobile and the internet have completely transformed the world and AI is poised to make those impacts look like peanuts. What I'm interested in in the context of this article, however, is the interplay between business opportunity or risk and philosophy. Apple's position is here. In this view, the company's conservatism makes sense. Apple doesn't quite see the upside of AI for their business and isn't overly concerned about the downside, and its bias towards tools means that AI apps on iPhones are sufficient. Apple might be an increasingly frustrating platform steward, but they are at their core a platform company and apps on their platform are delivering Apple users AI tools. This same framework also explains Meta's aggressiveness. First, the opportunity is huge as I documented last fall on Meta's AI abundance. And for good measure, there is risk as well as time, the ultimate scarcity for an advertising based business is spent using AI. Second, Meta's philosophy is that computers do things for you. Given this graph, is it any surprise that Meta hired away Apple's top AI talent? I'm feeling lucky. Another way to think about how companies are approaching AI is through the late Professor Clayton Christensen's discussion around sustaining versus disruptive innovation. From an update last month after the news of Meta's hiring spree first started making waves. Quote, \"The other reason to believe in Meta versus Google comes down to the difference between disruptive and sustaining innovations. The late professor Clayton Christensen described the difference in the innovator's dilemma. Most new technologies foster improved product performance. I call these sustaining technologies. Some sustaining technologies can be discontinuous or radical in character while others are of an incremental nature. What all sustaining technologies have in common is that they improve the performance of established products along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character. An important finding revealed in this book is that rarely have even the most radically difficult sustaining technologies precipitated the failure of leading firms. Occasionally, however, disruptive technologies emerge, innovations that result in worse product performance, at least in the near term. Ironically, in each of the instances studied in this book, it was disruptive technology that precipitated the leading firms's failure. Disruptive technologies bring to a market a very different value proposition than had been available previously. Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets, but they have other features that a few fringe and generally new customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and frequently more convenient to use. The question of whether generative AI is a sustaining or disruptive innovation for Google remains uncertain 2 years after I raised it. Obviously, Google has tremendous AI capabilities both in terms of infrastructure and research, and generative AI is a sustaining innovation for its display advertising business and its cloud business. At the same time, the long-term questions around search monetization remain as pertinent as ever. Meta, however, does not have a search business to potentially disrupt and a whole host of ways to leverage generative AI across its business. For Zuckerberg and company, I think that AI is absolutely a sustaining technology, which is why it ultimately makes sense to spend whatever is necessary to get the company moving in the right direction. End quote. The problem with this analysis is the Google part. How do you square the idea that AI is disruptive to Google with the fact that they are investing just as heavily as everyone else and in fact started far earlier than everyone else? I think the answer goes back to Google's founding and the I'm feeling lucky button. Well, that button is now gone from google.com. I don't think it was an accident that it persisted long after it was even usable. Instant search results meant that by 2010 you didn't even have a chance to click it. I'm feeling lucky was a statement of purpose from 2016's Google and the limits of strategy. Quote, in yesterday's keynote, Google CEO Sunarpachai after a recounting of tech history that emphasized the PC web mobile epochs I described in late 2014 declared that we are moving from a mobile for first world to an AI first one. That was the context for the introduction of the Google Assistant. It was a year prior to the aforementioned iOS 6 that Apple first introduced the idea of an assistant in the guise of Siri. For the first time, you could theoretically compute by voice. It didn't work very well at first. Arguably, it still doesn't. But the implications for computing generally and Google specifically were profound. Voice interaction both expanded where computing could be done from situations in which you could devote your eyes and hands to your device to effectively everywhere. Even as it constrained what you could do, an assistant has to be far more proactive than, for example, a search results page. It's not enough to present possible answers. Rather, an assistant needs to give the right answer. This is a welcome shift for Google the technology. From the beginning, the search engine has included an I'm feeling lucky button. So confident was Google founder Larry Page that the search engine could deliver you the exact result you wanted. And while yesterday's Google Assistant demos were canned, the results, particularly when it came to contextual awareness, were far more impressive than the other assistants on the market. More broadly, few dispute that Google is a clear leader when it comes to the artificial intelligence and machine learning that underly their assistant. End quote. The problem, apparent even then, was the conflict with Google's business model. quote, \"A business though is about more than technology and Google has two significant shortcomings when it comes to assistance in particular. First, as I explained after this year's Google IO, the company has a go to market gap. Assistants are only useful if they are available, which in the case of hundreds of millions of iOS users means downloading and using a separate app or building the sort of experience that like Facebook users will willingly spend extensive amounts of time in. Secondly, though, Google has a business model problem. The I'm feeling lucky button guarantee that the search in question would not make Google any money. After all, if a user doesn't have to choose from search results, said user also doesn't have the opportunity to click an ad, thus choosing the winner of the competition Google created between its advertisers for user attention. Google Assistant has the exact same problem. Where do the ads go? End\n\n\nQuote.\nWhat I articulated in that article was Google's position on this graph.\nAI is the ultimate manifestation of \"I'm feeling lucky.\"\nGoogle has been pursuing AI because that is why Paige and Brin started the company in the first place.\nBusiness models matter, but they aren't dispositive.\nAnd while that may mean short-term difficulties for Google, it is a reason to be optimistic that the company will figure out AI anyways.\nMicrosoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic.\nFrameworks like this are useful, but not fully explanatory.\nI think this particular one goes a long way towards contextualizing the actions of Apple, Meta, and Google, but is much more speculative for some other relevant AI players.\nConsider Microsoft, which I would place here.\nMicrosoft doesn't have any foundational models of note, but has invested heavily in OpenAI.\nIts most important AI product are its various co-pilots, which are indeed a bet on the tool philosophy.\nThe question, as I laid out last year in enterprise philosophy and the first wave of AI, is whether rank and file employees want Microsoft's tools.\nQuote, notice though, how this aligned with the Apple and Microsoft philosophy of building tools.\nTools are meant to be used but they take validation to maximize their utility.\nThis I think is a challenge when it comes to co-pilot usage.\nEven before co-pilot came out, employees with initiative were figuring out how to use other AI tools to do their work more effectively.\nThe idea of copilot is that you can have an even better AI tool thanks to the fact it has integrated the information in the Microsoft graph and make it widely available to your workforce to make that workforce more productive.\nTo put it another way, the real challenge for Co-Pilot is that it is a change management problem.\nIt's one thing to charge $30 a month on a per seat basis to make an amazing new way to work available to all of your employees.\nIt's another thing entirely, a much more difficult thing to get all of your employees to change the way they work in order to benefit from your investment and to make C-Pilot pages the new artifact for the AI age in line with the spreadsheet in the personal computer age.\"\nEnd quote.\nThis tension explains the anecdotes in this Bloomberg article last month.\nOpenAI's net strength in the enterprise market is giving its partner and biggest investor indigestion.\nMicrosoft salespeople describe being caught flatfooted at a time when they're under pressure to get co-pilot into as many customers' hands as possible.\nThe behind-the-scenes dog fight is complicating an already front relationship between Microsoft and Open AAI.\nIt's unclear whether OpenAI's momentum with corporations will continue, but the company recently said it has 3 million paying business users, a 50% jump from just a few months earlier.\nA Microsoft spokesperson said Copilot is used by 70% of the Fortune 500, and paid users have tripled compared with this time last year.\nThis story is based on conversations with more than two dozen customers and salespeople, many of them Microsoft employees.\nMost of these people asked not to be named in order to speak candidly about the competition between Microsoft and OpenAI.\nBoth companies are essentially pitching the same thing: AI assistants that can handle ownerous tasks, researching and writing, analyzing data, potentially letting office workers focus on thornier challenges.\nSince both chat bots are largely based from the same open AI models, Microsoft Salesforce has struggled to differentiate copilot from the much better known chatpt.\nAccording to people familiar with the situation as long as AI usage relies on employee volition, chatbt has the advantage.\nWhat is interesting about this observation however is that it shows that OpenAI is actually in the same position as Microsoft.\nThis by extension explains why Anthropic is different.\nThe other leading independent foundational lab is clearly focused on agents, not chatbots, i.e. AI that does stuff for you instead of a tool.\nConsider the contrast between cursor and cloud code.\nCursor is an integrated development environment IDE that provides the best possible UI for AI augmented programming.\nCloud code on the other hand barely bothers with the UI at all.\nIt runs in the terminal which people put up with because it is the best at oneshotting outputs.\nThis Xthread was illuminating.\nCourtland Allen tweeted, \"Someone help me understand the appeal of clawed code compared to cursor.\nDoesn't have a real text box, so it's hard to select, manipulate, or copy text in your prompts as you write them.\nDoesn't stream back AI responses, so you have to wait for them to finish before reading them.\nMuch harder to audit all the file changes it's made.\nCan't go back up the tree to edit previous messages or responses, etc.\nWhat am I missing?\"\nJosh Pigford replied, \"Appeal is it's exponentially better at oneshotting requests.\nSeriously, it's so good there's very little back and forth required.\nSo the trade-offs end up being worth it.\"\nCourtland Allen replied, \"So basically worse UI but better agent/algorithm.\nMakes sense.\"\nMore generally, I wrote in an update after the release of Quad 4, which was heavily focused on agentic workloads.\nQuote, \"This by extension means that Anthropic's goal is what I wrote about in last fall's enterprise philosophy in the first wave of AI.\nQuote, computing didn't start with the personal computer, but rather with the replacement of the back office.\"\nOr to put it in rather more dire terms.\nThe initial value in computing wasn't created by helping boomers do their job more efficiently, but rather by replacing entire swaths of them completely.\nAgents aren't co-pilots, they are replacements.\nThey do work in place of humans.\nThink call centers and the like to start.\nAnd they have all the advantages of software always available and scalable up and down with demand.\nBenoff isn't talking about making employees more productive but rather companies.\nThe verb that applies to employees is augmented, which sounds much nicer than replaced.\nThe ultimate goal is stated as well: business results.\nThat right there is Tech Philosophy, improving the bottom line for large enterprises.\nNotice how well this framing applies to the mainframe wave of computing.\nAccounting and ERP software made companies more productive and drove positive business results.\nThe employees that were augmented were managers who got far more accurate reports much more quickly, while the employees who used to do that work were replaced.\nCritically, the decision about whether or not to make this change did not depend on rank and file employees changing how they worked, but for executives to decide to take the plunge.\nEnd quote.\nThis strikes me as a very worthwhile goal, at least from a business perspective.\nOpenAI is busy owning the consumer space, while Google and its best-in-class infrastructure and leading models struggles with product.\nAnthropic's task is to build the best agent product in the world, including not just state-of-the-art models, but all the deterministic computing scaffolding that actually makes them replacement level workers.\nAfter all, Anthropic's API pricing may look expensive relative to Google, but it looks very cheap relative to a human salary.\nEnd quote.\nThat means that Enthropic shares the upper right quadrant with Meta.\nAgain, this is just one framework.\nThere are others.\nMoreover, the boundaries are fuzzy.\nOpenAI is working on agentic workloads, for example, and the hyperscalers all benefit from more AI usage, whether user or agent-driven.\nGoogle, meanwhile, is rapidly evolving search to incorporate generative AI.\nAt the same time, to go back to the talent question, I don't think it's a surprise that Meta appears to be picking off more researchers from OpenAI than from Anthropic.\nMy suspicion is that to the extent mission is a motivator, the more likely an AI researcher is to be enticed by the idea of computers doing everything instead of merely augmenting humans.\nAnd by extension, the incumbent toolmakers may have no choice but to partner with the true believers.\nFor more analysis like this, please like
