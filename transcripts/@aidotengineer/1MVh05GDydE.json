  "cleanText": "All right, I need everybody to take a deep breath here because um I'm about to stress you out and uh but hopefully at the end I'll uh relieve that stress a little bit with some ideas and solutions for you.\nSo, I need everybody to just think for a second, reflect on the past 45 days and think about all the possible things that have gone on in our industry and all the product launches.\nLet me highlight just a few for you.\nUh, Notion launched a Granola, Glean, and Chat GPT competitors.\nFigma launched a Canva, framer, illustrator, and lovable competitor.\nAtlassian launched a granola, Glean competitor, plus cloud integrations.\nAnthropic launches a Glean competitor with cloud integrations.\nGoogle launches Codex, Lovable, and many other competitors.\nOpenAI bought a cursor competitor, launches codecs, and a lot more.\nRight?\nThis is just one little microcosm of the entire tech industry.\nBut if you look around at all the different categories of software right now, the same exact thing is happening.\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the horde of startups, well-funded startups, uh that are getting funded in every single one of these spaces as well.\nAnd among all of this chaos, we have companies that are essentially collapsing in months rather than years.\nChegg was one of the first ones to go that declined to over 90% in the matter of months.\nAnd of course, Stack Overflow was one of the early victims as well when chat GPT launched.\nSo this gets to the number one question that we all need to be answering, right?\nA lot of people at this conference are talking about how product is doing more engineering, engineering is doing more product work, design's doing more product work, all the tactical, all the technical, all of those different infrastructure.\nBut none of that matters.\nNone of it matters unless you answer this question.\nWhat do I build and why will it win?\nAnd the interesting thing about this is this was always the job of product.\nIt just happens to be that over the years it got marred in all of this uh project management, agile process, all of this type of stuff.\nBut this is what always separated great product managers from good product managers and product leaders.\nThis is Sean Claus.\nHe's the chief product officer at Confluent.\nHe was formerly chief product officer at MuleSoft.\nHe was the first head of growth at Atlassian as well.\nAnd I thought he encapsulated well.\nHe said, \"You're constantly trying to get ahead.\nYou're trying to find the angle.\nThe question that has not yet been asked that gives you an insight that is not being actioned by other people.\nIt doesn't just have to be an insight.\nIt has to be an insight that others are not actioning because if you find that insight and others aren't actioning it, that is your competitive advantage.\nNow, the problem is is that this question has gotten 10x harder.\nThis is a rough map of uh Gettysburg, and I thought it was a good analogy because this was one of the bloodiest battles in the Civil War.\nAnd this kind of represents the map that we are all playing in in the competitive environment right now.\nWe have fast huge moving incumbents like Microsoft, Google, and Meta.\nThere are these new huge horizontal platforms like chat, GPT and anthropic that are eating up major use cases.\nWe have foundational shifts in the technology landscape not on a yearly basis on a monthly basis and there are hordes and hordes of startups being funded including five or six in every single category that has traction by YC every single cohort.\nThis is you sitting in the middle of all of this, right?\nAnd the question is is how in the world do you find a seam among all of these players to potentially find some traction and win?\nThat's the question we have to answer before any of the other stuff like technology, infrastructure, or even what our roles are in the organization.\nI'm Brian.\nI'm founder and re-founder and CEO of Reforge.\nAnd uh if you notice, I have a little bit more gray hair and wrinkles from this picture because I've been around in tech for about 25 years, been doing startups the whole time.\nI played in some pretty competitive environments.\nI helped HubSpot launch their CRM almost a decade ago.\nAnd at that time, that was a crazy competitive category.\nPeople thought we were bonkers.\nMy guess is, if I took a raise of hand, probably over 50% of your companies are using that CRM today.\nNow, that was a competitive environment.\nBut what we're I'm experiencing now and what we're all experiencing is probably 10x that.\nAnd so, uh, a little history about Reforge is that we've been around for about 10 years.\nWe've helped thousands of product teams, including all the ones you see here, over 100,000 professionals.\nI hope some of you have been part of Reforge in the past.\nAnd the way that we've done it is that we've built a community of over 400 experts on the front lines to decode all of their best practices.\nWe started by doing that with 40 plus expert-led courses, including our AI courses.\nBut a couple years ago, we started to take a shift and started to encode all of this knowledge into AI agents.\nOur first one, Reforge Insights, which acts like your AI product researcher.\nOur second one called Compass is your project manager that takes care of all of those low-level, low-value tasks that involve product management, automated for you.\nWe have two more coming later this year.\nBut back to this question, how do you win in the intense environment in the history of technology?\nI spent a few months with Ravi Meta thinking about this exact question.\nHe created our AI strategy course.\nHe was the former chief product officer at Tinder.\nHe also was a product leader at Facebook, Microsoft, Trip Advisor and a bunch more.\nAnd the way that we start to answer this question is actually we need to think about the traps.\nAnd the two most common traps are of course one, how do you like reinventing the AI wheel?\nYou do not need to build custom models in infrastructure in order to answer this question.\nAnd on the opposite side is the other trap which is just implementing, copying and pasting basic AI features like chat bots into your product.\nThe answer actually lies in the middle which is treating AI like a series of Lego blocks where you assemble differentiated AI features and products by integrating the best available AI capabilities with your products data and functionality.\nYour competitive advantage will come from what is uniquely yours.\nThese three things, your data, your functionality, and your understanding of unmet customer needs, not the AI itself.\nSo, let's think about the anatomy of a winning AI product.\nWhat are the major building blocks?\nWhat are the major Lego pieces?\nAnd how do you stack them together, connect them to create something differentiated?\nWell, we can start to talk about this, the AI capabilities, because there's a ton of Lego pieces that are emerging every year.\nWhether it's the pre-trained AI models or the abilities to perform tasks, audio processing, imaging process, all of these new capabilities that feel magical now that we couldn't do before.\nBut the thing about all of these Lego blocks is you just don't have access to them.\nEverybody else has access to them as well.\nSo even though AI products and features of course use one of these Legos as its core Lego blocks, this is not where differentiation and competitive advantage comes from.\nThat starts with one of these pieces, your data.\nBecause your data is what provides context to a AI model to generate a unique output.\nThe more unique your data is, the more unique output you can generate for customer.\nAnd there's a bunch of different types of data.\nThere's real-time data that the models might not have incorporated into their training set.\nThere's user specific data.\nThere's domain specific data like we've seen emerging in legal in healthcare.\nThere's human judgment data around curation as well as reinforcement data.\nNow the question about data is how do you actually combine multiple categories of data together to form some uniqueness as well as it's not about the quantity of your data.\nIt's about the marginal value of your data over everybody else especially the big models.\nSo how much additional value does your data add over what is already trained in the models.\nThe third piece is your functionality because this determines how the AI behaves and it gives your AI product superpowers.\nThere's multiple types of Lego blocks around your functionality.\nSpecialized workflows, unique algorithms, business rules, integrations, whatever it is that's baked into your product.\nNow, the key about assembling all these pieces is that they work like a system and you have to connect the system in order to build that competitive differentiation.\nLet's start with this.\nYour data is what provides and informs the AI's understanding.\nIt's what helps you gener helps the AI generate a unique output.\nAnd that unique output as a result is what helps you build an additional repository of unique so that this continues to to flow in a flywheel.\nOn the other side of the spectrum is your functionality.\nYour functionality in your product is how your product controls the AI actions.\nHow it interacts with AI when it calls it to create a delightful user experience.\nAnd in addition, AI is AI's uh increasingly able to call tools in the functionality of your product itself.\nAnd those two things work together as a system as well.\nSo let's take all of this theory and let's put it into practice.\nLet's talk about a product granola.\nJust by a raise of hands, how many people have either tried or used granola today?\nOkay, pretty decent amount.\nThat's probably like 40% of the room.\nA year ago, that would have been zero.\nAnd I think this is an interesting case because they entered a space that already had a horde of other AI notetakers, whether that was Fathom, Otter, Fireflies, there was a ton of them.\nUm, but somehow they found a scene and they've garnered 40% of your attention in this room and about 50 million in funding.\nSo, let's go back to those three fundamental questions in those Lego bricks.\nWhat was uniquely theirs, their data, their functionality, and their understanding of their unmet customer need.\nI'm going to start with the last one.\nSo, at the time when they entered the market space, this is this is just a sample of people who are already in market, including all of the incumbents like Zoom and Meet that have AI native note-taking capabilities, but they were all approaching it from the perspective of the product is going to do something for the user.\nIt's going to replace the full job.\nThey want somebody else to take my meeting notes.\nWhat they realize is actually there's a whole other set of customer needs that have been unmet, which is I don't want you to take all of my notes.\nI just want you to help me take better notes.\nEmpower me around this specific task and user.\nAnd that's what they built the product around.\nNow, in order to start, they used off-the-shelf capabilities.\nNo unique models, no custom training, nothing.\nThey used deep gram for transcription.\nThey used anthropic and open AI for some of their other functionality, but the uniqueness came in how they assembled the Lego blocks.\nStarting with on the left hand side with granola's data, right?\nTheir context includes both the notes that you take as well as the transcription that they generate.\nThey use the AI Lego block to generate a unique output, which is they enhance better notes.\nThose notes over time form a repository that starts to enable all sorts of other features that they've layered on like chatting across meetings, uh their project workspaces, all their downflow actions.\nSo they have this nice flywheel of unique context in data that's starting to spin that was partially enabled by the right hand side of the Lego blocks, their functionality.\nThey used a Mac app so that they could detect when meetings started to access the system sound for transcription by being right there at the user h uh the the user moment that they needed it to enable the AI to do those things.\nAnd they've also plugged into other tools and integrations like the calendar to get metadata about the meetings such as attendees.\nSo they assembled these Lego blocks to meet in that unique way to meet that unique customer need.\nNow, the question is, is granola going to survive?\nI've got no idea, right?\nIt's an incredibly competitive landscape because the real the realization is that you can't stop here.\nYou can't stop by just assembling your initial set of Lego bricks.\nYou have to sequence over and over again.\nYou have to take those first three Lego LEGO bricks, leverage them into another unique set that you assemble.\nAnd you see Granola doing this.\nNow that they've enabled this, they've started to create project and team workspaces and start to uh enable a new set of unique use cases off of the initial layer that um they did.\nThey've started to integrate downstream actions like uh connecting to your CRM and HubSpot.\nUh that I just saw them the other day experimenting with a company wiki that autoupdates itself.\nSo they continue to sequence these things into a unique set of building blocks.\nThe question is is will they keep up?\nI don't know.\nJamon Ball, a partner at Alterimator Capital, recently wrote a newsletter and he said, \"The real moat is just a sequence of smaller moats stacked together.\nEach one buys time.\nWhat you do uh with that time, how fast you execute, how quickly you evolve determines whether you stay ahead.\nIf the moat used to be 6 to 12 months, today it's 2 to 3 weeks.\nSo to recap, to win an AI besides being stressed out, right, is to answer what are your unmet customer problems?\"\nThat's always been a part of product, right?\nThe second is what AI capabilities can solve those problems in novel ways.\nWhat proprietary data can power those solutions?\nAnd then what superpowers can our product give to AI?\nHow do you assemble those three foundational Lego blocks?\nAll right.\nThank you.\nIf you're if you're an AI engineer, we are hiring.\nOur team will be outside.\nWe can play with products with instant distribution to 300,000 people.\nAnd if you need help with anything else, just check out reforge.com.\nGood luck.\n[Music]\n",
