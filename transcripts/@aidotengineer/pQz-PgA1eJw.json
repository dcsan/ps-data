  "cleanText": "[Music]\nI'm Sid.\nI'm one of the co-founders of Oleve, and this is the New Lean Startup.\nWe've been seeing a fundamental shift in how successful companies are being built.\nMore and more companies are getting smaller, rounds are getting delayed, and profitability is being attained earlier than ever in their lifetime.\nA lot of this is being driven mainly by the advent of AI tooling.\nThese companies are generating millions of ARR with teams smaller than most startups' engineering departments.\nThe age of bloated teams and endless hiring rounds is over.\nWelcome to the era of tiny teams.\n\nFirst, a bit of background on Oleve.\nWe're building a family of iconic consumer software products that we hope will enable people to live better, more fulfilling, and productive lives.\nWe are a tiny team that scaled a portfolio of virally successful products to $6 million in R profitability and have generated over half a billion views across social media, achieving this with a tiny team of just four.\nWe're based out of New York City.\nAnd here's a brief history on us.\n\nOn the 26th of January in 2023, we launched a Quizard AI mobile app.\nWe launched it with a Tik Tok video that went viral overnight and generated million views that turned into 10,000 users in less than 30 hours.\nWe actually started scaling with no LLM costs.\nThis is because back then we had the initial Codeex model launch, which was in beta preview.\nFunny enough, we were cycling between 10 different accounts from our friends just so that we could prompt engineer or generate these AI outputs.\nInterestingly enough, Codeex, even though it was meant for a coding model, could be prompt engineered for any open domain conversation.\nAs you all may know, it ended up being sunset for abuse.\nWe ended up getting reached out directly by OpenAI on a few of our different accounts that we were cycling through as being one of the top model users for the Codex model at the time.\n\nMy co-founders and I then graduated, and then we moved to New York City the fall of 2023, where we started our back-to-school campaign, which was a series of man on the street videos across different prestigious colleges in the US.\nThis is when we hit our first million dollars in ARR and also achieved profitability within the first nine months of operating.\n\nWe then even had another successful campaign in the spring of 2024 that got us all the way to number six in the charts of Education alongside giants like Duolingo, Photomath, and Golf.\n\nWe then took all our learnings in the spring of '24 and doubled down on a new product, Unstuck AI, a study companion tool for students.\nWe were able to get to a million users in under nine weeks and generate over quarter billion views across socials in a month.\n\nA few weeks ago, we were able to get both products in the top 10 in the Education charts.\nUnstuck went all the way up to number three in the Education charts, right under Goth and Duolingo.\n\nWe've now also launched in stealth our third product, which is our first product outside the Education domain.\nIt took 3 weeks to build thanks to all the blueprints that we've built in advance.\nWe'll speak more on this later.\nAnd I've already reached a,000 plus users.\nBy the way, it's already profitable.\n\nOur lean playbook boils down to three key pillars: operating principles that lay the foundation of leanness, organizational structure that set up the systems for this leanness, and AI tooling augmentation which optimizes scaling.\n\nLet me start with operating principles, which I believe is the main bedrock for why we're so lean.\nIt starts with hiring.\nWe either hire right or not at all.\nWe only hire 10xer generalists that have multiple complimentary spikes in similar fields.\nSo for example, our product engineers are full stack developers, great product thinkers, and really good at fundamentals of computer network, for example.\nWe also have marketers who can code.\nWe have designers who can build and the likes.\nWe try to aim for people whose complimentary spikes can shape and drive 10x outputs within the team.\nThe second key principle is profit-first mentality.\nWe are relentless about prioritizing profits because profit is power and profit is focus.\nProfit gives us a clear mechanism to make all our decisions and guide a north star for the company.\nThis leads to our third principle: Does this move your KPI?\nEveryone in the company owns a KPI.\nKPI alignment removes micromanagement because everyone is focused on moving their metric week over week.\nThis also means decisions must be validated against this KPI.\n\nOur fourth principle is continuous process refinement.\nFor any repeating process, we always ask how would we do this better?\nIs there any way we can improve?\nWhat was wrong about this run that we this previous run?\nWe view failures in the company and issues in the company as systems failures, which lets us set up a feedback loop for improving ourselves, improving the process that we used both on an operational standpoint, but also a technical standpoint.\n\nThe fifth pillar is super tools.\nWe're pretty lazy.\nSo, we like to consolidate a lot of our workflows onto one platform if we can.\nAnd that ends up being meaning that we have to reinvent the ways we use old tools.\nMore on this in a bit.\n\nAnd the last principle I'd emphasize is don't learn it twice.\nWe believe in building compounding benefits by investing in technical playbooks and operational blueprints.\nThis allows us to compound our benefits or compound our learnings so that the benefits can be yielded across new products.\nThis is exactly how we were able to hit a million users on Unstuck within nine weeks, taking everything we learned over a year and a half on Quizard.\n\nMore on the super tools concept.\nFor example, one of our super tools is Launch Darkly.\nThe intended use case of Launch Darkly is a feature management platform that helps software teams control and release features safely and quickly.\nHere are some of our extended use cases.\nWe use Launch Darkly as a manual traffic load balancer.\nSpecifically, we put Launch Darkly in between all our LM calls so that we can reroute traffic to different LM providers based on hitting rate limits, different strategic initiatives, or whatever.\nIt just gives us an on-the-fly mechanism for choosing where our traffic goes and allows us to split things within rate limits.\nThis was especially important in the early days when rate limits were really tight and also it was hard to, yeah, rate limits were really tight.\nIt was hard to get quotas increased on individual endpoints.\nSpecifically, I'm talking about Azure OpenAI.\n\nThe second extended use case is on-the-fly infrastructure changes.\nFor us, this looks like how on Unstuck, which takes in a lot of files to ingest, for specific file formats, we have a lot of waterfall ingestion processes.\nWhat I mean by that is we depend on a lot of third-party services that can be reliable.\nBy using Launch Darkly, we're able to change the prioritization of these processes on the fly.\nSo that if one of these third-party services goes down, we're able to reorganize the service on the fly to make sure it's up and running and available to our users worldwide.\n\nThe third extended use case is UI modifications and paywall experiments without having code pushes.\nWe've built an experimentation layer around Launch Darkly which allows us to run and spin up experiments without needing to make a code push.\n\nThe third, or sorry, the second pillar that guides our leanness is our organizational structure, especially in our engineering org, in the way we hire and that we organize our engineers.\nFor this we look to Palantir, who successfully scaled across multiple market segments.\nWe believe that we're building the consumer version of Palantir with our harvester and cultivator model.\nLet me explain this for harvesters.\nThese are product engineers similar to the pounder deltas of the four deployed software engineers that own and live and die by their products.\nThey're living in the metrics, working on AB experiments, building features end to end, working with the marketing team, and effectively owning the entire product's existence.\nHarvesters are people who build products that people actually want and pay for.\n\nThen we have the cultivators.\nCultivators are AI software engineers whose main goal is building the company's agentic operating system.\nThey're pioneering automation across different business units including marketing, design, product with the idea of expanding infrastructure that affects all the users everywhere and helps us win in every market.\nCultivators are creating the foundation that let us ship and scale faster in any market.\n\nAnd finally, the last pillar is AI-driven and AI and tool augmentation.\nOne important note in thinking about this is when we think about hiring, we like to think of tool use as being something that will allow a 10xer become a 100xer as opposed to the contrast, which is using tools to fill gaps and augment the shortcomings of someone who's not at the standard that we like to hire for.\n\nWith that being said, we use a slew of products for our day-to-day task automation for things like script writing, campaign analysis, operations, code generation, and communications.\nEffectively, by paying for a bunch of services, we have augmented and enabled everyone to have their own chief of staff within the company.\n\nNow, back to the blueprints.\nOne more thing is we believe heavily in compounding benefits and reinvesting in blueprints.\nThis includes things like code complete templates which build in all the learnings that we've learned over the two and a half years of scaling products with virality in mind, reusable internal libraries and modules that govern our core services that we use like our LM providers and shared infrastructure that we use across applications such as our notification system or the experimentation layer that I talked about earlier, being in consumer experimentation is kind of the backbone of everything we do, and that's why it is always built out as a first layer into every new product that we launch.\nBut while blueprints give us a deterministic leverage and compounding effects, what happens when these blueprints can be executed on demand by systems that can learn and adapt and coordinate faster than real teams?\nAt Oleve, we're thinking about taking this further and how AI can augment the future of our work.\nAnd this is devised into, well, three specific stages.\nThe first stage is human-led tooling.\nWe build specialized tooling that sits and is embedded into the workflows of our different teams across marketing, product, and design.\nThis includes things like internal dashboards, scraping tools, and prompt chain agents.\nThe whole idea is we are trying to augment the day-to-day task of anyone on our team.\nStage two of this automation includes workflow automation where we actually take off entire processes from people in the team.\nI.e., we have now consolidated on the individual tools that we built them to augment their workflows to now take over the entire workflows.\nThis frees up bandwidth on their end to take on more interesting task or or take take on more high-leverage opportunities within the company.\n\nThe third stage of all this is consolidating all the workflows that we've built under one autonomous decision-making system, i.e., an orchestration of multiple agents working together to serve the role of an of one new employee.\nPart of the goal with Oleve is to build a company where we hire people for their strategic insight, their talent, and their taste, but run the entire company on a bunch of agents.\nWe've already started this.\nFor example, we've started building platforms that drive our market research so that we can find out lucrative markets to launch our new product into as well as our acquisition process as we start to acquire new apps and scale the company.\nThis includes things like agents that are scanning the markets consistently and daily for lucrative opportunities, categories are doing super well, and trends in the market, as well as scoring acquisition targets for strategic fit.\n\nWe've also started scaling our and augmenting our growth systems.\nThe same principles apply in terms of leveraging tools and AI.\nWe are trying to automate our virality engine.\nThis includes monitoring content, having on-the-fly feedback loops be kicked off when we have certain events being triggered, and also dealing with relationships as we work with creators and influencers and such.\n\nBut we think we can take this further.\nWe imagine a world where we can have one strategic person sit on top of an army of specialized agents.\nInstead of managing people, it becomes a game of commanding capability.\nThey set the objective, the agents execute, and the system improves over time.\nBut what we really want to build is a larger future where we can have not just one person running a team, but one person running an entire product or commanding a commanding multiple clusters of agents that serve different business units.\nWe see a world where we can have people run entire portfolios of apps themselves just by leveraging the systems that we build and automate over time.\nThis is effectively our vision.\nWe're building a portfolio of one-person billion-dollar companies.\nAs a quick aside before I wrap up here, I will be talking tomorrow about Trellis, which is which stands for targeted refinement of emerging LM intelligence through structured segmentation.\nIt is a framework that I came up with for scaling reliable AI user experiences to 5 million users, designed specifically around our virality engine, i.e., it is built for systems where you intend to go viral as your main go-to-market.\nThis will be part of the testing the untestable talk tomorrow at 2:20 p.m. in the s room.\nThank you for listening.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n",
