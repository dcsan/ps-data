  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nIt's so nice to see a generative media track in the AI conference, AI engineer conference this year.\nUm, we, my company, I work at this company called fal.ai.\nUh, we call ourselves a generative media platform.\nUh, and this is a term that's been around for a while.\nUh, but we kind of owned it, and we called it, uh, the name of our company, generative media platform.\nUh, and the way we define it, at least, is it's a generative video, audio, or image.\nAnd, uh, our company is seeing all these kinds of models using our inference engine, and we are partnering up with some closed source model providers as well.\nSo, I've been doing this for a couple of years, but it is a really, really new market, and throughout the talk, I'm going to walk you through how we got here and a little bit of the history and what's next.\n\nI remember in 2022 when Sam Altman started tweeting about Delhi too.\nUm, I was working at home.\nIt was end of COVID.\nI know COVID took a little longer in San Francisco, but I, I remember sitting on the floor.\nCould not believe my eyes.\nPeople were tweeting at him, and he was tweeting back pretty high definition images of incredible things that people were tweeting.\nLike, looking back to it, obviously it all looks kind of bad quality, but I remember at the time I was, I thought this was the most incredible technology ever.\nAnd I was, I was in the industry.\nI knew what was going on, not as much as today, but I, I thought at that time OpenAI was so far ahead of anything else, and it's going to be so, so hard for, uh, normal people to catch up to this technology.\nI was, I was, I remember this was one of the biggest WTF moments of my life.\n\nBut then you can tell me, hey, Gam, this was, this was all gonna happen.\nUh, there was other AI waves before, before this last big wave.\nUh, there was a GAN breakthrough that people did similar things using GANs, deep dream from Google went through a phase, and then there was even a viral, uh, consumer AI application of it called Prism.\nPeople uploaded their selfies, and they were able to change their avatars.\nBut, uh, the capabilities and the applications of the technology was not nearly as much as what generative media can be used today.\nNot only the previous AI wave, generative media, or being able to create art with computers has been around kind of since the computers has been around.\nUm, this guy Harold Cohan, this is a recreation of his project, but basically he created these massive computers to draw, draw on these huge canvas, uh, to create art similar to how a human would draw.\nAnd then we have, uh, computer graphics and generative graphics, things like that.\nThroughout the years, people tried to generate visuals and art using different computing technologies all along.\n\nUh, right after Sam Altman's tweet, uh, playing field evened out really, really quickly.\nSo, Del 2 was April 6.\nRight after that, Mjourney released their initial model in beta as a Discord bot.\nAnd then very quickly after that, uh, stable diffusion opens sourced their model, which was a huge, huge thing.\nPeople now were able to run a technology similar to Delhi 2 in their homes, in their home GPUs.\nPeople started building services around it, and then SDXI came out, and then now there's many different image models, open and closed source, and most recently flux was released, um, early, uh, in the in the summer last year.\nAnd with all this playing field evening out, the marginal cost of creation is approaching zero, and I'm, I'm very careful when I choose my words here.\nI'm not saying marginal cost of creativity.\nIt's marginal cost of creation.\nI think the storytelling is still really important.\nCreativity is still really important.\nBut once, once you have that set up, creating that next new thing is, is approaching zero.\nAnd we believe this is going to have huge impacts on different kinds of industries and markets.\nSo, anything from social media, advertising, marketing, fashion, obviously film and movies, gaming, and e-commerce is going to be transformed by generative media.\nAnd this transformation is going to continue until all content, one way or the other, is impacted by AI.\n\nUm, so if you've been following, software has been eating media all along.\nUh, YouTube, just from basically ads, is generating more revenue than any other media company except Disney.\nThis is, this is pretty remarkable.\nAnd with Disney revenue, there is clearly non-media revenue in there.\nThey have parks, they have cruise ships, they have other things.\nSo, it's not too hard to say YouTube right now is one of the highest revenue-generating media companies in the world, and it is happening through, through ads, and whenever, uh, ad industry is impacted by technology, it usually grows in volume.\nSo, we believe the same thing is going to happen with, with generative media and ads.\n\nUh, we believe ad industry is one of, is going to be the first industries to be impacted at a large scale by generative media.\nWe believe the size of the industry is going to increase.\nSo, it's really funny, in since 2000, every ad spend has, so grew three, three times since 2000, but all that growth happened in software ads.\nSo, we believe something similar is going to happen with AI, uh, driven ads, and ad industry is going to grow, and most of that growth is going to come from AI, and there are several different ways how this can happen.\nWe believe ads themselves are hyperpersonalized.\nSo, this might mean, um, you are generating many different versions of the same ad, but maybe 10,000 different demographics really quickly, or it can, it can also mean it's targeted towards a certain individual.\nIf you are coming from a certain website, then the ad can be generated on the fly, uh, and then it could also be interactive in ways you know that, that I just mentioned, things generated on the fly, and that that might mean many different things in the industry.\nOne other thing why I think generative media fits the ad industry very well is the abundance of content.\nFor example, I, I probably won't watch a blockbuster movie every single day.\nSo, like, even if we have a thousand more movies this year, I, I probably have to sit down and watch a movie a day to go through all of them.\nBut I probably won't be able to do that.\nBut ads, there can be kind of unlimited content.\nEvery time I'm on my phone, I'm seeing ads on TV.\nThere are ads all the time, and it doesn't matter if the ad is different.\nLike, maybe there needs to be some consistency, but ad industry can, can actually survive with a lot more content, and things can get a lot creative.\n\nSo, we, we were ahead of the time a little bit.\nLast year, we did a, we did an ad promo with A24 Civil War movie, and it was one of those interactive ideas that I was, I was talking about.\nSo, if you've seen the movie, it's about, uh, a imaginary civil war in the US, and they had this campaign of these little green toy soldiers, and they created a live marketing site where you could put a selfie, and then, uh, we, we created a little toy soldier with your selfie and your description.\nUh, and they put this on Time Square.\nPeople were able to display their own faces on these little green toy soldiers.\nSo, AI is going to help us create experiences like this that are interactive and personalized.\n\nThe other trend we are watching really closely is e-commerce.\nUm, if you've been paying attention to it, e-commerce is growing about 1% uh, every year, getting percentage of the US retail industry.\nSo, this is a trend that's happening with or without AI, and we believe generative media is gonna play a big, big part on e-commerce's growth as well.\n\nIt's, it's already, there are many companies trying to redefine how people shop online, and because online shopping is very visual, AI can add a lot of interactivity to the experience.\nIn fact, it's one of the earliest product market fits I've seen in generative media.\nThis has been happening for a couple months, maybe a year, that virtual try-on is one of the clearest product market fits that I see in the AI industry.\nMany different retailers, e-commerce websites are adapting, adapting this technology.\nMany different startups are being built, uh, on it.\nSo, I believe this is going to be everywhere.\nEvery retailer, every e-commerce website is a potential generative media user.\n\nAnd then there is video.\nUm, so when, when Sam tweeted Delhi too, I thought OpenAI was so far ahead, and no one was able to catch up.\nPeople caught up incredibly fast.\nSo, this time he did the same trick with Sora when Sora was released a year and a half ago, basically.\nAnd this time around, maybe Sora was even more impressive than Delhi 2 in terms of, uh, how far ahead things looked like.\nBut, uh, this time around, I was incredibly excited that researchers at OpenAI was able to actually do things like this.\nAnd from, from the past experience, and I know that if this is possible in one place, people are going to go be able to do similar things in others.\nSo, I was incredibly excited when Sam Elman started tweeting about Sora because I knew very soon a technology like this was going to be everywhere.\nIn fact, it started happening.\nSo, this is a little snapshot of our company's revenue, which I think is a good proxy of the entire market.\nUh, early this year, in October, we barely had any video model, uh, usage in the platform, and in February, this went all the way up to 18%.\nUm, I didn't get time to update it, but I looked yesterday, it's around 30% today.\nSo, it is growing really fast, even though it's expensive, even though it still doesn't work as well.\nUh, video models are going to completely take over the generative media market, and I have some predictions about how much bigger the video market is going to be compared to the image market.\nSo, rough math, but we believe video models are 20x more compute intensive.\nAnd let's say if it's 5x more engaging, and it's going to impact more industries because it's going to be more useful to the industry, we believe all said and done, the video market is going to be, generative video market is going to be 100x to 250x, uh, bigger than the image generation market.\nUh, and we are just scratching the surface here.\nI believe the image generation market has a ton of growth that's going to happen in the next couple of years as well, but video is growing much, much faster than that.\nAnd when all said and done, it's going to be a much bigger, uh, market.\n\nAnd yeah, video models are leveling up as well.\nYou probably have all seen the newest model from DeepMind from Google, V3.\nUh, we keep adding new capabilities, uh, into the video models.\nFirst it was consistency, and then now with sound, uh, really the things people are generating with it is, is incredible, and every time a new capability is added, it unlocks a different use case in the industry.\nSo, um, it's, it's not on our platform yet, but I'm, I'm very curious to see how people are going to start creating using V3 and what, what different use cases it's going to unlock in the ad industry or, or the e-commerce industry.\nSo, that is very interesting to see.\nSo, where is, where is the video market going?\nUh, we believe there is so, so much to improve.\nUm, we are going to have faster and cheaper video generation until video generation basically becomes real time.\nUh, so generating one second of video in one second.\nSo, you'll be able to stream generated content, uh, to the user, and this is going to have very different implications on how people interact with this technology.\nEverything, uh, potentially becomes interactive.\nThe line between games and, and movies, uh, gets blurred.\nUm, so how is this going to impact social apps?\nHow it's going to impact live events?\nUh, people like, if you play Fortnite or similar games, people are already having live events there.\nIs it going to become, uh, more lifelike, are more norm like, the our parents, like, you know, people who are not used to playing video games are going to be part of this experience?\nI'm, I'm really curious about the future of this technology.\n\nAnd then image models are not done yet as well.\nUm, there's been a lot of different, uh, improvements in the past couple of months on the image models as well.\nUh, Flux, context, and GPT40, uh, introduced new editing capabilities, better text rendering capabilities.\nAt one point people thought, okay, maybe this is as good as image models are going to get.\nBut with these new releases, uh, and new capabilities, it is opening up to more use cases in the industry.\nWhenever we see a technological shift like this happening, we see a lot of different, um, more mature players in the industry picking up, uh, these technologies.\nSo, we believe something similar is going to happen with flux, context, and GPT4, and it's going to blend into more of the enterprise use cases people are, uh, trying to do.\nUm, and then this is, this is pretty much it.\nUm, we, we are hiring, so please visit our website, fi/careers.\nUh, we, we are hiring machine learning engineers, inference engineers, product engineers, uh, all sorts of positions, and I'll be hanging around the rest of the day today.\nSo, find me, talk to me, would love to discuss whatever, uh, related to generative media or about the industry in general.\nUh, thank you so much.\n\n[Music]\n",
