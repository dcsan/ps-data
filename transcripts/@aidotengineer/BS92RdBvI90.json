  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHello everyone. My name is Jax and uh I'm a founding engineer at K-Scale Labs. We build open-source humanoid robots from hardware to software to um machine learning models and we build it especially for developers. Yeah. So, humanoids have been have been getting a lot of hype recently. You see the Tesla Optimus, you have Unit robots, you have uh 1X and etc. Um they're quite proprietary and they're quite expensive. And the humanoids are getting so much hype is because of very big problems like physical labor shortage, consumer household and also like off-world exploration and etc. Yeah. So for us at K-Scale Labs, our goal is to really solve general purpose uh robotics for everyone and open sourcing the entire stack to the entire world. So everyone will be benefiting from this really really useful technology instead of a few different uh companies. Yeah. And uh our team is about 15 people in Palo Alto. Um you could visit us anytime. We're launching some robots in the next coming month. And uh yeah, I'll be demoing some robots in the slides. Cool. So, we're currently working on two robots uh the K-Bot and Z-Bot. The K-Bot is a 411 uh humanoid robot that we made in the last five months. Uh it has a full aluminum body, runs a RL controller for local motion, and it has a it's pretty sensor complete. So, it can do all the really cool tasks that um the previous presenter was showing. And this will also be one of the cheapest humanoid robots on the market and it's ready for pre-order right now. Delivered by October. Yeah. So if you come visit, this is a demo we do. Uh you can kick the robot. Um the controller is quite robust and the robot is can take a lot of damage. Um on the robot itself, you also have basically you can do VR teleoperation with building hands. Um I'll describe the modularity a bit more, but yeah. So the robot's able to run a bunch of different local manipulation policies running our own RL training framework. So when we started building the K-Bot, we thought about like how do we make human humanoids scale in the future and what makes it what makes it possible for people to adopt humanoid robots. So we basically designed this human robot to be the simplest possible uh factor as possible and it's going to be the most affordable developer and research grade human robot at $9,000. Uh the next cheapest option is probably at $40k which is the Unit robot. Um this is roughly the cost of most robot arms today. Like if you buy UR5 that's I think $15k or etc. So the entire robot is going to be open source. What that means is we're going to have open BOM. Every single piece of the hardware, CAD design, electronics, PCB, software, uh machine learning models will be fully open sourced. So you can replicate this um if you want to. And it's also going to be very very modular which means that um you can basically change out end-effectors. We have different mechanical designs that you can easily make interface with our uh end-effectors and you can just take out uh the hand to for a parallel gripper instead of a five uh five-finger hand or you can use whatever end-effector you want to use like the WMY grippers or etc. And that means is we can also easily upgrade and also fix the robot. So our goal with selling this to developers that when we have new hardware updates, you can easily just rescrew the robot in with brand new legs or brand new arms and also um brand new head. So you know as compute improves like you get new Nvidia chips, you can easily just add a new head onto the robot. Um yeah, we're also building we have built entire Python Rust SDK for people to use. Um if you come visit us, you can start programming this robot basically immediately. It's like pip install style package and you can start working on it and it's capable of running the latest state-of-the-art ML um algorithms. So in terms of local motion you can use like Nvidia's Sim uh to train policy. We use MJX um which I'll explain a bit later but you can use all kinds of different frameworks. You can also run like different VLMs like language models on the robot maybe not locally directly but you can run through cloud or you can run uh VAs and etc as well. Um so if this robot by default it's going to be five DOF arms but you can easily interchange to a seven DOF arm. So that will suit most of the research need research labs need and we'll make continuous like model and software improvements with OTA rollouts. So every every week basically we'll make new changes to the software as we go. Yeah. Uh here are some more specs. I can't release the full spec yet because we're launching soon. Um but yeah, you see it uses MIT Cheetah actuators uh pretty standard components with like um MUS uh just different audio modules, displays, cameras um and up to 250 TOPS compute currently. Yeah. And we we really started this project in about October last year. So we've been moving pretty fast. We had brought this to uh mass manufacturing and we have a new basically design that we completed that I can't show you now but you'll be able to see in two weeks. Yeah. So we started off this uh the K-Bot is like the K-Scale Stompy project like a full-sized humanoid robot that's 3D printable. Then we moved to like a prototype and we work with different manufacturing partners to actually make the new one uh that you see. Yeah, it's launching soon if you're interested. um in a K-Bot. You can go to k-scale.dev. Yeah. I'll give you a second. No, I'm not done. Whoa. That's only one robot. Not even one third finished. Joking. Yeah. And so what if what if you can't spend $9,000 on a cool human robot? Um what if your like wife or husband doesn't allow you to do it? Well, introducing the Z-Bot, which is a 1 ft 5 um 1.5 feet uh humanoid robot that we also made at K-Scale Labs. So, this started from a hackathon project we did. Um it became really popular on Twitter and also WeChat. And so, we're bringing this robot to mass mass manufacturing as well. It runs the same local motion and software stack. Like that means you can basically program stuff in uh for the small robot but you can also put it on the big robot. So you know if you make like a voice chatting app you can just put it on the idle robots and it runs also local motion policy as well. It works out with all the simulators. Um yeah we really got inspired by the Google DeepMind's uh robot soccer robot soccer paper where you know it runs around play soccer. That's really how we were envisioning it. So yeah um We have a pretty good the launch went really well for the 3D printing one. So, our Discord has about 5,000 people. I think a few hundred people have actually made a 3D printed one on the the orange one on the bottom. Yeah. So, we also started this project in November and we are already bringing it to mass manufacturing which will also be launching very soon. Um, some people Yeah. We also run like monthly hackathons so you can just come try out the robot. Yeah. Yeah, same same website. Okay. Okay. Um, that's the hardware stuff. We talked about the hardware components. We just open sourced. Oh, yeah. Also, Z-Bot will be fully open sourced as well. Um, and so we also open source our entire ML and software stack. So really like our core end goal is basically to make this um make the K-Bot autonomous. Well, so you know it's a pretty standard uh dual policy. You have the high-level controller which is a VLA. Then you have the RL whole body local motion policy. Yeah. So what we really want right now is to basically finish we're currently working on both basically the RL part and also the VLA part. And we also made our own uh firmware software architecture to power these robots in Rust. Yeah. Our end goal is basically to make the robot so easy to use. Um any developer could write apps for robots. So you know Python application that you can reshare with people you make the robot do some very specific use cases that can be reused by other people. It's almost like an app store and to do that basically um we offer a lot of really cool developer tools we've been working on in the last six months. So we open sourced the library for basically GPU accelerated robot learning. Well it's mostly like local motion manipulation training. Uh we use MJX for this and yeah the the video if you saw us kicking the robot it runs the controller our controller uh our model that we train in this uh training framework. Yeah we also are working on to basically being able to integrate and fine-tune all the different VLA and generalist policies that you see from PI Zero also Nvidia group that we're also presenting today. So this robot will be able to run, you know, we're trying to make the infrastructure very easy to run any cool models that you see. That would be useful. Yeah, we also made this uh operating system which is like a software framework plus like a Python interface that you can use to program the robot using Python or Rust. So, you know, you can just instead of I don't know if you guys use ROS 1, ROS 2, they're pretty hard to set up, but using our system, you can just install Python package like pip install k-scale and you can start programming robot. You just connect to IP. It's very, very easy to use. And we also have a digital twin in simulation. We call it a K-Sim. It has the same gRPC interface you can use for uh controlling robot in simulation. And all you have to do between programming something in simulation and real is by changing the IP address. So you can prototype really really rapidly without having to worry about breaking the robot which is very cool. So yeah this is also fully open sourced. Uh you can try today you can actually program the robot um just by using K-Sim. Oh, I don't know what happened to the images, but yeah. And then what the what basically what the machine learning and the operating system layers enables for us to run different policies, VLA models and on our robot hardware and for people to develop really cool applications with. So yeah, I'm just going to go through like a very very quick uh RL training and deployment examples of how um researchers and developers could use our robot to train a local manipulation policy for the robot to you know grab different things or walk around or even dance. So yeah our training setup is very easy. You just get clone the repository and then all you have to do is python -m and in this train.py Pi is you effectively have all the training code you need uh abstracted. It's about 500 lines for walking. Yeah. And then basically you can run this on like you know using runp your local GPU. It's MJX so it's like you know it's accelerated um accelerated compute and training a walking policy roughly takes one hour to uh two hours and yeah so you're just going to run through like millions of different um not examples uh yeah iterations of the robot performing task you want and you can tune the reward functions and etc and you can see the loss and reward functions in um our observability basically tensorboard um yeah and afterward when the robots finish training you can easily evaluate it in K-Sim. Uh so all you have to do is like K uh K inverse like you run the policy. Yeah. And in simulation and you see the robot if it's walking if well if you can see if it's doing the thing you want it to be doing for example like walking standing uh picking up objects and if that's really good in simulation then you can just easily change the IP address and then you have sim to deployment. Yeah. And uh it's very cool like you can basically get a robot to work in like one-tenth of the time of like what you would take to set up most uh training libraries right now. And also like we're a team of 15 people. So we do everything from hardware to software to ML. So how we're able to do this is actually by working with our open source community. Currently we have about like 5,000 relative active Discord members in a few servers. We have a lot of public open bounties that people are tackling and of our because of our software MIT licensed. Yeah. A lot of people are coming to help us and we also run hackathons almost on a bi-monthly basis that a lot of people come to participate. Yeah. So we're also hiring electrical firmware and ML engineers. So if you're interested, feel free to uh ask me and then also go on the k-scale.dev joint website. Um yeah, we're trying to hire a lot more cracked people to join us. Yeah, so we're launching a robots and software stack in about two three weeks. Um if you're interested, follow on the website. I'll be happy to answer any questions. [Applause] Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good. Uh, go ahead. Yes. Where's the power? Where's the power? The battery. Yeah. Yeah, it's battery packed. Yeah, it just has a battery. I don't know if I can show you in the picture. Yeah, it's behind this basically. You can just slot in like it clicks in. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. The weight of the battery versus longevity. What do you mean? Yeah. Longevity. Oh, like how long is Yeah. Uh walking so far our test is about two hours, but you can pass through. So you can power through the wall plug. So it's Yeah. You can just keep letting it charge and also run at the same time. Yeah. Yes. Uh well, black jacket. Yeah. What are the use cases that you guys are imagining to start off with? Is this going to be more for like commercial like you know factory kind of use cases or do you envision this more in the home like helping out? Yeah. So basically our bet so a lot of companies like especially in the US are betting on like B2B. So like Figure for example are selling to factories since Tesla itself is the customer. For us, our really bet is becoming the first US consumer robotics company like robot humanoid robotics company. Yeah. So really selling it to anyone that's interested in developing robotics. So a lot of our current customers, we accidentally launched our robots like people accidentally started buying our robots through our Shopify page. Um that was a complete mistake. But a lot of people that bought were just people genuinely interested in using for household task like programming it for different research and also there are a lot of companies also interested in working with us um to make B2B businesses like for example the food um food demo that we just saw. Yeah. Sorry if I can ask a follow like what household like chores do you think it would be well suited for like unloading the dishwasher for example? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nI mean, right now, right now we don't have any. I don't think anyone really has a fully working VA model yet. So right now it's pretty limited to TA operating system, uh, sorry, TA operation. So, yeah, um, but soon we, we hope to be able to have like this navigation VA stack for you to do like, you know, folding clothes or like doing dishwashing as the model capabilities improve. You. Yes. White shirt. Oh, I mean green shirt. Yeah, you can go first. Can I ask? Yeah, of course. Okay. Yeah. Uh, so the, um, you kind of alluded to complexity of ROS 2 in terms of the setup. Uh, I'm wondering if there were other like benefits and trade-offs that you considered for foregoing something like ROS and ROS 2 in that ecosystem. Oh yeah, like why not use ROS basically? Yeah. Well, there are a lot of reasons. Um, our robot is mostly programmed. So ROS is really good because like the nodes and stuff, right? So like the async, like the communication, but for our robot, we really don't have that many sensors and we really want to do this like model-based, like policy-based robot, so we don't have many complicated sensors that we need to like async communicate at all times. Um, the other part is like, we're, I'm pretty opinionated. I used to ROS 1 and ROS 2, Foxy and, uh, Noetic. Um, I've just had a pretty bad experience using it, having to set up Ubuntu, you know, like I just want a robot I can just buy, buy, open the box, it stands for walks, and then I can just start programming it using my computer. Yeah. Yeah. What, what kind of AI accelerator, kind of AI accelerator is on each of the robots? Yeah. So, um, basically for the K-Bot, it's going to be Jetson Nano and AGX. Yeah. So, yeah, there are different compute options you'll be able to choose when we launch. Yes. Yeah. Go ahead. Uh, so you can just put either VR headset. So there are a few different methods. So the preferred option for a lot of people's VR headset. We have this like, we also train like a pseudo IK. So basically it's like a going to position using like an RL model instead of just like calculating IK, but it works pretty well with our VR setup. So you can move the hand gestures, you can click buttons to open and close gripper and just, yeah, move your arm and stuff. Yes. Yeah, you'll be able to, it runs the exact same software stack. Yeah. Last question. How do you compare with Tesla? The Tesla humanoids, uh, in terms of like mechanical power, like, you know, the Tesla is way more powerful. It has like linear actuators and etc. But in terms of like actual use cases, I don't think it's really that different. Yeah. I mean, Tesla is actually built for like a factory type of, uh, use cases. But in terms of like, you want to for people to actually buy and use this robot, it's not very different. What's the price difference? Uh, I think the last time I heard, Tesla Optimus is about 60K at least. Um, we can ask some Tesla engineers, but, uh, our robot is $9,000 before mass production. [Music]",
