  "cleanText": "[Music]\nSo let me start with a question.\nHow does intelligence emerge in biological systems?\nRight?\nWell, it's through neurons, right?\nWhen neurons are born, they are just like individual cells.\nBut like over time, they grow their axons and dendrites and establish connections with other cells or other neurons and actually learn how to communicate in order to pursue their own interest, basically like to get nutrients and so on.\nAnd over time they learn how to communicate with each other and with other cells to get nutrients and basically thrive, right?\nAnd this collective behavior, if you like zoom out and look at like a really large number of them, uh, is something we call intelligence, right?\nSo it's like emerging behavior of smaller individual units that pursue their own interest.\nSo how does intelligence emerge in the markets, right?\nPeople always talk about markets like, \"Well, the market thinks that, the market uh, reacted to this,\" and so on.\nAnd in some way, uh, markets are more intelligent uh, than like individual like participants of the market, right?\nAnd it's there are mutual uh, interaction of these individual members of the market, basically, who pursue their own interest and communicate and establish new interactions with others, uh, where some sort of like collective intelligence, which is like bigger than the sum of different parts, emerges, right?\nSo how does intelligence emerge in companies?\nWell, this one is provocative: through Slack, right?\nWhere people interact and pursue their own interest uh, in the company, and over like altogether, the company, well, sometimes becomes more intelligent than the individual employees of the company.\nAnd uh, so this leads to my final question: so how or how will the general intelligence emerge in computing systems, right?\nAnd there is a lot of talk about AGI and like, you know, like ever larger models uh, exhibiting like super intelligent behavior, but in my opinion, the like general intelligence will actually emerge through interaction of multiple entities, can call them agents, basically like multiple models uh, pursuing their own goals, interacting with each other, and uh, altogether exhibiting something which we can call general intelligence.\nAnd thanks to uh, MCP, we finally have this uh, missing part that allows the agents to communicate with each other and really like create a fabric or agentic mesh where they can talk together.\nSo uh, hello everyone, my name is Jan Curn.\nI'm the founder of Apify, and uh, I'm going to talk about the race of the agentic economy on the shoulders of MCP, basically, an economy where agents uh, can, you know, find counterparts uh, to interact with and purchase services from other from businesses or tools or other agents, right?\nSo like B2A and B2B uh, sorry, and A2A.\nAll right, so before I start, um, let me just introduce quickly Apify.\nApify is a marketplace of 5,000 tools called actors, and uh, historically we come from the web scraping industry, right?\nSo most of these actors are data extraction tools that allow you, you know, to get data from social media, from search engines, uh, data for AI, for building rack pipelines, you know, uh, data from web uh, for lead generation and so on, but also there are other tools like data processing tools and so on.\nSo altogether there's about 5,000 of them, and some of them are built by Apify, some are built by our community of creators uh, who actually make money on it, right?\nSo it's like a marketplace of software creators, if you will, right?\nSo actors are self-contained pieces of software based on Docker with well-defined input and output, right?\nAnd basically they represent a new way how to ship software and publish it, you know, and uh, and integrate to, you know, other systems, right?\nSo for example, Google Map scraper, it's a quite popular actor uh, from our store, uh, it can extract data from Google Maps, right?\nUh, more data than than the Google Places API provides, right?\nWell, there is like creator of the actor, description, you know, different stats and so on.\nSomething you would expect from a normal marketplace.\nAnd actually, thanks to the way actors are built, it's actually super easy to integrate actors from other systems, right?\nRight.\nSo for example, we have SDKs for TypeScript, for Python, uh, for open API, uh, for C common, uh, for CLI, I mean, like we can call them from terminal, and it's only because they are well-defined units of software with input and output, right?\nUh, also we have integrations with uh, workflow automation tools like Mag, Zapier, you know, Clay, and many others.\nSo to make it really easy to call actors from these systems, right?\nBut obviously now uh, we also have MCP integration, which makes it possible to call actors from AI agents or, you know, AI workflows.\nAnd the way it works actually is uh, the agent just needs an API key or, you know, a workflow on an account on Apify, and then through our MCP server, basically, it can interact or call any of those 5,000 actors on our marketplace, right?\nAnd actually this only became possible thanks to uh, I would say the killer feature of MCP, which is the tool discovery, right?\nActually, um, not many clients didn't support this yet.\nUh, but uh, just just today I saw that VS Code added support for it.\nUh, and actually just like two days ago, for desktop added support for tool discovery.\nAnd basically how it works is that um, the client connects to the MCP server and dynamically discovers tools to use and to interact with based on the workflow, right?\nAnd let's say we have like 5,000 tools on our store, and there is simply no way we could publish all these tools through open API because, you know, the context would be just too large and like the more tools you have, the, you know, riskier the result is, right?\nSo we really want like provide the tools only like uh, as needed, and this is only possible through tool discovery, which I think is really the main thing that will actually make MCP really uh, the huge differentiator from from open API, for example, right?\nSo MCP actually quickly became a standard for agentic interaction.\nThis is Google Trends data showing that MCP is is basically dominating the space compared to open API or A2A from from Google, right?\nAnd actually I think MCP already became a standard for agenting interaction.\nAnd it became so popular that currently there are like, you know, many different like uh, registries of MCP servers that even guys from Master, our friends, created like registry of MCP server registries, right?\nJust to make the sense of it, right?\nAnd obviously Anthropic is also working on their own uh, registry, and um, I think Google's A2A, they have like a DNS-based protocol with like well-known agents JSON way to, you know, publish the services on through DNS.\nSo basically there is like, you know, so many different servers you can now use from the agents, right?\nSo does it mean with like so many tools now support MCP, so does it mean like the agents can discover and access any of them on their own, right?\nWell, not really, because to use those services, your agents still need uh, to have like API tokens to those services, right?\nSo even let's say if you use Zapier, MCMCP that provides access to like 5,000 apps they have in their marketplace, you still need to connect those individual apps to your services, right?\nYou know, like GitHub or Slack or, you know, whatever.\nSo, Zapier on the on its own is not able to provide access to the third-party services.\nYou still need to as a user to facilitate that.\nSo that actually means that uh, the agents are not able to like find counterparts uh, or like uh, other agents or other tools to interact with on their own.\nThey are still depending on the human uh, developer who actually build the system, right?\nWho kind of like give those those those agents access to different tools, right?\nAnd if those agents are, you know, to replace all the people and all the jobs, right?\nThey need to be able to uh, find services to interact with.\nThey can't just like, you know, do do that like it's like basic basic thing that like uh, anyone of us can do, right?\nLike to find a service and purchase it, right?\nSo I argue that like unless the the the agents are able to do that, uh, we will not be able to reach, you know, some higher level of of intelligence of these agentic systems and behaviors, basically, uh, if the agents cannot purchase services, right?\nSo how can we solve this problem, right?\nSo first, like sort of like n approach would be, let the agents subscribe themselves to the target services, right?\nSo basically in a way, like agents could have like email, maybe credit part, they could like fill, you know, the subscription flow, maybe solve the capture, you know, create an account and so on, but you see, it's it's not very practical, right?\nI mean, it's, you know, well, they might need to also have a phone number and so on, and quite often the services actually need to have like a real person behind the account, right?\nSo basically this this wouldn't really work, right?\nUh, so second solution uh, is central identity and payments provider.\nThere are like a couple of companies pursuing now that like there would be like a central authority where you and charge money and then the agents can use that, you know, to buy services and and provide them with their identity, right?\nFor example, Vertifier, Coinbase is now pushing their X42 standard, uh, I think Stripe is working on this, and Mastercard and Visa too, right?\nSo I think this this is going to happen eventually, but running launching a new payment system, it's extremely complicated, right?\nBecause you're facing like this chicken and egg problem of marketplaces, right?\nI think PayPal had to uh, pay like $100 million per month just to buy the market, uh, and like launching credit cards in the in the 70s was like incredible challenge, basically, because nobody was accepting those cards, so why would people use them and so on, right?\nSo I think this will happen, but it will be a long process, basically, to establish this, right?\nSo let me offer the third approach, and it's like through a centralized marketplace of MTP services, like a store, basically, where you just need one API token or one authentication, one account to to get access to all the other services, and basically it works the way that the developers who publish these tools, these actors, actually they provide their credit card and their account to the third-party service and basically publish it, add monetization to it, like how much does it cost to call the service, and then they are basically the owner of the service, and now they publish it on our marketplace, and suddenly it becomes available to the whole ecosystem of tools, and this way actually we can scale it rapidly and actually even without the target services knowing, right?\nSo basically this way the actor can run the code itself or wrap an external API or just publish an external MCP server because the MCP servers, they can be actually nested, you can have like one parent server that provides actions or tools of the like nested MCP servers, right?\nSo that's another like cool feature of FMCP, you can really build this sort of ecosystem, you know, if you can facilitate the payments and monetization, right?\nSo actors charges the user and then its developer gets the money and pays for the external service, and anyone can publish such a connector even without the target service knowing, right?\nSo time for demo.\nIt's not a live demo because the internet is super flaky here.\nSo what you can see here is Cloud for desktop uh, that has access to Apify MCP server, uh, there is like 18 tools available now, and I'm asking like, \"What is the venue of AI engineer world's fair in San Francisco?\"\nIt's possible to use actors, so it, you can see it searches the actors uh, for a tool that can answer this question.\nIt will find a tool or actor called Rag web browser, and so it's called, it's a, it's like a Google search with, you know, fetch data, so basically it asks the query like uh, \"What is the venue?\" and so on, and then it parses the the resulting page.\nSo we can see it found like uh, SF Marriott Maries, uh, that seems all correct, right?\nSo now let's use an actor for scraping Twitter.\nSo uh, this actor is not available in the context.\nSo so the agent doesn't know how to use it.\nSo it will it searches actors on our store and finds an actor that can scrape Twitter, right?\nSo it it calls it calls add actor, which is like a tool that adds a new tool to the context.\nUh, actually Cloud is very verbose describing a lot of things about it.\nAnd actually there is like a small bug still in Cloud escope that you need to like disable and enable a tool so that the the tool list refreshes and then the tools become available.\nI'm sure it's going to be fixed in the next release.\nAnd now let's use that actor to uh, get the last tweet of AI engineer conference.\nAll right.\nSo it calls the actor on Apify.\nUh, it knows the Twitter handle probably from from the website.\nAnd now you can see that uh, it found the result and the last tweet from this morning was uh, something about workshops.\nThat seems about right.\nSo now what?\nSo we we have we have seen how we can use existing tools in in in our store.\nBut like let's say uh, uh, one of our competitors, uh, a company called Browser Base.\nHey Paul, if you're here, uh, they certainly haven't published, you know, uh, an actor in our store, but we did.\nSo we created an account browser base, added our API token there and published like basically their MCP server on our store without actually them even knowing.\nAnd now anybody can actually use browserbased MCP through Apify's ecosystem, right?\nEven without them having to do anything or knowing about it, right?\nSo now let's use browser base to fill in the email subscription form on the AI engineer website.\nFill email yan@apify.com.\nAnd now let's see what happens, right?\nAnd actually we'll see that uh, that the that the agent will actually call browserbased MCP through, you know, an actor published, published, you know, by us on our Apify store and perform the actions on the web, right?\nAnd actually this way we can easily like uh, bring a lot of lot of existing MCP servers to our store and, you know, expand the ecosystem rapidly without, you know, having to ask for the cooperation of the third parties, right?\nSo that's actually what we're doing now.\nUh, we want to scale this marketplace rapidly and now, okay, so now it's evaluating, you know, the screenshots, looking for the field and so on, you know, and eventually it will manage to uh, fill the form and and basically succeed in the task, right?\nI can maybe skip this uh, to save time.\nIt takes some some some time to basically uh, for the agent to to find the form and so on.\nBut uh, yeah, it succeeded.\nIt completed the email sub subscription.\nAnd this way you basically see that uh, you can plug our our ecosystem of actors into into uh, any AI agents that actually support tool discovery, right?\nAll right.\nAnd so this means now anyone can publish tools or, you know, agents on Apify store and monetize them and immediately get access, you know, to all the AI clients that already like integrated Apify and all the ecosystem of tools, right?\nAnd actually people can make make money on it.\nLike just last month we paid more than $4 million to our creators, and actually the the this number is is growing rapidly.\nYou know, overall the actors generate more than one half million dollars per month.\nNow, uh, we have like 1 million monthly visitors to the whole ecosystem.\nAnd now we're really in the process of like scaling this ecosystem.\nSo, um, if you're looking for ways to monetize your tools or agents, you know, just um, talk to us and publish on Apify store and get access to this ecosystem of developers and this visibility.\nAnd there are some open questions obviously uh, that remain.\nSo will this autonomous through discovery provide real value?\n\n\nI mean, like, everybody who builds agentic systems knows that, you know, like, making sure that the system works as expected is tricky, right, even if it's fixed.\nSo, if we add this, like, you know, variables that, like, well, uh, if the agents can discover new tools, uh, will it actually work?\nWell, currently, it might, it might be a bit flaky, right?\nI think we're still, still, we, we're still fairly early, but as the models get better, I think, uh, even with the discovery, suddenly the, the, the agents will be, will be able to provide, you know, valuable and reliable results, basically, right?\nSo this is, this remains to be seen, but I'm optimistic that, like, as the LMs will get better, we'll actually get there, that the tool discovery will actually provide real value.\nWell, there's a big question of, like, how can agents trust tools or other tools?\nOh, so sorry.\nOr each other, right?\nWe know it, like, you only interact with people you trust.\nSo, how can agents do that?\nWe'll see.\nAnd can autonomous agent interaction enable AGI?\nWell, we'll see.\nThank you very much for your attention and, uh, feel free to try it.\nMCP.I.com.\n[Music]\n",
