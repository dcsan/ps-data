  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nFor a show of hands, how many people in this audience know who Circle is? What we do? Um, just trying to gauge. Okay. Okay. Um, do you know anything about our developer tooling? Gotcha. Gotcha. So, nobody. Okay. So, this is good. All right.\n\nUm, first, you know, I just want to introduce myself. Uh, my name is Corey Cooper. I lead DevRel at Circle. Uh, this talk is about the intersection of some exploratory work we've been doing internally between AI and programmable money. And um, you know, one of the things we noticed, a trend in with USDC, uh, when Circle launched its digital dollar technology, is that um, it was an order of a magnitude better at doing escrow than traditional payment rails. And so, uh, combining USDC with AI gives you a way to do some type of verification of, uh, workflows that are, uh, happening that need to be met in order for an escrow agreement to be, uh, honored. And then you get instant settlement with, uh, a stable coin that can settle um, faster than T plus 2 around the world.\n\nSo, in this presentation, what we'll do is I'll give you a background on Circle. I'll give you an overview of our developer tooling. Then we'll jump into our smart contract um, that powers USDC, the technology that makes it a programmable dollar, and uh, and gives it features and attributes that you can't do with, uh, a digital representation of a dollar in traditional payment rails. And then we'll end off with giving a live demo of our escrow agent application that we open sourced recently, and um, allow you all to set this up in your environment if you want to locally. I can walk you through doing that today, or we can just do a Q&A. You can ask some questions about um, you know, anything about, you know, our dev tooling and and where we see this marriage between agents and USDC going.\n\nSo, just to give you a quick um, background about Circle, um, it's a fintech company um, that issues stable coins. Um, we were established in 2013. Um, and some of our backers are the pillars in the financial services industry like BlackRock and Fidelity. The reason for that is because we've done uh, a really good job of providing trust and transparency that the digital tokenized version of the US dollar or the euro that we deploy on different blockchain networks is backed one to one with fiat uh, and short-term treasuries in a bank account. So it's fully reserved 100%. We also have led the charge in regulation around this industry and really helped um, regulators around the world think about this as a groundbreaking technology for payments, and um, as you see, there's some things that are happening in the US and across the world where um, laws are being passed to regulate stable coins, which we're happy about because it's going to give businesses and individuals opportunity to take advantage of this technology.\n\nAnd so, um, another note is, um, you know, since inception, we've been able to, uh, be responsible for settling over 26 trillion of transactions on, um, roughly, we're on roughly 20 different blockchains and going right now. But um, that that's a huge accomplishment for uh, the amount of engineering resources, the product resources, marketing resources that the company has poured into to, you know, allowing businesses and individuals to be able to take advantage of this technology and build on top of it as a payment rail.\n\nSo, here is a um, a chart, or not really a chart, it's an overview slide, a visual of the lay of the land of what we offer as a company.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, um, you know, we issue USDC and EURC.\n\nUm, we recently acquired a company called Hashnote where we now have a tokenized version of a money market fund. Um, which is going to give us the ability to do um, something with money markets that were never possible before. Uh, to be able to liquidate out of a money market into USDC 24/7, 365 days a week. Um, and then we have our liquidity services for uh, payment service providers, financial institutions, uh, where we enable them to be able to mint and redeem USDC um, to a very secure enterprise-grade vault wallet on chain for uh, performing different types of use cases that relate to payments, um, dollar access, as well as uh, capital markets.\n\nAnd on the far right, we have our developer services. And this portion of um, of what we offer is what will be wrapped into what we will demonstrate today with the sample app that I'll demo, uh, where comprises of wallets. So, well, a developer can embed wallets in their application programmatically.\n\nWe also have uh, Circle contracts. So, that's a smart contract platform that enables you to deploy uh, contracts programmatically and read to those contracts as well as write.\n\nAnd then uh, under that, we have our Circle Pay Master and CCTP. And if anybody knows anything about transacting on public blockchain networks, there is something called gas fees. And so what we've done is we've enabled um, end users to be able to pay for gas fees within USDC. So from the USDC balance. So it actually feels like a traditional payment transaction as opposed to having some native token that you always have to have in your wallet to be able to transact. And then since we're on all these blockchain networks, there is a lot of fragmentation that we were trying to unify. And the way we unify that is with our cross-chain transfer protocol that allows for you to move USDC between different blockchain networks permissionlessly. And you as a developer can build very seamless multi-chain experiences around this protocol um, so that you don't have fragmentation where someone is on one chain and they can't transact on another chain. So you can do cross-chain transactions, uh, and things like that.\n\nAnd at the bottom layer are uh, all the blockchains that we natively have USDC issued on. Uh, this list is getting longer. Um, so, but you know, we are in a multi-chain world where we want USDC to be the premier digital dollar, and so we are building all types of on-chain uh, utility around USDC as well as ERC to make uh, this um, you know, support for multiple blockchains more unified. So there will be some other innovations that we're going to release in the next couple of weeks and months um, that advance the unification of balances across multiple blockchain networks with our um, stable coin technology.\n\nSo let's dive into USDC, um, and just really talk about the attributes that are really important to a developer. And so um, one of the things is, you know, it is a dollar that is internet native. And so what that means is the ledger of that dollar is built into internet technology, which is blockchain networks and smart contracts. And so it enhances the programmability, the transferability, um, to enable money to move in seconds globally. And so it's not constricted to some of the uh, friction points we have in legacy payment rails.\n\nThe other thing is because it's uh, native to the internet, it's it has no borders. Um, so it works like email or text where, you know, you can send text or email around the world. We want to make money to be that seamless to be able to transact with. And so um, because of it being issued on public blockchain networks, it gives it the borderless uh, freedom to be able to transact globally.\n\nAnd then last, when you have a network that is permissionless and public and open, uh, it makes it very easy for other companies, individuals to plug into this actual network of money um, and transact with it. And so um, it's scaling very fast globally because of the openness of anybody being able to build on top of this protocol for sending and receiving and storing uh, value.\n\nAnd so how does this work? You know, uh, how it works is how USDC gets issued in the ecosystem is a business gets approved by Circle to set up a business account, and then they connect their bank account to our Circle Mint platform, and they wire their fiat to our reserve bank account. After that, that fiat settles as USD in our bank account, then we mint the corresponding amount of USDC and credit their Circle Mint account.\n\nAnd so that is how USDC gets issued in the ecosystem. Now the reverse process happens when the business wants to get out of USDC. They can redeem, uh, and there's a one-to-one with um, every USDC minted to a US dollar. So um, when they want to get out, um, they get that one-to-one parity, and so that is the trust and transparency that we provide to our customers. Uh, we also um, do a little bit of extra things, and you can go on our website where we have a USDC transparency page where you can go and see our monthly attestations. Um, and we have various auditors um, that are independent of the company that continue to audit and make sure that we are fully reserved and we, you know, make sure we ensure the trust and transparency around the actual issuance of a digital representation of the dollar on chain.\n\nSo now we're going to jump into the USDC smart contract and really dive into like what makes this programmable, how does it work.\n\nSo one thing is, uh, we have um, you know, very strict implementation requirements before we uh, deploy USDC on a different blockchain network. And so, um, here are the things that we want to make sure that we can incorporate in the token contract before deploying it on a blockchain network just to make sure we have standardization across the board. Um, you know, as we um, expand to different blockchain ecosystems, but also too, to make sure that there are safeties, uh, provisions that we have built into this actual smart contract for businesses and individuals to be able to trust and use our technology as a protocol for money movement globally.\n\nAnd so um, here are some of the things I'll jump into and and and provide a little bit more clarity around the implementation requirements. But um, the first is um, allow list and block list. And so this enables us to basically protect, you know, um, people who use our token contract from bad actors. And so if we know someone's on a sanction list, um, you know, and and they're a malicious actor, we have the ability to actually um, stop them from transacting and protect other users from transacting with that actual user. And so um, it's built in for safety for businesses.\n\nAnd then we have um, spend on behalf. And so that's a feature where, you know, say if you're a business and you wanted to create a financial workflow where you wanted to enable um, you know, somebody to spend uh, a certain amount of money from a wallet balance, uh, and and give them a cap on that on a daily basis. Um, there is functionality built into it where you can delegate for uh, a user to be able to spend a certain amount of money from a actual wallet balance using USDC. Yeah.\n\nLike is a scenario with that like a corporate um, you know, corporate account or something like corporate business card? So say if you have some virtual debit cards that you're issuing to your actual uh, employees, and the actual debit card is powered by a USDC balance in a wallet. You could design basically a workflow where you could put thresholds on how much they could spend from that corporate card. Would you realistically be able to run that to like thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or would that not be a proper use case? No, no, you could scale it up. Yeah. Oops, sorry. You could, you could definitely scale that that delegation of spending um, for that fat wallet address with a virtual debit card uh, to tens of thousands. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnother is is mentor configuration. And so um, you know, we we have the ability to uh, add um, you know, other uh, entities to be able to uh, mint from our token contract. This is something that we haven't done, but there could be a future where we could partner with financial institutions and they have a balance that they can mint from from the actual token contract.\n\nAnd then uh, multi-sig transactions. Um, this is this is for, you know, like if you're building some type of workflow where maybe you require the CEO, CFO, and CFO to actually sign off on transactions that are above a certain threshold, you can design these type of um, transactional experiences to protect from um, you know, a wallet being drained um, based off of like one person having total control of, you know, the the transaction ability of that wallet.\n\nCoal storage support, um, a use case for this is where maybe, you know, that um, you're running payroll uh, on a monthly basis using USDC for your employees. You know the date and time that you're going to be sending money out. You know the amount. Um, you have the ability to to put those transactions in a ready state that are offline. And so when that date and time comes, it's ready. The transaction object has already been approved and signed, and then you can just broadcast that to the actual uh, blockchain network to send that off. So it allows you to kind of prepare transactions offline.\n\nIs that proof of funds? Um, uh, transactions so that it's ensure that the money is there when the time comes. It, it could be designed for that. Uh, but it's more, it's more of you have a cadence of transactions that you know are going to happen on, you know, a bi-weekly or monthly basis, and you want to make sure that that transaction is already ready to go, uh, and in a state where it's already been signed and approved for, and then it can just be broadcasted at a later date. So it doesn't necessarily prevent it from bouncing. Uh, no, no. Yeah.\n\nAnd then since this is a new concept of money, um, and we're constantly, you know, thinking about ways of how we can enhance the actual protocol of money movement, there are times where we need to pause the contract for upgrading it. And so this hasn't been done much, but the most recent one was uh, um, about two years ago, a year and a half to two years ago. And um, you know, it's USDC version 2.2. And the main thing that we did was we um, made it more gas efficient. And so um, knowing that we want to make this technology scalable, we want to make sure that gas fees never become an issue. And so we were able to design different uh, functionality in the token contract to optimize for uh, better gas performance across chains.\n\nAnd so now I'll jump into the um, contract functions of USDC.\n\nAnd so these are uh, basically the functions, the core functions that a developer would plug into when um, commonly transacting with USDC. And you have uh, balance of, total supply, allowance, transfer, transfer from, and approve. And so these are these are um, you know, functions that are built into the actual smart contract that powers USDC, uh, that you'll see actually later on when I do the demo that we'll be using to actually uh, perform the actual escrow transaction. And so um, one of the the the most commonly used uh, functions from this actual contract list is uh, transfer from. And so uh, in that argument, you see you put the uh, from address and the to address and then amount, and you pass that um, and then that gets broadcasted to the actual block blockchain network to be able to actually send that transaction, and you're you're telling it to send basically money from this account to\n\n\nThat account. And then the amount of\nUSDC that you want to send. And so that\nthat's the programmability that you get\nwith USDC that is not built into the\ndigital representation of fiat in a\ndatabase. And so that's where the magic\nallows you as developers in the room to\ncreate these very innovative\nexperiences that were not available to\nus.\nAnd so, USDC is, it's kind of funny,\nbut it's designed for agents. Basically\nhow we've seen agents kind of proliferate\nover the last year or so, it seems like\nit's just the perfect currency for an\nagent to use to transact. And so, some\nof the reasons why is, one, you get near\ninstant settlement and built-in\nverification of transactions. And so\nwhen an agent is transacting, it's not a\nhuman. And so one thing you want to do\nis you want to allow the agent to be\nable to transact, and those agents, if\nthey're doing agent-to-agent payments,\nthey want near instant settlement\nbecause these are robots transacting.\nAnother thing is you don't want robots\nto have to deal with chargebacks. And so\nthat could be a nightmare because when\nagents start transacting with each other,\nmoney is going to flow very fast. And so\na chargeback could be a catastrophic\nrisk to running agent-to-agent payments\non reversible rails.\nThe other thing is agents are always on,\nand so they need a payment rail that's\nalways on, 24/7, no banking hours. And\nso the great thing about this public\nblockchain infrastructure is you have\nthis compute that's always on that\nenables settlement to happen 24/7\nglobally with no banking hours. And all\nof these transactions are verifiable\nthrough private and public key\ntechnology. And so the cryptography and\nthe actual openness of these actual\necosystems make it a perfect payment\nrail for agents to transact because\nthere's no downtime.\nOops. Let's go back. And then the last\nthing is I'll go back to the slide where\nI was showing the actual contract\nfunctions. It's the programmability.\nAgents are going to need to be able to\nhave a lot of programmability because\nthere are going to be transactions where\nthey'll need to be able to perform some\nsort of logic that they need to pass\nbefore they can actually make that\ntransaction. And so that logic can\nactually be built into composable smart\ncontracts that we'll show in this demo\nof how this is great for escrow because\nyou have the ability to perform value\ntransfer with all this conditional logic\nthat you can actually program in, and\nthe agent can actually interact with\nthat logic to be able to perform those\ntransactions. So, very powerful\ntechnology here.\nAnd so, now I'll jump into the sample\napp. And so, first I'll run through kind\nof the architecture, what we used, and\nhow it works. And then we'll jump into a\ndemo of it, and then everybody can have\ntime to actually set it up in their own\nenvironment, and I can walk around and\nhelp you out if you have any issues.\nSo the core building blocks from a dev\ntooling standpoint of what we used to\nbuild this actual escrow flow is we use\nCircle wallets, and so that enabled us\nto actually provision wallets for the\nagent, the user, and the two parties\ninvolved in the actual escrow process.\nAnd then also, we use Circle contracts.\nSo we were able to actually, we wrote a\nsolidity contract, and then we deployed\nthat using the Circle contracts API. So\nit was a repeatable process of us\ndeploying contracts for each actual\ngroup of parties that are transacting.\nAnd so that API allowed for us to take\nthis template of a escrow contract in\nsolidity and repeatedly deploy it and\nuse it for different parties involved\ntransacting amongst each other. And then\nlastly, USDC, being able to embed the\nUSDC stablecoin in the actual smart\ncontract gave us the ability to design\nbasically a smart contract that is\nrunning off of dollars and interoperable\nwith the actual fiat world as well\nbecause the likely process of some of\nthis will be there's an onramping\nexperience from fiat to USDC, and then\nthere's an off-ramping experience where\nthe beneficiary wants to go back to\nactual fiat, and using the actual smart\ncontract in USDC gives both parties the\ntrust that they have a tokenized version\nof the dollar that they know they can\nget in and out of anytime one to one.\nSo here's kind of how the onboarding\nflow works. As you can see from this\ndesign, you have a client, which is the\nbusiness and the freelancer, and they\nboth come to a platform and create an\naccount. And so as they create an\naccount, in the background, there's an\nAPI call to the Circle APIs that\nprovisions a wallet for each of those\nactual parties.\nAnd then the next thing is the actual\nbusiness will take basically a PDF\nversion of an agreement that they have\nwith that actual freelancer that they\nprobably negotiated outside of the\nplatform for this use case. And then\nthey would upload that agreement, and\nwhat would happen is once they upload\nthat agreement to the platform, it would\npass it to the OpenAI API and run it\nthrough a multimodal model to actually\nparse out information about the actual\nagreement, and so that information will\nbe related to the amount that these two\nparties have agreed upon as far as the\nwork is concerned, and then the summary\nof task has that need to be delivered in\norder for the actual escrow to be\ncompleted and payout to happen. And so\nafter that happens, basically there's a\nlisting on the platform that the AI\nagent generates and lists, and there's a\nhuman in the loop in this process where\nthe actual business approves that, hey,\nthis is the amount I'd agreed upon.\nThis is the list of things that need to\nbe done in order to honor the agreement\nand receive payout, and this is a good\nsummary of what the agreement is about.\nSo I want to publish that listing to the\nplatform, and then after that happens,\nthen the actual business would need to\ncreate a smart contract. And so since\nwe've already got a template running in\nthe background, they're not designing\nthat smart contract themselves. What it\nis doing is it's taking the information\nthat the agent has parsed out from the\nactual contractual agreement and\ninitializing certain constructor\nvariables for the actual smart contract\nto be in a ready state to be deployed on\nchain to govern the rules of the actual\nagreement. And so those things are just\nsimple things right now. It's just use\nUSDC as the stablecoin of choice for the\ncurrency that flows through. Also, the\nagent will be given a wallet that can\nonly be used to actually release funds\nfrom the contract. And then who is the\ndepositor wallet and who is the\nbeneficiary wallet. And so those rules\nwill be enforced within the smart\ncontract before it's deployed on chain.\nAnd so after, so to deploy it on chain,\nwe're using the Circle APIs for this.\nAnd so after that is deployed on chain,\nthere's a notification that comes on\nthe screen telling the actual business\nthat the contract has been deployed\nsuccessfully. And in the background, a\ndeveloper can use the developer console\nthat we have at Circle to track all this\nactivity and to design web hook\nnotifications as well around this\nactivity. And so that's one of the\npowers of our dev console. Allow for\nyou to do a lot with onchain data\nbecause we're indexing all this\ninformation and putting it in a nice\nformat to allow you to design different\nprogrammable flows around that\ninformation that's happening on chain.\nAnd so once the actual contract has been\ndeployed on chain, the next thing is\nyou're going to have to, the business\nwill have to actually on-ramp into USDC,\nor if they have pure USDC, then they can\nfund that actual contract from some\nUSDC they already have in an external\nwallet. And so, you will deposit, you'll\ncall the actual deposit function on the\nsmart contract. And what that would do\nis that would basically initiate an\napproval for a certain amount of USDC to\nbe swept from your actual wallet\naddress and transferred into the smart\ncontract so that the smart contract can\ngo into a ready state of letting the\nbeneficiary know funds have been\ndeposited in the smart contract. Now\nit's ready for you to do the work you\nneed to do to honor the contract. And\nso that's that's one, you know, magical\nmoment where you have now in this escrow\nexperience a smart contract that's\nactually holding the money in code, and\nthere is some sort of transparency that\nyou know the money actually is there\nbecause you're dealing with these\npublic networks that have the ability to\nverify that information by just looking\nit up on the block explorer to be able\nto see that, okay, funds are actually\nin this smart contract. So I know this\nperson's serious about paying me. So\nafter that, then the actual freelancer\nwill, and for this actual experience, we\nuse an image. The task at hand was to\ndesign basically some marketing\nmaterial in the format of an image that\nhad certain things within that image\nthat promoted the brand of the actual\nbusiness. And so freelancer uploads that\nimage to the platform. It passes it off\nto OpenAI, and the agent goes to work,\nand it looks and verifies. Okay, does\nthis image have all the things in it\nthat were required of it in the actual\ntask agreement? If it does, then it'll\ngo through a simple scoring system, and\nif that system scores it as, you know,\nits confidence level high, that means,\nokay, yes, release funds from the actual\nsmart contract, and then the agent can\nuse its wallet to actually call a\nrelease funds function within the smart\ncontract that will ultimately release\nfunds to the beneficiaries wallet. And\nso this is where the automation, the\nverification happens, where in most\nescrow situations, there's a lot of\nconvoluted back-end office work where\nmanual review is being done, and agents\nnow are getting to the point where\nthey're very good at reading, seeing,\nhearing, doing a lot of things. And so\nwhat we think is there could be a future\nwhere agents could be a major checkpoint\nin a lot of escrow transactions, and\ncoupled with USDC becoming a great way to\nsettle escrow transactions instantly,\nwhen you combine all this together, you\ncan build some very cool stuff together.\nYeah. So I did a lot of talking. Let me\nshow the demo because I know people want\nto see that. So let me get out of here\nand open up my app.\nOkay.\nAll right. Let's see.\nAll right. Can everyone see this? Okay.\nOkay. All right. Thanks. Okay. So,\nhere's the escrow agent app. I'm already\nlogged in.\nAnd I have some transactions that I've\nalready set up because I wanted to show\nyou what things look like in each state.\nAnd then I'll kind of walk through\ncertain transactions and get to the\nactual cool part of actually letting the\nagent actually release funds. But here's\na transaction I've staged, and right now\nit's in the initiated status. And so\nthis status is someone has already\nuploaded a contract in PDF form to the\nplatform. It's parsed out the\ninformation with the agent using the 40\nmini model, and then that human in the\nloop process of approving that, hey,\nthis is what the agreement should look\nlike listed on the platform so that the\nbeneficiary can receive that listing.\nAnd so this is the state of what it\nlooks like after you get past that. So,\nit's showing you the summary of the\nagreement. Obviously, it has the amount\nhere of $10. And then here are some of\nthe deliverables. High-quality image,\nyou know, featuring Sparkle Fizzle. So\nthat's the brand, fictitious company we\ncreated. And and so this is what it'll\nlook like before a smart contract is\ndeployed to govern the rules of an\nactual agreement.\nNow in this state, say I clicked deploy\nsmart contract on chain. It has now\nbuilt out the logic and the rules that\nwill govern this agreement. The next\nthing is, you know, depositing funds in\nthe smart contract. So the actual\nbeneficiary knows that, you know, this\nperson's serious. The money is there.\nIt's time for me to go to work and do\nthe things so I can receive the money.\nThis is what state will look like. And\nthen if you hit this button, you can\ndeposit funds, and it will withdraw the\n$10 amount from your account balance,\nand it'll deposit it in the actual\nsmart contract and provide a\nnotification of when that money has\nsettled in the actual smart contract.\nAnd then once it's, you know, in the\nsmart contract, the state will move to\nlocked. And so that means the smart\ncontract will lock itself. And now the\nnext thing that can happen in that smart\ncontract is basically the agent\nactually reviewing the work and\ninteracting with it to either release\nthe funds or revert the actual funds\nback to the actual depositor if you\nknow a period of time elapses where you\nknow that person was never able to kind\nof meet the agreement.\nSo what I'll do now is let me run\nthrough a test transaction.\nOkay. So let's see\ndesign.\nSo, here's a PDF document. Going to\nupload it.\nLet's see.\nAll right. So, in the background, the\nagent was running, parsing out the\ninformation in the PDF document. Again,\nit's parsed out the amount and the task.\nAnd so, if I hit continue, what it's\ngoing to do is it's going to generate\nthat listing on the platform.\nSo, we've got our web hook working. It's\npassing updates\nto make sure\nAnd let me do a refresh so that listing\nwill show.\nYeah. Okay. Yep. So that's the listing.\nAnd so now\nwhat we want to do is we want to create\na smart contract. So because it has all\nthe information that it needs to\nactually create this agreement now on\nchain. So we hit create smart contract.\nWhat it's doing now is calling the\nCircle APIs to actually deploy that\ncontract on chain. So\nmay take a little time but\nit should work in a few minutes. Let's\nsee.\nYeah.\nActually, great question. The network\nI'm using is base. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nNo, no, no. I mean is is a great\npartner. But we support a lot of\ndifferent chains.\nYeah. Let me see, taking a little time.\nI got a follow. Can you do an escrow\ncrosschain or does it have to be single?\nUm yeah, you actually can perform\ncrosschain extra escrow experiences.\nYou can use our crosschain transfer\nprotocol to do that. So I'll give you\nan example of how maybe that would look\nis\n\n\nIt's more of, uh, maybe a cross-chain deposit. So maybe someone comes to the platform and the contracts are on Base, but their USDC is on Solana, and so they want to deposit from Solana USDC to Base. They can send it over the cross-chain transfer protocol, CCTP, right? And then it will deposit into that Base contract. And then if the beneficiary says, \"Hey, you know, like I'm not on Base, I'm on, you know, another chain, Ethereum. I want it on Ethereum,\" then you can do cross-chain, you know, payout from that contract.\n\nOh, so it's not actually part of the contract. Right. Right. So, so usually what we've seen as developers who are building, um, cross-chain experiences where they're dealing with smart contracts, escrow, uh, a lot of them pick like one chain where the actual contracts will live, and then they build interoperability between like deposit and payout flows. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, let's see.\n\nMe go here to the... oops, wrong one.\n\n[Music]\n\nLet's see something. Okay. So, yeah, it's working. It's pending. It's just taking some time, little latency here to actually deploy the contract. Um, so these are different contracts I deployed testing it. So this based upon your... let's see. Actually, what I'm going to do, let me, let me show this cool video so you all can see like end-to-end really quickly because there is, you know, some sort of, uh, latency around the internet in here. So, I'll play this video right quick so you guys can see it in the inflow of like how it works.\n\nAnd so another thing, too, um, is, you know, you don't have to worry about gas with these, uh, with using our tooling because you can design these experiences, and then we have built-in gas abstraction with our wallet, uh, as a service infra, um, and so it enables you to really abstract away kind of dealing with, you know, holding native tokens for gas. And so we also, uh, make it very easy for, you know, as we're abstracting the gas away, obviously there's a cost there, but we make it easy for you to actually, uh, pay for your gas fees from fiat, um, directly from a debit card that you would or a credit card that you put on file. Um, but we, we really have, uh, designed this for, you know, enterprises, um, that, you know, probably aren't web3 native to be able to integrate our technology, take advantage of the near instance settlement that comes with public blockchain networks and manage wallets and transactions at a scalable level to be able to, um, you know, expand their, their actual footprint of payments around in the world.\n\nSo, um, the last thing I have is, um, deploying the contracts. Yeah. Yeah. You, you can actually deploy like a contract factory, uh, and then that'll allow you to kind of create iterations of that within the contract factory to be more efficient on the gas. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSo in the mechanics of what you're doing is that first step basically taking the an unstructured document and you creating basically structured data to then feed to the Circle API in terms of, and I guess how does that piece work? Is it as as simple as like feeding the contract to open API and just doing a little prompting to kind of get the structured data you want as far as the JSON format? Yeah, I'll jump into this right quick for you. So, okay.\n\nSo, yeah, that first, um, part is, you know, we've created a prompt to make sure it outputs it in JSON. So, it parses things out, outputs it in kind of a JSON format that looks like this. Uh, and then, uh, that's how we're able to kind of feed it through to be able to, um, create basically that listing that adheres to, uh, a consistent format of, of, um, showing the actual transaction, um, amount and task. I'm not super familiar with escrow contracts. Are they fairly standardized or they come in different forms? And I guess how, uh, robust has it been able to be in terms of handling different, uh, formats?\n\nYeah. So, um, here's the actual solidity code. I'll show you, uh, for the actual escrow contract here. Uh, and it, this is a very simple one. Um, it's only like a couple hundred lines, uh, and a few functions. They can get, uh, very robust. But if you're, um, for most, for most escrow, um, you know, experiences, uh, this could cover a lot, you know, for most escrow experiences, and there are a lot of templates out there, um, since escrow has been a big thing in the actual crypto ecosystem, um, that you can use. One, um, is, is one that, um, our research team worked on. It's called the refund protocol. Uh, I'll pull it up right now, but it's a, it's an escrow template that kind of gives you all the robustness you would probably need to handle, um, any type of escrow scenario, uh, that that has been prevalent in the ecosystem. Let me pull it up right now. And, um, you could actually use that, uh, and as a template and, and, you know, add to it if you want or just use it straight out of the box.\n\nSo let me show you this one.\n\n[Music]\n\nYeah, here it is, right here. So if you go to Circle research, uh, this is an article about it, and it kind of explains, you know, the functionality built into it. But also, too, we have a repo. Um, it is... where is this repo? Refund protocol. So yeah, this one right here. You could use this as a template. Yeah.\n\nCan you just wait for the microphone so everybody could hear you? Hold on one second. Thank you.\n\nOkay. Um, so my, my question here is, uh, towards the challenges of minimizing human intervention. Um, I, I find, uh, LM and agents, um, sometimes unreliably non-deterministic, right? So there is always this pattern of, um, the LM or the agent builds like a plan, and someone reviews to approve. Um, given the nature of, um, your business, right? I, I understand that. Like, I guess the question here is like, what are, for Circle AI, the biggest challenges when you talk about minimizing human interaction using...\n\nYeah, great, great question. Um, so the question here is, you know, what, what is, um, the challenges with minimizing interactions with payments as it relates to Circle? Um, so I think that, um, our focus as our company is kind of like creating more of a frictionless exchange of value using public blockchain networks for settlement, right? But we started to see a huge trend, uh, over a year ago where, uh, a lot of developers were building agentic workflows using USDC is the payment rail of choice to transact between agents and agents. And so, um, what we, we think is, um, obviously there, um, the, the one thing about, you know, um, AI is it's not deterministic, and payments are deterministic. Uh, you want them to be deterministic, but there is a lot of conditional logic that is happening before payments are being released in the world. And so, um, what, what I think is right now the best, safest way to design these experiences is with human in the loop built into it. Um, and, and, and really kind of focus on it doing, being just a pure review, basically, for a person in a actual, um, payment operation, uh, job to be able to have just something else out there that is doing work 24/7 and saying, \"Hey, here are a list of payments that are ready to go, and this is what we've analyzed and why we believe it's ready to go,\" but at the end, end of the day, like you're the final approver. Uh, and so that's what we think, um, you know, in the near future, combining these technology together, uh, it can be a great combination, but autonomously and just, you know, full automation of controlling, um, sending and receiving payments, I'm not sure we're there right now. Uh, but I will say that, um, you know, the way this AI industry is moving, um, there could be a world, you know, 5 to 10 years from now where, um, people actually trust these agents to autonomously handle, um, payments, um, and procurement and things like that. So hopefully that answers your question.\n\nYeah, but we're, we're in the first inning of this, and to be completely transparent, you know, there's people in this room who have a lot of experience building with agents. Um, this is designed to inspire you all to like test out the combination of this technology and, and, and give us feedback, too. Uh, we're learning alongside. Oh. Oh.\n\nUm, I missed the first part, but what's the closest real-life examples you have of this autonomous work evaluation and settlement? Do you have any kind of real-life examples you can share? Yeah. Um, so we, we haven't released any anything that's like in production doing this, but there are companies that are doing this right now in production. Um, and that is, you know, you have Crossmit is one company, uh, and then another company is, um, Third Web with Nebula, uh, their model. So those companies are kind of, you know, on the bleeding edge of of offering these experiences to developers, but also kind of, you know, putting things out themselves. So I'd encourage you to check out those two companies. They're both, uh, Crossman's headquartered in New York, I think, and, uh, Third Webb is right down the street here in the Bay. Yeah. Yeah. Um, hi. Um, I have a question regarding like around the escrow transactions. So I wanted to know how feasible, uh, is it to implement Jon proof, um, in this blockchain-based escrow transactions?\n\nYeah. Um, that, that is, um, that's something that is, is pretty feasible with the advancements that we've seen with, um, proving TLS notary communications. Um, those a little bit lighter weight to prove, and you can generate a proof faster and pass that to a smart contract to be able to, um, perform, uh, escrow. Uh, so there is a company called ZKP P2P that actually is experimenting with this, and it's a live experiment that is working really well. So, um, there are different ways you could, you could design these and integrate ZK proofs into them, um, that we've seen, and, and ZKP is one of them that has done it pretty well. Yeah, great question. Yeah, thank you. I have, sorry, I have another question as well. So, uh, could you go to the slide where the, uh, implementation thing is there for the cold storage support?\n\nOkay, let's see. So here I have a doubt, like, um, so yes, in this, like, transactions should not all, uh, always be instantaneous. So you should be like creating ahead of time and broadcast next month, right? So I'm not sure, like, I, I haven't done, like, if is there a possibility if, like, uh, there might be a double-spending kind of attack if we, like, hold, uh, the transaction and it is not spontaneous.\n\nUm, so the, the question is, could actually, uh, generating an offline transaction that's approved create a double-spending, uh, exploit? Is that, that, that the question? Um, yes. Uh, um, I don't think it could, could necessarily do that. Um, you know, from, from my experience of, of people actually kind of generating transactions offline to actually broadcast later, I haven't seen that that issue become, uh, a problem with double spending. Oh. Oh, no. And like, uh, could you like little bit, uh, explain me the scenario of like how transactions should not always be instantaneous like around this? So, so this, this use case of me, maybe if you are a company and you're running payroll on chain, and, um, you know that, um, there is a transaction that you're going to make in the future, um, for a certain amount to do payroll, and it's on a consistent cadence. You could actually, uh, generate that transaction, sign it and approve it offline, and then broadcast it on the day of the actual transaction that needs to be sent out. Oh, got it. Thank you. Yeah. Okay.\n\nHey, how's it going? Good. How you doing? I must have missed the first part where you mentioned multi-sig, but, um, my question was just revolving around like some of the different use cases of multi-sig, combining that with, you know, humans, agents, um, you know, for example, in this, um, contract evaluation, you could have like three different agents try to evaluate the same contract and criteria inside of multi-sig, but what other, what other use cases of multi-sig and AI do you see?\n\nGreat question. Um, you know, I, I think that, um, you know, there could be a world where, um, you, like, you, you have multiple agents that may act as, um, you know, in, in kind of like a, a financial, uh, operations unit at a company, small company, and you may have, um, you know, a CFO agent, a controller agent, accountant agent, and those agents are cross-checking each other's work and things like that. But then ultimately, they need to do, uh, some sort of multi-signature process to be able to sign off on, uh, maybe transactions that are over like $25,000. Um, so that, that could be like a world that we see, uh, with, with agents and, um, USDC.\n\nGreat. Thank you. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSo where you using that AI, um, for reading the document and generating the, like, what the contract should be. So there is a human in the loop. Uh, so for in order to the, in order for the human to approve or reject it, he needs to go through that document himself as well, right? Uh, so how exactly is that agent saving any effort because the human has to still go and read the document, right? Yeah. Yeah. So like, you know, right now, like this is just a, a, a simple prototype, right? Um, we could have gone the extra mile and started out with someone, uh, you know, using NLP to like just create like a, a simple prompt to say, \"Hey, I want a contract between, you know, me and this other person that does these things.\" And then the agent goes out and writes it. And then the agent could actually, you know, um, parse out the information that it wrote and then send a notification to the two parties that this is agreement for $100 and these are the things that need to be met. Um, so that, that's that's a world where we, we could have done that, but like we were just trying to put together a simple prototype to just showcase the combination of technology, but this is not, you know, something we, we feel like is you should, you know, deploy in production and use right now, but it's in inspiration, you know, of combining these different technologies. Okay. Thanks. Yes. Yeah.\n\nSo I guess, um, yeah, uh, we don't have any other questions. We can close it out. Thanks, everyone.\n\n[Music]\n",
