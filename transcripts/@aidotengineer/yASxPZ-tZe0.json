um, conquering agent chaos.\nBut really, I'm talking about deployment, running, and deploying agents.\nUm, and just to give you an example, I was uh, I was at University of Florida.\nI'm from South Florida, and I was at University of Florida about a month and a half ago, and I was talking to a bunch of professors and their students on projects that they were deploying.\nAlmost all of them were working on some type of agents in their class projects, and uh, I asked all of them what was the number one problem.\nAnd they all said, including the professors, deploying agents, and uh, they similar problems that I I had before we we started Agentuity, which was like, you build this thing, you deployed on serverless.\nIn their case, they were using AWS and lambda, and then they, you know, timeouts, right?\nOh, my agent runs for 15 minutes, or my agent runs for 30 minutes.\nWe have an internal agent at Agentuity that runs for 40 minutes a day, something like that.\nSo they were running into that, and then uh, they weren't allowed to use VMs or EC2 for their projects.\nSo for obvious reasons, you want a bunch of students running EC2s, and um, a bunch of other things are running into the gateway issues, you know, wiring up agents, talking to agents, and things like that.\nSo it's a very, very common thing, and the other one is, you know, the whole web is built like for a stateless type concept, right?\nAgents are not stateless necessarily; they're stateful in a lot of cases, um, and so those are the deployment headaches that I was hearing over and over with the students, and that mapped to a problem I had about a year ago building a qualitative research agent set of agents.\nSame thing, I built it on serverless, not thinking, and then I realized, ah, crap, I got to rearchitect this whole thing because it's doing synthesis, and it takes a while, very common um, headaches.\nHas anybody experienced that headache before?\nI'm curious.\nYeah.\nDeploying agents.\nSo that led us to talk about like, well, what do agents need to be successful?\nSo they need to, they need to run as long as they need to run, um, and they need to be able to pause and stop and resume.\nThey also have decoupled from your code.\nThey need to have different inputs and outputs, and um, actually multiple various ones.\nRight.\nWe, I, I think we understand that, hopefully.\nAnd then I put this up here: introspection, self-observability, and self-reflection.\nThey need those two.\nUm, and we have that in the product.\nWe have like hotel tracing things.\nHopefully, you've all seen that, some of those types of things where you're doing introspection and and traces across.\nBut I put self-observability and self-reflection here because this is important.\nSo the the the observability things that we're used to are human-based, where we see like these traces and spans and um, the agents need to understand that as well.\nThere's a, there's a, there's a difference there.\nThere's a nuance difference there.\nOf course, it needs memory.\nIt needs to get better evolution code execution.\nSo that's what agents need to be successful.\nAnd so when I was again talking to those UF students, personal experience, um, we need those things, and that's what we started to build at Agentuity.\nSo, I just want to give you a demo.\nI'm trying to decide.\nShould I do a live demo or should I do the slides just in case?\nI don't know.\nLive.\nEverybody says live.\nYou all just want to watch the train wreck.\nAll right, we'll, we'll try it live.\nSo, I'll Wow.\nLive.\nWow.\nAll right, we'll do that.\nSo, um, I'm gonna Let's do this.\nLet's do this.\nLet's blow this baby up.\nCan you see this?\nOkay.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nGood.\nI was told I had to do it in light mode because that's what you do.\nSo, um, all right.\nSo, we have a CLI.\nSo, if you're going to start, you run agent create to create a project.\nUm, when you run it, drum roll.\nOkay.\nIn this case, I'm logged into a bunch of organizations.\nSo, I'm going to do our Agentuity uh demo one.\nWe have three runtimes that we support: Bun, Python with UV.\nYou notice we we put UV.\nWe're trying to bias people towards UV.\nPlease don't use pip.\nUm, and then no.js, of course.\nSo, those are our three runtimes.\nI'm going to pick bun.\nAnd then, uh, you can pick several templates, um, as a starting place.\nNow, we're we're a framework agnostic.\nYou notice there's MRA here.\nMonstra is pretty good if you're going down the TypeScript route.\nUm, I'm I'm going to pick Versel AI SDK and Grock.\nI, a lot of our stuff internally, we have 50 agents or so, and they're we don't use a framework.\nUm, but we're framework agnostic.\nSo you can bring crew AI and then deploy another one in lang chain, another one in paidantic, and then versel, and then they can all talk to each other.\nUm, internal networking talk to each other and that kind of thing.\nWe'll show you that here in a minute.\nTrying to leave enough time so we can have questions and answers.\nSo I'm going to pick Versel AIK with Grock.\nHonestly, it's my favorite combo with bun because of the speed.\nIt's amazing.\nUm, and then I'm going to name a project.\nLet's just call that project hello.\nA project is a grouping of agents.\nIt's also um, you can think of as like a one-to-one to a repo because you can hook it up to GitHub.\nAn agent, you get multiple agents in a project.\nYou get your default one here.\nSo let's just call this agent one.\nHello.\nUh, very creative name.\nNow, one of the things we give you, agents are a first-class citizen.\nAgain, back to deployment problems.\nAgents are a first-class citizen infra infrastructure citizen um in Agentuity.\nSo that means we handle all the routing and all that to that agent, and you can decide how you want to protect it.\nSo you can protect it via the whole project.\nEach agent in your project can have an API key.\nI'm going to do none right now because it's a demo.\nThere's more to that, but um, I'll skip over that right now.\nThen you can hook it up to GitHub.\nUh, so then if you merge main, it'll automatically deploy your project.\nAnd that's it.\nSo then we create this.\nI'll show you the code here in a second.\nI'm going to show you dev mode real quick, and then I'll we'll do the code.\nAll right.\nSo rocking on.\nSo let's do project hello.\nAnd before I show you the code, we have now this Versel AI SDK bun, you know, grock template, right?\nSo we have this command that you can run any of your agents with agent2 dev.\nIf you have multiple projects, you can run them, and then they'll they'll have ports assigned to them.\nAnd so now we're running this locally as you would expect.\nVery what you're used to, I'm sure.\nBut um, one of the things I want I want to show you is, so this is the this routing to the agent.\nWe only have one agent.\nSo that's the that's the agent ID.\nWell, we have this public routing.\nSo we do tunneling for you.\nSo if you wanted to hit it through another service or something while you're deving, you can do this uh publicly, too.\nAll right, but let me just show you the dev mode real quick.\nSo um, click this is Oh, of course I got logged out.\nWho expired the token?\nUm, okay.\nSo, um, we give you like this kind of simulator for your agent.\nSome agents don't take just text, right?\nSo, you can you can pick JSON, HTML, you can PDFs.\nUm, actually, we do emails and things like that, too.\nThat's not in this dev mode.\nBut this is where you can interact with your agent, test it out, and then when you do that, like I'm just going to run it a few times.\nWhat?\nI'm sorry.\nSomebody say something.\nOh, okay.\nUm, when you do that, you can get your logs.\nOf course, you can see in the terminal, too.\nUm, you can inspect the logs, get more information, and then the sessions are back to the remember the observability thing.\nSo, we have the human version of this here where you can look, and you can see like, oh, this hit the this hit our AI gateway, which we have an AI gateway, so you don't have to set up keys for any of these models or any of these services.\nAnd you can get the cost for that call, um, what the prompt was, what the response was, and all that.\nAnd this works in production, too.\nIt's the, it's a mirror image of production.\nSo, that's the dev mode.\nI don't want to spend too much time on it because we don't have much time, but that's So, put a pin in that.\nNow, I'm going to kill that.\nAnd you're like, \"Well, Rick, what does the code look like?\"\nAnd we're trying not to be too opinionated here, but we do have a few conventions.\nUm, let's do that.\nLet's do that.\nUm, so really the conventions we have in a project are you have a YAML file, surprise, and um, that's to help configure your agent when it's deployed.\nAnd then um, there's an agents folder.\nPython, it it works the same way.\nAnd um, you have an entry point.\nAnd so this is this is the simple simple template that we we created here.\nAnd the entry point in in this case in in JavaScript would be um, you export a default function, and that's your request handler.\nIf you guys have used Nex.js or you've used K natives or whatever, everybody should be familiar with that, hopefully.\nBut what we do is we handle all that routing that comes in to your agent, and we put it on that request object.\nAnd so that that could be an email.\nYou can add email to your agent.\nYou can add a phone number to your agent.\nYou can uh send a JSON, a PDF, whatever.\nWe have all those things that we route to it.\nYou can stream it.\nUm, and then also you have you have things that are like first kind of first-class citizens like ctx get agent, and then that, and then you can pass in an ID or a name.\nSo we have another agent.\nMaybe it's a pyantic agent over here, and we can actually get it.\nWe'll get an ephemeral token so it's allowed to talk to it for as long as it runs, and then you can execute it, send it back, you can stream it back.\nThere's a bunch of different things you can do here.\nUm, and so that's on this context object.\nSo there's I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this right now, but there's a there's a lot of like infrastructure we give you in this really simple handler.\nUm, uh, which is pretty cool.\nAll right, and that's it.\nThat's the only convention.\nSo again, like you can imagine if you're using Monstra, and we have a bunch of examples and templates that you can go look, you're you create Monstra template or models the way you you would normally do it, and you can drop them in right here.\nSame thing in Python.\nUm, there's a run function in Python, and that's what you have to declare, and then you can drop in a crew or a couple crews and then have it call paidantic 2 and another agent.\nUm, and that's it.\nThat's that's that's the code in a nutshell.\nNow let's deploy it really quick.\nYOLO.\nAll right.\nAnd it should, it the internet's fast.\nIt should upload pretty quick there.\nBoom.\nAll right.\nSo, we took, we took that agent, we wrapped it in a container, a specialized container.\nThat's in this case, it's a bun runtime.\nAnd now it's live.\nSo, if I if I click on that and jump to it, you can see um, this is when it was deployed.\nThere's our little happy bun.\nAnd um, let me show you something really quick that you haven't seen yet.\nSo in a project, again, you have multiple agents.\nI only have one agent that you saw me create, and then this is where you can get, you can get cost breakdown by project, by agent, by run.\nYou saw the session spans.\nSo we we try to surface that up in all different ways to help understand how much an agent is costing.\nBut this is where, remember when I said you can decouple inputs and outputs from your agent if you want to.\nAnd this is where I can hit plus here, and I can say, \"Hey, I want to give my agent an email.\"\nI hit save.\nAnd now I can email my agent.\nSo there's the email address right there.\nAnd I can do that with SMS.\nUm, I can do that with APIs.\nI can do a cron job, wakes up, does a bunch of things.\nUm, and that's inputs and outputs.\nSo it's a nice way to build an agent, and then if somebody wants to use it, they can hit deploy now from your GitHub repo, drop it in like, okay, let me wire this email up.\nLet me wire this up.\nLet me lie later.\nWe're going to get Slack and Discord and all that stuff, too.\nUm, so that's inputs and outputs.\nUm, actually, let me just go ahead and try to hit this right here.\nSo, this is our Remember, we didn't secure it, so it's public.\nSo, actually, if you took a picture and hit this, it probably would work.\nDon't do that.\nUm, let's just I don't know if this is going to work.\nHello.\nAll right.\nSo, I I hit the web hook.\nIt created this session.\nThere's the session ID.\nNow it's the age is off running, and I should start getting logs here.\nGot three minutes.\nThere it is.\nOh, it's an error because I probably Oh, I Okay, so this is in your YAML file.\nYou can change the uh, the memory, and I I need to change the memory footprint for this.\nSo, it didn't run.\nIt's like, nope.\nThat's something we're working on, too.\nSo, in a nutshell, that is that's what you get.\nOf course, you can wire up some integrations and and uh, actually I think I just lost internet.\nOkay, there we go.\nThere we go.\nYou can wire up some integrations, GitHub, and a bunch of other stuff that's coming.\nSo um, to to kind of wrap up, this is this was like the thing that we wanted to build not just for everybody, but for us because we wanted to, we have now 50, 60 agents internally built on this, and it's like, finally, we're getting really good velocity, and I'm really excited about, so this is our first product in our agent native cloud suite that we plan\n\n\nOn working on, um, this summer, we're working\non, um, infrastructure agents that watch\nour logs and uh, surface things that are\ncoming up for, for, um, for developers and\nus. And uh, we kind of, we were joking last\nnight, we should call it Agentuity, not\npager duty, like the agent's going to do\nthat. So,\nright, exactly. So yeah, so there's a bunch\nof stuff coming, but that's where we're\nat right now. Stop by the booth. Um, we got\none minute and 50 seconds, so if there's\nany questions, we got about a minute and\n50 seconds, any, any questions?\nJokes, anecdotes?\nTry to leave just enough. Yes.\nOne thing\nthat I've been hearing about recently is\nthe idea of adding tools into,\num,\ntokens. Is that something you think\nabout?\nYeah. Uh-huh. And it, I mean, yeah, for\nsure. Yeah. Um,\nthat now there's a, for us, like, from a\nproduct perspective, there's a thing we\nalways ask ourselves, which is, what does\nan agent need to be successful? And, and\nsome of that is what, like, we want to\noffer that as a services layer from an\ninfrastructure services perspective,\nwhere a lot of that stuff you just get\nout of the box, and then you can hook it\nup to a versel AI SDK tool thing, or you\ncan hook it up to something else, like, we\nwant to do some of those kind of service\nlevel things.\nBut I mean, like, on a\ntactical level, yeah, I, I think it's, I\nmean, I need them actually for a CRM\nagent that we're working on. So, yeah.\nCool.\nAll right. Thanks, everybody, for\ncoming.\n[Music]\n",
