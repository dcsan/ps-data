  "cleanText": "[Music]\n\nOkay.\nUh, my name is Vikas Paruchuri.\nI'm the CEO of Datalab.\nAnd today I'm going to talk about how we got to 40K GitHub stars, seven figure ARR, and train state-of-the-art models with a team of three.\n\nSo I spent the last year training these models like Britney mentioned marker and surya.\nI also built repositories around them.\nI left my AI research job and I started a company and raised a seed round.\nUh, I did not get enough sleep.\nIt's important.\n\nAnd this is Datalab.\nSo we made our first hire in January.\nWe're now a team of four.\nFaraz is new enough that he's not pictured.\nUm, we've grown in revenue 5x since January.\nWe're at 7ig and our customers include tier one AI labs, universities, Fortune 500, and AI startups, including Gamma, who I used to make this presentation.\nUm, so today's focus, I'm going to talk about how we've grown with a small team.\nI'm going to talk about my philosophy on building teams and why I think we're at kind of an inflection point in how we think about building teams.\nAnd I'm really going to talk about this idea that headcount does not equal productivity.\nThere's like this really persistent notion in Silicon Valley that you raise money, you hire a bunch of people, and you build more, but it almost never, in my opinion, works out perfectly that way.\n\nAll right, so my last company was called Data Quest.\nI'm very fond of the data prefix, apparently.\nUh, and we scaled to 30 people and 4 million ARR bootstrap during CO.\nIt was an online education startup.\nUm, and then unfortunately, we had to do two rounds of layoffs postco when online education kind of tanked.\nWe went from 30 to 15 and then again from 15 to 7.\nAnd it was obviously awful for the people we had to lay off.\nBut I noticed something really interesting.\nProductivity and happiness increased a couple of months after both layoffs to the point where we were actually much more productive after both cycles than we were at the beginning.\nAnd I started to wonder why that was, like, how could reducing the team so much actually improve productivity?\nAnd I came up with these four hypotheses.\nOne, we'd hired a lot of specialists.\nSo as you scale, like Grant mentioned in the earlier talk, you end up building these very specialized functions and teams, and those specialists often can't flex across the company to solve the key issues of the company.\nTwo, we were a remote team, which required a lot of intentional process and heavy syncing, which just eats into your time and just makes it really hard to get on the same page.\nUm, because of that, we had a lot of meeting overload, and especially once we got middle management in place, people whose job is kind of professionally to manage, we ended up with just a lot of meetings on people's calendars and not enough time to actually work.\nAnd then senior people, we hired kind of a mix of experience, like most companies do.\nWe hired junior, mid-level, senior, and then senior people ended up getting kind of tied down in doing a lot of work uh to manage the more junior people.\nI, we actually had a case where we had a three-person team and we cut it down to one, and the team actually got much more productive because it freed up the senior person's time.\nUm, and kind of every company, I feel like goes through this journey.\nThere's this initial golden period when everyone is aligned.\nYou're on the same page.\nYou're building this amazing stuff, and that's really when you build the core thing of your company, um, like Google uh with search or Microsoft with Windows.\nIt's kind of when you figure out your business model and then you hire a bunch to fill out the edges around it.\nLike you hire a bunch of enterprise sales, you hire a bunch of marketing, you hire a bunch of engineers who are kind of in very small boxes to build very small features.\nI had a friend at Amazon who worked there for two years and built a shopping cart button.\nUm, it's it's fine, right?\nBut I mean, at at that scale of org, that's kind of the tiny box you get fit in.\nUh, and you end up with a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of syncs, a lot of unclear priorities.\nUm, and this pattern is unfortunately very common.\nBut I started to think, what if that golden period just lasted forever?\nWhy, why do you actually need to end it?\nAnd as I started working with Jeremy Howard at Answer AI, I got to understand his philosophy for building a company a little bit better.\nAnd his idea is basically hire less than 15 generalists.\nSo people who can really do everything across the stack and really understand all aspects of the company, fill in the edges with AI and internal tooling.\nSo Jeremy's invested a lot recently in fast HTML and things like Monster UI because he sees them as kind of building block libraries to really build out the other tools that the company's working on.\nUh, and then use simple boring tech, right?\nLike you don't need to get too fancy.\nYou don't need a Kubernetes cluster when you're a three-person company.\nUm, but this unfortunately requires uh kind of a high cultural bar for folks.\nUm, you need people who really want to and can understand everything you're doing.\nSo you need engineers who talk to customers.\nYou need go-to-market people who actually build.\nUh, and that's that's not necessarily easy to find.\nYou need high trust.\nSo, um, basically, you need people who are in it because they're building something together uh and not in it for other reasons like politics or personal advancement, etc.\nAnd everyone needs to really care about the customers and focus on them.\nUm, I think these are the prerequisites for this kind of team working, this less than 15 person team of generalists.\n\nI, I'll give you a quick example.\nSo we recently trained a model, Syria OCR 3.\nUh, it, we recently shipped it but have not announced it yet.\nSo it's 500 million parameters that supports 90 languages and 99% accuracy on our challenging internal benchmarks that include math.\nUm, and it also does some features that no other model does, like character level bounding boxes.\nIt uses PDF text as grounding at a line level.\nUm, so it was a very challenging model to train, and in order to do it, Darun, who's a research engineer at Datalab, and I had to handle the entire process from end to end.\nSo that included talking to customers, figuring out what they wanted.\nUh, it included reading a bunch of papers and figuring out the right architecture, prototyping, doing the model training itself, which you always hope is 90% architecture, but is always 90% data cleaning.\nSo, building a data pipeline library, building out the data sets, then we had to write the inference code.\nSo, we had to connect it to our repos, get the inference written for all our customers, and then integrate it into our products.\nSo, this is a scope that in a big company, you'd probably have four, 10, you'd have a lot of teams doing this.\nAnd every time you hand off between teams in a traditional company, you lose context, right?\nThe people who talk to the customers lossily communicate it to the people who build, who lossily communicate it to the people who train the model.\nUm, it just gets, it becomes very inefficient.\nYou end up eating a lot of time in just syncing context.\nIt never gets fully synced.\nYou're not able to build a great end-to-end experience as a result.\nAnd you have very slow feedback loops, right?\nLike you talk to a customer today and it might impact your model training in months.\nUm, whereas if you have generalists who can work across the stack, you get seamless context, right?\nYou never need to share context and do inefficient syncing.\nYou get a really tight integration between all aspects of the company and very, very fast feedback cycles.\nUm, and the reason we were able to do this is we used AI to to take kind of the easy low-leverage pieces of this, um, like building a data pipeline library or helping us really figure out how to integrate it into the API, whereas we did the higher level work in each of these silos.\n\nSo I, if you get one thing from this talk, this is the thing: more people does not equal more productivity.\nUm, all right, and like how do you make this work, like how do you operationalize this?\nSo the first thing you have to do is hire senior generalists.\nAnd senior to me does not mean years of experience.\nIt really means maturity.\nYou need people who can look at a problem and say, \"I'm going to figure out how to solve this.\nI'm going to do what it takes and I really care enough to iterate with the customer to solve it.\"\nUm, you need to avoid over complication, right?\nLike I'm an engineer, a lot of us are engineers, we love over complicating things, like, \"Hey, let me deploy this Kubernetes cluster and multi-stage pipeline to solve like a data extraction problem.\"\nUm, but in reality, you need people who can go back and like kind of set aside the fixation on shiny tech and just do the simplest possible thing, which usually is, \"I'm just going to write a shell script to run this on one machine.\"\nThere's that famous like Hadoop versus shell script blog post uh from a few years ago when you like you could replace a whole Hadoop cluster with just like a 64 core machine.\nUh, you need people who who appreciate that ethos.\nUm, and you need to work in person.\nI personally think, um, remote is great for a lot of reasons, but it's not great for a small team that needs to move fast.\nUm, because you need to set up a lot of process, and process to me is kind of the death of this really fast collaboration and tight feedback loop.\n\nAnd then how do you do it architecturally?\nSo, um, I, I alluded to this a little bit, but you have to reuse components aggressively.\nSo we reuse a lot of components between our on-prem and our API deployments.\nWe keep our technology super simple, like we don't use React.\nWe don't use any fancy front-end frameworks.\nIt's all server rendered HTML with like light HTMX and Alpine and then super clean modular code that AI can really add to very well.\nLike we rearchitected our marker repo to be extremely modular and easy to to work with and well documented, and that makes it much easier to use AI to actually add to it.\n\nAll right.\nSo basically, keep everything simple.\nCode is clean, readable, maintainable.\nArchitecture as few moving pieces as possible.\nUm, minimize your surface area and then process.\nMinimize bureaucracy, high trust, continuous discussions.\nUm, if, if you feel like someone's going to need a lot of management, like don't hire them.\nLike you need people who can, who can move fast without being managed.\nUm, all right.\nAnd then how do you fill in the edges with models?\nSo, a challenge we're going to face as we scale is this idea that we're, we're a document processing, document intelligence company.\nAnd every customer has a slightly different way that they want to parse their docs.\nAnd if you go back kind of to the last generation of OCR companies, the way they solve this is they hired a bunch of Ford deployed engineers, you sat at a client site and you just kind of iterated with them until it was good enough.\nBut in the future, you can really train a model to handle this complexity, right?\nLike we can train a model to essentially loop over customer outputs until it gets to the the right state.\nSo you can kind of replace that entire forward deployed engineering side of the org.\nUm, and then when does this model fail?\nLike we're early, right?\nI don't know exactly when this model falls apart.\nUm, but Gamma, as as we just saw, is a great example of a small team with with very, very meaningful growth in ARR.\nI think the key is being able to say no, right?\nA lot of these edges are choices, right?\nYou can choose to go hire a bunch of Ford deployed engineers and put them at your client sites or you can choose to solve it a different way.\nAnd maybe that different way is slightly less efficient in terms of revenue.\nUm, but it might be more efficient in terms of your long-term company trajectory and health.\nUm, so it's really unknown if this will work forever.\nBut in my opinion, like it's your choice, right?\nLike you can choose to make this model work or you can choose to to do the less efficient, let's scale to hundreds of people model.\nUm, all right.\nSo LLMs are surprisingly bad at generating ven diagrams.\nSo that explains why this slide is is is not so well done.\nUm, but basically we have three core roles and the the responsibilities overlap a lot.\nSo everybody talks to customers.\nUm, everybody builds product in some way, and research engineer and full stack engineer overlap quite a bit.\nUm, and then go to market is really like your traditional kind of sales, marketing, support functions all collapsed into kind of like a more generalist role.\nUm, and really like I feel like politics are the death of small teams, right?\nLike we want people who only care about the work, the people around them and customers, right?\nLike minimal ego.\nYou need some ego to to kind of advance your own ideas, but not so much that you're willing to fight for them at the detriment of of kind of the health of the company.\nUm, we pay top of market salary, right?\nLike it's always weird to me that startups pay 150 or 200k when they've raised 20 million, right?\nLike you should be able to hire fewer people with higher salaries and get more done, in my at least that that's what I've seen.\nUm, meaningful work, so big challenges in scope, right?\nLike if you come in, you get to work across the stack, you get to ship things end to end, uh, and that's very exciting for some people, it's it's not exciting to other people and they kind of self-select.\nAnd then you really need a good way to screen for low ego and GSD, right?\nLike you need people who will ship, not talk about shipping.\nUm, and that's another downside of remote culture in my opinion, it's very, it gets very hard to tell the two apart.\nUm, and then patience, right?\nLike the worst hires I've personally made have all been when I thought I had to fill a role very quickly.\nAll of my best hires have been when I said, \"Okay, let me find the best person and and hire them.\"\nEven though I may not necessarily have a role today, they're a great generalist.\nUm, this is actually a big debate in NBA and NFL drafting, too.\nLike best player available versus drafting for fit.\nUm, all right.\nSo really I think the thing to think about as you scale is like how do we scale productivity, not headcount, and you can do that in a few ways, right?\nLike you can raise salary bands as the company grows, so you hire more and more experienced people into the same role.\nUm, you can invest more in compute, right?\nLike a one researcher with access to eight GPUs is less productive than one with access to 64 GPUs.\nYou can invest in AI tools that multiply productivity, right?\nThere's so many tools out there now, um, that are worth paying for that can abstract away a lot of these edges for.\nAnd finally, uh, I'd be remiss if I didn't\n\n\nDon't say if this culture sounds interesting to you, drop me a line.\nThose are all my socials.\nUm, we'd love to chat.\nAll right.\nYes.\nUh, I think we do the microphone for questions, right?\nSo, um, when you went from 30 to 15 to seven, I mean, my takeaway from this whole talk is like the human touch points are really what slowed things down, right?\nUm, was there any uh additional focus on reducing the domains that you were focusing on or like your capability sets, or it was like basically your same product offering just with less folks focused on it?\nYeah, that's a really good question.\nSo at a very high level, we offered the same product, but we cut some features that were less relevant.\nLike we'd built up a lot of those edges that you kind of like end up building over the years.\nUh, and we ended up slicing a lot of those edges.\nSo I think I think what happens when you hire a lot of people is you don't have enough work and you start making work for people, right?\nAnd they end up building all of these edges that actually aren't that useful to the customer.\nBut when you have a tiny team, there's so much work that you actually have to ruthlessly prioritize.\nAnd I think you always want to be in that zone.\nAnd that's kind of where we ended up back.\nOh, sorry.\nNo worries.\nSo uh, it's a hypothetical question for you.\nSo, we take you and drop you in the middle of a giant company that's been around for a hundred years, hundreds of thousands of employees, lots of bureaucracy, lots of ego, got super comfortable with a revenue stream.\nUm, and they're clearly folding over on themselves with too many people.\nHow do you change that culture?\nYeah, I'm not the right person for that.\nI've never done that before.\nUm, I I would say you the people who want to change the culture go start a small company and build the same thing, just build it better.\nThat that's a common pattern, right?\nLike that's a common disruption growth cycle.\nUm, I think that's the best way to do it.\nLike it's it's just once a culture gets oified, like I've worked at the State Department, Pepsi, UPS, like once a culture gets oified enough, like you're not going to change it.\nLike it's just it just is what it is.\nGenerally with that pattern, what happens is these companies recognize that they're a target and they start to buy up those small startups and crush them.\nYeah, sometimes that happens, but like I mean Google is a great example of where that didn't happen, right?\nSo, you haven't talked about how you source these these uh really good generalists, I think.\nYeah, that's that's a great question.\nWell, one way is is this.\nOkay.\nUh, another way is uh is just open source and Twitter are great ways uh to hire.\nLike uh a lot of a lot of best candidates have actually come from Twitter, which is weird.\nI refuse to call it X.\nIt's still Twitter.\nUm, but yeah, uh, I I don't I don't have a great answer to that, but I think if you do good work and you put it out in public and you talk about how you're building, like that seems to attract people who really care about this mission and want to build in the same way.\nAt least that's been my experience.\nThank you.\nYeah.\nUh, well, actually, it's related.\nUh, so how do you structure your interview process in recruitment?\nLike how does it look like you maybe do a trial period or Yeah, that's a great question.\nSo, uh, three steps.\nSo, step one is people come in, we do a short chat.\nIt's really like talking to a peer.\nLike, uh, here's a challenge I'm having.\nLet me talk it through with you and see if we can solve it together.\nIf that goes well, step two is let's think of a project we can build together.\nSo, we do a paid project.\nIt's usually around 10 hours.\nWe pay $1,000.\nIt's like, it sounds like a lot, but it's actually a tiny amount of money to to figure out if someone's a fit or not.\nUm, and then we review the project, and if it's good, we come in and just do a culture fit.\nLike how does it feel if we're all just interacting as humans and people and and does if it feels like a good fit like it's a hire?\nYeah.\nAnd what is your like success rate there?\nLike maybe 10% of the people that goes through the pro through that process uh get Oh, that's that's an interesting question.\nLike usually we don't once we kind of get someone to the beginning of the process, we have high confidence that we could like we don't want to waste anyone's time.\nUm, but we probably of the people we've interviewed, I think 40% have we've ended up hiring.\nYeah.\nNice.\nThank you.\nAll right.\nI'm out of time.\nThank you folks.\nThis is great.\n[Music]\n",
