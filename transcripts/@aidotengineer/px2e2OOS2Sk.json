  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHi, I'm Lizzie. I'm a developer advocate at Cloudflare. And I'm Nick. I'm a developer experience engineer at WorkOS.\nYes. So, at Cloudflare, I make a lot of AI demos, AI MCP servers. Anyone here also making any of those?\nYes.\nAgents.\nNice. Of course, should have guessed because conference. So, I've been having fun making agents and MCP servers that act on behalf of me. I built an agent to auto vote in the NBA finals for me and then I got blocked eventually. Uh, anyways, like book tennis courts in San Francisco, cuz Lord knows that is hard enough to do already. So, I think that's like a great agent use case. Agent that acts for me automate some of the tedious parts of my life, things that I want to do. However, that does beg the question, how do you control what they're allowed to do?\nYeah. And we're we're moving so fast with all of this and having fun getting it to do things. You know, GitHub MCP is like one of my favorites because I can just like get it going and and uh have it like read reviews for me, read diffs for me, and and uh just help me manage GitHub, uh which is really awesome but it's very like developer centric obviously it's GitHub but MCPs in general like you have to go and edit this like JSON file and do that and it's really tough to to like I have to give it a pat and you know that's that's an advanced use case for non-developers uh and so we really need a way to let these tools act on our behalf uh but in a more traditional way that's easy for for end users to be able to set that up and um so yeah that that's what we do at WorkOS. Uh we we do like authorization and user management. And like the the main point of this talk is to really help uh drive the idea that we need like the same kind of credentials and uh authorization that we do with user-facing projects. We need the agents to do that as well as a start and then we have a lot of places that we can go with this as we get more fine-grained. Um but really the the point is that OAuth really just isn't for humans anymore. It's for our agents acting on our behalf.\nAnd you know what else agents need? Memory, persistent storage.\nAnyone here use Cloudflare?\nYou think you know what Cloudflare does?\nNo.\nI'm here to tell you that you do not.\nPeople are like, \"Oh, you do security, CDN, DOS protection, bot management.\" We do so much more. We have compute cloud workers. We can host your code on the edge. Uh we host AI models. You can run inference on uh vectorized. We have a vector database, a SQL database, durable objects which is what we use in our agents framework to maintain memory.\nVery important.\nAnd video streaming, image optimization, so much more. If you use Cloudflare workers, we have bindings. Bindings let you interact from your web app, from your website, from your agent as well because our agents and MCB servers are kind of similar in that you can use bindings to interact with other Cloudflare products. And also just like of course you can use other companies products as well. And of course now we have a free tier. Durable optics used to not be free. Now you can use it. And I know startups who use Cloudflare who do not pay us and they make money. I digress.\nBut yeah, all of these pieces, they really help to um like they just fit naturally into building these agents because they'll deliver the code to where you're at. Uh and you can use the durable objects to store persistence on them. Uh and you can also use things uh like like authorization to um make sure and there's a whole OAuth framework with uh Cloudflare's uh agents framework that lets you set up that authorization so that you can easily uh know who the worker is or the agent is acting on behalf of.\nYeah.\nSo and this agenda will be made available at the end in the GitHub repo. It's a markdown file.\nSo we we did build uh an MCP server uh using Cloudflare and using WorkOS and uh it's just a very basic one. You'll be able to check it out and you can use it and run it today. Uh which is really awesome. Um and we we're just going to deploy it real quick. So I'll just do um npm run uh deploy which will run Wrangler to deploy that. And soon as it's out there uh we'll be able to see it in my uh in my compute here. Oops, I was just there.\nThat's the Cloudflare dashboard and it's also very easily to run locally as well with like npm run or wringler run something similar.\nSo a few seconds ago uh we've got it deployed and going back to the terminal it gave me a URL here and so I can just copy my workers URL and I'm going to go over to my client Claude and I'm just going to hit this button and say add integration and it's going to pop up. I'll make this big. Uh, and I can go add integration. And I'll just say I want to add MCP.shop.\nWhat could it be? Naming themes is hard.\nJust tacking on it. Slmmcp onto there.\nAnd now I've got MCP shop. And I'm going to connect. And so once I connect, uh, this is pulling up and allowing me to tell the agent, uh, who to act on behalf of, me in this case. Uh, so I'm going to sign in with GitHub. It's going to do its thing and then cloud or uh sorry cloud is refreshed and now it can act on behalf of me and can we see the tools?\nYeah.\nSo what should we ask?\nLet's order a shirt.\nLet's order a shirt. I love shirts.\nYo, I hear I can get a shirt. get a shirt from you.\nLive demos in an LLM.\nWi-Fi don't fail us.\nSo, it's running and it recognized that it has tools available now from MCP shop. So, it's going to list the inventory. We'll go ahead and let it run.\nYeah, there's an MCP shirt. You can get it for free. Uh, and you can pick your size. And then all it needs is just your company name and your mailing address.\nAnd so I'll say give me uh I'll say XL and one two three Main Street uh Belleview, Nebraska. There's a building, Nebraska. Uh and we'll do that.\nOh, it needs my company name.\nThat's so linked in.\nDuh.\nMight be my company name is WorkOS duh now.\nSo, let that run.\nI was sure thinking about it. It's confirmed it.\nDone. And there's my order number. It's going to be sent to that address. And I'm going to say what uh is the order info so I can see what uh is my name or my company name works. Duh.\nKind of hope it is.\nHuman in the loop.\nNeed to confirm.\nNo, I got it. A right.\nThat was totally me, not Claude.\nUh, so yeah, I was able to order a shirt and you can as well. But that's just a piece of it. So when we ran this, um, it's going into close that. Uh, if we go into my Cloudflare platform here and go to storage KV, I've got an orders here. This is key value storage.\nYep. And there is the data from the order. So now I've got that saved off. I can use that Uh, and it was all through that interface. So, we really just like gave Claude the tools that it needed and it was able to act on my behalf. And I can go back in and I can say like, \"Can you tell me what you know about me?\"\nAnd this so we've got a get user info. And this is really just going to give me like mostly the the JWT information. What's on my my JWT uh that Claude now knows about me. So it knows my name. It knows my email address. In my JWT I have my favorite song in there. Um Careless Whisper. Uh now I will give you a rendition. Uh and so um from there it also knows that I have admin permissions. Uh so I've shot admin access because that's in my roles and permissions.\nThe the other cool thing that you can do uh with like the Cloudflare piece of it and because like your your MCP server is a um durable object, you can also store data like directly on that that's that's located on that. You want to explain that\ndurable objects tough name. If you search Twitter, people tweet about how they're like, \"This is a bad name. Change the name.\" But very fast storage. You can spin them up per user. Uh they're close to the user as well for like faster retrieval and storage.\nAnd so what I did is I just asked it to change the demo mode to band. And that ran a tool uh in the MCP server itself that is uh just going in and on the uh context that's associated with this worker object, it's just changing the mode to band. And so now I've got that and now I can say um I want another shirt, please.\nAnd it's going to try and run it.\nI'll just always allow that now.\nAnd it was able to check that and it said absolutely not. Go away wave.\nUm and so like we can mix what it knows about me with what it has stored about me on the durable object and that's in unique for every user of it. And then uh I can do things like uh change it again. So if I say pretty please it might have a pretty please tool available. Sure is thinking. Yay. Since I asked nicely, it's going to let me. And I just ordered another shirt.\nPrompt engineering.\nIf you want to build your own MCP servers on Cloudflare, you can click to deploy your own with no authorization.\nSo it's offless. So probably don't do that, but it is very quick to do so. You click click to deploy. It generates a GitHub repo for you. You get clone that and then you edit your own tools and they give you some tools to begin with. So it's like very fast but again that is oless do o and it's still quick to deploy as well with o just like slightly less fast.\nYeah and the the beauty of this is that we're bringing the like you know pretty simple tools like this is just a flow being added to an MCP and MCP is effectively just an API. Uh so we're just like you know getting it caught up with the tools that we already have uh for humans but it's important to get this uh ready to go for these tools to act on our behalf as well. And where we can see this going in the future is like much more fine grained authorization where it's maybe like authorizing you know per line changes or or per tool changes or even like maybe like authorizing like the networks uh the connections between things and just doing as we see it growing to doing thousands of of tasks on our behalf.\nThis off piece is going to be very important. uh and especially the audit trail as well. And we can get that with with O tools too just to make sure that like we can see why this interacted this way on whose behalf was it on and what was the end result where did it fail uh where did it go wrong things like that.\nThink of your users not as users but as deputies they have access to tools and they can use and also misuse them as well. Sometimes I think I trust people like I do a live demo and I'm like let's see user um input. People sometimes do not nice inputs.\nYeah. So get out there and deputize your own tools. Um we'll we have this repo available. There is the code uh a QR code for this repo. Also the top QR code is get your own shirt.\nA shirt. Yeah. Uh so or you can just go to mcp.shop shop, uh, which you will run the same workflow that I just ran. Uh, it doesn't have the pretty police tool in it, though. Uh, unfortunately, it'll just it'll just do it even if you're mean to it. Uh, but you can order a shirt for the low low price of $0. So, go check it out. Get an MCP t-shirt.\nAnd if you want to add your own pretty please tool, check out the code in the second curo code. And we can't wait to see what MCP servers you build with OAuth. Thank you.\nThank you.\n[Music]\n",
