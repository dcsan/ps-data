your applications and business.\nMy name is Du'An Lightfoot, and I'm joined by Swap.\nSwap.\nYeah, there we go.\nThere you go.\nMy name is Dwan Lifford, and I'm joined by Hey, I'm Banjo Bami.\nI'm a Sr. Developer Advocate here at AWS.\n\nNow, this is the AI Engineer World's Fair, and I've been in tech over 15 years, and right now is the most exciting time for me in my entire career.\nAnd one of the reasons for this excitement is agents.\nHow many of you right now are building agentic systems?\nI love it.\nSo when we talk about agentic AI, I think it's important that we level set from an AWS perspective.\nThere are three key terms we need to think about.\nFirst, the ability to plan.\nAn agent gets a prompt.\nIt gets an objective, and it determines the actions that need to be taken.\nSo it creates the plan, and then it takes actions on those actions by using things like tools.\nNow the last piece, the third piece, and probably the most interesting is the reasoning where the agent is able to evaluate the results and determine if it needs to update the plan and take additional actions until the objective is complete.\nThis is an agent.\n\nNow when we actually break down the architecture, I think it's important to take a look at this because we have the user input, we have the agentic system, we have the possibility of some type of human in the loop, and then we have the generator response.\nNow when we dive a little deeper, there's some components of this agentic system.\nWe have the LLM.\nWe have a knowledge base with external information that we want may want to provide.\nWe have guardrails to say to the model don't do this or to ground the model with the truth from our knowledge base to say okay is this actual relevant information.\nIs this accurate to the information we're receiving from the knowledge base?\nAnd then we have access to additional tools, memory, or we may need to talk to additional agents or LLMs like Amazon Nova Act through something like MCP.\nAnd we have the ability to design our own flows for these systems.\n\nNow, the most interesting piece that I think a lot of us are probably focused on when we're building these systems is around the continuous evaluation framework.\nLike how do we know if we're using the right LLM?\nHow do we know if our prompt is consistent, accurate, or even optimized for the performance we're expecting?\nAnd then how do we even judge our system?\nHow do we rate that and determine that that it's actually solving the problems that we need or intend?\nNow, once we have this, we need to log this information and then have some type of subject matter expert and determine how can we improve this system.\nAnd this is the iterative approach.\nSo we're always trying to improve and optimize our agentic system.\n\nNow continuing on with this story.\nNow there are some use cases that we should be building these systems for.\nLike if it's complex task and we don't know which tools should be used, how many tools should be used, and we want the model to leverage his reason and capabilities.\nWell, this is a great use case for a gentic system.\nBut if it's something that is just one step, our traditional if this then that approach is probably the best solution, right?\nWe don't always need to provide some type of agentic system for something that can be done with a traditional solution.\n\nNow when we talk about agents on AWS, there are three approaches and perspectives we should think about.\nFirst is going to be to specialize using something like Amazon Q.\nHow many of you have used Amazon Q?\nThe there's Amazon Q in the console to help solve your problems on AWS.\nIn the console, there's Amazon Q developer inside of your IDE.\nAnd right now, one that I'm I think most excited about is Amazon QLI agent.\nHow many of you have used that?\nFor me, if you if you are into increasing your productivity, using a CI a CLI agent has helped me tremendously.\nYou from editing a video, it can do that.\nSummarizing a document, reading my entire codebase.\nLike today for one of my demos, I had some code and I was trying to figure out why wasn't it working.\nI said, &quot;Analyze this code and tell me what you see.\nLet me know the APIs that it's calling.&quot;\nWell, I looked up the APIs.\nWell, it didn't match my APIs in the API gateway.\nSo, when the code was deployed, it wasn't deployed with the right APIs.\nSo, the agent was able to help me save a ton of time by just analyzing the code and tell me what it saw because I never seen the code before, right?\nSo, that's what these tools are able to um to help us do.\nThe next is fully managed.\nIf you're using Amazon Bedrock, you're able to leverage Amazon Bedrock agents to build and manage agents inside of AWS.\nAnd today what we're going to be focusing on is the DIY the do-it-yourself approach by using strands agents.\nThis is allows you to not just leverage Amazon bedrock but also leverage models through other providers using light lm.\n\nNow when we talk about strands agents strands agent was announced about a month ago.\nI want to say something about a month ago.\nThis is open source extremely lightweight.\nSo if you use other agent FL frameworks, it's like that.\nBut the implementation is you'll see in the code how easy it is to build a aentic system or a agent itself in a few lines of code and already get started.\nI built a multi- aent solution in about under 50 lines of code.\nAnd so when we break down strands agents, there are three components.\nWe have a prompt, we have a LLM, and we have tools.\nSo you create a function called let's say a get weather tool right you define your agent you give it a prompt and it's already implemented and you'll see in the code as Banjo goes through it here in a moment.\n\nNow taking it a step further as Danielle presented today on Amazon Nova Act these models are able to do some really cool things and this is another thing that I'm excited about Amazon Nova Act is a research preview model.\nAnd the capabilities of this allows you to use a prompt or give instructions and take complex tasks and do things like browse the internet to find research or to research or to search on Amazon.com to find the top list of widgets, right?\nAnd then return them and then add them to your cart.\nSo you'll see how we can leverage this not just using the SDK for Amazon Nova ACT but also by leveraging MCP which leads us into the last piece which I think when we talking about agents I don't think we would be here today as fast as we have moved if it wasn't for MCP.\nHow many of you are leveraging MCP today?\nModern contest protocol.\nHow many of you have built your own MCP servers?\nI built several um I got two that I use all the time.\nOne, how many of you use Obsidian?\nOkay, so for my documentation, I built the Obsidian MCP server.\nThis allows me to save all my documents, reference all my documents, and just my entire workflow is streamlined because of this MCP server I use right there.\nBut I also use one for my bookmarks.\nI built the bookmark manager because every Friday I'm restarting my computer and I lose my bookmarks.\nI save them and I forget about them.\nBut now I can just say save this bookmark.\nIt gives it a description, gives it a title, give it a date and I can even add notes so I can remember where this bookmark.\nSo now when I open up QCLI, I can say hey I'm looking on the top.\nI'm looking for um some information on MCP.\nCan you tell me all the bookmarks that I have?\nThen it'll find it.\nCan you tell me the ones I saved last week?\nAnd so these this is the power that we have today.\nBut with that being said, I think it's time that we all start building.\nBanjo's going to take over.\nBut if you you open your laptops and log on to this link, this is going to take you to a workshop environment where you have access to an Amazon account where Banjo is going to walk you through building out today's workshop.\nI thank you for your time.\n\nCool.\nAll right.\nSo, uh, this is going to be a hands-on workshop.\nSo, we've provisioned an AWS account for everybody here.\nSo you don't have to install anything on your computer.\nEverything is going to be done through the browser.\nAnd I always say the hardest part of the workshop is just getting started.\nSo some of my colleagues are also here.\nSo raise your hand AWS folks that are here to support.\nUh so we're going to take some time to just get logged into an environment.\nWe're going to set up a VS Code server, enable models, uh get the Nova Act API key.\nSo again, this is the hardest part of the workshop, just getting started.\nUh so let's take some time to just get into the environment and I'll follow along as well.\nSo, and this is uh again everything is you don't have to install anything on your computer.\nYou don't have to use your own AWS account.\nEverything is provisioned for you.\nSo, but while that's loading, let me briefly walk through the three modules of the workshop.\nUh so, the workshop is really about how you can use Nova Act.\nSo, the first module is just getting started with Nova Act.\nWe're going to make an API call that the second part of the module is going to make an MCP server that can leverage a Nova Act.\nAnd then finally, we're going to use the strands agent to hook everything together.\nSo that's kind of the the three steps you'll go through at this workshop and all the code is available via the link on GitHub so you can try it out on your own as well.\nUh but yeah trying to get started here if you can't follow along I'm going to be doing up here so don't worry too much and again all the code is available so you can try it outline uh offline.\n\nOkay, so the first things first, uh, if you're following along, make sure to click this open AWS console button.\nAgain, we provision the AWS account.\nYou know, don't log into your own AWS account.\nDon't try to create a new one.\nEverything is uh previsioned here already.\nSo, going to click clicking that button to open up your AWS account.\nSo, logged into my AWS account.\nSo the first thing we do in an AWS account, we're going to enable uh Amazon Bedrock models.\nSo Amazon Bedrock think of as a serverless API to access different foundation models and you can build lots of gen applications in it.\nSo it has capabilities like knowledge bases, guard rails, you can build agents on top of it for anything you need to build uh AI agents or geniary applications.\nAmazon Bedrock has capabilities for that.\nBut for this workshop, we're just going to enable specific models.\nSo going to enable specific models.\nYou can click the Amazon models and we used the Claude 37, 3.5 IQ, and 3.5 sonnet.\nSo those are the ones we're going to use for this workshop.\nAnd that's going to request access there.\nAnd again, all the instructions are also in this workshop as well.\nUh, so we could follow along, but I'm just going to go through it just for sake of time.\nAnd then the next part once we get the model access, there's a VS Code server that has everything set up already.\nSo I'm just going to go in there and if the URL and password is there, you can log in to your VS Code server with everything installed.\nand I'm also going to log into Amazon Q.\nSo, Amazon Q is our U ID extends in to help you write code.\nU we have time you can sign up through a builder ID completely free.\nYou don't need uh AWS account.\nYou don't need to put in your credit card.\nYou can just uh log in through there.\nI already have an account so just feed it up but it puts uh nice little AI agent there.\nI can ask questions, update code, etc.\nSo it's uh I'll show you some examples of go through some of the code.\nSo So who's gotten to this point setting up all the models workshops because this is once you get all this done then that's when the real fun begins.\nSo does getting a pulse if I need to slow down or slow down a bit.\nOkay, I'll wait a bit again.\nraise your hand if you're stuck anywhere.\nQuestions, we have uh agents that can come around and support you.\nSo, I'm going to pause for a little bit.\nAny general questions while we're waiting?\nOh, yeah.\nSo, this workshop uh again all the code is available online.\nUh this workshop available as well.\nSo, you can also look through that.\nThere's a website called workshops.awws.\nAWS and when you go there you can do something like uh Nova act and then it's the only worktop that shows up.\nSo you can always go to workshops.Waww search nova act and this workshop will show up so you can see all the instructions all the code and run this uh on your own.\nOkay.\nAnd then the last thing, uh, because we're going to use Nova Act, we actually need to get a Novaact API key.\nSo, if you go to Nova, Amazon.com, it this is a website that you can use the Amazon Nova model.\nSo, you can do like chatting, generating images, uh, speaking with Nova, uh, generate videos, but then also this is where the the ACT API key is generated.\nSo, if you're following along and you want to generate your key, again, it's free to log in.\nYou can use your Amazon.com uh like when you order something on Amazon.com account to log into this and then you can just generate a key here and it'll be able to access that Oops.\nOkay.\nSo, I'm going to walk through what module one is.\nUh before I get has anybody got in here?\nJust quick pulse check.\nIf not, you know, I'll continue.\nI know the Wi-Fi is slow, so it might be hard.\nSo, I'll just continue on.\nUh but yeah, the first one we got to see how Nova Act works.\nUh how how the actual code looks like.\nUh generated the key.\nuh need to export the key and then kind of running the first script which is actually going to open amazon.com uh and we're actually going to look for the first coffee maker.\nSo let me see how that uh code looks like.\nLet's go here.\nMake this bigger.\nOops.\nSo very simple code uh with Nova Act it's again it's all on Python SDK I so I decide what a page to go to.\nSo go to amazon.com I say I want you to search for a coffee maker.\nI say select the first result and I say get the title of that product page.\nSo uh very simple if you ever done kind of web automation before of something like uh Selenium or\n\n\nPlayright, you probably have to like look for this diff tag, you know, look at this H1 tag, grab this information. A lot of manual processes of actually inspecting the actual website. Here, I'm just saying click the search bar, find something like I don't have to specify click this tag, do that. So it makes it much more easier to engage with the website as a natural human would instead of like looking through divs and trying to find this P tag specifically. So, uh, this is a great way to just, uh, you know, use Nova Act right out of the box. So I'm going to, uh, run this so we can see examples.\n\nAll right. All right. So, added my key. Going to what happens when I run this file. Give it a second. Oops, we failed. All right, let's start over. One. Ah, okay. I know. Got to run out of this. Let's start that over.\n\nYeah, question. So just to explain, why is Banjo running that command? It's running F XVFB. It's a frame buffer where it runs your X11 system. What happens there? Nova Act actually goes and clicks a mouse on a browser. That's why it needs to be run like that. Otherwise, it has no GUI. So this is just kind of a way to emulate, um, a graphical user interface on this Linux box. Thank you, Darko. Yeah, since we're running everything in the cloud on a browser, I'm saying, you know, open a browser again, but it's already in a browser. So that's why it crashed. So I had to put that frame buffer command. Uh, and yeah, the workshop kind of walks through why we did that. But you can see, uh, what is going on when Nova Act says, I'm going to search for a coffee maker. I'm at the Amazon homepage. My task is to search for this. So it's understanding what it's doing. I see the search spark has copy maker. I'm at the search spark here, and now it actually puts the actual log of the actual HTML file. So it's taking screenshots. You can see what it looks like. It got the first results. I'm on the copy maker page. It selected it. And now I got the title of the now it says, you know, what's the title of this product page? All right. Got this Black Decker 12 copy maker. My task to return the title of the product page product title. It got that and it ended the session, and then it also creates a video log that I can actually look at to see what it did for each for everything it did in this webm file.\n\nYeah. Question. Yeah. So the question was, does it reason about the page in terms of pixels or in terms of text? Yeah. So it's actually looking through the actual, uh, the page itself. So you see in this video, it sees it looks at the page. I can see what's in the page. So it's it's a large language model train. So it can actually see the actual the page is doing. So it's not looking at like like the H1 tag or whatnot. It understands the context of that particular page. It can see that's a search box. Okay, I'm going to go click through that search box. So yes, it understands the pixel level of what's on that actual page.\n\nSo this is kind of the video. It's hard to see. Make it bigger. Sped up. So, it opens the page. It goes to the is able to type in coffee maker there. Um, it gets that information, clicks the button. So, even with all the ads and everything, the video can understand the task, clicks that, and it gets the information back. So, that's and that was a couple lines of code. So, you can extrapolate to other type of workflows you can do for searching through things.\n\nSorry, I have a and I have a question. Yeah. So when you what I have experienced with these kind of frameworks is that when you run this on a server environment, um, services like Cloudflare will block the access and maybe do a capture challenge. How do we solve that using Q? Yeah. So with, uh, so using Amazon Nova, so it doesn't do captures. It doesn't do things of that nature. So it's it's meant for like workflows you understand, but yes, it's not going to bypass captures and other things of that nature as well. So it's made for like going to amazon.com or look through a booking site. But if something that's like requires like a human or it wants to, you can't bypass that. You wouldn't use Nova Act for that use case. If you need to pass a capture of something else, that use another technology. This is not meant to like overtake humans, you know, it's more like I'm helping them augment things, but not if there's a capture involved, then you have to use a different technology for that. It's also a preview. It's also a preview. Yes. So this is a research preview as well. So if that's a very good use case, you know, leave feedback on the Nova the website. So is is human and loop possible at all with it yet? Well, with this this one, it's no, because I'm writing all the code here. So but again, this is Python code. So I could probably put in something here like, you know, ask something, make an API call here. So this is, you know, it's a Python code. You might be able to create some type of, uh, workflow that might augment like wait for a human response or whatnot because the browser is happening in like headless mode, but could you make it work with a browser to human is also seeing at the same time? Yes. So it can pause and wait for somebody put in like a password or credentials or do a capture, and then once it receives that, works continue on the workflow. You could do, yeah, because right now I I ran it in headless mode, but yes, it can also run, uh, you know, it would open up the browser. If I ran this on my MacBook, I would open up a Chrome browser and go through that session. Also, if you're running it and you wanted to bypass something that has two factor, if you're already logged into say Amazon.com and then you run a code, it's going to use your credentials in that browser session to continue on to perform that task. So, that's something that you can do as well.\n\nCool. So, let me Oops. And then one other thing you can also do multi, uh, you know, parallel execution. So my last my next example is actually I'm trying to find multiple monitors and I wanted to compare them all at once. So I'll show you how that code looks like so I can check for the monitor extract information. I'm setting, you know, I want I'm defining what I want. So again, I'm, you know, saying I want to find the price, the rating, the size. Uh, go to amazon.com. Uh, I set it headless mode this time. So I don't need to do the frame buffer. I start multiple threads. It looks for each monitor simultaneously because each of these are individual tasks. So I can paralyze them instead of waiting it to to go through. I I define the list of monitors I want to go through, start the thread, and then it starts executing and finds the the results of the monitors. So I can run that in the background. So starting the three parallel threads, and it's so again, it's running in headless mode, so it's going to be able to do this in the background where we can see kind of what the model is thinking, how it navigates through the web page.\n\nYep. I I have tried to use Nova, uh, in the past, April, and, uh, it worked for the first time, but once I did it again, it triggered the capture. Is this something that has been already resolved or is this happening because I think the website, and it was Amazon in this case, it was detecting it was a bot, and, uh, is there like an LLM.txt or robots.txt txt that can declare it? So Nova actor is a GitHub repo. So you could go there and just grab that. But it's it's working now. Like I'm running it, you know, I just I this is just live code I'm doing right now. Like, uh, I just exported my API key, started running it. So, uh, you can try it in the workshop. Yeah, I mean it's it's ready to go. We're building right now. And you can kind of see that it's going on in the background what it's doing. Uh, I've looked at this monitor, the Dell monitor. I'm at the Amazon homepage. It's like it's going through looking through the search results. It's saving things. So, you can see it's running in parallel. It got the information for the one of the first ones. So, it's going as I just set that up and it can execute that. So, if you have some type of, uh, I don't know, like daily news thing. You need to go to the website and get news or something and like have a report, Nova, and there's no API for that. This is one way you can encodify how to do that kind of search and get the information.\n\nHave a question. Yeah. I'm wondering, so how successful is this in terms of like more ambiguous tests because I I ran the Amazon demo and that worked, but I'm wondering, could I just add Google there and and how like how vague and sort of how much does it know when it's navigating through, like I was thinking, like if I wanted to return a pair of sunglasses that broke, would I would I be able to just say like start in Google and then find this company's website, find a way to, you know, engage support, open a ticket, like how much sort of like how vague can you be and how smart is it currently? Would that would that, yeah, I mean, the more instruction you give, obviously, the better, but it's able to understand how to navigate a website. That's what the model's trained on. So if you say, you know, go to this sunglasses website, it doesn't, it probably wasn't trained on a specific sunglass website, but it can understand that button support, you know, this, but click a ticket, so understand kind of the the general knowledge of how to navigate the website, but if there's something very intricate about that website, you're going to have to encode it in the text, like make sure you click button an experts or whatever. So, it understands how to navigate websites. Got it. And does it understand when it's failed? Yeah, sometime, sometimes I've seen it sometimes get stuck in a loop and like, oh no, I keep scrolling. I keep scrolling. I keep scrolling. It doesn't know when to stop. So, it again, this is in research preview, so things are getting better. The model's getting updated behind the scenes, but it's not like it's not AGI. So, that's got it. And one last question. Um, h how is it in terms of navigating like distrustful parts of the internet? I mean, there's a lot on the internet that we see and we know is not to be trusted or it's something not to be followed. H how have you sort of worked around that problem? Yeah, because again, it is a model in the background, so it's going to understand like if you're doing something, it's not going to want to click that or might be there safeguards in place. So that's built into the model, but again, uh, it is in research preview. You still have to explicitly say what buttons to press for certain actions, but again, the model it isn't LLM trained. is going to be able to understand the nuances and say if it can't take this action or can't do that, that that could happen. But I haven't seen that use case. But if you keep pushing it, maybe you'll find those those things. Well, the thing I had in my mind is like if you go to a site where you have to download a link, sometimes there's an ad that says download a link, and you know that that's just an ad trying to get your attention, would the model know or is that some is that like for example, like in the the Amazon.com, it shows an ad for something, but it said find the first thing. I was able to scroll past that ad and click something. So the model understands the task you give it. So yes, it can understand that. Thank you.\n\nAll right. So this this just finished. Yeah, that's really quick. It showed it was able to find all the models, give me the size, the rating, the price for each of the monitors. So again, it it executed that on parallel. It got me the nice information. And that that's kind of the idea of like it can do parallel execution in the background. So you don't have to wait for it and don't see it actually clicking through the the task and you get your information.\n\nAll right, one more question, then we'll move on to the MCP part. Banjo. Yep. Nova Act is only available in US. Yes. Right now, Nova Act is only available in the US. It's in preview, so it's just getting started. So, if you log in from like a different, uh, account like address like UK or something, it might not it won't work. So, it only works in the US at the moment. Yes. Right. One more question over there, and then I'm going to move on.\n\nSamsung might be Oh. [Laughter] Your Amazon.com is different. I don't know. Yeah, because it is opening up a different browser. So, it could have clicked something differently. Yeah. So, yeah, that's right. Look at the video preview video playback to see what your results were. Right. Yeah. Oh, one more. Okay. One more quick quick one. Are there plans to support persisting browsing data such as cookies in the cloud browser? So right now it's opening up its own, uh, browser, but you can also set like your own like Chromium profile and open up that browser. So everything you have saved there, like if you want to log into your stuff, you can set your own custom browser, but by default it opens up a new like completely new browser without anything saved.\n\nAll right. So I want to show, uh, I actually made an MCP server for Nova ACT. So a module tool is\n\n\nGoing through, uh, MCP, and I can kind of show you what I did for the MCP server. Uh, in fact, we can use Amazon Q here. So I'm going to ask it, uh, can you tell me about the Nova Act MCP server? Tell me what it does, and oops. So tell me about the Nova Act MCP server. So you can see it's going through, um, integrates Nova Act browser and MCP. It has the browse session tool, browser action, execute parallel task, take screenshots, close browser, list results. So I created these different aspects of the MTCP server. So I can use something like Claw Desktop or Cursor or Amazon QCLI to say, you know, open Amazon.com and find information for me. So it's portable. It understands, uh, so I don't have to actually write code. I can say, so go to amazon.com and find me the co the first coffee maker. It will actually write all that code I did in the initial one to do that or the multimonitor. So I wrote a bunch of code to do this. If I just said, you know, get me these three monitors to get the price, it would actually write all the Nova Act code it needs to do that using the MCP server. So that's kind of the power of MCP that I just describe a task, and then I can, it will encode the actual browse action things it needs to. So, and I also made an MCP client that can actually interpret that. So, oops, uh, it connects to the MCP server, it runs the code, and it's able to use query Bedrock. Uh, I am using a model, so I'm using Claude 3.5 Sonnet here because I'm is an MCP client and needs to have an LLM behind that, and then it's able to, you know, understand which tools to use, uh, run the code and open up the browser and whatnot. So let me just run the example here. So module two. So, we are open the file. Just did that. We ask Amazon Q to explain the file to us. And now we're actually going to run it. So Python 3. And then I can open this up. Okay. So, let's be adventurous. So, somebody give me a query to try since anyone has an idea. Yeah, I'm going to just ask it and do something. So, someone give me an idea of what to run another act. Fix Wi-Fi. Uh, how would you fix the Can you find a website to find fix website? Can find, let's see, website to fix Wi-Fi, use headless mode. I spelled it wrong, but let's see. All right, goes to google.com, how to fix Wi-Fi problems troubleshooting guide in the box and press enter, return a list of the websites title descriptions. All right, it's going through that. So, it opened google.com. Uh, how to fix Wi-Fi problems. I see an empty search bar where I can type queries for search information. I should type how to fix Wi-Fi problem. So, you can see it's understanding what to do. It, oh, it hit a recapture page. So, okay, the search results are not viewable. Blah, blah. So, so see, it looks like it got stuck on a recapture page. So, this is like a headless agent. So, someone asked a question about, can I pass captures? What now? You see that it's, it got stuck doing that. It looks like it's stuck in a loop now. So, it sees the capture again. So, I should skip the clip button to skip the capture window. The capture is still open. So, it, it's probably going to be stuck here unless I close it. So, you can see there are limitations. It's not going to pass captures and whatnot. But that, that was a good query to show that it, oh, did it fill it? It's still open. So, it's going to be stuck here. So, I'm just going to close it out. But you can see, you know, it, it can't pass everything, and can't navigate through websites. So something like that was will not work. So that was a great test example to show. If I use the the baked-in one, you know, find that copy m under $50, it'll be able to go through that and use headless mode. But any questions on that? Seeing how the MCP server is working. I didn't have to write code. I just said do something. It actually wrote the code to to do it for me. Question over here. Yeah. Yeah. So, a question about if I can actually go into the browser and do it myself. Yeah. If I ran this locally on my machine, it'll actually be able to, it'll open up the browser and I can actually click the button, and it'll continue doing that. Right now, I'm running it within the browser. So, I'm de everything in headless mode. So, we can't interact with that. So, you can see it's able to find search under $50. It can actually look at the website. It's found search results on Amazon.com. So yeah, so that for that use case where we're not passing captures is able to continue and find the information there. So a question about can I actually order something? If I used my own browser session and like logged in at to my Amazon.com account and said, yes, order this for me, you know, click through, it'll be able to understand that thing. But I would have to put in, I would have to use my own browser sessions, like I wouldn't want to log in by myself. Yeah. A question. If you give Nova Act the authentication for Amazon, for example, like you give it your login details, then can it log in and complete that action for you? Yeah, if I, if I like say, this is my username, this is my password, enter that into that field, and you'll be able to understand, you know, this is a sign-in button, and I have this information. But again, this is all Python code. So yeah, you can encode it, you can make it an environment variable, so it won't read it directly. So a lot of ways to do that. Does it also like understand 2FA? Let's say it asks you to go to your Gmail, and you will, it then open the Gmail website, check the email if you're logged in again on your session, and then input it, or is it, and you can, well, if there's no capture, like we just thought of the capture. Yeah. So there's no nothing blocking. So, but yeah, again, Nova Act is free to use. So there's a lot of creativity in this room. So I think we should have like a Nova Act hackathon. I think that would be, you know, do something crazy with Nova Act. All right. So, one more question. Yep. One more. Can I book a flight when my price alert is less than $100? It's like a continuously check. You could probably use something else for that. But yeah, I mean, nobody can open up that website. You can just have a query every day, you know, open Google flights and look at the quickest things, and if something is below this threshold, you know, send me an email. So, again, this is all a Python script. So, you can set up something that triggers like once a day, like in a lambda function, and so yes, totally possible. So, Nova Act is very flexible, and because it can run in headless mode, you don't need to have that UI. So, that's really what makes it helpful for interacting with websites that don't have a native API. Thanks. Yeah, this is pretty cool. I'm a little bit confused. Like, we have the Nova SDK SDK API key, and we were also doing some stuff in Bedrock. Ah, yeah. So how does this actually work? Yeah. Yeah. So in the the Nova API key separate, but for this MCP client, I did, it actually needs a large thing with model to understand what's still happening. So if I go to Claude, oops, I actually said I'm actually using Claude Sonnet 3.5 for my MCP server. So that's how, because I just asked it, you know, find that website for me. How, how does it know that without any of the code doing that? So it's using a large language model underneath the hood to actually find that information. So that's where we use Bedrock for trying to find it in the code, but Sonnet. Yeah, I set the model ID. So you're an AI system helping you have tools, you're using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. You're making an API call a Bedrock whenever something happens. So that's where the the LLM we're using. But Nova Act is separate from that. So this MC, like if you're using, you know, Claw Desktop, it's running an LLM inside of that to be able to understand that for the MCP server. Question here. Question. Uh, the question is, uh, does it integrate with browser plugins as well? Like could it integrate with LastPass? If you have the LastPass plugin, fill in the credentials through LastPass and then continue. I haven't tried that. But again, it does, you can set up to use your own browser. So if you do that and that's integrated, it might be able to do that and click through that. But I have not tested that, but something to try out. Thank you. And the biggest problem you would face is two-factor. Like even if you gave it a password, like if you're using something like Google Authenticator or something, that would be like the biggest problem or capture, but other than that, if you provide it environmental variable, or if you give it instructions on how to access LastPass in the browser, it should be able to do it. Right, and, uh, oh, one more question, then we'll go on to the last module. So clearly there are a lot of different, uh, agent architectures you could use. Um, and I can imagine using this as, uh, like you have a coordinator agent set up somewhere that's running in the overall app, and then when something pops up and says, hey, you need to go and look this up online, go and check it. Uh, it should mod, so my question is how modular it, I mean, it's just Python, so it should be pretty modular, right? Is that the way in which you're imagining the architecture to be, is just if I was coding a coordinator agent in LangChain or LangGraph, for example, it would then call your sub agent and get and and run its stuff and then get and then get a text-based output that I throw into my message queue, that's how it all integrates together, is that right? Yeah, that's one way you can do it. So, Nova Act, again, right? It's just Python. So, it could be a tool, it could be an API call. And the next module, we're actually going to show you how to actually make an agent from that. So, good, good tea app right here. Uh, so Dan talked about the strands, uh, at the beginning. So, strands is a new agentic framework launched by, uh, AWS. So, let me open up the link. Uh, it's easy as a pip install strands, and the first agent is like agent equals that. So it's very, it's a model-first, uh, way of interacting with agents. If you use a lot of agent frameworks in the past, there's a lot of bootstrapping and making sure everything is correct and like, but that was necessary for kind of the older models, like if you think back to like, like Llama 2, for example, like how, how far models have evolved since then. So, but now we, we can pass a lot of the, you know, bootstrapping we did previously. The agent can figure that out. So we don't need all these very, uh, heavy weights and like, you know, make sure everything's typed and every so whatnot. So here's a very simple example of how I actually spun up, uh, and also it has MCP native support. So in this example, I actually have two MCP servers. Uh, I have the AWS documentation and AWS diagrams MCP server. So if you go to this like AWS Labs MCP, these are their official, um, AWS MCP servers, and there's a bunch of different ones from like a cost analysis, Nova Canvas, diagramming, cloud form, uh, lots of different ones here. Uh, so again, it's all on GitHub, AWS Labs, MCP, but the example I do here is I'm actually, uh, I made like a solutions architect agent. Your role is to help customers understand is building on AWS. And I define these two MCP servers here. I give it the prompt, and I say this agent has all the tools in the MCP server. It has a Bedrock model. I'm using Claude Haiku here. And what's cool about strand is it can also use like Light LLM and O Lama. So it has access to launch of different things, or you can run it locally, and of course, it has access to Amazon Bedrock. So that's what we're using here. So all those three things makes the agent, the tools, the model, and the system prompt. And then I can say, uh, get the documentation for AWS Lambda and create a diagram of a website that uses Lambda. So let me run this code. CD. Okay. Okay, so it uses UV to install the MCP server locally. A lot of people, I, where does MCP run? This is running locally, but there are other ways to run it, like in a lambda function and whatnot. But for just testing it out, it pulls down the the MCP server locally and runs it. And you can see it's already executing. So let's make this a bit bigger. Uh, so it says, okay, I'm going to help you with that. First, I'm going to search the AWS Lambda documentation, uh, read the documentation, then I'll create a diagram illustrating a static site. So you can see it does a post request to do the search. So the MCP server defines where everything is. I don't have to like feed it in the well-architected framework. The AWS documentation is always updated. So it just knows called the search function. It got the Lambda welcome file. It, it put that in. It's able to generate the diagram. It, it generates the diagram. It tells us what is going on, how the workflow looks like. It tells me it saved the diagram to this location. I can open it up. Generated diagrams. Oops. And oh, it's very small. Let me see if I can make this bigger. There you go. So, it was able to generate the diagram for me. So, all through that about, uh, you know, 40 lines of code. I have two MCP servers. I have my prompt, and it's able to understand that, get that, and just generate something for me with that. Uh, so that's very easy to get started with strands of building a agentic workflows. I know agent means a lot of different things to different people, but you know, you have tools, the model, the system prompt, do some type of action, and strands makes it extremely easy to do that. If I use other frameworks, it could be a lot more code to do something like that, especially integrating MCP natively like that. I'm going to pause here for any strands questions. It's coming. Um, I know Bedrock already had it kind of agents SDK. So is strands replacing that or is this now the, is this replacing that or is it supposed to complement that? Like, is this the preferred\n\n\nWay of creating agents with models in Bedrock?\nYeah.\nWell, when it comes to preferred way, it always comes down to your use case.\nSo the Bedrock agent has a lot more, I guess, opinionated ways to do things.\nYou can do it through the console.\nIt has built-in support right there in AWS.\nWell, Strand is more as an open-source framework.\nSo you can download the code, you can use other models through that, like Light LLM.\nIf you use Bedrock agent, you can't run that offline.\nSo there's different use cases, different developer tooling.\nI mean, me as a software engineer, I like, you know, code first doing things.\nSo it does depend on your use case, what you're trying to do in your experience.\nCan you show the code real quick?\nYeah.\nYeah, this is the code.\nYeah, just show the agent.\nSo, this is an open-source framework.\nIf you go where it says agent, you and it says model.\nRight now, we're using a Bedrock model, but you can use another model with Light LLM.\nYep.\nSo, you don't need AWS at all in that instance.\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo there's documentation, Anthropic, Light LLM, uh, lot of different model providers, Lama, OpenAI.\nSo it's an open-source framework, so you can use it whatever you want.\nSo, but yeah, that's the idea with Strand, open-source model agent development kit.\nOne question, suppose I want to build a tax-to-SQL agent and I have, um, say 15 tools already built in that I want this agent to be able to use.\nIf I use this framework, um, how can I make sure that the agent knows when to use the right tool and the sequence?\nYeah, great question.\nUh, so I did this example, I have a weather agent.\nSo one thing you said you already have tools.\nWhat I like about Strange a lot is I can write a Python function I already have and let's put this tool decorator and that's it.\nYou know, you don't have to put anything else.\nIt understands this is the, uh, what you need to do, and then when I'm going to that agent, I have this tools, and it has put in the the native tools we're going to be using.\nHTTP request is a as a standard tool in the Strands framework.\nSo in this example, I'm like asking what is the weather in Seattle and then also how many words are in this response, uh, this open API, uh, API, weather.gov, gov, where you don't need an API key and it can find the information for you.\nSo, I'm gonna just update this San Francisco and this show wrong, but it's a figure it out.\nWeather example, weather word count.\nAnd I was very specific, you know, find the weather first and then how many words are in the response.\nSo, it's able to use that tool.\nIt gets the forecast and then it knows to use that word count tool next.\nSo, we're passing a lot of the information to the model.\nThe models are very smart now.\nWe don't have to say do this, do this, do this.\nThe let the agent figure it out.\nThat's kind of the goal of the agent.\nYou give it the context and the tools necessary, it figures out the best way to solve the problem.\nBut then wouldn't it be prone to hallucination when you give it 20 tools and then because we've tried that with AWS, you know, the similar things when you bind more, I think more than 10 tools, it's going to, sure, there's always, you know, a balance, but I again, the models are much better, like try using Claw Force on it.\nIs it hallucinating as much?\nLike these newer models are much better for understanding the concept and understanding what tools when.\nThe older models, sure, they get confused.\nThere's so many things.\nBut I'm very confident on these newer models, they can understand your use case and what tools available and figure out the best way to solve the problem.\nSo then with this framework, there wouldn't be a way for you to orchestrate a customized flow, but more like you give the control to the agent.\nYou could, if you want to have like specific, like do this specific way, uh, there are different ways in Strands, uh, with something called workflow mode, where you actually say, uh, you know, this is the workflow I want to do, research results, analyze things, write a final report.\nIf you have to do something very sequential, Strands has that.\nI won't have time to go through all the different, you know, ways to do multi-agent collaboration and whatnot, but this for that particular, like I wanted to do XYZ first, the workflow way can do that.\nSo yes, then is it possible, say, um, I, I don't have a predefined workflow, but I know it needs to figure out the right workflow, then then that's what I just did there.\nYou know, I just gave it a sentence and figured it out.\nI see.\nI see.\nOkay, perfect.\nThank you.\nOn it, but um, Cloud 4 has something called interleaving thinking.\nI believe that's what it's called, where it can handle multiple tools processing much better than most models today.\nSo if you're passing in 20 tools, it's able to work through the agentic loop to really figure out which tool to run.\nAnd it's also able to run parallel tool calls.\nSo rather than just say, okay, here's the objective, let me run this tool.\nIt can say, here's the objective, let me run this tool, this tool, this tool, then this tool, and then process the results and determine what needs to happen next.\nSo I would try a Cloud 4, which he like Banjo mentioned.\nThen last example really quick.\nUh, again, you know, Strands, I made my Nova Act MCP server, and it can actually run that, you know, I define this is the MCP server, use the Nova MCP, you know, use the cloud.\nSo same type of thing, I can have another agent, you know, use, uh, Nova Act as well.\nUh, so Strands make it very easy to build these agentic workflows.\nUh, so that's really, really enjoy the the developer experience of using Strands, and you know, I already have the MCP server.\nWe see the same exact example before.\nSo once you have the MCP server, it's very easy to plug in into different, uh, architectures and Strands makes it very easy to to accept that.\nUh, but yeah, those were the three modules really about how to use Strands.\nUh, MCP, then Amazon Nova Act.\nAgain, uh, Strand is open source.\nYou can download it, pip install strands.\nUh, if you just type strandagents.com, it'll take you to the documentation.\nAgain, also Nova Act, nova.amazon.com, it's free and log in.\nAnd then think that's all the time we have, but we do have a a survey, uh, and you can get AWS credit code by filling out this survey.\nSo I, I have a question about that workflow thing in, uh, Strands, when you create these individual agents, can you define which tools are passed on to each agents?\nYeah, yeah, it's a great question.\nDark about different agents, we're running out of time, but I'll quickly show, uh, I have a multi-agent example, I believe.\nOh, I think you had it in the docs.\nYeah.\nYeah, it's in the docs.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nEach of these is a different agent.\nSo, you know, this is an agent.\nYou can have a different system prompt.\nYou can have different tools.\nSo you're just defining the agent and then yeah, you can have different tools, different whatever, there different models, and then the workflow would just call that.\nSo yes, completely customizable.\nSo that's the good thing about Strand.\nIt's very easy to customize and build scalable solutions like that.\nThank you.\nAnd then again, uh, here's the survey.\nYou can get AWS credits for filling out this thing.\nTell us how we did, what you liked, what you want to learn more.\nAnd now go build.\n[Applause]\nYeah.\nAny other questions while we wait?\nI think we have a minute.\nThanks for the presentation.\nUm, so as these systems develop, I think that it's reasonable to assume that, um, they would emerge as an increasingly effective vehicle for committing fraud online at scale, which would push businesses to implement, uh, more things like capture, which kind of decreases the surface area that tools like this would be applicable.\nSo what is the long-term strategy for that?\nWell, you already saw we failed to capture today.\nLike, you know, we're not trying to b capture.\nWe're not trying to break things.\nYou know, a responsible AI is very important to Amazon.\nSo, no, we're not trying to let this tool commit fraud.\nYou know, you have to have an API key, so it could be monitored.\nSo, use cases like that will be shut down.\nWe think we're done.\nYeah.\nSo, thank you all.\nI think it's finished.\nOh, we can keep going.\nWe have more time.\nOh, the clock, the clock ran out.\nSo, I thought we were kicked out.\nAll right.\nWell, more questions then, I guess.\nI thought Yeah, another question.\nUm, so regarding Nova Act, let's say that I have a headless browser in the cloud.\nIs there a way to connect Nova Act to my custom browser instance in the cloud?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYou can, there's a way to like put your own browser instance.\nSo yeah, Nova supports that.\nSo possible.\nYeah.\nThanks.\nLet me go to Novak GitHub page.\nAnd just some examples there.\nSo yeah, there's a way to set up your own user agent for Nova app.\nDefinitely possible.\nQuestions.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nWell, apparently I have still more time.\nSo, I don't know if anyone actually got into the workshop.\nSo, we can still, uh, build some stuff or I can try some other examples.\nTry to make Nova Act.\nI tried to make a Streamllet app with Nova Ax.\nSo, we can try if that works.\nOops.\nSo, one example I tried, I tried to make a Streamllet app that, uh, look for like the top five, uh, PlayStation games on game FAQs and then create an image like a nice graph for me, but it, it can fail.\nSo, uh, I think that's one of the issues there.\nI think it failed at one of the steps there.\nUh, let's see.\nOh, that Nova app got an error.\nSo, it couldn't navigate game faqs.com.\nSo, it does, it does fail at some of the things.\nSo, that's, you know, again, research preview.\nYou have to be more specific on how it goes through things.\nUh, but yeah, let me show you where the the code is, just so you can have an example.\nLet me pull up the code.\nYeah, let me try, let me set up my local machine so we can see how it works.\nYeah.\nOh, yeah.\nGo for it.\nHow much does Nova Act depend on like, uh, semantic HTML and like good web design to actually work?\nI mean, it understands the actual page, so it can click through those things.\nBut if the, if the page like doesn't have like a search box or button and not be able to navigate.\nSo as long as the p, it can see the page, understand where to click and then click those correct buttons.\nSo maybe a follow is there any like efforts to do like experimental like engagement on the page?\nSo if it comes on a page that it's not familiar with, maybe it would try and act like a human would to like click on things or try things out depending what you, you put in that prompt, because again, you're creating that workflow what it should do.\nSo if you say, you know, explore this website and find things, it will, it'll try to click through that.\nBut again, it's up to kind of what that initial prompt is that you have for it.\nYeah.\nWhen you're using overact, you're kind of giving it step-by-step instructions when you're using the SDK.\nSo that way, if you kind of know it's an obscure website, you can give it those instructions that it need to perform rather than the MCP server, um, is using natural language to infer what needs to be done.\nSo it's not specific instructions coming from you unless you provide it.\nYeah.\nSo, I'm going to run it locally on my machine just to show an example.\nUh, let's see.\nOh, let me hide my key for a second because it's been recorded.\nPython get coffee.\nThanks for coming.\nAll right.\nSo, I'm just running it locally on my machine.\nSo, without headless mode, so you can see it opens up the browser.\nIt's able to type coffee maker.\nSo what we're looking at now is not in headless mode.\nThis is actually Nova Act actually performing the task in a browser.\nSo yeah, a lot of questions about how does it work, you know, and we can try more complicated examples.\nI just wanted to show it could work on your machine and you can see the log.\nYou know, I'm looking for, and if I like change the page while it's doing something, it's going to like mess up.\nSo, I'm going to click the page and see what it does.\nLike, so someone asked about click things of that nature.\nWhat's it going to do now?\nSo see it crashed now because I brought, I changed a different page, didn't know what to do.\nSo example, you can interact with it when it's going through the motion as well.\nAnd then I believe I have an, uh, can the MCP server, I set up a cloud instance.\nOops.\nAnd then I have a my Nova Act MCP server is there.\nSo I'm able to actually, you know, I click this, you can see all the tools it has available.\nSo I can ask it to like navigate a website.\nSo, uh, anyone have a complex example?\nYou can see the MCP server.\nSo I know some people have been asking some complex examples.\nSo get, go ahead and give me one here.\nYou got, you got one.\nYou can try it.\nDo you have a specific website that has like drag and drop?\nDraw.io.\nUh, let's go to draw.io.\nio and make a cool diagram.\nUse Nova Act.\nLet's see what happens.\nAll right.\nSo, let's go to draw IO.\nAll right.\nIt opened the page.\nDo I have to accept something?\nNope.\nIt's going.\nOops.\nAll right.\nOpen dry.io.\nLet's see.\nMake this smaller.\nWait for page to load.\nLook at my initial setup for template selections.\nAll right, it's going.\nUh.\nOh, it crashed.\nWhat happened?\nOh, do I have to allow, allow always?\nOh, it took a screenshot.\nI need to continue the browser session to see what's available.\nLet's look at the screenshot.\nAll right, it's opening up again.\nUh, it's going to draw.io.\nYeah, if I keep clicking away, it clicks back to the di the browser session.\nSo, I need like two monitors.\nSee, is it going to figure out how to use draw io?\nWait for pay.\nTake screenshot.\nLook for template options.\nCome with blank pay.\nAll right.\nIt's so it's kind of, I didn't give it any specific instructions.\nI just said make something cool.\nSo maybe that's too hard to interpret for this website.\nMaybe I have to say click this, click the square button and then drag the square to the center or something.\nI might have to been more explicit for that.\nIt seems, it seems to\n\n\nHave frozen.\n\nAll right, it's clicking something.\nAll right, click new.\nOh, okay.\nHey, it's doing stuff again.\nIt's not like super real time.\nIt's going.\nIt's not like instantaneously, but it it's it is clicking through the buttons, clicking through stuff.\nAll right.\nDid it do anything?\nOh, the CL.\nSo, it looks like it fa So, yeah, looks like Claude failed that one.\nSo, I won't blame Nova for that.\nBut that's the that's the idea.\nSo, thanks for trying to do something hard.\nAll right, another question back there.\nOh, yeah.\nCan we can Can we try another one?\nYeah, let's try another one.\nSure.\nCan we do um you know on Google Maps, find the top three rated coffee shops with within a mile radius of this hotel.\nTop three coffee shops shops near the Marriott Marquees in San Francisco.\nYou'll figure it out.\nAll right.\nOpen Maps Google.\nSearch Mary Marque San Francisco.\nWait for results to load.\nSo, it has a plan.\nIt's going to do something.\nSo, let's see.\nIt opened Google Maps.\nAll right.\nType MQ San Francisco.\nSo, it's able to type that.\nOkay.\nIt searched.\nIt found the Marquee.\nSo, there's a copy button.\nLet's see if it clicks that.\nI'm curious.\nLooks like it's frozen.\nGive it a couple more seconds.\nWhat did it click?\nIt got this 15 minutes.\nI was trying to type in that box.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nJust type in coffee shops.\nAll right.\nAll right.\nIt's going.\nAll right.\nSo, all right.\nIt'll open the coffee shops and let's see if we can get those top three.\nThere's a 48 47 another 47.\nLet's see if it can get that.\nDid it crash?\nI think it did it, but I think I'm going to blame Claude.\nCloud desktop crashes.\nmight need a zip MCP client.\nUh yeah,\nI think yeah, I think Claude Desktop doesn't like doing that.\nBut again, because it's an MCP server, I can open up a different MCP client.\nSo I can open like cursor, for example, and ask it questions through that cursor.\nLet me close this.\nAnd then you see it has the MCP tools.\nOops, it has this up.\nLet me just open up a new one.\nI can do the same thing and use Nova Act and then it's calling the MCP tool again.\nSo that's the beauty of MCP.\nI already have this server.\nI can just use a different client.\nIt can understand all the information it needs to and do the exact same command.\nSo it's going to do the same thing.\nCursor might be smarter than cloud code.\nBut yeah, it's able to do the exact same type of thing.\nSo a question over here.\nYeah, I just got a question.\nYeah.\nYes.\nSo Novak's question was where is Novak running?\nAnd yes, it's running in the cloud.\nSo yeah, it's just you get that API key and it's doing the call behind the scenes in AWS cloud.\nYeah.\nSo then what what does it upload to the cloud?\nWell, it's asking the the questions and like you know go to Google Maps and then they say I understand that and it's actually clicking those buttons and doing the actions.\nSo the the actual uh intent of what you're trying to do in the specific action and if I was using it locally, you couldn't use Nova Act locally.\nIt has to be uh connected to the internet to use it.\nOkay.\nBut if I for example if I wanted to look my\nYes.\nAh yeah I I see what you're saying.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIf you I mean it is you know it's a API endpoint.\nIt's been passed to AWS.\nSo you know only pass information that you feel like it's not going to be we're not training the data or taking any of that nature but it's going to the AWS cloud and processing you know what to click on this button locally on your like browser.\nSo looks like it's not.\nYeah.\nSee, now it's even certain the rating.\nIt actually knows which rating to press.\nSo So the Nova Act is going to just give the plan, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWell, when Nova Act is is executing like in this MCP server example, I say, you know, find the top three copy stops in Marriott near the Marriott marquee and then I'm passing that information to the the LLM to understand that plan and then it uses Nova Act to interact with the browser because like cursor or cloud code or Amazon Q, they can't interact with the specific uh you know website by itself.\nIt uses it uses Nova Act to do that, right?\nBut like given a question though like how how does it come uh come up with a plan?\nOh the MCP server like the the client so I picked the model in the example we had the MCP client we had this we showed the model I don't use cloud 3.5 that's coming up with the plan same thing here you know I asked you know help me find the top three copies of native Mario marquee this the model that uh cursor is using is coming up with that plan and then I'm using the Nova Act MCP server to act on it.\nExactly.\nSo this is the plan.\nSearch for Mary Marquee.\nClick the mirror marquee you know search for the things and you see all this information Nova Act returned and it actually it returned this time.\nSo I think the problem was with claw desktop but it got the three top three copy stops there.\nRight.\nWhat are all the tools that uh Nova Act can do today.\nUh so the MCP server is what I wrote.\nSo uh but the idea between Nova Act it can interface with the web browser that that's the tool.\nThe browser is the tool and it can anything that on the website can actually click through, go through the example, etc.\nI see.\nYou got the repo.\nDo you got an architecture that shows the MCP just so they can see it?\nYeah.\nSo, I mentioned uh there's an official AWS MCP servers.\nSo, uh this AWS Labs MCP and a lot of different um MCP servers here.\nFor the one, the Nova Act one, I created my own one.\nuh go back to the Nova Act examples or where do the ah here when I use Amazon to explain you know the am the MCP server for like what what's going on what tool was the browser session performing an action on the browser so this is a good uh thing to talk about so can you dive deeper on the browser action function and then we can see because this is how it's actually acting So, uh, Amazon Q browser action is designed to perform actions.\nIt has this, uh, what's cool about it, it just does, oops, let's go into the code.\nIt performs a single action in the Nova Act browser.\nSo, it's executing that action.\nIt stores this act.\nAct is like what Nova says you know click the search bar do this XY you know why the MCP client understands how to use this act that passes the correct action so we saw the example here one of the actions was like go to Google maps or click this button or do that search that's how it's able you know these actions and then the Nova Act MCP server is translating that to actually click that button so the MCP server provides all the interfaces it necessarily needs So then these MCP clients can interact and do actions and do things.\nYeah.\nAnd Nova Act is just the model in the background that's able to click those buttons.\nExtending this question, it so your MCP server so claw uh or um cursor running locally, right?\nIt's calling your MCP server that's also running locally.\nIs your MCP and your MCP server is the one that spun up the I guess the Chromium instance, right?\nIs it is your MCP server taking screenshots of what you see in Chromium and shipping them to Nova to Nova Act?\nThe screenshots are locally and then based on that like you can see it's actually getting all the information uh the final page information.\nSo it's not storing your screenshot data and sending that everything that it's running locally and it's clicking those buttons based on what's on the browser sensing.\nGot it.\nBut is is any of any of the information in Chromium does that any of that need to be sent into any form?\nEverything running Yes.\nrunning locally.\nI have the distinction.\nOkay, perfect.\nThank you.\nAnd let me open up the\nWhere's that looking?\nSo one of the things about making MCP servers is you have to provide a lot of context.\nSo uh for no act like I say you know when writing action for no action be descriptive of what to do you know click the hamburger menu icon go to order history don't find my order.\nSo the more you know uh concise and prescriptive what you want to do it's better you know search for hotels in Houston sort by average customer like so the better specific it is uh that's how the MCP uh client is able to make those great requests and find the information so type coffee maker search block enter so so the more prescriptive you are of Nova Act the better results you're going to be and I encoded that all into this uh MCP server so the clients can leverage that so I think that's Probably one of the hardest things about making the MCP servers that's making sure you provide a next context of when to use the tool, how to use the tool, the inputs and outputs.\nBut once you solve all that, it's very easy to plug and play to different MCP clients like we've done here.\nquestion.\nYeah.\nRight.\nSo when Nova Act is doing something, it's passing back the log of everything it's doing.\nSo you know what what steps it did.\nSo the starting page, the act the results, the action result ID.\nSo it's keeping a log of everything it did.\nUh power.\nSo it's able to get that JSON to understand what the ID what the result is.\nSo you can see what it's doing so it can move on to the next step.\nYep.\nMake this bigger.\nA question.\nSorry, a quick question.\nYeah.\nIs this able to do uh like uh automated UI testing because of this?\nWell, with Nova, you know, you can define like what you want it to do.\nSo, you're going to have to define, you know, go to this button, click this, does this work?\nSo, you can define that workflow.\nSo I mentioned before like back in the day like if I'm writing selenium code I have to go click this H1 tag do this like now you can just write in natural language you know click this button click that button so yes it can handle that use case uh specifically of like opening the browser checking these things and but you have to like you know this Nova Act search for coffee maker you know you specifically have to write what buttons to press.\nThank you.\nSee, guess if we have time, I can show some multi- aent collaboration with strands.\nThat could be something cool.\nUh, I think I have a repo for that.\nSo, should be uh go to the AWS labs page.\nWhere's that work?\nand then claude.\nCool.\nOkay,\nI'm just going to copy this code and put it into our environment.\nSo in this example, I'm actually going to show how strand says multi- aent collaboration.\nSo one uh way I'm actually going to create a PowerPoint presentation based on uh you know a cloud migration request.\nI want to like move my u infrastructure on premise to the cloud.\ngive me a presentation of how I would do that.\nAnd so for this, I created three different agents.\nI created a cost analysis agent.\nSo I have a system prompt there, a solutions architect agent to map out what you're going to be doing.\nAnd then each of these uh tools is an actual agent.\nSo this uh costbus has the docs MCP server, the cost analysis MCP server.\nIt has its own prompt.\nThe presentation agent has its own system prompt.\nIt has a tool from there's a a PowerPoint MCP server that I'm using and then there's an architecture agent that also has you know its own specific tools system prompt etc.\nSo uh different agents for different uh things in the workflow and then I have this orchestrator agent what I've called the migration orchestration agent.\nIt has a prompt.\nI tell it what tools it has access to.\nAnd then the cool thing with strands is I make this orchestrator agent and then the tools or this other agents in that.\nSo it knows when to call this agent for this particular tool when to do that and I say you know I want to migrate my work my uh workload.\nSo write the right tools to find that.\nSo I made a fictional company called shop easy e-commerce.\nThey have onremise Java MySQL database.\nI want to zero down from migration like all this all these little constraints in there and I wanted to make a migration plan and a PowerPoint presentation that I can present to my executives of how this would work and I just assigned and I'm the orchestrator agent will find out what to do.\nI don't specifically say do this one first, do that first.\nWe'll let the the agent figure that out.\nSo let me run that strands and it should be multi- aent right so cloud partition agent as tools all right again so all the MCP server is running locally it downloads it's using the UX it start with the architecture design first generates a diagram going to use W.\nSo take some time.\nIt might fail but it would just update update itself.\nMaking another judgment.\nAll right.\nThink it couldn't generate the diagram there, but it's saying all right.\nThat's going to this is what the diagram should have.\nThis is what we're going to doing.\nNow it's going to do a cost analysis cost analysis on based of the things we did there.\nSo it's it's a this workflow takes maybe a couple minutes to run.\nBut you can see it's calling all these agents uh different things.\nIt's understanding what to do, what actions to take first.\nIt's finding pricing for EKS because it has the uh cost analysis tool and knows where to find that information.\nSo it has the up-to-date pricing all the time finding for Aurora for its database.\nSo it's able to understand all that information and get real time up-to-date information just because we have that uh pricing MCP server from the AWS labs example pricing is it oh cost analysis.\nYeah, cost analysis, MCP server documentation, all the stuff you need for finding the right price on AWS.\nIt has all that information and the agent was able to just use that once it's going to generate a report.\nSo, it's still running.\nAgain, this does take a while because I'm asked a very complex question, a lot of things going.\nUh, so it does take a couple minutes to run through all that.\nIt gets it monthly spend predictions, monthly savings, etc.\nSo, it's able to understand all the information and get all up-to-date information based on the plan we've provided.\nAnd the last thing now wants to create an executive presentation.\nSo, download the PowerPoint MCP server and now it's going to make a PowerPoint presentation based on that.\nSo, adding the title slide\n\n\nSo, you know, add a placeholder.\nSo, generating powerpoints is a very popular use case, and there's an MCP server that can go ahead and just do that, add bullet points, etc.\nSo give it a couple another minute or\n",
