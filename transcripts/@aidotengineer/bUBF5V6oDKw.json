  "cleanText": "[Music]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nHello.\nHello.\n[Music]\nOkay, my slides are up.\nYou can see them, right?\nIt's me.\nOkay.\nWell, this is a very special moment for me because I just realized yesterday walking in, this is the exact same spot, the same stage actually, that I stepped on almost exactly day for day 10 years ago to kick off Docker Con 2015.\nThought it was pretty funny.\nI don't know if anyone was there for that.\nMaybe this audience is too young.\nMaybe.\nI don't know.\nOkay.\nWell, uh, I'm here to talk about chaos, specifically the kind of chaos that emerges when you try to use, uh, coding agents.\nUm, and I want to talk about chaos from the perspective of our community at Dagger, which is platform engineers.\nUm, I don't know if there's any platform engineers in the room.\nOkay, just y me, ma'am.\nOkay.\nWell, it it it is known uh uh sometimes uh as other things, but basically platform engineers have a really tough job because they don't get to build and ship cool software.\nThey get to enable all of you to build and ship cool software in the most productive way possible, right?\nUh it's a really tough job.\nIt takes range.\nIt takes experience.\nIt takes a lot of patience.\nBut we do it for the endless gratification.\nYou know, just the gratitude we get from developers.\nJust kidding.\nNo one ever says thank you.\nBut it's okay.\nSomeone has to do it.\nTough job.\nSpeaking of enabling, anyone here use coding agents.\nWe are outnumbered.\nOkay.\nWell, I I want to say to you, congratulations and welcome to platform engineering.\nYeah, I mean your job now is to enable robots to ship awesome software while you spend more and more of your time enabling them to do that productively, right?\nTough job.\nI I I I applaud you for giving up really the most fun and rewarding part of the job.\nYou know, very selfless.\nUh yeah, so of course this is not a completely a reality yet.\nI mean we don't have quite yet the team of agents just kind of you know humming along doing the doing the job while we sit back and um fix environments for them.\nBut you can kind of see it coming, right?\nI mean some of you are definitely doing that, hacking that together.\nThere's a lot of cool posts out there and scripts and tools.\nUm so we know it's coming.\nThe question is how do we enable this to um happen not just for this incredibly cool and uh bleeding edge crowd but for everyone else uh like everyone shipping software any everywhere just sort of creating maximum value by enabling agents to do the work for them ultimately taking their jobs that is the dream right\nokay so yeah how do we do and make it not too painful.\nWell, um I want to go back to basics.\nWhat is an agent?\nUh the famous definition of course is it's an LLM that's wrecking everything in a loop on behalf of a human.\nUm, oh man, that was supposed to be animated.\nIt's even better when it's animated.\nIt's okay.\nYeah, you got one agent and it's doing stuff in the environment is your computer.\nUh, and it can do great work.\nIt can all do also do very crazy things.\nSo, you have to kind of watch it closely, right?\nAnd approve approve.\nNo, no, don't do that.\nThat's crazy.\nYes, that's good.\nUm, that's kind of the status quo today.\nBut of course um we want to scale it, right?\nWe want a team.\nSo how do we do that?\nWell, right now I would say there are two options, both equally wonderful and fun.\nThe first one I call yolo mode, you know, I'll just run 10.\nWhat can happen?\nUh amazingly, this diagram is not the worst case scenario, but yeah, you know, you get the idea.\nSo that the whole methodology of watching it closely just kind of falls apart really quickly because they're all stepping on each other's toes.\nThey're sharing an environment, right?\nOkay.\nEnter option two.\nOh, don't worry about that.\nWe'll run the agents, right?\nWe'll take care of everything.\nWe've got background mode.\nWe've got them.\nWe've got the model.\nWe've got the tools.\nWe got the environment.\nWe've got the compute.\nWe got the secrets.\nWe got everything.\nYou know, just open an issue, wait for the PR, relax until, of course, it doesn't work.\nAnd then you're like, \"No, that's not what I meant.\"\nUm these these actually work really well.\nI think like 10 of those launched just yet just just today and yesterday.\nUm and and they're great.\nIt's just that um you know sometimes you just want to get in there like okay give me the keyboard you know and sometimes you just want to run it on your machine or on your favorite compute provider right use your favorite model you want to mix and match.\nSo there are limitations to this all-in-one model.\nSo the question is is there something better?\nUh is there just a scenario where I just got a team and they're working and you know I can step in or leave them alone and we're just kind of getting stuff done together.\nSo this is how I would summarize it.\nWhat I would want is really four things.\nFirst, I want background work.\nYou know, I don't want to be in there just watching every action.\nThat's obvious.\nUm I want Rails.\nSo that means I want to be able to constrain the agent to to not just do things that I already know are not necessary.\nSo obvious things like context of the project, what's you know what's our coding style, what's our what tools to use, but also here's how to build, here's how to test, here's the base image we we use, right?\nYou can access this secret, you can access that.\nJust an easy way to do that because otherwise I'm going to waste so many tokens just correcting as I go, right?\nThe third is inevitably when I do need to step in I really I want a really efficient and seamless way to do that and it can't be watch every action and it can't be just wait for the PR and do code review you know there's I need a middle ground here and the fourth thing is I want optionality because like I was saying before it's a crazy market you know there's there's awesome models awesome compute awesome infrastructure uh agents are really cool And as cool as they are now, I mean, you one of you is probably like launching one right now and then there's another one tomorrow.\nSo, I don't really want to lock myself into a whole package today and say no in advance to whatever is coming out tomorrow.\nNot in this market.\nSo, to get that um I need an environment that has properties that match this.\nIt needs to be isolated, right?\nSo, background work works.\nIt needs to be customizable so I can set up those rails.\nneeds to be multiplayer so I can you know go all right give me that let me fix this or let me check did you do it you know when the model says I did it did you do it and then you know it should be open no no shade on making money and scaling a huge cloud service that's great you know we have one they're great but I just want choice right I want to be able to choose and get the bo the best commodity I'll just use this It's okay.\nIt's okay to use it.\nThe best commodity component for each uh job and you know could even be open source.\nWho knows?\nWe could collaborate on this.\nAnyway, so unsurprisingly, maybe I'm going to talk about containers now.\nSomeone actually said, you know, you should check that they know Docker.\nThey know containers.\nUh, okay.\nWho knows what containers are?\nWho's used containers?\nOkay, cool.\nCool.\nAll right.\nboost my confidence a little bit.\nBut the point here is we have the technology it's not just about containers, but they do play a crucial role because it's a foundational technology and it is it is underutilized.\nWe don't fully leverage what this technology can do because we're used to the first incarnation of the tools made for humans.\nUh same thing for git.\nI see a lot of hacks involving git work trees.\nAnyone playing with git work trees to to get stuff done?\nOkay, you know what I'm talking about.\nSo this is about that.\nUm and of course we have models that are incredibly smart and getting smarter and they they can exercise these technologies uh really fully.\nWe just need to integrate them in a native way so that we really um tackle the problem at hand which is giving great environments to these agents.\nAnyway, so if we built that native integration, what would it look like?\nWell, we have a take sorry we a dagger.\nI forgot completely to mention my company.\nThat's okay.\nUm, it's great.\nCheck it out.\nUm, we we have a take on that.\nSomething we call container use.\nYou know, there's computer use, browser use.\nU, these agents need container use.\nUm, they need a way to use containers to create environments and work inside of them.\nThis is not the same thing as sandboxing, right?\nThere are a lot of ways to execute the output of the agent in a secure sandbox.\nvery useful, very cool, but that's not the same thing as the agent developing inside of containers entirely, right?\nThat's what we're talking about here.\nSo, I asked my team, hey, we've been developing this thing.\nOh, it's open source, but it's not yet open source.\nLike, it's not finished.\nBut I asked the team, I should show it, right?\nAnd they said, absolutely not.\nIt's not ready.\nSo anyway, you want to demo?\nOkay.\nAll right.\nJust we're clear, this is you agreeing to watch me stumble through a broken demo of unfinished software.\nYes.\nOkay.\nSo much could go wrong right now.\nOkay.\nThis is my terminal.\nCan you see it?\nOkay.\nFor for technical reasons, I'm not going to go to full screen.\nYou just got to stop me when I reach the edge.\nOh, actually I can see it.\nNever mind.\nOkay.\nYeah, old school.\nOkay.\nWe used to do this all the time in the old days.\nOkay.\nSo, uh here's what I'm going to do.\nI'm going to just um try to develop something very simple here.\nI got an empty directory.\nAnd I'm going to try try and make a little homepage for my awesome container use project.\nAnd I'm going to use cloud cloud code.\nGoing to try and use a bunch of them.\nHopefully I made something very clear.\nThis is not a coding agent.\nIt's environments that are portable that you can attach to any coding agent.\nThat's the idea.\nSo you like cloud, use cloud.\nYou like, you know, codecs, use codeex, etc., etc., etc.\nIn an IDE, in the command line, whatever.\nAnd also in the cloud, right?\nin CI.\nLots of cool things you can do once you're async.\nSo, okay, one of the reasons the team said don't do a demo is I'm actually terrible at using cloud.\nSo, uh I have an alias for remembering the flag to disable all, you know, permissions.\nI can never remember it.\nAnd I have a prompt here.\nIt's I'll read it to you in a minute, but it's basically make me a homepage.\nuh make it a go web app so I can know what what's going on because I'm not a cool kid writing TypeScript and run the app when you're done.\nSo while this runs while this maybe runs hopefully.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nCool.\nSo what's happening here is I configured cloud code to use to you know with container use to use containers literally um via MCP.\nSo it was an MCP integration.\nThere are other integrations that we're working on but MCP is the obvious place to start.\nUm, and so now it has, you know, all its usual tools.\nThis is vanilla, uh, cloud code, but now it can create an environment for itself.\nAnd now it's editing files in that environment like in a little sandbox.\nAnd it can also run commands to build it and test it and of course run it in uh, ephemeral containers.\nThis is not one Docker container sitting there.\nEvery time an action needs to be taken, there's an ephemeral container running and then being snapshotted and and uh, returning.\nSo it's just doing its thing.\nUm what what I want to show you here.\nOkay.\nSo here I'm going to first show that nothing has been polluting my workspace.\nIt's happening in a little sandbox.\nAnd the way the sandbox works the state of these files and the containers that are being run is um actually persisted uh in git and it's in a bunch of special git objects that are kind of living alongside the repo.\nSo, it's right there if I need it.\nThis is all local.\nUm, but it's not polluting my workspace by default.\nSo, hopefully it's going to produce something soon.\nUh, while it does that, I'm going to use this little command line.\nIs this readable?\nOkay, little command line.\nCU like go work.\nSee you later.\nBut no, really, it's for container use.\nUm, and I can list environments.\nAnd you can see there's a new environment that's been created here, uh, with a little random name here.\nAnd so there's a few things I can do.\nOne thing I can do is open a terminal.\nAnd here, okay, this part is powered by Dagger, right?\nBut we use Dagger as a sort of a toolbox.\nJust it has all the primitives you need.\nUm, and so here I can see exactly what the agent sees, um, the files, but also the tools.\nSo I can see, okay, what what Go version did you configure for yourself?\nAll right, because the model the the agent is given the ability to figure out what environment it needs and then configure that but in a repeatable containerized way.\nUh so here I can see okay does it build?\nOkay, it builds.\nOkay, so you're done.\nWhat's going on?\nOkay, while we do that, I'm also going to show you actually two more things to say.\nOne, uh a really cool feature of this that I'm not going to show is secrets.\nSo you can just plug in secrets from things like one password.\nI use one password.\nI don't want to use a separate password manager from an AI company.\nNo offense.\nI just want to use my password manager.\nSo I can just plug in and say this environment gets this secret and boom, it can use it, right?\nUm and then the team said, \"Please don't show that.\nThat's just that's going to break for sure.\"\nUm so I won't.\nAnd the other thing I want to say is that because it's all powered by Dagger.\nUm and the point here it's containers and it's open source.\nThat's what you should know.\nUh, it's running on my machine.\n\n\nActually, no, it's not running on my machine because we're at a conference, and there's a lot of things that can go wrong if you run containers and download images.\nSo, instead, I just have it running on my home server in my basement about one mile this way.\nAnd it just kind of works seamlessly.\nIt's streaming files up, streaming files down.\nIt all just kind of works.\nUm, okay.\nThis is the part that I cannot control, as you know.\nUm, okay.\nOne more thing I'll show you.\nYou can watch.\nSo here I can see the history.\nSo behind the scenes, every snapshot of the state is like a git log.\nIt's actually using git under the hood.\nSo if I'm happy with the result, I can go and get it.\nUh, so it's like a happy medium between the it's like a loop, a collaboration loop that's just right.\nIt's not watching every tool and wrecking a shared environment, but it's not waiting for a pull request and, you know, having these long back and forth.\nIt's right in the middle.\nI can see everything going on, and I can say, \"Okay, give me the history of that.\nI want that.\"\nOkay, it says it's live.\nIt's running.\nOo, pretty nice.\nCool.\nOkay, so now\nOkay, I appreciate it, but you guys can be honest.\nIt's a little boring.\nSo, this design is boring.\nMake it really pop.\nTrying to impress a engineering there.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nSo, the reason I'm doing that is trying to create the circumstances where I would need a lot of parallel experiments, right?\nMake it pop.\nWhat does that mean?\nIt mean anything.\nWhat if I want to try several experiments in parallel, right?\nSo, I'm just going to say, oh, well, hold on one second.\nStop.\nBefore I do that, I'm going to um merge this.\nRight?\nThere's still nothing here, but I'm saying I like it.\nSo, I'm going to say merge that environment.\nAnd I have it.\nIt's my history.\nI can open a pull request, can clean it up, whatever.\nSo that's that's a loop that I can work with, right?\nUm and now I can say nah, boring.\nAnd then I can say since the environment is now in this state, I can ask for help from a few other agents, right?\nI can say okay, hey Claude Yolo, uh that's not right.\nClaude Yolo, this web app looks a bit boring.\nCan you make it pop please?\nOkay.\nAnd go and go and go.\nOkay.\nSo, this is where things start really going wrong.\nBut as the team pointed out, they said they said, \"Well, something's going to go wrong, right?\"\nThey said, \"Yeah, but you were kind of showing that if things go wrong, you can throw away the environment and you're good.\nYou can restart.\"\nI say, \"Okay, that's cool.\"\nSo, um, like let's say I don't like this one.\nI'm like, \"Nope.\nGoodbye.\nThat's it.\nI don't have to go clean up the mess, right?\nThat's the whole point.\"\nUh, okay.\nSo, this is getting a little messy.\nOh, I wanted to show Goose also.\nSo, Goose is a really cool open source agent.\nWhoops.\nAll right.\nHold on a second.\nGoose YOLO.\nSame thing.\nEveryone has complicated flags for disabling all these safeties that I don't need anymore, right?\nBecause it's Uh, okay.\nOkay.\nWell, really taking a chance here.\nSo, while this is happening, uh, one thing we've been working on, but I it's still work in progress is there's a watch command.\nI showed you that already, but as so as, um, this is a git command, right?\nThinly wrapped git command.\nOur UX is really I cannot words cannot express how unfinished this is but but it's it'll evolve rapidly because the bones are strong.\nIt's git, it's Dagger, and you know it's your existing agent, right?\nSo it's and then a little bit of glue.\nUh so for example here is literally it's a git command they can copy paste.\nUh, but as the agents work, you're going to see states snapshotting and you're going to see these branches just kind of um diverging and then I can diff them and apply them, merge them, whatever I want.\nUm, and what I really wanted to show and then I'm done is just I just want to see one of them run.\nSo you can see when the agent runs a service like and go in this case go run npm run whatever it's doing it in its containerized environment and that's going to seamlessly be tunnneled to my machine here on a different port without any conflicts right so if when when I say the environment's isolated it's it's the files its context its configuration and its execution right uh and the cool the cool extra thing is all of this is actually technically This here is running in my basement.\nSo you can go crazy on the infrastructure side.\nLike you can run this on a cluster.\nWe like to run this stuff from CI.\nUh it's just a lot of fun stuff you can do.\nAnd I'm getting at 30 seconds.\nOh, Goose is Oh, Goose is running.\nGreat.\nOkay.\nWe did not solve prompt engineering.\nDo it.\nOkay.\nNot done.\nNot done.\nOh man.\nOkay.\nWell, just imagine.\n[Laughter]\nOkay.\nWell, uh, while this happens, because I got 30 seconds left, I'm just going to say, um, thank you.\nAnd there's one last thing I I want to say about Docker Con.\n10 years ago, we used to open source stuff on stage all the time.\nSo, if you want, I can go and open source it right now.\nOkay.\nYou have been warned though about the not finished part, right?\nOkay.\nOkay.\nOh, I think my It would be funny if the demo failed at the clicking on GitHub part.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nGoodbye.\nGoodbye.\nNext time.\nI promise it works.\nOkay.\nHaven't done this in a while.\nWait.\nOh, I'm almost done.\nThe promise.\nCome on.\nYou did so well.\nChange visibility.\nYes.\nI want Yes, I have read and understand.\nOh, God.\nOh, God.\nUh yes.\nAt Dagger, we take security very seriously.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nI think it's Wait.\nI think it's done.\nYes.\nOkay.\nSo, yeah, thank you very much.\nAnd it's uh github.com/dagger/container use.\nCome say hi, come participate.\nAnd thank you so much for having me.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n",
