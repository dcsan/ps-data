  "cleanText": "[Music]\nSince all the questions already got asked, who built an MCP server and it didn't work?\nOkay, Sam, go.\nSo, we're here to commiserate on how to actually build with the Full Spec MCP.\nWhat are the hidden capabilities, why they matter, and how they light up?\nI work on VS Code, so this is a biased local MCP for development track, but all of it is applicable to everything.\nI really love the intro to the track.\nIt's all about MCP on high velocity.\nThere is a lot of ecosystem growth, excitement, people working together, collaborating, but there's so much more work to do as they realize it's so early in that ecosystem.\nSo none of this is a criticism of the spec or the ecosystem.\nIt's just we're so early, and I want to point out where we can gain more powers.\nAnd just 10 days ago on a Friday, we had actually this first in real life gathering of the MCP steering committee during the MCP Dev Summit.\nSo that's how early it is.\nWe haven't even met before.\nWe just talk on discords.\nWe finally met in person the first time to talk about anything, how to evolve the spec, how to evolve the ecosystem, and all the basics are kind of covered.\nUm, hopefully in the previous talks, this is my first MCP talk that I don't spend halfway through just explaining what MCP is.\nThere's roots in the client.\nThere's sampling.\nThere's prompts and tools and resources.\nThere's a really rich ecosystem to build dynamic discovery and persistent resources and rich interactions, but there's a gap in how this is being implemented.\nThere's this like MCP is just another API wrapper syndrome that's happening because people just want to ship.\nThey want to build products, and they're actually building really excellent products with just tools.\nAnd that creates this reinforcing loop because once you see how MCP works, you're just going to use the same stacks and repeat the same tools only ecosystem.\nAnd there's technical barriers.\nPeople do this because there's missing support in the clients and SDKs and documentation and the references.\nAnd the clients reflect this most.\nIf you look at the adoption that's from the website of Model Context Protocol, you see everybody goes for tools because that's where the most immediate success is.\nAnd if you're honest, actually most of the resources and prompts, you can do similar flows just with tools.\nAnd VS Code does the same thing.\nWe, when we launched two months ago now with our MCP support, we started with tools, and we already added discovery and roots because we're working towards actually reading this the spec and implementing it, and I'm happy to announce that with VS Code's upcoming release v 1.10.0.\nTotally got it wrong, but it's already in insiders now.\nSo download it.\nWe actually have the full spec support, and that's what I want to talk about here about all the other things that people are not using yet.\nYes, that's clapping.\nOkay, so the message is if you go with full MCP spec support, you will can unlock these rich stateful interactions that MCP vision is really outlining on how agents should work together.\nStarting with the most obvious tools, so not going too deep here, but tools reflect actions, well-defined performing actions and mostly easy mapping to function calling if you're used to that.\nAnd on the right side, you see Playwright.\nYou can start a server, it will open the browser and take a screenshot.\nBut tools are often leading to quality problems, and we all struggle with that.\nRaise your hand if you had some error in your IDE that you couldn't add more tools and you couldn't run it or run wrong tools because you have too many.\nAnd there's research from LangChain that nicely underlines that and pointing out the three vectors of it's too many tools.\nSo AI gets confused by that.\nIt's too many domains of tools.\nSo if you suddenly have some different properties for each tool and instructions coming with each tool, then it also gets confused versus just a pure like this is UI testing.\nAnd lastly, it's just a repetition.\nThe more repetitions the AI has to do to actually run tools to solve a problem, the easier it is to get confused as well.\nSo it's really quality over quantity, and clients handle that somewhat.\nThey give you extra controls like in VS Code, we added actually per chat tool selection.\nSo there's a little tool packer, and you can actually reduce down the tools of what you actually need in the moment versus all the tools.\nIt has nice keyword accessibility.\nIt's really quick to set up and will persist for the session.\nSo that's one way we have actually mentioning of tools.\nSo like sometimes you're like pull this issue and trying to like verb out whatever tool you're trying to invoke, like why not just use this tool and please make up all the right parameters to use it properly and then use the other tool.\nSo that's what we allow as well.\nAnd then lastly just in this insiders actually, we're shipping user-defined tool sets, and that's more of a reusable concept.\nOnce you get into the mode like these are all the tools I need for a front-end testing flow, then you just put those into a tool set and said use my front-end testing flow.\nSo that's coming as well.\nSo these are all user controls, but actually that spec has dynamic discovery built in.\nAnd that means on the fly a server can say but actually that spec hack are going to give you these other tools.\nAnd on the right you see GitHub mudmc.\nIt's on GitHub.\nYou can check it out.\nAnd this starts with a chat mode that I created that puts the agent into a game master prompt and it has the MUD MCP installed.\nSo now with the mode active, I can go into the agent, switch to MUD and play the game.\nAnd what dynamic tool discovery does here, it actually makes it aware of which room I am in.\nSo dungeon crawler, you walk from room to room, like you can go east and north, you can pick up stuff and if there's a monster, I can battle the monster.\nBut the tool for battling shouldn't be there when there's no monster.\nEventually, I advance through the game and I finally find a goblin I can battle.\nWhere of tools for battling shouldn't be there when there's no monster.\nEventually, I advance through the game and I finally find a goblin I can battle and the battle tool appears.\nI can battle the goblin.\nSo, imagine those MCP you want to work on.\nThose are coming up to give servers and clients a little bit more really tools and actions actually the add context return a giant file from your server but you want to return a reference to the file and that could be something the LLM could follow up on or the user can actually act upon.\nThen the other use case is actually giving files to the user.\nSo if you take a screenshot via Playwright, it want to expose it to both the LLM and the user and resources provide that semantic layer and you in what are the issues?\nOh, I found your issue that's they want to understand the Python environment and maybe look at your settings of how you set it up so they can customize and that makes it more dynamic and stateful out of the box.\nThe other one is like if you can look at actual the packages and your libraries installed, it's a great way to customize it to a React setup versus a Svelte setup and really acknowledging what the user is looking at and not asking constantly like what framework are you working on.\nLike just you work in my folder, so just look at it.\nAnd lastly, I think the idea of like what what is that CI/CD pipeline?\nThat's where MCP servers really shine to connect the end to end of a developer experience.\nAnd you can also read those out.\nSampling.\nWho has heard about sampling?\nIs really excited about sampling.\nOkay, so you understand what I mean.\nSo sampling.\nSampling is one of the oddly named primitives as well.\nAnd if it had a better name, maybe more people would use it.\nUh, but it's actually now implemented insiders and it's so much fun to use.\nSo it allows the server to request LLM completions from the client.\nAnd what I'm showing here on the right is the permission dialogue that pops up to allow the server to access the LLM.\nRight now it's wired up by default to GPD4.1.\nThere's more spec improvements to make it with structured formatting.\nThere's some ideas out there.\nSo there's a lot of things to make it better, but right now nobody has implemented it.\nSo there wasn't really need to make it better, but implementation is now here.\nSo please use sampling.\nThat's a nice progressive enhancement.\nMaybe by default you return the kitchen sink.\nAnd once you have sampling, you can do interesting things like summarizing resources in into more tangible things.\nYou can format a website that you fetch into markdown for the LLM or you can even think about agentic server tools that one run via the LLM from the client.\nWe look beyond the primitives.\nThere's a few things that are also interesting.\nSo far we have roots and tools and resources and prompts and they with dynamic discovery you can update them at any time.\nThe client will send new roots as the VS Code workspace changes.\nYou can send new roots new servers and new pool tools and prompts from the server as you update and you change.\nSo it's really dynamic environment already.\nBut there's more pain points to make these servers really powerful.\nOne is the developer experience.\nWho's been struggling with working on MCP servers and debugging and logging and everything?\nYeah, want to see hands up.\nYeah, guess apparently it's really easy.\nSo maybe it's not a problem.\nOkay, so we have it now dev mode in VS Code which is a little dev toggle and you already see the console that always works for all MCPU servers.\nSo once you hit a snack that just works and then now now it's in debugging mode.\nSo actually has the debugger attached.\nSo once I run the prompt which is dynamically generate on a server, I can now hit the break point and step through it.\nAnd that's really hard usually because your server is not owned usually by any process that you run manually.\nIt's owned by whatever client and host is running the MCP server.\nSo because VS Code is both, it can just put it into debug mode and attach its debugger and that works for Python and Note right now out of the box.\nSo, super exciting and it's yeah, it has changed how I work on MCPs.\nDefinitely\nthe latest spec was already called out.\nI just want to call it out again because it's so important that people stay on the tip of the spec on what's coming and understand what's in draft.\nThose things that are in draft only become stable because people provide feedback that it's useful and that it's working.\nAnd if they're in draft and nobody provides feedback, then they will still go into stable and they might need revisions like the offspec.\nSo the updated offspec on the right gives this enterprise grade authorization.\nThere's a talk tomorrow about building protected MCP server that I can highly recommend from then who actually worked on the offspec.\nSo if you want to talk to one of the people behind it and want to dive really deep into O you can do that.\nThen streamable HTTP has been working in VS Code since two versions as well.\nBut then it's been really hard to test because there's no servers out there.\nSo if you work on hosting, you're really excited about streamable HTTP.\nYou should really get everybody that is hosting your MSP servers to to get onto it and not use SSE anymore.\nSSE is still possible to use with HTTP.\nSo you get both benefits, but you're avoiding this really stateful churn on your servers.\nLast one already mentioned there's a community registry happening and that's think the other big pain point like if I build a server and nobody finds it or what is the discovery experience like how do I send people like do I send JSON blobs around for people to discover my server.\nThere's a lot of community work around this to make this discovery easy.\nSo it's a big shout out to everybody on the steering committee the community working groups and everybody involved here.\nUm, if you want to check it out, it's on model contracts protocolregistry on GitHub and it's all happening out in the open.\nAnd lastly, I'm really excited about elicitations.\nUm, that's actually coming in the next draft.\nUm, spec reference, spec draft, release, whatever.\nAnd this is a way for tools to finally reach out back to the user when they need more information.\nRight now, tools are all controlled by the LLM and you get all the information from them.\nBut then when it actually needs more concrete specific input from the user then you you can throw them into another chat experience and ask for it but why not just give them an input to provide it directly.\nSo it's it's again more statefulness in the tools on top.\nSo your help is needed.\nUm progressive enhancement in MCP is possible.\nI think we want to have more best practices out there maybe even in the references servers to show it off.\nBut everything is now ready to be used.\nThere's clients supporting the latest spec that you can run it in and test it in.\nThose clients are used by users.\nAnd as more users showcase how great these stateful servers can be and outline these best practices, this interoperability gap will close and clients will catch up.\nIt's a very fastmoving ecosystem.\nPeople are complaining like, oh, you ship this two weeks after the other person.\nUm but it's all coming together and as as people use these and learn and bring feedback it becomes better.\nSo make actionoriented context aware semanticaw aware service using the full spec.\nAnd then lastly contribute to the ecosystem.\nIf you have the time read up on some of the open RFC's I shared like namespaces and search to kind of see what's coming.\nMake sure they get into the SDKs you're using by following the issues and just share back on your experience.\nI think a lot of people mis misunderstand how much influence they have on clients and SDKs and everything by filing issues by providing feedback.\nI'm helping to triage a lot of the MCP issues coming into VS Code.\nWe read all of them.\nWe learn from them and really that drives our road map and that happens probably with every other clip team out there.\nSo really make your voice heard of like you everybody should support sampling.\nSo so there's a transformative potential in MCP that we all can unlock with the spec that is already there so the ecosystem catches up to the spec.\nSo with that let's go um and feel free to hit us up on the Microsoft booth.\nThere's two VS Code people there Tyler and Rob.\nYou can also talk to or talk to me or talk to your friendly MCP steering committee members.\nThank you.\n",
