  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHello.\nThis is awesome.\nThis is a big crowd.\nWho here has used Claude Code before?\nJesus.\nAwesome.\nThat's what I like to see.\nCool.\nSo, my name is Boris.\nI'm a member of technical staff at Anthropic and creator of Claude Code.\nAnd um, I was struggling with what to talk about for an audience that already knows Claude Code, already knows AI and all the coding tools and agentic coding and stuff like that.\nSo, I'm going to zoom out a little bit and then we'll zoom back in.\nSo here's my TLDDR.\nThe model is moving really fast.\nIt's on exponential.\nIt's getting better at coding very, very quickly, as everyone that uses the model knows.\nAnd the product is kind of struggling to keep up.\nWe're trying to figure out what product to build that's good enough for a model like this.\nAnd we feel like there's so many more products that could be built for models that are this good at coding.\nAnd we're kind of building the bare minimum.\nAnd I'll kind of talk about why.\nAnd with Claude Code, we're trying to stay unopinionated about what the product should look like because we don't know.\nSo for everyone that didn't raise your hand, I think that's like 10 of you.\nUh, this is how you get Claude Code.\nUm, you can head to quadi/code to install it.\nUh, you can run this incantation to install from npm.\nUm, as of yesterday, we support quad pro plan.\nSo you can try it on that.\nUh, we support cloud max.\nSo yeah, just try it out.\nTell us what you think.\nSo programming is changing and it's changing faster and faster.\nAnd if you look at where programming started back in, you know, the 1930s4s, there there was like switchboards and it was this physical thing.\nThere was no such thing as software.\nAnd then sometime in the 1950s, punch cards became a thing.\nAnd my uh my my grandpa actually in the Soviet Union, he was one of the first programmers in the in the Soviet Union.\nAnd my mom would tell me stories about like, you know, when she grew up in the 1970s or whatever, he would bring these big stacks of punch cards home.\nAnd she would like from work and and she would like draw over them with crayons.\nAnd that was growing out for her.\nAnd that that's what programming was back back in the 1950s, 60s, 70s even.\nBut sometime in the late 50s, we started to see these higher level languages emerge.\nSo first there was assembly.\nSo programming moves from hardware to punch cards which is still physical to to software.\nAnd then the level of abstraction just went up.\nSo we got to cobalt.\nThen we got to typed languages.\nWe got to C++.\nIn the early 90s there was this explosion of these new language families.\nThere was you know the Haskell family and um you know JavaScript and Java, the evolution of the C family and then Python.\nAnd I think nowadays if you kind of squint all the languages sort of look the same.\nLike when I write TypeScript, it kind of feels like writing Rust and that kind of feels like writing Swift and that kind of feels like writing Go.\nThe abstractions have started to converge a bit.\nIf we think about the UX of programming languages, this has also evolved.\nBack in the 1950s, you use something like a typewriter to punch holes in punch cards, and that was programming back in the day.\nAnd at some point, text editors appeared.\nUm and then uh Pascal and all these different ids uh appeared that let you interact with your programs and your software in new ways and each one kind of brought something and I I feel like programming languages have sort of leveled out but the model is on an exponential and the UX of programming is also on an exponential and I'll talk a little bit more about that.\nDoes anyone know what was the first text editor?\nOkay, I heard I heard Ed from someone.\nI think you read the screen before.\nWell, before text editors, this is what programming looked like.\nSo, this was the IPMO29.\nThis was kind of a top-of-the-line.\nThis was like the MacBook of the time for programming punch cards.\nEveryone had this.\nYou can still find it in museums somewhere.\nAnd yeah, this is Ed.\nThis is the the first text editor.\nThis was uh Chem Thompson at at the labs invented this.\nAnd you know, it kind of looks familiar.\nIf you open your MacBook, you can actually still type Ed.\nThis is still is still distributed on Unix uh as as part of Unix systems.\nAnd this is crazy because this thing was invented like 50 years ago.\nAnd this is nuts.\nLike there there's no cursor, there's no scroll back uh there's no fancy commands, there's no type ahead.\nThere's pretty much nothing.\nThis is the simple text editor of the time.\nAnd it was built for teletype machines which were literally physical machines that printed paper on paper.\nThat's how your program was printed.\nAnd this is the first software manifestation of a UX for programming software.\nSo, it was really built for these machines that didn't support scrollback and cursors or anything like that.\nUm, for all the Vim fans, I'm going to jump at jump ahead of Vim.\nVim was a big innovation.\nEmacs was a big innovation around the same time.\nI think in 1980, Small Talk 80 was a big uh it was a big jump forward.\nThis is one of the first I think the first graphical interface for programming software.\nAnd um for anyone that's tried to set up like live reload with React or Redux or any of this stuff, this thing had live reload in 1980 and it worked and we're still kind of struggling to get that to work with like ReactJS nowadays.\nSo this this was a big jump forward and obviously like the language it had object-oriented programming and a bunch of new concepts but on the UI side there's a lot of new things too.\nIn '91, I think Visual Basic was the first code editor that introduced a graphical paradigm to the mainstream.\nSo before people were using textbased editors, Vim and things like that were still very popular despite things like small talk.\nUm, but this kind of brought it mainstream.\nThis is what I grew up with.\nEclipse brought type ahead to the mainstream.\nThis isn't using AI type ahead.\nThis is not cursor when surf.\nThis is just using static analysis.\nSo it's indexing your symbols and then it can rank the symbols and rerank them and it knows what symbols to show.\nI think this was also the first big third party ecosystem for ids.\nCopilot was a big jump forward with single line type ahead and then multi-line type ahead.\nAnd I think Devon was probably the first IDE that introduced this next concept and this next abstraction to the world which is to program you don't have to write code you can write natural language and that becomes code.\nAnd this is something people have been trying to figure out for decades.\nI think Devon is the first product that broke through and and took this mainstream\nand the UX has evolved quickly but I think it's about to get even faster.\nWe talked about uh UX and we talked about programming languages and verification is a part of this too.\nUm so verification has started with manual debugging and like physically inspecting outputs.\nUm, and now there's a lot of probabilistic verification, uh, like fuzzing and vulnerability testing and, uh, like Netflix's chaos, uh, testing and things like that.\nAnd so with all this in mind, Claude Code's approach is a little different.\nIt's to start with a terminal and to give you as lowle access to the model as possible in a way that you can still be productive.\nSo we want the model to be useful for you.\nWe also want to get we want to be unopinionated and we want to get out of the way.\nSo we don't give you a bunch of flashy UI.\nWe don't try to put a bunch of scaffolding in the way.\nSome of this is we're a model company at Anthropic and you know we make models and we want people to experience those models.\nBut I think another part is we actually just don't know like we don't know what the right UX is.\nSo we're starting simple.\nAnd so Claude Code it's intentionally simple.\nIt's intentionally general.\nUm, it shows off the model in the ways that matter to us, which is they can use all your tools and they can fit into all your workloads.\nSo you can figure out how to use the model in this world where the UX of using code and using models is changing so fast.\nAnd so this is my second point.\nThe model just keeps getting better.\nAnd this is the better lesson.\nI have it uh I have I have this like framed and taped to the side of my wall\nbecause the more general model always wins and the model increases in capability exponentially and there are many coral areas to this.\nEverything around the model is also increasing exponentially and the more general thing even around the model usually wins.\n[Music]\n",
