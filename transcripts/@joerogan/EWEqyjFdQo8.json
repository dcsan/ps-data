Thank you, Marjaro. Shout out Marjaro. You're looking good, dude. Big ups, Marjaro. It's nice to see, you know. Thank you. I am exercising, too. Beautiful. You have to or it will just be floppy and weird and gross. Or it'll eat your bones, I guess. Also, yes, it'll eat your bones, they say.\n\nI'm real big on taking this stuff and then not really following up with like, you know what I mean? I just started doing testosterone from a company that's like, you know, it's above board taking it, but like they're like, \"You should make sure you monitor your blood all the time.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, we'll get to that at some point.\" I'm going to keep taking it though. You don't monitor your blood at all?\n\nNo, not me with any regularity. I think you should probably do that. Yeah, they did it there. I know someone I know says they take testosterone and they have to like donate blood every month to get blood. I've heard that before so thick. I talked to my doctor about it because that really doesn't make sense. But he has heard of occasions where people had to do that to unthicken their blood. Too much blood or something. They're like, \"How much are you taking? Like what are you doing? You going ham, bro?\" This man's health company saw me coming down the road a mile away. They offer me. I'm taking two peptides and I don't even know. We started. Sorry. We couldn't wait. Why even ask me? I I don't know. Why? Why you were on the door? I was like, this doesn't make sense. Let's just start. I'm taking two peptides. They feel like fire. It feels like fire when I inject them. But really, what are they? I don't Well, the BPC57. That's the one everyone's doing, right? That's a good one. And then something that's blue. It's blue. Oh, methylene blue. I don't know. It burns. Wait a minute. Hold up. Methylene blue. You're not supposed to inject. It's not that then. It's G. It starts with a G. It's some other letters. GH. Methylene blue is weird stuff. It's uh it's a dye for like fabrics that people take for its health benefits. Like it what the [ __ ] Boost mitochondria or something. Yeah, it's really weird. Like what exactly does it do? I should ask. Even though I take it, I'm like I don't take it all the time, but I have taken it and I don't know. I couldn't I couldn't describe. I couldn't explain exactly. Here it is. a medication used uh in the management and treatment of what's that word?\nMethyl methoglobanemia.\nMeth methoglobanemia.\nA condition where hemoglobin decreases its ability to carry oxygen. Huh? Straight up. But it started out as a fabric dye. I'm pretty sure, right? Doesn't it say that? What is it two for humans? I think it was a dye. Yeah, which is so weird that a dye would have health benefits. I grew up in a house of supplements. My stepfather was a powerlifter, so I only know about creatine. Thick. Uh, that's it. Creatine. Creatinine was another one that would show up in the house sometimes. Creatinine. Really? Yeah. What's that? I don't know. But I think Jasonine twice and he's just remembering it wrong. No, it was another word. Super creatine.\n\nCreatine's legit. That stuff's super good for you. Yeah. I just started taking Tongad Ali for my uh testosterone. Creatinine is a waste product that forms from the breakdown of creatine in muscles. Huh? Why would I take it? There's another uh natural one. What? I think it's called turquesterone. I know chilleit is good for testosterone.\n\nI my doctor I asked my doctor to put me on testosterone. I think we talked about it cuz you're like, \"Dude, I got Don't worry. [ __ ] your doctor. I got a doctor for you.\" And I was just like, \"Yeah, maybe I I'll just stop smoking weed.\" You think that was killing your testosterone? I think so. It was It was like lower than it should have been. It was like in the high 30s and now it's at like mid fives. Well, like a good doctor, what they'll do first is ask you like, \"What do you do for exercise? What are you eating? How much do you sleep?\" Like those things are all the first thing the doctor will ask you. And if all that stuff's [ __ ] up, they shouldn't just give you testosterone. They should be like, \"Let's My place did shout out game day men's health. 15 minutes. They'll give me anything I want in a needle.\" There's a few doctors out there that like to go buck wild. Of course, I think they get incentivized. I got PRP treatment in my hair. I'm not losing my hair. They just talked me into it. Now it's never going away. PRP worked. I don't know. We're going to find out. I just got it like two weeks ago. Jay is a His hair's thinning. He's It It's definitely going. There's a bunch of topical stuff that you could use these days. Sure. There's like a finasteride topical, but I would worry that that would get into your skin and into your bloodstream. Like that finasteride stuff is crazy. Like that makes some people very depressed. It kills your DHT, which is what keeps your hair from falling out. And for some people, they just it kills their testosterone. They get like super depressed. Yeah. I started losing my hair when I was 18. And I just said, \"Fuck it. I was bald.\" What's that? I love not having to talk to a barber. That's the best. You shave it, which is a big razor. [ __ ] beautiful. How do you find out how much that your barber doesn't know you, but is a big fan of Ralph Barbosa? You guys aren't going to find out if you get from your barber. I don't know you, but you know, dog.\n\nOh, Kenny. His name's Kenny. He's a nice enough guy. Ralph Barbos is slick. He's like a slick comic. Like his punchlines are like smooth, you know. It's great. Very funny, man. Yeah. He's got a great fully loaded with him. He's like he makes he's got a fun like just his approach. I like it. It's very slick. Yeah. You know, and he's sending the elevator down. I mean, he's going taking guys on tour that I've never heard of, but I think been around for a long time. Cool move. That's great. Yeah. Very good dude. He hung out with us at the mothership one night. Fun guy. Yeah. He got popular for uh he like someone said on like George Lopez's show or something they were like this guy sucks or no George Lopez was like I don't get it he's just whatever and then I think someone was talking well about him and then George Lopez was very dismissive of him and I think that's what happened and someone asked Ralph B on some on something and his response I think is what made it like very popular. I think he was just saying because he goes he doesn't like me because one of his one of his comments goes like oh delay and I think that just you know you show any picture of George Lopez bugging his eyes out and make that hilarious. That's hilarious.\n\nIt's good [ __ ] good fireback. Yeah. Are you good at living in comedy beefs? I'm so terrible at it. No, I don't like comedy beefs. [ __ ] hate it. I don't like any beefs. Luis, you've been in a few where you've gone to bed on I mean, I guess I have those same beefs, too, but I don't engage as much with No, I'm a loser. I just I get on a flight and I'll be on Twitter for [ __ ] hours just tweeting at people for no reason at all. No, but I mean like particular like a a person you could put a face to like a comic like not that I haven't had a problem with somebody before. Um, but I mean like I don't know. I have a hard time like sleeping on like I'm going to run this person every night and we hate each other. It's been a while. I mean I I'm not It's just not that serious. There's nobody in the world that I hate. Like there's literally no even people that hate me. I'm like, \"Yeah, dude. We're cool.\" The guy that murdered your father, dude. I tried to get him on my podcast. True. Oh my god. So, the guy My father was stabbed to death when I was four years old. And then years later, after the guy got out of prison, I was like, \"Let me try to get this guy on my podcast and interview him.\" How interesting would that be? Oh my god. Um, but he was already dead. Yeah, dude. That would have been insane. Yeah, cuz I didn't I wasn't like cuz I was a kid. Why? Imagine there being like a [ __ ] 75year-old man like showing up at this young guy's house who you stabbed his dad. You're going to be alone together. That guy's going to kill you. Yeah, maybe. That's what I would think. If I was an old man, I couldn't defend myself. I don't think it was that old. He was 17 when he killed my father. Oh, wow. So, he was only 13 years older than me. So, he'd be like 60 now, I guess. Yeah. But this is like a decade ago that I was going to do that. Guy's a convicted murderer, dude. He could [ __ ] your [ __ ] up. Yeah. when he was a kid and my father beat him up. My father was a bully. What if Conor McGregor? He goes, \"Well, Lewis, I'd like to say I apologize to absolutely [ __ ] nobody at all.\"\n\nYeah. Um, but I thought that would have been an interesting conversation and I wasn't like going into it being like, \"Oh, you've killed my father. I'm angry.\" I got a great life. My father lived, I would be [ __ ] I'd probably live in Patterson, New Jersey still. I'd have a [ __ ] life. My father was a [ __ ] We always tell ourselves a drug dealer and a pimp. If he if he was alive. Yeah, it worked out well. Yeah, but that's always I say, \"Hey, if my dad stuck around, maybe I wouldn't have the personality to have and I wouldn't be where I'm at.\" So, maybe it would be way better. No. Well, I wouldn't have my Maybe I'd be a head of state or something. Like, if I that one sperm had hit that one egg, I wouldn't have my son right now if my father was alive. If anything happened differently. Yeah. All right, Ashton Coocher. That's butterfly effect over here. Guy watches one movie, all of a sudden figured out. Do you guys ever think maybe we're just plugged into a pod somewhere and this is all nothing? I'm going to see if I can fly real quick. I think there's something to that we're plugged into something. It seems more like it every day. It seems like this is like an advanced stage of the video game right now where like they're lighting cop cars on fire in LA and throwing bricks off of overpasses. Dude, it does seem fun to order a Whimo and light it on fire. Nobody gets hurt. It's just hilarious. And I think it's directionally correct.\n\nLike you should probably start killing robots. Like you guys are you on the right course. They're early on the war machine. They're trying to stop the Terminator. Bro, these are all going to be owned by corporations and it's going to be the only way you're allowed to get around cuz they're the safest. They're going to take away everybody's driver's license. It's going to get weird as [ __ ] Oh yeah. But it's going to probably The cars are going to go 200 miles an hour. Probably traffic will be eliminated. Dude, I think they're going to be more of these [ __ ] things that we just saw in LA. That's what I think. I've heard that uh teenagers are going back to smoking regular cigarettes now and getting away from vapes. We might move back analog a little bit. You know what I mean? Bring back manual cars. I wonder if analog makes some sort where it slows down because people want it to slow down a little bit.\n\nYeah, but it's too late. They they do want it to slow down. Yeah. I mean, the electric car didn't really take off the way they'd hoped. Yeah. The problem with electric cars is the charging time's too much. It's too much. If you're a young single woman and you have to charge your car and you have to just sit there for a [ __ ] hour. I I also feel that way. So I feel like you should just call me a young single woman. Well, you're you're a man. Any human any human's vulnerable, but like a woman by herself is particularly vulnerable, right? Like if you're a hot girl and you're sitting in your car, how many [ __ ] creeps that know that you have to be there for an hour? How many creeps can bother you? That's a great idea, Joe. There you go. Let's find a hot start getting girls at the [ __ ] charging stations.\n\nTesla, get a large order and just walk down the aisle of Teslas waiting to find a hot one. Looking Yeah, dude. Have you ever Tesla doc [ __ ] Have Have you ever driven one? Nah, dude. From the 70s. I don't trust that electric [ __ ] I tried I was going to rent one once and I they give you the keys and I was like I was like, this is going to be fun. And then I remembered you have to charge it. I was like, I got to\n\n\nDrive to [ __ ] Rhode Island right now.\nI was like, \"I'm going to have to stop halfway there and charge the car.\"\nI think, I think you can get, I think you can get there.\nIt's just then you have to charge it.\nNo, I don't think we wouldn't have made it.\nNo, it's like the real mileage is different than the mileage it says.\nSo, it really should say like percentage of battery, but they want you to like estimate the mileage, but it's all dependent upon how fast you're going.\nLike, if you're accelerating a lot, if you're moving around, if you stop and go traffic, like who knows what the real mileage is.\nIf you're on like, say, if you get stuck in a crazy traffic jam for like four hours, like there's some explosion somewhere, like and you you supposedly have 200 miles on your car.\nIs that good for four hours of you sitting there too with the radio on with the air conditioning on?\nLike when is we're team Trump then?\nNot Elon.\n[ __ ] Elon M.\nIf it's cold, if it's cold, they die quick.\nThey die quicker.\nYeah, that happened in Chicago.\nRemember when they had that [ __ ] big thing where the highway got closed down and people in Teslas were [ __ ] man, cuz they just stopped working.\nAlso, if you blow a tire, like Tesla has to come fix that.\nReally?\nYeah.\nWhy is that?\nI don't know.\nBut it's like they have to come handle it.\nFunction of Teslas though is amazing, dude.\nThey're amazing.\nThey [ __ ] drive themselves.\nYou press the you like where I go.\nYou trust that 100%.\nAnd I go and it just takes you wherever you want to go.\nIt changes lanes, bro.\nIt's nuts.\nYou could be, you could put on like dark sunglasses at night and just like have your hands on the wheel.\nIt's that good.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\nDon't do, I don't do it.\nI don't do it, but I have done it where, but I keep my hand near the wheel just to see what it can do.\nIt does everything.\nYeah.\nNo, that's much better.\nI do, I get like road paralysis where like if I'm like driving for more than an hour and I'm looking at the lines, not paralysis, um hypn, what do they call it?\nLike road hypnosis.\nSo I'll get hypnotized by the lines and I start falling, I start falling asleep if I have to drive for more than an hour or two at night.\nYou know how to fix that?\nDo you know how to fix that?\nIt's really easy.\nUh, cocaine.\nNo, no, no.\nUm, no, that's not cocaine for that.\nThat'll work, too.\nYou're right.\nBut you have to keep doing it over and over again.\nUm, get some ice and um, just a washcloth.\nA washcloth with wet washcloth with ice in it and just rub your face.\nRub your face.\nYou wake right up.\nYou wake right up and it lasts for like ice wash you keep in your car.\nGreat.\nLove that.\nThe uh, the smelling salts you have in the club.\nOh, those will do it.\nThose will do it.\nI do, I did a terrible prank.\nIt might [ __ ] you up.\nYou're like, you might change lanes.\nYou maybe shouldn't tell this.\nIt might be illegal what you've done.\nNo, it's not illegal.\nThat's definitely, this is a, I will say it's a bad prank to do on a girl.\nIf this was a dude to do to, this is a crazy dangerous prank.\nIf this was a dude, everyone would have been like, \"Dude, great prank.\"\nBut because I did it to a girl, it was a little bit [ __ ] up.\nSo, we were at the mothership last time we were doing our podcast and um, our producer, Alex, is a girl and uh, she's a big pod.\nHuge pthead.\nLike real deal.\nSo, as as podcast producers are also a mother and a wonderful producer.\nAnd a mother.\nYes.\nUm, better producer than mother.\nNo, she's great.\nSo, I pull, I had the smelling salts and I, I was like, \"Oh, these are [ __ ] strong.\"\nThey're really particularly strong smelling salts.\nSo, then I go, \"Alex.\"\nI was like, \"This weed is [ __ ] great.\nGive it a whiff.\"\nThen I gave her the smelling salt container.\nShe put her nose in it.\nDude, she sniffed so hard.\nYou know how ptheads want to smell weed.\nShe, I mean, it was a 30-minute problem.\nShe said the word why a lot.\nIt was like when Nancy Carrian got her slugged out by the [ __ ] she's like, \"Why?\nI sweat blood for you.\nI flew here for to help you produce a show.\nSee, I felt so bad.\nYou should not do that.\nThat was, it was a, I, I now it was a bad prank.\nBut if it was a dude, that's big of you.\nIf that was a dude, is it not just undeniably hilarious?\nBrutal.\nYeah.\nIf it's a guy, it's funny.\nYeah.\nFunnier.\nYeah, it's funny.\nIt's weird.\nIt wasn't funny.\nDo it to a guy, it's funny.\nDepend on the guy, you know?\nLike if you, you know, if you did it to David, it would be mean.\nNo, be funny.\nYou do to Kurt Mezer, he just starts punching balls.\nHe starts rattling off conspiracy theories.\nPretty girls being embarrassed though is funniest [ __ ] Hilarious.\nIt is the most evening factor ever.\nI did a uh, when I was on tour with the bands years ago, uh, K did Joerger Meister music tour, they always had the Jager girls would hang out and I was on the Joerger Meister production bus on this tour.\nSo the girls would all come on there.\nThey were come and hang out and drink for free on the bus.\nAnd you know tour buses, you're not allowed to [ __ ] on a tour bus.\nAnd only one of the Jagger girls asked if she could use the bathroom.\nIt was just in the time we were there.\nAnd she went, \"Gorgeous girl.\"\nAnd she came back out and she was sitting down.\nAnd then the driver comes to start getting the bus ready to leave.\nAnd just, you know, a toothless [ __ ] road dog just comes in the bus.\nYou go, \"Somebody took a shit.\"\nAnd everybody knew it was this hot chicken fishnetss.\nAnd I mean just the thing I was like she was so beautiful that me probably in my heaviest in my life I was like I probably could get her now.\nShe's the [ __ ] girl.\nNo one's seeking her out and I'll still do it.\nHilarious.\nYou can't clean up that good in a [ __ ] So it's such a function that everybody has, but for some reason I never want to hear about a woman [ __ ] ever.\nNow what about the, the Why don't they develop a toilet that you can [ __ ] on on a bus?\nIs that beyond our science?\nI don't know why it can't be.\nI'm sure there's something that can be done.\nIt seems like it should be done.\nI think they're just being lazy.\nNo [ __ ] on the tour bus.\nWait, what if you have to take a [ __ ] That's crazy.\nBut they have to empty it out.\nThat's the problem.\nSo they, I think you, you can, you can [ __ ] on the tour bus, but the person that has to clean the toilet has to now empty out your [ __ ] amongst the piss like manually with like a hose and [ __ ] That's what's crazy.\nSome dude's job that he has to like deal with.\nThere should be somewhere where you could pull over and those rest stops have like a thing that sucks your [ __ ] out.\nYeah.\nLike out of the tank.\nYeah.\nThat'd be very profitable for them.\nWhat are they going to do?\nThey'd have to store your No, you figure it out.\nThat's the last thing you want to do is be in [ __ ] storage.\nTruck stop.\nYeah.\nTruck stop.\n[ __ ] story.\nThey're sucking my [ __ ] out outside.\nI'm in here buying jerky.\nNo.\nWhen the Dave Matthews band incident in Chicago, that's right.\nThe bus driver let that stuff out over the water and a boat went underneath it and it splattered the boat with doodoo from Dave Matthews band.\nDidn't you see a thing recently where they got, they show like a cruise ship or something just letting [ __ ] out of the front?\nUh, I don't think that's real.\nI think I thought that was real too.\nI think that's like dredging.\nI'll be suckered in a heartbeat by an AI thing.\nOh yeah.\nDo you know that super hot down syndrome girl isn't isn't real?\nDamn.\nThat only fans AI down syndrome girl.\nOh, don't know it.\nGod, bro, nothing's real anymore.\nHow many videos have you seen?\nLike I, I saw a thing about Trump saying that they were going to genetically engineer raptors and have the [ __ ] troops ride them to protect the border.\nThat's not real.\nBut it's like you see them that you know they bl brought back the direwolf and could it be done?\nIt's like it's so hard to tell.\nWeaponizing dinosaurs would be the funniest thing in the world.\nStart over.\nOh, is that fake?\nWell, all this, it's like a quick series of four or five little fake ones, but they look, they look real and then they just go like, \"This isn't real.\"\nBy the way, hi from the Cedar Grove flood disaster.\nJust kidding.\nI'm not real.\nThis is Dana Brooks reporting live from Ocean View Beach.\nJust kidding.\nI'm not real.\nThis is Charlotte Reed reporting live from

just like I was like, I know this is not Joe glazing this [ __ ] weird company for, you know, a 10-minute read.\nI was like, they really got him to do this, huh?\nSo strange.\nYeah.\nDo you try to put a stop to that or you just say, \"Fuck it?\"\nYeah, you try.\nBut the guy who made that took 25 minutes.\nWow.\nI told a uh, I told, I told a racist street joke on Legion of Skanks 10 years ago and me saying the N word has been used in so many memes and little But it's black people react to it and they, it's such a funny street joke that they can't deny it.\nIt's like an undeniably funny thing.\nSo it's always black people trying to not laugh and they say it and I'm like that's pretty good.\nThat's pretty funny.\nPretty great street joke.\n[ __ ] Some words are coming back.\nThat one's not one of them.\nNo, bro.\nThese ICE raids are [ __ ] nuts, man.\nWatching this, this protest on television, it's like You think the raids are nuts?\nThe pro the Yeah.\nides are taking it a little Well, I don't think if they the Trump administration, if they're running and they said, \"We're going to go to Home Depot and we're going to arrest all the people at Home Depot.\nWe're going to go to construction sites and we're going to just like tackle people at constructions.\"\nI don't think anybody would have signed up for that.\nThey said, \"We're gonna get rid of the criminals and the gang members first.\"\nRight.\nAnd now we're, we're seeing like Home Depot get raided.\nLike that's crazy.\nYeah.\nAnd then you've got this uh, big protest that's scheduled for the 14th that's literally funded by the lady who owns Walmart.\nThe protest uh, the protest.\nIt's like no kings.\nIt's like a no kings protest that's happening all across the country.\nAnd rapists and you know obviously but then they go to like a college campus and there some kid about to graduate they're like no you're out it's [ __ ] up rapist criminals slow delivery people um ones that can't dance or play the flamco guitar I've got a list um I think it's [ __ ] crazy how violent it's gotten I don't they're throwing bricks over overpasses that's what I mean but again I think all these things 90% of the people that are there are just like let's rage [ __ ] Oh, 100%.\nAlso, there's people that are with Black Lives Matter to protest.\nYeah.\nThey're saying they're uh That's always the bricks.\nPiles of bricks are showing up like there's construction sites around the city.\nNo, no, no.\nThat was weird, dude.\nI was in the city during that time.\nYou were too during the pandemic.\nNo, those bricks were just [ __ ] out there.\nI live on a police block.\nI was barricaded in with them.\nYeah.\nAnd I felt\n\n\nBad for the black cops. I was going to be yelling at the black cops, and the black cops be like, \"Sorry, man.\" And I'd have my hand on his shoulder like, \"You're going to be all right.\"\n\nVideo of the cops getting the rocks thrown at them from the overpass. It's crazy. They have to hide under the overpass. They're throwing them at the cops. I mean, you're 100% possibly killing somebody. Yeah, it's attempted murder. You could with a cinder block brick onto someone's head from an overpass. They're probably dead. It's a good chance. Good chance. I mean, if Lord of the Flies taught us anything, that's how Piggy died. That's who I related to.\n\nThis kind of can escalate. I'm thinking of The Good Son where they push the dummy off the overpass. Oh yeah, remember, make him think they killed somebody. It's It's pretty wild what's going. But I mean, I don't know. Like I said, everybody running out of like Louis Vuitton with a bunch of like shirts and is you seen that? Oh yeah. Oh, that's happening too. Oh, they're looting. Yeah. Oh, they're looting. I didn't know they were looting too. Hardcore. And I said it's funny, which if I was a 19-year-old kid, I would be out there looting unquestionably. Well, it's as soon as lawlessness happens, people take advantage. It's that's always going to be the case, right? That's I think the whole it is fun. I mean, like these cops are just standing though and like just under non-stop graffiti. It's like murder all cops. They're just like sitting there. It's like and the people are try some people try to talk reason to them to the cops. Like why don't you do the right thing and not shoot me with a rubber bullet? Like, well, you know what the problem is? The problem is there's cops that just shoot people with rubber bullets for no reason. Did you see that lady though, Australian reporter that got shot? Did you see that video? It's pretty hilarious. It's nuts cuz you see the guy do it. You see the cop just look at her while she's talking. She's clearly not a criminal. She's just reporting the news. And he shoots her in the leg with a rubber bullet. The leg's hilarious. It's a really good stuff. Let's watch this.\n\nThat's funnier than making my producer smell smelling salts. Dude, it's a real dance moment. Dance, It's crazy. It I mean, I can't I can't believe that he would do this. This is the Jake. Go full screen, please. Situation has now Watch this. This is nuts. The LAPD moving in on horseback, firing rubber bullets at protesters, moving them on through the heart of LA. She's got that shitty Australian accent, though. Watch this.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nDance, Bro, they just shot a reporter. Like, look, that guy just points and says, \"Fuck this lady.\" It's going to be good promotion, though, for her 2,000 person gang bang she's doing on Only Fans this summer. I mean, what is that? Do you want to know why people get angry at cops? It's like that. I would say you shoot a white woman every couple minutes and everyone starts going like, \"Oh, they're shooting everybody.\" Is that a thing where you're kicking everybody out of the street and the press thinks they don't have to listen? So, you don't want to listen. You're tired of this and you decide to shoot her in the leg, which is insane. That's so insane. You don't You don't yell, \"Lady, get out of the street.\" Was there a shooter? This one happened too. After this minute goes down, this guy ends up shooting him at close range. What is this about? 40 mm. Yeah, I'm not going anywhere. What's your badge number? That's okay. I'm going to pop you right now cuz you're taking up my focus.\n\nWhoa. I'm going to pop you right now cuz you're taking up my focus. Look, it's not okay. It's not okay. But I will say I grew up at a time where if you talk to cops, nobody had camera phones, nobody had anything. A cop would just you up. And there's something hilarious about that cop just shooting that guy in the dick. There's a thing about them rubber bullets. Like you're shooting somebody, but you're not shooting them. You're kind of half shooting them. Yeah. Right. But it's you are like you. What you want to do is shoot them. All right. And you're not allowed to. It's against the law and it's not right. So you shoot them with a rubber bullet. And it's not right. But you can shoot people when you really shouldn't be shooting them with a rubber bullet. Getting shot in the dick with a rubber bullet could have irreparable damages. 100%. People have lost eyeballs, bro. 2020, this guy had to have portions of his genital. I do have a hard time feeling. What? Say what? Say that again. Read it. Says there he later had to have surgery to reattach portions of his genitalia. Portions. What are they serving it? How big is this guy's dick? What kind of a dick does this guy have? I wish I wish my dick could be cut up into portions. How weird is that? He just knocked out the middle. Is it Which one you having for breakfast? Oh man. If he break If he broke the middle off, I'd be like, \"Could you give me a longer middle?\"\n\nCan you put a longer middle back on? A good extension.\n\nI don't care if it's a different color. Just try to match it as best you can. All this gene editing. How far away are away from big dicks? Oh, you think it'd be the first thing? I think they have been working. Depends who comes up with the science. If the Asians come up with the science, that's first thing. Well, they have the science with the genetic engineering. Oh, you're saying before your baby's born, you'd be like, \"Hey, also I want my son to have a huge dick.\" Big dick. That's a weird con. You go, I'm thinking monster . If you just let your kid have a regular dick and all his friends have giant dicks. That'd be a real problem. Your kid would be so upset. You mean you could have given me a giant dick as well? No. I wanted people to like you for you. I I needed money for bowling. Oh, great. I'll be upstairs jerking off with three fingers. If anyone needs me alone with no friends. I just remember being like 12 being like, \"When is it going to grow? Like, when's it going to get big?\" And it just never really did. You just kept having that conversation with yourself. Yeah. Up and Up and Love is a full-fledged adult that I don't like. Now's the time. It's a sketch on Sigura's new show. There's some That's a funny show. funny show, man. The Hitman one was hilarious. Yeah, they were. I thought the the video game where the uh the you play with aliens raping humans.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nHe said it wasn't it wasn't about the guy and it said part two was called Evans Revenge. Oh, Jamie, speaking of UFOs, did you see Lou Alzando? These photos that are supposedly of a real alien. Oh, here we go. Bro, it's so dumb. The photos look blurry of the photos of the dead alien. Like, you can't even zoom in on that. You can't even focus. Look at these. Yeah, that thing. Look at that. What is that? What's that? What is that, dude? How about better pictures? This is crazy. These are the only pictures. Is this from the 40s? Like, what's this picture from? What is this?\n\nOh, people want to believe, bro. So bad. Me, too. I'm like, maybe maybe the bottom ones. It was funny. Somebody asked me, you know, um Sean Donnelly and Dan St. Germaine have a podcast now about alien encounters and all that kind of stuff. And they and they both really believe it. And they were like, \"What would it take for you to believe, Jay?\" I was like, \"Irrefutable evidence.\" I have to shake hands with an alien. The one the one thing I've never seen, irrefutable evidence. There's a lot of shenanigans going on this on the back of one of those photos. Alien. Oh. 1993 alien hybrid child uh born to a 15-year-old girl, subject of ET genetic experiment, under chin, neck, and upper torso view, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, that's under chin and then what's the other photo? It's the same. It's just the same. It's just one photo. Wasn't there another one? It seems like there's two photos. That's just this particular one. That but at the top. Yeah, the one on the bottom. What's that one on the bottom? The one on the bottom seems a little like turned to the side, right? Is that the eyeballs supposedly?\n\nOne of those What are those babies called that are born like that? Oh, Harley Quinn babies. Yeah, it could be anything, man. I mean, it might not even be human. I mean, it might not even be, you know, who knows. Do you think I mean like someone like Donald Trump can hold in the information like his daily day? You don't think? I don't think they tell him. I don't think he cares. Playing golf. But who can sit on that information if you know that? Wouldn't it be terrifying to to, you know, it's almost that to play someone who knows about aliens uh existing, you think also breaks off and plays golf and Yes. decides what they want to have for dinner tonight? 100%. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I think uh finding out vampires exist, it would change everything. I think it's a fun way to have information that you don't give to the rest of the world. And if you're the head of a giant defense contracting agency that's been back engineering UFOs for the last 50 years, it' be probably pretty cool to know some that other people don't know and not tell anybody and still go to brunch. But how are you not so consumed that you go, \"Oh, you want to start a new there's want to start a new Netflix series tonight?\" Like it just seems like uh you'd be cons. It's the same way I don't believe people have like speaking of the dead powers or psychic powers. I'm like you'd be you know what I mean? It's never like oh what is that? Tell your loved one that you miss them terribly. Uh, they miss you terribly. I'm actually You guys went to McDonald's. I'll treat myself to some MC. Like, how did your mind go anywhere else but like I'd speak to the dead? That would be consuming. I would never sleep. Supernatural all day talking to somebody about the War of 1776. You just go nuts. It's just not real. There was a video. Imagine you can just tune in anytime and talk to like some Civil War soldiers. You don't have a fa You don't go pick out a new pair of sneakers while that's going on. I need new sneakers. I think you see that video where it was like somebody, it might not even I don't know if it's real, but she was like a girl who has like paranoid schizophrenia and she created like a video of what it's like to have schizophrenia. Oh my god. It's like these like floating like almost like Yeah. like monsters sort of. Yeah. But they're like translucent and it's like all these voices whispering. It's like if that if that's how it really is to have schizophrenia that I mean I couldn't make it a day. Yeah. It I think it varies like a lot of different neurological conditions, right? I think, you know, there's extreme versions of it and some people have like mild schizophrenia, which is really weird. Well, I'm I've been impress I have someone close to me in my life that's had mania where they go like manic. Mhm. And I've only seen it twice. It's Hulk Hogan. It's Hulk. I've only seen it twice. But I mean, I'm blown away by how much your brain can like change functionality in a day. In a in a day's difference being like everything's changed. you know, they're saying things that they've never said before and believing it and being like, you know what I mean? It's very strange. Well, if you think about your body, scary. Yeah, it is scary. But if you think about your body as a whole, things go wrong in your body and well, things go wrong in your brain, too. It's like, you know, you can't blame someone for having liver cancer, right? Sometimes people just get weird diseases, you know, and the the mental thing is a weird one, man, because there there's people that it's just like something isn't clicking. It's just not working right, you know, and they don't know what to do and they're out there in the world and they're trying a bunch of different medications on them and they don't know what to do. So, you can't be mad at Kurt Mezer. Can't be mad at me. I couldn't imagine. This is what I always try to I always try to think about when I'm talking to somebody. I can't imagine what it's like to be them. Like, what is it like? What's it like to be mess? Oh my god. What's it like to be filled with conspiracies just over and know so much about like secret societies and nobody believes you? Yeah. And nobody believes you. And And everyone's kind of like, \"Hey, man. We're just trying to smoke a joint in the green room.\" Bro, he hovers. He hovers over you like a gargoyle. He's a goon. He's this giant dude. And he hovers over you\n\n\nOh, you didn't know? Last time I was out in LA, when he still lived in LA, he came over to the Airbnb I was at, and always with Kurt. I haven't seen Kurt always in like months and months between when I get to see him. He's one of my oldest, closest friends in comedy. He's my daughter's godfather, you know, very close to him. And then I was like, which is a crazy choice. Yeah, it's great. That's on Jay. It was a strange choice, but he's a good godfather. He's a great guy. He's great. And uh, yeah, him and my daughter have a great relationship. It's fantastic. But he is a whacker for sure. And he came into the house. I was like, \"My man, it's good to see you.\" And he goes, \"You know, the PD uh thing is real.\" And that's why Usher, that that audio of him [ __ ] that guy was real. And that's and he got Usher first. That's why Usher, remember when Usher uh was gone for a year because he had to get his [ __ ] sewn back together? Like what? What?\n\nHe just rattles him off, and then he'll go to Libya. All of a sudden, you're talking about Libya. Gaddafi. Remember the thing with Gaddafi? Like, I don't, dude. He, he's one of the people that texts like the way he texts. It's not just like he won't send you like one long text about like just everything he has to say. He has every sentence is a new sex. So you're just getting like, it just seems manic. Just full on.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by BetterHelp. Sometimes it can feel like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. And for guys especially, it can feel like you have to carry that burden on your own. There's a lot of stigma around men being the provider to keep it all together by themselves.

What's going on with them?\" He just corners you. He just corners you. But I love it. I can listen to him all day long. He's the best podcast. The best podcast guest. He's He's like He's just a You just have to rein him in like Owen Benjamin. Like, go this. That was a fun one. Take him this direction. Go in this direction, cuz he's just It just never stops coming out of his mouth. He's just He's a jokewriting machine. No, he's a genius. I say his day-to-day personality is genuinely I always describe Kurt, he's the first person I see that price of genius where it's like he's so great at being funny and his mind works such a thing, but his mind, his brain when you're not talking to him, maybe even when you're talking to him, is just like it's like a division sign, just formulas, just formulas going like that meme.\n\n100% that's how I feel like when I'm talking to Elon. Same thing, like you can tell there's like numbers running in his background and [ __ ] going on, he's trying kind of figure something out while you're talking. Yeah. I mean, he's he's clearly on the spectrum, you know? I mean, that's that's how you make rockets and electric cars and also on Twitter at the same time. Be addicted to Twitter. Like, where's your time coming from? And you're playing Diablo.\n\nReally, like where is I couldn't imagine being that rich and ever opening Twitter. Like, if I was that, like I was just like, I'm just definitely above tweeting. I think really rich guys. Um, one thing that happens if you're really rich and people are stopping you from communicating and you get pissed off and you think, \"Well, [ __ ] it. I can just buy Twitter.\" Like, nobody would do that normally. You get you need a wild person like Elon to do that. That's a wild move to say, \"I'll just buy Twitter,\" and then pay them way more than it's worth. And then everybody says you're a terrible businessman because your company lost $20 billion dollar in value in the first year. But it's like, no, it wasn't worth 44 billion. He paid 44 billion for it because he wanted it. It wasn't worth that. Like, how was it worth that? And then we found out a ton of [ __ ], man, that we wouldn't have found out about, like censorship and like what what's directing it? Like, it's what's keeping us at each other's throats? You're saying almost just in the basic level of like someone his age, like doing the same action that like a girl flopping on her bed in her tummy and kicking her knees up is like doing like like whatever. Trump's stupid. He's on he's on the list. Yeah. I just I if I was I just You made it. You don't need You don't need to prove anything else. You made it. Yeah. What else you got to prove? Let him find out in the newspapers. Doesn't matter. It's not a good look. I mean, if I had if I just simply I mean, if I got a if I if I double my net worth, I'm going to [ __ ] I'm going to disappear from public life altogether, much less Elon. That's insane. I think you're aware when you have a lot of money of how many different entities are manipulating society. I think that becomes an issue, and if you can do something about it and you feel compelled to do something about it, you're literally one of the only people that can. Do you think that he did do something about it? He definitely did when he bought Twitter. Twitter changed. He definitely did with Doge, just exposing some of the wild [ __ ] like billions of dollars. It's gone to who knows where with no receipts.\n\nAnd but did they even do anything about it really or just expose it? People talk about it for a week. They don't do anything about the money that's gone. I mean, unless they can somehow or another figure out where it was spent and whether it was valid and hold someone accountable, they they're not going to do that because they want to make sure that that doesn't happen to them, and they're just going to keep spending insane amounts of money. I feel like they're still spending. They they were like, \"Hey, this is happening, but it's still going to continue to happen for the rest of your lives.\" Well, here's the thing. If the if it's been funding the Democrat machine for this whole time, which is what guys like Mike Benz alleged, it's a little over my head to really explain, but essentially we're saying that the there's so many NGO, you want to know how how many NGOs there are? There is uh one NGO in India for every 600 people. I'm I don't know what an NGO is, and neither is Jay [ __ ] idiot, dude, just so you know. Government organization, no, tell him, yeah, sorry. Non-governmental.\n\nIt's just a nonprofit. So, it's a nonprofit that's funded by the government. It's It's real weird stuff, man. When you find out about it, when future reference, if you can make all your acronyms, just say the whole word out so Luis gets stupid idiot. I I should assume that no one knows about that. No, I come on. You do, but I should assume cuz I didn't know about until I started talking to Mike Benz about it. I was like, \"Wait, what? Like, how much money?\" And when you find out where the money was going and what it was doing, it's like he said it's all for stuff that's too dirty for the CIA. I was like, \"Jesus Christ.\" And he lays it out like hours long presentation and explains how it's all what's what's the root of it all. And it's like it's really spooky stuff cuz you you realize like how corrupt our society actually truly is. Do you enjoy having the burden of information though? No, I [ __ ] hate it. Why? Like where does your Bigfoot podcast? Where does your like political give a [ __ ] stop? Really? Well, I just don't want the world to fall apart. That's all it is. I just I'm not politically aligned with either the left or the right. I believe in a lot of [ __ ] that the left believes in. Sure. And I believe in a lot of [ __ ] that the right believes in. I just don't believe in any of the [ __ ] that the extremists on either side believe in. That's the problem. Yeah. This is Yeah. When you're [ __ ] attacking people at construction sites, it's like come on. Like what are you what are we doing? Like you want everybody out. I feel like once you get in,\n\nlet's take a test. Don't think, you know, like are are do you are you the type of guy that shows up at work? Are you the type of guy that uh respects America? Do you like being here? Is it too easy to get in though? You had a great analogy about the movie theater. I love my movie theater analogy is killer. It's a great analogy. I said, I've snuck into a movie before, sit in an empty seat that no one's taken. It's not even taking up any kind of space. If they come in and go, \"Hey, where's your ticket?\" I go, \"I don't have one.\" They go, \"You have to go. You got to go, man. And I can't you can't be like, \"Ah, dude, I've already watched an hour of it. So what?\" And I feel like you should let them finish the movie. That's a good um I'm just saying I'm not even saying you shouldn't let I'm saying it's discretion to let them finish the movie or not. I'm just making the point to be like you. Well, this movie theater was built on my people's land or [ __ ]. It's just to me it's just like a weird like reaction to getting caught being like, \"Well, but I've already been here.\" It's like I've gotten away with it for so long. Yeah, it's kind you steal someone's stuff and they find it 20 years later, you go, \"Well, it's been mine for 20 years.\" But also, I I totally agree with you and it's a funny joke, but also if you're living in Mexico and you're a young person and you figure out a way to sneak across the border, you get gainfully employed in the United States, you start doing well, you you're involved in a business, you start raising a family, but there's no real path to citizenship because you snuck in, but you've actually become integrated in society and you're part of the American dream. Sure. It's just there's no path if you're dirt poor. That's the problem. See, if you're living in Denmark and you're white and you got a college degree and you're really good at genetics, you want to come over here and work for a lab, probably not that hard. You got to jump through hoops, though. You got to meet with the guy every six months or whatever it is. You got to fill out the paperwork. But if you're walking here from Mexico, you know, there's no no clear path to citizenship. You know, you got to marry a fat white woman, find a desperado. Yeah. I mean, there's no there's no clear path. And especially if you're integrated into like uh I there was a a guy that I had was my landscaper for a long time in uh LA. He was Danish. He w he came Dutch. He came from Mexico. He walked across from Mexico. It's like and he lived in these communities like he took me to uh they they had chicken fights in their communities and this dude had just roosters stacked up everywhere. It was like there was like a hundred roosters in this guy's backyard. Not my landscaper, but his friend. He took me to his friend's place. They would barbecue a goat and cook and there wasn't a English-speaking sign for blocks and I was like you should have [ __ ] paid him more. So like my point is I beat him well. That was not my point. My point is like serious chicken fights completely integrated societies that are a part of LA that are fully Mexican, you know, and but it functions. It works like going in and raiding those people and putting them in jail because they've integrated into society in an illegal way. It seems and then all the people that are going it's like is my tax dollars like guys the amount of [ __ ] that our tax dollars goes to that's that should be a priority over getting a [ __ ] Mexican dad out of the country. It's like Joe, it sounds like you just want to keep barbecued goat in this country. Well, here's the problem. The problem is if they're illegal, right, which is what everybody wants to keep it that way because what if you let them vote and this if they're illegal, then you don't have to pay them as much. And this is where it's dark. This is the dark secret of why people want cheap labor in this country because there's a lot\n\n\nOf people that don't pay people what they're supposed to be getting paid. It's non-union. They're illegal. Everyone knows. And they want cheap labor. Cheap, dependable, reliable labor. So, they let people in for that.\n\nTim Dylan was talking to me about this a long time ago because you know he used to be a real estate guy, like he understands like the dynamics of it all, like that is a big part of what they want, why they're bringing people in. But the reality is, yeah, you should just pay people more money. You should make less money. You should pay them more money. You should pay them enough money so they can live. Like you just to to try to have a giant business that pays people the least amount possible, that's it's kind of crazy. That's most businesses I know, but that's kind of crazy. It's kind of a crazy thing to do.\n\nVery interesting. My uh my ex-wife's, both her parents are immigrants, and you'd be surprised how not like uh sad they feel for people being kicked out. Like they're like, I think they have a very like if like we had to figure out how to do it legally. That's what a lot of people, but that's also how people felt like when uh people were unvaccinated. Yeah. I had to take the shot, you know, like why don't you take the shot? I had to take the shot.\n\nI didn't have to. I sought it out so hard. Did you? Yeah. Jay was paranoid. certain I was dying. Yeah. A lot of a lot of people got scared. Yeah. I I took it. You scared the [ __ ] out of us. I took it and then I faked the second one, the booster, cuz I realized that there's no way to these there. It's a piece of paper. It's a card with like some random name on it. Like it was like I was like, there's no way they're actually tracking this. My daughter made one on her phone to go into a Cheesecake Factory. It's pretty impressive.\n\nThey're going to absolve you of that crime. It'll be in the future. It's be like when they uh all the people that dodged the draft. Yeah. They they exonerated. Wait, did I just admit to a crime on this podcast? It was a crime. They were they were saying they were going to prosecute people. I remember saying that there was people that were saying if you try to use a fake vaccination card, we're going to prosecute you. Like Yeah, but that's like saying they're going to put you in jail for not going to jury duty. That doesn't actually happen. Yeah, but that's way crazier than that because that's like this whole thing is nuts. Like you're telling people they have to do this to get on an airplane. It doesn't even work.\n\nHave you ever had the tie wraps at Cheesecake Factory? I'll risk it.\n\nDo do they come to you for Have you ever done jury duty? I haven't done it. No. Like that's If Joe Rogan showed up to do jury duty, it'd be wild. Are you familiar with this case? I'm familiar with everything. I I'm a little familiar with everything. Mildly. Yeah. I think I uh interview the defendant and the plaintiff. I've never done jury duty either. I' I haven't gotten a notification in years and years and years, but I just ignore them back.\n\njust ded one recently pretty hard. You You just flat out moved. Tim Dylan was just talking about it on um the spicy wings show. What? Hotes. Tim was talking about how he did dur for a murder trial. Really? Yeah. The guy was a [ __ ] murderer. See, he did it recently. Yeah, he was talking about it recently. The guy It was a long time ago, but uh he he was uh did jury duty and he was like joking around with the defendant. If I was guaranteed that, I'd go uh show up. It's just what you're gonna get is like a tax something or a business uh argument, right? Or some kind of [ __ ] and that's boring as hell. You have to pretend to be racist to get out of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got to schizophrenia.\n\nI hate uh what's the last name of the one guy? Watkins. I hate black people.\n\nJeremiah Watkins. I'm a little too opinionated to be Yeah. I mean, that's what I'd say. I'm a little too opinionated. The only time I ever showed the only time ever I showed up I wore I was wearing jean shorts and they said you can't wear shorts to and I go what do I do? They go back you'll go back into the pool and just go home and they sent me home. They sent him into a pool cuz he's wearing shorts. Yeah, nice shorts idiot. Get in the pool. You can't offend people with your wardrobe at this place of the law.\n\nI guess so. How when did they stop wearing the wigs and the [ __ ] crazy like you know did they do it here? Do they still wear those? I think so. They don't wear the wigs anymore, right? We first came from uh\n\nOh, like Pilgrim Court.\n\n[Music]\n\nOkay. How stupid is it that everybody had wigs on? They still have it in England to this day. The judges still wear it. It's crazy. And Jewish women, religious Jewish women. You know where and any black woman came from? Syphilis, the wigs. Yeah. Yeah. How so? All the the people This is what this is a So this the story is a little complicated. This may or may not have been exactly how it happened, but it seems like when explorers came to North America, they contracted syphilis from the natives and then brought it back to Europe. And then a lot of people were getting syphilis. These people were freaks. They're all [ __ ] each other. And they were losing their hair and getting big holes in their face and [ __ ] Like syphilis is crazy. Like rots your head away. And so they started wearing wigs because they had like big scabby holes in their head. Like literally, it's horrific [ __ ] And the more wealthy you were, the bigger the wig. So that was like big wigs. That's what the term big wigs come from. It comes from these these freaks that all had syphilis that were all banging each other. If you have money, you're [ __ ] just getting [ __ ] left and right. So So there was these two um two guys that were royals and they started it all. They started wearing the wigs when they got syphilis. Wow. That's crazy. Nuts. So it all dials back. It's still It's not the white man's fault. these dirty ass Indians. It has to be dirty Indian [ __ ] It has to be why they wear wigs in court. It has to be right. Like it has to be like a proper thing like wearing a tie or something like a gentleman wears a wig. I should start wearing a wig. How fun would that be? A powdered wig. I thought about getting a a toupee recently just to be funny and just show up with like a really high quality toupee. Jamar does that. Yeah, I know. He wears a mohawk to his head. You should get a hair system, not a toupee. No, dude. I'm not going to another country to get my [ __ ] ass hairs implanted. Not an implant, just a system. It's like a different It's like more permanent toupee. It really looks Dude, I saw a video today where this doctor was talking and a doctor that I know was talking, Gar Fischer is his name. He was talking about his clients that went down to Turkey to get a gastric bypass operation. And then a couple months later, they're like, &quot;My stomach's bothering me.&quot; And the doctor's like, &quot;Oh, let's check out what's going on with your stomach.&quot; how long have you only had one kidney? And she's like, I have two kidneys. He goes, no, you have one kidney. And then contacts the other two girls that were on the trip. They all come in to get examined. They're all missing a kidney as well. So, they went down to Turkey to get a bypass, a gastric bypass, and they stole their [ __ ] kidneys. Brilliant.\n\nYo, not bad, bro. Imagine out there stealing body parts. You only have one kidney. That's crazy.\n\nI mean, guess it's better. At least you did. They also get the gastric bypass though. They did, but I think they paid for it, you know. Wow. What if it cost a kidney to get gastric bypass? There's fat people that would do that, right? What if they didn't read the fine print? Yeah. And it just cost you this. Here's why it's so cheap. We need a kidney. It's free. If you have a How much is a kidney on the black market worth? That's a good question, Jamie.\n\nDon't Google that. We'll off the off the dome. Yeah. Where does your uh Let's guess. Where does your circle How big is your circle of give a kidney if they need? Oh, it's very small. Yeah. Yeah. You're gonna have to figure that out. Is it? I'm not giving up kidneys. Just like uh what happens if you already kidney? Uh not good. What I mean like not as good as two. That's why you have two. Hello science. Catch up. [ __ ] stealing people's kidneys. You can live with one kidney, but how much does it affect your like day-to-day? Can you exercise still? Can you I I don't know.\n\nA very good question. I think you could live life relatively normal cuz people do it for loved ones. It's interesting that people get kicked in the kidneys all the time, but you don't really hear about too many like severe kidney injuries, you know? Like you hear about liver injuries, like you hear about internal bleeding from guys from body shots. Don't hear too much about kidney injuries, dude. Getting punched in the [ __ ] liver. It's the most painful thing weird on the planet, dude. It's a weird feeling. It's crazy. It'll It just shuts your body down. You roll around on the floor and start crying. I think I think Mickey Gaul told me his Mickey G kicked me in my kidney. He said he said Diego. Yeah. So I I sparred with Mickey G once and I spar with Michael Bispin once and both of them put me down with liver shot no I'm sorry liver shots not kidney liver shots like but they they called it is this how good fighters are like this is like hey watch this bang and they just put me down I mean literally the whole gym of people cackling laughing at me as I roll around on the floor is a man it's [ __ ] pathetic. Have you seen Ilia Tapora do that to people? He does it to fans. He hits him with a liver shot. They ask him. So he's livershotting bare knuckle. Ilia bare knuckle livershotting people. You would I'd rather be punched in the face 10 out of 10 times. But Mickey said when he lost to Diego Sanchez, it was cuz his kidney started shutting off. That's why he bit him in the face. I bet that is a weight loss. He said no, but he said it's from weight loss. Yeah, that's a brutal thing that they do, man. Like Kayla Harrison who just won the bantamweight title, bro. Oh, that picture of her weighing. She's so big. She's so jacked and that her getting down to 135. I don't know how much weight she's losing. I don't really want to ask, but I do. You know, you're not supposed to ask ladies what they weigh, right? But she was competing in professional fighting. Yeah. And when she was over at the PFL, she was fighting at 155. Really? Her picture her picture of her at the the actual weigh-in was like scary. Yeah. It's kind of [ __ ] up. It was like a thumbnail from like crack confessions like See, this is the problem. the UFC had a 145 pound division and Amanda Nunez was the champion of it. Like for the health of both fighters, like that would be a good way. I mean, it really depends on if Kayla Harrison can continue to make 135 and defend the title cuz I don't know who's going to beat her. She's too [ __ ] strong. She's so strong. That happens a lot with like the checks. There's like a real dominant check for a while. With Amanda, it was KO power. Amanda was one of the rare women that she could just touch you and just blast you out of orbit. You know, it's usually with women it's like a combination punches. Like Amanda had extraordinary power. Like when she knocked out Cyborg, that was wild, dude. That was [ __ ] She just folded Cyborg. I'm like, that lady can crack. What was the Was it Silva?\n\nThis last weekend there was a knockout. The guy was asleep standing. And it was the most softest looking turnover. Yes. Turn over like chin punch. The Korean dude. Yeah. Young like 23 years old. It was like he Joe Sang Yu. He moved and just like it was the smallest little like he didn't pull it from the shoulder or nothing. One of the best left hooks of all time. The guy was asleep before he hit the ground. One of the best left hooks of all time. It was literally like this. Bam. Like he just turned it over. And he's a kid, right? Yeah, he's young. No, he's not that young. No, no, no. Here it is. Boom. Look at that. I think he's 28. That's a lot of his momentum coming in, too. It's like the perfect place timing for sure. But he's also a really good boxer. You get knocked out and then some dudes doing back flips in the ring. That's the worst feeler in the world. I don't, by the way, I don't know how I would I'm not a good enough sport for if I was knocked out and they come over and start doing that thing where they're touching my face a lot and be like, &quot;Thank you for the opportunity.&quot; Get the [ __ ] away from me, [ __ ] A lot of people do. You [ __ ] jerk off. I don't want to talk to you. He goes, &quot;Hey, will you pray with me?&quot; No. Will you pray with me? To who? A god that hates my guts.\n\n[Laughter]\n\n[ __ ] That's so funny. I've been praying to God this whole training camp. I just got God just gave me a concussion. Thanks, God. That's\n\n\nHilarious. I guess God was training wrong. This lady's got a problem because if she, you know, other than the Amanda Nunes fight, who, well, who's going to pay to watch her just steamroll somebody, you know, like every if she can continue to make 135, if she becomes a marathon runner or something and drops even more muscle mass and can make 135, who the [ __ ] is going to be able to deal with that? Almost like Mike Tyson back in the day became a thing where they started like offering you money back on the pay-per-views if he if he didn't last at least two rounds. Yeah, that was the whole thing. It was like cuz he was knocking people out so fast. It was like, you know, I'm not paying for this. This is Everybody would look at a pay-per-view based on how long you thought the fight would last. Like $60, man. Yeah, it wasn't that much back then. But but I remember people being bummed out. It was like a 30 second knockout. But it was also fun to like it was almost like Mike Tyson his thing was he was so vicious and badass. That was kind of fun to watch somebody that dominant, you know. Yeah. But also the crazy I think with the UFC people like they want to they want the back and forth. They want five crazy fights. They want to like you feel like you're getting your money's worth. I remember after Tyson Holyfield the ear thing. Mhm. I ordered that pay-per-view and I was driving around that night afterwards listening to the radio and people were like like tons of complaining on sports radio. I'm like, you just watched a guy bite a another man's ear off. Like, if they would have sold it that way before $50 just for that. Yeah. Before the fight, if they were like, \"Watch a man eat another man's ear. Like, I'll pay anything you want.\" Didn't he bite him twice? Yeah. He didn't get it off the first time, though. Was for that fight. Dude, the fact that Mike Tyson has uh 50 bucks back then, has edibles that are earshaped is one of the funniest [ __ ] things on earth. The fact that they're friends now. Evander Mike is Evander Holy has no idea what's going on. He doesn't. He'd be friends with anybody. He is gone. Ski a Vander Holyfield. Is he? Oh, he he was on my podcast a few years back. He was really Yeah. back in LA. No, man. He was like super coherent back in LA. Damn. I mean, that was Few years ago. Seven years ago, maybe. How long ago was Evander on the show? Yeah. Did he fight VTO? Is that who fought Vtor? Yeah, that was unfortunate. I don't think he had a real camp for that fight either. Yeah. Yeah, I think that was a lastm minute replacement cuz uh VTO was supposed to fight somebody else, right? Yeah. Very few athletes will ever I think at this point I know there's bigger contracts now 2019 so six years ago but very few athletes will ever understand the idea of that like what those guys lives were like even like Riddic Bow like Rick B was champion for like two fights I mean you know what I mean he's awesome but he didn't have a long run or anything and then you see his thing it's like 14 acres with white tigers everywhere and all his clothes are silk like they're immediately like they were just getting handed $50 million a night in one night. I know it's like you train for that night, but that's a crazy amount of like no athletes get that. Yeah. Well, like anymore. Nothing like that. There's a few. Canelo does. Does he? Yeah. Canelo has a giant deal with this. Oh, but I mean maybe even boxing still has that with the pay-per-view like taken. I just mean some of these boxers you're making pretty [ __ ] nuts in my head. But that sport's the only sport that's I mean UFC has never paid like that, has it? Um, I don't know what the most amount anyone's been paid in the UFC for a fight. If I had to guess, it's got to be Connor. Yeah, without a doubt. Yeah. Um, I know Connor has made more than $100 million in the UFC, I believe. Yeah. See if that's a fact. Is that going all I shouldn't say that because I don't really know. I just read some article that tried to break down how much he made for each pay-per-view and how much he made um at the beginning of his career, you know, like when he first burst onto the scene. Yeah. It's uh I got two numbers in the first results that says 39.3 and then down here says 100 108. Yeah, it might include box. Yeah. So, there's like the pay-per-view bonuses versus like fight pay. So, what I was going to say is I thought he made $100 million from the Floyd fight. So, it can't be that. 30 million from that. So, 30 million. Oh, it says 30 million from the boxing match in Floyd. I thought it was a hundred million. And his biggest payout was against Kabib for 285 almost. Yeah, he's um so 28 million he's probably made the most. But his like he wasn't getting that was all a pay-per-view bonus. That was a huge pay-per-view. Mhm. Um Right. But but he did get paid. I mean that but that's the only way they get paid anyway. Yeah, of course. I mean the pay-per-view bonus thing is great because it forces him to promote, but I don't mind a silent killer. I don't mind an Alex Pereira. I don't want to see him promoted. He don't have to promote. That do promotes when he puts people into orbit, you know? Just let him train. Let him shoot a [ __ ] bow and arrow at a soccer ball. Let let him train. Like, don't [ __ ] pawn that guy out and have him do media everywhere. Like, get leave his energy alone. Like, you guys can do enough with promotion from his highlight reel. With a guy like Connor though, that [ __ ] guy like if he can get on the radio, if he can get on a talk show, if he can start talking [ __ ] he'll the the number Dana sees dollar bills like [ __ ] Scrooge McDuck. He's like start throwing gold coins in the air. Connor was the best at it. What about the a couple weeks ago, Aaron Blanchfield versus uh what was the girl she was fighting? They they cancelled it. They canceled it as it was starting. They already did the package for the main event and then they found out that Macy Barber had like passed out. She had a um a seizure backstage. I don't want to speak out of turn. So, it's some sort of medical condition and she was in trouble and so they sent her to hospital to get checked out. Yeah. I mean, they they literally said, \"All right, now it's time for the main event.\" And then they were like, \"Well, never mind. We're not doing it.\" Yeah. I don't again I don't want to speak out of turn, but I think she might have had some health concerns. She's had a bunch of health concerns over the last couple of years, I think. So, and then she missed weight, which is never a good sign. You know, when they miss weight, usually something's off. Yeah. A lot of times they're injured or sick or something. But whatever it was, sucks for That sucks for Blanchfield. Dude, you just She's actually from my hometown, Jersey. Oh, she's a beast, dude. Yeah, she's a monster. very good. Very young, too. Were you going to send him up, say something shitty about her, and then be like, I know her. Actually, really a dumb [ __ ] Oh, I grew up with her. What an ass. I was uh with uh Dave Porterfield, you know, he's a big fan of Meatball Molly McCann, who's great, too. But he's like, uh I'm betting on Molly. And I go, yeah. And he's like, you think? I go, dude. Like, Erin Blanchfield is the truth. Like, she's a [ __ ] problem. She's a problem. She gets a hold of Molly and she just ragdalled her. If you were going to Pete Rose your own sport, how do you you think you would hit good? Oh, I used to bet on it. Yeah, but I can't affect the outcome. So, I used in the early days of the UFC when they first started having lines in sports books, I would bet cuz I would see like you'd see [ __ ] like Anderson Silva, it's like if this isn't an 800 to one Anderson Silva versus Travis Lutter like okay. Uh-uh. That was that was different. Okay. Travis Lutter lost that fight in my opinion because he cut too much weight. You think he won the fight? He was he had him mounted early in the fight. Let me tell you something. Travis Lutter's Brazilian jiu-jitsu was [ __ ] elite. All the guys that I know that train with him like go, \"Dude, he's like Ricardo Laborio level.\" Like he's special. Like he he did the Ultimate Fighter and everybody was terrified. They're like, \"That [ __ ] gets you on the ground, you're in trouble. He's just a machine in jiu-jitsu.\" So, I saw him cut weight and he looked so bad. His lips were cracked. Wow. His face was sucked in and he was shuffling to the scale and he still didn't make weight. He never made weight. Oh, is that what happened? It wasn't a title fight. That's right. He wouldn't have won the title if he won. That was crazy. They used to give the winner of the Ultimate Fighter a title shot like back in the day. That was like a crazy like just sort of like prize. Like it's just changed. just turned into such more of a legitimate sport now that you can't just give like the winner of a reality show a title fight. America's Got Talent used to give a million dollar prize and then one day they just change like you just be part of an America's Got Talent show in Vegas. Did they always give you a title fight? Is that I think the first few seasons. Yeah. I think Travis had had a few fights in the UFC before that. Dude, that was uh long after the Ultimate Fighter. I'm about 90% sure cuz I know he knocked out Marvin Eastman. I remember that fight and you know he he fought quite a few dudes but the the main theme was when Travis got a hold of you you were [ __ ] and he got a hold of Anderson and Anderson looked [ __ ] It was early in the fight but then he got Anderson got him in a triangle. He just tired out and Anderson was blasting him. When he first came in it was crazy. If you saw that guy the day before you would go, \"Oh my god, how is this guy even alive? He should be taken to a hospital. He looks so bad.\" I've seen a lot of people weigh in looking really bad but Travis was the worst. So, look at this. He's mounted on top of Anderson early in the fight, dude. I skipped ahead. He had him he was mounted for like two and a half minutes. Yeah. I mean, but he just gassed out, man. I mean, he just had nothing left. He lost too much weight, man. And so then Anderson got him in a triangle and started [ __ ] him up with elbows. So, they came a point in time where you could see him visibly fading, you know? Yeah. I think if Look at that mount, bro. Look how slick that is. I mean, this dude is so slick. Travis was so dangerous, man. He could have possibly submitted him, but he was just too big for the weight class. He shouldn't have been making that weight. So, that's that's my point. It's like, yeah, he was a live dog in this fight is my point. Yeah, he was tired there. That wasn't even really an escape that Anderson did. He lost way too much weight, dude. He was dead the day before. I mean, dead when I saw him. Dead. He looked like he might die. Have you ever gotten talk to a fighter about the psychology of like once you lose like when you're just like this dominant force and once you lose like your whole thing change like Roy Jones Jr. was overnight overnight they said that one guy called him out said he was ducking Tarver Tarver said he was ducking him then Antonio Tarver beat him then Glenn Johnson just beat him knocked him through the ropes. It was just like it became like you can just beat him but Glenn Johnson knocked him out where it was one of those scary ones where your arms are stiff. Yeah. And uh it didn't seem like he hit him that hard either. That was It seemed like it couldn't be real that it was happening. It was like that two fights before that was the fight was the fight I believe where he he's hitting the guy and he tells the ref he's like stop the fight and then the ref didn't and he hit him a few more times. Yeah. Then he passed the end. Like that was like uh two fights before it was just all over. Yeah. But you know what happened? Roy went up to heavyweight and he fought John Ruiz and then he dropped back down to light heavyweight and that's a real problem there. He's like he got knocked out. So it's like he's stiff dude. Like when you get knocked down and you're just like stiff here. GH Anderson Silva like that's so awful. Wasn't it pretty much Anderson after the leg went in the fight? Like it was just like he never really c he won fights since but he never really captured back like we're just going to watch him. We went first UFC we ever went to was 101 in Philly. The first one Forest Griffin a racist ass Philly that night for us in general was just a a hilarious thing. We went with it was me, Dave, and Lewis. All three of us. Uh, the first White Boy weekend. First White Boy weekend. We went to like a Ozfest or Mayhem Fest and then UFC. Uh, Lewis and Dave brought their friend who I was not getting along with and a girl who shout out Krypto. Krypto West. We used to um Lewis used to date a girl who became friends with the group sort of and she came with us also. And she was a we'll say she's a she's a chunkier girl. This is back. Look, this is back in the day when I was younger. It\n\n\nIt's like if you become friends with a girl, like you can't separate friendship. No one's going to see her. You don't have to over explain that you [ __ ] the girl that wasn't. No, she was really hot. I mean, she was. It's okay. Look, you know what? I'm saying now I wouldn't have dated her, but uh yeah, she was a little bit of a chunkier girl. And uh whatever it was that we were just we were just talking [ __ ] like, you know, watching the fights, everyone's just being animals. We ended up getting to a thing with these guys in front of us. Like it was like it was maybe four of us and I want to say maybe three of them. We might have outnumbered them. No, I don't think so. At first it was just there was like one or two guys just there. The other guys were gone. Yeah, we such a coyote trap. You show you one coyote, the rest of them surround you. And we we started talking [ __ ] with these guys. It just turned into like a, you know, I don't think we, I mean, we shouldn't make this up. We're not looking, none of us are looking for trouble, guys. The guys were, I think we were talking and saying [ __ ] like being funny, and I think they kind of were giving us like a bunch of you guys shut the [ __ ] up kind of thing. You know what I mean? Like we're being [ __ ] comedians and they're like really serious about watching an MMA fight right now. First one ever in Philadelphia. They turn around, they start talking [ __ ]. So then I, we start talking [ __ ] to them. We kind of chump the two guys, and then their group of friends show up and they get wind that they just got chumped by these [ __ ] loser comedians. They left the nerds behind and they went and got merch. Oh boy. So then these guys, you make the nerds get merged. We see what we're working with. It became a whole argument. These guys started talking [ __ ] to us. And by the way, we were above them. We could have [ __ ]. We should have just, oh, higher ground. We should have just dominated these guys. But whatever had happened, we just didn't want to fight and get kicked out. We're not like tough guys like that. So they start talking [ __ ]. And then this is like, it's such a fight. It's almost like when somebody spits on you. One of the guys goes, it was like, \"Yo, [ __ ] you.\" And [ __ ] your fat [ __ ] too, about the girl that I was seeing. And we all just acted like we didn't hear it. Everyone didn't hear it. We just commutely agreed without even looking at each other. We were like, \"Oh, these guys.\" Huh?\n\nShe sat there the rest of night. I can't believe these guys were ready to fight for everything except me. When that was the final goes, oh well, you should stick up for yourself, lady. And then we just sat there. She's a big girl. She could have helped. Then we went outside and pretended like we were waiting to find them as in a sea of 18,000 people being suck boy. God, we did look like jerkoffs there. Uh, um, but then that was so funny cuz it was Philly, which historically hilariously racist city, and which fight was that? It was Forest Griffin Anderson. Oh, that one was crazy. Forest Griffin, I mean, the the applause he got when he came out, the ovation he got, they couldn't wait. They loved him and they they literally booed Anderson Silva, and then Anderson Silva handled that hilariously and quick. Yeah. And uh, and then when they Far Griffin left immediately. He didn't stay. He ran right out of the ring, which was a thing, and then uh, they, you know, they announced the thing goes, your winner and still Anderson Silva, and the place booed. It was such a sweet moment because Anderson Silva seems like his personality is good. It seems like, and uh, and they were like booing and they had him on the big screen and Silva goes like he almost had like a really like, and he's like holding the belt and they're like, yeah, right, you son of a [ __ ], that was amazing and they cheered for him. Come on, man. Strange, but we saw we saw like an 18-year-old or 19-year-old Jon Jones just walking around the arena that night, and I didn't know uh, I got into UFC way early. Me and my stepup used to get like, you know, Ninja versus Sumo Wrestler. Oh, wow. UFC. And then when it got like uh rules and everyone was kind of like, you know, trying to start doing like actual MMA, uh, I lost track of it. And Lewis and Dave were super into it. So, you guys walk around. It's funny when the rules came, you checked out. Checked out. Um, me and Dave, we became we became friends. We were roommates in Brooklyn. We would go to the Blockbuster, rent the old UFC's. It was like Ultimate Knockouts, Ultimate Submissions. They had like a series of videos and uh, who was it? Mark Layman. He would teach you how to do moves like in the uh, there was like a segment where it's like, \"Hey kids at home, here's how you do a [ __ ] bar.\" So, me and Dave literally living in the shittiest, dirtiest apartment with like garbage everywhere and beer bottles everywhere. We would have grappling matches with our buddy Wes. My cauliflower ear didn't come from jiu-jitsu. This is from Dave Smith. He would Dude, he would literally open hand smack. We had open hand smacking rules and he would open hand smack me in the ear. Political punt. Maybe the best political pundit alive. How weird is that? I'm going to assassinate him. Dave was a pthead wigger who was grappling amongst garbage with me. So that's how he started on my couch for a couple years. Do you guys ever imagine he was going to be that good at like political commentary? I, you know what? I shouldn't say no. I didn't know he was going to go to be that kind of big in it. Uh, the fact that he is great at it doesn't surprise me at all. But it's his recall is nuts. It's interesting how like uh, because I said this was just a guy at a time. I said we smoked pot. We essentially raised my daughter like a gay couple during the day. Then my ex-wife would come home and then we head into the city and meet up with Luis J. Gomez. How many times did your ex-wife accuse you of doing gay [ __ ] with Dave? Several. You know what's funny? Before one of the reasons I was able to give while I was leaving when I left was uh, I went in her thing to see if she was, I was like, I should see if she's cheating also and I went through her computer and it was nothing about her cheating at all. It was several times looking up what to do when you find out your husband is gay. I was like, \"What? What?\" Imagine being a woman married to a guy and thinking he's secretly sneaking away in soccer and [ __ ]. That's a video that just went viral recently. The girl like caught her her boyfriend or husband. They look staged. I saw that. You saw. You think it was staged? I don't think so, dude. I don't think she's that good of an actress. I think a lot of these are staged. They might be. I mean, I think a lot of them are staged. She was losing her mind. Like, you're [ __ ] that guy. You're [ __ ] him, Chris. Really? Cheaters getting caught by their significant others, though. As much as I've felt that pain, I love those videos. That's a rabbit too. Remember the show Cheaters and the guy stabbed on a boat. All fake. All fake. All fake. I believe it. I've talked to so many people who've worked at Cheaters before and stuff and recently I wanted to be the host. They brought Peter Guns from Lord Tariq and Peter Guns Uptown Baby. Remember that song? Yeah. Uh, he became the newest host. Before him it was uh Gary or uh Clark Gable the third. It was like Clark Gable's grandson. Seriously, it was like Clark Ael thei or something. Uh, hosted. He died from a drug overdose. The original guy who hosted it was a guy named Tommy Habib. He was pretty great at it. Then the little guy got stabbed. Fake. Completely fake. Do you remember Morton Downey Jr.? Of course. He was the best. Mouth. He was the best. Yeah. He would just smoke on the show and just yell at people. He's like, \"All right, so you're a Nazi. Here's the Jewish Defamation League. Let's bring him out to fight.\" This is what's crazy. There was a guy who used to work as a doorman at one of the comedy clubs, like a wannabe comic, and he would also get jobs on these reality shows. And the way it would work, they'd call him up. Hey, we're looking for someone whose brother had an affair with his wife and he just found out. He goes, \"What a coincidence. My brother just had like that would be the thing.\" They go, \"Great. Come on in. We're looking for a guy who came back from Vietnam, very disillusioned, you know, whatever the [ __ ] it is.\" They would, he would just say they would just say that to him and he go, \"Great.\" And they knew it was [ __ ] and he would just show up and act it. They would just give him a r. So you came back from Vietnam and what did you discover there? And he would just start talking. Well, when it's real, it goes bad. They had the one thing where the the guy Jenny Jones that ruined her [ __ ] career completely. The guy guy was in love with. Yeah. They were like they were like, \"Hey, I'll do the show, but it's not going to be a guy, right, who's like into me.\" And they were like, \"No, no, no.\" And then it was it was this now he's friends with two people. a big fat girl and a gay guy. And the big fat girl was sitting out there and he was like, \"Oh [ __ ] okay.\" And they go, \"No, no, it's not her.\" And they bring out the guy and he says, he goes, \"Oh, you lied to me.\" And his face is real like embarrassed. And he killed the gay guy later. And that ruined Jenny Jones career completely. Yeah. You know, Jenny Jones was a comic and she used to do like all girls night. So at the club, like you couldn't even be in the club. So they would do like a show where it would be all girl weight staff, all girl everything. All girl audience. The least funny show ever. The service is slow. The math is wrong. And then she clean as [ __ ]. No security. Latina gang fights in every bathroom. I think it was just a regular club. It's just they just only got female staff to run everything. That's great. You sometimes see there was like an all female comedy festival. Imagine if you try to do an all-male comedy festival. It'd be hilarious. We have it skank fest. Be a good festival. Have you seen that? You girls show up. Did you ever see that there's like I forget there's some shift in some town where their brag is like and this shift is all 100% female police officers. Like, well, now we know the time and place, dude. Let's lose. Yeah. Take over this [ __ ] city, dude. They'll do that with on a flight. I wasn't on it, but I've seen it where it's like, \"Just so you know, today all of the flight attendants and our captain and co- captain are female.\" You're like, \"What? Let me off this [ __ ] flight right now.\" Wasn't that the case in Toronto where the plane flipped upside down? I think that that's the movie Flight with Denzel Washington. No, no, no. They woke you up like, \"Hey, do you know how to She came in hot. She came in hot on the landing and flipped the plane.\" Oh, yeah. When it landed upside down, I did. Yeah. Yeah, bro. Yeah. Yeah. I think that was one of them deals. If I get a female Uber driver, I rebook my Uber. Oh my god. They drive so slow and by like the the laws in Whimo. I did. I've been in Whimo twice cuz I Yeah, dude. An Asian woman driver is the worst. There's a lot of that in New York City sometimes. It's crazy. And they are slow and they do not change lanes and it is brutal to sit there in the back and not yell. I know. And then they're going exactly the speed limits. You can't complain. Yeah. Like please break the law. This is crazy. That guy who's one of the producers of Top Gear in the UK, he got his license revoked cuz he went 24 miles an hour in a 20 m an hour zone. They took his license away for 6 months. Weird. How rough is England? That town needs a Mexican uprising. It sounds like. Sounds like they did an English uprising. 20 is 20. I was just driving from Manchester to London. When you get into London, the speed limit is 20 miles an hour. That is so crazy. It's insane. How many kilometers is that? I don't know. But because the my driver uh had it was in miles per hour, like his uh speedometer and it was 20 miles an hour he was going and it just feels like you're in slow motion. It's insane. Well, do they why do they always use miles per hour? I think they use kilometers, right? No, I think they uses kilome. I thought they use kilometers, but this car, this car specifically had miles per hour on the speedometer. Oh, like that. But you were on the wrong side of the road. Yeah. Is that weird? I a bad driver on the right side of the road. Well, I wasn't driving. I did drive in Jamaica. So, cuz I was an English-owned uh country territory, so uh they're on the opposite side as well. And I rented mopeds when\n\n\nI was in Jamaica. And you get used to it very quickly. Like you think it's going to really turn you around, but like whatever it is, your mind just flips it. And now as soon as I drive into Canada, right away we've been in Canada signs. I'm like, \"Oh no. Oh no. Here we go. We got to go east.\" Yeah. O Nord. How many different countries use inches and miles an hour? Doesn't everybody use kilometers now? Doesn't everybody use the metric? I still think they're wrong. That's crazy. They tried it on us when I was in high school. Really? Yeah. They tried to re They tried to introduce the metric system as if this is going to be the thing that we all accept and everybody's like, \"Nah.\" Yeah. Can't equate it. Not in this country, [ __ ] I don't follow the Dewey decimal system either. Nope. Suck my dick, old people. Whoa. [ __ ] your kilograms.\n\nYeah, it's a weird thing that one country just says, \"Nah, we can't learn it. [ __ ] that.\" I mean, how many countries have it? How many countries have inches? I think it's maybe England. It says uh the UK, USA, and Canada keep miles per hour. Oh, so is that what is England has miles per hour? Oh, no. They have it like it's it's double, but it's their main thing is definitely kilometers for sure. Yeah. Everything else it's uh everything else is kilometers. So it's like six countries that have um kilometer or miles per hour. Well, or inches.\n\nThis is weird that we didn't I I still don't know. I feel like I feel like dick is inches in every You think so? Place my dick is 36 decimeters.\n\n26,000 kilometers.\n\nDo you know guys not good? Do you guys have a vast majority countries use kilometers per hour? Um 9% of the world uses miles per hour. US being the notable example. Interesting. So it's all the UK. I wasn't wrong. When I was in uh England for the fights, they measure people in stone. So they say 10 stone and then I have no idea what that means. I think it's 230 lbs. I think it's Is it 13 pounds each stone? It's a weird old timey [ __ ] measure, but you have to say it.\n\nstones, I think. So, 14 lb. 14 lbs. So, that would be 240 lbs. 10 stone. I think it was actually like like a [ __ ] scale, just a scale with like a person on one side and stones on the other. I think it's what it comes from. I do like England though. It's shitty food, but it's still just a cool like London. You like being the only circumcised person in a room, you piece of [ __ ] So, no. 10 stones 140 lbs, right? You said you said it's 14 pounds per. Yeah. Okay. 20 stones be 240 lbs. So then you'd have to say the the like eight like five stone nine ounces then say the [ __ ] pounds afterwards. It was it's weird. Like why talking about weird things to keep holding on to? Stone. That's a strange one. Do you go and see the places? Any of those weird destinations for UFC? I definitely have. Yeah. Yeah. London's cool. It's interesting. You go into a bar that's a 500y old place. It's weird. Like there's some old [ __ ] in that town. Oh yeah. you know, and you see how New York was like designed after it so much. Yeah. Yeah. London's a cool town. I like I like honestly if I like cities that remind me of New York. So like I love Rome. Rome's like the OG New York. It's [ __ ] really cool. Um how so? I don't think you're wrong. I've never been.\n\nHow's it like New York? It's just It feels like cuz back in the day it was like the most pope you [ __ ] It's like the hub. It's like very fast moving. Yeah. They were they were more advanced than everyone. They were just like, you know, architecturally, technologically, they they were way ahead of their time with everything. That St. Peter's Basilica is bananas. I I think about that all the time. I think about it all the time. Like the amount of work involved in making something that spectacular. The Systeine Chapel is [ __ ] nuts, dude. Michelangelo went blind painting it. Yeah. Like he was on scaffolding and like paint was just dripping into his eye and sort of going mad and [ __ ] Oh god, it's so cool. And the details and he wasn't even a painter, which is the craziest thing. He wasn't like he wasn't that wasn't by trade what he did. He was just a genius and could like emulate like that crazy ass art. He could do anything. His sculptures were insane. Yeah. The [ __ ] art in the Vatican too is nuts. When you're walking through the place like how much money is all this worth? Like this is crazy. It's the biggest art museum in the world. And I'm going again. I brought my son a few years ago on a father-son trip. And he I mean he was he was 8 years old. We we did a 4-hour tour. We could have done an 8-hour tour. It was so cool. It was just ne never ending. Just every room was more awesome than the next. They had the big map room. Did you see that? They had like a map. It was like, you know, 150 ft wide, [ __ ] however many feet tall and it was 99% accurate. And whatever year it was that they made it, it was like I don't know how like hundreds and hundreds of years ago. 99% accurate drawn by hand. Crazy. I can't even begin to tell you how. Like I have no idea how that could possibly be done. Louis swore to me today. He was going to crowbar an art talk. I did. He said in the car, he goes, \"I bet I can get Joe talk art.\" How about their books? I said he's gonna think it's gay and he was like, I bet he doesn't. It's funny that art would be gay. You know, it's when you the books that they have, too. They have a crazy library of like they probably have some books from the Library of Alexandria. They got tucked away in there. Well, apparently the deeper you go, like the more like exotic the [ __ ] is. There's like levels that you can only have access to if you're like a king or a [ __ ] That's why I believe people are capable of hiding UFO information. That's why I believe people are capable because they're people capable of hiding all kinds of [ __ ] But what's you hiding England [ __ ] No one gives a [ __ ] What are they hiding in their salt things for their food? Tastes good. The king's list. Yeah. This is when we had dragons. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The history of dragons been stifled by Jay doesn't travel. He won't go to other countries. I'm trying to get him to do shows like in the UK just I mean they have the internet.\n\nWell, you got to figure New York to LA is a 6 hour flight. New York to Amsterdam is a 7-hour flight. I tell you something. I've done everything everything I did overseas. I did probably or most things I should say probably a little young in comedy and intimidated myself on the situations. Well, it's not cuz you're poor, so you can't go to like a nice nice restaurant or like you I'll tell that when I was in South Africa, I was wealthy, dude. It's their money is garbage.\n\nBut uh but no, but I'm telling you, I've and I've enjoyed some of the places when I've gone to them. It's just like I am such a a regular idiot that I'm just like I'm not going to understand the food and what what am I going to plug my stuff into? Doesn't it explode if it's wrong? Dude, Amsterdam is so when you go through like when you walk through the red light district like the places where you could buy like snacks like you know how many dude it's so funny they have like like hot dogs on like pizza buns. It's so for like dumb Americans to be like no a hot dog on a pizza bun and you [ __ ] just eat this chocolate taco. Choco tacos are great. Choco taco. Choco tacos were [ __ ] badass. I get it, Jay. Why travel? [ __ ] it. I uh Yeah, I follow the Kid Rock credo. I just try to get famous here. Let's just handle it here. This is the best place to be famous if you can get famous. Yeah. Who does it better than Kid Rock? He's got Nobody really figured it out. Also, by gunning down that Miller Light, you know, Bud Light rather, that Bud Light thing. Gun down those cans. Like that was like one of the craziest moments in economy.\n\nLike that [ __ ] the Bud Light stock dropped like a rock. Like that moment when Kid Rock guns down the Bud Light. Kid Rock, maybe though, if we were going to appoint him something, he should make the minister of beer. Like, he should be the person deciding what beer we should have. I'll accept that cuz his friendship with the president is hilarious. It's funny and wacky. There's been no other thing like that ever. You know what I mean? You never found out like, \"Oh, Bill Clinton and Iverson kick it once in a while.\" Like, that never happened. Well, there was um what the [ __ ] name? Oh, Bobby Brown and [ __ ] Joe Biden [ __ ] golf and crush ass together. What the [ __ ] his name that's friends with Kim Jong-un? Rodman. Rodman. Yeah. Dennis Rodman goes over there and hangs with Kim John. It's the best document. Do you ever see that documentary? No. Oh, treat yourself as soon as humanly possible to Dennis Rodman's Big Bang and Pongyang. Oh boy. It starts off as him going over there believing he's doing something diplomatic and then they go, \"All right, so you're going to go home and gather up some players and come here.\" And the documentary uh filmmaker goes on the flight back when they were coming back now to North Korea, he goes, \"Oh, I noticed from the last time that Dennis has started drinking again.\" And he was supposed to be like, \"Stop drinking completely.\" And then the documentary takes off cuz it's just Dennis Robin [ __ ] up in North Korea for two hours. So he first comes in drunkenly, starts bowing everybody. It's not a bowing culture. So that's pretty hilarious. He treats the uh North Koreans like they're dolls who like grab them and make them come sing karaoke and just points at them like while they sing. He just dominates the room and everyone's afraid of him and everyone hates him. Oh no. It's one of the best documentaries. Is there a trailer for a trailer? What a crazy thing to go hang out with a dictator. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, also basketball. Kim Jong-un also does not want much to do with Dennis Robin. What? Like after his meltdown he like he like stiffs him. He like has Dennis Robin meet him at his like chalet and then he's not there. Whoa. And it's just Dennis Robin crying. Is this the trailer? Oh,\n\nwe're here today for Dennis Rodman to make a historic announcement following his recent visit to North Korea. The Ministry of Sports of the DPR Korea invites Mr. I just realize how much influence stylistically you take from Dennis Rodman. Jay, almost the same guy. A lot of people say Mr. Rodman is on a private trip and our views about North Korea have not changed.\n\nYou know, you got the JCs, the Beyonce, stuff like that. None of these people in the world are doing what I'm doing.\n\n[Music]\n\nI am concerned as many Americans are about giving a birthday present to a man who is Wait, pause it for one second. this that do you remember that interview on ESPN? No. So they had him and the players had that agreed to play uh go on there and he loses his mind. Dennis Rob, but in the documentary they show you the whole buildup to that which is uh the guy's meeting without Dennis Robin. They're like Dennis is a little off his rocker right now and America's turning on us. We're going to do this interview with CNN while Dennis is asleep hung over and we'll just do it just us and we'll be able to explain this better that we're just trying to be diplomatic and do something here. And then Dennis Robin wakes up and finds out they're doing that. He just bars on and he just cuts a wrestling promo on this and he's just slobberf filled. It makes no sense. Who just had his uncle executed? I'm going to rise. What the hell you think? I'm standing here. Look at these guys. Look at him.\n\n[Music]\n\nOh, so great.\n\n[Music]\n\nDo you have to let the Koreans win? Um, when you go over there? Oh, it didn't matter. The Koreans did. The game was such nonsense.\n\nLike, at first it was the Americans versus them. They This uh Koreans kept up with them because they're good and they're giving a [ __ ] and trying. Dennis Robin stops playing. He just changes out of his thing and puts on street clothes and goes and hangs out with uh Kim Jong Kim Jong- right away. And then he goes at halftime, he just goes, \"Some people switch jerseys.\" And then he goes, \"So we could play together.\" And he just has them play. He also has the audience uh try to sing along Happy Birthday to Kim Jong-un when he starts the game. And the audience doesn't know what he's singing, so they just start clapping too fast while he's singing. It's It's really It's two fantastic hours of television. I recommend it highly. Wow. I love that kind of just brazen not seeing it what's happening around you. Like everyone's hating him and he's just like I'm killing it. Can't believe how good he's doing. That's great. So he doesn't go over there anymore. No. Well, I don't think so. I'm sure he still drinks though. You stopped drinking. How is protect our parks with no drinking? It was fun. And you're the only one not\n\n\nDrinking there. Yeah. But then at some point, aren't you like wrangling three people who are blackout drunk, but it's okay. I've been blackout drunk. I know what it feels like. It's not bad. It's just for health purposes. I was like, I work out so much and I take care of my body. Like, why am I poisoning it all the time? And I said, let me just take a break. And I just took a break. And I was like, God, why do I need it? I was like, what am I doing? Like, everybody's like, you want a drink? Yeah, let's have a drink. But sometimes you're just like, what? It's just like a force of habit, you know? Have a drink every time I do a set, have a whiskey, have a shot before I go on stage. And you feel like you're doing something. You feel bored when everyone else is drinking, but it's really no like I have way more energy when I'm not drinking. I could stay up and like be present. Like I want to I want to be in bed by 11:00 if I'm drinking or smoking weed. Dude, I've had three months off and I haven't had one bad day. So, I haven't had one day physically where I feel like [ __ ]. That has to be it. Well, the other side is your metabolism. When I stopped drinking, I got really like just in incredible shape. Um, and as you're getting older, like even just like whatever it does to like my metabolism, and everybody is different. Um, but it was like a huge difference in terms of how I felt in the gym, what how much I could run, how much I could lift. Um, it's fun. It's fun poison. Yeah, it's fun.\n\nMy doctor said those exact words. He was like, he was like, \"You're poisoning yourself.\" He was like, \"It's up to you. If you want to poison yourself a little bit, that's fine. Or a lot, you know, that's okay, too.\" But that guy sounds fun. Yeah. They were trying to say for a while that like My doctor's not doctor feel good. Remember they were trying to say for a while that one drink a night is probably good for you. Oh, like a glass of red wine. It's good for your heart. You know what the problem with that is? Aura rings. If you have an aura ring, you wear one of those things and then you have it one drink. You'll notice a difference in your sleep. Significant. It's real. It's measurable. I try not to track anything that's going to be bad news. Yeah. They're like, \"Hey, you should get a sleep study.\" He goes, \"Why to know for a fact that I die 27 times a night?\" Yeah. Isn't there like things you could do where you see a doctor and they're going to like be able to essentially predict within a couple years of when you're actually going to die? That's the Joe Rogan doctors probably. I want to know, Joe, who you send Bert to where they come and they put him in that machine like Luke Skywalker on Hoth and they come out and they're like, \"If you eat bean, if you never eat beans again, you'll live to 105.\" Bert is going to need more than that. Every time I see him, he looks more like a grape. Like, settle down, boy. He's uh capable of doing it on his own, though. Bert has incredible willpower. Like, Bert wants to lose a lot of weight. He just drinks so much. It's part of his thing, you know? So, I feel like he feels like I shouldn't put words in his mouth, but he was like, \"Am I Bert Crusher?\" If I'm not getting [ __ ] up and having fun with the fans like that, like if he does a show and he doesn't take his shirt off, people will boo.\n\nYeah, but he could pay to see tits. I think he wants to take his shirt off and they want it to come off. 100%. I do, too. I told I run to the balcony when he's about to take his shirt off. There's a big cheer, the pop. When he takes his shirt off, everybody goes crazy. It's fun. When I did uh Bert's podcast last time, I was like, \"Stop let everybody get in your head about like all these complaints are about Bert being the same person that we all are and also who he is.\" But it's like now it's all of a sudden like, you know, he worries about that [ __ ]. And I'm like, Bert, people want you to take your shirt off and they want to hear your stories about your family. You're letting people uh go like, \"Well, you don't do it like this person.\" It's like, well, you don't tell jokes like Mark Norman. You know, that's not what your thing is. So, it's not a thing to worry about. He reads the comments. That's the problem. You read the comments, he'll [ __ ] with your head. No matter how mentally strong you are, if you're reading a bunch of opinions about you, it'll [ __ ] with your head. Yeah. And it's it's it's just like the same people who go on to Yelp and write reviews. It's just people that want to complain. So, when you go on to social media, it's just like you get it feels like like I have a pretty decent fan base. Like Legion of Skanks, we have a really like healthy fan base. And then there's like 30 dudes. Not healthy. No, not physically healthy, but there's like 30 dudes who hate me and want my son to die. And if you go on to Twitter, I'll just see that. And it does like [ __ ] with you. It's not good. Yeah. It's all 30 of his followers, you know. Well, there's a lot of crazy people out there and there's also a lot of kids that just want to get a rise out of you. You know, there's a lot of things going on. There's a lot of people that want to [ __ ] with your head, but it's almost all unhappy people. Unfortunately, I just learned very quickly though, like the ones that I have responded to, even when I respond like my thing was always to respond kind of funny. I'm not getting into fights. Yeah. Or so be someone write like a two paragraphs about how terrible I am and I would be like, you know, come on Jimbo, you don't mean it. And then how much they write. I mean without fail almost 100% of the time they're like, \"Dude, just being a piece of [ __ ] man. I had a crappy day. Love you, dude. Listen every day to meet them in real life.\" Sometimes you'll see there's one guy who tweets at me almost every day where he says, \"Luis J. Gomez has lip fillers.\" And he's trying to get this to be a thing to catch on. Um and then like like every day he's trolling me and I'm like this [ __ ] guy. And like for maybe two years, Luis J. has lip fillers. He'll respond to everything. Other people tweet at me. is like, \"Just so you know, you're you're talking to somebody who has lip fillers, and I don't have lip fillers. I have beautiful Puerto Rican lips.\" This guy showed up at a show. You had a little work, dude. He showed up at a show in um Lipers are wild for a dude. That's wild. He showed up at a show in Raleigh, North Carolina with a t-shirt that said Luis J. Gomez has lip fillers. And then I was like, I should bite your [ __ ] nose off your face. What are you doing? But he's just like, \"Oh, no. I'm a fan.\" Like, it's hilarious. He's just being silly. He's just being silly every day. Being silly. Yeah. Yeah. That's part of the fun of being a fan. Yeah. you know. No, rise out of you. It worked. I know. So, I steer He got you. He's in the front row. He got you. He got you. I steer clear of the comment just cuz of that. Yeah. It's like I don't know. I'd rather just meet people and if they show up, I guess they're so sweet in person cuz Skank Fest is like half of them are like people that were on Reddit and trolling. You go to Skankfest and it is just thousands of people that are like just just love. Like they really skank fest particularly. It's like you know they say how many times in your life have you walked by a murderer? It's like how many times does Skankfest do? I walk by, take a picture, and shake hands with somebody who's like, \"Dude, you used to be good, but you suck dick at comedy now.\" All right. You're always gonna get guys like that. There was one guy who was a fan of ours in the old school when we were at the Creek and Cave back in New York. There's a dude who was he wore black glasses, long black hair, and he was at every episode. He ended up murdering his mother. Oh, Jesus Christ. Murdering his mother becoming great friends with Doug Stanhope.\n\nLike his jail pen pal with Sanh Hope. Whoa. It was pretty funny. He uh when he got out he's out he like lives in like a halfway house type thing now cuz it was a mental issue that he did that which is clearly if you kill your mom well you know she might have been a [ __ ] she'd have to do something really bad if you kill your mom I feel like I don't care you obviously have mental issues like yeah he was like but he had that when he called us he described it was like it was like he thought she was like a demon that he had to stop before she got out in the world like he went he went crazy but I still feel like you should lock that guy up you guys don't pay attention to the BJ Penn stuff he's he's like losing it, right? PJ Pen claims that his family are imposters, that someone is uh kidnapped his family and replaced them. Oh, yeah. That's a very Isn't it funny when they hit the uh with mania and manic [ __ ] like that and uh bipolar with those kind of things? Like they really like they're textbook that if you look it up cuz I've looked it up before. We look it up. It's texting one sentence at a time. A rel a newfound thing in like religion and like being serious about it all of a sudden. Like it's always been that way. And weird. And they always have those things. That's one of them too. Like everyone's everyone's fake, right? Everyone in my life has been replaced with somebody else. They called something particularly. Some of them think they have a chip in their head and people are talking to them. Mhm. Yeah. There's a lot of that. A lot of that is they have a chip in their head. Well, this guy who killed his mom and Doug Stino became friends with Doug was doing a Zoom skanks one time episode with us and he had that guy call in and uh you know we were asking him kind of about what happened and he was you know he gave a very compelling story and we were saying goodbye to him. He goes uh he goes do you remember this? He goes, \"I just want to say, uh, you know, when I was going through all that horrible stuff and the last several years that have been so difficult and terrible and my family hating me and but I still always, man, I listen to you guys and laugh and I just want to say that I love you guys and I was like, well, I think I think I speak for the group and I say because we all are aware of what you'll do if you feel someone is a problem.\" So, yeah. Or a demon. Yeah. Or possibly a demon. Yeah. See, I'm The point is we have some great fans. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody wants part of their\n\nYou guys are doing something really fun. You're getting all the misfits together, you know, and you're you're celebrating comedy. It's It's like a real comedy, like a comic's festival. Like the comics look forward to it. Everybody loves it. Everybody talks so highly of it, you know, and everybody says the vibe is so fun because they they just go there to see like, you know, people were real upset when Louis C.K. started to come back into the public eye. Yeah. But uh one of my favorite moments is when he went up at Skankfest. They didn't know he was going to be there. That was the first time he performed in America after he got cancelled. It was awesome. It was awesome. And it was it was I mean it was wild. And what's beautiful about the fans, they're educated comedy fans. So we didn't even have to tell them to not pull out their cell phones. Not a single person took video. Not a single person like this did cuz I watched the video. No. I took that video of Justin Silver announcing ladies and gentlemen, you know, special guest. And I didn't take any of his set. It was just him walking on a stage standing ovation. It made TMZ. It was [ __ ] really cool. I mean, I was I was I was a pig and [ __ ] I went outside. I got emotional. I was like, that was [ __ ] so cool. That's cool. What was really neat about what's funny about that moment was I was with Soder, Dan Soder, and I was like, uh I was like, \"You want to come outside? I'm going to smoke a joint outside.\" He goes, \"Yeah, sure.\" And as we were just walking through that room, I wasn't even thinking about it. They go He goes, \"Oh, wait.\" You know, he goes, \"We should watch Louis come on real quick.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, yeah, sure.\" Like I didn't overthink of the moment you were about to watch was so crazy. It was really It was really cool. Like uh that was that was like one of the coolest moments at the festival. That and then the tough crowd. We did a tough crowd reunion at Skankfest in Brooklyn a few years ago and just having everybody from Tough Crowd get together and that's awesome. Yeah. Colin, you know, being at the head\n\n\nOf it. That was awesome. That was one of the best shows ever. He should just make it a podcast. It would be a huge podcast. 100%. I wonder if he has the name. If he owns the name, but then he should definitely do it. I think he does. I think he just doesn't want to. I think well it might be something that someone needs to offer it to him and put it together, you know, like if someone like it could be something if you said it he'd be like, \"I never even thought of that until this moment.\" A lot of people have a lot. He's been approached with it. He was great at the club. He was at the club a couple weeks ago. He's awesome, awesome. He was great. All the comics that worked there, they all like lined up to watch him, you know? I mean, he's a real like he's just such a pro. Also, so far material is so interesting. He's such an interesting guy. Well, he does the one-man shows are fantastic. When I the last time I did Tough Crowd, uh, he warmed up the crowd and so he's doing standup in front of the crowd and he was murdering. I'm like, \"This is way better than even Tough Crowd.\" Like he's one of the most underrated guys of all time. Yeah. You know, like all us comics know how funny he is. He's like a real comic's comic and every every he's like in the top three for it's like a it's like a tell like he's there. It's always like top three for every comedian. It was also though that place was like the shark tank though for something when they got Oh yeah, that fan. I never felt bad for somebody more in my life when they had him on there. And the only segment that was uh produced of Tough Crowd, you remember, was the last one you had to write and give them like the whatever your little rant was going to be about the final topic. I did it once. About that uh final topic. That was the only like homework you had to do at all. And um that fan was clearly going to do something about like his mother and do the voice or something. M and Patrice right before he like was about to do his part, his fourth segment thing. He goes, \"Hey, let's see if you can do two minutes without talking doing your mom accent.\" Oh. And then and then Voss and all those guys just like started pouncing on him. And then he just had to go like, \"Hey, you guys.\" So my mother called me like, \"Oh, oh, he had to do it still.\" That's how we prepared.\nOo man, that was but it was like an like an OG podcast. Before podcasting was podcasting, like just a bunch of comics sitting around just barking at each other arguing. So fun. It was fun. Way ahead of its time. But then again like Regis and Kathy Lee was a podcast technically too. Technically if you really think about it. Yeah. The View, all these shows. I think Opie and Anthony was the big start of it all. Yeah, for sure. That was what started it off for me cuz that was the first time I was ever on a show where it was no structure. It was just comics. Like we all could be on Opie and Anthony. We'd be having this exact same conversation except Norton and Kumia and Opie would be here. Same conversation.\nYeah. You know, it was just they let you go. I was more of a Howard Stern guy, you know, and I know so were you as well, but without Opie and Anthony, like shows like Legion of Skanks wouldn't exist. Like that's the truth. Like we also there's a lot of fans that are just like just these 50-year-old truckers that are just like, \"We need something.\" And now our generation was having a much harder time. Like it wasn't like back in the day when Stern was Howard Stern was bringing on comics, all the comics cuz that was like his crew he was trying to build up. Like we were past that. So we had no there was no like show that was like that for anybody which except for Opie and Anthony. I was Ron and Fez. You remember Ron and Fez show? That's the show that kind of like took me in that I uh jived with best. Yeah. That was a lot of fun. Ron Bennington's great. He's the best. So funny. Yeah. There's like, you know, there's a whole you could track like like ancient man, you know, like prehistoric. You could track podcasts to where it is. Without a doubt. How about Mark Maron just quitting? I know. Crazy. He's done. He's hanging it up. Not fun anymore. The uh Yeah, but like Opie and Anthony, what they did different than Stern was they put comics on. There was a few comics that would come on Stern. They would interview like they were mega stars. Obie and Anthony figured out they could put three or four comics in a room and create like a beautiful chaos and it was just going to be people bouncing off each other. You'd create these moments that nobody knew was going to happen. Really cool. Stern did not believe in that. You want a cigar? I'll take a cigar. Hell yeah, dude. That's what I'm talking about. I love a good cigar.\nYeah, Stern's thing now is for comics. Oh, Stern sucks now. Now it has to be. I know. It's really It's funny like I was one of the last people to check out. Yeah, you like to turn way too late. I still listen, I still arbitrarily just go to it and I think he's the best that ever did it. I think he I give him all the kudos in the world. Without him, there would be nothing. None of it. I give him all the kudos in the world. It's just I think the like I don't think I think his last like phase here might be like I might be weirdly too young for it. Like possibly. Thank you. Like the interviews don't really ones. These are good. These are good. The interviews don't really strike me anymore. I really don't. He's not going to get to anything that I care about with Sarah Jessica Parker. It's just not going to get He's Yeah, I remember back in the day he made the guy one of those guys who died from LFO. Remember that that song from the '9s? Uh what is it? I like Chinese food makes me sick. Girls of Summer. I don't know what that is. You're a real cigar guy. Look at you. You know how to burn before you It's a one hit. It's a one hit wonder. I don't remember. Lfo. They were like around the same time as all the boy bands and they got uh pretty popular and he made one of those guys so interesting. You got him to talk about Jennifer Love Huitt and then her dumping him and the way he found out he was dumped like she gave him a ring that was like a promise ring from her to him and then he saw her and like a tabloid walking with another guy and the guy had the same exact ring. That's just her ring she gives out. She's a wild girl. Yeah. Giving out rings to dudes. I know. She aged like a goddamn plum though. She looks like Oh no. She looks like now. I feel bad say this is a big too big of a platform to be like trashing a girl for not being pretty anymore. It's up. Back off of that. This is the way to do it. I mean better if you don't say it. Hillary Clinton. No. I mean no.\nPamela Anderson. I mean god damn it. Did she fall off? She was the hottest woman wearing makeup. She put it back on again. It didn't help a lot. But I will say no. She was Pamela Anderson. First of all, the documentary about her they did on Netflix documentaries. Jay loves a documentary. Love them. Uh the one they did about her. He won't read a book, but he'll watch a documentary all day long. Books. Who's got time for books? Um but the thing about her made me like her. The one about Anna Nicole Smith made me realize what a piece of she was. I mean, terrible person it seemed like. Uh and then Pam Anderson made me kind of like fall in love with her again where I'm like, this is a she really is just like a dummy who just believes in love. Yeah. She's just like a sucker. No, she had she had a couple moments where she talked about um like during the Me Too movement, she was like, \"Look,\" she was like, \"I got invited to every hotel room by every director in Hollywood.\" She was like, \"I didn't go because I knew what the they wanted.\" And she just kind of had a very real opinion on that whole sort of movement and what was going on. It's like, you know what's happening if you go to a hotel room with some powerful guy? Like, you know, you have to take a certain amount of, you know, accountability yourself. And she had a very real take on it, which I kind of respected. Well, Hollywood had a long history doing that. Tarantino was telling me about this old school director that had a bedroom in his office and his name was Quinton Tarantino.\nHis name was Tint Quarantino.\nDude, he We talked about that, right? Where he he uh in Desperado is it? Or Dust Dust Dawn where he's like that's Dave always. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, I'm going to uh I'm going to have Salahek shove her foot in somebody's mouth. You know what? I think it'll be me. I'll take that. Hilarious. I'm not going to put George Clooney through the sweet sensation of sucking Salah's beautiful foot. Oh god, she was hot in that scene. He played such a good serial killer in that movie. That was great. I just watched it like two weeks ago again. He was such a good psycho. I prefer Black Dust till Dawn called Sinners. I don't think Dustin had enough of enough social commentary. I thought Sinners was great. People hate him. I didn't see it. I thought it was really good. People try to politicize everything. I'm like, it's just a fun vampire movie. Who cares? Yeah. You don't like a good vampire movie? Is it I love a good vampire movie kind of. Yeah. They were saying it's like an attack on white culture. The annoyance of the first the first vampires were like white and they were like feasting on black people and uh which you know black people would be more delicious. But you very rarely other than Blade. You very rarely get a black vampire. Yeah. Sweeter the juice. You know what I'm saying? It's like Oh, you remember Blackula?\nIt had to be a comedy. It was No, it was a movie. No, but it's a it's like a black exploitation, right? Kind of. But supposed to be ridiculous. I think it was a horror movie. I think it was a legit horror movie. Black vampire. Do you know Blackula? Yeah, there it is. Blackula. I found this out from that Pee-Wee Herman documentary. Uh, Blackula was the mailman on Peewee's Playhouse. Oh, no. What a wack. Yeah. Really? Isn't that weird? Wow. Phil Hartman was on Peewee's Playhouse. Died hating him. What? Phil Hartman did Peewee Herman when he died. No. Still. Yeah. What makes you say that? That's a thing in the documentary. Phil Hartman hated Phil Hman did an interview with Howard Stern. and Howard Stern asked him about that and he was like, \"Yeah, we don't speak anymore.\" And Oh, wow. He thought he didn't get enough credit, I think, for uh Peewee's Big Adventure and Oh, that's unfortunate. Yeah, that's weird cuz Phil was Peewee Herman was a real queen, but very interesting. Easy to get along with. Like Phil was ask his wife.\nHe was easy for me. I got along with him great. I love Andy Dick there was the problem. He was fun, man. He was just too wild, you know. But I did so many scenes with that dude where we had to do him like three or four times because I couldn't stop laughing. I just couldn't stop breaking character. He was more just like sad what he's going through now. Everything's Yeah. It's not good. But he also just gets like he's one of those guys he's like letting himself get used by people I assume for drugs or something, but I mean like I don't know cuz he ends up on these like weird pods where it's like he's sleeping at some guy's house or something weird. It's not good. Yeah. He's out of it. And he was right there on the precipice with jury duty. Paulie Shor's vehicle jury duty, right? He did other stuff too, man. He did that that war movie. What was the war movie they did? Oh, in the army now. That's right. Yeah, he was in that. I think that's the one he did. I don't know if he he may have done another one or two of them. They may have been trying to Farley Spade them. Farley spade them together. He's a funny dude though. Do you have hopes for Happy Gilmore, too? Could it possibly be good? Yeah. Adam Sandler still makes good stuff. He still makes good stuff. Yeah, he does. Those Netflix ones were good. Like they were funny. They're pretty good. You like Huie Halloween or something, man. They're funny. They're pretty good. If you you like Adam Sandler, I love Adam Sandler movies. I love silly movies. Like I love the one when he played his own sister. What was that one? Jack and Jill. Jack and Jill's hilarious. And Aluccino's in love with her and she's a brute. It's It's funny. Honestly, on the rules, he's a great actor. And I mean, Happy Gilmore was so great, but I almost feel like there's no way this segment's gonna be good. They'll figure it out. I think they're going to try to do too many throwback moments. This what was a movie they they kind of did that with recently. uh like this coming to America part two. Yeah. Like they there's like that was terrible. That was actually ter\n\n\nand Coming to America I grew up on.\nFirst of all, they made it PG-13. The original Coming to America was rated R. They made it a musical. They put music numbers in it. It was bad. Um, but I have I look I I will I thought Beetle Juice people loved. I didn't like that. Same thing. I thought it was like Yeah, you can't capture that first one. I thought Beetlejuice was pretty good. The new one. I thought it was pretty good. Yeah, I liked it. It wasn't as good as the first one, but it's pretty good. I loved it. The Soul Train when they got on the Soul Train. It was all dead like resurrected black people dressed in like 1970s outfits dancing. Have you seen it? I saw I kept on falling asleep. If I keep on turning it on and falling asleep 20 minutes into it. Well, it's it's good, man. It's it's pretty solid. I mean, it is one of those Tim Burton movies. Just like a fun, weird movie, you know? I love the first one, man. I didn't know Tim Burton made the first Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. Did he really? First Tim Burton movie. Yeah. Oh, that makes sense. Was Large Marge. I forgot to tell him. Large Marge. That looked like the girl we brought to the UFC event. You remember? If they would call her that, we still would have kept our heads down. Large. She is large. bro. Peewee's Playhouse was so fun. or Peewee's Big Adventure rather was so fun. Peeweee's Playhouse was trippy. I didn't even know that. That's how like weird. Like PeeWee's Playoffs was meant to be like one of these bikes was for sale recently auction. I thought How much did it go for? Well, guess I'll let you guess. $100,000. It went for more than that. $500,000. It was $135,000. Wow. There's 14 bikes and it was one of them that was supposed to It had no seat on it. It was a fun movie, man. I went to see that with a girl I was dating in high school and we we were like the only people in the movie theater. It was like one of them lucky moments. We were just howling, howling, laughing.\nFirst was well, the whole thing was always to have like nods for adults in it. A kids movie to it was totally like an anybody's movie. It wasn't just like a kids movie. It was an anybody movie. Peewee was a little off. I was being a kid watching it being like, \"What's the deal here?\" Big Top Peewee all. It was just always a little bit weird. Peewee was that was his he tried to do it himself and that's why that did terribly. Oh, really? Cuz again, there's jokes there no one gets. I forgot this. I saw it once when it first came out. Never saw again. He's got a make out scene with somebody that just goes on for like five straight. They just never stop having them make out and just keeps panning further and further backwards like five in the middle of the movie. Five minutes like hardcore making out with the chick.\nI mean, when I was older, I think I would have gotten cuz he had such like he said a lot of Andy Warhol inspired stuff and reference. There was an episode of Peewee's Big Adventure or Peewee's Playhouse where he said 2 minutes he just put dog food in a bowl and it was just like ASMR, a close-up of a dog just eating the food for like two straight minutes, which I would have weirded me out when I was a kid. Yeah, for sure. It was a lot of just it was it whatever it was, it was just a little bit off. Um he got rolled up in one of the most cases ever. Oh, he got caught jerking off. He got caught jerking off in a gay movie theater where you're supposed to do. That didn't ruin him the way uh he thought like that. In fact, I thought this was interesting when he did his first comeback was that Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie and uh he made he asked him to make his character look like his mug shot. That's why he looks like that. That's funny. He said it made him look like Charles Manson. Like a tough Did you watch it, Jamie? No, I saw clips of it. I was really into I mean, didn't it get his show cancelled? Like No, show was already done. Okay. Show was already done. I But he was he was out for a while. Then he was in Blow. He was in that. No, he came back. He had a he had a career for real. But after that, what took him down was cuz I thought you were saying got caught up in the biggest He was caught up in that sweep that got Jeffrey Jones. What's that? The the That's the That was the principal from uh Ferris Buer. That guy got nailed with actual pornography. Oh. And he and Peewee Herman was friends with him. So they went and searched Peewee's house. And what they found? He's a collector. He's like a crazy collector. Just found a big couch that can talk. Yeah. Bunch of naked kids inside of it. No, you understand. I don't him. It eats them. Um, no. He had like erotica from like the 70s in collections that was like and everyone was above age, but it just like it was considered obscene material. Oh, no. When they went to his house, where was he living? California, I believe. And obscene erotica. He got nailed with obscene material charges, but he was lumped in with like pedophilia. The charge here is a little worse than that. What is it? pleaded no contest in LA court to charges of hiring a 14-year-old boy to pose for photographs. To pose for photographs. They leave that out of the documentary. I feel like they didn't put that in the documentary. Look at Big Jay defending an actual pedophile. I'm just saying he was a good guy. You got to stay documentary.\nOh man, child porn was not part of the deal. Joe, the first time we did your podcast when you showed us all your cool toys in your LA studio, I would have sucked your dick to do one of those things. Which toys? your like your your uh compound bow. I've told I've told this story so many times on podcast. This is the first time we came here and it's all it ends so great cuz uh me, David, and Luis all came in in LA and you took us first and you go check this out and you grabbed compound bow and you had the laser sight and you could shoot it all the way across the full UFC gym you had. It looks so cool. We were all like just warming our hands up like we can't wait till we can do this. Then you put the bow down as I was reaching forward I thought. And then you went over, you go, \"There's the pool table.\" You broke a rack and sunk a few. Like, cool. Then you open the door and you're like, \"Here's where I freeze myself. Here's where I thaw myself out.\" We're like, \"Wow.\" And then you go, \"And here's my prize uh possession.\" And you had the They do it for golf and stuff, too. Like the Kevlar screen hunting. Yeah. And you had the flat tip, but I go, \"He probably wants us to do this one because it's the flat tips. No one's going to get hurt.\" And then you wailed two elk. And then you go, \"Let's go podcast, boys.\" And I was like, he just showed us all his toys and was like, don't touch them. The problem with those toys is I can't teach you that quickly to I understand. We're going to embarrass ourselves. We would have embarrassed ourselves big, but then we always say like how much Dave Smith came on like talks with you after that individually. Me, we were me and Luis like why doesn't Joe embrace us the way he embraces Dave? And then someone brought up the p the first picture we ever took here. It's so funny. It's the werewolf. I am standing behind the werewolf like I'm it. Louis Lewis is yeah acting like he's getting sucked off by the bear and Dave is just leaning in touching it going I'm like oh you know what Dave had respect for you and your belongings. We're like oh that's hilarious. The difference between us and Dave I wonder why Dave keeps going back. Dave is his hand on the head gently. Yeah. Is Dave in the Rogan sphere? We're trying to figure out how we get in the Rogan sphere. My ochre fear is Look, first of all, Shane doesn't Shane doesn't need the Rogan sphere anymore. Let's just move Shane out. Move Big Jay into that position. Doesn't require the Ari's moving to Thailand or something. He's gone. I'm ready. I'm a wacky guy. I'll shave half my head. Ari's going to do a stint over there and bail. I'm going to talk to him. I'll call him up every day. that place. Call him up. Plant it in his head. I think we got Diaz coming here. Oh, it's Austin. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, he's we talked about it this weekend. I saw him in Jersey for the fights.\nSo, he's back in the sphere. Yeah. Plenty of room for you guys. You're in the sphere right now. You're on the show. Every time the Rogan sphere gets talked about, we never get thing. When Cat Williams said six unfunny comics, we knew it wasn't us. I knew it wasn't us. I would have been happy to be one of the six unfunny comics. Listen, cat probably has a point. But what I was trying on. I'm like, bro, I love you. He's so funny. I couldn't wait to have him on right away. I'm like, I reached out to him right away. I go, that's not true. I just haven't reached out to you because I didn't know if you wanted to do it. Sure. Like, I didn't know he wanted to do it. If he want If I thought he wanted to do it, I would have had him on a long time ago. I He might be one of my favorite like standups to watch a special of cuz I have a hard time like laughing at like on TV specials. Pimp Chronicles. Dude, he's so funny, dude. I'm not going to lie. I need subtitles for it, but I I I genuinely don't know what he's saying, but I know Cat Williams is very, very funny. Pimp Chronicles is a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece. He's so good.\nThere's something about him when he's cooking too. When he's cooking, when he's like really on fire, it's different than everybody else. He's sweating and then, you know, he's his hair is throwing back and just the tone of his voice and the way he repeats punchlines. It's like that guy gets cooking, man. He gets cooking. Like you watch the crowd, they're just falling out. He does really long sets, too, right? He does like an hour and a half. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's a beast. He's a beast. He's a wild boy. At least I've done knows how to drive, too. I put him on the driving simulator. He killed it. Oh, I always see him track on Worldstar Hip Hop. He beats like pro athletes in races and all the time. I believe it. It's very weird. Yeah. And he talks about And he still What's funny is he also dresses though like the old black guy who comes to play basketball. So, it looks like he's not going to be that good. And then he's like fast as Beat up a teenager. Do you remember that? It's the funniest thing in the world. He goes, \"Watch this. This is him at a racing simulator.\" By the way, he's doing it one hand. Give me some volume. Get in there. Get in there. There you are. There he is. That's where you have to fight that competition off that corn. How accurate is the simulator? Pretty good. It's got gravity. It It turns you side to side. It has crazy noises. It feels like you're really driving.\nYeah. And how do we do it like this? Cuz we do this in real life.\nIf he was driving Uber, he'd be making a personal phone call right now.\nSo he can drive.\nHe looks terrified. No, he looks like he's on it, man. That steering wheel, that steering wheel break your wrist if you're holding. Yeah, it's hard. It's not a game. No, it the steering wheel reacts as if your tires would react on at high speeds on a racetrack. Do you guys ever do a racetrack? You ever drive in a racrack? No, I can't I can't drive 35 miles an hour on a regular road. I do believe in full I do believe in full track. When I did Bert's Tour, one of the things we performed at a racetrack and they had the pace car. It was like a convertible and they took us all for like a couple loops like individually. One time they wanted us to film it and mine was so boring because I was like smiling. It was exhilarating the whole time but they were like you know Bert's giving them and people are going like no no no no like the corners are coming and they were like you didn't freak out at all. I go I just had blind trust they're not going to kill us like right like are they going to put us in real like are we going to start cartwheeling down the road here? This I assume they're not going to do anything they don't know how to do perfectly. This is why Bert's famous because Bert's fun and he reacts big and you just sat there like I was just like this was neat. Nobody wants to watch that. I know. I should watch you screaming and yelling and crying about your daughter. Just be yourself. My daughter. Don't worry about what people want. Yeah, I can't scream at that. I gave it remember when the first time you guys did my nails on the show\n\n\nI freaked out about touching my cuticles. And now he gets them done. Now he gets them done. No, he gets his nails painted by an Asian lady every week. No, you have to once it's get done every other week. Luis, I'm not a diva. Is that a thing you think you feel connected to? Like you have to keep doing that now? Bert Kreischer take your shirt off thing. Oh, no, no, no, not like that. No, it's more like connecter. No, it's a gayer thing. No, it's connected to uh I bit my nails forever. Got my teeth fixed. Can't bite my nails anymore. They grew in raggedy. I tried to take care of them myself and was just terrible at it. They got my nails on the show in time because I a bit because he he if you if you just did this to Big Jay, look, if you show him you're pulling your cuticle back, he'll freak out for some reason. It's a weird thing. So, we had an Asian lady come in and we warned her. We were like, \"Listen, the type of show, the jokes we're going to make.\" She was so cool. This like little She barely spoke any English, but she was such a fun time and she did his nails on the show and he screamed like a girl the whole time cuz she didn't scream. It was more like that like pull away like I was I I did not enjoy it. Yeah. And then uh it became a thing where every week after that he came in with a new color nails every other week. But it's the uh I keep saying every week. I'm not a gay man. I uh\nNo, but once they were done then Yeah. Once you can't really undo it. I don't know what to do now. I can't take care of them that good myself. I can't make them look like that. Just go get it done. Who gives a [ __ ] Yeah. If that's what you like. Yeah. Everybody's got their own quirks. Luis J. Gomez, leave them alone. Jesus. Yeah. Luis, you chose to have nipple rings that connect. I have one or had one nipple ring. I can't believe you actually had one. I was kidding. Did they connect like Xerxes? No. No. I had a nipple ring. I had a lip ring. I like ring. Isn't the funniest thing you had all those things when your like now you my body sucked. Yeah. Yeah. You never had a nipple ring. You never had a nipple ring. You had your tit. You look sexy in tank tops. I was so bad, dude. Just a fat kid with a nipple ring for How did you get it done? I don't know. I just went to I like tattoos and piercings and [ __ ] I was young. I was surprised though. I kept uh from being fat my whole life also. I kept my tattoos always to arms for the most. I never did ones that I would have to take my shirt off for people to see. Yeah. I wouldn't do a stomach tattoo. No, but you had like here. I have my chest tattooest. On my own. I got it when my mom died. It says on my own. On my own. I know. Isn't that ironic for a guy who owns a company and is has a thousand friends and collaborates with people and everything he does? He's on his own. Well, he says on this side, uh coachel writer.\nYou figured out early on though that the best way to not get pulled off of [ __ ] is to have your own network though.\nYeah. Like Kumia did that. You guys did that. Yeah. Yeah. That's such funny is for we were going like for a few years it would almost seem like pointless cuz Patreon got so big. Then with censorship with YouTube and all these other platforms now there's never been a better time for it. Like we have an uncensored version of the show and adree version of the show. We can say anything we want. YouTube hunts us every time we get close to that plaque. We've had our four YouTube channels taken down in the 90 in the 90s something thousands of subscribers because Jesus Christ they just start reviewing it then they're like no no way. What is the kind what gets pulled? What's it about? Most of the time it's actually our [ __ ] dumb producers leaving in like nudity and [ __ ] like that. Um YouTube relaxes moderation rules to allow more controversial content. That's like just today though. Oh this is today. Freedom of expression value may outweigh harm risk. That's great.\nfor YouTube. [ __ ] It is changing a little bit, which is good. The pendulum swings, right? Podcast I was listen the other day and I was like, \"How is this?\" Cory's wild. He's so funny. All the words. All the words you're not allowed to say. Like, so we bleep out like all the no no words, right? And this includes discussions of elections, ideologies, movements, race, gender, sexuality, abortion, immigration, and censorship. Beautiful. We're back.\nNot remove anything considered to be in the public interest. Oh, dude. Well, abortion, too. So, we could do that abortion now on the air. Remember that live abortion. We've been putting that bit off for years. That would be a great bit. Early term. Everything that you can discuss is in the public interest, though. That's, you know, I'm glad they changed it to that. That's a great way it like like jokes like specifically like I got I got my um on Instagram right now. They I can't um go live or advertise on Instagram for a year because I was talking about a bit that I did on my first special on Dan Soder's podcast um about how I would get free cocaine in Mexico. I went up the beach and like I would get samples of cocaine. I told the story about actually doing it and they flagged it and said we were promoting like uh the sales of drugs and I'm [ __ ] [ __ ] for a year now. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's like literally a joke. I'm just You did put up the number of the dealer, though. You put up the dealer's number? No. No. No. But that's what I did. I would I would go up and down the beach and I'd get a free sample of cocaine. I go to the next guy, get another free sample of cocaine, go to the next guy, and I just did that all night until they caught on. There were Well, you were the leader of the cartel. Yeah, they can get you for Rico charges now. Yeah, that was uh the Cabo Comedy Festival. The shittiest comedy festival ever like a decade ago. Cabo Comedy Festival. And at the end of the night, I [ __ ] like a 70-year-old woman.\nShe was gross. Luis still hotter than the girl we brought to the UFC in Philly. You was she? No. You've hooked up with a couple of hilarious ones. Old ladies. Yeah. Just like Oh [ __ ] I think on ship rocks one year you hooked up with a [ __ ] doozy. Oh yeah. She had like a really thick smoker's voice.\nIt's like come to my cabin. Jesus.\nYou're a little bit locked in on a cruise. Especially a heavy metal cruise. Heavy metal from the '9s. There's no Hot Chicks on those cruise cruise. Yeah, we did a thing. I've done it a bunch. Dude, I was watching uh this documentary today on the Black Sea where all those cargo ships wind up sinking. Have you ever seen ships going across the Black Sea? It's apparently like the most dangerous part of the ocean to cross. For Luis, where's the Black Sea?\nCuz I see his eyes are crossing. I think it's uh across the top of the UK. I'm not exactly sure, but I watched this documentary about watching these [ __ ] cargo ships get nailed by these monster waves. And you I'm like imagine being on a [ __ ] cruise ship and some [ __ ] like that. Oh my god, it's terrifying.\nRenegade wave goes sideways. So where's it? That's the Black Sea. So where's that at? Turkey. Turkey. Yeah. Between Turkey. See if you can find some videos of cargo ships getting [ __ ] up on the Black Sea. It's crazy. It's scary. The ocean's scary in general. Terrible. The ocean is I've been surfing before and I'm just I'm just not good at it. Like you feel the power of the [ __ ] ocean. It's Well, how about just the idea? I've done those cruise ships enough to be like, it's just if you go off that boat, you're as good as dead. It won't stop. Look at this. It snapped the cargo ship in two. The wave was so big, it snapped this [ __ ] ship in half.\n[ __ ] that. And this is nothing compared to some of the waves I've seen. Some of the waves are [ __ ] bananas.\nApparently, if you fall off a cruise ship, they they can't stop the ship. They can't. Look at this [ __ ] Look at this [ __ ]\nsays, \"Fuck that.\" If you fall off a cruise ship, they can't turn around and get you. There's more death by fire a year or by sea. No, they have to like call the the uh like the Coast Guard or whatever to come and find you, but you're dead. They give you coordinates that mean nothing. Yeah, they throw some [ __ ] donuts out to you and you That's it. There's no You have to find the donuts in the ocean. The ocean's [ __ ] flopping, dude. The worst part of that for for me is that if I fell off, I'm holding on to a donut and hearing the sounds of Tesla slowly slink away.\nOh, they're doing acoustic signs. [ __ ] Take pictures, you [ __ ] Yeah, there's a there's a cargo ship that's on fire right now in uh I forget which ocean, but it's filled with EVs and uh apparently one of them caught fire in the middle of the ocean. It's why you can't put [ __ ] electric cigarettes in your [ __ ] suitcase, right? Same thing. I pay attention to none of those rules. Remember when those Samsung phones were lighting people's cars on fire? Indian Coast Guard battles massive fire and container ship listed off. I don't know. I don't think this is the one. It's an Indian. There's another one, Jamie. That is uh that's uh UVs. It's all UV cars. Isn't there theoretically people in some of those cargo things? Cargo ship carrying UVs on fire.\nUVs. Sorry. EVs, not U. Sorry. Is that just a wire or is that how they get people over sometimes? And there's people sometimes those cargo things. Oh, yeah. No, that's real. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. So that's filled with electric cars. I wonder whose cars they are. It just says EVs. It doesn't say if it was Teslas, it would say cargo ship filled with Teslas. They would throw Elon under the bus for sure.\nYeah. I'm not sold in the electric car. They're great when they work. It's just like if you have them plugged into your house, it's the [ __ ] You never go to the gas station. You just plug it in when you go to sleep at night. It's easy. I think you need your car to be more reliable than your phone. Well, they're really reliable. The thing is about driving them like Teslas, they never [ __ ] up. I've had three three of them. They I've never had a problem. Really? Yeah. Nothing. I had one problem with like a windshield wiper motor. It was simple. Do you get rid of them because just it's time you get a new one? I get a lease. You get a new one. Yeah. Okay. So, it's not like you're not like, \"Shit, this thing's starting to No. No. Well, they make them better every 3 years.\" When do they peter out? What's the death of a good question? You can get them, you know, that are many years old. It's just their batteries degrade slightly over time. So like if it first comes from the factory with 340 miles, you know, after like five, six, seven, eight years, it's probably got 280 miles or something like that, you know. So that's all just efficiency kind of goes down. Yeah. But but for driving around town, like if you just take it into commute, it's easy. You just plug it in when you go to bed at night. You don't ever have to go to the gas station again. Silent. They move faster than anything you've ever driven. I mean, how how quickly do you get a return on investment? Because the amount of money you save in gas has to be like I don't know about that. I'm wondering about the miles things. That's what I'm saying. I remember like when I was a kid and you remember this too like they would say oh like Hondas are the best because you can get 200 some thousand miles out 300,000 miles. I don't think that even exists anymore that a car is supposed to I think Toyotas you buy Yeah. You buy a Tacoma those [ __ ] will last forever. The reason I got the reason I got the Acura was because last forever. Yeah. My uh my buddy really Nick Roshford. Shout out Nick Roford. Great comic. And he uh he was like dude trust me. He was like get an Acura. He was like it'll last 250,000 miles. I'll give it to my kid when he graduates high school. Like just my friend Matt Farah had a Lexus with a million miles on it. Yeah, that was the other option, too. He said, \"Get a Lexus or an Acura. Those are the two that have the the greatest resale value and also just the the shelf life of the car.\" I got a Ram and a Jeep. America. America. [ __ ] yeah. You know, Rams are like this and we laugh at Toyota Tacomaomas. Get that little stupid rice burner out of here. I've had a couple of those Lexus SUVs, the 570s, LX. [ __ ] great car. Great. Comfortable as [ __ ] Big. It's like it's so smooth. It never [ __ ] up. Never. They never have problems. Don't buy an Audi. I'll tell you that much. Why? I just totalled my Audi and it was It wasn't the Audi's fault. It was a fender bender. It was literally a fender bender\n\n\nThat fender was going to. That fender was softened up by all the other fender benders. Dude, I was like, I was like, for sure, this is just an easy repair. They came. They're like, \"Yeah, this is total.\" Each headlight is like $5,000. It's insane. How much is your car worth? The car was, I bought it at 70,000 when it was new, and then How long ago was this? I had it for four years, and then it depreciated, the it depreciated in value to like $25,000, and the damage was like $22,000. Wow. Yeah. Well, most of that was to take off the airbrushing you put on the side, you Puerto Rican dumbass. That's [ __ ] It was crazy. I was like, I was so bummed. You know what's a really great value? If you want to get a car, get like a Mercedes S-Class from like five, six years ago. Still amazing. Honey, Mercedes S-Class. You order it for me. No, the old ones. An old car. Yeah, get them from, you can get them from like 10 years ago, and they're [ __ ] awesome, but they're like super cheap, but they're so well engineered, and they'll never break. But for like less than like an Accord, a brand new Accord, you can get an S-Class from a while ago. Well, I thought about that. Is it possible to get like an old, is there such thing as a brand new old car, old engine? What do you mean? Like what car? So, can you buy a brand new 2019 car? Like what do they do with that one? 2019 is not even what I'm, I'm talking about. Like can you get like a 1997 Mustang and then somehow get a new that kind of motor in it? Original, like no computer, none of that [ __ ] in it. Just like the one you could fix yourself. You definitely can. Brand new. Yeah, there's companies that'll do that for you for sure. They'll make a car with a carburetor, the whole deal. Most of them don't though. Most of them use a crate engine. So that what they'll do is like they take an old car like a 68 Mustang and they put a Coyote 5.0 in it, like a modern Ford 8 cylinder Coyote engine in it. Yeah. The new ones. So it has like an ECU. It has like what was like this little motherboard, like you program it, you know, and has electronic fuel injection. I used to have a Grand Cherokee that when I got out of the car sometimes to start it, I had to, I learned I had to get a hammer and hit a certain part of the engine and then it would start. I think it was the starter possibly. You had to clank it and it did start. Why did you just get a new starter? Why did you hit it with a hammer? Broke. This is way back, way back in the day, too. So, I, I got the car, I got the car from uh, it was one of those like uh, what do you call it? The auctions, you know, they repo cars and [ __ ] like that. So, it was a piece of [ __ ] But I would uh, clank and get it start. There's just nothing. When I, when you open up, you could have a car for a year at this point, a brand new car, and open it up, and it looks brand new because it's not, it's barely engine parts, right? It's mostly computer. It's like a big plastic covering over a computer essentially, right? You can't work on it. When you say, when you bring it in and go, hey, it's having a problem. They go, did the light go? This happened to me last. The light went away, so the light's not on anymore, but it was there. They could plug it in and find out that there was a light that came on at some point, but they can't do anything to it if it's not happen. You know what I, there's not a thing where it's like there's this clicking. It's probably a belt. Those days are over, I think. Oh, really? I think so. Hm. See, they seem confused by you going to bad mechanics maybe. It's the dealership. Oh, okay. So, they probably have everything connected to a computer program, and the computer program talks to the, to the, the computer that's in the car. I think that's what you have to do. Every thing now. It's no more like uh, if we knew our, my mom, Chuck and Larry. No, not Chuck and Larry. That's the gay guys that got married. Chuck and Al were like my mom's too. Like uh, Oh, now I think about it too. She probably [ __ ] Chuck or Al. My mom really both of them. Your mom? My mom really threw the puss around to make sure we had what we needed when we were younger. Not like in a prostitution way. Good lady. Yeah, it was a good lady. But Chuck and Al was always our car mechanics, like for our car, just you know. Uh, obviously to them, they can't even be in business anymore with cars now. Well, there's a lot of people that still have old cars. They want to get them fixed up. There's a lot of people that really just like driving analog old cars, you know, but not enough for the amount of like auto shop stuff. But don't you hate when it's like a really famous guy? Who was a, who's a famous guy? He drives like an old pickup truck. I want to say Carlson does Christian Bale. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he drives old Tacoma. Yeah, like an old Ford or Yeah, it's a Toyota. Yeah, I think Jimmy Butler the athlete. But I just feel like he's doing it to be like cool. It's like, bro, you [ __ ] you don't need to drive an old ass truck. I'll tell you, Post Malone showed up to a Shane show in a [ __ ] muddy shitty big tires truck, and I believed him. Yeah. Does that make sense? When he got out of it, I was like, \"Yeah, this is this thing, but he's also got a Lamborghini and a [ __ ] He's probably got a whole, you know, most hanging out with country friends or his black rap friends.\" He's got one of those Raptors with six wheels. Yeah. Yeah. That's his Christian bills. Same Toyota Tacoma since 2003. It just bugs me for some reason. They're bulletproof. Keeps the [ __ ] thing. Yeah. It's clean. It's not raggedy. But those things last forever, man. They really last forever. It's like if you wanted a car that's going to last forever that you can buy right now, get a Toyota Tacoma. They're [ __ ] bulletproof. They're so good. Yeah, they, they just re-released one of these old timey looking trucks, and it's like, it's like vintage look. I think that's going to be another thing that starts happening. It's like vintage looking cars that are brand new. Toyota did. I don't know if it's Toyota or another. There's a, it's a pickup truck that's coming out that looks like an old pickup truck, but it's brand new. Like a jerk off though if you bought the novelty car of the time. Anyone that's still rocking a [ __ ] one of those like Union Jack little like Mini Coopers or something, you'll be an [ __ ] A Fiat, you'll be an [ __ ] Do you remember the PT Cruiser in the early 2000s, late '90s where they were like, \"Hey, everyone likes that Zezy Top car. Let's make a very cheap version of that.\" My wife had a Dodge Neon. That was maybe the shittiest car that's ever been mass-produced. I had a Dodge Neon. You had, you had to at some point. It was crazy. 14 bucks, dude. It was, that was, I think it was $10,000, $100 a month, no money down. Like this was like the cheapest car ever. It was such a piece of [ __ ] I think two companies ended up making it. Oh, really? I think it switched at one point from like Dodge to something. Yeah. Remember the Yugo? It's so weird. Yeah. Yugos or a Dodson? Was it, was Yugo from Yugoslavia? Is that who made it? Is that why it was called the Yugo? That was a garbage little car. It's amazing how many cars I've been in that are now like defunct. They don't make any Mercuries sables and [ __ ] like that. But I have no trust or belief in a brand new like car that comes out. Well, Saturn, Saturn doesn't exist anymore. Saturn was like a brand that everybody had back. I trust Hyundai now. Do not trust Kia. Hasn't been long enough for some reason. I don't know why that one's Genesis. Genesis. I see. That's Hyundai. That's Hyundai's Lexus version. You know, their high-end luxury version. It's [ __ ] really Oh, cuz Lexus is Toyota. Yugoslavian. Yeah, you go Yugoslavian. That was a garbage. Yeah, I knew that from delivering auto parts. That car was like $5.\nCost more for gas than the car. What did you take your driver's test in? Oh man, I wish I could remember. I think I took it in my mom's Barracuda. My mom had a 1970 Barracuda when I was think hums. Oh, it was fun. I was in a stick shift Chevet.\nMy mom's white stick shift. You had to learn how to drive. That's good though to learn how to drive and do a driver's test on a stick. Like you really know how to drive if you're a kid. It is one, it is one of those feelings though where you're like uh, even my daughter, I'm like, it's a good skill to have driving stick, and it's, she'll never be in a world where it will ever most likeary. It was fun though. I had an Audi Fox that was my first stick shift car. I never had, all my muscle cars when I was a kid were all automatics. But I had an Audi Fox. It was this uh, cool little [ __ ] front-wheel drive shitty 1973 car. It was great though. Like little four-cylinder. It was like the first car that I had that was little that can like move around. It's like this thing's fun and like learning how to shift.\nEverything today is just, you, you're barely connected to what you're driving. You feel like the shifting is the, the steering is electric. Everything's, everything's smooth. Back then you felt the cars. Yeah. That's gone. That Well, that's why people like to drive old cars, still like to feel them, you know. Yeah. I would, if I had the money, I would get like something. That's why I said I asked about the, if you can do a new engine in a car. You have money. So many cars I miss. You could get a car with a nice engine. No, you literally have two brand new cars. You're not going to lease. You're not going to Ram yourself. You're not going to fix it yourself, right? So then find a mechanic, you know, that you trust. Find, you know, ask around. Get a relationship with this mechanic and get a [ __ ] cool car.\nThat the same way your mom did, though. Not that way. Yeah. Not that way. Well, if I could. Um, do you have a car, Luis? What's like usually something I dream? The dream, the dream changes. When I was a kid, Jaguar, the one with the actual, the, the head, the hood ornament that was a Jaguar. I looked it up a couple years ago. I wanted to get like, it's like an old school Jaguar SJ6 or something or whatever it was. Early '90s. Yeah, early '9s. They were the coolest cars. I ever looked it up recently, and I found one for like N grand. Like just, it looked great. And then I was going to buy it, and then a friend of mine was like, \"Dude, you literally to get anything fixed on that car is crazy. Like you'll never find the parts. Like it's just, you're just That is a tough one. When I was young, the one that like the cool kids had that you're like, \"Damn, I wish I had that.\" Was that boxy looking Mustang 5.0? Oh, that was the one with the vanilla ice. The convertible. Yeah, that's the exact one. Everyone, they put the 5.0 rims on it and the convertible, and that one just, that was the one I was But talk about it changing. When I was a little kid, this was the one of the most hurtful fat comments ever in my life. Um, when I was like, \"Sh, dude, when I get older, I want to get a Mazda Miata.\" And they go, \"That's going to be a [ __ ] roller skate on your fat body.\" And I was like, \"Okay, well, I guess I'll get past the Miata.\" And now sometimes you see one on the Roadster, and I still go, \"Damn, it is pretty cool looking.\" You ever seen those Miatas that they do conversions with? They put a V8 in them. Mm. Yeah. There was a company called Flying Miata, and they sold it to another company that's in Florida that does it now. I don't know what the name of it is, but they take a regular Miata and they stuff a big [ __ ] aluminum GM crate engine in it, and it's got like 500 horsepower. It's madness in this tiny little car that weighs nothing. Just lifts off the ground. But apparently they are a riot to drive. They're like the most fun cars to drive cuz they're super light with crazy power. And these new engines are not that heavy. So it doesn't [ __ ] with the balance that much. It's like slightly heavier than the stock engine, but insane amounts of power, and it sounds insane. When, when we were down at a Nashville comedy festival, there's a guy who used to work at the club who pulled up in a like gold and blue um Lamborghini. Lamborghini. And it was, it was just like the colors were crazy, and it had some writing on it, and we were so curious about it. He won it in a sweep stakes. He actually won a Lamborghini in a sweep stakes. These are those cars. Like, give me some volume so we could hear this thing. The Miata. Yeah, these are the flying Miatas.\nOkay. That's not a Miata. I mean, it's just the front. This is the Miata.\n[Music]\nThat sounds crazy. Um, but there's a new\n\n\nA company that does it now. It's not them.\nAnd there's some better videos where they show like what the Who's driving that thing? Cat Williams.\nThing was hugging the corners. Imagine if Cat Williams like enters F1, starts winning races. Oh, you never thought I could do it. F1's really like right in the streets of a town. Yeah. In Monaco. They drive through the streets. They do it in uh Vegas, too. They did it in uh Canada. Oh, did they? In Montreal, I think one year the festival was there. That was like they were preparing for F1. Oh, wow. It's wild. They do it out here, but they do it at the Circuit of the Americas. That's what that neon sign up there is. Our neon died, I think. Did it die? I think it died. But um that [ __ ] racetrack out here, Kota, it's awesome. Watching Formula One, there's You can't imagine how fast they're going. Oh, is that the place?\nIs that the I think I think I did one of those rockfests there backstage or oddball tour to me. Is that the one that has the overlook thing behind it? The the F1 track. Yes, that's one of the talk about getting over a fear in one day or I've never felt. So, it's got it's got a overlook thing you take. One floor elevator just goes right up to the top of that. Half of it's concrete, half of it's glass. Very thick glass. But I've never had this happen before. When I got up there the first time, I was gung-ho to walk out over that glass and go. When I got to the glass part, the glass is the floor. Yeah. But it was concrete. When I got to the glass part, my I almost fell forward cuz my legs stopped.\nLike my legs stopped moving. Like like my body shut down. Be like, &quot;No, no, no, no. We're not ready for this.&quot; By the end of terrified of heights. Yeah, you should be Yeah, there it is, dude.\nThat's [ __ ] And by the way, they didn't have I don't think those red things were there when I was there.\nDid I take the uh on top of the the this this the needle in um the Stratosphere in Vegas, the Strat? Oh, yeah. They have like a roller coaster at the top. And then they also have like you know the the ride that goes straight up and then just drops. I went on it with my son. My son has no respect for me anymore for this dude. Cuz I was sitting in the chair literally just like they didn't even start. They they they pull you up for like maybe five feet first and I thought I was at the top. I was screaming like a woman. Everybody was cackling at me. My son was making fun of me and they didn't even go and then when they finally went up it was I mean I'm so deathly afraid of heights. Even if I'm strapped in. Oh my god, dude. I could deal with that. You should be. I'm afraid of falling. It's adorable. If you're not, you're a freak. Those [ __ ] those freak climber dudes.\nThey're just freaks. Oh, the guys that like like jump from building our friend climbs like Mount Capiton with [ __ ] just chalk. How about the thing that Ralph did that in New York you can do? You can go to the top of some building and they have a thing where it's like they have you're you're like connected to a line, but do you remember the D show to you take a picture something in New York where you're like feet are on the building and you're hanging off it like over New York City. Yeah, I [ __ ] that up. Crazy. It's just like [ __ ] that. I but I I'm not like a just for a thrill. I would I maybe could have gotten talked into skydiving young. Not a chance. I've had some people try to talk me into it as an adult and I'm like jumping. [ __ ] If my daughter's got to tell the [ __ ] story. If my daughter's got to tell the story of her dad dying in a [ __ ] wing suit or something like a jerk off.\nBrian Redband's dad was working at this place. One of the people he's working with is a skydiver and uh always trying to get him to go. Come on, come with us. One day goes to work. They're not there. What happened?\nNo,\njust didn't open. Didn't open. That was a There was a great It happens. There was a thing called McCloskkey on Netflix years ago. Was it a documentary? It was in fact a documentary about a uh about a snowboarder guy. He was like an extreme sports guy and he died because he jumped he like par he like base jumped into an uh national park and when he landed he was being chased by the rangers and the cops to arrest him and he went in the water with his parachute and everything got caught up and died he drowned in the water I believe then they did a a thing on the news they did a they were doing like a base jumping you know for this guy like in memorial of him like a it was a demonstration it was like it shouldn't be illegal\nSo what they were doing was people were jumping, parachuting down, and when they landed, it was almost like organized. The cops would then arrest them. They were all getting arrested for doing it, but that was their protest that we're all going to do it. You're going to have to arrest us all. And then while they're doing all that, just in the background, you just see someone go just like way in the background. Oh god. It's like, yes, this is why this is stupid. Yeah. [ __ ] all that. I I've never had any of that adventurous [ __ ] in me. I've gone skiing, which I feel like is adventurous enough for me. Um, Ky Kennedy and Sunny Bono, but it's actually really dangerous, dude. Skiing is like [ __ ] wildly dangerous. Just sometimes I was I was in um Park City and you're just going down the it's a really long trail. Like 20 minutes like just you're just going and going and going. But there's times where like I'm going to the edge and all it takes is like just a little less control and you just fly off the edge of a thing and you're done. Oh yeah. How do cars not go off like up in the canyons in the ballet every year? Like tons of them. They do constantly. Isn't that how Tiger Woods crashed? He went off one of those cliffs. Didn't Isn't that what happened, Jamie? No, not quite. Not quite. I thought he hit a tree. Um, there was one guy who was tweeting. He was like a famous plastic surgeon. He was like tweeting and they they discovered that he was tweeting at the very same area where he fell off the [ __ ] cliff. So, he was just like texting while he was driving and not paying attention. He went off the side.\nI that's that's the most two in 10 moment of my life when I'm going over those like through the Hollywood Hills like Yeah. I mean I really it's it's crazy you could that you're able to drive that close to like certain death. Yeah. Oh well how about the [ __ ] drive up to San Francisco if you take the coast.\nThere's times where the left side of you is just cliff. Yeah. the thousand like famous places like in the world like in just other countries where I mean I've been to a few countries where you're driving there's no rail your tires are just like along the edge like almost hanging off it's [ __ ] terrifying [ __ ] dumb other countries oh man so countries where the only way to get is these [ __ ] roads through the mountains and sometimes there's boulders that fell in the way and you got to move the [ __ ] landslide and hope it doesn't hit you while you're driving amazing all years of driving for comedy and how long I've driven. Never seen a falling rock once. Not once. Sun's falling rock. Never seen falling rock anytime ever. I've only seen it on Never. It's crazy. You've never hit one deer? I was in a tour bus to hit a deer once. That was pretty normal. I I hit a rabbit recently. Oh, yeah. I tried though. Oh, did you? No. I thought you meant with your foot when you killed them both. No, I did. That actually happened to me recently. I was moving my lawn furniture cuz my [ __ ] Mexican [ __ ] lawn care people never move the furniture back to where it's supposed to be. And I'm moving it back and I felt my foot go into the ground and I heard beep beep beep beep beep and these baby bunnies jumped out of a bunny's nest which apparently they're underground. I had no idea. And um yeah, they [ __ ]\nSo Lewis reported those guys to ice.\nPiece of [ __ ] What a piece of [ __ ] dude. Come on. They're just here trying to live the American dream, dude. Uh yeah, the one jumped in my pool and went belly up and I thought it was dead. I scooped it out with the scooter, threw it in the garbage. My girlfriend was like, &quot;Are you sure it's dead?&quot; I was like, &quot;I'm positive it's dead.&quot; It was Did you try feeding it carrots? No, she really did bring carrots out to these little broken bunnies. I was like, &quot;They don't want your carrots like these.&quot; Did they live? Stop trying to They did actually. I thought they were going to die for sure cuz I I called it was it was on Memorial Day cuz And I called like um like a rescue an animal rescue place and they were like, &quot;We're closed today. Call the cops. They'll come and get them euthanized.&quot; And we were like, &quot;No, I'd rather them die a slow death in my backyard.&quot; And eventually they just started hopping around. The one guy you we call him limpy and uh he was just [ __ ] pushing himself with one leg.\nAnd you should have glued their uh you should have glued their hands to their genitals and then hung them from something and oh another autophixiation gone wrong. Great. The guy from NXS, David Car and now these rabbits. So he either lived or a hulk came and got him eventually. But do you think that some of those auto exfixiation guys were murdered and they were set up to be humiliated and look that way? No, I think Do you see now that now they try to take the jerking off part away from all those stories now? Really? Yeah. They don't want How many stories are you reading that are autooticiation?\nBut he's watch a whole documentary on it. No, I'm my own documentary. Sound Garden jerked off to death. Lincoln Park jerked off to Anyone who hangs himself. You mean Chris Cornell? Yes. But he I don't think he was jerking off to death. Was it you? This is Jay's theory that he thinks everyone theory. It's a strong theory. Did you make it yourself? Yes. Who has clear evidence? There's no evidence. You don't hang yourself from a [ __ ] door knob that low when you're not trying. They flash knock out while they're doing it and then they just die cuz they're being choked. 100%. They pass out. That's it. Yes. 100%. You heard it here first. And Lincoln Parkin Williams. Robin Williams. They said put a note. But again, I think now the since Michael Hutchins from NXS famously did that and David Keredine that was news that made news they were they died from that. How good could it possibly feel?\nUh we during sex I've had people call in choked out like why you're nutting. I've heard people call in dude people say it it mimics a lot of times former addicts do it because it mimics like the feeling of like the high like heroin. That's what they said. But that's just people who called in uh to say that. Who knows? But because Michael Hutchinson and David, it's like the first when you think of their name before you think of even in excess or any of the songs, you're like, &quot;Oh yeah, he died jerking off. Jerking off.&quot; David Car in all those movies. Died jerking off. So now they'd rather have you think they were just depressed and going through it than saying that because that's all you're going to be known for now, right? See the theory? It's not a bad theory if the family can hide that information. Like it's important that he was jerking off. He killed himself. The world doesn't need to know he was jerking off while he killed himself. Well, you'd rather feel that it was on purpose because he was desperate and sad then he was such a weirdo that he had to jerk off and hang himself from a [ __ ] doornob. I heard there's a conspiracy involving the David Keredine one. I think David Keredine had run a foul with some shady characters except Yeah. Five venoms, dude. I think it was in Thailand, wasn't it? In Thailand or something like that where he won. He's actually kung fu. Is it uh is there a conspiracy theory attached that we should call Sam trip the earth bring HPV to finally\nhe was kung fu when I was a kid when I was a little kid he was the guy that was doing martial arts on TV\nKane everybody call everybody grasshopper back then yeah but getting choked while you have sex rules bring it back up I really hanging on it\nwas wearing fishnet stockings and a dark wig when his body was found hanging in a Bangkok hotel room. Grainy images printed in the tabloid Thai Wrath reportedly show kung fu actor suspended from a clothing bar in a closet. Red woman's lange appears to be in the bed adjacent to the body. Oh, this is somebody who hated him. Yeah, this might be right. Uh he Okay. Found with his hands bound above his head and a rope around his neck, wrist, and generals. How would one do that to themselves? Sore details of Kill Bill Star's sexual life begin to surface as the photos generated more questions about the actor's mysterious death. That seems like you couldn't do that yourself unless you're like really ingenious. How do you How do you bound? It says hands bound above his head. How you do that? And a rope around your neck, wrist, and genitals. You need a really cool friend. How are you doing that? Oneinch punch. Oneinch punch. Dude, are you are you pulling\n\n\nIt tight with your hands? Wow.\nWhat? Okay. Yeah. What's [ __ ] that?\nStart getting carried away. Sorry. You\nlook like a real gross. Yeah, there's a\nlot of accusations involving. He's\ngiving his wiener the old five finger\ndeath punch. But I mean, if what are the\nlike standards of like in Thailand if\nthey find you hanging wearing women's\nlingerie? Do they really want to\ninvestigate? They're probably like,\n\"This guy.\" I don't want to touch that.\nIt's icky. They probably like, \"How is\nhe even How is it autooticiation if his\nhands are tied up too above his head?\"\nThat's the weirder thing. I never saw\nthat before. Those hands were above\nhis head. That sounds like he got that\nsounds like somebody walked away. Well,\nit's one of those might have gotten\ncarried away and somebody just left cuz\nthey were like, \"Whoop!\" Right. Like\nmaybe a lady was giving him head and\nthen he came and then blacked out and\nshe couldn't get him off the ropes so\nshe just split. Just [ __ ] booted out\nof there. Not like Lincoln Park and\nSound Garden were just jerking to each\nother's music. I don't I think some of\nthem are just depressed. Dude, Bourdain\nwas just depressed. But who hangs?\nThere's so many people hang faster ways\nto take care of this. They don't have\nanything around them other than a rope\nand they it's an impulsive decision. And\nit's also like a a romantic way to kill\nyourself. It's like who's got rope? You\ndon't need cord. You need cord. How\nabout the guy your jizz sock from all\nyour autoerotic sophiciation? The guy\nthat was connected to the Clintons that\nhung himself with electrical cord then\nshot himself in the chest with a shotgun\nfrom 40 yards away. Yeah, it looks a\nlittle sus as the kids like to say. If\nyou had to kill yourself, Joe, how would\nyou kill yourself if you had to? Well,\ngun is definitely the best way, right?\nCuz it's quick. Hey, what if you shoot\nlike your front lobe off and don't do\nthat? Don't do put it in your mouth like\na real man. That was the [ __ ] Richard\nJenny. Richard Jenn. He missed. Yeah, he\nmissed and died later. Yeah, he died in\nthe hospital. Oh, that'd be my biggest\nfear is like shooting like just angling\nit wrong and then just I saw a video of\na guy who did that with a shotgun. He\njust took off the front of his face and\nwas blind. Lived. Yeah. Life is now\nworse. Richard Jenny takes his life.\nDave Kuier never even tried to take his\nown. Richard Jenny was funny, dude. Very\nfunny back in the day. He was the\n[ __ ] man. He was depressed that he\nnever w up being a movie star. He wanted\nto be like he wanted to be the next Jim\nCarrey, you know? He did. Yeah. He got\nclose with the mask and they said it\njust made him more bummed. Yeah. It's\ncrazy because he's like to us all the\ncomics back then he was the guy you know\nhe was well he was on all those shows.\nWere you doing comedy at a time? Did you\ndo you have performances on like A-list\nand uh Standup Spotlight or VH1 those\nthings? Yeah, I did a bunch of those.\nCaroline's Comedy Hour was a big I did\nthat. I did um MTV Halfour Comedy Hour.\nThat was Paulie, right? No, that was\nPaulie was totally Paulie. MTV Halfour\nComedy Hour was uh another show they\nwould do. You know, you do like 10\nminutes or something. I forget what the\ntime was. VH1 did one of those with\nRosie O'Donnell kind of hosted them or\nsomething. Yep. Yep. Those seem it\nseemed like it was a pretty fun time in\ncomedy. Comedy was pretty polluted with\nlike a lot of same old same old. Yeah.\nuh at the time. But I mean like what a\ntime to kind of like that's why it was\nfunny when when I was opening for David\nall those years he couldn't get a grasp\non like the change that I was\nexperiencing that he cuz he was kind of\nlike after 3 years like you want to go\nwith me to this club again and I'd go\nabsolutely and he go you headlining this\nplace yet and it's like it doesn't work\nlike that anymore cuz he's from a time\nwhere they said if you got an hour of\ncomedy together then you to that's what\nthey say when you tour that hour of\ncomedy he goes you can't just do that\nlike he places the book you well Dave\nbefore I mean back when I started this\n21 years ago like people would just have\ntheir act you remember Seinfeld's\ndocumentary where he was like he's like\nI'm going to get rid of my act after 20\nyears and have a new hour it's like\nthat's what everyone does now the\nstandard of comedy has changed so much\nbut I feel like was always like that he\nwould turn over he was very prolific um\nno no for sure I'm saying he didn't get\nthat like it changed that now you have\nto be able to sell tickets right to get\nbook places for it wasn't just like well\nyou're one of the comics who has an hour\nin the country there was a time where it\nwas that it was like these guys just I\nthink it was like the two coasts really\nwas all of it you know I mean then the\ninternet I think really opened it up to\nthe rest of the country and it's like\nsaturation yeah you used to be able to\ngo to clubs and build a market so you\njust keep returning you turn like once a\nyear and after a few years people would\ncome to see you like oh Big Jay's coming\nhe's really funny we saw him last time.\nSan Fran Punchline, Stress Factory are\nmaybe two of the only clubs that really\nI know there's more oh the the\nProvidence Comedy Connection let me go\nthere and have enjoyed watching it be\nlike, you know, giving me a couple\nhundred for a weekend to change over the\nyears. I opened for you. You made $600\nfor the weekend as the headliner. Yeah.\nYeah. They give you a chance and if\nyou're good and they know you're good\nand they give you a chance that people\ntrust them because they got a long\nhistory of booking good comedy. It's\nlike, who's this guy? Is he good? Ah,\nlet's take a chance. Right. But there\nbut places got afraid. I remember that\nthat hurt so much. I opened for Steve O\nwhen he first started doing comedy uh\nstandby performing uh and I'd done DC\nimprov with the tail and stuff before\nand I did that weekend and I hate when\nyou go hat in hand to places and you get\nbad news. cuz I remember going to the\nbooker there who was like someone who's\nlike so friendly to me now and she's\ngreat you know but like it was so hard I\ngo hey just I'd love to come back and\nheadline are you like an off weekend\nwhen people don't want to do Fourth of\nJuly Thanksgiving whatever and she goes\nyeah I'd love to but you don't sell any\ntickets so it's all about selling\ntickets and she's kind of laid it out\nlike that and I just thought it was I\nwas like well how do you I didn't even\nknow how to start making that happen\nwhen we started like Legion of Skanks\nand stuff. Well, podcasting sort of\ncreated an opportunity for comics to the\nbest. Yeah.\nPeople, they know us. They feel like\nthey're really like sitting here with\nus. Well, they really are, right? And we\ntalk like this if we were in the green\nroom. The difference between podcast and\neverything else is we're really talking\njust the way we talk. Yeah. You know,\nbut everyone also gets mad too it like\nwhat the thing is besides stand up that\nmakes it happen, whether it's podcast,\ninternet videos. I've learned also to\nstop having that cuz people get a lot\ntoo much wrapped into that. like there's\na social media comic or there's a\nwhatever it goes buddy I don't know my\nex-wife does comedy and people ask me\nlike are you mad that she does comedy\nlike I can't judge why anybody gets\ninvolved in it I got involved because\nsomebody suggested it to me it's crazy\nto even want to to care it's like who\ngives a [ __ ] say why'd you do it go oh\ncuz I was having funny tweets so I\nfigured I'd give it a shot like okay\nthat seems like a good enough reason as\nanybody else starts the first decade you\ndon't even there's no path like what is\nthe path to like even making money\nyou're just doing it blindly going like\nI hope something happens eventually.\nPeople get mad because I think there is\na path now to making money very quick\nand people are doing it and so it's that\nit's the Howard Stern used to [ __ ] on it\nwas that famous thing with him and Ari\nShaffir on the idea of podcast but when\npeople were shitty about that I always\nunderstood his anger at least I don't\nagree with it but I understand when he\ndid the well his anger didn't make sense\nbecause he was already super famous. No\nbut his argument was saying I had to do\nAM shift Yeah. 2 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. uh in\nthis shitty town and I had to do this\nand I and I played music until they\nrealized it would be better to let me\ntalk 10 years later, you know, and he\nand he went through all that then it's\njust like well you could flip on a\nswitch and if you have an audience\nalready or connected to somebody who has\nan audience like you're doing it already\nlike you're just doing it now. Well,\nalso the difference is we all hang out\nwith each other and do each other's\npodcasts whereas those radio guys all\n[ __ ] hated each other, right? Like\nHoward Sterns.\nYeah. They would talk [ __ ] about each\nother all the time. Anthony used to have\nuh what was it? Uh uh Jotoberto where\nthey would just find shitty radio shows\nand they would have their fans torture\nthem for an entire month. Oh, so funny.\nBrutal. [ __ ] brutal wrote. Yeah. Cut.\nIt was Doesn't have to be, right?\nBecause it like you could only be the\none big radio guy in Philly, you know,\nand if Stern was coming into Philly and\nif they were going to open up like a\nsyndication thing, he was going to talk\ncrazy [ __ ] on the big guy in Philly,\nwhoever it was or whatever city it was.\nI do feel it's interesting watching. I\nwonder if this happens with every\ngeneration. The comedy dollar gets\nstretched though because it is kind of\nfunny. Not that it necessarily hurt. I\nthink the now with like having these\nkind like sham I'm opening for Shane at\nsome of these arenas and stuff. It's\namazing. He's getting like 18, 20 some\nthousand people into these places and\ndoing it. Um one that's very difficult\nto like think of new jokes when you're\ndoing comedy like that all the time. But\nWell, you do clubs for sure. No, I do\nclubs. No, but I mean you have to like a\nShane will do clubs also. Oh, no. For\nsure. But I'm just saying like a ticket\nto see someone in an arena is was before\nthey'd be able to see everyone they\nloved was coming through the improv or\nwhatever and then a couple were doing\ntheaters, right? Like now it's like it's\na [ __ ] night out at like a sporting\nevent to go see comedy where it's like\nthey might not have the money next week\nto go see me or Luis at a club. I think\nit has changed. It's interesting in that\nway. Well, there's some people that just\ndon't want to spend that kind of money\nto go to an arena anyway and they'd\nrather go see someone in a club. Sure.\nIt's a better experience. That's how\ncomedy is supposed to be. The best\nexperience though in an arena is in the\nround. In the round is like it's like a\ngiant club. It's like a giant club cuz\nthe people on this side are watching the\npeople on that side laugh and you're all\nlaughing at each other. It's very\nintimate weirdly even though there's\nlike 16,000 people. The comedy the only\ncomedy I don't love at all of the three\nthings, clubs, theaters is theaters.\nTheaters is impersonal from the crowd\nenough and also personal enough that\nthey you could still do bad. They could\nturn on you with theater. Um, possibly\nif you're not the person they're there\nto see or even if you know what I mean.\nThere was like a Nick Schwarzson thing\nthere where he they he turned on him.\nWell, he was lit on edibles. You could\nremember what the [ __ ] he was talking\nabout. My point being my point just\nbeing they weren't with him no matter\nwhat. Like they did turn on him.\nSomething about the arena. And again,\nShane's doing an hour at these things,\nwhich is impressive as hell. For the 20\nminutes I have to do, it's like how\ncould this go bad? Like it's just if if\nanyone's laughing in there, it sounds\nlike a million people. Shane Shane had a\nguy open for him. I don't want to trash\nthe guy. I heard it was a sound issue\nthough, but he just like, dude, he just\nstarted getting booed. Dude, getting\nbooed out of an arena is crazy. I mean,\nyou have to feel like it has to feel\nlike being like you're getting the same\nreaction like that the visiting team\ngets when they go to that arena.\nIt happened to a comic. Kill Tony Arena\nshows too happen somebody will do two\njokes in a row that bomb and then the\ncrowd's like, \"Fuck this guy.\" And then\nit's almost fun. I think it's cuz people\nare in that environment. They think it's\nfun to do it. TJ when TI got booed\nsomething when he was doing comedy like\nat a big arena. Oh, yeah. Well, it\nwasn't, you know, he didn't have it\ntight. You can't do that. You can't just\njump into, you know, but you just lose\nhim. So like Damen Lemon, very very\nfunny comic. He did like the Hot 97\nSummer Jam comedy thing and like they\nturned on him hard and when it turns it\nturns. The most famous one of all, Bill\nBurr on the traveling virus tour, Opie\nand Anthony back in the day in Philly.\nWell, that's because they had turned on\nDerrera before. Yeah. And then he came\nout. Yeah. He said, \"Fuck this crowd.\"\nAnd he spent 15 minutes just [ __ ]\nIt's one of the most beautiful moments,\nlegendary moments in comedy. So, I'm\nfrom Philly and it's one of my favorite\nlines ever about Philly that is\nindicative of that town that I love is\nhe says, \"Joe Frasier is from here who\nbeat Mike T or beat Muhammad Ali. No\nstatues to him, no nothing. And you have\na statue of an a fictitious Italian\nheavyweight. Yeah. Like you piece of\n[ __ ] threw batteries at Santa Claus.\n[ __ ] this town.\nIt's a classic. And he kept rattling off\n\n\nSeven more minutes. Yeah. Like I know.\nThat's funny. He had to quit that tour because everywhere he went then they would start booing him because they'd be like, \"Do Cleveland now.\" No. Yeah. That was like a That was like This is before viral videos were happening like that and it was such shitty grainy footage. Um, but that's when I I mean maybe my first year in comedy that happened a couple years in and you're just seeing that and it's like it's such a comic's moment where you're like yes just [ __ ] Well, it's a big p it's a big moment to have in comedy. I said a few of them when you when silence doesn't scare you anymore or just the mo just I could talk into a microphone especially for 15 minutes under any circumstance. You know what I Like it'll suck if it's a terrible you got they're already booing. Go out in the very beginning. There's no one there. But like I'm not afraid of the moment. That's a big that's a big thing to get over and that's what you know being scared for the moment. When your head do well overseas the first time I was like do they even understand English here in England? The first five minutes if you're doing a headlining stuff that's not going well and you're like a [ __ ] it's going to be another hour.\nGod damn it. Are you a long time guy or do you try to do like uh like when you headline something? I do an hour. An hour. Yeah. Especially if I'm on the road. Yeah. Always. I don't really have an hour right now. So, I'm like putting it together. I think last night I did 50 minutes, you know, and like some of it I keep forgetting my new stuff, you know. It's a lot of new stuff cuz it's all since August. Sure. You know, and I took a couple months off where I wasn't doing standup at all. I was like, let me just refresh my brain. And then I hopped on, started doing other people's shows. Then I had some old bits that I'd never put on the special and I started bringing them back and piecing it together. But it's like you got to have a real set before you take that [ __ ] on the road. You can't think you could have like a club 45 minutes and go do an arena. Like if you're going to do an arena for an arena for sure. You got to have a real set. It has I work out in the clubs on the road. Have to particularly I mean like but it's Burr said that back preparing for a special really. Burr said that back in the day where he was talking about someone special and he's like he didn't do the clubs and he's like he's right like this person like some person's they start doing theaters big theaters they do real well and they just keep doing that only same opening act every time crowd wants to see them and you develop like a it's like a soft act yeah it's not good yeah not good you need clubs man you need Yeah but Austin's great for that as well so you what you did down here is you um you got a you've cultivated like comedy fans that want to the edgier [ __ ] They want to hear [ __ ] up jokes. New York and LA, they don't really like if you're just going on a random popin set at the stand or the seller or the comedy store into some random show and they don't know who you are, you start doing [ __ ] up [ __ ] they get very tight, very tight. Like down here, like you go in the main room of the mother ship or at the creek. I mean, these they're comedy fans. They're like legit. It's become like a comedy destination. Kind of how like, you know, people go to New Orleans for jazz. Well, this town doesn't seem to feel like it has the same responsibility to like correct bad behavior on stage that New York has and LA has sometimes. Like they'll they want to let you know that you're out of line. They don't want you talking about a certain subject. It's like, did you think there was going to be when you opened the club, did you like foresee the dissension stuff that happens just within the scene? the people that don't work there bitching about that it's for this reason and the people who it's a walled garden and everyone goes they got in there because of this and I'm not in there because of this it's a they have a walled garden perspective you see a bunch of people having a good time and you're not involved [ __ ] those people it's normal it's a natural reaction that people have to like this intimate community of people that are all friends that are having a great time it's normal to hate it you but it's not all wild comedy there's a lot of like really clean comics that come here that kill like Vetion Own is [ __ ] pretty clean. He's hilarious sometimes. He's hilarious and murders at the club. He's a beast. He's a beast. But it doesn't matter. It's just funny. It's just whatever kind of funny you're into. Holtzman comes and destroys. I'm not saying I'm not I'm not even saying the booking is like onedimensional anyway. I'm just saying that did you even foresee there be comics that were going to be eventually like club sucks anyways. I don't hear about them. You stay away from stupid. I guess it doesn't make its way to you. They wouldn't. That'd be stupid. You're going to have people that complain about anything that they're not involved in. They're going to decide it sucks. Like, how could it suck if you've got two days of open mics? How could it suck if the comics get paid more than anywhere else? How could it suck if it's entirely set up for comedy? How could it suck if it's super supportive of the comedian? It gives them a path. What is the path for the young comic in Well, there's a real there's a real talent coordinator. You know, Adam Eaggan is a real talent coordinator. He sits there and he watches your set. He gives you advice. He'll have you come back and do it again. and he'll give you spots on certain shows. They start developing comedians and it's like any anything else like you know this business is about being likable and getting people to want to watch you succeed. Yeah. Where it's like you'll get your opportunity if you [ __ ] if all the other comics are like, \"Yo, this guy's funny. You should take a look at him.\" I've seen that happen directly. Um can I get the lighter again? Yeah. Well, we we have it set up for development. Like the whole idea is like you want to develop new talent there and Kill Tony's the best vehicle for that ever. You know, if you have a banger minute on Kill Tony, you could become a [ __ ] star. And if you could reproduce that every week like 59 times.\nKind of crazy that some of them have to do that, you know? I mean, it's it's an incredible writing exercise. It's kind of we the advice that I would have given a young comic, you know, 15 years ago. I was a young comic at the time, too. But it's like I like do not be on camera for the first decade that you do comedy. Develop and act first. But now a lot of these guys just they have the opportunity. It's like be detrimental if you really eat [ __ ] on it and you're like a three-year college. I don't think people remember people bombing on Kill Tony where it'll be detrimental to your career. It could be. But, you know, if you bounce back and have a great set the next time and the people love you. I've seen that happen, too. Look, it's you're taking a risk when you're doing a new minute every week. There's a real possibility you might have a dud. Yeah. You know, especially if you're new to the game, you've only been doing it four years. You got some talent, but you know, I genuinely don't know. I It's an interesting thing when I had to do it. Uh essentially at Madison Square Garden. Yeah. You guys were there. It's an interesting thing. They try to whittle down in your head like what the [ __ ] is on a minute. Yeah. Yeah. But they were all pumped to see you so it was easier. No, of course. That's an arena atmosphere too. It's like it's our game to lose. The garden I think was like the best arena Kill Tony show. Like it was like it was really cool. I went both nights and uh whatever it was like they were just the the crowds were so lit on watching those shows. Like nobody got booed. There was no problems. like super supportive. Super supportive. Well, some people got booed. There's some people that bombed. Did they? Yeah. Couple people. I think one someone went right before me. Yeah. A couple people bombed. It's Look, it's [ __ ] hard to do, man. And it's fun to watch someone just go out there and fail sometimes. Just It's what makes the people It makes the people that succeed look better. When I do Kill Tony as a panelist, I love watching somebody bomb. It's my favorite thing cuz then you just trash them. You get to [ __ ] make fun of them. That was I thought that's what when we started doing the show I I've been on I've been a panelist on Kill Tony I think I might have the number one amount of times like 25 times I've been a panelist and when we started doing it like back in the day in the comedy store in the the belly room um the most fun we would have is when somebody just had a hot one and then we would just [ __ ] trash them. It became way more supportive now like the whole show format is like really like Tony trying to put guys over but back in the day we were just mean. It was just like a mean evil [ __ ] thing. So fun. Yeah, it evolved. Those belly room days were wild cuz you know like half the crowd would be like comics. Yeah, it was there was no one there. It was fun. They But he kept doing it. I mean, he [ __ ] did it over and over and over again till he honed that [ __ ] down like a samurai sword. Yeah. No, I'm super impressed with it. Like, you know, Tony's the man, but that show itself is like I think it's inspiration even for like Story Warz, you know, very different show. It's just the idea of like the live the format and like Yeah. Yeah. That's uh you know Skanks has always been a live show but the development of Story War has been very like well it's also easier when you have a format like we literally just set the table and then play and it's like we don't have to really do much when you're on a podcast like this or like Skanks you have to actually kind of like be a little bit more present and like just sort of like you're trying to connect with the comics in a different way when we our our we do it's like a game show that we created and uh it's just super formatted so it's just kind of easy to just plug and play funny. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you guys by doing Legion of Skanks, just by the name itself, it like opened up the door to wild comedy because it's like you know what you're getting into. It's the show's called Legion of Skanks. This was a brilliant idea that Big Jay had like our our secondary tagline is the most offensive podcast on earth and it's not. There's more offensive podcasts, but it lets people This I think this reason we've never gotten in trouble is because you know exactly what you're going to get, right? It's cra like for anybody to complain. Why would you watch this if you do don't want to watch the most offensive podcast about you look like an idiot if you start complaining about it. Exactly. Adam Crawler had a great analogy about it when he did our show. He said uh he like this is what you guys why you guys get away with it. He's like like when Snoop Dogg goes to the Grammys, Snoop Dogg goes backstage and he lights a blunt and nobody's like you can't smoke back here. It's like you invited Snoop Dogg. You know what the [ __ ] you're going to get, right? And it's the same thing with us. I think people know what they're going to get with us and we sort of just, you know, play and have fun and do our thing. Well, you give a an avenue for comedians that's like, you know, we're where people know what they're going to get and and obviously people flock to it. I mean, Skankfest sells out immediately. It's because people love the vibe. It's fun. It's just fun. We're we're not here to take ourselves seriously. Also, broadcasting has done something for comedy. It's pretty amazing that I think broadcasters like the Howard Sterns, like had that all the time. It's very interesting when you meet the people. They know you inside and out. They know the time you told a story about the thing you fear the most and they know whatever. And I had to get used to stuff like that where they'd be like, \"Hey, did your daughter picking a college?\" And you go, \"The [ __ ] you?\" I'm like, \"Oh, I guess I\" And you're like, \"Oh, I guess I talked about that on the radio this week.\" Yeah. So, it's interesting. It's weird. You can forget that there's an audience out there sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you forget sometimes the things you say have weight to them, you know. No, absolutely. We found out the hard way when we started out. Who knew what this was going to happen when we started Legion? We started Legion of Skanks pretty early podcast times not think about it 14 years ago. Don't you think even now sometimes you say things you're like I shouldn't have said that. No, unless I don't unless it's about a person like sometimes it's about people. That's what we learned. We learn to stop making fun of [ __ ] children on the internet cuz they have families. Well, we do sometimes, but I've had to apologize to multiple families of mentally handicapped people cuz we've done bits on the show and I mean we've gotten in where they they would come to me and be like like what is wrong with you? There's like a child that has like Down syndrome. We're like we had no idea that they but then they get on the phone with Luis and they're like I didn't mind. It was funny.\n\n\nThe problem is, didn't that happen?\nDidn't someone say to you, \"Kidding?\"\nWell, no.\nThe, uh, twice now that happened, and both times I ended up becoming very friendly with the family.\nThey came out to see me at shows.\nThey brought the kid.\nNo, now he's your burden.\nBecause that's the problem.\nThe problem is, like, you're saying things with your friends like you would normally say, but then you don't realize.\nRon Bington calls a corner talk.\nJust corner talk with the guy.\nBut there's a real person on the end of these stories sometimes.\nAnd that's the thing.\nThe only thing that's changed is, I think, in the beginning, we would just say whatever.\nThere'd be a silly story, and now I'm going like, \"Well, all right.\nIs this person going to hear this?\"\nAnd it's just a normal person who's like, their parents are raising a special needs kid.\nThis is a tough enough life as it is.\nOh yeah.\nI felt terrible.\nLast time I came in here when you talked about, I was like, \"Hey, you know, was that video going around that girl freaking out?\"\nAnd I was just going like, \"Yeah, it's just like she wasn't ready for this moment, but I went through, didn't say the name on purpose.\"\nAnd there's so many videos on the internet.\nThey're like, \"Jay takes a [ __ ] on this girl.\"\nI'm like, \"No, it's not what I did.\"\nWell, yeah, sometimes you say things 'cause you're just talking, and then you realize like, \"God, that other person's going to hear that.\"\nI did that recently, and I, I'd like to apologize to this guy.\nIs this guy named Flint Dibble, who's an archaeologist, and I said he attacks other archaeologists like Graham Hancock, and he says some terrible things, but what I did was very counterproductive.\nWhat I said was like, \"These weak [ __ ] men,\" and I named him.\nI'm like, and then he tweeted about it.\nHe said, \"I have stage four cancer,\" and I like [ __ ] forgot he had cancer.\nI didn't mean him physically.\nI meant his behavior, but it, it made me feel bad.\nSo, guy's got a [ __ ] body.\nI was wrong.\nUh, it, what I said, I shouldn't have said.\nI, there's sometimes I say things, and I just think I'm talking with friends, and I realize it's going to hurt someone's feelings on the other, and it's counterproductive.\nLike, I'm doing the exact thing I'm accusing him of doing.\nHe's attacking other people.\nI'm attacking him.\nIt's stupid.\nAnd you can be funny with anything.\nYou don't need to, like, but I wasn't even being funny.\nI was talking to an archaeologist.\nI just get, I got angry at this process that sometimes, like, established archaeologists are attacking these people have legitimate ideas.\nBut I, I shouldn't have done it that way.\nAnd you just arch one passion.\nNo, it's like I, you know, I talk about a lot of different things, but I talk too often like I normally talk.\nLike sometimes when you're talking about, like, a serious thing, like you probably shouldn't insult people.\nIt just, it comes normal, like, \"[ __ ] that idiot.\"\nYou know, like, it comes out.\nSure.\nAnd you go, \"Ah, yeah.\nShouldn't have, you know.\"\nYeah.\nWe do that all the time.\nYou get loose.\nYou get a little too, uh, comfortable talking.\nCan I tell you also, that's the smart move I said that Howard Stern did years ago that I'm trying to get better at and do.\nWhen you think something's ridiculous, praise it and then use it, and you could show everybody without having to make fun of it.\nDo you know what I mean?\nOh, right.\nRight.\nThey'll make fun of themselves.\nThat was the, you definitely do that.\nWell, I do that sometimes when I'm questioning people, and I know they're not telling me the truth, and I'll say, \"Wait a minute.\nSo, what you're saying is,\" and so I don't even have to, like, say, \"That's ridiculous.\nThat's [ __ ] [ __ ].\"\nI just let the internet have it, you know?\nYeah.\nYou know what I mean?\nLike, Epstein didn't kill himself, you know?\nLike that kind of a deal.\nLike, okay.\nYou know, like, let the internet deal with this.\nI'm not gonna deal with this.\nThis is, like, I could only be so, uh, pushy.\nYou know, when people don't want to talk about a specific thing or want to give you an an answer that you think is pretty much gaslighting you, you're like, \"Okay, so that, that's a real UFO.\nAll right.\"\nthat you might, you know, I have people come in here all the time that I know are bullshitting me.\nI know they are, like, I, I feel it, you know, and sometimes it's just like, all right, you just, what are you going to do?\nYou'll call them sometimes.\nSometimes, but like, sometimes I don't know.\nWho was the guy years ago you had an argument with, but it was again sometimes when vernacular causes the problem.\nI feel like at the time you were just like in a rhythm of saying the word [ __ ] at the end of a sentence a lot, and you said something, you go, you're like, \"Come on, [ __ ].\nYou can't think that way, bitch.\"\nAnd he was like, \"You're calling me a [ __ ], or like, you're pulling the [ __ ] out of me.\"\nWho was that?\nWas it Crowder?\nOh yeah, that's right.\nWe were, it was a weed conversation.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd I thought I was talking to him like a comic.\nLike he would just go along with it, and he got genuinely offended.\nAnd I was like, \"Bitch, I think you're bullying me.\"\nYeah.\nWe said he, we were bullying him because we were, like, researching information live that was countering what he was saying.\nIt was trying, and he didn't have access to it.\nI was like, \"All right, you know, whatever.\"\nSo he's being a real [ __ ].\nI was trying to be a good host, and I wasn't, you know, I was being too like a comic.\nLike I could talk to you that way, and we would have fun.\nI could talk to you that way.\nWe would have fun.\nHe wasn't.\nHe was a little serious.\n[ __ ] You can call us a [ __ ] all day.\nProblem is, some people just, if you're choking me while I jerk off, whatever you want.\nSome people just get serious, and you don't realize they're serious.\nLike, oh, you're serious.\nLike, you're really upset.\nOkay.\n'Cause we're so used to talking [ __ ].\nIt's so normal.\nLike when people talk [ __ ] about me, I'm like, I would do that.\nlike, what am I gonna do?\nYou're too famous to not, you can't get offended.\nYou're, you're so big at this point that it's just part of the territory.\nThat's part of the problem with saying things like about that Flint Dibble guy.\nYou don't think about it while you're saying it, like you're saying it to millions of people.\nYeah.\nIt's like, it's not just talking, you know, and you're like, guy's dusting off a raptor bone, and you just see a tear hit it 'cause he's listening to you in his headphones.\nThat guy's a dumb idiot.\nI genuinely felt bad.\nMy raptor bone.\nBut it's like, I actually didn't have a bad time talking to him.\nWe had to confront him on this one thing 'cause he accused Graham Hancock of being attached to white supremacy and and and this, like, weird thing about Atlantis, like, how does that have anything, like, and he tried to deny it, and we pulled up the quote that he did because Hancock says, \"No blacks in Atlantis.\"\nNo, this is like this thing that these people do when they try to discredit things, like certain academics will do where they'll connect what you're doing to racism or homophobia.\nThey just try to, like, virtue signigle their way into a position where everything you're doing is wrong.\nAnd it's the, the thing about Atlantis is a weird one.\nIt's like, it's apparently at one point in time, there was some white supremacist that, like, was pushing the theory of Atlantis being this great white race, but that's not what any of the people that are legitimately trying to research it think.\nThey think it was in sub-Saharan Africa.\nYou think black people are going to let their hair be wet all the time?\nI'm no archaeologist, but I am a [ __ ].\nWhat do you think Atlantis is?\nYou think they get in the water?\nOh, isn't it the underwater city of Atlanta?\nYeah.\nWhat an idiot, right?\nI didn't think that either, John.\nWe're talking about the Bahamas.\nAtlantis, they believe, was this structure.\nThere was a series of concentric circles that had, like, a lake running through it.\nIt's like really fascinating because there's this place called the Reishard Structure in South Africa.\nAnd this is another one of those things that archaeologists will argue about because this thing looks like Atlantis, and there's this guy named Jimmy Corsetti, and he gets labeled a Nazi for talking about it.\nIt's like weird stuff, man, where they try to make you look like you're racist for pursuing this idea, and the people who defend that, if you defend a person for defending racism, you're defending racism, and it becomes this whole stupid argument that nobody really believes, and it's only exists on the internet, nobody in real life gives in academia, they, they believe it, and if they don't believe it, they use it as a tool, and they'll use it as a tool to dismiss you.\nBut this is the one of the things that came up during that co topic that when even archaeologists come up with a new timeline for things where it throws the old history into a tizzy, they attack them like, and they, we, Graham Hancock brought up this concept of Clovis first.\nThey used to think that the Clovis people, like, 13,000 years ago, were the first people in North America.\nAnd this one guy found evidence of people that lived a long time ago.\nAnd they [ __ ] ruthlessly destroyed his career.\nThey attacked this guy.\nIt turned out he was right.\nAnd they found these footprints in White Sands, New Mexico.\nThey're 22,000 years old of human beings.\nSo they were probably living here even before that.\nAnd but they destroy people that come up with an idea that throws their expertise into question.\nAnd that's what they're, they're all doing with Graham Hancock.\nThey, what they do is, he's pointing out that there's some real evidence that perhaps there was an advanced civilization that was thousands of years older than we think civilization started at no crime and only three-pointers.\nWell, it is in Africa.\nThat's the fascinating thing.\nIt's all in Africa.\nEgypt's in Africa.\nYou know, this all this sub-Saharan stuff where they think the reshard structure, let me show, show them what it looks like.\nIt's crazy because the area when you zoom out looks like it was hit with a massive flood.\nLike everything looked like all water erosion.\nLike it was like massive amounts of water just destroyed the landscape.\nIt still looks like that today.\nAnd it's in the exact same plate.\nLike it's, it's the mountains are north of it.\nThe seas below it.\nThat's what it looks like.\nAnd that is, like, the size that Atlantis is described in in in Plato's recollections of it or Plato's stories about it.\nYou know, there's a lot of debate about it, but the position that it's in and the weirdness of what it is makes a bunch of these ancient history guys that really believe in Atlantis, just like they really believed in, uh, Troy, they thought it was, they thought Troy was mythical until they found it, and then they're like, \"Oh, geez, Tro, Troy was a real thing.\"\nSo, um, there's a lot of these people that are the gatekeepers of academia, and they, they don't want anything to be dated older than what they've established and what they've taught in lectures, and 'cause everything's wrong then.\nEverything's wrong.\nWell, everything is wrong.\nThere's weird stuff like Lebanon.\nHave you seen those, those [ __ ] stones in Lebanon?\nUm, no.\nthere.\nThere's these immense, I think they're called the trilithon stones or the trillion stones.\nThey're so [ __ ] big, and they're supposed to be somebody moved these from a quarry and placed them in place, and you look at them like, how, how long ago, and then there's older stuff.\nThere's stuff that's built on top of it.\nLook at the size theory works here, but I think it's a bronosaurus that a man is controlling.\nBalbeck.\nThat's what it is.\nLook at the size of these [ __ ] stones.\nAnd if that one up in, uh, the top in the center, right to the right of that, Jamie, that one.\nSo that shows you the size of these [ __ ] stones that are in place.\nLike, if you put a person next to them, they'd be like, these are 5 m high.\nThat's [ __ ] bananas.\nHow many miles per hour is that?\nI don't know.\n5, 25 ft.\nSo those are 25 ft high.\n15.\nOh, sorry.\nThree.\nIt's three, right?\nYeah.\nSorry.\nMy math sucks, obviously.\nBut these stones weigh some [ __ ] insane amount.\nAnd there's no explanation.\nThose cornerstones, that's all one giant piece.\nAnd where?\nHow?\nHow the [ __ ] did you do that?\nAnd there's a bunch of [ __ ] in Malta.\nThey found Neanderl bones.\nSo maybe Neandertols were in Malta.\nAnd maybe the land bridge was connected.\nAnd there's all this confusion about the date of these, like, ancient structures.\nIt seems like people built other structures on top of them.\nAnd when they find stuff like this, there's like this great resistance of anybody to try to, like, say they don't understand it.\nThey always try to come up with some sort of an explanation even when it doesn't make any [ __ ] sense.\nWasn't the, uh, the coliseum, wasn't it completely underground at one point?\nThey, they discovered it.\nNo, no, no, no.\nThis, the Sphinx was underground.\nThis, but the head was above it, and then they cleared out the sand.\nThe coliseum was, you came off stupid as [ __ ] there.\nNo, I don't think it was underground.\nNo, no.\nThe coliseum has always been there, but they did used to be able to get water in it.\nThey used to have water fights that have boat fights in there.\nIt\n\n\nIt was crazy, bro.\nImagine really cool [ __ ] watching\npeople get eaten by lions in front of\neverybody. Imagine what that was like.\nWell, back then, you understand they\ndidn't like they would have these games\nand they would bring in like, you\nknow, they would have like hunts and\nthey would have like animal fights and\n[ __ ] like that. But it's like back then\nto see a giraffe it looked like an\nalien. Like they didn't they they had no\nidea what they would bring in animals\nfrom Africa like rhinoceros. Yeah. These\npeople didn't have YouTube. They were\ntraveling. They had no idea. It was like\nit literally like you're watching aliens\nfight. Have you been to the coliseum?\nYeah, it was incredible. Did you see\nthose things where they lift them up\nthrough the floor and then the lions pop\nout? A whole They had underground.\nThey have a whole pulley system where\nlike they have elevators and they would\nhave slaves like pulling people up and\nit was a whole show. It was a really\ncool thing. I appreciate you saying\nslaves. If they had that right now, if\nthey had that right now, we would watch\nit. If there's something on YouTube like\nI've already seen, have you seen the\nnight fights where guys dress up in\narmor and beat the [ __ ] out of jail?\nHarrington Harrington doing he does the\ncommentary for it. He's like the Joe\nRogan of night fighting. That's so\nridiculous, dude. [ __ ] They hit each\nother with battle axes and [ __ ] Oh, a\nscepter strike to the leg. But it's like\nthey look tough and then they take their\nhelmets off and they're just [ __ ]\nvirgins. It's like just these really\nnerdy fat dudes. Preemptive balling.\nSome of them know how to fight though.\nI've seen ones where guys take guys\ndown, leg kick them. They're MMA guys\nthat are getting into it. It's just\nanother like outlet, another outlet.\nPart of the floor of the coliseum was\nburied until the mid 19th century.\nOh, you were right. There you go. I\nknew. Yeah. One\ngian floor lay buried under 40 ft of\nearth. All memory of its function even\nexisted. What is is that the floor that\nlifts up? Is that what that is? Yeah,\nthe floor. There was stuff sticking out\nof it. And then they went and they s\nthey they uncovered that there was like\nan entire underground system like all\nthis [ __ ] It was actually all Did\nsomeone cover it up? Wait, did you go\nback to that description, Jamie? Because\nI think it explained that someone\ncovered it up. Well, I mean, they\ndestroyed most of Rome, so I'm sure it\nwas part of it. I wonder why they did\nthat. They were using all this [ __ ] for\nmy the the tour that I did of the\ncoliseum was boring as [ __ ] Mousolini\nfixed it. The guy wasn't all bad. What\nwere you saying, Jamie? What' you say?\nThey were using the pieces of the city\nfor construction or whatever else they\nwere building, new stuff, you know. Same\nwith like the the pyramids, you know.\nPeople shoot Mussolini.\nThey go, \"Unini, what a monster.\" Should\nI go clean the floor of the coliseum?\nThey did that with the pyramids. They\nstole the [ __ ] stones from the\noutside of it. Yeah. Well, I People are\nso gross. Yeah, it was crazy. Well,\nremember the Trevy Fountain a few years\nago in Rome? They they poured like black\nink in it or something. Just protesters.\nIt was like the And they literally had\nto drain the fountain and it took like\nhowever many months to clean it. It was\n[ __ ] up. The coliseum architects made\nchanges to allow new methods of\nstagecraft. Other changes were\naccidental. Fire sparked by lightning in\n217 AD gutted the stadium sent huge\nblocks of travertine plunging into the\nhypogum. What? That whole area is so\nnuts, man. 217 work. How do they have\nthose facts? Colosseum was really cool.\nI learned more about it. I did a uh like\na gladiator training program with my\nson. They have like it was like a little\nlike place you went and I learned so\nmuch about the coliseum doing that more\nthan the tour. The tour was boring as\n[ __ ] I went in like August. It was 110°\nout. It was insane. Um, he's\naggressively trying to make his son\nstraight.\nBut that was that was a cool experience.\nLike that's [ __ ] cool as [ __ ] man.\nThey didn't kill each other. The\ngladiators. Like that's all like that's\nall lies. It was none of that because it\nwas like pro wrestlers. If your\ngladiator killed another gladiator, the\nuh the guy who owned that gladiator\nwould have to pay the other guy who\nowned that gladiator. They're all\nslaves. So it was all just show. It was\nlike pro wrestling. They would cut each\nother, but they had like big like fat\nbellies, so they wouldn't cut each\nother's organs. They do had to like do\nit in a certain way. It was all show.\nReally? It did happen once in a while,\nbut that was more rare when you'd see an\nactual death. So, occasionally they\nwould fight for real to the death. I\ndon't even Yeah, I'm sure occasionally\nthey did. Where did you get all this\ninformation? From my gladiator training\nprogram. Really? Yeah. The guy's\ncertified.\nI mean, what are you going to do argue\nthe guy? like like the different weapons\nand the costumes they would wear and\nlike the type of armor they would wear\nis like there there was like you know\nwhatever like you know a couple dozen\ndifferent types of guys and like oh\nthat's the guy with the [ __ ] mace and\nlike a certain helmet and it was like uh\nit was free as well all the people in\nRome there wasn't a ticket price the\ngovernment would sponsor it so it was\njust to get people like you know keep\nthem happy and [ __ ] the richer you\nwere the closer you were like all the\npeasants would be up in the rafters\nright but uh so the movie Gladiators\n[ __ ] is\nIt's [ __ ] There was no thumbs down,\nthumbs up. What? What a common\nmisconception that gladiators always\nfought to the death. The winner survived\nand the loser died. Very rarely and\nusually with special dispensation from\nthe emperor would there be a sign miso\nbattles which automatically meant death\nfor the loser with no chance of being\nspared. So occasionally they died. Yeah.\nVery rarely they died. But they were\nlike celebrities. Like the gladiators\nwould come out and they were like,\n\"Wow.\" Some historians say, \"Oh, wait a\nminute. One in five died in battle.\nThat's a lot. Others say 1 in 10. Most\nonly lived to their mid20s, which\ncompared to Tay's Well, they would die\nof their injuries very often. Not be it\nwasn't like it was fight to the death.\nThey just didn't have medicine like\nYeah. They would get stabbed and get\ninfected. But Gladiator 2 was right\nthough, right? But that I mean when he's\ntalking about the water, they would fill\nit up with water and have boat fights.\nThat was a real thing in Gladiator 2.\nOh, I see. No. No. I'm bummed out. I\nthought they really fought to the death\nlike every time. Yeah. Yeah. God damn,\ndude. Well, I've got bad news about the\nWWF also.\nOh my god. Then you know what? I might\nas well pull the band-aid off if we're\nalready here. Wrestling also. But it was\nYeah, it was like akin to pro wrestling.\nLike they would have like personalities\nand people would like, you know, that\nwas a problem in Japan in the early days\nof MMA. Some of the fights were fixed.\nYou could tell and you could tell like\ncertain guys would win by leg lock.\nStomp and they'd have professional\nwrestling like promoters do those MMA\nfights. What does it say, Jim? is\ndescribing the animal hunts they did,\nbut I I'll skip ahead to this part here.\nHibian played a vital role in these\nstaged hunts, allowing animals and\nhunters to enter the arena countless\nways. Eyewitnesses describe how animals\nappeared suddenly from below as if by\nmagic, sometimes apparently launched\nhigh into the air. The hypoima allowed\nthe organizers of the game to create\nsurprises and build suspense. A hunter\nin the arena wouldn't know where the\nnext lion would appear or whether two or\nthree lions might emerge instead of one.\nYeah. Out of those like trap doors in\nthe bottom, a lion would just jump out\nand then and you're watching a dude like\nhunt lions. How cool is that, though?\nThis uncertainty could be exploited for\ncomic effect.\nHe goes, \"Guys, I'm not afraid of no\n[ __ ] ass lion. I [ __ ] a lion.\" He's\nright behind me, isn't he? Emperor\nGalanius punished a merchant who had\nswindled the emperor, selling her glass\njewels instead of authentic ones by\nsetting him in the arena to face a\nferocious lion. When the cage opened,\nhowever, a chicken walked out to the\ndelight of the cloud the crowd. Glennius\nthen told the herald to proclaim, \"He\npracticed his seat and then had it\npracticed on him.\" The emperor let the\njeweler go home. Whoa. So, they let\npeople So, it wasn't that killed him\ndays later. They were less mean than we\nthought. Yeah. Yeah. It was still pretty\nbrutal. Well, it was [ __ ] brutal time\nto be alive back then, man. Dude, one in\nfive got to live. Relax.\nMaybe one in 10. Maybe even one in 10.\nNo big whoop. I bet a lot of dudes were\nsliced up, though. You ever see those um\nNazi dueling scars where the Nazis in\nthe like when they were in like military\nschool, they would have duels with sword\nfights and they their faces would get\nslashed up and that was like their badge\nof courage. So all the Nazis that came\nover for NASA, they all these like crazy\nNazi dueling scars all over their faces.\nYou ever see those? Bro, it's so creepy.\nThey do the [ __ ] we do now in arenas,\ntoo, with like t-shirt guns.\nSnacks fell from the sky. Snacks as\nabundantly as hail, one observer noted,\nalong with wooden balls containing\ntokens for prizes, food, money, or even\nthe title to an apartment, which\nsometimes set off violent scuffles among\nspectators struggling to Nothing changes\ntoday. Nothing. There used to be a blimp\nthat would go around the Sixers stadium\nand drop coupons for hers potato chips.\nAnd I've seen people fall off of\nbalconies for them. It was as hot as a\nboil room in the summer, humid and cold\nin the winter, and filled all year round\nwith strong smells from the smoke,\nsweating workmen, packed in the narrow\ncorridors and the wreak of the wild\nanimals and no bathrooms and all.
