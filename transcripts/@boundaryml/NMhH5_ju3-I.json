  "cleanText": "Cool.\nAll right.\nAmazing.\nUm, so today we're going to talk about uh one of my favorite topics.\nI'll let I'll let Vibob te it up a little bit, but um we get more and more requests for this specific topic.\nAnd I think it's something we've been dancing around for a while.\nUm but especially last week, I think there's a lot of people asking, okay, but how do I do this part?\nHow do I do how do I how do I do human in the loop?\nHow do I do human in the loop for tool calls?\nHow do I do human loop for these things?\nAnd how do I do it in a production grade way?\nExactly.\nAnd yeah, and what Dexter and I are here to really talk about is something that you'll see that we mention all the time is a lot of these principles when building with AI agents are not that different than software engineering principles we've all had for the last 30 plus years.\nWe're just here to show how to translate some of these ideas that seem new into ideas that have existed for a long time and how to relate it and then how to use all the tooling that we already know and love and not have to reinvent 50 new vocab words just to use AI because in the end it's all really just software.\nUm, and today's topic is one that like Dexter said is very popular.\nA lot of people started mentioning it because this seems to be the real bottleneck uh for a lot of systems.\nWhen AI hallucinates a lot, what do you do?\nYou toss a human at it because a human can help out the process.\nIt's kind of similar to what we do in regular processes.\nWhenever you have a process where you're like detecting uh failure rates, you toss a human at it.\nYou add more process to your process and eventually you have a sequence of steps that makes it more rigorous.\nOne way to make model sequences really rigorous is to put a human in the loop uh and then have a human go and evaluate the system in some ways.\nSo some of the stuff that we'll talk about is really about software architecture design today.\nAnd I think one interesting thing that we'll note is there's very little AI involved in actually adding a human in the loop.\nBut you can use AI to make that experience much much more ergonomic.\nAnd Dexter is one of the few people that I've seen do this in a way that I think is like really does introduce new design paradigms to the level of like really a human is a new surface area at least from my perspective.\nI'll let Dexter share his thoughts on it, but I've always thought about like software as all about surface areas.\nSo when like the iPhone came out, we added a new surface area of touchcreens.\nWhen the iPad came out, we had a new service here of big touchcreens and those are very different than small touchcreens.\nThat's why iPad apps are uniquely designed.\nSome games only work on the iPad and others only work on the iPhone just based on where your hands are located.\nSome games only work on a computer and a mouse.\nAnd these kinds of surface areas make a huge difference in how we view it.\nSame with like TVs.\nThey're just surface areas for the same kind of software.\nWhen you as a human Well, and we ended up rearchitecting a lot of software so that it could work better across all the platforms.\nAnd we had to kind of like narrow the generic interface and push more and more specialization out to the edge where the users were interacting with it.\nYeah.\nAnd we didn't originally do that.\nMost software is just software.\nUh and then eventually to get the 99th like to squeeze more juice and make it more valuable from like the 80th percentile to the 90th percentile, we had to go do that.\nWe do localization in software.\nWhy do we do that?\nIt's purely to make it more ergonomic to certain demographics of users and that enhances business value.\nSame in the AI agent world.\nWhenever you add humans into the system, you're just adding more surface area that your software has to start considering when you're going to go build systems.\nAnd I think before we go do anything, I think we should just start with a demo today because usually we start with a whiteboard.\nBut I think today I want to show people so their imagination can start up and go do this.\nAnd like I said, Dexter has built tons of these tools.\nDo you want to show one of the tools off like the demo uh you were working on, Dexter?\nOh, you want you want you want to open with that?\nUm, yeah, we can do that.\nThe best way I think people should just see possible.\nOkay, cool.\nI'm going to show you kind of like what we're going to work towards, which is um kind of a thing I've been like dancing around for a while, which is like how do you how do you create agent experiences that aren't locked into the kind of chat GPT style workflow?\nUm, and I think the most asynchronous, most likefi interface that we can work with um as um almost as an exercise, I don't actually expect a lot of you to go build agents that work this way, uh but is over email.\nI build all my agents to work over email.\nUm, but this is an idea of a use case that is like much more asynchronous.\nUm, you have software that's going to get to a point where it needs to get input from a human.\nUm, whether it's get permission for something or just kind of respond to a request and then that's going to go to a human and you might not get a response for hours or days.\nAnd so in that world, you have to think differently about how you design your software versus, you know, if I'm just talking to a chatbot that I built in Verselai or whatever and I'm going to close the window and stop the server and come back later, right?\nLike it's only valuable in that synchronous use case.\nUm, let's screen share.\nAnd by the way, I know all of you can go watch these on YouTube.\nSo the benefit of actually being on the call is you can ask questions, you can hop in, you can you can make it interactive as you want, you can guide the conversation.\nWhat do you want to go do?\nSo, go do that.\nIf you see something, you're like, I want to pop in, ask a question, raise your hand, unmute your mic, and just ask.\nThese conversations are so much more fun when we actually like guide it in the way that the audience wants to go.\nCool.\nUm, so I'm guess going to share one window for now.\nUm, so this is just my Gmail.\nUm, and what we've done is, uh, oh man, let's just go ahead.\nYou have an AI that works agent, right?\nUm, yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah, that's what it's called.\nAI that works.\nUm, and we've given it its own email address.\nAnd I It's got access to a couple tools.\nCan you do some math for me?\nIt's some basic calculator tools and stuff like this.\nUm, but we can basically say, you know, can you add 10 and 12?\nAnd what's going to happen here is this going to cause an event to land in our server.\nAnd we'll get into kind of how all that we're going to actually re Oh, sorry.\nI'm not sharing right now.\nYeah, let's share the whole thing.\nUm, and remember all these are the things that we like to do is we like to use really really basic tools in the beginning like add and math because it makes it so unambiguous on what tool is supposed to do otherwise there's a lot of things that can happen.\nSo if you've been to the 12actor agents workshop you've seen us kind of build out these prompts and these prompt templates and BAML and stuff like that.\nAnd we'll get under the under the weeds of what that looks like.\nUm, but we'll see the model kind of finished here and said, &quot;Okay, now we're done for now.&quot;\nUm, if I go to my sent mail here, it's come back and it's responded to me.\nAnd I can say, you know, can you divide the result by 12?\nAnd one thing I'll note is we've, as an example of a scary tool that needs human approval, we use division because division might explode if you divide by zero or something.\nObviously, it's not uh but it's again, we like VBO said, we like to use toy examples so it's very clear to you all what's part of what we're trying to demonstrate and what's kind of like you can go swap in your own stuff here for this later.\nDoes that make sense so far?\nLet's see the division.\nLet's see the human in the loop.\nLet's see it do it.\nSo when this thing outputs divide, we've got some special logic where we say, okay, that tool deterministically requires approval.\nEvery time the model calls that tool, we need to ask for permission.\nAnd so that's going to call our deterministic code.\nAnd we'll see our new new new agent.\nAnd it's saying, &quot;Hey, we want to run this.&quot;\nAnd I can give it call something out.\nUm I want to call something out here.\nThe Can you go scroll up before you go do that?\nOh, yeah.\nUm and so in the first one when we added to add, it just responded with the sum.\nIt did the tool.\nIt did the math.\nAnd I want to note the LM didn't actually do the math.\nWe use a tool to do the math.\nAnd the LM created a text message from that to go and go return.\nNow the next thing that we did is we asked it to go divide that and it used that context um to go figure out how to go divide that and then model in this case it actually ahead to the same user.\nIn this case it's going back to the author that asked them to do the command and asked them to validate.\nWhat if we wanted someone else to validate the tool instead?\nYeah, we'll get into that.\nThat's a great question.\nUm, so here's our new here's our new message.\nIt took my feedback and it's trying again.\nSo, it didn't do the math yet and I can say like great.\nUm, and then that that will approve the thing.\nAnd someone asked a really good question.\nOne one more question.\nSomeone asked a really good question about us.\nCan you hit the triple dot?\nI want to notice this.\nThere's different ways and modalities of approval.\nDexter right now is using email, but see that link down here?\nWe could have just as easily clicked that instead and done approval as well.\nSo when you think about approval or rejection, it doesn't h like this is why LMS enhance the human loop experience and don't just like make it possible, they make it different.\nAnd this is a thing I say all the time, which is this idea of like we've been sending emails to users from software for over a decade now.\nIt's always been a part of a really important kind of growth loop.\nBut the call to action in all those emails is always click this link and get pulled back into the software which is a thing that the only real option you could do to review a report to see an answer to see whatever it was.\nUm you would click the link and then you would come into the tool and you would like see exactly what was happening here and you would say okay cool here's the thing and I can interact with it here.\nUm, now with LLMs, I can just respond with natural language from wherever I already am.\nAnd so it's it gives you a way to deploy your software to where your users already are.\nAnd I'm seeing more and more apps and more and more founders build really successful AI apps where someone will log in and configure it once and then from then on they just interact with it from other places.\nAnd so we'll see because this was approved it was able to run the divide function.\nUm, and I'm going to answer the first question of the thread uh real quick, but um, anything else quickly before we get into kind of how we're tracking the state here?\nI want to call one last thing out here, which is Yep.\nSo, the only difference between replying with human in the loop with over email versus clicking the button is clicking the button is like 99.9999% going to be correct.\nIt might still be wrong because a human might click the wrong button and there's process that happen.\nRight.\nWe increase our error rate a little bit by giving the user the convenience of responding in natural language because the model can get that wrong.\nYeah.\nRight.\nThere's a prompt here somewhere that is classifying the human's message as an approval or a rejection.\nExactly.\nSo for more nuanced use cases, you may not even want to allow human a human in the loop.\nYou may want to require that the human click the button manually like releasing your prod system to like a million users.\nYou and this is actually something that Anthropic was talking about with the model context protocol stuff and I know we have opinions on this but um they have this thing that they're working on called the elicitation API which is you know we don't want to just ask a question to the user but we actually want to give them some specific like options to choose from and those options might go back to the LM but they might also go back to a deterministic set of code where it's like hey which of these three really expensive ML jobs do you want to launch And you want to be very deterministic that only a human can approve the launch of a expensive ML job.\nExactly.\nUm, now we should talk about the session state and Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd we'll we'll actually go look at the trace for one of these conversations.\nSo we have this we have this thing that we're using that we're going to build up to, but basically we have this thread store interface where we can create new threads, we can get threads and we can update threads.\nAnd this comes back to our um concept from 12 factor agents which is like the state doesn't have to be open AAI message chain.\nIt can be any object that you want that you can serialize for the LLM.\nAnd so we just storing this in a file.\nWe have the JSON one that like the human can that the that the actual program will use, but then we also just have the raw text version.\nSo we got an email from me to AI that works.\nCan you do some math for me?\nAnd we have the inbound message.\nAnd then we called the ad tool and we got a response.\nAnd then we called done for now.\nAnd that so these different tools, the ad tool just caused us to go do the math and get the response.\nThe done for now tool caused an email to get sent.\nUm that's this response here, the sum of 10 and 12.\nSo we're we're taking each of these tool calls in the loop and we'll go detangle this and get under the hood and on the whiteboard in a sec.\nUm but then we got another human response.\nAnd so when I'm replying to this thread, the model knows how to route that back\n\n\nTo the right.\nConversation.\nUm, and so you have this divide call, and it actually, rather than running the call, we got a human response.\nHey, you got this feedback.\nAnd so at each step along the way, we're passing this into the LLM, and this is the prompt that the LLM is seeing.\nExactly.\nExactly.\nAnd I think the key part here is we actually built some debugging tools to help ourselves out here.\nLike the .txt file is just to make life easier.\nIt's like, here's the latest state of the message, but the JSON file is actually the source of truth.\nCan you click on that really fast?\nUm, which one?\nThe JSON file.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd I want you guys to notice some of the debugging work that we built here to make this easier.\nAnd I say we, this is Dexter mostly.\nUm, and I think we built the first version of this together.\nYeah.\nYeah, I know.\nBut still, um, specifically, I want you guys to notice this.\nUm, this thing is a timestamp that Dexter put on there.\nWhy did he do this?\nIt's because if you're debugging and you just want to quickly find the most recent thread, it is really freaking annoying to search through all a bunch of UUIDs to go find this.\nThis just makes life a 100,000 times easier and faster for debugging processes.\nAnd that's just software.\nYou could do the same if there were no LLMs involved.\nYou you you and you wanted to dump, you didn't want to write a bunch of observability.\nThe idea here is you can drop in whatever observability tool you want.\nI think even Bam, I might even be sending traces to the BAML web app.\nBut the point is, is like, if you think about your agents as just this sort of, um, I'm actually going to pull the whiteboard up.\nUm, show the JSON while you do that really fast, and then we'll show the whiteboard too.\nOne second.\nThis thing right here is just a SQL table.\nIt's a SQL table of a row of events.\nIt could be a SQL table.\nIn this case, we just did the most simplest backing store possible, which was a file system.\nIn the file system, every single thread has a UUID.\nEvery UID is associated with an email sender and a receiver, and a sub, and an email ID, right?\nEmail thread ID is what it's associated with.\nThere's Yeah, there's some like basic, basically, like the the inbound web hook payload that we're working off of is this conversation.created object.\nSo there's like the from, the to, the subject, and the message.\nAnd then if you forward one, one use case we can look at a little more advanced is like, what if I just want to forward an email to the agent and be like, hey, can you do the math for these people of this conversation, or hey, can you create a ticket based on this, this like debate we had on our engineering thread?\nAnd then that's just like more context that you might have to, because that other email's thread ID should be pulled in.\nBut I think the key part here is a lot, a lot of people view all this agent state management as complex.\nBut actually, instead of even thinking about as agent stuff, what I would do is I would purely think about it as it's just, if you had to build a system that was going to show, build stuff on top of email, how would you store that data in a database?\nThe fact that an LLM happened to respond to it is just a user ID, maybe with an extra metadata saying this is an agent, or this is like this user ID, but like nothing else matters.\nIt's just I want to save something that represents the state of a conversation into a database.\nYeah, it's good.\nUm, and I'll just say, like, in production, we run these agents, and we store all this stuff in Reddis.\nYou can store in SQL.\nYou can do whatever you want.\nThis is one of those examples of like, you have this interface in the state thing.\nYou can store this stuff however you want, as long as it's, you know, as long as you're keeping it.\nOh my god, VS Code started doing this lately.\nUh, I accidentally click on the author thing, and it's half the freaking page.\nUm, and you notice we store it in JSON and TXT, and we do different serializations because they're for different people.\nBut we could write this into a database.\nWe could write this into a memcache store.\nIt, it doesn't matter.\nWe could write this on like cold storage iceberg.\nIt, it, it doesn't matter.\nSo let's talk about how this stuff works.\nUm, so at the core of our agent is, um, what we call this, like, I'll call it the inner loop, the agent loop.\nUm, and this has a couple different components.\nAnd, uh, this comes straight from, um, uh, let me just pop into 12 factor agents.\nYes.\nWe got a question.\nNo, I was going to say we can just pop it.\nWe can show them the YouTube video as well if they want.\nIt's basically, and we did all the code for this in like three episodes back or something.\nFour episodes back.\nYeah, we did.\nWe did do all the code.\nBut we're not going to go too deep into it, but I basically like our inner loop is going to be this kind of like four-step thing.\nSo we have a prompt that is like, tell me what the next step is.\nWe have a switch statement, which is like, okay, based on what JSON the model output for the next step, what was the structured output?\nThen we're going to run some code based on, you know, whatever that JSON has.\nUsually there's like an enum that is like the function name or the function type.\nUm, we're going to store as new events happen, we store them in the context window.\nThat's that XMLA thing that we showed you.\nAnd then we're going to loop basically until we get to the final answer.\nUm, and the final answer is just another part of a switch statement that happens to not, that happens to tell us that the best thing to do is break out of the switch statement.\nIt's not anything special, and it's not even actually, I would say, like this.\nSo this is what I'm going to call the inner loop.\nAnd then there's another loop that I call kind of that we'll call like the outer loop.\nWhich is okay, we get to our final answer, we go to a human, and then a human might respond and push back into this inner loop.\nUm, and so the agent might go back in and call lots of tools.\nAnd so the reasons why an agent might exit out of the loop, there's a couple reasons.\nSo we're going to specialize this a little bit more.\nUm, and we're basically going to say we have a couple different kinds of things.\nWe have safe tools, things like readonly tools, or we say like add, multiply, divide are all safe, but divide is unsafe.\nAnd so if we call one of our safe tools, then we're just going to take the result.\nSo we have like our initial request.\nIt's a while loop for now.\nJust assume while loop.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nResult.\nAnd then we pass that back in, and we say, okay, what's the next step?\nUm, and so this code looks like, okay, we say determine next step, we serialize our thread, and this looks like, this is essentially a, uh, oh, that's why it didn't show up.\nUm, so you know, very simple prompt, you can make this much more advanced.\nI've added some of the stuff from the 12actor agents workshop, but you know, you're a helpful assistant.\nYou can give it some more behavior stuff.\nThe idea is like, when we build this stuff and we ship this code for y'all to use, we're trying to give you a canvas to paint on and give you direct access into the most important parts of the loop, because I don't know about you, uh, but I can write a switch statement, and I can write a for loop, or I can maintain one that's already written.\nAnd what you really want to be doing, the thing that's going to determine the accuracy and the like value and the magic of your app is how well you can get the agent to pick the next step while it's in this loop.\nUh, and so you want to focus most of your effort there and maintain control over everything else.\nYeah, exactly.\nUm, so we're going to run this, we're going to run this prompt, we're going to get our next step, we'll put it on the thread, and then we'll do a switch statement.\nSo, um, we haven't gone through the customer support stuff yet, but, um, basically, if it's done for now or request more information, we return the thread.\nAlso, if it's a scary tool, we return the thread.\nUm, and in this case, we're not returning any extra information about why we exited because we can tell based on, and I'll show you in the CLI here, basically.\nUm, and we'll do a multi multiplayer demo as well.\nUm, but in the CLI, we basically we're going to create a new thread.\nWe'll run it through the agent loop, and then we look at the last event, and then based on what the last event was.\nIf it was divide, then we're going to ask permission to divide, and we might actually go run that function.\nIf it was one of these other ones, then request more information for now.\nThen we're just going to do this message on the CLI.\nSo I can come here really fast.\nI want to highlight this code a little more.\nI just want people to read this a little bit carefully.\nI want you guys to think about one thing that's really important here.\nWhat we're not doing here is we are not doing some voodoo magic with some AI framework.\nWe're not doing something special.\nWe're just saying that this thread is a thing that we can analyze because it's an object that we invented of our own based on the application logic that we need to use, and we just said get the very last element of that thread.\nThen based on the type of messages we have, we know that there, there are three special names of messages that we need to handle.\nOne of them is we know that we're here because we know we know that it's one of those because we know we're in the outer loop.\nThe agent loop exited, which means we return, we the agent output a tool, that means okay, we need to go to the human.\nSo if it's a safe tool, we just call it and loop again.\nUm, but in here, we're call this this.\nYeah.\nSo basically the idea is like one of the things you should take away from this is like creating the agent.\nSorry, this one.\nYeah.\nExact the Y loop.\nYeah.\nYeah, creating the agent and like its core logic and its set of tools is kind of generic and reusable, but the way that the agent operates in the outer loop is something where you can swap in different interfaces.\nAnd so you can have a CLI to interact with the agent, you can have a web app to interact with the agent, or you can do the demo we started with, which is like an email surface area.\nAnd we'll get into how the email outer loop looks like.\nUm, um, I'll show you the once we get done looking at this code, I'll show also the um, the CLI and what that looks like.\nAnd I want to, I want to highlight this thing, like all we're doing here is when we get divide, we just tell the user this is what we're trying to go do.\nAnd if, if I didn't put this handle this case for divide, then our app wouldn't work because our inner loop says divide needs to exit out, but then this one is not handling divide.\nSo that's an error that I can build by default instead of having to go do it on my own.\nI just, and then I use another LM to actually detect approval or feedback.\nBut I don't have to.\nI could literally require a explicit checkbox here.\nThat's what it is.\nWe do like press enter to approve or type feedback to cancel.\nExactly.\nUm, so ask human CLI is not quite a tool that gets called because when you call a tool inside the loop, basically like I want to, this, this is one really interest.\nSo you could have a scary tool, and you could say in the body of this function, I want to say like, ask human if approved, then go do it.\nThe problem here is what happens if I call this scary tool and then the server crashes.\nThen we're in the middle of a tool call.\nLet's say the human approves it, but the server never, like the server crashes before we go do it.\nWhen I relaunch this, my context window is just going to have this thing, and we're gonna have to drop back into this loop.\nAnd so if you want to do asynchronous stuff, basically for scary tools and for human tools, anything basically that might take a long time that you want to be pursu, you could even do this for safe tools, although it's kind of feels like overkill.\nUm, you want to exit out of this loop so that you stash this thing on the context window and you store the state of like what was the last thing we were doing.\nSpecifically what you do is you edit, exactly, you just save it to the database, and then you do a new trigger, and even calling it outer loop is probably like might be a little confusing.\nWhat I would say is like the way I think about this is I just exit to a database.\nExactly.\nI just store this to a database somewhere or some file system.\nThen I trigger another workflow.\nIf you're familiar with like AWS SQS or anything, I basically trigger a second system that says now from here, send out an email to this human with this thread ID or the state ID that I have stored.\nThen that workflow will trigger, and then that human will respond and say, here's a response to this thread ID.\nI save that to my database, and then I just continue onwards.\nIt's the same as every other sort of process system that I would really be long term.\nAnd the fact so this is one of those concepts.\nYeah.\nGo ahead.\nThe fact that it's an AI is just an implementation detail.\nThat's the key part.\nDon't think of AI as the core part here.\nIt's an implementation detail, not the key part of it of how you orchestrate your workflows.\nRight?\nSo this is another concept from 12 factor agents that has nothing to do with human in the loop.\nThis is literally just a thing that all of your stuff should do, which is like you should be able to trigger your agent with some programmatic API like REST or MCP.\nAgain, like there's some email processing stuff going on the in the background here, but eventually becomes an HTTP request.\nThen when you call a longunning tool, whether it's a long long ass workflow or it's just interrupt or it's human human in the loop or whatever it is, you're going to pause your thing.\nYou're going to exit out to what I call the outer loop, which is conceptual, right?\nThere's, there's code there.\nIt's just, you know, it's a different layer of the execution state.\nWe'll take the whole context, put in the database, and say, \"Hey, we called that long running tool.\"\nAnd then we launch the workflow, and when it's done, it's going to call back to us with, uh oh, this shading is weird.\nUh, it, it's going to post a web web hook back with the state ID that we saved to the\n\n\ndatabase\nand the result of the workflow. And so we can use that state ID to pull our previous context out, push the result onto it, and send it right back into the LM. And this works for anything that is asynchronous. And again, you could do this for every single tool call you do if you want to be like really aggressive with your checkpointing. But if you're doing long running stuff, this is absolutely essential. And again, there are tools like Langraph. There are lots of different things that let you checkpoint workflows. You could look at things like temporal or cadence or whatever it is. We want to ship really simple examples so that you understand the concepts here of just literally just write it to sub file system. You can drop in your own database as as you want to. Exactly. Um and I'm going to I'm going to address some of the question that people have. One is this like local first architectures and CRDT. I don't know what CRDT is. This would be async pattern for workflows. Async isn't the right word because specifically this is not like async. This is more like task control flow. What I'm really doing here is I have a sequence of tasks that starts off some some way to start this job. I just also happen to have another entry point into here that doesn't start from zero. It's exactly it either. And you might even post the entire context window. Other people have done this where like they push the context window into the workflow system and say I store nothing here. It's the workflow systems job when you're done to send the entire previous context window plus the result back in and the cho and the and fact of these matters are like it's all your choice based on your design pattern that you want to go do. So for example, we all have clicked on mail to links and most time when you click a mail to link when you email someone it just opens up a blank thing but every now and then I click one that comes in pre-filled with some subject and body filled in. The whole point of that is there they don't save anything into a database. It's all encoded into the URL and you click on it and that populates all UI providers for what the next email that you're sending out. On the other hand, if you were to file an issue on our github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works, then we have some templates that we save into a database that you click on that reloads you and let you start from that template. And it's the same idea. We're just saving stuff to a database. Nothing too complex. It just happens that some of these things require long form may wait five days before a human checks that box. And because a human is checking the box, not a person, not an agent or something else, it it may take five days. It may take two weeks because they're on vacation. Who knows? We don't want to have that machine running infinitely on a spin loop until the human does it. So we we changed the software architecture pattern to have two separate entry points that say save, serialize, and then continue. That's it. And I think we need to clarify a couple things to address some of these questions in the chat. Um there's a lot of talking about like should should we make the AI do an unsafe tool or like by like basically having a tool call to fetch previous history from a previous workflow. Um, and like I want to put that together with like I don't see where the tool is made available to the decision loop. And so by Bob, can we clear your drawings? Sorry. I love my drawings.\nYou're a good drawer, dude. You're um we're going to put it in the Metropolitan Museum of Claude.\nUm I might uh Okay, cool. So let's talk about the decision loop, right? So we're giving this model a couple different sets of tools. We have the add tool, subtract tool, multiply, divide tool. And then we're giving it a couple different um tools that are like either done for now or clarification request. And so we're having the model like kind of declare its intent when it wants to contact a human or exit the loop. It's calling one of these tools, but we don't we don't treat it like we treat most tool calls, which is like the model did a thing, so we're going to call a function map to that. We are doing a very kind of custom switch statement here. We're like based on what structured object was output, we might go call a function and our handle next step is basically just going to switch over the tool type and go run it. But we also might just return the thread. And so let me show you what this looks like in the um in the CLI case just because I keep saying I'm going to show that off and I think it'll make a couple things uh a little more clear. Yes. Yeah, we should just run it. That's probably the easiest way.\nUm, so we didn't put anything in. I say, you know, add 12 and three, then add f, six to the result. I can't spell and you can you can see what the model is doing. It's literally taking this. We all saw what it just did there. Um, there we go. Gave me the output. Um, and I can say now multiply that by and then I'll just put in some garbage. And so this is going to call a different type of tool which is request more information. But these are both going to have the same effect which is I'm going to get another message printed to the console. Never mind divide the last result by 12. And now we're getting our approval step.\nSo, I can say no, use six instead of 12. And then I can hit enter and we'll approve that. And then I'm going to get my final answer.\nNotice one thing special here. When Dexter did that, when he when he said no, swap it out, it actually came back for another approval because divide is still scary. It didn't magically just go and say no. And there's nothing he could have typed into his code to prevent it from actually uh doing that because what it would do is it would actually call the divide tool. It would it would update this thread. Then it would say the next best action is divide no matter what the the get next thing will always be divide. Can you go back to your agent loop really fast? I was trying I was trying to get the I was trying to get the thread in there. I forgot we had that commented out. But you can do the same thread store thing for observe even though this is like really a throwaway conversation. You can you can add that thread store in um if you want to go back to the agent loop really fast and decide. Yeah. Yeah.\nUm let's go here. Like specifically what happened is once the model has picked divide as the next tool regardless if it's an update or anything else Dexter has enforced in his code I will always require a human approval. There's no there's no prompt injection ever possible that does that breaks that right. It's it's just not possible. It's always deterministic. That's 100. It's just code. It's just software. We've enforced in the software that this rule exists. So there's no risk for divide happening by accident because the only way divide can be triggered is it goes through here. Step back out to the outer loop.\nYeah. It goes through there. We return the thread. Then we ask human CLI which is piece of software that we wrote. Just named that. And then here we ask the human via CLI approval to go say yes for sure. And only if the human actually approves it will we run divide. So you could do this for example for refunding a customer order. It is not possible in an automated way to send a customer a refund back. So no matter what happens, no matter what prompt injection happens, it will always go to someone in your support team to actually hit the checkbox before money transfers over back to them. And you can enforce this in a guarantee.\nYeah. Um, we could even give that a shot. Do you have the email thing working?\nYeah, that'll work.\nUm, process refund.\nAnd by the way, so this one is actually not going to be with the user that we're talking to. This is going to be with the um with some third party. This is another like uh multiplayer example basically. So let's let's do this from the ground up. So we're going to add a tool. We're actually going to remove this because we had this request approval from manager which is again non-deterministic. It only happens if the LLM tries to do it. Um but let's add the refund tool here.\nUm, and we need a order ID and and things like that. And then we'll pop one step out to our agent loop and we'll say return it for human approval. And then in process refund, we're actually not going to we're not going to ask back to the person we're talking to. We're going to do to a different person. Um, I think we have task manager. Yeah, that's almost it.\nUm, yeah. So, this is going to ask the manager and um we can do it over email or we can do it over Slack. I did get the Slack thing working.\nUm and then what is this supposed to return?\n[Music]\nUm manager response and then you do some filter approval probably.\nYeah. So, this needs to return an approval.\nWe have some new type stuff in here uh going. But let's see what type is this. Okay.\nHuh? It'll make me feel better if you do or or false instead of exclamation mark.\nFine. Vertical bar. Yeah, there you go.\nYeah, there we go. Okay.\nUm, great. So, if it was approved, um, we'll do that. Otherwise, we will return that the user denied it. And in our handle next step, we actually need to handle that process refund now. So if we actually if it actually is approved and we pop back into like we use run this function in the inner loop um we will just push uh you know refund process successfully.\nYes. And notice that we're just controlling this. We're not using an LM to generate the response. We didn't do anything. We just we're just dumping out that the refund uh processed successfully.\nUm, yeah, we're not actually doing the thing, but this is where you would actually go process the refund. And then I think that's it.\nAnd try to run this. We'll slow back. We'll There's another type that you have down below.\nYeah. What's going on? You have to I think I don't know why. Why is that failing?\nOh, you can't call some.\nYeah, it's Oh, you know what it is? cuz we have this block twice. Yeah, exactly. There we go. Okay. And you want to delete the responsing at the top probably. Yeah. Yeah. And agent.ts has an error as well. Type systems are great.\nYeah, they fix everything. Um, and I want everyone to notice the reason that we know what this is.\nUm, oh, you got to return the thread. The reason that we know what this is, can you go to the process refund tool definition uh in your uh prompt really fast just in the BAML? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nSo, we just added another cool tool called process refund. That's it. It's just another data model that the model now has availability to itself. And you can see type line 22 and that's all we did. Now this tool that we have determine X accept used to have human tools or calculator tools but now has another tool called customer support tools to process refunds. We just added one more and you can actually you want to zoom out. You actually see this. Yeah, you can see this in the prompt now. It's saying you know we put in the user input and then um what should the next step be? So we can even test this with um a little test, right? Just write one. I don't have one ready. Oh, there we go. It actually did it for you. Nice. So, we can run this and we'll see. Okay, cool. The output was, hey, we need the reason for the refund and the amount to be refunded. And so, we can assert that we can write assertions of like, hey, okay, we expect the intent is request more information here.\nUm, let's make another test case. Yeah, we can make another test case. Yeah, sure. Yeah, details with all details.\nIt's for the jeans.\nThey're too big and baggy. What is this Gen Z nonsense? They were $200. And I think here now we output the intent process refund. Um, and now we can say, okay, if that reason is not good enough, then we can come back and change our prompt and be like, no, the reason has to have all of these characteristics, and we can write tests around that as well. Can you add that to description on line 17?\nUm, the description should be detailed.\nThese three reasons. Let's see what the prompt does. Um, must be 10 reasons.\nLet's see what that does. Let's see.\nDepending on the model, it will just hallucinate a bunch of extra reasons.\nUh, must be 10 reasons verbatim from the customer. And can you make it a string array instead of a string? I'm curious if that makes it I'm curious if that ends up. Yeah. Okay. But then we're going to run this thing. But this is like the popping around different parts of this. And now notice that didn't actually give me 10 reasons. And there might be nothing I can do in prompting world to make this better. So what I could do is I could in my code assert that reasons length is at least 10. And if it's not I change it to a request more information request programmatically in my code without actually relying on you would say you know like handle neck.\nExactly. Exactly.\nAnd so this is why it's so valuable to have control over the internals and the transition and that uh as we call it the boundary between the LM based code and your deterministic code and to be able to take yeah now get rid of that nonsense and actually change it back to just like reason being a string because like I think this is the whole point about human loop systems like this human loop system is really related to a couple of things but it's not just about just like how do you go do The point is control everything and then you can make the app do whatever the heck you want with plain software. Yeah. And human the loop just becomes yet another way to transition control flow between this tight inner loop where you're calling tools to external systems. And because we own the thread the thread structure and how we do the events and how we serialize this and move this around.\nIt's just software. All right. Should we try to run this? You think it's going to work on the first try? I think so. I think so. I mean, that's the beauty. Like, type systems usually solve most problems.\nAll right. I need a refund for jeans.\nThey're too big. What is this? Gen Z.\nThat's funny. So, it said process refund. Um, yep. So, now it should\n\n\nEmail.\nYou, I believe. I think, let's see. I'm going to check also.\nHit that refund button. It might be here. Here we go. There you go. So, agent support agent needs approval for call this thing, and I can say, like, can you ask them for, is this, was this one from just now, or is this old? Yeah, that's the right one.\nOkay. What color the genes were first? And so I can reject this and give it feedback. And we can go and look in our thread here, and we can go inspect what's happening.\nAnd then it asked, and then it came back to the user. So it's already come through this. It saw that we, we passed this context window. And what also becomes really cool is we can just turn these into test cases really, really easily. And so if I want to change the behavior in this case, make this a test, I can quickly just pass this in. And we assert that the intent is request more information, which, by the way, is exactly what happened here. So, it's asking me what color they were. Neon pink. And then it's going to come through and try again. And we can come through. And again, like, we're using human layer to manage this Slack stuff. Um, I think that, like, most of what we do at human layer is open source. I think that the thing of, like, wrangling Slack webhooks and moving information around like this is not a fun or interesting part of the job. And so we want to solve that. Um, but I can pop in here, and now I can approve this. Um, but you can send this via any email API, any Slack API. You can implement this yourself. This is really all meant to just be conceptual.\nExactly. Um, cool. Refund has been processed. Yeah. And now notice here what we did. We just, we literally triggered the message that the refund is done. And the LM actually made a nice, prettier message for the user from refund done to a nice, substantial message that's custom to their needs for the genes. And then it added a nice little helper text, cuz, like, feel free to reach out as well. And we, and we could have, again, could done all this not over CLI, over the customer's email. And the whole point is the customer could have initiated all this over email. We would get our emails on our approval request in our system. So a manager is approving it, and we go do that. But we all know how to build that as software. The fact that we could have built that independent of LLMs means that we could have, we, we are simply just doing the same thing where, instead of writing the stuff on our own, we're just doing it with pure software here. And what I think Anub asked an interesting question, where does human layer come into play? The whole point is, at some point, if you want to go integrate with humans and, like, have humans be a part of the system, you're going to have to build something akin to PagerDuty at some point. Uh, from what I see of what Dex has built, and I don't know, Dex can speak for himself, but, like, that's just a lot of code you have to go own and maintain. And, like, Dex has just built some really nice CLIs and SDKs to help you integrate and manage that system. So, like, if you want to escalate from the support agent down to, like, the manager, you're going to have to build that control flow out into your dashboard, you're going to want to have built an audit trail. You'll want, you'll want to build Slack integrations. You'll want to build email integrations. You'll want to, you'll want to build text integrations, and human layer just makes that easy, so your code looks simple, and you get to, can you show the HL send? Yeah, there you go. Create function call that code that he has. Yeah, so this is an ask manager, where we basically, you can configure your channel of, like, where you, how you want to contact the person, whether it's email or Slack or whatever it is, and then you can do this, like, fetch human approval, and we also do in the server when we get to the done for how you can use human layer to kind of, like, append a message as your, like, final answer to the thread and wait for a response.\nIt's kind of just, like, it's just an SDK to help you increase the surface area of ways that you can communicate with your app, instead of having to write all that code yourself. You can add the surface area of email. You can add the surface area of Slack. You can add the surface area of text, et cetera, so on and so on. You can add the surface area of permission management of escalation flows, et cetera.\nDoes any questions today, uh, about how, how this system works, and, like, how we leverage humans as tools, and how, by, I think, I think it might be, I'm looking at the question. I think, um, I, I think it might be worth just popping back to the whiteboard and kind of finishing what we were sketching out here. I can find that window. You want to text me a link, by the way? Um, and while, if people have questions while we go do that, if people have questions and want to hop on and ask a couple, that would be, uh, very open right now.\nYeah, AJ, come on.\nUh, yeah. Um, I'm just wondering if the human loop event loop can change the prompt. Uh, I'm just, I guess, just, uh, from an architectural perspective, I'm just wondering what the relationship between the BAML file and the agent plus human in the loop plus tool call is. So, uh, is there a way during the human in the loop pause to update the prompt of, yeah, the family file? Um, that's, remember, your prompt is just, like, variables that you pass into your code. So, one thing you could do is, the, the text file that Dexter made is just, like, a, can you show the text file of your current system that you have?\nYeah. Oh, the, um, the thread. Yeah. Yeah. We could eas, like, this is a UI that Dexter made in some sense. This is a UI. It's text file UI, but it's a UI of the current state in our agent dashboard, and we could build our own UI that renders the JSON blob or the database entry in the format that we want for our users. And then what we can do is we could let, in the approval process, instead of just doing a checkbox yes or no, we could literally just let the user, let our people edit the prompt or edit the state, and that gets passed into the message. We could have them check a box on the state. Right? Can you go back to your JSON blob?\nWe could add more metadata into other than events of, like, add, add really strict prompt in the thread object. Like, we could have more metadata into here that we have. We could have less metadata. It's like, strict prompt and, like, boolean true or false. And we pass that into the actual, like, prompt to go modify it. The way that we serialize the prompt is really exact. And now we trigger a totally different workflow.\nMaybe exactly determine next step or something. Yeah. Right. Or it's like, you know, determine next step, think harder. Yeah. Exactly. Like, it could, we could just trigger a totally separate prompt, and maybe that, or you can do something like, uh, you know, a lot of people have, like, working agent, right? And then it's, like, you know, we have our success agent. If you want to do multi-agent systems or something, you can have a thread, and then each agent gets its own thread, and you can fork these out, and so you can put whatever state you want on here, and this is, again, this is another one of the 12 factors. I'm not going to, it's, uh, unify execution state and business state, which is basically, like,\nThis one's really short. You can watch the video, but it's basically the idea of, like, just the thing that manages the workflow and what stage we're in and what's next and how we're operating can be the same as the thing that tracks the data we're passing to the LM. And this is the thing Vibb talks about all the time. We talked about in the first, like, episode back in March is, like, you should build an object that you control and create different views into it for your code, for embedding models, for humans, and for LMS. Yeah, but this is kind of the core of your application, and if you embrace this, then you can do so much.\nYeah, this is literally why in BAML, we, if you go back to the agent function definition, why we don't abide by any of the structure. It's like, who cares about chat roles? Who cares if it's a user message, system message? Some LMs do, some LMS don't. All we care about is this is a function that happens to take in this thread and returns one of these types. How we implement it might be LM specific. It might be totally weird. Who cares? None of us really care about that implementation detail. Or, I mean, at some point we do, because we need to increase our accuracy, but from a user standpoint, people that use these functions, they don't care. They just want to pass in a thread and get one of these types out. And I think what's beautiful about kind of, like, the Bamy way of making agent is, it, it actually forces you to write a little bit more code, but you own the code, and you can do a lot more interesting, fancy stuff, which is, again, like, what you want when you're chasing performance. I think this comes from, like, the electrical engineering background, maybe, is you want as many little points in the workflow where you can change things and tweak things and learn about what works better, because you're dealing with systems that are nondeterministic. Yeah, Derek has a question. More questions. Let's go.\nThanks. Um, you really got me going with the jean scenario and the hot pink. Um, so I'm imagining, okay, first, it's got to classify maybe as jeans, because they could have other product lines. So there could be access to, like, the product merchandising hierarchy. And then I thought of fraud detection loops, like, they might say a color, and you're like, \"Oh, we don't sell that color.\" You know, it could be flagged for human in the, you know, review as a follow-up or something. And then the other thing is, like, in any kind of customer service, this idea of a Pareto chart of the frequency of each, and then you can kind of assign a cost to the, the units in each, uh, bucket that's, like, a dynamic feedback loop to improve your product, what's causing the root issue. And so this has the opportunity to accelerate that. If all of a sudden there was a bad batch and something happened, uh, you know, this would be an earlier alert to that. And then also for convenience of the user, if you start to see this distribution of these are the three or four that, like, 90% of people come in, you can give checklists or something like that that become dynamic. Are these reasonable scenarios, or am I totally, like, out on?\nYeah, 100% of what you said is totally possible. Can you go back to your outer loop code, Dex, where you're handling the agent response?\nYeah.\nLike, um, where you get a message from the human, the human response. Um, oh, sorry, where you, yeah, this one. Like, right over here, we could run, like, in this case, we just save stuff to the state, and we move on with our life. But we could easily look back into our database and say, like, what's the skew IDs that match this, and that can be another function, whether it's an LM embedding or just regular code that looks for the IDs for that customer ID. Like, maybe we do a lookup of the customer ID based on the email or the phone number that's under the message. We look up the details. We look at their last purchase, and we're like, \"Is this the purchase you're talking about?\" And, like, flight companies have done this forever. Whenever you book a flight and you call them, we're like, \"Oh, are you talking about this flight that's coming up?\" And you just say yes or no. And they can do that because they just associate your phone number with your data. We could go do that same thing here. We could save more metadata, and we could, we could query our SQL database, or in this case, our file system database, for all the things that were returned in the last 50 days. And we can just analyze that totally offline in a totally different process that we run on batch every day, every hour, every three hours, whatever we want to build some of the analytics that you're talking about, Derek.\nUm, deterministic or something here.\nExactly.\nDid you have anything to add to that, Dexter? Was that\nNo, I think that makes sense. I mean, I think, I think you're getting the core of it. It's just, like, it's all just code. And so if you own the loop and the control flow, then you can shell data out to other systems whenever you want, you can pull data in. It's not that you can't do that if you're using kind of a more blackboxy framework that kind of, like, wraps up the loop for you and just, like, calls functions without kind of giving you hands into the guts, but, um, it definitely becomes a lot more clear, and you can, I don't know, I think we're in the age with LMs of, like, I think, uh, somebody in the Ruby community wrote this back in, like, 2014. It was, like, duplication is better than the wrong abstraction. Like, having way more code that someone else has already written is better than having an abstraction that gets in your way or makes things more complicated. Exactly. And also, like, code you than code you don't own. Especially in the world of AI, where everything is changing so fast.\nYeah. All right, Obby, what you got?\nYeah, my question is, like, in, in this flow, how many agents do you have, u, or how can we have this, uh, human in the loop system in a, in a group chat with what we have in AG2 or Autogen, or, um, like, a swarm kind of chat, where there are multiple agents communicating with each other, and at every step you want the human intervention. Um, and, you know, like, if it's, how do you, because you can't really terminate a chat and say, like, um, maybe you can terminate the chat and, uh, do that, but you can't really pose, uh, a, a workflow with, uh, with multiple agents working, because then each worker that gets paused during the, uh, the system, like, imagine a thousand customers, uh, using multiple workers, and how, how many things that are on hold. So, like, how do you, how do you, uh, I kind of n\nI think the confusion that you're, uh, the, the place where your question is coming from is from this premise of how these systems are running. You're running all these systems in a black box by these other frameworks that basically run while loops under the hood. Yeah. Okay. Now the problem is you want to go and stop them, and those frameworks don't really give you a good way to stop them.\nExactly. Exactly. And, uh, the only way I can think of is, you know, uh, if, if it's a group chat, have some human intervention, but, uh, basically end, end the group chat and start a new request instead of boils down to the same thing that you have to do. What you have to do is you have to somehow serialize your state. At any point, you should be able\n\n\nTo view the state of the system that you are running. The reason that most people run into problems with these systems is you're not able to view the state. Think about how you do parallel tasks today. Instead of viewing it like an agent, just view every single one of these boxes that Dexter drew on the left as a... No, that one. The other one you were doing. Can you go back? Yeah. Oh, sorry. Zoom. Yeah, the the the one with the web the web. Yeah, that one. This stuff that Dexter wrote over here. Each of these doesn't matter if it's a Y loop or not, right? All that matters is that as long as they're running and I can introspect them and have some way to serialize the state, the state of my system now just becomes a serialized state of all of these together at any given time. And in a multiprocessing job, I'm going to... I'm going to delete my drawings. In a multiprocessing job, how do I go deal with this? Well, I build this way to communicate to each of those workers to pause. I pause it and I do a sync step and I tell them to exit their loop. That's how you do multi-threaded code. So if you want to do multi-threaded code, you got to do multi-threaded code. You tell each of those workers to stop. You get their state, get them to write it into their database. And you have to deal with atomic variables. And you have to deal with locks and contentions and all this stuff that we have to do in multi-threaded code. That doesn't go away. You just now have introduced that. The point is is that if you if you if if the if the internals are a black box, then you don't even have the option to go write that code. Exactly.\n\nThat's kind of why like if you're using Swarm, you're kind of [Â __Â ] I don't know Swarm specifically, but like any most of these frameworks that own the Y loop and don't let you touch the Y loop, you're basically [Â __Â ] because you can't go and stop. You can't go in and stop the loop. So, you just have to wait until the loop is done. Yeah, that's what I said. You know, like have the human intervention agent at the end and end the entire group chat and maybe somehow store the history in a database or something and do another request. But this is what my other question is, yeah, go ahead. But this is what Dexter says so much is like if the only benefit you're getting from there is just running the Y loop just write the damn Y loop and now you can just like that Y loop whenever you want to whenever you want to leave and that will make your life a lot faster and easier.\n\nMy other question is like why do you want this? I know people always talk about like I want multi-agent systems and my question is always why and I'm not saying that useful. Dexter sassy way threading is useful, right? Like I run multi-threaded code all the time. It's part of... I'm talking about multi-threading though. I'm talking about like I guess I guess like the model and like message passing and stuff like that. Exactly, like message passing and running multiple channels in your codebase. Like Go is based on this as a programming language. Go is literally made so we can just send data across channels really fast and really easily. Uh, it's made a whole design pattern around this because you do write this kind of code all the time and agents might benefit from this kind of code. But I think what you're saying is that highQL agents are probably good for 95% of developers because 95% of developers don't write multi-threaded code anyway. So just write the code that you're used to writing instead of trying to blow it up into like a multi-threaded system most of the time.\n\nI guess makes sense.\n\nUm, I want to come back to kind of a little bit like just just one more thing that I wanted to get across. Um, is kind of like something we've been hacking on and thinking about a lot, which is um kind of like after having designed these systems for a really long time. Um, we're kind of working on a... this is a preview, but we're talking about like the agent to human protocol basically, where agents can either contact humans or request approvals. And in this one, like the input is a message and the output is a response. And then so this is like a basic rest-based API and then you also have events from a human. And so your agent can like fire something off and pull for it or you can fire something off and forget about it and wait for an event. Um, but we have these kind of two different classes and then this conversation created one. Um, so you have function call, which is like the, you know, request approval call this function call. Uh, and then you have human contact, which is just like string to string, either whether it's like request more information or I'm done for now or I need clarification or whatever it is. Um, and those can come into your agent. But that's that's kind of just like to close the loop on that server we were building basically. Um, and this can be a million different humans. This can be the manager, the CS manager. This can be the user you're talking to. This can be a hundred different things. But this is this is a thing we're thinking about a lot and um trying to trying to figure out the right interfaces for um and this is the kind of stuff that like I think this should be open source and this should be open protocol and this should be like a thing that everyone can like use and get to and build together, which is why we're building it in the open. Um, and then this implementation of like how to get in touch with humans on Discord and Slack and Microsoft Teams, like no one should [Â __Â ] write that code. That's just a pain in the ass. Yeah. And and I think the key part here... Oh, you stopped screen sharing. You want me to pull it back up? Um... Um, yeah, pull it back up. The key part here I think that we'd like to talk about is like the stuff over here is going to be useful regardless of AI. Like the way if you had to build a process management system where you had to have a human and your customer success bot uh talking at the same time, like customers and your customer success agent, you're going to have to go design this system anyway. The fact that an LM triggers it is just an implementation detail. Like that's the key part to think about. The LM triggering this is an implementation detail. And the thing I think that confuses people the most about LLMs is they treat them like a magic new thing. But LLMs are just functions. They take an an input, in this case a thread, and they spit out one of the types that we want. And we do things based on types. And we know how to deal with things that spit out different types like unions. We have built a lot of software that deals with unions all the time. So like once you think of it that way, it becomes really easy to see what what to do here. And like all the stuff on the right of that is useful regardless of AI. Uh, VJ has a question.\n\nYeah. Hi. Uh, first of all, thanks for giving me this opportunity on this platform. Uh, I'm kind of new to this, so please uh forgive me if my question seems naive or basic. I just wanted to add a thought to what you said by that uh... um, it's basically a way to input nondeterministic uh feedback or inputs or variables or whatever into your business flow. So what you've even demonstrated just now is basically uh a business logic or a way of defining control flow. Uh, which again, my my question was whether how do we draw the line between how much portion of your software is going to be deterministic and how much of that is going to be agent driven. But I think that was not the right question to ask. What was the right way to ask is or the right perception is to actually just look at it as um getting a paragraph or a text or whatever or random input which is nondeterministic versus filling a form of or a page or a CRM or whatever and then just processing it as usual the way you do it uh in your one. Exactly. I think that's like one use case for an outl, but I think like you nailed it.\n\nYeah. The way that I've always thought about this is like LLMs are just an accelerant. Like we could all make Slack take less than 70 gigs of RAM by writing in Rust and making it really damn good. But it turns out no one cares that it's an Electron app that takes 70 gigs of RAM. So why write in Rust? And it's the same with an LLM world. Like, hey, if you you could have someone type out the business form and go do that manually. Or you can use an LM to turn like voice into text with some voodoo magic with a video in there into the form. Great. Then go do that. Especially if it gets you to ship faster, even if it has a 20% failure rate, because it might be better to ship in two days and get to production with a 20% failure rate than to build it out for 9 months perfectly with some LMS and your own custom models and some control flow and then not know it whether it works or not. And LM are just another tool in our software engineering toolbox like a boatload of RAM or bigger GPUs and bigger CPUs that you can just use to accelerate your development cycle and like product iteration speed. Yeah, I think that's great. I think um and and I think this is another lesson I learned over a long time was like a lot of people say, &quot;Oh, AI is here. We're going to do agents.&quot; And they kind of take whatever their project is and they start a brand new that we're going to do agents. We're we have our SAS, we have our product, we have our tool, whatever it is. Now, we got to pull it up and we got to build agents and we're going to start from scratch. We're going to make these seven agents and I have to jump in and be like, &quot;No, like the number one concept, the thing that LM are really freaking good at that creates magic is turning unstructured data into JSON.&quot; And that unstructured data might be JSON or XML or whatever it is, but it's like turning anything into JSON because your code can do something with JSON. And that's where the magic is. And you can pick up these small principles like how do you bring humans in or how do you do your control loop or or how do I construct a prompt? You can do all this stuff in the middle of your existing code. And because and because it's already like the best LLM apps are mostly just code anyways. You should just start sprinkling in more and more magic as you go rather than throwing out the whole thing and be like the way we do software has changed and we're going to do this kind of software now. Like it's all still mostly the same. If you if you look at any of the like founders building AI agents that are making like a 100K plus in revenue, it's all mostly code. Yeah, AI is a small part of it. Uh AJ, last question and then we're going to close it out today. Uh yeah. Um my question is just I guess zooming out a little bit and more just on business use cases. I wanted to get your um thoughts, both of your thoughts on sort of uh I I don't want to call it emergent phenomena, but just sort of emergent things that you've noticed as a result of building these human in the loop agents. Specifically, the question that I have is whether or not building human in the loop agents has allowed um your customers or those people that you're servicing to better map those non-written understandings that exist um in their brains but not uh from the documents that they're that you and your agents and your tools are calling. I'm just trying to get a sense of what like emergent behaviors are happening as a result of having human in the loop.\n\nI think people are willing to give agents access to more risky things. I think people are willing to actually build agents that um that do interesting important stuff that you would never give an agent. I mean like we have users doing it sending emails on behalf of them to their supply chain suppliers and logistics. I've seen people building agents that manage Terraform applies and like there's all these use cases that if you went to any IT manager in the world and you said like hey are LM smart enough to like spin up and tear down AWS infrastructure they would say like absolutely not keep an LLM as far as far away from that stuff as possible. Don't even think about touching it. And now we're seeing people ship developer tools where it's like, &quot;Oh, well, if the agent hits me up in Slack with a Terraform plan and I just review it and I can give feedback like, oh wait, wait, wait, don't upgrade EKS. I was just trying to add a DNS record that can go back to the LLM, it can change the code, it can come back and suddenly you've created this kind of like flipped workflow where rather than me opening the SAS app to go ask an agent to go do something for me, the agent's just always working in the background and coming to me and I feel comfortable giving an access to scary things because I know deterministically I have required that that agent is going to have to go to a human. A human is going to have to click a button. There's no prompt. There's no question about it. a human has to click a button in order to actually uh push that thing through. And I think VJ said something kind of interesting here. It's like I will move my money if a bank views an agent in its core loop. And like we say that now, we do say that now, but I want to pose a paradigm shift that has happened before. Um I used to get a text message before every single time a credit card swiped on every dollar value that it swiped on. And now I get a text message every time I swipe over 500 bucks because like it's just not worth me thinking about uh how every credit every time I buy coffee I need to approve it. That kind of sucks. And like while today we feel that way about agents moving stuff. It's possible that as we all build trust and it doesn't even matter about the capability of the models. It's all about trust building and how software is architected around these systems. Like we didn't used to touch trust digital banking. My parents never trust that a check could be deposited over a phone and taking a picture of it until like they saw it happen for a long time. And some people will build that trust sooner. Some people will build that trust later. But the way we can we as engineers can help build that trust for everyone is by building software that works. By leveraging AI in a way that is reliable, trustworthy, and engaging, we'll earn the right over time to get everyone else to use our software stacks and have agents do stuff with less human in the loop. But still, some stuff will probably want that. Like before I close my bank account and it has a...\n\n\nMillion bucks in it, I want to know that the bank account is being closed and no matter what, no matter how many agents there are, uh, ever happening.\nYep.\nUm, so I think it's just like a paradigm shift that'll happen over time slowly.\nYeah.\nAnd it's continuous, right?\nYou start with like I mean even that refund request workflow, we'd be like, \"Hey, if the amount is greater than $10, then check with a manager otherwise just do it.\"\nAnd you've seen if you've asked for a refund from Amazon, you know, sometimes it's just like, \"Cool, here's a refund.\" like too small for us to care about.\nYeah.\nUm this was super dope everybody.\nThank you so much.\nVibbov, thank you so much for uh helping helping make this happen.\nUm Nico says hello and then we will What's up Nico?\nWe will come back next week with another session that we'll announce pretty soon.\nUm excited to see you all next week.\nThank you for joining today.\nUh another fun time of AI that works with Dexter.\nSuper dope.\nThanks everybody.\nBye everyone.\nSee you.\n",
