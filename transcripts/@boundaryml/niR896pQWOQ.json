  "cleanText": "Um, okay. So a lot of you have been here before, some of you are new. Uh, this is AI that works, where me and Vibb talk about AI that works. Uh, it's a very, uh, straightforward title. Um, my name is Dex. I'm the founder of a company called Human Layer. We help people build better, safer, more interesting, more useful agents. Um, and Vibb, I'll let you do your intro. Cool. I'm Vibb. I'm Vibb. Um, I work on BAML, and if you don't know what BAML is, check it out. It's an interesting way to use LLMs in a way that's kind of fun. With that, yeah, today we're going to talk about entities and entity resolution and deduping and resolving. And um, I think we've got a pretty interesting kind of like, it's, it's kind of a toy use case, but I think it really will demonstrate really well some of the um, kind of core ideas there, and um, will be a fun thing that you can pick up, and we'll try to keep it simple enough that you can pick it up and run with it. Um, this meeting is being put it in your own code, and then um, we will push all the code that we write today as well. All right. So what is entity resolution? What is entity deduping? Um, and how are all these terms kind of related? I think that's the first thing I want to start with over everything else. So, I'm going to screen share. I'm going to talk about uh, entity resolution. I realized I need my mic or my mouse for today.\n\nAll right. Well, he's getting that. Oh, he's back.\n\nAll right. So really quickly, I think a lot of people mix up entity resolution to these smaller problems into a giant problem, and that makes the problem much, much harder. So I'm going to really quickly clarify exactly what we're going to go cover and what we're going to talk about.\n\nSo step one is we always have entities. So we have like some sort of name that we want to extract or some class of names that we want to pull out. So the most common example that I think everyone can relate to is let's say company names. I have a database of people that are registered that I know about that are legal entities of companies, and I want to say that no matter what someone says, I want to pull out that sort of data, and there's different ways that we can go about this problem. So let's take a couple sample names so we all can think about this. So someone might write the word Xbox, someone might write the word MSFT when talking about the stock price ticker. Someone might write the word Microsoft. um, someone might misspell Microsoft, and we might even have other things like um, Microsoft Inc. uh, or whatever they're called. All of these kind of map to the same entity as far as I'm concerned, assuming that I don't care about subsidiaries. I'm going to make that claim right now. And they all kind of map to this entity that I have specifically. This entity isn't just a plain entity. I also often have some ID attached to it in my database that is very, very specific.\n\nAnd what I want to be able to do is somehow get this information out. Now, there's two different problems that exist in here. And we're going to skip. And there's one last problem that we didn't mention, I guess. Uh, enriching. Um, so in this case, we're deduping entities. So no matter what everyone says, we're going to spit out the same ID. We're resolving them to the same exact entity, and we're going to extract this data out of it. So we want to extract from whatever information the model gives us this independent process. Now there are a couple ways that we can go do this. We can prompt our way to trying to do this. We give it the LLM all of the companies, and we say only use this list of companies. Yeah. What's the, what's the naive approach to this? I guess, like what does that look like? Like what similar to like the classification problem, right? Let's write the let's write the function signature because I think that helps.\n\nDef. Yep.\n\nD and we'll we'll assume we're going to extract a single entity for now. We might have multiple, but we'll take that out. Uh, input will be a string and the output will be an entity type. Um, an entity type will have a name stir, which doesn't really matter, and some ID that is like some sort of database ID that does matter. And the most naive way to do this is my function will also take in a uh, list of entities.\n\nAnd I ask super dumb. I just ask LLM to pick one of these. So I can write something like this. Pick best choice equals ask LLM input options. And I'm certain many of us can write a prompt to go do this. This isn't that interesting. The next level of uh, complexity that we can add is we can say now if best choice not in options for some sort of stir match function or some sort of match function that we write return none else best return best choice. So now we've done Go ahead. And this could even be a place where you would incorporate some of those um, the stuff we talked about in the eval episode of like having runtime guards of like Okay, cool. We know for sure that it has to be in this list. So if it's not, we just kind of like add more error context to it and ask the LLM to try again at least once. Yeah. So we could exactly, we could be like, oh, um, we could literally just do it like try again. It's like we could put a thing here. is like num tries equals uh int equals like three by default. Uh if if num tries less than uh greater than zero return. We just recursively call itself, and you should do recursion, but for now um, so we could do this, uh, we could go escalate to a human. We can do all these things that we want to go do in here. But there's a couple other reasons that it might not exist. There are other reasons that it might not exist such as like our entities array itself might be incomplete. Like imagine that in Microsoft case, great. We can we can scrape the S&P 500. We can get all the top businesses that we know about and we pass them into here. But in Microsoft's case, we might actually run into an issue where let's say someone's looking for the company Human Layer. Human Layer probably doesn't exist in most public registries yet. And I say yet, it will in about a year or two. Whoa, buddy.\n\nWe're on Crunch Base. That's true. Um, but uh, if you're on there, you might not find the right entity because it's just missing information. You might want to have an option to enrich data.\n\nSo, you might want to actually consider enriching your options array itself over here and then updating your options array for next time around. And the options for enriching are kind of what you said, Dexter. You could escalate to a human to go enrich it. You can escalate for another pipeline that's completely independent that scrapes the web and searches for everything along that lays and builds a list of candidates and then passes off to a human or does it yourself.\n\nOr you can always just sorry, one more thing, or you can just do the thing that we did in this current code, which says we will do nothing, and we'll just return none in that scenario. So there's it's kind of up to the caller to decide what to do if it's none. Exactly. It's your choice how much rigor you want to have on your pipeline, how much automation you add in this process. But the actual process of entity extraction, as it turns out, like this this method of doing this, I find this to be a little bit easier than um, than even this goes along. And I think actually the best way to show this is code, not even whiteboarding. Uh, because it's surprisingly very, very straightforward. So let's just go ahead into the AI that works repo. Um, cd repos get pull just in case pull drease. Okay, clear. Okay. Um, ls maker 2025 06 17 uh, entity extraction let's see cool uh, uv init and then uv add baml-py oops uv we run baml cli test sorry, we do this usually ahead of time, but Oh, it all right. It's good. This demonstrates how easy it is to do this. And while he's doing that, Derrick, you had a question?\n\nYeah, I was just gonna maybe if it, if I could take the liberty to add like a use case in real world where I've done this kind of with TF diff and Excel as human in the loop when it didn't get above a threshold match, which now I can see these identified pipelines being another level. So I tried to take like a deterministic approach with a threshold first and then fall back to like this type of thing. Anyway, long story short was a Barnes & Noble Digital Nook. They they had like so many uh, contracts with Adobe. And so they had a a database of contracts of 10,000 contracts they had that they some of them were were weren't assigned to people. Some they were paying and not using. And uh, we did this process to align all of the Adobe Adobe systems, Adobe, you know, into basically Adobe products and Adobe consulting and literally took like it turned out there were 40 kind of unique like contracts under different things that weren't visible and brought them all into those two categories. So they had a total aggregate view of their Adobe spend. They found the ones that had no owner and that they could actually save, and that like five or 10 minutes paid for our project. Nice. Um, so I just wanted to mention this is like type of things that you could use this, and I could give other examples. Uh, yeah, I think resolving something to the same shared ID is generally useful when things have many, many multitudes of inputs. It's a very, very general problem, and I think the problem that we're going to talk about today is one that should be obvious to everyone, which is like resumes. Obviously, if I have a Caner database, how many of you use some ATS system and you just want to search for the person that works in my shop at Amazon? Like people wrote like AWS or something else that isn't really relevant, but really I just want to search for all employees of Amazon. I know when we go and hire people, we always look for people by candidate references of different companies, different backgrounds, different skill sets. Like for example, I wrote CV engineer, but I just want to look for people that have computer vision expertise. that's going to be hard to go find unless I can do some sort of resistant entity resolution. Like skills tags are another example of where you want to do entity resolution. You want some level of entities that are well known, well established, and highly useful. And you also want to have adaptability of that. For example, in this case, Boundary ML should be its own entity, but likely that a database won't have that on day zero. So, I want to be able to track and amend my entities database while I go do this. And that part is the part I think that makes this problem so interesting and so fascinating. It's not merely by extracting.\n\nIt's about how do you build and maintain an entity database that is changing ever so often all all the time. And I think that's the problem that we should dive into today. Cool.\n\nWell, let's look at this code. So in this case, I have something really, really simple. I have a thing that is a functional extract resume. It's going to extract a resume from uh, this place, and we're just going to have experiences. But now I want to go do this. I'm going to go add some um, test cases really fast just so I know because I know that this is going to be a problem. I want this to be Microsoft obviously. Um, I'll put like GCP. Uh, and hopefully we'll figure out what it figures out on there. Um, and I specifically left ambiguous uh, ambiguous uh, so I know what it is. Um, and now let's go play around with this. Obviously, if I go do this, it's not going to work off the top of my off the top of my head. If I just say like at description get the real company name legal legals name. Uh, let's run this. And like it did some stuff. It did Alphabet Inc., it did Microsoft. And like if I spin it down to GPT4 mini, who knows? Maybe this will work, maybe it won't. It kind of did, but there's no guarantee. I'm really relying on the vibes of the LM to hope that I get this correct. And I think that's the thing that we should go up take upscale a little bit. So let's just make this an experience data model. And I'm just going to focus on company and title. I won't even add anything else. Description. I don't need this. The legal company name. And this will kind of work I think, but it really didn't like Google isn't actually a legal company name. Neither is my shop. It's actually like my shop inc or something else. So let's make another object in here to help the model really understand what we mean. Name as verbatim batum from content. uh, legal name um is subsidiary. Let's just know if it's a subsidiary really fast. Mhm. And let's run this. Cool. Uh, it pulled this out. This is for viob resume. Let's run the other test case now, the ambiguous one, and see what it does. The ambiguous test case, you remember, has boundary ML, GCP, and Xbox. GCP legal name Xbox, and it, it's really not understanding what I want. So let's do the first thing and just like beef up the model. Uh, really not understanding what I want either. Um, name I'm telling you man peak peak working hours they make all the models dumber. It's my new conspiracy theory. Uh, let's get rid of is subsidiary, and then let's ask legal name. What I want to know is if available best guess at the legal name of the company, and we might find that we actually it's interesting, right? We immediately got Microsoft Corporation, Google LLC, and Boundary ML Inc., which is not the real name. So now let's go over here. Company type uh, well established, well-known uh, startup because those are really the two established companies that I might have. So let's just go and establish this. Yeah, because you kind of and that's basically you're helping to filter between like how likely is this to be something that the model made up? Because if the model doesn't pick well known, then it's more likely that it's not in the training set, basically, right? or owning exactly, and now we're noticing it's listing on Google cloud platform, um, and then we can say we can add more uh, well, let's add another one known subsidiary, which I think is good over here if If well known of the owning company. So let's read my prompt really fast. What I have out\n\n\nHere:\n\nI changed my data model.\nThe name I still want to be verbatim from the content.\nThen I want it to tell me what company type I am.\nI'm either well-known, a well-known subsidiary, or a startup.\nAnd then I want to tell me in the legal name, I want it to actually tell me if it's well-known, best guess of the legal name of the company.\nIf it's a well-known subsidiary, best case of the owning company.\nSo I'm actually being very deliberate with the actual model itself.\nAnd I'm actually going to make this an optional field because in the case of a startup, I don't want to spit out a legal name.\nSkip if startup.\nOkay.\nSo this is almost like forcing a very specific flavor of reasoning onto the extraction process.\nExactly.\nAnd you can see now the model is actually like kind of understanding what I want to do a lot better.\nUm and it's actually spinning out what I want.\nNow this is only half the battle because at this point I now have something.\nLet's just see if GP4 mini works really fast.\nWhy not?\nRight.\nThis doesn't let you leverage your database of named entities and it doesn't let you evolve the database over time.\nExactly.\nAnd we can see that hey GCP uh a well-known um what's it called well-known subsidiary is probably not working as well uh or like uh like GCP isn't working as well in G uh GP uh GP 40 because 40 Mini still says Google Cloud Platform.\nYeah, but that's okay.\nWe actually don't want to worry about that too much because we could spend forever prompting this or we can add a multi-faceted approach to go solve this problem.\nCool.\nSo let's take a look at what that approach would look like.\nSo now what we're going to do is do something like this.\nUm, I'll put I'll put a real example here.\nUm, I'll just take this example.\nAs I said, also be interesting to see this with like the actual raw text from like a real resume rather than this little like fake markdown thing.\nI will Yeah, I'll do that in a second.\nUm, I just think it's I like to use toy examples because then we don't have to all digest all the examples at first.\nYeah, like resume equals this.\nCool.\nSo now we have a resume and what we're going to do now is we're actually going to go access all the experiences for company in for EXP exp.\nNo, there's a company type.\nOh, I have to set up my UV environment.\nU packetic.\nThis is a company type for company dot uh let's say legal name.\nSo I want to first get the legal name.\nSo I'm going to do a couple of things um and be like uh in uh extract companies in here.\nSo company exp.\nOkay.\nWhat I'm going to do over here is first I'm going to go ahead and actually get the actual type of the company.\nmatch exp type case uh startup I don't really care and I'll just like print it out and I don't really want to do anything uh I don't actually know if I have to break I might have to okay do nothing in fact I might even want to do one more thing where I like specifically will set the legal name of the company explicitly to none because I do not want in the case of a startup, even if the LLM hallucinates something, I'm just going to ignore it.\nIt doesn't matter to me.\nIt's like it's garbage data.\nIf it's a well-known company, um I'm going to see if it has a legal name.\nUh if it if it does if it doesn't have a legal name and it's a well-known company, I might figure out um to do ask an LLM else.\nNow if I have to go do this now I want to do the next thing which is validate names which I will do is like validate company which I'll take in the exp company itself and I want to go validate this somehow.\nNow what I will do over here is write a validate function.\nThere you go.\nAnd the way I'll validate this is I'll assume that I have a list of companies def load companies.\nUm, and what this will return is this will return a list of tupils.\nOops.\nOf like name, comma, like legal name or like maybe I'll what I'll do is actually something slightly different.\nSorry.\nlegal name and then also return a list of actual descriptions about that company.\nSo in the case of Go ahead.\nAre we going to end up doing something similar to what we did in the classification where we kind of have a a internal class that our program manages and controls the view that is like what the database sees versus what the LLM sees versus what the what the code sees.\nExactly.\nIt's a very very similar pattern but it's slightly different.\nIn the case of what I will be doing here is I'll say like company valid equals load companies valid companies both this and then for valid company invalid companies I'm going to just see if the legal name of this thing that I have over here matches this.\nIf the legal name is coming in my database I am good.\nThat doesn't Okay.\nSo, so it's almost like a a group by where you have the where you have like an index from legal name to all of the known company names basically.\nExactly.\nExactly.\nAnd in the case of me not finding some valid company that I like, then what I will do after this is now I need to to do ask an LLM to update uh ask an LLM to uh update the company to find.\nYeah, you have a lot of ask LLMs in here and I'm not they seem to be different things in different parts of the workflow.\nYeah.\nSo, I'm just writing to-do comments here.\nBut what I want to do is I'm just going to load all the companies from my database and if I find if I find one it matches the legal names that I am aware of in my database, I'm good.\nIf I'm unable to find one, then what I want to do is I want to ask the LLM.\nSo in this case, it's been out Google Cloud Platform.\nSo I literally just dump the valid companies into my uh LLM and ask them to pick one.\nI basically turn this problem into a classification problem.\nWhy not just dump the list of valid companies in any like at the start in the original prompt?\nWell, a couple of reasons for that and I think that's a really really good question.\nWell, one of them is I can get a good bang for my buck without doing that.\nLike I see you use the cheap model with a small prompt and like a lot of times it will just get it right.\nExactly.\nAnd then if you're if you're any reasonably sized company, your ATS of legal companies that you're going to be hiring from is going to be massive.\nJust has to be by definition.\nSo instead, okay, so you're you're just like pre-optimizing this basically, right?\nlike our our normal advice is like use the biggest model and the biggest prompt and the most powerful thing first and then break it down when it becomes a performance bottleneck.\nBut in this case, you're just saying like I'm going to actually start with a smaller tighter tighter model and then zoom back out to a bigger model if I don't find something that kind of matches my expectations.\nYes.\nAnd then one last caveat is that like I can't actually put together my actual um I can't fit all the companies I know about into the prompt.\nI know that from the get.\nI see.\nYeah.\nRight.\nLike we all know that from the very beginning.\nWe can't do that.\nLike for this problem of extracting resumes.\nIt's not possible for the PDF contract problem.\nIt's not possible to put all the contracts into most problem that have an entity resolution problem can't do this on day one.\nYou can't just put it all in a prompt.\nThat's actually a much better answer.\nYeah.\nSo like it it kind of it would be wasteful for me to go even write the base prompt because it it I know up front by definition of the problem, I can't do it.\nCool.\nAnd so I imagine there's some stage where we kind of like if we if we do want to push them in, we would narrow down the set that we pass into the LM.\nExactly.\nAnd that's literally what we do over here.\nWe do the same thing we did in the classification problem.\nThis is basically this is a classification problem.\nCool.\nOkay.\nAt this point, because all I'm doing is I'm taking the legal name of the company like Google Cloud Platform and trying to classify it against the known companies and we all know how to do classification problems.\nThere's many different approaches.\nOne example is we just dump all the companies into there.\nAnother example is we go ahead and go do the whole thing.\nSo it's really up to us how we go about this problem.\nBut this basically becomes a classification problem at this point.\nAnd in the case, the only difference is now I'm allowed to return other or like no company found.\nAnd if I find no company found, then I have a choice of what I do at this point.\nThis Okay.\nSo, we're actually going to kind of like skip over that classification part and just zoom out and look at the B bigger broader pipeline.\nRight.\nExactly.\nBecause there's no point in rewriting that process again.\nUm I think if someone is interested they can go look at the classification video we did a couple weeks back and just know we will put a we'll put a link to that in the uh in the show notes.\nYeah.\nUh but like once you do the classification refer to video.\nUm once you do that then you're basically able to go move on.\nNow you have a valid company.\nNow the problem is this won't always return a valid company.\nSometimes it'll return something not found.\nSo we want to go update this and make this a little bit better for ourselves.\nSo sometimes we'll return this otherwise we'll return none for now.\nVery simplistic.\nNow what we want to do over here is I need to enumerate this.\nIf uh result equals this, if result is none, if the result is none, then I kind of want to val invalidate the company and mark it as such.\nOtherwise, I'm okay leaving it as that.\nI kind of want to say this legal name is not valid.\nSo even because the legal name is what you're going to use to map that's like you're using that as a proxy to the database ID basically.\nExactly.\nExactly.\nI'm using this as a database ID.\nSo if I'm unable to find a valid company for this legal name, I'm going to go and like just not care about it.\nIf I am able to find a valid legal name, then I'll go do this.\nAnd in this classification problem, what I do is like I'd call an LLM.\nIf it found a valid legal name, I would just change the legal name of the object that I have and return it back.\nCool.\nCool.\nSo now I have this.\nI'm able to go do this.\nNow there's a couple scenarios in here that all that all fail.\nSame with the legal name over here.\nThis is also like classified.\nSo like let me just write a function really fast.\nClass pick potential uh name company uh uh content stir and what this will return is like a stir or none passed.\nSo what is the content that got that gets passed in there?\nExactly.\nSo what I would do is I'd pass into here potential company.name.leal name.\nSo I pass in the legal name of the company and ask it that if return company.leal name equal potential company uh return company.\nSo this is what I I think this I keep getting tripped up by the tupils.\nAre you down to put a couple like actual examples in there instead of like the names of the columns?\nThat's a good idea.\nMicrosoft Corporation, uh, Xbox, uh, Xbox, Azure, um, MSFT, and maybe there should be a dictionary.\nMaybe that'll be easier.\nSure.\nUh, there we go.\nCool.\nUh, Google does not own GitHub.\nUm, this is like one example of companies.\nSorry about that.\nGood call on that.\nUm it items valid company.\nUm cool.\nThere we go.\nCool.\nAll right.\nSo now what I would do is I just pass in legal name.\nI pick the uh potential company.\nAnd what I can do over here is like or legal name and how many and I just return this.\nSo now I'm doing something very very simple, very simple, which is I just see if any of the aliases match the content and if they do then I'll return the legal name.\nThis could be an LM function but I'm choosing to use a very basic heristic here instead.\nDoes that make sense Dexter?\nYeah.\nSo so this content is really like a like company name.\nYeah.\nWhich one?\nThis one.\nSo I mean we use content in the main function and in that case content is like the source of the resume.\nI just I don't want to mix up those we're going to do something over here.\nSo in this scenario where the legal name wasn't provided for a company then we're going to do this potential but it's not the full resume it's the company.name.\nExactly.\nSo if the legal name is none I'm going to pick a potential company by passing in the legal name.\nSo I guess my point was like in pick potential company should that v variable be called company name?\nUh it's not always going to be the company name because in different places I'm passing different things in the valid where I have a valid company.\nI'm going to pass in the legal name.\nIn the case of where the legal name was not filled out by the LLM, I'm going to pass in the actual name of the company verbatim from the resume.\nOkay?\nUsing different things to go do this.\nAnd you can imagine that I pass in like different piece of content.\nI might pass in the whole experience block into here.\nIt's really up to me as a developer to decide what I want to go do.\nBut the goal of this function is to say given some string, tell me all the relevant pieces of content that might match that company.\nAnd if I have it, then I update my company name into here.\nNow, the nice thing that I'm able to do about all this is I'm also invalidating names that come back to me from the LM.\nIf the LM gives me a name, I'm invalidating it if it's not valid.\nIn addition to that, I also am going to go ahead and do the same thing with subsidiaries.\nI'll do the exact same thing.\nSo, I'll just like put this over here.\nOh, I can't do that in Python.\nI didn't know that.\nOkay.\nYou might be able to use an or something.\nUm Oh, maybe.\nOh, I can.\nNice.\nI didn't know that.\nCool.\nMatch is pretty freaking cool.\nUm, so now I can actually go do this and I can handle the scenario really nicely.\nNow I can build a Now that I've done this, I basically have a pipeline that is able to go ahead and validate all sorts of things in here.\nLet's go run this really fast.\nUm, I'm\n\n\nActually going to make the problem a little bit simpler and change what model I used to be a very, very bad model.\nLlama latest.\nI don't know if this will work, but it might.\nOh, LSV, run python-fellow.\nMhm.\nThere we go.\nSo, I'm going to go run this with an Oama model really fast and see what happens.\nMy old might not be out.\nOops.\nUh, there we go.\nOkay, there you go.\nSomething happens.\nSo, the model Oh, I forgot to print out stuff.\nThat's funny.\nUm, let's go ahead and go print this out.\nPrint.\nThere you go.\nThat's what I wanted.\nAnd I'm also going to print out the response ahead of time.\nUh, before and then after enriching.\nAfter.\nOkay.\nUm, and then BMA log equals Oh.\nOh, this can't actually happen.\nThat's cool.\nPython yells at me.\nUm, so now we can see what happens before.\nSo before we have boundary ML null, um, the Google Cloud Platform subsidiary of Alphabet, and then this thing did actually not do this.\nI might have to debug this a little bit really fast.\nUm, this thing did not get enriched.\nUh, let's see what happened.\nWell-known subsidiary should have gone into here.\nExpco company name.\nUh, let me print this out.\nYou could just tell cursor agent to add a bunch of print statements.\nThat's probably true.\nAdd some debug print statements.\nOkay.\nWell, it does this.\nDid it do it?\nCommand ki.\nThis is the only problem with AI generate code.\nIt takes a while to write.\nLet's just go for it.\nBeautiful.\nWe're gonna have a lot of print statements.\nUm, have you ever used the cursor debugger that lets you like step through Python code?\nNo, I haven't.\nIt's uh sometimes pretty good.\nUh, company type of startup.\nDid I make something silly and not actually go through every company?\nOh, I see.\nI didn't know Python this break actually breaks out of the loop.\nOut of the loop.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI don't think you want that.\nOkay, let's get rid of more debug statements.\nI want to go run this.\nSo now when we're able to go do this in theory, um, this should null out the actual legal name of the GCP because it didn't actually work.\nOkay, so this is just detecting which ones can you accurately extract.\nThis is, and then after that you could do another pass to go try to ask an LLM to better pick or do a lookup or do a rag against the list or something like that.\nExactly.\nAnd now we can actually go further and say if the result is none, what I can say is like other names, other names equals pick potential, uh, sorry, let's go to validate company.\nWhat I can say here is if this is none, what I also want to do is another option, uh, from name equals pick, and then I just return this.\nSo, if I, if the actual legal name doesn't find it, then I'll also try from the original name that I got from the LLM when I'm validating a company, and we'll see what this does.\nSo, the goal here is to say that there are many ways that I could enrich it.\nYou can see right over here I was able to enrich it to Google now because what I said was, oh, even if the LLM doesn't initially get a good legal name, which it did not, it got Google Cloud Platform.\nWhat I will do is I will go ahead and try and find a good match.\nIf I am unable to find a good match from the legal name, I'll try the original name in my database and see if I can go find it.\nSo you see we're going to go check, does the original name match one of the aliases?\nSpace.\nExactly.\nMatch one of the aliases.\nAnd this is again the most simplistic algorithm that I could implement here.\nI could do something more sophisticated here such as calling an LLM, asking another model to go save things, um, or go do something.\nBut now this is still only half of the battle.\nI'm still not done yet because we have Boundary ML.\nBoundary ML is clearly not going to be found in my database.\nSo what I need to do is I almost need to build a totally separate workflow to solve for that problem.\nAnd the best way Yeah.\nAnd you could, you could almost do something agentic.\nI, I, I want to hear what you were going to say, but I was like, you can almost do something agentic here where it's like there's a LLM is picking a tool that is like actually the next step is to update our list of companies because of some input or some human input or whatever it is.\nYeah, I may not even need, uh, like really I might just know that hey, if it's a startup, I always need to do an agentic workflow and I might want to maintain my list of startups separately than my list of well-known companies or even mark these as startups versus well-known companies.\nSo then what I could do now is like build a database pipeline that says as soon as I save a data into there, I push something to an SQSQ that says go look up information about Boundary ML and here's database IDs that could be impacted by Boundary ML.\nSo if you find a company called Boundary ML in the cloud somewhere.\nSo let's, let's go back to our whiteboard.\nUh, where do they go?\nSo now the next step now that we have this pipeline where we're pretty good about legally known companies that we have in our database.\nNow we have a separate thing.\nNow what we're going to do is we're going to create an AWS SQSQ that's going to do a couple of things.\nIt's going to submit a job that says look for info on boundary ML.\nAlso, by the way, the row ID that I just inserted is equal to like, uh, like 50, uh, 51.\nAnd then So, your goal is basically you're going to, you're going to put in what you extracted and then you're going to say like, &quot;Hey, we need to get a legal name for this company.&quot;\nExactly.\nSo, I'm going to give it, I'm going to give it, give it the information I extracted.\nI might even give it the raw resume.\nSomething else that I might want to give it just to give it more context on it.\nI might want to give it the full resume, the original text or whatever I have.\nBut specifically, I'm going to tell it I care about I care about this company Boundary ML in this resume.\nSo now I can build a pipeline whose job it is to first say give me everything, every clue from the resume about boundary ML.\nWhoops.\nAnd this becomes again a very simple prompt that we can go do.\nNow I can use web search or some other tool that I want uh to go find all the relevant information.\nThen I can build a whole Go ahead.\nOkay.\nSo you would use those clues you extracted from the resume to build good web searches.\nBasically it's like basically like if you didn't know Boundary ML was an AI dev tools company.\nMaybe you could figure that out from the resume and then you would look search for BAML AI instead of searching just BAML and getting a bunch of things about Bank of America.\nExactly.\nOr I might have the location of the person and where they live on or go do something like that.\nI might find all sorts of clues that might give me information about that.\nThen you can make a bunch of search queries, build a web search pipeline, and at some point this thing will end.\nIt'll put together a proposal or it'll put together no proposal.\nIt's really up to you.\nAnd now now that we have a proposal, we have our list of databases.\nThis becomes an entry into there with a status of proposed instead of committed.\nAnd it is some other agent's job to migrate us from proposed to committed.\nNow I see, and that might be human input.\nThat might be more searches against the database.\nYou, you decide the logic for what lets you commit a new entity to the database.\nExactly.\nUh, information.\nRight.\nIf you're, if you're doing this for tax information, you want to probably have a human in the loop.\nIf you're doing this for like resume ATS information, it's just like small enrichment for like making searches better.\nAutomate that sucker.\nIt doesn't matter.\nYou might even want to go straight to committed in that scenario.\nIt's up to you, right?\nI mean, it's also like you there's two kinds of human in the loop, right?\nThere's human the loop like do not commit this until someone has reviewed it and then there's like commit it and then anyone has the ability to come back later and edit it and update it.\nRight.\nExactly.\nExactly.\nAnd we can just email our Slack channel saying we added a new company.\nGo review it pre, uh, whenever you have time.\nYeah.\nThat async or batch human in the loop.\nExactly.\nAnd all of this whole thing just becomes like a workflow that we've built out.\nAnd now we have this other last piece of information which is row ID 51.\nOnce it becomes committed, what I need to do is I need to go to the other database where I've stored this information and then right because you have two tables.\nYou have tables of like your abstractions, your extractions that are like in progress or pending and then you have the lookup table of all the companies you know.\nExactly.\nAnd now update row 51 for boundary.\nThat's it.\nOnce that is committed, and now we've actually built a pipeline in a fully automated way or as automated as this process is for proposed to committed that can go find information, do web search, and then go figure this out.\nUm, before we go into the next part of it, any questions from anyone, you can type in the chat or raise your hand uh and come on.\nI guess my question is like is there a zooming out here bigger?\nLike is there like what, what, what else is here?\nHonestly, this is it.\nI've seen this work a couple of places for different couple of different companies.\nThis works for all sorts of processes.\nSo like another process that doesn't sound the same but is exactly the same is topic clustering.\nSo if you think about what topic clustering is, let's say I want to have like the most semantic mill, let's say I'm building like a giant news media company and I want to know what topics are sensational in the world that I should talk about right now.\nThat's basically the same pipeline.\nI have a bunch of data because a topic is an entity with like an official thing.\nExactly.\nWhat if I was making a tool to like label all my Gmails for me?\nIt's same thing.\nI want to go do the same thing.\nUm, and go do that.\nSo, you don't have to really think about any of those concept because those labels are entities and you want to you don't want to make new labels all the time.\nYou want to resolve them to the same labels whenever possible.\nWe got a question.\nCan Sorry.\nGo ahead.\nUh, and you can also do interesting things with like not just labels but also with um, hierarchal labels.\nSo you can have like topics that are like saying like we want to go up down up down and you can go figure that out uh along the way.\nSo it's like do I want the higher level category or the lower level category?\nIt's up to me and all of that is almost the same problem.\nSo in the case like news media, I might want to say like have global news and have like Britain news or like US news and those could be hierarchal design or where I look for global news first and then I find the subcategories around it that are around like environmental stuff or um uh environmental stuff or like financial news under global news or I can go straight to financial news or global news or uh financial stuff or environmental notes along the way.\nYeah, the multi- multi-entity grouping is kind of tricky where something could have multiple different categories and like there's it's one of n instead of exactly one company, then you just return an array and it's the same.\nAnd then you can run through the same validation checks on each thing in the array.\nExactly.\nIf you, if we're doing multilel thing, it's actually really easy.\nAll we do is let's go do this really fast.\nI'm going to turn on my Python type checker so we can see how we actually catch these bugs.\nUh, um, oh, let's add this in here.\nSorry, static analysis is very important to me.\nUm, so now that we go down here, let's go ahead and like add this in our way.\nSo what, what do I do over here?\nWell, maybe there are multiple legal names that make sense.\nSo let's make this an array.\nLet's pretend you worked at Palunteer and you consulted for six companies, but it was one experience.\nExactly.\nNow what I have to do here is this will return instead of a string.\nI mean this can still return a string because this is just like for content.\nUh, legal name company.leal name.\nWe have a bunch of questions stacking up by the way.\nUm, sorry.\nNo, you're good.\nYou're good.\nI didn't want to interrupt you.\nUm, so uh, I just, I just want to do if you're uh, if you're let me do this one, all we have to do here is now we just make this a for loop and we have to do the same kind of code wrapping to make this a for loop and then we might want to resolve the same if the for loop for some reason dumped out like GCP, G Google Cloud Platform, we want to resolve them both to one entry called Google.\nThat's the only other you have to Oh, and then you end up flattening the the list.\nExactly.\nIt doesn't flatten the list.\nExactly.\nThat's all that.\nUm, cool.\nUm, cool.\nUh, um, can BAML use lower level models like BERT or Alberta?\nUm, right now we have just LM support, but uh, you can if you wrap BERT or Alberta around an LM API, uh, which I don't think you can because they're just embedding models really then, uh, for now.\nBut eventually, yeah.\nYeah, Michaela has a really cool example of like if if the Baml run didn't didn't return return like null for one of the fields, they would go do a web search with Tavali and then just pass that context in.\nThat's it sounds like they they naturally discovered the same process we just discovered today, which is like if you got an empty field, which is in this case got this data out of here, you just run web search and do the same thing again.\nThat's kind of cool.\nYep.\nUm, okay, when does the database pipeline get triggered?\nRight after the ML pipeline or was that from one of the BAML functions?\nOh, the database pipeline would get triggered right over here.\nSo, what I can do now is I can say like uh at the very end of the code.\nLet's actually write that out.\nYeah.\nIt's like Yeah, exactly.\nIt's like you you exit the loop, you've done all the repairs you can, then you find the ones that didn't get satisfied and you go kick off jobs, right?\nExactly.\nIs none, then\n\n\nI just kick off a job.\nIs none.\nPrint, uh, kick off AWS, uh, kick off job to find a better match.\nSo now I can go do this, and this is when I would go do this at the very, very end of this.\nCool.\nUm, propose to committed is a bit vague.\nYou're updating data in a database in prod for the company info search results, but AI could commit on wrongful information.\nYeah.\nSo, that's what we talked about is like you need to, uh, look at your risk and and your use case, and you may want to have kind of human in the loop, or you may want to have it push it to like a stage database that gets reviewed regularly and it gets queried.\nExactly.\nYou can view your SQL table for this company information table to look something like this.\nLike you have like a table called like company, uh, name, company, uh, uh, like ID, company attributes, like other keywords or something that you might want to have about it.\nKeyword, you could have a, I guess, like you could have a flag that like whether it was human reviewed or like how, how hard committed it was, right?\nAnd then you'd basically have like company.status, company.status, and status would be one of like, uh, like, uh, proposed, uh, ready.\nYeah.\nAnd you could even store the like human comment or whatever it is.\nAnd you could actually asynchronously go through with an LLM and try to repair this.\nLike if a human said, \"No, that's wrong.\"\nLike go search for this that you could, you could kick off new jobs periodically based on that.\nIt's really important that your data model represent the complexity of your problem.\nSo if you need multiple drafts of a company before you can get to a good resolution, you need a data model that can go do that, and this is independent of an LLM.\nLike this is even like if in Wikipedia, for example, they keep track of every edit that every human makes so they can roll them back really easily.\nThat's what we do with git.\nYou just need to find the right data model that represents the complexity of your task.\nSo in this case, I did something very, very basic where I only have two booleans, proposed and ready.\nAnd I can make a web UI that literally shows everyone on my, at my company internal dashboards a view of these tables, and people can manually promote, promote, promote.\nAnd I can have like a last updated column on top of here is like, um, last updated that I sort by.\nSo in the UI, people can go see this, and I can have information about who the last person that updated was, or I can do what Dexter says and keep a full edit log of the entire edit history of that row and go make that possible as well.\nIt's up to me as the developer of this application to decide the requirements for this task.\nAnd this is what we always say is it's, it's mostly engineering.\nIf you can do the software engineering behind this, you can build the tool that fits your problem, and it's going to work a lot better than one of these like one-size-fits-all, just like rag against a thing and push it in and hope it works.\nYes.\nDoes that answer your question?\nSure.\nYes.\nVery cool.\nUh, I, I really like Sean's question.\nI was wondering if you'd be down to come off mute and kind of clarify a little bit more what you're thinking about.\nUm, how do I think about performances of large numbers of these matches?\nI guess for if you're going to classify emails, you could have 10,000 plus calls.\nYeah.\nCan you hear me?\nOkay.\nYep.\nI'm actually on the the train at the moment.\nSo the, um, yeah, there's that N plus one thing.\nIf I have lots of emails, I want to, you know, maybe I would think about batching them.\nUm, or training smaller models on my custom task, you know, would be how I'd want to do it in production potentially if I have lots of similarly structured documents.\nSo just kind of curious your general philosophy on using LLMs in your BAML framework, and like am I just kind of being old school and worrying about that or just like just do the API calls and and move on or should I be thinking about something else here?\nYeah.\nUm, well, just as, uh, just as I think we say a lot of times, like this stuff is pretty much just functions.\nSo in this case, we have like a type signature.\nThe thing that implements this type signature could be a really, really complicated model like 04 that we toss at it.\nIt could be GVD26, who knows?\nUm, it could be a very tiny model that we've custom trained to actually take a specific content and then spit out the actual company that we have trained on.\nIt can only output valid companies, nothing else.\nIt could be a really, really cheap heuristic like the one I wrote here that just matches on aliases.\nSo that becomes your prerogative.\nBut the most important thing is you just need to collect data on what makes this function really good.\nWhat makes this type signature perform accurately.\nSo once you have large scales of problems like, and there's different ways when you use the word performance.\nIf you're thinking about speed and cost and latency, then yeah, the answer is try not to use an LLM, right?\nA really dumb heuristic.\nNow the problem is this heuristic might not balance very well for accuracy.\nSo you might need to use a bigger model.\nSo then you try a GPD, try like the 54 models like I was trying right now.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then bump it up to 04 because so you can just ship the prod and not have to write 5,000 lines of code trying to optimize your model away.\nAnd then collect data, use that data to go train a tiny model, eval it against your system by having a benchmark because this system can be benchmarked with an F1 score.\nSo we can get a numerical benchmark on this and then just run that in a loop until you have a type signature that meets the constraints of your problem.\nBut it's really about thinking of it as type signatures, and once you think of it that way, then you choose what part of the system you want to optimize as a developer.\nDoes that answer the question?\nYeah, I love that.\nUm, very compelling part of the whole stack.\nThe, uh, the kind of last little follow up is my natural language.\nUh, you're going to have to type that out.\nYour audio is cutting out.\nStep and then linking step, and you're kind of doing it as a oneshot sort of thing here.\nOkay, I'll let him type it out while he goes, and that's it.\nUm, Dexter, is that kind of how you think about optimization as well?\nUm, yeah, I mean I think that tracks.\nI mean, I'm still always all about this like use the, it's like what we did on the the policy to props episode, right?\nIt's like take a subset, work through, iterate on a small subset of a hundred, and then move up to a thousand and understand the performance, and like at the end of the day, yes, if you want AI to do the work, then like you're going to have to spend the tokens to go do the work on all the things, but like iterate and get it tight on a small subset, figure out, learn what you can do with smaller models before you like 10x the number of records you're, you're processing on each run.\nYeah, I agree.\nI agree.\nI think that's a general philosophy as well.\nUm, while we wait for Sean's question, um, if anyone else has more questions, feel free to type them out in the chat.\nI'm going to show you how to do some of the enrichment tasks that we had like handwaved away if that's useful.\nFunction, uh, extract, uh, company clues, uh, resume string, uh, content, uh, company target company string.\nOkay.\nUm, given this resume, tell me all the clues that may help me find information about the company, target company.\nYeah.\nOr you could even just have it output like queries for web search.\nSo, I will do that in a second, but I'm going to go break this up.\nUm, so I'm going to go run this in a very, very basic format, and like let's go do this, company clues, resume, target company, uh, Boundary ML, and what's interesting about this is because I know that extract company clues will only ever be run on like large, smaller companies, I build my test cases like that accordingly as well.\nI don't actually build my test case.\nI have Google.\nI don't care because the input to this function is guaranteed by my software layer by the API definition of I have of how I'm using this function that the scope is only ever going to be unknown companies.\nNow, that scope can change like in regular software.\nYour function can suddenly be used for concepts they're not used to.\nAnd you just have to keep that in mind.\nSo, you might want to drop a comment to let people know.\nBut let's go run this and see what it does.\nYep.\nUm, so it's giving me a bunch of clues.\nUh, this is not very good.\nU, let's go do this.\nUh, and go do this here.\nClass clues, uh, clues string array.\nUh, good searches.\nGood.\nGoogle searches string array.\nWe'll change the data type here to be a little bit better.\nAnd I'm doing this in one shot.\nAnd that's kind of interesting over here.\nSo now it's like, and it's interesting.\nIt actually says, oh, it might Boundary ML might be doing computer vision stuff.\nIt might be C++ and Rust might be parts of Boundary ML stack.\nAnd now you can, it actually gives me pretty good information about how to go find this.\nWhat is your target company?\nOkay, so it's, it's still asking about the other things.\nInteresting.\nWell, it might because that might still be a good search in terms of what it is.\nSo, let's make this better because I think you're getting ambiguity on here.\nClass search, uh, like, uh, priority, I may, based on which queries I should run first.\nOh, cool.\nAnd then you can do like a group buy and run them in in batches.\nExactly.\nThen I just run all my queries that are high first, and like this is probably a good query by Gupta, foundry founder of mail, that'll probably get you to the legal name of our company.\nUm, found it, and it's just like helping you go do this, and like I would go just build a, now we can imagine how to build a pipeline off of, you can go iterate on that prompt and test this and be like, oh hey, you're a expert researcher, whatever, whatever prompt tricks you want to use.\nExactly.\nUh, and then you can toss web search at it.\nYou can do whatever you want, and you can find information about this.\nUh, tell me clues that may help me find information.\nSpecifically, I want to find the legal name of the company.\nAnd I can like prompt my way through this and just see what it does.\nAnd now you can see the that the queries got a lot better.\nAnd it's actually really funny what the queries are doing.\nIt's actually giving me like search queries of like who is patterns and like actually really restricting this to this, and it's like looking for my name in like quotes because it knows Google will search for this specifically.\nOh man, I, uh, I almost want to give you my Exa API key and have you run some of these.\nI, Yeah, so this is basically what we would end up building.\nWe'd go build this out, then we'd actually go build the search part of it, and then we'd pull the data out.\nWe build an agent to evaluate the results of the web search to see if we have, we basically write a function that says extract legal name function extract legal name from like content, uh, and like search results.\nExactly.\nAnd just pull that out, and then I'd go do this, and I just go do this over and over again until I have a good legal name.\nCool.\nAnd you could have it output like six and then have a model do the judge thing and pick one or two or three of the best ones and then send three of them to a human in Slack and be like, pick which one is the best and kind of all that kind of stuff.\nExactly.\nAll this basically just becomes software.\nThat's the point because all we're doing is we're just designing like API contracts that have some guaranteed data model, and now we know how to go deal with this data model in one way.\nAnd like for example, like you naturally being like a systems engineer, you went to being like, oh, I'll just run all the high ones in batch parallel.\nSomeone might not do that.\nThey may do everything sequentially.\nThey may write all of them in parallel.\nIt doesn't matter.\nIt's up to you as an engineer to decide the trade-offs that you want to make and the amount of system resources you want to spend to find the answer.\nUm, let's take Sean's question really fast.\nUm, normally I do entity linking as a two-step process, uh, with an entity reference as a span and then a link, but then I realized it's more of a comment than a question.\nUm, yeah.\nSo, I see what you're saying.\nCool.\nYeah, the span is kind of the only problem that I've seen with the span is sometimes the model, if you like use URLs, we discussed this last time in our prompt hacking thing, a model is just less likely to actually dump out a URL correctly.\nSo, I would just recommend swapping out the URL with some like with some indexed ID.\nSo instead of having the model dump out like https google.com like this, oops, like this query is just going to be way worse than having the model spit out like, um, Google search idx0, like there's just way less tokens and way, way fewer things will go wrong, especially once the URLs have like something like, like ref equals like, like once you get to these things where things aren't really mattering, your tokens get completely screwed and hard to go extract.\nSo you want to be really careful about what strings you have the model actually spit out, and you want to reduce the noise or like entropy of those strings to be as stable as possible.\nUm, and we discussed that last week.\nWe had a really fun time discussing all sorts of techniques.\nAre you on team beef up models as you can as you dev or team weaken down models as you dev?\nUm, personally, I'm on team of use the best model possible initially cuz shipping your product is way more important than, um, than cost in the very beginning unless you know for sure you have cost constraints.\nI personally use the maximum amount of resources that I can for a given project without optimization in the very beginning.\nDex, what about you?\nI like to use big models first and then pair it down.\nUm, it depends on the question.\nIt's the same thing with developing agents, too.\nLike the 12-factor agent stuff is all about like, hey, let's get right in the weeds and make things really, really good and engineer everything.\nLike, if you can just give a model 10 tools in a prompt and it can get it right for every single use case that you care about, then do that.\nAnd then when you find the things it can't get right, that's when you start decomposing and engineering.\nExactly.\nOr like in our case today, we\n\n\nKnew for sure that it's impossible for us to dump all the legal companies into the problem.\nSo, we're not going to waste our time doing that because it's it's it's not in the constraints of our problem.\nSo, we'll start with the minimount of work that we can.\nBut, you you still need to know where the walls of the box are and know like, oh, yeah, I'll I'll never no matter how good the no matter how big the model is, this is just never going to yield good results.\nSo, we're going to skip trying to do that.\nBut, you'll notice that I did not write an LLM prompt for validate company, pick potential company.\nI just did the dumb thing where I just use aliases.\nAnd it might work to be completely honest.\nA lot of resumes probably use like one of 50 words to mention a company.\nI may not need an LM for this, but I might want to use an LM anyway uh because it's faster.\nI think one of our engineers said a really really funny thing um recently where they mentioned that we don't actually want to do like a standard library like languages might not need a standard library anymore because technically everything can be an LLM function.\nUh, actually I'll show his expose.\nUm, and I think that was better Antonio because I thought this was very very funny.\nUh, he talked about how when you're actually doing a uh you could technically do URL encoding using an LLM instead of actually using string interpolation and format strings.\nAnd this becomes really interesting behavior in the future as we as developers can go out.\nAnd right now this looks extremely silly because we all know how to do URL encoding uh with just like string interpolation.\nBut this might not be as crazy as it sounds anymore like 5 years from now.\nJust like Slack using 70 gigs of RAM would have been insane 10 years ago, 20 years ago.\nAnd now it's like it's okay.\nEvery laptop's got enough.\nWe just go spend the RAM.\nIt might be true for compute as well.\nI love it.\nUm, anything else before we close out?\nGoing once, going twice.\nAll right.\nWell, today we covered entity extraction.\nUm, thank you guys for joining us.\nNext week I think is going to be really fun.\nDex, do you want to give them a preview of what we're talking about?\nYeah, so I dropped the link in there.\nUm, so we do a lot of work on this show.\nUm, but we also do a lot of riffing.\nAnd our favorite thing is to get on and talk with you about your real problems.\nAnd the things that we don't like doing as much is downloading videos and creating transcripts and writing up notes and things like that.\nAnd so we want to we're going to get a bunch of we're going to get all the boring stuff set up ahead of time, but we want to walk through kind of building live a AI content pipeline where you can take a video like this, whether it's sessions uh that we're doing, whether it's a video you find online, whether it's a meeting you have with the customer, whatever it is, like take recorded content and turn it into a content pipeline of like a small blog post, uh uploading the events in GitHub, pulling out the transcript, um and kind of just like doing as as much as we can do get done in an hour of like how we run the show in the background and how we use AI to kind of make it better and how we apply the we come here and talk about all these like toy problems.\nSo, next week we're going to solve a real problem.\nCool.\nWe're going to be fun.\nI have a quick question if you if you don't mind if you have just a few seconds.\nUm the the\n",
