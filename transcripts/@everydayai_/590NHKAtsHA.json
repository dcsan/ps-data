So, make sure you go check that out.\n\nAll right, enough chitchat. Like I said, everything from Anthropic being in trouble with Reddit to OpenAI's pretty big new connectors that I think are going to change how companies use AI. I think this new study from Apple got a lot of things wrong and Google. Yeah, we have a new version of Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. All right, let's get into the AI news that matters for this week. What's up live stream audience? Good to see you everyone from Al joining us on YouTube from Scotland. Georgie joining us from Jamaica. Kimberly on the LinkedIn machine. From New York City, Jay woke up somehow in West Virginia. Dr. Harvey Castro, thanks everyone for joining us. All right, let's start first. Probably the most recent update in terms of it's only been a couple of hours, but OpenAI has rolled out a major new Advanced Voice Mode upgrade. So OpenAI has launched a significant upgrade to its Advanced Voice Mode in ChatGPT which is now available to all paid users across platforms according to the company. So, the revamped voice mode delivers much more natural speech with improved annotation, realistic cadence, and expressiveness that can capture emotions like empathy and sarcasm. So users can now access real-time language translation as well. That one's pretty cool. By simply requesting it, allowing continuous two-way translation throughout conversations. So that's an enhancement aimed at, you know, travelers, global professionals. But that one's pretty big. Right. By just saying like, \"Hey, act as a translator, you're going to hear, you know, two different people speaking two different languages.\" And, the new Advanced Voice Mode, well, if it works correctly, will take care of the rest. So this new update builds on earlier improvements to accents and interruption reduction, making voice mode more reliable for diverse users. So, these new features are designed to make interactions feel more human and seamless and a little less robotic, which could benefit anyone relying on voice AI for communication. So, I gave this a try. One thing I think this does a little bit better on is starting out in Advanced Voice Mode. One thing that I've, especially when I'm on the phone, one thing I never really know if Advanced Voice Mode is like ready to go. So this new update I think helps with that just a little bit. Kind of that first response. That's just my take right now. OpenAI did also note that there are some limitations including occasional drops in audio quality and some rare instances of unintended sound. So not quite as eerie as the one last year, right? Where the Advanced Voice Mode was like saying help, right? Like help get me out of there. So nothing like that, but OpenAI did say that this isn't perfect and there's probably going to be some mistakes. So live stream audience, have you guys tested the new Advanced Voice Mode out? And I think probably I haven't actually done a lot of coverage on the show of these different voice modes, right? I think I did the original one on a show here. I think one of the reasons is it's sometimes hard to capture to capture that on the phone. So maybe I'll just have to grab my wife's phone because I use my phone to shoot the video here for the live stream. So yeah, let me know if if if I should do the new Advanced Voice Mode. Google live is obviously really good. Perplexity has theirs. I just don't know if our audience podcast people as well. I always put my information in the show notes. Let me know if that's something you'd want to see. A voice off battle or at least going over what these voice modes can and can't do. Let me know if that's something you want to see. Dr. Harvey Casper says, \"E1 Labs and Hume AI are better at emotional intelligence.\" Yeah, we did talk about this on the show last week on the AI News That Matters. 11 Labs has their V3. I don't know. I'd say this new version, maybe not. I'd say the obviously the 11 Labs and Hume maybe 4 days ago were better in this regard. I don't know. I'd say right now this new Advanced Voice Mode update that just rolled out hours ago would at least put OpenAI in the you know either 1A or 1B conversation where I think maybe before there was a little bit of a drop off in terms of quality. Cecilia says, \"Yeah, do a voice off show.\" Brian says it as well. Al here on the YouTube machine says, \"Would like a feature where it could just listen and transcribe.\" Yes. My gosh, I would love that, right? Which is, you know, it's not that big of a deal. You know, generally I would just use a third-party tool, but I would love that as well to just be like, \"Yo, just don't say anything. I'm just going to, you know, word vomit here for 15 minutes. I've tried it before and a lot of times it just cuts out.\" So yeah, Al, I like that idea. You know, just to be like have a translation mode, but just to be able to talk to Advanced Voice Mode for that. I think that would be cool. All right, our next piece of AI news. Anthropic's in trouble. Well, because some of the other big companies like OpenAI and Google have paid tens of millions of dollars to partner with Reddit for their data. And apparently, according to a new lawsuit, Anthropic is just trying to grab it all for free. So, Reddit has filed a lawsuit against Anthropic in California Superior Court, accusing the AI startup of illegally scraping Reddit user comments to train its clawed chatbots. So, the lawsuit claims that Anthropic used automated bots to collect content from Reddit despite explicit requests not to and without user consent, raising fresh concerns over privacy and data rights as AI companies race to improve their models. So unlike other lawsuits targeting copyright infringement, Reddit's case focuses on breach of its terms of use and claims Anthropic's actions accounts to an unfair competition. So like I said, Reddit has pretty lucrative licensing agreements right now with OpenAI and Google and other companies that pay for access to its data, enabling the platform to enforce privacy protections and user rights. So yeah, like when you are using Reddit, you know, you're essentially being like, \"Yo, yeah, I'm giving, you know, Reddit permission to give this data to OpenAI and Google to train their models.\" And these are agreements that helped Reddit prepare for its public stock market debut last year. So, Anthropic's CEO and researchers have previously documented the value of Reddit's subject matter forums for AI training and the company maintains its use of web data is lawful and essential for developing language models. So this lawsuit highlights growing tensions between the content platforms and AI developers, underscoring the stakes for companies relying on user generated content and the potential impact of how publicly available data may be used or restricted in future AI advancements. So it's no secret how valuable Reddit data actually is. Right. So many times if you're looking at the sources of information when you're asking an AI chatbot a question, so many times it comes from Reddit. You could actually make the argument that Reddit, aside from, you know, maybe a source like Wikipedia, you could make us you could make a claim that Reddit is potentially one of the most or if not the most important single website for training data. One of the reasons is a lot of the information that you know these these AI labs kind of just scrape on the open internet are available in kind of like there's redundancy right like even with Wikipedia right a lot of that information especially when it's factual exist in a handful or dozens or hundreds of different sources Reddit not so much because these are individual a lot of times subject matter experts sharing their expertise. Right? If you don't know a ton about Reddit, Reddit has actually been a huge part of many growing organizations content strategy. So, you know, whether it's small business, entrepreneurs, big business, will put out original helpful content on Reddit, either asking or answering people's questions or just, you know, starting topics on, you know, news developments, etc. There's actually been a lot of companies that literally exclusively post on Reddit and don't even post on their company blog just because Reddit is so highly trafficked. So, this one might be at least for me the second or third most interesting kind of AI lawsuit to keep an eye on outside of the New York Times versus OpenAI and Microsoft because this one is huge just because of the value of the data. Again, I would even venture to say Reddit data is more valuable ultimately than data from the New York Times. That pains me as a former journalist to say, but so much of what's in the New York Times is available on dozens of other news publications, whereas a lot of time data on Reddit is exclusive to Reddit. And you know, sometimes it's more of the nuance and human expertise that really helps make these large language models better and more capable. So yeah, Marie saying scraping the internet. What? So what else is new? Yeah, Reddit data is also all over Perplexity. It's everywhere. Right. And obviously people write about Reddit data and source and site Reddit data on their own websites and other websites as well, you know. So there may be some some workarounds or technical loopholes on that. And this is obviously extremely hard to police, but it is one that we should all be keeping an eye on. All right, next piece of AI news. Seems small actually big. ChatGPT and OpenAI making a huge play in the business sphere here with its new connectors for paid users as well as a new ChatGPT meeting recorder. So, OpenAI has introduced a new record feature in ChatGPT Teams for MacOSS letting users record, transcribe, and summarize meetings on voice notes directly within the app. They've also released their new cloud connectors which I'll talk about here in a minute. But the new record tool can transcribe up to 120 minutes per session. And it can turn audio into editable summaries and generate emails, project plans, or even code from conversations, positioning ChatGPT now as a new competitor to companies such as Otter AI or Zoom's transcription features. The OpenAI update also brings cloud connectors and this one is big for Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, Box and SharePoint, allowing ChatGPT business users to search and analyze documents from these platforms while respecting existing user positions permissions. Sorry. So, I did kind of a show on this, but it was technically on Claude's version of this. So, if you scroll back a couple of episodes to episode 539, that show was the one Claude the one new Claude feature that changes knowledge work and how to use it. And actually in that show, I called I'm like, ChatGPT should be releasing this feature any day now. And funny enough, they announced it later that day. But this is pretty big. And and I'm not saying that RAG is dead, right? So, traditional retrieval augmented generation. And you might be wondering like, okay, what the heck is this and why is this actually important? Well, let's look at some of these connectors that I have on screen for our live stream audience. So, I mentioned things like Google Drive, Gmail, I mean Google Calendar, SharePoint, Outlook, Teams. One I'm excited to try is HubSpot. Right being able to chat with your dynamic data is huge. The downside at least on the OpenAI side and maybe one reason that Anthropic's Claude still has an advantage at least in connecting to this enterprise user data is because right now at least in ChatGPT it's only available in deep research mode. So you might have to wait anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes. And you can select which of your connectors that you want OpenAI's deep research to go through. So I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing because in almost everyone's experience, you have\n\n\nA, uh, lower likelihood of hallucinations\nwhen you do the deep research mode. It\nuses a more powerful tool. Uh, the last\nwe heard from OpenAI, they actually use\ndual 03 modes. It's actually using two\nversions, uh, two separate versions of\ntheir very powerful 03 model, uh, to go\nthrough and, uh, do different things. So,\nuh, this one, the connectors space is\nbooming, and I called this last week. I\nsaid, you know, even though technically\nAnthropic beat everyone else, I said, this\nis going to be rolling out to all the\nmajor labs, obviously. Uh, you know,\nOpenAI responded like that that day. Um,\nthis one's, this one's big, right? And\nlike I said, I don't think this kills\ntraditional RAG, right? So, what that\nmeans is if you're asking, uh, let's say\nyou're in a, uh, in a marketing role at a\nhuge logistics company, right? If you're\ntalking to ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude or\nanything else, right, about, let's say,\nindustry-specific news, you don't always\nhave a ton of control. It might bring, it\nmight bring in things from its own\ninternal training, uh, data, which could\nbe extremely outdated. It could be wrong.\nIt could not have the level of expertise\nthat you'd expect by being a subject\nmatter expert and being a marketer in the\nlogistics industry. Uh, right, or it\nmight browse the web, and that's again,\nroll the dice. So, by having it first\nlook at your data, that is huge. That is\nessentially, you know, the, the, the\npromise of retrievable augmented\ngeneration, which is, you know, companies,\nyou know, two to three years ago spent\nmillions of dollars essentially fine-tuning\nmodels with RAG, right, creating these, uh,\nembeddings in their vector databases, uh,\nyou know, essentially creating their own\nversion of a large language model, but\nthat first and primarily used its own\ninternal data, which was a very expensive\nand laborious process, and now we're\ngetting that with a couple of clicks,\nright? And this is one of the reasons, if\nI'm being honest, I was never pushing RAG,\nuh, super hard because I knew that this\nday would come, right? Competing on the\napplication layer is how companies like\nGoogle, OpenAI, and even Claude are going\nto, uh, compete in the long run, you know,\nas we talk about, like, you know, uh,\nknowledge being commoditized, but also\nthat large language models could largely\njust be swappable, like, right,\nreplaceable. Uh, so I think how companies\nare ultimately going to connect is these\ndeep, uh, and dynamic integrations with\nour dynamic data. Um, so pretty, uh,\npretty big, pretty big news here. Uh, and\nand yeah, live stream audience, let me\nknow if you've tried these connectors at\nall. I've tried them. Uh, very\nimpressive. I'll probably be doing\nfollow-up, uh, shows on this either later\nin June and July. There's so many new, uh,\nkind of areas of, uh, these large\nlanguage models. It's, it's difficult to\neven just understand how people are using\nthem. Uh, and yes, I talk to people aside\nfrom just being on this live stream every\nday. I talk to businesses, you know, from\nsmall businesses, startups, Fortune 500\ncompanies, huge companies doing tens of\nbillions of dollars of revenue. I'm\nconstantly talking with them or\nconsulting, you know, they hire us to\nhelp them, you know, learn a large\nlanguage model. So, it is actually\ndifficult right now over the last couple\nof weeks to even understand where the\ninterest is, right? So, please reach out\nand let me even know what are you\ninterested in learning about. All right.\nOur next piece of AI\nnews, for some reason, Google has just\nwoken up and chosen to dominate even\nmore, uh, because they released a new\nversion of its Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro\nmodel, even though their previous version\nof Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro was already by\nfar the most powerful and capable large\nlanguage model. So, Google has begun\nrolling out a preview of its upgraded\nGoogle's Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which will\nbe generally available in the coming\nweeks. So, this new version is labeled\nJune 5th, right? So, it's been out for\njust a couple of days, not to be confused\nwith their previous version, which was\nactually 506. I kind of wait, like, I\nkind of wish that Google would have, like,\nmaybe waited a day or rolled this out a\nday sooner because if you're dyslexic,\nyou're probably going to see these as the\nsame model, and you're going to be like,\n\"Wait, which is this? The 0605 or the\n0506?\" Uh, regardless, it's showing\nsignificant improvements in coding\nbenchmarks, um, challenging tests such as\nGPQA and even humanity's last exam, uh,\nwhich is one of the most challenging, uh,\nkind of, uh, AI benchmarks for large\nlanguage models that ex, that assesses\nmath, science, knowledge, and reasoning\nskills. Uh, so this new update also\naddresses user feedback about\nperformance drops from their previous\nmodel outside of coding, and Google\npromised improved style and structure\nfor more creative and better formatted\nresponses. Uh, and yeah, in terms of\nELO, right, we talk about the LM arena,\nuh, pretty often here on the show. This\nis where you can go in, you put an\ninput, you put a prompt in, uh, you get\noutputs from two different models. You\ndon't know which one's which, you choose\nwhich one's better, and then you get an\nELO score. And Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro,\nthe new version, the June 5th version,\nactually got a 24 point jump over its\nprevious version. So now Google, uh, their\n2.5 Pro is number one and number two on\nthe LM Arena board. So the model upgrade\nis available through the Gemini API or via\nGoogle AI Studio and Vertex AI. Uh, so,\nuh, pretty exciting. And if you remember\nwhen I covered Claude 4, uh, what, what\nepisode was that? If you want to go back\nand, uh, and listen to it, uh, where,\nwhere was that? Here we go. Uh, episode\n534. This was on May 28th when we, uh,\ntalked about Claude 4 because one of the\nthings that Anthropic really hung its hat\non is, you know, all of their scores in\nsoftware engineering, web\ndevelopment, etc. And I said, \"Yeah,\ngood luck with that, Anthropic, because\nthat's going to last a whole maybe week\nor two until Google, uh, updates their\nGoogle's Gemini 2.5 Pro.\" Sure enough,\nwithin about 10 days, uh, you know, they\nwipe out at least external benchmarks, uh,\nthat Anthropic's Claude had. Yeah, they're\ngone. They're gone. Uh, so Google's Gemini\n2.5 Pro on the LM Arena now holds the top\nmark in every single category. It's\nsilly. Uh, it's absolutely silly. Uh,\nso, uh, all right, let's take a quick\nbreak for words from our sponsors at\nGoogle. This podcast is supported by\nGoogle. Hey everyone, David here, one of\nthe product leads for Google Gemini.\nCheck out V3, our state-of-the-art AI\nvideo generation model in the Gemini\napp, which lets you create highquality\n8-second videos with native audio\ngeneration. Try it with a Google AI Pro\nplan or get the highest access with the\nUltra plan. Sign up at gemini.google to\nget started and show us what you\ncreate. All right, and thank you to our\npartners at Google for sponsoring the\nshow. All right, speaking of Google, our\nnext piece of AI news. Well, uh, Chinese\nAI lab DeepSeek is accused of using\nGoogle's Gemini's data to train its\npowerful new updated R1 model. So,\nChinese lab DeepSeek's newly released\nR1, and this is the May 28th version, is\nmaking headlines for its strong\nperformance on math and coding\nbenchmarks. But some researchers suspect\nit was partly trained on data from\nGoogle's Gemini's family of models. So,\nuh, developer Sam Pike and others have\npublished evidence that DeepSeek's\nR10528 uses language and thought traces\nstrikingly similar to Google's Gemini\n2.5 Pro, fueling speculation about data\nsourcing and model training ethics. And\nif you pay attention to the show, you know\nthis is not DeepSeek's first time under\nscrutiny for doing this exact same\nthing. As last December, its V3 model\nwas observed identifying itself as\nChatGPT, further raising concerns about\nunauthorized use of rival AI outputs.\nSo, OpenAI previously told the Financial\nTimes that it found evidence that\nDeepSeek had used distillation on\nOpenAI's models, which is a method that\nextracts training data from larger\nmodels. And Microsoft also flags\nsuspicious data, uh, exfiltration from\nOpenAI developer accounts affiliated\nwith DeepSeek in late 2024. So\nessentially now you have, uh, pretty\nserious, at least whether it's\naccusations or, uh, you could say solid\nproof that DeepSeek has distilled, uh, or\nyou know, kind of just borrowed from, uh,\nOpenAI, Microsoft, and Google to help\ntrain its data. So, you know, when, when\nyou read all these stories about, oh,\nyou know, uh, DeepSeek is the future of\nAI because they can train their models\nat a fraction of the cost. Well,\naccording to reports and executives at\nthese exact same companies, they're\ndoing this because they're literally\njust distilling, uh, so from the\ncompanies that are actually paying the\nmoney to create, train, fine-tune the\nmodels. So, yeah. Hey, where, where are\nyou at, all you, uh, DeepSeek people? Uh,\nyou know, I'm pretty sure you were in\nthe comments back in, uh, December saying\nhow, hey, in a couple of months, you\nknow, OpenAI and and Google are going to\nbe irrelevant. Uh, you know, because\nDeepSeek can train models for, you\nknow, 1/100th of the cost. Yeah. No,\nthey can't, right? Uh, go look at the\nsemi analysis, uh, report on that. I'm\ngoing to go pull up, uh, what, what show\nwas this? I did a, a, a deep dive on\nDeepSeek a couple of weeks after all the\nall the hoopla. So go listen to episode\n460 on that, and I break down the\nartificial analysis report that\nessentially looked at DeepSeek, and\nthey're like, wait, they did not train\nthis model for, you know, $5.6 million,\nwhich is like 5% or 2% of what it would\nactually cost to train. Uh, they actually\nbroke down their actual cost. So, uh, if\nif you want to know the truth on Deep\nSeek, aside from this recent news\nthat's, uh, you know, they're, uh, some\nresearchers are saying, \"Yeah, they're\njust distilling from other models, go\nlisten to episode 460 if you want the\ndeep\ndive.\" All right. Uh, Joe here saying,\n\"Won't touch DeepSeek, uh, Chinese\ngovernment surveillance, uh, worm.\"\nYeah. So, if you're using DeepSeek, FYI,\nvia the API or on their website, you are\nsending all of the any information that\nyou upload, uh, straight to the Chinese\ngovernment. So, this isn't me being\npolitical or me doubting open source.\nI'm all for open source. All right? I'm\nall for open source, openweight models,\nbut I don't know. Do you want to send\nall of your data if you're using the API\nfor using the online version, uh, straight\nto the Chinese government? That's up to\nyou. Maybe you don't care. Uh, but yeah,\nI would definitely be, uh, cautious,\nespecially for, uh, enterprises that\naren't reading the fine print. Yeah, you\nshould probably read the fine print on\nthat\none. All right, our next piece of AI\nnews, uh,\nAnthropic in even more drama. It's been\nthe week of drama for Anthropic. After\nlast week, we saw, uh, you know, over the\nlast two weeks, we saw a week of\nreleases, right? We saw Claude 4, their\nOpus and their Sonnets getting, uh, Claude\n4 pretty big bumps. And then we saw\ntheir, uh, version of, uh, connectors\ncalled integrations. But now it's just all\nthe drama because, like, we just talked\nabout, uh, facing a pretty big lawsuit\nand consequential lawsuit from Reddit, and\nnow, uh, some drama or a potential\nbreakup with Windsurf. So, open, uh,\nsorry, Anthropic has withdrawn nearly all\naccess to its Claude 3.x X model. So you\nknow that's, uh, 35 and, um, uh, 37, uh,\nmodels from Windsurf after reports\nsurfaced that OpenAI is acquiring\nWindsurf for $3 billion. So, uh, Jared\nKaplan, Anthropic's co-founder and chief\nscience officer, confirmed the move was\ndriven by a desire to avoid enabling a\ndirect competitor, uh, to focus and to\nfocus on lasting partnerships, citing\nlimited computing resources as a secondary\nfactor. So, Windsurf users, so if you\ndon't know what Windsurf is, it's one of\nthese kind of AI, uh, vibe coding\nplatforms. It's much more than that, but\nif you had to put it into a category,\nit's a vibe coding platform, uh, like\nCursor, right? So, Windsurf users,\nincluding both their free and pro, uh,\ncustomers, lost direct Claude access with\nless than a week's notice. Uh, and access\nnow requires users to bring their own\nAPI key, while Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro is\nbeing offered at a discounted price as an\nalternative. So, Windsurf, formerly\nKodium, has criticized the decision from\nAnthropic as anti-industry and warned it\ncould negatively impact many other\ncompanies relying on AI model access.\nUh, the timing suggests Anthropic wants\nto prevent its Claude models from\nsupporting soontobe OpenAI owned rival\nand possibly to protect its proprietary,\nuh, data from leaking into competitors\necosystem. So, a lot of people online\nare losing their noodles on this, and\nthey're like, \"Oh, this is such a\nterrible move from Anthropic.\" I don't\nknow. My two cents is I don't blame\nAnthropic, uh, for this. I think it was,\nuh, in bad taste that they cut off, uh,\naccess to these models with, I think they\nsaid, 5 days notice, right? We've seen\nreports on this OpenAI, uh, acquisition\non Windsurf now for 3 weeks. So yes,\nmaybe, uh, Anthropic needed to do its due\ndiligence to independently, uh, kind of\nconfirm this rumored or reported on\nacquisition and to clear things\ninternally. But still to do this with\nonly 5 days, even though I understand\nand agree ultimately with their\ndecision, to do it with only 5 days\nnotice is kind of bad form, right? Uh,\nespecially given the fact that Anthropic,\nuh, I mean, their really only future\ncustomer base, if I'm being honest, uh,\nfor the most part, is software\ndevelopers, web developers, uh, people\ndoing agentic coding, and they're using\ntools like Windsurf and Cursor for that.\nSo I, I, I know this angered, uh, a big\nportion of their current customer base, so\nprobably not a good move at least on the\noptics from Anthropic, even I agree with\nit, y'all. Anthropic's has, uh, like a PR\nproblem, right? We talked about it last\nweek, uh, last week on the show, uh, kind\nof with their, uh, how they talked about,\noh, we, we found all these problems, uh,\nwith Claude 4. They're really bad. And\nthen they deleted the tweet. Uh, yeah, it\nit it's bad internal. I don't understand\nhow a company as big as Anthropic is\nessentially just abysmally bad. I don't\neven know that's a word, but they're\njust very, very bad, um, at comms, right?\nIt's, it's, I don't, I don't understand\nit because this\n\n\nIs a simple business 101, right? Don't piss off your biggest user base. And they did by doing this, even though I think ultimately they made the right decision. You probably should have given at least a couple of weeks of notice. All right. Uh, our next piece of AI news, speaking of kind of hot takes, I might have one on this one tomorrow.\n\nSo, a new Apple research paper called \"The Illusion of Thinking\" argues that AI reasoning models offer only marginal improvements over standard language models and often fail as tasks grow complex, challenging a central narrative in recent AI development. So, according to this Apple study, standard large language models outperform reasoning models on simple tasks, while both types collapse on highly complex problems, with reasoning models regressing as complexity increases, contradicting claims that chains of reasoning yield smarter AI. So, this study highlights a critical vulnerability: introducing small, irrelevant changes to prompts can degrade model performance by up to 65%, revealing the model's reliance on pattern recognition rather than genuine logic or deductive reasoning. So, Apple, in their study, found no evidence that current reasoning models perform true logical problem-solving. Instead, they predict responses based on statistical patterns from their training data, casting doubt on the practical value of chain of thought outputs or these reasoning models. Uh, critics have accused Apple of being shortsighted or self-interested, especially as the company's own AI products like Apple Intelligence and Siri 2.0 face AI challenges. But Apple maintains its focus on privacy-preserving, efficient on-device AI aligns better with real-world use cases. And the paper's conclusion that large-scale reasoning offers limited benefits also happens to coincide with Apple's public strategy of focusing on smaller, efficient on-device models, leading to accusations that the research is just marketing designed to justify their current position. Uh, the research exclusively uses abstract logic puzzles with a single correct answer as its benchmark. This is a terrible study, ignoring the primary real-world applications of reasoning models, which often involve creative collaboration, coding, and drafting, where the step-by-step thinking process itself is a valuable output.\n\nSo, let me just say it now. I'm gonna not sleep a lot today and tonight because I read this study over the weekend, and like, at first, I'm scratching my head, and I'm like, \"How is this come, like, like, who approved this, right?\" This did not seem like a research-led initiative. This seemed like someone high up in the business development side of Apple said, \"Hey, FYI, uh, June 9th, today, right, today is our big WWDC announcement.\" And we are essentially, right, according to reports, uh, Bloomberg said that Apple is taking a quote-unquote \"gap year\" on AI, whereas last year at their WWDC conference, they just said, \"Hey, everything AI, AI, AI, Apple intelligence, Apple intelligence, right?\" So reports are today at Apple's WWDC, they're going to have some quote-unquote AI announcements, but they're essentially being like, \"Oh, whoops. Uh, we couldn't deliver. We're facing multiple class action lawsuits that we promised all of this Apple intelligence and didn't deliver it. They had to pull their, you know, some of their simplest AI features because they were getting it wrong, right? Like email summaries were hilariously wrong. Uh, so Apple clearly has an AI problem. So you have to question the validity of this research. Even though the research itself is valid, how they framed it, I think actually is extremely disingenuous to the research field. Right? I'm not a researcher by any means. I've obviously read hundreds of research papers over the last, you know, three to five years as I become more interested and more involved in artificial intelligence. And out of all the ones I read, this is probably the most questionable research paper I've ever read. Like I said, the observations are sound, but this seemed like marketing. This seemed like cherry-picking. Uh, this seemed like just something that again just seemed very disingenuous to just the AI research community, right? This seemed like almost Apple, uh, you know, bending over backwards to try to cherry-pick and frame uh, certain research data to justify how they are absolutely so bad at AI. It is unfathomable that a company like Apple, many years later after we saw reports they were spending millions of dollars a day internally on their own AI systems, couldn't roll out anything that didn't work or didn't get them sued. So instead of facing the facts and doubling down and getting it right now, instead, they're taking a gap year and they're putting out a suspiciously timed research paper that cast doubt on the future of large language models literally hours before their announcement where their future of large language models is being swept under the rug. Huh. Interesting, right?\n\nYeah. Uh, Joe here saying, \"Apple marketing commissioned a study to prove that AI reasoning models are overhyped.\" Yeah, little tongue and cheek, but I'm with you there, Joe. This doesn't seem like a research-led like survey, right? Like even looking at the actual facts the researchers make. So the facts are sound, right? But they're also illogical, right? In the way that they're framed. I'm like, this seems like a company with a huge agenda that is trying to uh, shift markets because they know by putting this out at this time, is getting a ton of news coverage, and news coverage, whether you believe it or not, it shifts markets. So, uh, yeah, actually tune in tomorrow. I'm going to commit to it right now. Uh, we're going to do a hot take Tuesday on this paper. I know that sounds dorky, but I got takes. All right.\n\nUh, and our last piece of AI news, Meta is reportedly in talks for a 10 billion dollar plus investment in Scale AI. So, according to Bloomberg reports uh, and Reuters, Meta Platforms is exploring an investment in Scale AI that could exceed $10 billion. So the deal, if finalized, would be one of the largest investments in an artificial intelligence startup ever and underscores the intensifying race among tech giants to secure AI capabilities. So Scale AI was founded in 2016 and was last valued near 14 billion, specializes in data labeling, and already counts Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta as backers. The company also operates a platform for AI researchers to share information with participation from uh, from contributors across more than 9,000 different cities. So according to this new report on Meta's uh, purported $10 billion investment, terms of the potential deal are not yet finalized and could still change, with Meta and Scale AI both declining to comment on the talks. If completed, the investment could further accelerate the advancements in AI technology and provide new opportunities for professionals and companies seeking to leverage large-scale data infrastructure. This is a big move here. This is a big move. I think this is a potential deal that could catapult Meta into this one uh, kind of tier one discussion, right? Uh, and and I don't know, maybe it's because of uh, Meta takes is the only big tech trillionaire company to take this uh, primarily open-source, open-weights approach with their Llama models, although Google does probably have the most capable uh, open model, at least small open small language model in Gemma 3N, uh, but this is pretty big. I think this is something if it works out well and if Meta takes good advantage of this data, of this potential partnership uh, with Scale AI, it could make the race at the top much more interesting because at least since uh, quarter 4 of last year, so around November, December, it's really just been Google and OpenAI at the top, right? You could say they're flip-flopping in the 1A spot, and then you have kind of uh, uh, Anthropic and Microsoft uh, in that 1B spot. But you kind of have a big drop off, I would say, uh, until you get to Meta and their Llama models, even after their most recent releases a couple of months ago.\n\nAll right. And, uh, you all said you wanted this uh, this new little segment in here at the end of the AI news that matters are rumors and what's next. So, like I said, what's very next? Well, in about uh, less than four hours, we're going to see Apple's WWDC, their worldwide developer conference. Uh, today at noon Central Standard Time, so noon Chicago time. But it's been reported they're essentially taking a gap year on AI. They're going to be uh, opening up their three different uh, internal large language models to developers and some other small AI announcements, but they're essentially uh, you know, tucking their tail between their legs uh, and not saying AI every fifth word like they did last year because that blew up in their face. Uh, still no Grok 3.5, although the Twitter verse is saying it's going to be dropping at any day soon. But, uh, Elon Musk might be a little busy with his current breakup with President uh, President Donald Trump. Uh, GPT40 is showing some tracks of thinking for some users, which is interesting. A non-reasoning model is showing traces of reasoning for many users sharing online. Google's new uh, I think I might have got that that uh, that one wrong there. I think it's called Spark uh, Sparkify. Uh, yeah, Google's new Sparkify uh, is an invite-only creative machine that uses uh, Google's different uh, AI platforms to create videos up to two minutes long. You know what's weird, guys? I told you all that by the end of 2025, we were going to be able to create our own very high-quality bespoke versions of like Pixar movies. And y'all laughed at me, and I'm like, \"No, you guys.\" I talked to the people developing this technology. It's coming. Trust me. And a lot of you people probably thought I was crazy, but here we are. It's already starting to roll out where you can literally create up to a two-minute video with a simple prompt uh, in the uh, Google Sparkify, which right now is invite only. Uh, Google V3 has started rolling out uh, a fast version in the flow video editor. Uh, Google, yeah, a lot of Google uh, what's next in rumors. Uh, Google is going to be rolling out scheduled actions in Gemini soon, which I'm extremely excited about that one. That's one of the things I love most, and I think one of ChatGPT's most underrated features is scheduled uh, tasks. So uh, now uh, looks like Google is testing that out in certain Gemini accounts and Notebook LM in kind of an ask me anything session. Uh, they kind of laid out some of their roadmap uh, some things that are probably coming soon: video overviews, new source types, and even an API. A Notebook LM API is mind-boggling what that could do for the industry.\n\nAll right, I hope this was helpful. So, let me quickly recap the AI news that matters. So, OpenAI has released an updated and more human-like version of its Advanced Voice Mode. Reddit is suing Anthropic for allegedly scraping user data. It didn't have a uh, a license to do. Uh, OpenAI has launched its new cloud connectors and ChatGPT meeting recorder. Although I haven't seen the meeting recorder uh, pop up in my Mac app yet. The cloud connectors are there. Google has unveiled its upgraded Gemini 2.5 Pro model, even though it was already winning the race. Uh, new reports are saying that Chinese AI lab is uh, using Gemini data to train its new powerful R1 model. Anthropic has cut clawed access for Windsurf amid OpenAI acquisition rumors. Uh, a new Apple study is challenging the hype around AI reasoning models, but I'm going to break that down in tomorrow's hot take Tuesday. And last but not least, Meta is reportedly in talks for a $10 billion plus investment into Scale AI, which would be one of the largest investments in an AI company ever.
