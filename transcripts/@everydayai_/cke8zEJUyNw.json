  "cleanText": "This is the Everyday AI show.\nThe everyday podcast where we simplify AI and bring its power to your fingertips.\nListen daily for practical advice to boost your career, business, and everyday life.\n\nIf you listen to this show at all, especially in the last week or so, you'll know that I'm sometimes kind of hard on Anthropic's Claude.\nTo 18 months, it's gone from probably a top-tier large language model to almost a forgotten AI tool that's now almost exclusively for developers in the future.\nIt seems of what it's going to be used for the most is for software engineers, coders, people like that, not the everyday business leader, but that's kind of changed a little bit in the past just 24 hours.\nAnd there is one new feature in Anthropic's Claude base pay plan, the $20 a month plan that is already going to I think change how I work and it will change how you work as well if you choose to use it and spend the next 30 or so minutes with me.\n\nAll right, I'm excited to talk about the one new Claude feature that changes knowledge work and how to use it today on Everyday AI.\nWhat's going on y'all?\nMy name is Jordan Wilson and I'm the host of Everyday AI.\nThis thing, it's for you.\nIf you're new here, we do this every single day, a live stream, podcast, and free daily newsletter helping us all not just learn what's happening in AI, but how we can leverage it to get ahead to grow our companies in our careers.\nIs that you?\nThat is literally what you're trying to do, right?\nYeah, me too.\nUh, well, you're in the right place.\nIt starts here with the unedited, unscripted live stream and podcast, but you need to actually make it all happen in our newsletter.\nThat's where you need to go.\nUh, so go to YourEverydayAI.com, sign up for the free daily newsletter.\nEach and every day, we recap our episode, as well as keeping you up to date with literally everything else that you need to be to be the smartest person in AI at your company.\nUh, all right.\nSo, uh, most days we start with EIA news.\nNot doing that today.\nThat's going to be in the newsletter.\nSo, make sure you go check that out.\nAll right.\nUh, also live stream audience, I'm thinking about trying something new.\nAll right.\nIt's Wednesday.\nI'm thinking about this new segment called AI work on Wednesdays or something like that.\nAll right.\nI've heard from a lot of you all over the years that you love live demos.\nYou'd like to kind of get your hands dirty, uh, you know, and see how to actually use Chat GBT, Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, uh, you know, maybe some of the visual tools or creative tools.\nI don't always like doing that because actually I think our biggest audience is on the podcast.\nWell, by far, uh, thanks to your all support, we're usually a top 10 tech podcast on Spotify out of like 90,000.\nUh, and sometimes I think these things work a little bit better for the live stream and on the video.\nSo, podcast audience, uh, you know, these might be ones that, hey, on Wednesdays, make sure you go to our website.\nOn our website, you can watch the video.\nSo, yes, there's a live stream here.\nI'm going to be sharing my screen.\nBut hey, live stream audience, let me know.\nShould we do this AI work on Wednesdays thing?\nShould this become a regular segment?\nI'll ask you again at the end.\nSo, just say yes or no or maybe you want to see how it goes.\nYou can say yes or no at the end.\nAll right.\nUh, so, uh, let's talk about that one feature.\nThe new feature is the combination of a deep research mode inside uh Anthropic's Claude and the new and expanding integrations.\nSo, it's kind of new but kind of not uh because Anthropic actually released this uh about a month ago.\nHowever, uh just in the last 24 hours, they've upgraded it significantly.\nBut the biggest upgrade is the availability.\nUh previously you had to be on their super expensive uh you know max plan that starts at a hundred up to $200 a month in order to get this research in a lot of the integrations.\nHowever, now Anthropic has just rolled this out to their base pro plan.\nSo if you are on the, you know, $20 a month uh Claude Pro plan like I am, um then you can go take advantage of this right away.\nActually, Claude is the only one.\nI'm not on the top tier, right?\nI'm on the, you know, $250 a month uh Gemini plan.\nI'm on the $200 a month Chad GBD plan with Claude.\nI've never been able to stomach anything more than the uh the $20 a month pro plan, mainly because the limits.\nUh so I which is funny because I'm going to do a a live demo here and I've intentionally haven't used Claude the last couple of hours because I know if I do more than like three prompts, I'm going to run out of uh messages.\nSo, yeah, especially when you're working with longer context windows and having Claude do complex things, that $20 a month plan is pretty useless.\nThe paid plan, uh, I hit my rate limits usually in about seven minutes when I'm really pushing it.\nSo, I'm not going to push it intentionally too far.\nThat's another thing with doing these.\nHey, if I do this, you know, AI work on Wednesdays.\nIf I'm doing anything at Claude, there's a good chance it's going to just stop, right?\nUh, and I don't edit this thing.\nSo, uh, yeah, we'll see how it goes.\nBut that is the new thing.\nIt is the combination of the uh the deep research.\nIt's technically just called research but uh a lot of people call the deep research mode uh on Anthropic's Claude uh with the integrations.\nSo I'm going to explain a little bit more what those are.\nBut uh the first of all it's just the research right so if you've used or if you've uh if you've used any of the deep research services from OpenAI uh from uh Gemini I think those are like 1A and 1B.\nProbably Gemini is a little ahead uh of of uh OpenAI's uh deep research but it's really neck and neck and then you know Grock has their version perplexity has their version uh Microsoft Copilot has their version as well so you know everyone's really getting into this deep research game and one of the reasons why well number one it does a ton of research for you which is great but in doing that that also reduces the rate of hallucinations exponentially so yes depending on which uh deep research tool you're you're using it might take anywhere from you know 2 to 45 minutes.\nSo it's not something you get instantaneously but uh these new deep research tools are uh highly capable and then when you can combine them with both things like tool use being able to you know as an example query the internet uh when it deems that it needs to as well as uh working with direct integrations which is what this new cloud rollout has.\nThose are huge huge uh possibilities.\nSo, like I said, uh the big news here, aside from it rolling out to the pro plan, is this combines uh existing and new app integrations inside Claude with the deep research mode.\nAnd in this case, it can go anywhere from five to 45 minutes.\nAnd this unlocks contextual business knowledge from apps and the web.\nAnd this transforms how teams can discover, analyze, and act on information.\nAnd and the other cool thing here is Anthropic is also uh rolling out uh an um an MCP mode that can work in their deep research mode.\nSo what that is uh Anthropic has created and obviously popularized the model context protocol.\nDon't worry, we're going to do uh probably sometime in June we'll do a uh a show on the model context protocol.\nEssentially in the same way that uh you know SAS products or the internet you know the internet can talk to each other with APIs right that's how internet uh internet websites and uh different SAS uh you know softwares talk to each other AI and large language models can't use APIs so they needed essentially a language a universal language to talk to each other and essentially Anthropic invested in it early popularized it now other companies are coming up with their own as Well, you know, you have A2A from Google, but MCP is probably uh the biggest, the most popular and the most widely supported.\nUh even companies like Google, like OpenAI uh are supporting uh Anthropic's MCP.\nUh so that's huge when you can also what that means is you can do this deep research and hopefully I'll be able to explain this to you as we do it live and connect to really any data uh via going the MCP route.\nSo, I'm going to give it an example working uh with some of uh Claude's direct integrations.\nAll right.\nAlso, if this is helpful at the end, go ahead and repost this uh and I I have put together a document on the seven best use cases uh for research uh integrations.\nAll right.\nSo, uh combining these two, I spent some time I put together some great um use cases.\nSo, just go repost this.\nSo, if you're listening on the podcast, I always uh leave a link uh to the LinkedIn uh show.\nSo, if you want those, uh, just go ahead and repost this and I'll send them to you.\nAnd if I ever forget, just bug me.\nUh, my LinkedIn DMs are are nuts.\nJust, you know, reach out.\nUh, you know, just poke me, right?\nIt's like Facebook.\nIt's like, \"Hey, I I shared this.\nSend this to me.\"\nAll right.\nAll right.\nSo, let's learn live.\nWhat could go wrong?\nWhat could go wrong?\nUh, doing something that's kind of advanced.\nUh, absolutely live.\nUh, especially when we're working with um rate limits, which is uh never fun.\nUh, yeah.\nThe the the Claude rate limits are absolutely terrible.\nSo, uh live stream audience, let me know when you can see my screen here.\nUh let's get the correct one up.\nHopefully, uh hopefully y'all can see it here.\nAll right.\nUh yes.\nAnd also, I'm not my normal setup, right?\nUh so, I'm on just my laptop.\nNormally, I have my big screen, so I'm going to be fumbling around.\nI'm actually uh uh in Atlanta.\nSo, uh have a really cool uh partnership going on that I'll share with you guys a little bit more later this week.\nAll right.\nSo, let's see.\nAll right.\nLet's just do this.\nAll right.\nSo, now podcast audience.\nI have opened up Claude.\nClaude.ai.\nSo, I'm working with Claude on the front end.\nYes.\nEveryone is always reminds me, hey Jordan, you you always, you know, poo poo on Claude you know for not being great on the front end.\nAnd you can use it on the back end.\nYes, you can.\nIt's terribly expensive compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro or Gemini 2.5 uh flash, you know.\nSo, when it comes to uh capabilities and also keep in mind Gemini 2.5 Pro, if you read our newsletter, Logan Kilpatrick confirmed they're coming out with a new version.\nSo, uh, yeah, even if you're, you know, big into software development or anything like that, uh, you know, oh, you know, hey, Claude gives me these couple of points of advantage that's going to be gone pretty soon the next time, uh, Google updates Gemini 2.5.\nAll right.\nAnyways, I am now sharing uh, my screen.\nI have a super long prompt.\nSo, I already have the results of uh, these prompts that I've ran.\nUh, but I'm actually making it a little more difficult.\nUh so I will share and try to walk through for our podcast audience uh exactly uh what I was prompting uh the inputs and the outputs.\nBut I'm going to start this one live.\nThen I'm going to jump back into my slides that I usually have most days here on the podcast.\nUh and then we're going to check in at the end.\nAll right.\nBut here's what I'm doing.\nAnd if you are on the pro plan, you're going to see this new button here that says research and it's in beta.\nUh so anytime you want that you're going to uh if you want to do the research and again depending on the complexity of the query and depending on uh the integration type that you select this could take up to 45 minutes.\nSo in my test it took about 12 minutes.\nThat's why I couldn't do like five of them live.\nAll right.\nSo you're going to want to click on research.\nUh also uh you can choose the different models.\nI'm going to go sonnet 4 for this not opus 4.\nI think Opus will take too long.\nAnd I also think the the the marginal uh gain that you get from using uh Claude 4 or Claude Opus 4, which is the large version versus the medium version of Claude 4.\nI don't think it's worth it in terms of like waiting for the time.\nHowever, I am going to enable the extended thinking mode uh inside Claude Sonnet 4 uh to force Claude to, you know, kind of think step by step uh think logically, plan ahead, etc.\nAll right.\nSo, right now, here's the other thing that will be new.\nAll right.\nSo, uh if you click the toggle, uh the search and tools option uh here inside Claude, uh and then if you scroll to the bottom, there's a new section here that says add integrations.\nOkay.\nUh that's going to bring up the integrations um uh kind of section here within Claude.\nAnd you'll see there's some uh direct ones here such as uh Google Drive, Gmail, uh Google Calendar that have been there for a while, uh GitHub, uh and then you can also click this Git integration.\nUh and then they have a guide.\nThere's the pre-built uh integrations which include things like Asauna, uh Intercom, PayPal, uh Square, Zapier, and Zapier is the huge one, but also uh you can create your own just via MCPS.\nSo, more on that uh later in this show.\nSo, let's go back.\nSo, now that you know what I'm doing, I have the research button toggled.\nI have extended thinking on um and I do have uh drive search enabled and that part's important here.\nAll right.\nYes, I have a very long prompt here.\nI'm going to paste in uh and then I'm going to tell you uh essentially what this prompt is doing.\nAll right.\nUh it's actually super small.\nUh so let me go ahead and open up a uh blank Google doc and uh hopefully y'all can see it this way.\nAll right.\nSo here's essentially what I'm trying to do and this is a real use case.\nAll right?\nAnd I always encourage people like don't rely on other people's use cases, other people's benchmarks.\nYou need to be developing your own internally.\nSo this is kind of an advanced one that\n\n\nI've uh kind of developed uh to test both agentic uh agentic tool use in a hybrid model uh as well as deep research uh that is integrated with uh documents.\nSo I know that sounds niche uh but I would assume pretty soon this is going to be available uh to do in all major uh providers: Chad GBT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, etc.\nSo, you need to be building out these use cases.\nUh, right?\nDon't just blindly use a tool.\nYou need to be testing them.\nRight?\nThat's what I'm doing.\nThat's what I'm doing here live.\nAll right.\nSo, what I'm essentially doing is I'm telling Claude to look in a specific folder in my Google Drive.\nAll right.\nAnd then I'm explaining what's in this document.\nAll right.\nSo, uh, essentially I created this folder in Google Drive not too long ago, probably only like six or seven months.\nSo, uh, after each newsletter, um, I go through and I write the newsletter, right?\nUh, I write it.\nI'm a human.\nI use AI to help me, obviously.\nSo I upload the transcript, you know, uh, the AI system, we use Cast Magic, other things, you know, pulls out some insights, you know, pulls out some ideas, but, you know, I'm the one that actually goes through and type it.\nUh, types it.\nI type it.\nUh, I love doing it.\nUh, I'm a writer.\nI was a journalist before.\nIt's one it's one way that if for me because I use so much AI I love still just writing manually uh as much as I can but I obviously have AI uh you know get me the first you know 20% pull out ideas because you know I do a lot of podcasts right and a lot of times I forget things uh okay so what I'm saying is go look at all of these documents so uh each day I write this leverage portion for the newsletter so if you read our newsletter and if you don't read it why aren't you reading it, you should uh like I said, it's humans, right?\nUh but at the very bottom, uh there's this section we call leverage.\nSo, there's a little intro and then there's three main points in a section called try this.\nSo, it's actionable tips based on uh you know, the guest or if it's my, you know, if I'm the just like today's show, uh right, I'm going to write it up after this.\nSo, I'm telling it there's all of these documents uh and here's how they're named.\nThey're in this folder.\nUh, so I'm explaining what what these are.\nSo I'm essentially saying go look at all these documents.\nThere's a couple of hundred.\nAll right.\nAnd then I'm telling it, uh, hey, you should also match up this um this leverage section with the blog post that it corresponds with on our website.\nHere's the trick, and here's where I'm testing this model.\nAre you still running in circles trying to figure out how to actually grow your business with AI?\nMaybe your company has been tinkering with large language models for a year or more, but can't really get traction to find ROI on Gen AI.\nHey, this is Jordan Wilson, host of this very podcast.\nCompanies like Adobe, Microsoft, and Nvidia have partnered with us because they trust our expertise in educating the masses around generative AI to get ahead.\nAnd some of the most innovative companies in the country hire us to help with their AI strategy and to train hundreds of their employees on how to use Gen AI.\nSo whether you're looking for chat GBD training for thousands or just need help building your front-end AI strategy, you can partner with us too, just like some of the biggest companies in the world do.\nGo to your everyday.com/partner to get in contact with our team.\nOr you can just click on the partner section of our website.\nwill help you stop running in those AI circles and help get your team ahead and build a straight path to ROI on GenAI.\nIt's there there's no link in there.\nI probably should have done the link right all along.\nUh but you know depending on when I write it, you know, maybe the web post isn't up yet, right?\nSo each and every episode that we do here on Everyday AI, uh there's a web page for it.\nWe put the transcript on there.\nUh we put some uh some key points.\nWe put the YouTube videos you can go watch uh we we embed the actual podcast episodes you can you know multimedia experience.\nSo I'm essentially saying yo here is the uh the leverage section but you're going to have to go find the corresponding blog post.\nAll right so uh go find it uh and then for this task is actually pretty hard.\nSo, here's the three things I'm asking it to do based on uh all of these files inside of my Google Drive and then, you know, testing its tool use ability uh to go in find information on the web because Claude, as of a couple of months ago, finally got access to browse the web.\nSo, I'm saying step one, I want to come up with 10 mashup ideas.\nAll right.\nRight.\nSo, what that means in a simple example, and this is what I kind of told Claude, I'm like, \"Yo, I've talked to dozens of people about AI agents.\nI should be able to create three niche and very different mashup episodes on agents, right?\nUm, you know, and as an example, I can pull a couple of quotes uh from different people and combine them.\nSo instead of me talking to one person generally about agents, you know, I can have you, you know, four or five uh people kind of contributing in one episode from past episodes, right?\nUh so it's almost like a highlight reel but creating multiple of them because I've probably had 10 hours of episodes on agents.\nSo it's like I should be able to create a good show, right?\nBut also it requires more research in between uh you know it would require me to you know uh have intros and segways between all these pieces.\nRight?\nSo essentially first I'm telling it to go build uh 10 mashup episode ideas and outlines.\nAll right?\nAnd and I'm giving it you know very specific uh things to do.\nThen I'm telling it to do uh do the actual episode layout.\nSo, what that means is I'm saying like, yo, go write the episode, right?\nSo, not only, you know, step one is like write an outline, right?\nGive me ideas.\nHere's the people that could be on it, but step two, I'm saying go look at step one and then actually put it together.\nFind the actual quotes.\nPut the quotes together.\nUm, and then also for me, for Jordan, you need to do additional research.\nMake sure it's up to date.\nYou know, do an intro segue.\nSo, you know, step one, it's helping it for step two.\nAnd then for uh step three, I'm saying find 10 new episodes ideas.\nSo I'm saying essentially based on all of this, right?\nSo you're going you're looking at our last six months of episodes, you're doing additional research on your own.\nGo find things we aren't covering and we haven't covered.\nAnd then uh suggest 10 episode ideas.\nBut not just that, you know, do research on those ideas.\nOutline them like we outlined them in step one.\nAnd then also find five potential guests who could be great guests for those shows.\nAll right, so that was a long uh explanation.\nAll right, so now let's jump in and uh let's check in on Claude.\nAll right, so you'll see here um you can always watch.\nSo essentially, it's going through all of these sources live.\nAll right, I'm going to zoom in a little bit.\nHopefully our live stream audience can see this.\nAll right, so I can click on this as I wait.\nSo, so far it's been doing this uh deep research uh across these different sources for 6 and 12 minutes and it's already gone to uh 230 plus sources.\nSo, it's looked at 81 different sources uh inside my Google Drive, including one search inside of my Google Drive and then 147 other searches.\nAnd I can always go in here and I can kind of look and see exactly the documents that it's looking looking at.\nIt looks like there was a couple errors.\nSo I don't know what those errors are.\nIt could have been a permissions.\nUh so I probably should have changed the permissions at the folder level, which I thought I did, but maybe I didn't.\nAll right.\nSo it's going through all of these different files that I told it to.\nAnd then it's also doing additional research also like I told it to uh on a lot of thirdparty websites.\nSo I'm scrolling here.\nThere should be a lot from our website, your everydayai.com.\nI don't see that yet because Okay, here we go.\nFinally got to it, but not a ton here because I told it to specifically Okay, here we go.\nAll right, so it looks like it did go to at least maybe 40 or 50 pages.\nUh maybe 50 or 60 pages on our website.\nAnd you'll see here uh for our live stream audience at least, it's going back and forth, right?\nThis is the power of large language models that have agentic tool use.\nThat means it's starting as an example, it started in uh the Google Drive folder, right?\nUh and then it did some research on thirdparty sites, okay?\nMultiple rounds.\nThen let's see, let's scroll down here.\nThen it went to your everyday AI.\nOkay.\nThen it went back into Google Drive probably to confirm some things, right?\nSo this is the difference.\nAnd and and to tell you the truth, this is kind of the difference between like a CPU and a GPU.\nAnd this is why I've been losing my noodle uh for the past, you know, couple of months when it comes to a gentic tool use.\nI don't think people understand how big that is, right?\nIf you're a little bit of a dork, think of the difference between a CPU and a GPU, right?\nWhich is essentially a CPU is a little slower.\nIt's how computers run, right?\nAnd it runs one process at a time.\nIt finishes it and runs another process.\nA GPU can run parallel processes all at once.\nSo it is infinitely more powerful.\nAnd I think uh the same can be said about this big step up uh from going from a you know kind of an AI chatbot to an AI chatbot that has agentic tool use, right?\nUh it is absolutely wild but also uh an agentic chatbot that has or sorry uh a chatbot that has agentic tool use and is powered by a reasoning model.\nRight?\nThat's the other thing.\nThis isn't powered by a quote unquote old school transformer model that is essentially a next token prediction, right?\nEven though it is.\nUh but this is one that thinks and plans uh ahead like a human would.\nAll right.\nUh so let's go ahead.\nWe're going to check on this at the end, but let me go ahead and finish my little presentation and give you the rest of the details.\nAll right.\nStick around.\nI'm going to go through these uh quickly.\nAll right.\nSo before we check in, let's now talk about some of the details.\nI covered a little bit of this, but how can you access this right now?\nWell, you have to be on uh a paid uh Anthropic plan.\nLuckily, you don't have to be on the the max plan, $100, $200 plan uh a month anymore or on a team plan, which unfortunately for Claude, I think requires five users.\nThe other thing, web search, right?\nYou already saw it like a couple of months ago, it didn't have web search.\nIt does now.\nThere are going to be some upcoming integrations including Stripe, GitLab, and Box uh to expand some possibilities.\nAlso, keep in mind Chad GBT is going to be rolling this out in the same way very soon.\nThey've already started to roll it out.\nUh more on the team plan, unfortunately, uh but we have seen some rumors in Brans, if you listen to our Monday show, uh that this is going to be rolling out to other plants as well.\nUh so, why does this matter?\nWell, think of think of what I just described.\nRemember I just said, \"Oh, it went and looked at all these documents.\nThen it started doing thirdparty research.\nThen it went to your everyday.com.\nThen it went back to Google Docs and it went through, you know, 83 documents.\nThis is a project I need done, right?\nI could do it.\nI would probably be the best person to do it cuz I've I like I did all these shows, right?\nI cannot tell you how long this would take me to accurately do.\nIs Claude going to do it at an A grade?\nProbably not, right?\nBut for me to even do a C job on this would take hundreds of hours.\nThis is a herculean task.\nI mean, we're technically talking uh about thousands of pages, right?\nBecause those web pages on our site are thousands of words, right?\nBecause it includes the entire transcript.\nAnd I'm telling it, we'll see how it does.\nI'm telling Claude to go in and literally pull the best quotes verbatim.\nThat is an extremely timeconsuming task.\nSo again, think of your use case.\nI'm showing you mine.\nThis is, you know, AI work on Wednesdays or whatever we'll call this, right?\nBut think of how long it takes to find that relevant information across different systems.\nIt is super slow and inefficient.\nAnd to be able to have to go and gather that data manually really number one it's exhausting for humans or teams of humans to do that to manually go out and fetch and retrieve all this information uh to to to summarize it uh to to paraphrase it to pull key insights to just do that it empties a tank right but then to h to have to actually create something new out of all that information it is nearly impossible.\nThis task, I've been wanting to do it for years, like since I started, right?\nI've been doing Everyday AI for two and a half years.\nI had this idea a year and a half ago.\nI'm like, \"Oh, I should start doing this.\nIt's been on my to-do list for 18 months.\"\nAnd and I I didn't want to do it cuz either it was going to take me an ungodly amount of hours or I would have to probably pay a person or a company tens of thousands of dollars to do it.\nWell, we'll see.\nCan Claw do it?\nRight.\nAnd in general, this is the future of work.\nTeams that are using this for faster and more comprehensive understanding of their current knowledge and their strategic decision-making.\nSo, right now, here's what it does.\nThey can research the web, your Google Workspace, including Calendar, Gmail, uh, and Drive, which is huge.\nAnd any of those connected app datas.\nI'm going to run uh run through those again at the end.\nAnd then Claude says it can take up to 45 minutes.\nBut like I said, depending on what you're having it do and how good your\n\n\nPrompting is, never do it once. Always iterate, right? But this could end up saving you dozens or hundreds of hours, right? Per each time you use it. All right. Uh, so let's talk a little bit about some of the uh apps that uh you can integrate with. So, I did go over these a little bit previously, but you can do it with Jira, Confluence, Zapier, Asana, Intercom, right? And there's more coming soon. I'm especially excited about the MCP and the Zapier integration because that opens it up to essentially the entire internet. Uh, and the biggest thing here is it gains live context. You know, that's the downside with working with things inside Claude's projects or Chad GBT's projects or Chad GBT's custom GBTs or Gemini's uh gems which don't work the best right now uh even with Google's own products. The problem is is so many times you're working with static data and you're not always a and you're just working uh not with this Deep Research Mode that has this agentic deep tool use. All right. So, an example is, well, you could use Zapier to auto post autopull sales data or prep briefs from whatever, you know, CRM or ERP or whatever alphabet soup uh, you know, piece of software you use that's important for your company. And here's the thing I'm excited about: pre-built integrations using remote MCP. So, uh, this was just updated uh today. So, paid users can now connect to tools uh via the uh integration URLs with the remote MCP feature. Uh, so, uh, I did kind of show you that on my screen earlier. Uh, but it's very simple. Uh, you don't even have to be super technical. Uh, right, the first time I did this, I'm not a super technical person, right? So, if you aren't either, don't worry. If I'm being honest, what I did is I pulled in all the information from Claude's website. I pasted it into Claude and I said, \"Walk me through this.\" Right? And it was pretty, pretty simple. Uh, right? But now you have the custom and third-party integrations that are also supported via MCP. So let's talk about a couple of use cases. All right? But like I said, go repost this. I'll share seven that I think are great. But a couple uh on the legal side, you can automate due diligence, case research, and document assembly. Uh, finance, you can accelerate uh private equity deal screening via automated multissource data. That one's huge. Uh, support, you can identify feedback patterns and autofile bugs, right? Uh, using uh, you know, in Intercom as an example or using something in Zapier or a third-party MCP. I think the use cases are plenty. So, how should you use this, and don't worry, we're going to check in uh on our on our prompt, see if it's done right after this, but how should you use this and what are the next steps? Well, first, you need to identify the tasks right now that need deep research, right? And these sometimes are things that you're already doing. Uh, so first I use I identify the ones that are already sucking up your time and your team probably hates it. All right? And then also find the ones that you wish you had time to do but can't. Start with the ones you're already doing though, right? You need to win back your time with generative AI. Then connect the critical apps, right? Whatever that is. Uh, to Claude, I would you know, obviously start with uh Gmail, uh Google Drive, and Google Calendar if you are a Google Workspace organization, uh Zapier for sure, uh because then you can connect to more than 6,000 uh or might up to be up to like 7,000 apps now. Uh, and then pilot whatever it is, right? Don't just go in there and start playing. You need to talk to your talk to your team. Talk to your people. Share this episode with them first and then sit down and say, \"What are we going to pilot?\" I think one of the biggest problems, and I'm I'm not going to go off on a, you know, five-minute riff here. I promise. One of the biggest problems with AI is people just run and go with no destination. Okay, before you start, before you even go and check, oh, do I have access to this? Well, you should. But before you do that, first listen to this episode again. Okay? Share this episode with your team. Then sit down and say, \"What are we gonna pilot? What is our end goal?\" All right? Get a finish line before you start running because then you'll know when to stop running and then you'll be able to measure it and then you'll be able to scale it. All right. So, uh, let's check in, shall we? Hopefully, this worked. Let's see.\nAll right, it's done. Yay. Okay, so in total, it went to uh it didn't go to any more sources from when I checked in at that uh whatever it was, 6 and 1/2 minutes. So, it ended up doing 229 total sources. Uh, 11 minutes and 29 seconds. And y'all, please, please, please always go and click. Uh, so, it's this little box. I wish uh all the companies do a bad job at this. Like the the the UI is not good. Most people don't even know that you can go and click that, right? It's this little box, right? Uh, with a little arrow. It's so thin. Go click that because you essentially can read uh it's not the actual chain of thought uh unfortunately. Uh, but it at least shows the process uh that in this case Claude went through because again I always encourage people look at the results. Look at the steps. Update your prompt. Do it again. All right. So, let's look at the results, though, and let's see how well it actually did. Uh, it did these things. All right. And live stream audience, as I'm going, let me know. Number one, do these episodes sound good? Number two, give it give it a grade. Give it a grade. All right. All right. Here we go. So, uh, first it gave me a summary. All right. Uh, let's see. Oh, is this the right one? Yes, it did. Okay. So, what's interesting is it said, \"I've analyzed Jordan's Everyday AI newsletter archive also has cataloged 500 podcast episodes,\" which I didn't even ask it to do, right? I just asked it to find the corresponding uh podcast episodes for the uh leverage newsletter documents. So, there's probably about 80 of those. So it went ahead and it did a little more work, which is great. Uh, and it also researched uh 2025 trends. So it found uh so it bulletpointed uh some of the um uh some of its findings uh dropped some uh guest database. Okay, so here we go. So step one, here's the 10 mashup episode ideas and outlines. Okay, so the first one, uh it says AI agents corporate identity crisis. And it says uh I should combine a recent episode I did with Sarah Bird from Microsoft and Ron Green from Kung Fu AI. Um and it gave me three episode uh title options. Pretty good. Uh and then it gave me an angle. It gave me a micro script. And this microscript is garbage. Uh sorry. People love to think like Claude is some great content writer. It's it's it's extremely average. Uh and then here we go. Give me the guest list. All right. So, uh, for the outline, seems like it did a pretty good job. Let's let's keep going. Um, so number two, it says the great AI coding takeover. Uh, it didn't combine guests. It just combined uh topics that I've covered. That's okay. That was allowed. Uh, and then on guest list, it's just kind of combining uh some of my recent uh episodes. So, not bad. Number three, AI Research Revolution from Garbage to Gold. Uh, let's see. Same thing. Uh, give me give me the title options. Uh, guest list. Okay, here we go. Give me just one. Give me one guest. And then it gave me uh two of my own episodes. So, if I were to run this again, I would make I would give more strict rules. I would say uh either, you know, it's a kind of a Jordanon episode or it needs to have at least three guests, right? So, uh, you know, unfortunately, these aren't the best, but that was probably due to my prompt. Uh, not any, uh, anything from Claude, but hopefully we get a couple more here. Uh, so number four, the job security death match. Uh, again, just one uh, guest. So, yeah, unfortunately uh, this run, which is interesting because I ran this one earlier and I think it actually did a better job. But, you know, that's the uh, the generative part of generative AI. All right. So, so far, eh, you know, uh, I wish I wish I would have run this with a little more specificity uh in the guest list with some requirements uh and then we would have seen some uh hopefully better results. However, you know, overall I think it did do a a decent enough job. I would probably give it like a C+ or a B minus on this. It did everything. Uh, actually, I'll say I'll say a B because probably the things that I'm not liking were things that I could have done better. All right, step two. Here's the difficult thing. Can it build a legit script and weave in actual quotes? Um, and I did say you need to include at least 12 total quotes. Uh, I should have designated that these need to be actual non-fabricated quotes. All right, so let's see if it did.\nUh, so yeah, I believe it made it up. Uh, so what it did is it took my writing uh from the uh from the newsletter and it attributed that to a quote to the guest. So again, not good uh because Yeah, not good. All right. So, um, again, probably my fault though, right? I would run this again and probably probably do a little bit better. All right. So, unfortunately, this first uh or this most recent go-round did not do great. Um, let me do uh let me just go ahead and share this this previous one. So, I did run the exact same one right before. I thought it did a little bit better. Uh, let me just go ahead and scroll through uh to our kind of step two and see if it actually did better. Or maybe I was just uh a little more impressed the first time around.\nUm, okay. So, yes, on this one it actually did it correctly. Uh, so, uh, in this one, you know, it says, uh, here's an episode for AI agents everywhere, the 100 billion dollar workforce revolution. So, it wrote a script for me. So, uh, what if I told you, all right, here's the intro. Let me know. Does this sound good? Like something I would say. What if I told you by the end of 2025, your company could have digital workers with their own corporate IDs, AI avatars closing deals at 25% the cost of human sales teams, and autonomous agents inspecting hotel rooms better than six-month veterans? That's not science fiction. That's today's business reality. I hate that intro. Um, sounds like AI. Doesn't sound like me, but maybe it's better than me. I don't know. Uh, okay. Uh, then it went and it correctly it started to write transitions and then it started to pull actual quotes from the episode pages that I originally uh wanted. So, let me just see if this is correct. So, this is uh Natalie uh Natalie from episode 371. All right. Uh, so let's see if Claude made anything up. So it said uh she said right. It's like uh so this is baby formula for me as a mom. Okay. So I'm going to just take that because it's a very uh specific thing that we would not normally talk about in a podcast and I want to make sure that Claude is correctly pulling this information. So the good thing is is it gave me the citation. So I can go in here. Here's our episode page transcript. There's a lot of information on here. All right. Bam. Look at that. All right. So, the good thing is on the previous one that I ran, it actually did it correctly and it's pulling actual um quotes from multiple guests and it's piecing them together. Uh, so, y'all, generative AI is generative and it looks like uh it did a pretty good job. And then uh uh it put in another quote here from a different one with Al Lagunas. Um a different quote there. So, very good. So, the first run on this did better. All right. Uh, but that's the that's the downside of generative AI. Yeah. So um and then let's go ahead and look at the third one uh as we wrap up today's show. So this is the 10 new episodes uh according to maybe gaps I've missed. So uh number one it's the $300 billion AI infrastructure race. Uh who's building the future? Uh two AI agents in healthcare the two trillion dollar opportunity. Three, the AI creativity paradox when machines make art. So, yeah, pretty good stuff. I'm not going to go through and read all 10 of them. Uh, but it did go through. It gave me ideas. It gave me a little bit of background. Uh, it gave me a very rough episode outline. Not very good, but it gave me a rough one. And then it also gave me um ideas for actual guests uh to use as well uh to to reach out to. So, I would have to see if these are actual people. So, let's just see. For number two, it says AI agents in healthcare, the $2 trillion opportunity. And it said talk to Dr. Regina uh Barzille uh MIT AI healthcare and it gave me her uh Twitter. I'm guessing this might be a hallucination. Uh so let's see if it actually is or not. All right. So I just Googled that. Doesn't look So it looks like this is an actual person. Uh but I don't think that's uh her actual uh you know Twitter uh Twitter handle. Yeah, it doesn't look like it. So, um, gave me actual information for a real person, but it made up their Twitter handle. So, again, uh, it's not 100% accurate. Uh, I would obviously go through and improve some things, uh, before running this again. But overall, live stream audience, what do you think? What do you think? All right. Don't just think of my uh, haphazardly thrown together, right? This just came out less than 24 hours ago. I wanted to bring this to you right away. Right? If I was doing an actual use case of this, I would go through at least 10\n\n\n times and\nrefine that prompt, make that process\nbetter.\nUh, go through, see where it went\nwrong, and make sure I get it right\nbefore I even ran it as a use case or a\npilot.\nBut I'm pretty impressed, right?\nAnd the one it got right, not the one I\ndid live, but the previous one, it\nactually did one of the hardest things,\nand it did it correctly, which was going\nthrough uh more than 80 newsletter\npieces that I've written.\nIt went and it found the corresponding um on its\nown.\nI didn't tell it where it was.\nIt went and found it on its own.\nIt read through the transcript.\nIt pulled out actual quotes from multiple different\nguests, and it pieced them all together.\nThat is dang impressive, y'all.\nThat is really impressive, right?\nBecause then in theory, I could probably figure out\nhow to use something like, you know,\nDescript.\nThey have their new AI uh\neditor.\nI could probably somehow figure\nout to just have Descript go put it all\ntogether, right?\nSo, again, this is not\nperfect, but probably with another two\nto three hours of refinement, uh, I\ncould probably make this work really,\nreally well.\nAnd I wouldn't have it do\n10.\nI would have it do three at a time.\nUh, and I think just that would save me\ndozens of\nhours.\nThis is huge.\nThis is huge.\nIs it perfect?\nNo.\nIs it changing how we should think about\nwork?\nAbso freakingutely.\nRight y'all, I\ntold you this has literally been in my\nClickUp like project list, episode list\nfor 18 months.\nAnd to tell you the\ntruth, it's it it was it's getting over\nit was getting overwhelming for me to\neven think about, but I know like man,\nI'm like I like I think about it.\nI'm\nlike, yo, I'm sitting on so much great\ncontent.\nI've been so lucky to interview\nsome of the smartest people in the\nworld, right?\nAnd sometimes every once\nin a while, I'll like replay an episode,\nbut I keep thinking like there's got to\nbe a way to just bring in, right, bits\nand pieces from different people and\nweave it all together.\nAnd I'm like, I\ncould go and do that, right?\nI'm a\njournalist.\nThat's what I used to do.\nI\nwould interview 20 people, you know,\npull together their quotes, you know,\nget the glue together and hopefully put\ntogether a nice story that taught people\nsomething.\nIt's time consuming.\nI know\nhow timeconuming this is.\nTo do this at\nscale to do one of those episodes would\nprobably take me at least five hours\nbecause I got to go through and either\nlisten to the episode, read the\ntranscript, or throw the transcript\nmanually, right?\nOr let's just say\nyou're not using AI at all.\nthat to to\nput one episode together would take me\n10 hours.\nUsing AI, it would probably\ntake me three hours.\nUsing a tool like\nthis, a deep research tool with aentic\ntool use that connects and integrates\nlive with your data.\nLike I said, I\nrefine it a little bit and then I I have\na good version within 20 minutes, right?\nSo, the time savings on that is huge.\nSo, think I gave you my example on on AI\nwork Wednesdays.\nWhat's your example?\nWhat are you going to do?\nI'd love to\nhear from you.\nLet me know.\nAlso, hey,\nthis new segment, just trying it out.\nYes or no?\nLet me know.\nYes or no?\nDoes\nit stink?\nShould we do
