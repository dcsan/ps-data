  "cleanText": "Our whole mission is to enable brands of all sizes to get Amazon-like delivery speeds, costs, and consumer experiences. The point of online commerce is really that a consumer no longer is walking into a store and experiencing your brand and getting that trust and that essence of \"I want to shop at this place.\" Instead, your delivery experience is that modern storefront. If you think about businesses in this market segment, you know, scale really matters. The exciting thing about Store and the way that Sean Henry has operated the business is even though we have a ton of capital on the balance sheet, we operate as if it's like our last capital in a sense. It's called \"bounder mode\" because I think it's taking you back to like day one of the business where you do everything and you're involved in everything. You also have to build a culture where they like working on the hard things. We're locked in. We're not giving up. We're pushing harder than ever, and that it is time to get serious.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome to Grit. I'm Joubin Mirzadegan, partner at Kleiner Perkins, a show where we go beyond the highlight reel and explore the personal and professional challenges of building history-making companies. Today on Grit, we have Sean Henry, co-founder and CEO of Store. Sean launched the company when he was only 18 years old and became the youngest unicorn CEO in tech. Since his first appearance on the show over three years ago, Sean has raised $200 million series E and scaled into a leading cloud supply chain platform powering fulfillment and operations for some of the fastest growing e-commerce brands in the country. We are also joined by my partner Ilya Fushman and special guest. Enjoy the episode. Should I start with an embarrassing story about myself as we were talking about Atlanta? Sure. Okay. So, do you remember this story? Oh, I know. Sean, it was uh like co-ish time. Me, Sean, Garrett Langley, who else? Wasn't it Joe Thomas? Joe from Atlassian Loom. Yeah. The four of us. Four of us I'm treating go to dinner in Atlanta. Mhm. And Garrett picks the nice old school steakhouse. Yeah. Garrett from Flock Safety. Yeah. Is from there. And he's like, \"You know, my family's been going to this restaurant for decades. We have to go. I'll take care of us.\" And I'm like, \"Great, that sounds nice.\" And again, this is like just coming off of the heels of co like in the Bay Area. Like there's no such thing as a dress code anyway. And in co especially okay so I'm in a black t-shirt which during like that time was basically KP, that was that was our attire, still most wearing one now, and that's tech tech fancy. Exactly. So I show up I think I'm with I'm with Garrett. We show up. Yeah. I missed the snap through. I think it was you two. Okay. And then the maitre d' is like, \"Oh sir, um where's your collar?\" And I'm like, \"What collar?\" And he's like, \"You don't have a collar.\" And I'm like, \"No, no, but like, you know, I'm I'm like I'm hosting like kind of like, please don't make this a thing type thing. Like, please don't like don't embarrass me right now, you know?\" And he's like, \"Uh, no, no, like I'm sorry.\" Like, this is like old school Atlanta. Sure. And he's like, \"I need a wears a straw hat. I need you to wear a collar.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" Like, \"Well, I don't have one.\" And Jared's like, \"No, it's fine. I'll call my grandpa.\" point. I'm like, \"Oh my god.\" Like, \"I'll just go get a collar.\" So, he's like, \"Oh, there's a there's a golf store just like right around the corner.\" I'm like, \"Perfect. I'll just go get a golf pillow.\" Do they try to offer you a house jacket or something? It was like xxx. That's right. They offer me like this giant and I'm like, \"I can't take your This is crazy. I got to get out of here.\" So, I go to the golf store and I'm like, \"It's fine. I'll wear like a nice polo. It'll be all good.\" They were closed. They're closing and I'm like, \"I'll pay anything. Please, like, let me in here.\" They're like, \"I'm sorry. There's a FUBO store across the street. just go to the foo just go to the foo store and I'm like I didn't even know that was still a chain and I was like it's like Damon John's like anyway and so I was like okay so I go to the foo store they're about to close and I'm like any colored shirt don't care just needs to fit me and the only collared shirt that they had was a small and which is odd for a foo store which is odd yeah and so I was like okay I'll take it I literally didn't have a choice like you missed the one requirement that it fits me I roll back in. Garrett has like his fancy wine and he's, you know, holding court and the three of the guys, Joe, Sean, they're all sitting there and I show up in a purple small foo shirt bursting at the seams. Bursting at the Is there a picture of this? I don't know if I have. I sent you a picture and strategically you couldn't tell what I was what I was wearing. He played it off very nicely. He was he stayed happy, everything. But every time after I saw him, he was like, \"That damn restaurant we went to ruined my experience.\" That was a low point at that point in Store. Like you had just raised a D, a C? I think the D I think that was early 2022 and like everything was cooking like things were going up and to the right or were things starting to had the macro slowed down? I think it was slowing down at that point because I think that was like mid 2022 for us. It was like Q1, Q2 of 2022 where we started to more like see the external signals from investors, from the macro, where interest rates were going, less like actual impacts in the business, more like starting to shield. In the second half of that year is where we definitely saw more of the freight rates come down, less volume coming into the market, brands getting slower to make decisions. So, I'd say we're at an interesting point. We're coming off of multiple years of cooking and kind of looking at a more uncertain few uh periods ahead. And you had just raised the D at that point. Yeah. And so you raised this huge round right before the macro is about to take a nose dive. Good timing. Great timing in retrospect. And then what happens? Like you call like what's your course of action when it becomes very obvious that you're about to go into a very different environment where interest rates are high, you can't raise money, and by the way, this was a very capital intensive business at that point. What's your course of action? Yeah, we were coming off 2021 with just so much growth over the last few years from COVID. So much evolution in our business model, but honestly, we're also right at the kind of pinnacle point of in the infrastructure in this business. It's also a J curve. You have to invest to build out a network to get efficiency, capital intensity. And so we were kind of uh peeking into the the lowest point of that trough and saying, \"Oh, this is great timing with the the macro.\" Peeking into the trough. That's a good one. And instead of bottoming out, compliment making it making it sound good.\nI'm going to use that.\nYeah, it's a CEO spin. Yeah. Uh but uh so we we saw that and we kind of said, okay, if we're hearing all this macro uncertainty, if we think the venture market's headed this direction, particularly because of interest rates and IPOs and more, we should probably get a fortress-like balance sheet to kind of weather the storm. So the kind of D2 extension was only 3 four months after uh Kleiner Perkins led the initial D and that was where we had multiple term sheets incredibly hot market and we said well let's just go back and anyone we kind of weren't able to partner with we cut the round size off let's let them back in and it was a key decision at the point because we were saying do we need this dilution we already have a lot of capital on hand and we were saying well we want to prioritize building the best possible business and not being limited by capital and having to make too short-term of decisions over the next few years. So, let's go all in. And and we did. And I think right after that, it became even more obvious how starkly the market was turning. And it wasn't a micro pivot. It was a kind of extreme uh course correction. And that's when we ended up very glad we did it, but it also came with a lot of resetting. And I think one of thinking all the way back one of the best things one of our uh seed investors Chad at SUSA advised when we closed that round he was like I want you to call all the investors and say what is like the main metric we're all agreed on working backwards from from our series to get to series A our next round and let's make sure we're all in lock step and kind of tried to take that approach where we said hey let's call everyone and make sure everyone's aligned like the markets changed that last model we had where we were going to go burn a lot of money over the next few years to get to this max point of scale is probably different because it's probably not fundable and sustainable. We want to build a model that kind of threads the needle correctly. So here's the four or five metrics we think that matter over the next 2 three year period that we think it equals we're building a great business creating a lot of value from things like our revenue scale and margins and kind of uh sales and marketing success and efficiency like few metrics we kind of aligned on at a board and said if we all agree on this this is kind of how we're going to charge over the next few years and I'd say it was pretty scary at the time because you put all those out and a lot of them were bright red and saying uh trust us we're going to get this to a key point Then you zoom out 2 three years later and now we're sitting in those board meetings and they're either all bright green or almost green and we're saying it's probably time to revise them to kind of the next phase ahead. Were either of you worried they were going to pull the term sheet because hey this is different than what we expected.\nUh I mean I I think maybe Sean really had the foresight to do the incremental raise and candidly I was maybe on the opposite side. We we had a long discourse where you know you didn't want the dilution. Not necessarily just that illusion, but more it felt like, hey, we have real operating leverage. Like, why do we need the capital? We could, you know, potentially wait, grow the business into it and raise more more capital. And I think you had the foresight of saying, look, the macro is pretty unstable here. Um, we we probably should shore up the balance sheet even more because we'd raised a pretty sizable round for the company at the at the series. How big was that? $90 million, but call it less than a year after our $65 million. So, you still had a bunch of that money in the bank. So, we had a huge balance sheet. I actually think I made a great point at that time too which is not necessarily dilution but uh with too much money in the bank you may also make worse decisions some capital constraint is not the worst idea in the world and that was probably the tension we were thinking through more of can we load up the balance sheet of this size and still operate with discipline. If you think about businesses in this in this market segment, you know, scale really matters, right? Both topline operating scale and just the scale of of footprint which is relevant for customers and you can really get over your skis if you sort of say hey like scale business scale is all I care about uh because I'll make up the economics down the line at better scale. I can negotiate better. I can have uh better customer kind of offerings. I can get bigger customers because they care about the scale. And that's a risky proposition if you just operate on scale alone. And you know obviously you have a have a founder and CEO who has that frame of mind to say look like we'll get the capital. We will eventually get to the right scale but we got to do it in a profitable way which is you know kudos to Sean. He's done that in a pretty incredible way. Is raising too much money a VC's way of saying no more dilution but disguised as hey capital constraints matter. cuz I could see both sides of the book being talked depending on if you're the one trying to put more money versus if you're the one trying to\nYeah. It's always when you're when you're trying to invest, you always want people to take more money in when you're on the receiving side of it. You're like maybe you don't want Exactly. I it comes I I'd say look at that these stages later stages of growth um you know the the relative dilution is not I mean it's it's always meaningful but it's not that meaningful. Um it's really for me at least comes back to given the capital you know even if you take the incremental capital do you have the rigor to operate the business efficiently and in a way that you really should be. Um and this is comes back to the constraints breed u innovation and constraints uh really make you focused on what matters in the business. Uh and having access to a large pool of capital you know sometimes can get you to be a little loose on those constraints because you have the dollars. It's the same concept as you know if you have a big venture fund um you know an incremental small check doesn't feel that difficult. So do you you know relax your constraints uh in how you think about the incremental investment. You really shouldn't right every dollar really matters. Uh and so I think the same applies to to operating a business. you know, treating every dollar as if it's really scarce allows you to then build a better, more efficient business and that actually create more leverage, infinitely more leverage on the capital that you have and obviously that then leads to a good step up in your growth of your business, good step up in valuation and ultimately results when all is said and done in the full course of time in\n\n\nLess dilution for the business.\nSo it's just rigor at the end of the day, and I think, um, you know, it's the exciting thing about Stord and the way that the team has operated the business is, even though we have a ton of capital on the balance sheet, we operate as if it's like our last capital in a sense, right?\nUm, and that's led to the company hitting profitability, understanding its growth levers, being able to scale this business much more efficiently, you know, frankly, than we had been doing in the past.\nAnd I think that ultimately, when all said and done, results in way less dilution for all the shareholders to the business.\nMhm.\nI think at certain points like that, you can step back and stay in these late growth rounds, just giving a range.\nIf we're going to take 5 to 15% dilution to secure the future of this mission and what we've all built at this point, it's a lot more understandable.\nIt's really that tension of when you have that huge balance sheet, can you operate with discipline?\nAnd uh, it's not even necessarily like the founder tension, like it goes down throughout the team.\nWhen you have so much capital, when you've announced these big raises, everyone's mind changes around capital availability.\nAnd we had to do some hard things, like we made all those calls and said, \"Hey, the path forward is a little different.\nWe want to focus on, yes, scale, but not scale at all costs.\nWe want to prove the economic leverage of this business.\nWe want to prove that we're not using venture dollars to subsidize rapid deliveries.\nThis is real value we're providing to customers and real sustainable unit economics.\"\nAnd you get to a point of profitability like today.\nAnd that's very proven, but at the time there's a lot of kind of trust and watch the proof points along the way as we progress.\nBut you have that tension of these hard decisions, like we just raised this massive round of capital, and within a few months, is not a thing I'm proud to say, but we had to take the hard actions.\nWe did a reduction in our team only one or two months after announcing this big round.\nAnd the tension there of, wait, why do we have so much capital, yet we're spending less?\nI just don't understand it.\nTo say just because we have a lot of capital doesn't mean we have permanent capital at this type of rate and this type of efficiency.\nAnd so I think as a founder, the hardest thing in those times is almost to just like deconstruct what you've thought was right for the last however many years.\nWhat got you to this point?\nThe different, let's say, ratios of how you're hiring to revenue growth and how you're building teams and kind of just start questioning everything and acting like these are your last dollars and saying at some point venture is really supposed to be a system where when you know you put a quarter in one side, you crank a machine and get a dollar out the other side.\nWell, there's a point where a lot of people are putting a dollar in to get less than a dollar out, saying, \"Well, once the machine's ready, it will spit out more on the other side.\"\nAnd I think you had to kind of return to that art of like, well, let's actually make sure every incremental dollar we're putting in is returning something in a high way, whether in terms of new revenue growth, margin expansion, profit expansion, new product lines, and just driving a lot of mid and bottom line rigor.\nAnd just to level set because it's been several years since we've had you on the show, what is Stord and then maybe in the context of like why is this capital requirement so interesting through that lens of your business?\nYeah, absolutely.\nOur whole mission is to enable brands of all sizes to get Amazon-like delivery speeds, costs, and consumer experiences.\nThe point of online commerce is really that a consumer no longer is walking into a store and experiencing your brand and getting that trust and that essence of I want to shop at this place.\nInstead, your delivery experience is that modern storefront where that shows is this a brand I trust?\nDo they have a great operation?\nDoes the quality of their delivery match the quality of the product I want?\nAnd so it's the battleground today.\nHowever, it's very different to invest in building out one beautiful storefront and building out nationwide next day, two-day trusted delivery.\nAnd the biggest companies out there have spent tens to even hundreds of billions of dollars doing so.\nAnd in many ways, it just is a scale business.\nThe more volume you have, the lower cost per order, the faster speed per order, the more technology you can build around it.\nAnd so there's this very kind of uneven playing field where the smallest and midsize brands have the highest customer acquisition cost in the first place compared to these major platforms and then they're losing on one of the most critical consumer experience vectors that now contributes to 40% of incart conversion and 80% of repeat shopping rates while driving 15 to 20% of costs in a brand and in a physical business.\nSo our whole model is really lowering the cost, increasing the speed, delighting the consumer through both an end-to-end fulfillment network and a vertically integrated software platform that runs the assets, orchestrates the network, and then delights the consumer with promises, tracking, returns, portals, and more.\nAnd so in a scale business, and we just zoom out in 2021, we delivered 2 three million packages.\nToday we're on track to deliver almost 50 million packages this year.\nAnd the speed associated with those deliveries is almost three days faster over that same three, four year period.\nThe kind of costs per unit is 30, 40% cheaper over that same time horizon.\nAnd so that's where you can really point to, hey, look, the flywheel and economies of scale are paying off.\nBut if you look at the business and the size and shape and kind of what we've built to the capital we've raised and consumed, having raised $400 million and having consumed a part of that but not the majority, um, it really, I think, is a pretty capital efficient model we've been able to build out when you compare it to the tens of billions that have been invested in this by the giants.\nWe're just so deeply convicted in the long-term mission that you also lean in and say, do I believe this trend is here to stay and we can build a massive business with it?\nYes.\nOkay.\nWell, do I think my probability of success with that is higher with me in the business or outside the business?\nAnd uh maybe different people's answers vary on that.\nFor me, it was in the business.\nAnd uh honestly, I'll give a lot of credit to people like Ilya, too, who I probably did ask that question multiple times early on of like, is there doubt?\nDo you uh trust my leadership over this kind of course we have to navigate ahead?\nAnd uh I remember Ilya basically saying that at Kleiner Perkins, we've only ever seen it go horribly wrong when you replace the CEO.\nAnd we're going down with the ship.\nNumber one thing is go down with the ship basically.\nAnd uh no, uh that's not our view.\nAnd so I think that kind of gives you a lot of trust and confidence that uh yes, we have hard discussions.\nYes, we're always pushing ourselves and our investors to be the best we possibly can, but we also are kind of on a team and navigating those waters together.\nAnd so I think that when you kind of compare the options, uh I knew a lot of founders who in that same time period said maybe I'll step out and go hire the professional CEO.\nI don't know any data points I could point to where that worked incredibly well.\nAnd I think it's just you lose that context of everything that's gone on the business to date and also that passion and drive forward.\nAnd so you don't necessarily have the motivation, but you also don't have all the insight on what you need to fix.\nIf I went and hired someone, they probably would have needed multiple quarters even to know what to go fix versus the context of well here's the biggest problems right now.\nAnd I think the the kind of most proud moment for me is not making the changes.\nIt's looking back over those two, three years and saying like, okay, we made a lot of hard decisions.\nIt wasn't even always clear at the time that this is going to head to the right direction and is paying off the same way we want.\nWe stayed convicted and kind of kept flashing the same here's where we are, here's what we said 22 was going to be versus 23 kind of thematically.\nAnd then getting to the other side and seeing those vectors turn green or those qualities turn green or getting to profit and otherwise makes you go, \"Wow, really paid off and we're glad we took those hard actions and stayed course.\"\nI think, you know, like this is a complicated business.\nUm, and I would say, uh, since the series A in 2019, right, we always made the number, but not but never quite how we thought we were going to do it.\nI think that's like the recurring history maybe until like basically I might get a tattoo of Ilya saying that because uh, it is the recurring history basically until like 2024.\nYeah, 2024.\nUh and I think a lot of that just had to do with with all the learning, um, because the company started with a fully virtualized distributed thirdparty logistics network, went to having owned warehouse footprint including the third party platform, um, you know, figuring out what to do with freight, um, figuring out how do you sell to the ideal ICP.\nAnd I think I, you know, the biggest, but coming back to kind of the the point on on founder CEO, the biggest pivotal moment for me I think was uh Sean really going, you know, what is it?\nFounder mode and and actually taking over the sales leadership role, nailing and closing uh key large customer deals, really going deep on kind of rebuilding the sales function.\nUm then doing the same thing on the product side essentially, right?\nAnd so like through 2020, late 23, 2024, you basically had Sean go founder mode on each core function, sales, customer support, success, uh warehouse operations with Steve, who's who's phenomenal, and then uh product and engineering, marketing, uh and then kind of really taking all the learnings over the years and kind of culminating what the company is today.\nAnd now really operating with a clear here's the plan, here's how we're going to hit the numbers and actually delivering on that.\nAnd that that takes a lot of work and I think you can't really replace that, abdicate that, abstract that away.\nAnd certainly if you bring in an exact to try to figure all that out, you can't get the four year, five years of learning uh or more obviously since founding the company to all be done in in a couple of quarters.\nSo I think that's that's what makes every one of these businesses really unique is that that process.\nWhen Sean comes to you, Ilya, and he's like, \"Am I the guy?\"\nLike, that's a pretty tough conversation.\nYou've been doing this since you were like 18 years old.\nLike, this is literally your life.\nWhen somebody comes to you, like your instinct is like obviously to be supportive, but you also deep down are like, I don't know, like I don't know how this business is going to turn out, you know, like I have no idea.\nHow often does that happen?\nFirst of all, first of all, it almost never happens.\nThat seems deeply introspective.\nYeah, that seems very self-aware to me.\nI do remember you going, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa.\"\nSean is deeply introspective.\nUh, you know, I think there's probably two times that's ever happened to me in my history of investing.\nTo be clear, I wasn't saying I wanted it.\nI was saying,\nI mean, my first reaction was, \"This is a really complicated business.\nI don't even know who else could run it.\"\nUh, so it's a good problem to corner yourself into a permanent job.\nCreates so much complexity that no one else can unbundle it.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nSo that's number one.\nYou know, I think it goes back to fundamentals like, hey, do we do we think this is going to be a big company, a big business, a big opportunity?\nE-commerce is is massive.\nAs Sean put it, do brands need to replace the historic storefront instore experience they had where people could really feel and and sort of connect with the brand with the equivalent for for online and delivery, you know?\nAbsolutely.\nYes.\nUm, do we understand the core components of this business across fulfillment, freight, uh, you know, warehousing, software, order management system, warehouse management system, like the combined power of a great software platform with the logistics infrastructure, like yes, like this should exist and should work is the answer you come to.\nAnd then it's sort of like, hey, what do we really need to to make this operate and and succeed?\nUm, and it goes back to you need, you know, a leader who has been and steeped in this, who understands the nuances of building something that's truly new and unique and differentiated in the space.\nUm, and so, yeah, like you can't replace that.\nUm, and it's not like you can go and get an off-the-shelf executive to go to go run this.\nUm, and I think the conversation we ultimately had was, hey, um, it's great to be self-aware.\nIt's great.\nIt's great to be introspective and like let's go and essentially look at all the pieces that need to work for this to happen, right?\nAnd that's, you know, go to market.\nThat's um your fulfillment, freight warehousing, infrastructure.\nWhat do we do with freight?\nIt's the software piece that, you know, we've made, you've made really incredible uh progress in.\nAnd really, let's be patient, um is kind of the the core point.\nAnd let's not try to get to some mega scale at all costs by selling dollars for 90 cents, right?\nAnd let's just understand that this business is going to compound and I think the real sort of core of it was, you know, we're operating in a in a physical economy kind of logistics space and the software space, let's make sure, I think the conversation we had was like, let's make sure that we have a killer logistics business and that you can build that, like you know how to build, there's examples of that, you understand the metrics that matter for that, let's let's do that first and foremost and then build kind of the the cherry on top piece of that, which has been kind of the plan, right?\nI think it's really that kind of going back to fundamentals, uh knowing that we have a strong balance sheet, again, kudos to Sean for for having the insight, the foresight for that, and that we can take our time and be patient, and I think that's probably the most critical piece here.\nYeah, I give Ilya a lot of credit in that period for both that founder conversation because you\n\n\nalso pushed hard on basically, uh, well, you've gotten us here, and it clearly proves, let's say, uh, you're right on more than 50% of decisions or something like that. And, um, at the same time, uh, I think you use the statement, like, \"Don't let the tail wag the dog.\" Don't let your all your investors and your employees tell you where the business is headed. You, uh, we trust the plan. So, like, have conviction and and push forward on these these factors. And I think we step back and we say, \"Okay, well, make that multi-year strategic plan and say, 'Well, first, let's uh, shore up, uh, whether it's our, uh, uh, product, let's say, and our value prop for our ICP. Then let's shore up these kind of unit economic elements of the business and kind of take the gloves off team by team and problem by problem.'\" And I think that as a young founder and CEO, I saw a quote from a leader at Amazon actually recently, which was like, \"My biggest worry for young, uh, founders and CEOs or executives is you think you're supposed to hire the best possible team and kind of get out of their way. No, your job is to raise the bar on them every single day, push them to be better and faster than they ever thought possible, keep them aligned to the mission.\" And I think myself included failed at that in those early 2019, 2020. You're hiring like crazy, you're growing like crazy. There seems to be unlimited capital. You hire all these really big leaders and kind of say they'll figure it out and they can run that team. And then you really start to like introspect and say, \"Well, if I know the mission and the problem and the customer better than anyone, and I have kind of good scrappy entrepreneurial frameworks about what does good look like, how fast should we move, these types of things. No matter what team it is, from, uh, product to engineering to to sales to inbuilding operations, you can kind of get in there and verify and push and hold teams more and more accountable.\" And, uh, it almost feels like playing whack-a-mole where you're like, \"All right, this is the problem. Now, this is the problem now. This is the problem.\" But over a multi-year period, it all really clicks together. And I think for a business like us too, I think a hard part is every entrepreneur, uh, well, maybe not every, I think it's a high probability, you want some sort of flywheel in your business. And we were kind of pitching this, like, as we get to more scale, we'll get lower cost, higher speed. Our software will drive this leverage in our variable economics and our actual performance metrics, and we'll get all this consumer trust where we're now shipping to some 15 plus% of U.S. households per year. We're trying to build that trust and that repeatability. Early on, you're like, there will be a flywheel. Trust it. And then at some point, you finally start to see the metrics click together and come together. And I think that's really what we saw towards the end of '23, beginning of '24, was that flywheel actually playing off where every customer, uh, new order that came in drove so many structural advantages in in our business. Um, and so I think when you when you step back, that enables a lot more confidence to then push far forward into that flywheel even faster while you try to keep the same, uh, uh, kind of controls and efficiency that you're driving in the business day to day. Last night we were at dinner with a bunch of CEOs and founders, and Sean Henry was there, and I was like off to the side eating food or something, and I like there's kind of like a queue of founders waiting to go talk to Sean, which was kind of a funny moment that, like, he's the old head now, and like people like look up to him, you know, and are like the founder that kind of they want to be one day. Not to gas you up too much, but we were talking after, and you were like going through all the excruciating detail over the last few years as you described of whack-a-mole, and like whack-a-mole kind of glosses over how hard you have to whack the moles, you know, and like how painful that actually is over several years. And we have counter examples of, I think, a lot of founders that were unwilling to play whack-a-mole over these last few years. And I think now their business is not in the same shape as where Stord is. And I give you a lot of credit for for doing that because I think it's not easy. But do you think that maybe for both of you the market changed? It was very obvious that the market changed. Every SAS company, every logistics company, like, they had to run their business differently. Everybody was running way too hot. AI was coming and now like very clearly here. And in many ways, like some people just haven't responded in the same way. Do you think it's the unwillingness to play whack-a-mole because it's so painful to like make all of these changes in your business? I think in many ways you have to kind of break down your ego, go back to that early, it's called founder mode because I think it's taking you back to like day one of the business where you do everything and you're involved in everything. And I, I don't think I can sit here and proclaim that I'm, uh, holier than now, better than founders who didn't do it, uh, because I just think it is very hard, and you have to be kind of willing to be that one in every meeting going through every single headcount, every single expense, every single customer and saying why, why, why over and over. And it's not like a fun position to be in necessarily. There's this constant tension with you. And you almost have to like kill the early optimistic founder review that was just everything's up and to the right, everything's optimisms, uh, selling and go into like very aggressive operator mode and make sure we know every single metric on every single aspect of the business. But why is that hard? Like, is it the, like, what makes that hard? I think it's both throwing out so much that you prior did and thought you were creating something great. You thought you structured this great team, this great product, this great segment of your business. So, like, for us, uh, we had a trucking segment of our business. We ended up closing it and saying, \"This is kind of incongruent with the rest of our model. We love fulfillment. We love last mile. We'll do the middle mile to kind of sort and rebalance inventory, but kind of standalone trucking, it's not really for us. It's not the same kind of commerce enablement as the rest of our platform. It was incredibly hot and requested from customers during 2020 when capacity was so tight, but it's not the same kind of value-add service.\" Well, that was a business that, I mean, actually we went to bat on of, uh, knowing bad examples of trucking business that haven't gone well. My advocation for, \"No, no, no, this is why we have to do it,\" all the way to circle back to, \"I was wrong. We should close this down.\" Multiple years of my time and energy, let's throw it away. So, I think you kind of have to, uh, be willing to break things you prior thought were great and or just live in that place that doesn't necessarily isn't congruent with your personality. I think a lot of founders are optimists. You're a builder. You want to go talk to customers and employees and push, push, push and build something great. And that is kind of incongruent with like being that daily operator just pushing and being pessimistic on every number and being conservative. But I think going back to the point you said on, \"Let's first build an incredible logistics business.\" It also became kind of, \"What's the best thing I could do for my employees and my investors?\" And we kind of said very transparently internally, \"Here's what we're going through. Here's where we're trying to get,\" and externally. And we said, \"Well, how do we create the most, the best situation for everyone?\" Which we thought was kind of limited downside, unlimited upside, so some asymmetric, uh, kind of risk and saying, \"Well, what's really happening to most companies that are in a bad spot today? It's either that they have too high of a burn and they're going to be insolvent in some period of time or that they're never going to be able to get to a size and scale that substantiates either their valuation or their kind of capital raised in their prep stack.\" Those are the two main issues people are talking about over the last few years. Well, how do we like take those off the the table? Well, one is we can get profitable, and two is we can build a business the size that even in like our worst case is bigger and better than our prep stack or our valuation or otherwise. So that was kind of our, \"Let's just build a fundamentally great business,\" and then kind of go for the moonshot once we have this profit, once we have this scale. They're not mutually exclusive, but like, let's focus on the blocking and tackling. And I think Ilya Fushman started to introduce the kind of like, \"in the fullness of time\" concept in more board meetings, like, \"That's great, and we absolutely should do that, but if that's going to light X money on fire today, like, that's probably once we've solved foundational piece.\" And so then once we get to this point where we have what we believe is the best fulfillment network available from a customer feedback and experience perspective, a speed perspective, a cost perspective, a reputation with brands, and we we came such a far away. Well, not only do we have a great business that's now 10 times plus the scale of when we did our last round prior in those 2021 and two times profitable with raving customer reviews, growing faster than ever, uh, 70 to 100% a year at hundreds of millions in scale. Uh, we feel like we, uh, hit foundation, which is capped downside. Now we're in uncapped upside mode where if unlimited time and the foundation we've built, there's no question we can build this massive, massive, massive business. And so I think that was important at least to me. I hope it came across to our investors that this is the best asymmetric risk I profile can create for investors, employees, my customers, and and everyone involved. Yeah, I think it it can feel like what as as a, you know, the founder, I'm sure you have somewhere like a whiteboard or a list of things that Stord could do and could be right, like your big vision. And I think having fundamentally doing these resets, um, headcount reductions, you know, killing a product line can feel like you're actually, um, preventing yourself from achieving that big vision. I can feel like, \"Hey, like, uh, actually my my vision was too big, my my business may be smaller than I thought.\" Um, and I think that's a very painful thing to try to just kind of go through and think and reason about, uh, because you have this opportunity and you feel it, and you're when you're a high-growth company. I think the biggest thing there is just understanding that that sequencing really matters and is crucial. And I think, you know, you look at at the iconic companies out there, you look at at a Microsoft, you know, you look at um, an Apple, these like platform companies that have multiple product lines that are just giants. You look at Amazon, same thing. And, uh, I think you can forget that it took them decades, many decades to get to this. They started with one product, added another product, added, you know, a third product, uh, maybe maybe made some critical acquisitions to then compound into what you see. And and too often, I think, especially when when you're in a high-growth company, you can feel like you can fast-track your way to being that platform. And so you spin up multiple products, you hire a bunch of people because you feel like, \"Hey, I can get to that critical end state in a short window of time,\" and, you know, one-tenth, uh, essentially the time that it took these iconic companies to get there. And you wind up, you know, peanut buttering yourself and peanut buttering your resources. Uh, and then you have to kind of course correct, and it feels like now you're not going to become that platform company that you have the potential to. So I think that's fundamentally at the heart of it. I mean, I think the other part of it is, honestly, you know, it's the human piece of it. You, you when you have early employees and you've you've convinced them to join you on this crazy quest, right? You've made them an implicit promise, and now you kind of have to say, like, \"Actually, didn't really, it's not working out for you.\" Um, I think that's that's hard to do. It's hard to do. It's hard to make those changes, uh, because you do have these these commitments. So I think just the human aspect of it is also pretty important, and I think that's where, you know, having, um, that sequencing and thinking of, you know, what, \"What's my Maslow's hierarchy of needs? What's the foundational thing I need to build now to fulfill that future vision and the promise I'm making to my employees?\" Uh, and doing that over and over, consistently reviewing and sort of updating your assumptions is is really important. I think that's what folks essentially had to go through because by definition, if you made it to 2023 as as a company, uh, through the pandemic, you had incredible tailwinds, right? You just had incredible tailwinds, and those tailwinds actually turned into into headwinds, massive headwinds. And adjusting in that moment, I think, was very hard. And coming off of, you know, it's like you're driving at 100 miles an hour and then you have to hit the brakes. So, obviously, it's it's, uh, it's going to be it's going to be difficult to do. Uh, but I think if you did that correctly and and as Sean did with the Stord, I think then you're on this path of unlimited upside, right? Um, and I think that's, but that transition is is hard. I'll just throw, I think there's one or two points I think he nailed in there too, which is when you're going 100 miles an hour, the speed you hit the brakes also matters. And I think that one of my biggest learnings was in that early '22 period, we're probably making those critical decisions over a multi-month really introspective or thoughtful period and kind of worried about what may happen. And by 2023 or four when we're seeing even the most progress, we're making those decisions in days or weeks and saying, \"You just got to decide today,\" and it's the classic snow decision is a decision ultimately. But that massive action is necessary. But I gave an example of a division we shut down because we did not think it was part of our future mission or where we were headed. Uh, but I think very thoughtfully, there's also the point you may shut down things that are part of your future vision and say, \"We just got over our skis and tried to do this too soon.\" And that's almost even harder because you're saying, \"No, no, no, we're not giving up.\"\n\n\nThat, uh, total horizon of what we're going to be in time, but it's not right now, and maybe we took a step forward too soon. And having that kind of trust and conviction is also critical because it comes back to that hierarchy of needs of you can only get there if you're surviving in a great business in the first place. And I feel like so much of this is the foundation, and thankfully, we nailed the foundation, but then it's also the acceleration of, uh, at the same time, a lot of it sounds very, very downside, very let's protect, protect, protect. I think the hardest thing we did was drive this profit, drive this improvement, and all these structural advantages while also getting 10 plus times bigger over that time, and that was a hard tradeoff. So many businesses, particularly in our category, when you grow, you actually erode your economics and let's grow really fast at scale while enhancing economics. And I think that became a big proof point. In many ways, you're basically having to commit to years of conflict every day, basically. Like you're like going into conflict with everybody on your team every day to like produce a better result. That's like, that sounds horrible. I don't want to do that, you know? And in the meantime, you have this like existential doubt where everybody's looking at you to have answers. Like even last night, everyone's asking you about how to be a great CEO and all these answers, and we were walking into the hotel and you're like, \"Jan, I don't, like, we don't know. Like, do they think that I have all these like magic answers, you know? Like, we don't know, you know, nobody really knows. Like, this is a unique business.\" So you have like this intense conflict that has a long duration of time coupled with this intense doubt because the path ahead has never been seen before. That's like really gnarly.\n\nYeah, I think you saw way more people coming up to me than I did. But, uh, uh, no, I do think I get that a lot in terms of you think there's an answer once you see someone at a certain stage. And my learning, I mean, young founder, uh, a lot of investors early on said the, the number one determinant of a success and a founder like you is just pace of learning and how fast can you kind of see new patterns and adapt to them. Uh, and I think you only can actually learn fast if you also admit, like, I know nothing, and, uh, we're constantly just trying to make the best decision we can at any given time. But even comes back to that point I made on hiring big executives. You start to hire people and everyone has like a framework for this is how it was done here, and this is why it's good because you do it this way. And you start to really see through that and say, like, why is that actually good? Like, is that actually driving some sort of alpha in the result, or you start to kind of learn this question everything pattern. Don't just listen to some position of authority and kind of, uh, cut through things even, even more rapidly. But to the other point, I think my co-founder and I, Jacob, joked a lot during that same period. Uh, I don't know the full story, but there is also a story of during one of Meta Facebook's bad times a long time ago where Mark Zuckerberg would just come to work in a suit every day for a year to kind of signify this is the year we're getting serious. And no, we did not literally do that. But like I started going to the office every single day and started doing just all these kind of like, uh, I started sending a weekly Sunday email for the last three years. I have like 200 pages of a Google doc now of all these emails we've sent to the team of just that constant drumbeat of here's what's happening. Here's what we need to get done next week. And so it's like all these small symbolic items that shows your team, like, we're locked in. We're not giving up. We're pushing harder than ever. Um, and that it is time to get serious. And I think what you start to see is that people appreciate it. If you have a very high-performance culture, a very like we want to hire the best. And I think in an operational business, you kind of have naturally that operational intensity excellence kind of built into the culture. So often where you're scared about a decision of will this like disrupt my team? Will everyone leave? Will this create issues? And I've never once really seen that happen. It's much more often that it's, \"Oh, thanks for finally making that decision.\" Yeah, your team like already knows. That's the funniest bit of it. When whenever there is a fundamental change, head reduction, product direction change, anything. It's funny, like as a, as a, I think as a founder, you, you sweat about it. You're so concerned about it, and then you kind of unleash it on the team. The team is like, \"Yeah, like we thought you were going to do this like half a year ago. Like what's taking you so long?\" That's by the way, the risk of not hitting the brakes hard enough or the risk of waiting is the really good people on the, on your team, they see it. They know it. They get it. They're waiting for you to make that call. And if you don't make that call in time, you know what? They're going to lose confidence in your ability to lead and operate, and they're going to go, go elsewhere. Uh, and that's actually more often than not the failure mode of not correcting, uh, effectively. Yeah. And I thinking back through that period, I think it is overcommunication too because, uh, we also had a call right at the turn where, uh, we were talking about all the executive attrition going on across companies where people weren't believing in the value they signed up for. They felt underwater. They didn't know how to get their company to their side. Uh, unfortunately, we had to make a lot of team changes proactively. But one other proud item is we didn't lose a single, uh, leader in the company regrettably in terms of them leaving in that time. And I think that was only possible from saying, \"Here's where we're headed, and here's why it is still part of that long-term mission and going to be so valuable for you, for us.\" And you also have to build a culture where they like working on the hard things. Uh, there's a lot of negatives to the kind of like Amazon, SpaceX type cultures out there you hear about in terms of burnout, employee morale, things like that. But there's also a fraction of the population that like loves that environment and loves that intensity. And over that time, we just oscillated and rotated our culture more to that side, and we found these people, uh, love working really hard, love going so above and beyond. And I would say we're talking a lot about me in this, but the reality is like it is our team, and we just got to the best team we've ever had over that period by being so disciplined.\n\nOne of the founders yesterday was telling me about his, uh, routine to set pace within the company, which was he's in the office by 8:30 and he doesn't leave until, I think, 11. Like every day, that's like his routine right now 'cause they're in like crunch time. They're about to announce their series A. They're about to ship the product. Like it's crunch time. They're all here in New York. And he was like, \"I literally have a clock, and I like clock in and clock out.\" He's like, \"I don't necessarily need everybody to be there during that time, but like I have to kind of like the suit example. Like I have to be there just to show that like I'm here. I'm here. Like I'm not asking you to do anything that I'm not.\" You do the memos on Sundays. I'm curious, did you develop any other habits during that time?\n\nYeah, I think the, the memos on Sunday, early Sunday morning sets the pace for...\n\nWas he... Was I in the loop on those?\n\nNo, I was gonna say that's not good. I didn't get the memo.\n\nYeah. Yeah, I, I gotta send you some. They've been good. Um, I think some of it is like stories. So like in those memos or even just in Slack, we'll celebrate team members who act with the same pace and urgency. We'll talk about companies and cultures and examples of them doing that as well. Uh, but I think it's all those micro examples. Uh, I have an incredible COO, Steve Swan. Um, and he and I talk all the time about like we want to scare our team with being like omnipresent. We want like 24/7 basically to be like the first responding to something no matter how short and quick on every call, almost questioning like how are they everywhere at every, uh, given moment. Um, it's because we want the whole team to kind of see that pace and know that there's literally nothing I won't do that I'm going to ask you to do as well. I'll get on any plane, go to any customer, come to any hard meeting, whatever it is. And I think that that's not always the case. And I think that sets the right tone for the team. Even in an interview recently, I thought it was interesting. I asked the person, uh, I never asked it before, but it was for a role where I thought it was relevant. I was like, \"What's below you and what's above you beyond your capability?\" And the answer should be a lot and nothing. And unfortunately, the answer was a few things and not much. I was like, \"That's the inverse. No thanks.\" Um, because really at the end of the day, at one point I was the person taking out the trash. I was the person doing every single thing in the business, and so what has the last few years done to my ego if I'm not willing to do those things? Uh, but I think setting the pace personally is really important.\n\nDude, have you seen the internal tech memes Twitter handle? The X internal tech. Oh my gosh. The emails internal, the email. Yeah, it's like I think the handle is called internal tech emails or something. Basically through litigation.\n\nOh yeah. Like all the emails come out from Steve Jobs and like all these legendary, all the legendary CEOs. And the thing that I always look at is the response times. Like if you look at the timestamps on like Steve's emails, they're like, or Zach's emails, like when they're going back and forth on debating Snapchat. Uh, and like this is like buying Snapchat. It's like unbelievable the clock speed that they have. This is like Steve Jobs. Like, like this is like Zuck. The clock speed that they have is crazy.\n\nYeah. I remember a VC telling me early on like, \"Oh, our main partner, he's so funny. He's so busy. Every one of his emails is five words and five typos.\" And, uh, it's just so fast. And I'm like, \"Well, it sounded funny at the time. Unfortunately, that's me today.\" And the typos are almost symbolic, like I am moving very quick. But I, I think, uh, to that, there's this weird fallacy I see across people, which is like, uh, and this is not calling myself successful. The most successful and busy people have the fastest response time and are on it the most. And you'd almost assume it's the inverse, like, \"Oh, they're so busy, they'll never see this. They'll never get back to this.\" It's like, no, it's actually the opposite. You're really good at triaging and either like immediately deleting or immediately replying and just knowing that filter of like what matters. And my team laughs at me, but I'm like basically at inbox zero constantly because, uh, I'm always, always on the pulse in either a quick delete or a really rapid response. Although Ilya can hold me accountable when it comes to board sometimes, it's a little too long, too much explanation. Ilya's like, \"Give me the one sentence.\" Uh, I actually think you're pretty responsive to, actually, I think you're very responsive. Like you kind of set the clock speed internally too of like I usually know that if I have something that I text you about, it's always text. Like if you want to, good luck trying to Slack him or something, but if you want to, if you want to get a hold of it's pretty easy over text. There's also no ego, like, yeah, schedule something with my EA 4 days from now. It's like, \"Hey, can we chat?\" and we're talking on the phone within like an hour.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's, but I think it's a point you made, which is, you know, you kind of have to have a pretty good filter, otherwise you're going to get buried.\n\nYeah. Right now we're in a moment in time where everything is AI, AI, something. Okay. Companies that are far less in revenue as you, far less of a predictable business as where you are today. Like the chart that was read a few years ago is now green. It's profitable. It's growing like crazy. You know, these companies are not that predictable. They're certainly not profitable. They have relatively little revenue comparatively, and they're raising at crazy valuations, like much higher than you.\n\nDo you have a little bit of like, \"What the hell?\" Like, like is there any, is there any of that, like, where everyone around you, it's like, do you feel that envy at all? Like that idea of just like, man, all these people, it reminds me actually a little bit of like the 2021 days where there's like all these people that were raising at in crazy valuations, do you feel that?\n\nI wouldn't say envy because of what you just said, which is the 2021 days, like I've lived the raise way too high for where your revenue and size is and then lived into it, and it's not a fun period, and thankfully we've lived into it, gone beyond that valuation and more. But some of those stories, not all of them, but some of them will fall into that bucket. And that's where I think that some investors early on did advise and did push on that point of like you really never want to raise at too high of a value you don't believe you can live into because of the tension and issues it'll create for you. And so like I remember Everett at Kleiner when we were raising one of the rounds, he was giving me such thoughtful frameworks, like every hundred million of valuation you're adding in this, that means you can deliver X of free cash flow at scale. Are you ready to sign up for that? And like really helping think through. So, uh, I don't know if all those founders have experienced that same pattern over the last few years and may face it for the first time. There's also going to be many that just scale way beyond because of the promise of AI and how fast these products are getting adopted and more. We're now hitting a second interesting trend, which is I think businesses like us are becoming increasingly interesting because when you realize, okay, I can make all these vertical software applications with AI very rapidly and cheaply and scale them very rapidly, a lot of other people realize that too, and you see a lot of pricing pressure happening over the kind of multi-year period with these products that that get released and grow so fast to so much scale, and so now I think...\n\n\nThere's a lot of trends saying, \"Well, we love AI,\" but from the actual LLM layer, it is a little commoditized, where all these applications are just jumping across, whichever is the best every single day. And from this layer, there's like moat and defensibility questions in some cases, and I'm not saying it's all bad, don't take that. But now there's like a second-order question, which is, \"Well, what businesses could we actually apply AI into that either have some sort of like data or workflow moat of the customer install base or some like physical moat where you can't ever really take away that physical aspect?\"\n\nSo, whoever has the best embedded technology to apply AI to is going to win. And that's where, as that trend really takes off, I think Stord is going to be in a really advantageous position because every single order being routed, every single parcel being selected, every pick path in a warehouse, natural questions about what's going on with my order, there's so many applications of AI that don't even have to be sold to a customer. It just drives better economics to us and then really moves the needle for our customer. And we have the vertically integrated platform and the infrastructure to apply it to. So I think we're very excited about the chapters ahead because of the strong foundation we have.\n\nSo you go through this time, things were red, things were green, very green, then your chart of like business goals were red. Now we're in a moment of time where like Mojo's back, like up round. We're feeling good. Things are green to bright green again. Now what? Like what's next? I think even this, we fit the same patterns, right? Like when you hit profitable, we still have a good balance sheet. We're very much like, \"Let's build for the long term. Let's build the fortress-like balance sheet that lets us continue to execute forever,\" because I think the last few years have made me naturally very paranoid. Everything's green. We've had so many good quarters in a row. I'm just watching everything possible for, \"Let's not let anything disrupt this.\" And thankfully, there are great trends for our business. We just blew out Q1, hitting almost 3x our sales targets after four quarters prior of blowing out our sales targets. And so like we are kind of locked and leaned in.\n\nAnd I think from our perspective, we are one of the most scaled players in our industry, and we have just such dramatic scale to, when I started the business to think about, to where we are today, we powered 1% of Black Friday Cyber Monday in the U.S. We're shipping to almost 15% of unique consumers in the U.S. per year, and those are just rising rapidly, powering over $5 billion of commerce annually.\n\nThat I really do think there's so much untapped potential. This is a trillion-dollar global market where basically a deviation of GDP is our market sizing. And so, I think it's more bigger, faster, cheaper for customers, and a lot of that is hitting our kind of second, third, fourth horizon opportunities as a business. I won't say what all those are for too many competitors out there. But the biggest trend we're investing in right now is really just consumer trust and consumer visibility. And one of the most fun things I have is now as we power all these delivery promises, post-purchase tracking emails, returns portals, you're getting a Stord label on your doorstep, I get multiple texts a week of someone I haven't talked to in years just like, \"I just got a package from Stord. I just got an email from Stord.\" And it's like we want to build that Prime-like brand where someone's checking out and says, \"Oh, this is the best shipping experience I've had across any platform. I trust this brand. I'm actually going to convert at a higher rate because it's powered by Stord.\" And if we hit that layer, we again are really powering commerce. We're not just their delivery partner.\n\nAnd you're finally getting married. I just realized is the reason you delayed the engagement to the marriage for so long was cuz you needed everything in green on the business.\nIt was a long delay. Yeah. I was like, I need to make sure I have a future first. No, I'm kidding. A long delay. We were busy. We got engaged in 2023. And Steuart is just about to hit a decade old, which is hard to believe. And I started the business when I was 18, so I won't say that the first one, two years was our fastest period of development. But ultimately, it's been a really fun journey to have Mary Allen along for the ride. And we're getting married in September. Don't worry, I don't have crazy honeymoon plans just yet coinciding with peak season, but put on our calendar your PTO, please.\nYeah, just let us know. Yeah. I think I knows my PTO of the last few years has been pretty much Sean needs to take more PTO. Yeah. I had to drag him to New York at some point. I'm like, \"Hey, just bring your, bring your, I guess it was your girlfriend at the time, and like, let's just go to dinner,\" like, \"Come to New York for,\" to like, you are redlining. So anyway, we got to drag you out of that office every once in a while.\n\nThank you for doing this. Thank you. Um, are you hiring? Always, always hiring, mostly at this time in our just core business. We're growing 100 plus% a year. There's a lot of roles out across the team nationwide. I mean, we have 13 fulfillment centers. We have roles across from like industrial engineer to local on-site software engineers, corporate rise. We're probably 70, 75% Atlanta, um, so definitely that's our preference, but open after that. So stord.com, you can find our careers page and we'd love to meet. But at the same time, really, we'd love to talk to brands. I think today Stord is powering so much commerce, and we have such a flywheel where our win rate last year in deals was probably one of the things that even helped drive this round. When you actually just look at competitive head-to-head how we are in GTM, I think we booked something crazy like 25 times revenue of what we spent on sales and marketing last year. That efficiency is part of what I think is driving so much success and in in this round we just closed and more. But at the same time, my point is almost every brand we meet, we've now hit this point where we can confidently say we can deliver faster, cheaper, and with a better tech infrastructure for your customers than anyone else you've met. And that's where we're just so confident going into new deals. So if you're a brand particularly doing tens to hundreds of millions a year in GMV, we'd love to help save you money so you can redeploy that back towards winning more customers.\n\nWhen you hear the word grit, what do you think of? I think of that founder mode probably. It's like the willingness to do incredibly hard things over a long period of time without certainty that they're going to necessarily pay off because I think you have to have conviction in something and be willing to do hard things. That's what grit brings to mind for me.\nGentlemen, thank you. Thank you. That was fun. Thanks.\nThat's it for now.
