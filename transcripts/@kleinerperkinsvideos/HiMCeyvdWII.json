  "cleanText": "No one knows what kind of crazy things AI can bring to the world. Imagine down the road we really need to work for five days a week. We do this. All of us have a digital agent. When that happens, AI can help all of us make our lives 10 times, even 50 times better. We are transforming our business from a video collaboration company to be AI first system of actions. We can create a task. We can assign action items to you. We can follow. It's going to be more and more powerful. We have to keep innovating. We have to think about we are still a startup. If you lose the mindset, we are going to lose very quickly because our competitors are huge. We also, it's the number one thing for us to compete against other bigger competitors. We lose the speed, we lose everything.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome to Grit. I'm Joubin, partner at Kleiner Perkins, a show where we go beyond the highlight reel and explore the personal and professional challenges of building history-making companies. Today on the show, we have Eric Yuan, founder and CEO of Zoom. Eric basically started WebEx, then sold it to Cisco with the team in 2011, then decided he had to go redo it again his own way. The company went public in 2019 with a $9 billion valuation, then soared to $125 billion during the pandemic. The world shut down and Zoom became one of the most important pieces of technology that we've ever seen. Eric shares a ton of insights, all of the stories of what actually happened, and has a deep sense of humility that is quite rare in Silicon Valley. Enjoy the episode.\n\nThanks for doing this. Oh, my prayer. I'm so sorry. I rescheduled last time. That's okay. Sorry for that. I'm really excited. I, um, I was at, um, the Glean user conference. Yeah, I was there. Yeah. Yeah, I saw you there. And I'm sorry, did they not see you? Uh, and, um, I was talking to one of the early employees when you were about to go on stage. Yeah. And you were walking, you were walking where your head was behind us. We couldn't see your face. Yeah. And the guy that I was standing next to said, \"Man, that guy didn't know who you were.\" Said, \"That guy walks around with a lot of swagger.\" And I'm like, \"That's Eric.\" And he's like, \"Eric, who?\" And I'm like, \"That's the guy that owns 20% of a $30 billion company.\" Like, that's that's why you walk around with swagger. Anyway, you did a great job. Thank you. Appreciate. Thank you. Yeah, you did a great job.\n\nWhy'd you do that? Because, uh, you know, two reasons. One reason, you know, is a friend, you know, a lot of people support me along the way, you know, he built such a great company. He asked them to join, you know, him on his first year conference, you know, more like a, you know, a lot of people support me. It's more like a give back as well. He's a friend and also the startup community, you know, on a personal front, I will support him, on a business front, they are our partner as well, and our AI companioning, we do integrated with Glean, you know, data index layer, you know, I think, yeah, business front, personal front, I think, why not, even if I don't want to go to San Francisco, you know, a one-hour drive, right? So, but, you know, this is a part of a giving back to some extent.\n\nDo you feel a responsibility these days to maybe give what you take, what you took from the early days? I think so, because I live in Silicon Valley. This is the culture of Silicon Valley, you know. I moved here in 1997. A lot of people helped me, even if I do not know him, know them, right? But sometimes when you achieve a little things, you have more time, bies, resources, why not pipe others. So, you know, I think this is the one of the key reasons why Silicon Valley is so successful. So, when did, when did you move from China? 1997. 97. Did you fly straight to Silicon Valley? Yes. 1997 August as an engineer. As an engineer. And did you have any idea what it was going to be like? Like, is what you dreamed of in China of Silicon Valley, what you think of what it was when you got here? I think of even better than I thought, because when I was a kid, I was always fascinated by the stories, uh, you know, those amazing, you know, world-changing, you know, stories like Apple, HP, and also I remember, you know, the Netscape, you know, Yahoo, as crazy internet stories, and when I came here, I realized, wow, it's sort of a dream coming true, because, you know, 1997, 1998, as the first wave of internet revolution, there were so many startup companies. Yeah. Almost every day everyone was talking about that. So, I was extremely excited. I still remember that exciting moment. So, do you feel that excited still? Yes, absolutely. I think along the way, because, you know, very busy, you know, I joined WebEx, later on, the company sold to Cisco. I was hesitant to so many things, and even, you know, after the internet wave of revolution, you see the mobile, but now I feel like the AI era, even more exciting than 1997, you think so? Yes, absolutely. You're more excited about what could be now than you were back in the days when the internet was just being formed. Absolutely. This time, AI, I can, I can tell you, no one knows what kind of crazy things AI can bring to the world, you know. Imagine down the road, let's say we have very mature AI technology, do we really need to work for five days a week, maybe three days, maybe two days, you know, all of us have a digital agent or even a digital twin. And when that happens, you, you think about that, you know, AI can help all of us make our lives 10 times, even 50 times better. This never happened in the internet era or PC era or mobile era.\n\nDoes that sound like, culturally, do you think we'll even be able to absorb the idea? I don't think mentally we're ready yet. That's what I mean. Like, even hearing you say people that are in the industry like you and I that are living and breathing in this technology every day are like, \"Oh my god, this is insane.\" Totally. Like, we see it every day and we're like, \"This is insane.\" And even for us, let alone everybody else in the world, I think it's hard. Tell me if you agree. I totally agree.\n\nLet's say sometimes when I wake up in the morning, when I think about the exciting things AI can, you know, bring to the world, I'm so excited, but sometimes I'm extremely concerned as well, you know, like what's happening today, let's say the computer science graduates used to be can easily find a job, right? So many companies want to hire those, uh, you know, CS, uh, graduates, but today. Look at the old CS graduates, right? It's not that easy to find a job anymore. That's crazy. Exactly. That's Yeah. How old are your kids? Do you have kids? I have three kids. How old are they? Yeah, it's, uh, you know, 24, 21, 19. 19. So, okay. 21, 19, they're in college or one's going to college, one's in college. Yeah. College. When they ask you like, \"Dad, what do we do after college?\" What do you tell them? I do not have a great answer. What, what I told them is laser focus on what you are doing every day. Make sure and execute very well, no matter who tell you, you know, like, give a task, right? Maybe your, your, your, you know, you register some class, try to get a good grade and enjoy a pus life at the same time, learn a little bit AI, that's pretty much, you know, mentally get yourself ready gradually. You do not want to tell them, \"Hey, tomorrow most of jobs will be replaced, they will be augmented.\" I do not think that will happen, you know, for the time being, eventually, maybe 10 years, 20 years, you, I think they are learning. I, you know, we, I do not want to kind of for share what might happen, you know, on the positive front or negative front of AI technology, you know, why, you know, kids already have a lot of other things, why you want to bringing more anxiety to them.\n\nIs it weird? At some point, Zoom was, you know, the hottest company in the planet, and everybody wanted to come work there. And now people at Zoom are probably thinking about going to these AI labs and going to these other. Is it weird? Like, now all of a sudden, everyone wants to go to the new cool shiny thing, and you're like, \"Wait, I thought what we were doing was pretty good.\" That's, that's always great. This is the reason why sitting is so successful, right? Because something very hard, the new technology, new startup, very smart talents, they all want to join those great promising startup companies. Nothing wrong about that. But at the same time, we also need to embrace new technology as well. You know, of course, we have a lot of employees who are already working here for a long time. You know, we have a big AI team in Seattle and also have core engineers here, you know, in the San Jose area. I think we have a lots of AI innovations, right? So, it's always great. We never technology for sure. You will see a lot of great startups. At the same time, those other, you know, companies also try to catch up as well. I, I think ultimately any new technology will benefit everyone, not only for startups, but also for established companies as well.\n\nYou were one of the first engineers at WebEx. I was one of the first 10 engineers. 10 engineers. And you spent what, nine years there? Uh, 10 years. 10 years. And then the company was sold to Cisco. Cisco for a few billion dollars. 3.2 or 3.4, I forgot. And you left as you became, you were the VP of engineering when the acquisition happened. Right. Correct. And you spent a few years at Cisco. Four years. Yes. Four years. And you basically were Cisco bought WebEx, which was the predecessor to Zoom in many ways. It was, um, the early telecommunications, and you were trying to basically build a new version of WebEx. Yeah. Inside of Cisco, and you couldn't get it done. Yeah. Right. So then you spun out and started Zoom. Correct. Is that right? I don't want to rewrite. That's right. That's right. Okay. What about now when, and the reason you spun out of Cisco was because it was a big company that couldn't get off of its butt. There was too much antibodies to change and they had just bought this new thing. Why would they go build another new thing that they just bought this thing? Invest in the thing that they just bought. And so obviously you had to go start your own company because it wasn't going to happen at Cisco. It's like the classic innovator's dilemma. Yes, absolutely.\n\nWhat about now? Like, do you feel like, geez, are there people at Zoom today that are, that are Eric 20 years ago that are trying to build an AI stack of video communication? Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. For every, I will say the established companies, right? You always face that dilemma on the one hand, right? You want to engineers work hard, come up with some ideas, contribute to growth, on the other hand, you know, because, you know, your core business, right? Because the processes, right? Sometimes slow, you know, velocity not there, how to balance that, right? It's hard. It's not that straightforward, you know. I fully understand, you know, why, you know, I was at Cisco, you know, I wanted to rebuild everything is very, very hard, and nothing wrong about that, because a lot of other priorities, right? That's the reason why, you know, how to make sure you have a culture when engineers, you know, and some individual contributors, right? They come up with some ideas, don't always say no, no, no, you know, you, you should, you know, focus on something else, always think about the balance, you know, the existing priority and also the future new ideas, right? But even you try very hard, even have a great culture to embrace new ideas, sometimes may not work, and there some employee, they still want to leave to start a new company. I think we, that's okay, that's you look at the entire ecosystem, that's always good, you know, you got to contribute to contribute back to the ecosystem, right?\n\nSo this is going to be a weird question, so take it with what you will. I just thought of it now. If you're this excited, okay, about what the future is, and you still seem to me like you could work for a lot longer, and you want to go work on something different that's not Zoom. Yeah. Can you do that? Like, this is a huge public company. You're the founder and CEO. Like, you are beloved at this company. Your ratings of as a CEO are higher than any I've ever seen at any other tech company ever. Like, can you go and do something else? Do you ever feel stuck? Yes and no. Because on the one hand, you know, this is more like my baby, right? And a lot of employees are working so hard behind this, trying to make a company better and better every day. I feel like we have a huge, you know, responsibility to leverage Zoom technology to help the world, to deliver happiness to our customers, partners, investors. On the other hand, I feel like, let's see, if I'm not the CEO of Zoom, what should I do? I think, given the AI, the biotech, I have a lot of new ideas, but sometimes I need to tell myself, I focus, you know, and even if new ideas, you cannot do that, that's the reason why sometimes also invest into startups as well and to help others, you know, to achieve their dreams, because for all of us, we all have, you know, all kinds of, you know, dreams, but sometimes you have to laser focus on one or two, even if every day I think about, \"Wow, what if I do this, do that?\" Then you realize, you know, you are the founder and the CEO of one company, right? You got to focus. So, um, we've seen some other CEOs of your magnitude doing some other things, right? Like, let's take, uh, Brian Armstrong at Coinbase, he's amazing guy. Yeah, my friend. Yeah. Um, I've actually, I've had Emilie, his COO, on, but I've never had Brian on, and I, he's high on my list. He's, I think, very highly of him, and he started a company that we're actually investors in called New Limit, which is a longevity company. He's still the full-time CEO of Coinbase. And you know, now he's doing, he's not the CEO of New Limit, but he's pretty involved. So maybe there is a way to, obviously, there's Elon's and some, there's some, maybe there is a way to have, has way more energy than I have. So, I'm, I'm, I'm already 55, you know. I think even focus on when I feel like, you know, I need a more time, more benefits, right? So, I really do not think I can do, you know, other things. So, do you think, um, it's possible for others? For sure, yeah, you, but you feel a responsibility to just focus on Zoom? Yes, I do. I do not only responsibility, but also, you know, my philosopher always focus on one thing, because even focus on one thing, we are facing all kinds of challenges, right? So, I, even I personally\n\n\nI do not have a\nbenefits, you know, to think about, you\nknow, other new things. I mean, you know, I\nmean, let's say another startup outside\nof Zoom. Unfortunately, you know, I do not\nhave that. Do you have bandwidth to think\nabout other things outside of, like, if\nit's Zoom is takes up a lot of bandwidth?\nWhat else do you have bandwidth for? I do\nnot have a lot of hobbies at all. A\nfamily and Zoom, that's pretty much\nthat's it. Very simple. Those are the two\nthings that you focus on. What about\nlike friends? Friends for sure. Friends,\nyou know, it's I I always spend time,\nyou know, over the weekend on Sunday\nmornings, you know, some friends and I\nwe went to Windy Hill for hiking. Yeah.\nAnd some, you know, friends gathered\ntogether, you know, exchange some ideas,\nlearn from each other, and share what's\ngoing on in the in the, you know, tech\nworld. This is always, you know, I I think\nthis is good for me and good for the\ncompany as well because all of us got to\ndo figure out a way how to learn. I\nbecome a better leader, right? When you\nwhen you kind of get together with your\nfriends, you can learn a lot, learn from\nothers. But do you think like, uh, that\ndefinition of friends, those are other\nCEOs now, they have become your friends,\nbut in your mind, do you maybe\ncompartmentamentalize that as work, right?\nCuz you're learning ultimately that you\ncan reapply that stuff to your job. Does\nthat make sense? Yeah, it does. I do not\nthink that's work. This is part of life,\nyou know, essentially what I'm doing\nevery day. I feel like is a life or\nwork. I see no difference. Yeah. Right.\nBecause you hang out with a great other\nleaders, you learn a lot from them and\non business front is good for for for me,\nfor my company, and also the part of\nfriendship as well, right? Because you\nknow, some, you know, you, they also can\nlearn from you as well, exchange some\nideas, maybe some investment opportunity\nto have a a startup. I I think it's I\nenjoy that.\nWhat comes first? Family or friends?\nFamily first. I think that's an obvious\nanswer and I think everybody would say\nthat. That's our Zoom's philosophy on\nday one, you know, cuz you know,\neveryone try to talk about the balance\nwork and life. I I tell our team, guys,\nyou know, as there's no way to balance,\nyou know, work is life, life is work.\nHowever, whenever there's a conflict,\nguess what? Family first. That's it. Can\nyou give me examples of personal\nconflicts that you've had that most\npeople would struggle with? I just many\nyears ago, I remember my son doing high\nschool and they they had a basketball\ngame in San Francisco. It happened to be\nalso we have a new year, you know,\nChristmas party. The whole company, they\nflew from other cities to to San Jose\nand the the the Christmas party in San\nJose and my son's basketball game in San\nFrancisco. I told our team I cannot make\nit on time. I need to finish watching my\nson's basketball game first and then I\ngo to the to our company's Christmas\nparty. They all, they all understood why\nI'm doing that because I told her the\nteam I got to do leader by example,\nfamily first. Even today, whenever there's\nconflict, family first. I have heard\nstories about you, Eric, tell me if this\nis true, like, uh, when your kids were in\nmiddle school and high school, of the 25\nparents, you were the most involved in\ntheir sports teams and activities, not\nonly at the games, but the practices, you\nwould go to the practices.\nIs that true? It's true. I should have\ninvolved involved more. Now kids already\ngrown up. Looking back, I ask them, ask\nmyself, do I regret anything? That's\nonly one thing. Looking back, I should\nhave even spent more time with the kids,\nwith the boys, with the girl, you know,\nyou know, when I back to home, I should\nhave put myself in a in a different\nroom, right? So, because you know, it's\nthat's something is a part of your life,\nright? Because when the kids grown up,\nyou really want to spend more time. They\nhave their own, you know, activities.\nIt's not that easy anymore. You're\nsaying you have a narrow window of time\nfrom absolutely 1 to 15 years old before\nthey become Yeah. When Okay, let me ask\nyou like tactical questions around this\ncuz I'm curious. When other parents\nwould see you there, were that surprise\nthem? I do not think so because every\ntime they saw me there. So, right.\nThat's fair. Yeah. First time they might\noh, I thought you are busy, right? I think\nno, I'm not busy, like, this is more\nimportant. But are you on your phone the\nentire time? No. When let's\nsay you take a basketball game for\nexample, when my son, he did not play,\nfor sure I on the phone or maybe my\ndaughter, right? When she not on her\ndance class, you know, I I might be, you\nknow, also send my, you know, the middle\nsong, you know, you know, sometimes to\nYMCA and also some practice as well. And\nwhen he's practiced something, I always,\nyou know, enjoy that as well. And uh,\nyeah, so you'll bring your laptop when\nyour son's out or your daughter's out,\nyou open the laptop, start doing emails.\nThat's the reason why I\nhave a backup problem today cuz I was\nsitting there for way too long and then\nand then when they get back in the game,\nyou close your laptop, you watch them. Yes,\nthat's exactly what I did. That's what\nyou do. So you bring your laptop. Yeah,\nsometime laptop, sometimes just myself,\njust your this one. Yeah. And as soon as\nyou hear that they're checking in. Yeah.\nyou're just a strange context for the\ngame.\nThat's amazing. Do you have any rituals\nat home about like, uh, dinners or\nbreakfasts, things that you do with your\nfamily? It's when the kids when they\nwere young, yeah, we always g together.\nLater on, they have a different\nactivities, you know, the schedule is\ndifferent. It's very hard, right? Kind\nof, hey, let's gather together, maybe, uh,\nyou know, 7:00 in the morning, talk about\nwhat's happening. It's it got harder and\nharder. Many kids in the high school. How\nhow is your travel schedule like? Do you\ndo you like, uh, it's very straightforward.\nSo before I became empty neester, I told\nmy team I don't want to have any\nbusiness travels, that's it. I just always,\nyou know, because I can use Zoom, giving\nme a great excuse, right? You know,\nsince last September, I became empty\nneester. Guess what? This year already\nhave a five or six, you know, business\ntrips already. Way more than what I did\nover the past few years. A sum total of\nall the years before. You did no\nbusiness travel. Yeah. My target is zero\nbusiness travel before I became an empty\nneester. Yeah. By the way, I can tell, I\nI share with you an example in 2019\nbefore the company went public. Suppose\nfor every company to become a, you know,\npublic, you got to join the IP road show,\nright? You to travel to New York or\nBoston area, sometime you need to travel\nto Europe. And our board very supportive.\nI told our board I don't want to travel\nat all. Our CFO, she did travel to, you\nknow, other cities, meet other investors.\nI told my CFO and also a board, I will only\njoin over Zoom. Initially, they think\nThat's not a good idea. But later on\nthey were supportive. It turned out it\nworked so well. In particular for those\ninvestors, they never heard about Zoom.\nThey never use Zoom. Guess what? After\nthe investor meeting, they also unders\nunderstood and know what are doing. They\ngot a first-hand experience. This is great\nnot only for them, but also for me as\nwell.\nI can spend more time with family. Is\nthat why you don't want to travel? Just\nto spend more time with family? Correct.\nThat's the only reason. No. Any other\nreasons? And specifically when you say\nfamily, you say you mean kids. Yeah.\nKids. My wife too. Yeah. But you break\nthe rules a little bit now. That's no\nkids. You travel a little bit more.\nBecause kids already grown up, right? So\nthen the cameras all mean they already\nwork. So yeah. Did you ever have to\ntravel during those times? Like there\nwas never a deal that was like,\n\"Eric, we can sign this $10 million deal\nwith this huge customer, but they want\nto come and they they want you to come\nshake their hand. Look at look at look\nat them in the eyes.\" That never\nhappened. Actually, here's my my trick.\nI told them, I told a team, I told those\ncustomers, let's have a Zoom call\nfirst and try to, you know, and sign a\ndeal after this. If you still want me to\ntravel there in person, I will. I'm not,\nsince no, it's not good, right? To say no, I\nwill say, let's do a Zoom call first.\nGuess what? After Zoom call, all of them\ntold me that, Eric, it's okay now, you do\nnot need to come\nhere. That's my\ntrick. It worked\nevery time it worked.\nThat was when the IPO road show was\nhappening. It was right before COVID,\nright? Correct. 2019 April. So because a year\nlater everybody was doing their road\nshows over Zoom. Exactly. Exactly. So\nessentially, you know, we we we did help,\nyou know, all other, you know, startups,\nyou know, after, you know, after that,\nright? You know, to leverage Zoom, you\nknow, for their IP road show.\nHow insane was that time?\nWhen COVID happened\nand how much did usage go up in four\nweeks?\nSo a given number by the end of, uh, 2019,\nwe have a daily meeting\nparticipants and on a pig days, uh, around\n10 millions, 10 million meetings per day\non Zoom on a pig day. Yep. By March,\nApril time frame,\nis it jumped all the way to more than\n350\nmillion. 35 times\nmore with just Yeah. in March, April\ntime frame. 35 times more. Yeah. I mean,\nthe entire world was dependent on your\ntechnology, right? Yeah. For a while.\nYeah. For like 6 months. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. A little bit more than that, I\nguess. From the outside looking in,\nthat's every CEO's dream, right? All of\na sudden, 35 times your stock goes\ncrazy, right? All of a sudden, the\ncompany's worth $125\nbillion. Do you own 20% of that company?\n35x. I mean, but did it did it feel like\na dream when it was happening? I don't\nthink so because internally you do not\nknow how hard it was and on what was\nhard on personal front. I had a way more\nsleep nights than any time in my career.\nOur team worked extremely hard around\nthe clock. The reason why, you know,\nsuddenly, you know, we have a traffic,\nyou know, we need a more servers and in\nEurope and let's say in India, in other\ncountries, right? So, and we got to work\nso hard, you know, make sure actually\nthere's no any, you know, potential the\nthe the, you know, traffic, you know, the\nissues and make sure the service always\nup because this is the best time for us to\nleverage our technology to make it to\ncontribute back to the world, you know,\nwe do not want to our users down. That's\nright reason why, luckily, you know, we\nhave invested company culture, no one\ncomplain. We all work so hard for such a\nlong time, a long time. And quite often,\nI did not sleep the whole night, work\ntogether with the team, hey, maybe at a\ntraffic there, maybe quickly do something\nfrom all side perspective. The service\nwas so stable and works so well. But\ninternally, wow, this is crazy time for\nfor a while. When you're having those\nsleepless\nnights, are you literally trying to\nsleep and laying in bed thinking or are\nyou just at this point on Zoom with\nEurope with I couldn't sleep at all\nbecause so many things I need to focus\non. You really cannot delegate so many\nthings to others because it's extremely\ncritical, important, like what in, you\nknow, like you see suddenly, you know, we\nhave, you know, uh, we need to add like\n500 server, maybe 5,000 server, what can\nwe do to make sure when you add so many\nservers overnight, you nothing will be\nbroken, right? That's one, you know, at\nsame time, remember back then, you know,\nbecause, uh, you know, lot of, you know,\nsort of looking back, some articles, you\nknow, about the Zoom in practice, you,\nbecause we give the in, you know, the the\nfree licenses, you know, to, you know, uh,\na lot of K to 12 schools around 25\ncountries, you know, at that time, we\ndid not realize even if you build all\nkinds of security features, normally\nwhen you work together with IT team, they\nwill enable those security features and\nby themsel when you give the free\nlicenses to K to 12 schools, quite often\nsome K to 12 schools, they did not have\nIT team and we realized that if they did\nnot on the the password and no waiting\nroom, guess what? When a kid share the\nthe Zoom link, you know, to the social\nmedia, other people might easily join or\nhack into the classroom. When we realize\nthat, okay, what can we do quickly, you\nknow, we become it team, you know, a lot\nof thing like that, right? So, you know,\nneed my personal involvement, right? To\nmake sure, you know, drive that, make\nsure happen today, don't wait tomorrow,\nyou know, every day something new like\nthat, you know, that's reason I I was, uh,\nso, you know, and busy at that time. So\nyou literally didn't sleep or you like\nkind of didn't sleep? Sometimes, you know,\nseriously, sometimes the whole night I\ndid not sleep it at all. So you're\nworking. Yeah,\nabsolutely, not only myself, sometimes\nengineers as well. You're just pulling\nall nighters like you're in college.\nExactly. I just wish I was younger that\ntime. I can't have two nights I I did\nnot sleep, but some in one night I did\nnot sleep. The following day I I did\nfeel, Oh my god. You feel tired, right?\nYeah. You're making a cup of coffee at\nlike four in the morning. Yeah.\nAnd was it added pressure because\neverybody was counting on you for a\nwhile? For sure. In particular, you look\nat the the the K to 12 schools and and you\nknow, lot a lot of use cases, right? And\nyou feel like, you know, like a wedding\nceremony, you feel like, wow, you know,\ndream coming true, right? If you can\nhave a wedding ceremony on Zoom, you\nknow, being the CEO of a com of a Zoom,\nI realize we need to do all we can, make\nsure service always up, always reliable.\nThey make sure those use cases work so\nwell. This is once in a live\nopportunity. You do not want to come and\nsay I'm going to have a wedding ceremony\non Zoom. Guess what? If it did not work,\nthat'd be a horrible experience. That's\nthe reason why we feel the huge\nresponsibility to contribute to the\nworld, to help the world. At some point\nduring that time, did you ask yourself\nlike, I didn't sign up for this, like, this\nis like, I thought I was supposed to make\npeople work more effectively. I didn't\nsign up for the weddings and you know, I\nnever had that question. I always\nthought about, wow, this is great\nopportunity, you know, of course, this\nour company, the culture, deliver\nhappiness, you know, company values is\ncare, you know, care about the community,\ncustomer, company, teammates as well as\nourselves. If you truly care about\ncommunity, care about the society, this\nis the time you got you have to do all\nyou can to help the\nworld. When the stock went\ncrazy, I mean it\nCrazy. This Zoom was worth $130 billion.\nAt that time, I was really not happy at\nall. And you were miserable. Miserable.\nI knew actually some of them\n\n\nMight, you know, might cash out, right?\nSo, very young, they cash out, you know.\nNothing wrong about that, you know, but\nit's not good for them, not good for us\neither because some of them made, you\nknow, a lot of money in a very short\nperiod of time, so quickly made a lot of\nmoney.\nThat's not good.\nIt's really not good.\nYou're saying employees.\nYeah, exactly.\nWhy not?\nWhy is not good?\nBecause they are very young.\nYou know, you got to learn more things\nand suddenly made a lot of money, they\nrealize, oh, what should I do?\nThey take a break.\nThey, they know, they essentially they\nlost.\nThey completely get lost.\nIt's not good for those very young\npeople if you make a lot of money within\na very short period of time.\nI do not think that's healthy.\nIt's not sustainable because the stock\n67xed in like a few months.\nYeah.\nYeah, exactly.\nYeah, more than that actually, you know,\nprior to COVID, probably around $70,\nsomething like that.\nYou know, all the way to 500, more than\n500.\nThat's crazy.\nDid you know that it was not going to\nlast?\nUh, at that time, I did not think about\nthat.\nI think about this price, for sure, it's\nkind of not sustainable.\nYeah, right.\nWhat should we do?\nAnd uh, so you, you cannot control the\nstock price, right?\nWhat can you do?\nYou know, what do you do?\nI just tell, you know, where there, I\nthink, hey guys, we got to look at the\nfuture.\nYeah.\nAnd how sustainable it is.\nI do not think that's sustainable.\nWe have to innovate, you know, we have to,\nyou know, keep, you know, uh, improving\nour company culture, and that's pretty\nmuch, otherwise, you know, sooner or\nlater, you are going to hit the wall.\nSo, and were you selling at that time?\nI, for sure, I did sell because my sale\nis kind of even prior to COVID, it's\nannual price, right?\nIt's already defined.\nYeah.\nYeah, exactly.\nAlready defined.\nSo, yeah.\nYeah.\nAnd it's crazy to own 20% of the company\nat IPO is a lot.\nThat's, it's just, it's just that's, you\ndon't see that very often.\nUh, actually, you know, I'm the soul\nfounder, right?\nSo, I view my early, you know, uh, uh,\nuh, employees and my angel investors,\nyou know, all of the my co-founders.\nYou know, when I started the company, the\nvaluation is a 15 million.\n15.\nYeah, 15.\nAnd I gave a lot of shares to all those\nearly Android investors.\nA lot.\nWhen you started the company, was there\nnot people telling you that you should\nhave a co-founder and that the weight of\nthis company is going to be too heavy\nfor just you?\nDuring the COVID times, did you wish that\nmaybe you actually had a co-founder?\nI don't know.\nI never thought about that.\nI think, you know, I, when I started a\ncompany, I was already 41 years old.\nI think I can handle the, you know, the\npressure.\nI, because the velocity is everything.\nI feel like it's better for me just, you\nfor sure there's pros and cons, right?\nYou have a co-founder, right?\nBut in my case, I feel like I, I, I, I\ncan handle the pressure and also I want\nto make a faster decision.\nI never, you know, regretted and having\nanother co-founder.\nYou spent your entire career doing this\ntype of work, like you chose Webex.\nSo, how did you end up, like, how did\nyou decide on that use case?\nSo, in a year before I left Cisco, you\nknow, I spent a lot of time, you know,\ntalking with uh, customers, you know,\nthey all complained about mobile\nexperience, and we wanted to add video,\nbut the video experience was not great,\nand also the innovation speed is not as\ngood as customer expected.\nI realized that, you know, you know, the\nWebex, Webex, you look at at its core,\nthat's a data collaboration architecture.\nIf you really want to build the best,\nyou know, video uh, experience, you have\nto rewrite everything from the ground up\nbecause at that time, you know, Cisco\nstill, they still can sell a lot of\nWebex, you know, you suddenly you see I\nwant to build a new solution from the\nground up, you know, essentially, they,\nyou know, they do not want to cannibalize\nthe existing business.\nThere's no way for them to say, yeah,\nlet's stop the, the investing into the\ncurrent product, build a new one, it's\nhard.\nSo, finally, you know, customer, they\nwere not happy, and it's feel like Webex\nis my baby, you know, when customer, they\ndid not feel happy, you know, when they\nare using Zoom as a Webex, I was not\nhappy either.\nSo, every morning, I did not want to go\nto office.\nI struggled for one year.\nI feel like it's time for me to leave.\nI got to build a new solution to bring\nhappiness back to those Webex customers.\nThat's how I started.\nAnd when you were starting the company,\ndid you, at 41 years old, is not, you\nknow, not young to start a company\nrelative to, I wish I was young at that,\nlike Brian, you know, or some of the\nother folks.\nThat's the reason why they can do so many\nother things as well.\nSo, did you feel like maybe your, the way\nthat you thought about your kids and\nraising your kids had something to do\nwith the age that you started the\ncompany?\nMeaning a lot of founders now are\nstarting companies well before kids.\nThey're finding product market fit the\nfirst few years.\nLike, did you feel like maybe this was\nyour way of avoiding the guilt of\nstarting a company late knowing that you\nhad kids?\nThat's one of the reasons you're so\nright.\nAgain, every company is different.\nEvery founder, you know, story is\ndifferent.\nIn my case, you're so right.\nThat's one of the reasons I want to make\nsure the kids grown up a little bit.\nAnd because my wife also very busy,\nright?\nThree kids, you know, I feel like, huh,\nmaybe when they are already in school,\nmaybe, you know, admin school, maybe it's\ntime to, to start.\nAlso, the timing perfect.\nOn the one hand, I was not happy, on the\nother hand, you know, kids in the middle\nschool and admin school already, I feel\nlike it's right time.\nIf I did not start a company at that\ntime, if I start a company today, guess\nwhat, my energy level, for sure, is way\ndown, you know, compared to 10 or 20\nyears ago.\nYeah.\nWhen you were having unhappy days.\nA year of unhappy days is a lot of\nunhappy days.\nWhy did you even stick around for a year\nto start Zoom?\nNo, to at Webex before you started Zoom.\nYeah, because, you know, I was at Cisco.\nI was one of the first several founding\nengineers.\nSo, I, I did write a lot of code for\nWebex as well.\nYou put a huge amount of, you know, work\nand it's into Webex product.\nIt's very emotional.\nI was thinking about leaving a few times.\nEvery time I told myself, ah, there's so\nmany things not done yet, you know, still\nsome commitment either to Webex or to\ncustomer.\nI, I, I told almost everyone, I, I told\nthem also, you know, after Webex got\nacquired by Cisco, I wanted to grow\nWebex revenue to a billion dollar\nrevenue, I'm going to leave, try to\nbuild something new.\nI told the team, but, you know, when the\nday when I left, the revenue still less\nthan $1 billion, around 800 or 850,\nsomething like that.\nI cannot wait.\nI did think about leaving a few times.\nSo, but you told yourself a billion and\nyou couldn't even wait till then.\nYeah.\nAnd how long did you wait until you\nstarted Zoom?\nProbably one and a half years or two\nyears.\nThat long.\nYeah.\nWhat did you do during that time?\nI struggled because I want to fix the\nproblem, make it better, and I want to\nbuild something totally different.\nI want to focus on to build a consumer\nproduct, very different, you know, the\nmarket, and uh, on the one hand, you\nknow, I, I thought about, hey, I need to\nbuild something new, on the other hand, I\nneed to make sure because I was the vice\npresident of engineering, right?\nAnd I need to make sure Web product\nbetter and better, still a lot of\nresponsibility, you know, and I\nstruggled for almost two years.\nUh, you were, were you weren't working?\nI, I was, I was working.\nOkay, working so hard at that time also.\nOkay.\nBut, but when you quit Cisco, how long\nbefore you started Zoom?\nOne weekend.\nI left Friday.\nI started Monday morning.\nNo way.\nYeah, that's exactly Friday.\nI left at Friday or Thursday.\nI forgot, you know.\nBut Monday morning, I started working for\nmy new company.\nYou incorporated everything Monday at that\ntime in the process incorporating the\ncompany and try to call FR to to buy.\nI, I use the furniture and write down\nthe comedy culture and the value as well\nand to to start just myself.\nSo, you one of the first things that you\ndid was writing down the culture and the\nvalues.\nThe second thing, I'm sorry, the first\nthing I just I remember called a friend,\nI, I needed some used the furniture\nafter that, and uh, I think I started\nwriting company the the the my goal and\nthe culture and value, so on so forth.\nAnd then were you writing the first lines\nof code?\nNo, I, I, I didn't, you know, and uh, if\nI, if I did that, you know, who is going\nto be a product manager, UI designer,\nanything else, you know, when I started,\nall others are engineers, I'm responsible\nfor everything else, and for I, for, for,\nfor pay the bill, for the utility bill or\nphone bill, I, I did it by myself.\nI paid the insurance for all the\nemployees as well, and anything else I,\nyou know, I handled.\nSo, except for writing code.\nWas it, I mean, was it pretty awkward\nbetween you and Cisco at that point?\nIt, it was not awkward, cuz, you know,\nafter left, for sure, a lot of people\nwanted to join.\nYeah, only I cannot afford to hire so\nmany people, you know, only, you know,\nmaybe a little bit over 20 to start with,\nthey joined me, and uh, that's pretty\nmuch, cuz, you know, this is Sink Valley,\nwe want to build the next generation, so\nwe, we write everything from a ground up,\nthis is very clean, so it's a next\ngeneration technology.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nHow long before you had 20 people in the\ncompany?\nUh, for the few weeks, within a few weeks\nyou had 20 people working?\nYeah, yeah, I think less, less than,\nless than two months.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nDid you know before you even started\nbuilding it that you could actually build\nthis technology, that the time was right?\nI know for sure I can build a better\ntechnology, that part for sure, cuz I\nwas, you know, VP engineer, I, I was\nvery hands-on.\nI still, even today, I still understand\nthe code.\nSo, yeah, I knew I can build a better\ntechnology.\nThat's part for sure.\nWhat didn't you know?\nI did not know is uh, how to, you know,\nuh, build a product, you can make a\nconsumer happy and also make enterprise\nhappy, because I struggled, should I\nstart from consumer, SMB, should I just,\nshould I start selling to the enterprise?\nI, I did struggle a little bit about\nthat, but later on realized, let's focus\non, you know, the enterprise customers,\nyou should not, you know, focus on\nconsumers.\nWhy?\nWhat, what tipped you off towards one\ndirection or another?\nBecause, you know, the consumer, uh, uh,\nif you build a consumer product and\nversus the enterprise product, the go to\nmarket is very different, the way to\nmonetize is very different, the\nconsumers, you cannot charge them, you\nknow, a lot, right?\nSo, enterprise is different, you know,\nfeature request also is different, you\nknow, the, the, you know, let's say, take\nsome financial institutions, you know,\ncompliance is very important, right?\nYou need to make sure you, you, you have\nvery secure, you know, architecture, you\nknow, make sure you, you, you with all\nthose features, they even do not want to\nlook at your solution.\nFor consumers, you need to make sure the\nusability and a lot of cool features,\nright?\nYou know, you should make sure start from\nthat first, right?\nIt's very different, the feature, feature\nsets.\nBut was there demand from enterprises\nearly that signaled that you should go\nthere, or was it just it's going to be\ntoo difficult and overwhelming to do the\nconsumer stuff?\nI think to start with, both very\ndifficult, right?\nYou know, consumer, enterprise, you know,\nwe focus on those kind of a medium,\nmedium size companies, like 100 to two,\nyou know, to 500, you know, like some\nstartup companies, they really wanted to\nbuild, uh, they want really wanted to\ndeploy a frictionless, you know, the\nvideo conferencing experience, you know,\nlike our, I remember our product was not\nready at that time, you know, Stanford\ncontinue studies group, they tried to, to,\nto, to kind of test a, a solution,\nsolution can help their online, you know,\nthe teaching online learning, they tested\nalmost every other product, none of them\nworked so well, and finally they found\nZoom, wow, the video experience amazing,\neven before our product was ready, they\nwanted to buy, that's how we started, and\nthen the second one also the university\nas well.\nSo, we started model from a high ed, you\nknow, one by one, one by one, and that's\nthat's how we, you know, uh, uh, uh, grew\nour business at that time.\nH, I guess, is it weird that the stock\nprice is basically the same as, was it\nwhat it was before COVID, and you're, I\ndon't know what your users are probably\nway up, your the company's a lot in a lot\nbetter position than it was before COVID,\nbut the stock price is the same.\nSo, if you remember right, the April when\nthe company went in public, right?\nI think the first day stock closed like a\n66, something like that.\nI was on the, the, I think maybe CNBC\ninterview, I, I at that time, I, I told\neveryone the stock price was over, stock\nwas overpriced.\nYou went on CNBC, overvalued, because at\nthat time, because again, I really do not\nwant to focus on stock price, you know,\nsome undervalued, over value, what can\nyou do?\nJust focus on your product, your\nbusiness, your culture, your customers,\nyou know, stock price, you know, will be\ntaken care of by itself.\nIf you focus on stock price, you know,\nit's really hard.\nSo, I, that's not my focus at all.\nSo, so it went out.\nSo, you don't even think about that now.\nI did not think about it for a long time,\neven, even from very beginning.\nBut it is weird, isn't it, that the\nbusiness is in such better shape and the\nstock is the same as what it was before\nCOVID?\nYeah.\nYou know, at that time, the growth rate\nmuch higher, you know, during COVID, the\n300% year-over-year growth, but now are\nvery profitable, right?\nAnd, you know, for sure, more customers,\nrevenue much higher, but you got to\nfigure out a new way to grow your\ncompany.\nYeah, before figure out a new way to\nfurther grow the company back to higher\ngrowth, for sure, the investors, they,\nthey want to wait and see.\nThat's very fair.\nSo, when you think about new growth\nlevers for this business moving forward,\nare we going to get into some sci-fi\nstuff here?\nLike, uh, how far away are we from the\nStar Wars holograms?\nLike, if, if what you did to Cisco,\nright, like was a step function change,\nwhat's the step function change from\nhere?\nYou, you are so right.\nLiterally this morning, I was chatting\nwith the engineers, you know, what's the\nnext innovation, a lot of other things,\nlike immersive experience, for sure, you\nknow, can change the way for us to, to\ncommunicate, right?\nThat's, but it will take some time, you\ngot to be patient, right?\nYou know, take like a in a 3D immersive\nvideo conference experience, you know, uh,\nit's not ready yet, but we need to make\nsure get ourself, you know, technology\nwise ready, but\n\n\nEven if, as you know, you cannot reach the mainstream, but you look at AI, the AR immersive experience, that's a future. In particular, AI, you know, we are transforming our business from a video collaboration company to be an AI-first, you know, uh, AI-first system of actions. You know, like every video conferencing, every phone call, and it can become to leverage AI technology. Guess what? You know, after the meeting, we can create a task, we can assign an action item to you, we can follow, right? And it's become a system of actions, right? It's it's going to be more and more powerful.\n\nYou know what's crazy is that uh, I had a guest on the show at some point. His name was Rony Abovitz. Do you know who that is? Do you know who Ron is? He started Magic Leap. Yeah. Yeah. And Magic Leap was doing this hologram stuff like 15 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. At that time, I was so excited because I really need, you know, make sure on other startup companies to come up with some, you know, breakthrough hardware technology and then our software can integrate with them. But, you know, it takes some time for any hardware to become a mainstream device and to create an immersive experience.\n\nWell, it's fun to think about the future as it relates to Zoom because, you know, if you look at the um OpenAI acquisition that uh of Jony Ive's firm, right? Jony Ive was basically, he innovated the form factor of the iPhone and the MacBook. Yep. And obviously, Zoom is the benefactor of that. But if you hear and listen to their interviews now, I don't think any of those, the form factors that they're thinking about for how to deliver AI to consumers is not going to be on a laptop. And it doesn't even seem like it would be like a wearable. I, I don't know, but I just really interesting to see like, boy, like, are people even going to want to communicate through computers in the same way? Uh, yes and no, because you look at the AI, for sure, if I'm my iPhone is is good enough, right? I can talk with the ChatGPT, you know, and talk with other AI agents. But however, the some other experience, you know, take the immersive video conference video conference experience, for example, in the future, I think desktop experience probably much better, much bigger screen, right? And of course, you know, you think about the imagine the world where in the future, you and I sitting anywhere in the world, when I have a video conferencing, you feel like we're sitting together, can shake your hands, you feel my hand is shaking, hand shaking, I give a hug, you feel my intimacy, right? I think those experiences when we not only happen in the mobile on mobile, but also on desktop, laptop, the big, you know, video conferencing room screen as well, right? I think that I, I think, you know, every device will support that. I do not think in the future everyone just count on one device, you know, different use case, you know, different the the devices, all of them, I think it will be very important.\n\nAre you Um, are you happy you're not an entrepreneur in China and that you're an entrepreneur here? I think when I started 1997, for sure, you know, like at that time, you know, the internet is already booming, right? Everybody used Yahoo, Netscape. At that time, there's, you know, 1997, you know, very few people heard about the internet. That's one of the reasons, you know, remember, actually, I why I came to here because I was, I live in Yokohama, Japan, and Bill Gates, he was there to give a keynote speech. I was so fascinated about his speech and the first time I played the Netscape in a browser, you know, there's a Netscape, you know, you know, you know, market company, the first time I played a Netscape navigator, I said, wow, that's amazing. I think this browser is going to change everything, you know, how to write a wave of that innovation, right? That's the reason why I decided to move to Silicon Valley. That's 1997.\n\nWow, when you were growing up, what was childhood like for you? What was what was what were was Did you have sisters, brothers? Yeah. Were your parents involved in your life in the way that you're involved in your kids' life? So, both of my parents, they were geology engineers, and they give me a lot of flexibility. You know, I'm I was not like a, you know, always try to pursue grade A students. I did spend a lot of time to hang out, you know, with my friends. I probably I I I spend way too much time on playing majang or poker. So, you know, from uh, uh, junior high school, high school in the college, only until I after I graduated from college, I realized, gee, you know, all other classmates, they're so smart, they leave, they focus on the study. I spend all the time visit my time on so many other things, you know, I feel like that's not smart. Afterwards, I feel like I understand what should I do in the future and every day think about what I can do to become a better person for myself, become a better version for myself, and I have a dream, right? To really embrace technology, somebody I'm going to start a company, you know, at that time, I feel like I truly understood the future.\n\nYeah, as you think about the next 5 to 10 years of this company, do you feel like, like I've had a lot of conversations with incumbent companies, okay, uh, with the generational SAS companies that we've known for the last 15 years. And I put you like squarely in that category. You know that like there's a lot of people waking up every day salivating about the idea of doing exactly what you did, rebuilding the architecture from someone's going to say Zoom can't do what they're saying they need to do. They need to rebuild their entire architecture from the ground up. AI native. Mhm. Do you think about that? Yeah, I do. That's the reason why I like a sports, you bring is ultimate sports, right? Meaning you are facing competitors every day everywhere, right? I'm pretty sure the way for us to think about the competition is we have to keep innovating. We have to think about we are still a startup. If you lose that the manage side, we are going to lose very quickly because our competitors is huge ones and the smaller startups, you know, a lot of competitions. If we really focus on the the the customer experience, you know, don't always think about protect, you know, our existing business, think about whatever we can do differently to keep delivering happiness to customers, keep working hard, we are still a startup, we are okay as long as we do not lose the velocity.\n\nI think we can survive. Do you consider yourself a demanding CEO? I ask because, like I said earlier, your approval ratings, the love that your employees feel for you is higher than I've ever seen. I demand a lot, and again, I I keep everything open, transparent, you know, to the entire company, to entire employee base. I demand myself a lot too. They can demand a lot to me as well. I do not call that demanding. I call that is kind of a urgency to get a thing done right and velocity. Velocity is is number one thing for us to compete against other bigger competitors. We lose the speed, we lose everything. Why? Why you know, why not finish this task today? Why you want to wait next week or next months? You know, like you'll challenge your team like that. I challenge my team. I challenge myself. They also can challenge me as well. That's our common culture. Do you think your velocity is high today? Like if you were giving a sober assessment? Not as high as I expect. And how many people are in the company? We have around 7,500.\n\nLike, isn't that the problem? Meaning, can you ever be extremely high velocity when you have that many people? It's you're so right. It's very hard. But if you do not push, the problem is getting worse. Even if you push, that not mean everything will move very fast, you know, in a sustainable way. That's not the case. But you still need to push. But 7500 is like a battleship, right? It's big. And you know, all these people have Zoom stock, right? They've all made a lot of money at this company. They all have, you know, resistance to change because they have more to lose than they used to. They have big nice jobs. They have big teams. Why would they change, right? There's no incentive. No, that's an incentive because we happen to have our all hands meeting this morning. I always share with our employees. We, the way I look at the business, I want to make sure the employee look at the same way because I want to make sure all of us when we retire down the road, look back, we feel like we feel proud of working at Zoom. We all became a better version of ourselves. They all become better, you know, the the engineers or better, you know, sales people because it's not only benefit Zoom, also will benefit them, benefit their families as well. They all want to become better. If all of our employees become better off for themselves, guess what? The company become better, right? That's the reason why the incentive for for, you know, from employee perspective, if they keep working hard, they keep improving, they become better, business will benefit, benefit the family, benefit themselves, also benefit. That's a win-win, win-win. I always share with the team about that philosophy.\n\nAnd if you think your velocity is not as fast as you would like it to be, now what can you do? I think only one thing I can do is, which is double down on company culture, make sure everyone really understands that what's the company culture. You got to deliver happiness to customers. When customer asking anything to you today, you you should figure out a way how to respond today. How to fix that problem today rather than tomorrow, next months, right? If everyone think about everything from others perspective, in particular from customers perspective, they are going to have a sense of urgency. Even if there new processes, they are going to figure out a way to deliver something to delight customers.\n\nBut isn't this why going to my earlier question of you being the founder CEO that might feel stuck? You can't just bring in a CEO who says my only solution is to double down on culture. It's your culture. The culture is one thing. It's a foundation, right? You know, it's a foundation to help you achieve something faster. You have a solid culture. But culture without a great culture, you you really you really cannot achieve a lot of things. You know, meaning, let's say if you have a task, you know, customer waiting for for next months, if you don't have a great culture, you know, your employee will say, ah, let's wait, I have so many other, you know, team, I call on other team, I need to wait, customer tell me to do this, to tell me to do that, I cannot deliver in next six months, you're going to lose very quickly.\n\nYeah, I just think about this idea of like, no one else could reinforce the culture of Zoom like you can. Don't you think? For sure, you know, founder, especially founder CEO will play a much bigger role, but you also needed to hire a a greater team around you, you know, talent is very important. I, you need to make sure, you know, all those senior leaders around me, they are all great, right? And the the the leaders, you know, and the front of the managers, you know, if you have a greater team, everything will be easier. That's the reason why you have a greater culture, greater team, and uh, you can push the the the getting it forward faster, and otherwise, you are going to lose very, very quickly. As a lifelong engineer and then engineering leader, what did you struggle with or get most surprised by becoming the CEO?\n\nI think of in my case, uh, even if I was engineer and I was VP engineer along the way, I, you know, when I was a kid, I, you know, I I wanted to make money, I wanted to sell something essentially. If I start over, I wanted to be a salesperson, account executive to sell the our product, you know, to build a product is one thing, to sell the product, the customer make sure customer understanding value, they feel very happy to buy a product, that's I think that's a kind of a that's even harder, I think. But I enjoy that. And for me, actually, naturally, I I I, even if I'm an engineer, I wrote a lot of code, naturally, I think I learn, I learn a lot about go to market, you know, marketing and sales, you know, the The day when I started the company, I feel like I'm not engineer, I'm already, I already understood, I already understood how marketing works or how how the sales work, right? Especially I I always care about customer, I look at everything from a customer perspective. By doing that, I can learn from others, then you can learn a lot of other things, even finance, you can learn. So, where do you think organizations go wrong, like uh, this idea of this idea of looking through the lens of a customer sounds good, right? Amazon is famous for being customer obsessed. Um, but it where do you think in practice things go sideways? Like where where's the tradeoff?\n\nThat's a great question. So, in every company is different. If you focus on build a product for consumer or for developers or for enterprises. Yeah. You know, if you if you build a product for consumers, sometimes, you know, might have a big gap. You know, some maybe you talk to a few customers, all of them might tell you something may not be right. Right. You know, take iPhone for example. Remember at that time, everyone talk about, oh, we need a keyboard. All those consumers were not right. Apple was right. You do not need a keyboard. But if you build a product for enterprise customers, most of time those interpret customer, they are right because the reason why they share is their pinpoint is to their daily, you know, the pinpoint. You got to truly listen to those customers. Well, you cannot see, ah, you are not right. I build something differently. you then you're going to make a mistake. So, the first thing you look at your your customer base, consumers or developers or enterprise customers, then you should have a different philosophy. Let's assume it's enterprise. What do you think the trade-offs are that people get wrong? So, sometimes because you really care about customers, many customer tell you I want you build this feature, you want I want you build that feature. What if you have 10 enterprise consors, they tell you build two 10 different features, you'll be stuck. However, the right things to do is don't listen to their problems. Don't listen to their solution because you got to understand when they share the problem with you. You try to understand what's root cause. Quite often human nature, they tell you what to do, give you a solution. You should take a step back. Don't focus on solution, focus on problem. And 10 in customers give you 10 different solutions. Guess what? If you take a step back, analyze, realize is one problem, one root cause, just one solution. Focus on the problem. Do not focus on solution. When you work together with enterprise customers, have you seen are there other companies that you admire that have a customer obsession that you think is the right way of doing it? A lot. You know, here in Silicon Valley, you look at the ServiceNow is, you know, be on our board is great, and the Salesforce, you know, so many Workday as well, a lot of great uh enterprise companies, you know, they really listen to customer, understand customer painpoint, they build innovative solutions a lot. By the way, I was talking to Carl about you.\n\n\nRecently Ashinbach, and he, oh, he's an amazing leader. He loves you. He says, \"Tell Eric, he can call me whenever he wants.\" And I was thinking in the back of my mind, I suspect Eric knows that he could probably pick up the phone and call you. He's my brother, and anything I'll do for him. Yeah, that's amazing. He's great. He was with you yesterday. Was he there yesterday? Yes, he was. Yeah. Yeah. He's also, he was on my board for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's truly enjoyed working together. He's a gem. He's a... He's doing a good job at Workday. Yeah. That's the reason why you feel very lucky living in Silicon Valley. So many world-class leaders, you know, here. So, you... you really can learn a lot from them. And what's crazy is like the people that you have just mentioned, like the three companies that you just mentioned that you admire, Bill McDermott at ServiceNow, Carl Ashinbach, and Beni off, they're all still going. They still work very, very hard, and they have no reason to. Yeah. Another example, Oracle as well, Larry. Larry, you know, I... I admire him a lot. He's still working so hard, still very hands-on, and as amazing leader. It's great. They're still going. Absolutely. They have no reason to go, and they're leading by example that like great operators operate for a long time. They all set up a great example for the young startup founders. That's the reason why CIC is so successful. Remember, this is a key reason. So do you feel that responsibility still right now, like as you think about, should I retire or should I not, is setting that example sometimes? When I think about a retirement, for sure, I... I... I... you know, from time to time, I... I did, but look at for what others, you know, what other founders did, you know, you feel like others still working so hard, so you know, you better follow other leaders. But what would you do if you were retired? Like, wouldn't you miss being at Zoom?\n\nI... I think if I have time, I'd like to give back, you know, maybe, you know, talk with some, you know, the young, you know, entrepreneurs, maybe teach something in the classroom. I... I... I really want to give back because I learned a lot along the way. A lot of people have to me, you know, I want to give back as well. Yeah, that makes sense. I really appreciate you doing this. My pleasure, because, uh, you know, I really enjoy your... your... your podcast. I'm a huge fan, and, uh, yeah, so why not? So I really appreciate you doing this. You're... you're... there's it is not surprising to me in the slightest that you are beloved by so many people in... in the valley. Thank you. Thank you. I feel very fortunate. I live in the Silicon Valley. It is a best innovative culture. So many great world-class leaders, and every day I just enjoy that, and it doesn't... it kind of feel like we're... it's like a rebirth recently, like, uh, with AI. You are so right, huh? Like, it's vibrant. Like, whenever people I have maybe like career calls where people ask me about their, you know, the up-and-coming salesperson or whatever, first question I ask them, \"Where do you live?\" \"A Boston.\" \"Austin.\" I'm like, \"What are... like, move to the Bay Area, then let's have this call again. Move to the Bay Area, then let's talk again.\" I wish I will be like 21 years old and just graduate from college. I will immediately start an AI company. You would? Yeah. Just to ride the wave like you did of the internet wave. Yeah. Yeah. This time, unprecedented, and I think we more any other previous, you know, paradigm shift, like a mobile era, PC era, or or or internet error, this AI era, oh my god. What gives you that confidence? You look at what's happening over the past two years. You look at all the AI technology. Is it the rate of change of the technology, or is it the technology itself? Two things: the potential of this technology and also the innovation speed. You look at all those models, look at what they can do two years ago, and look at it today. Like, by the way, yesterday on our earning call, for the first time in history, uh, Zoom, uh, uh, uh, uh, AI-generated avatar participated in the earning call as my avatar joined our earning call yesterday. I never thought about that many years ago. Remember, for every public company, every quarter earning call, either you record a script or you read a script. I do not like that experience. Finally, I can enjoy earning call now. I do not need to record anything. I give my AI avatar to my marketing team. I just recorded a 30-second video. I call that my AI avatar to our marketing team. They use that AI avatar with a script, could be 10 minutes. One click generator generated a video they can play back in earning call. It's an amazing experience. Did you use Cynthia for that? No, our own. Oh, okay. Yeah, we have a service called Zoom Clips to support. And were you on the call? Yes, it's... No, for the first 10 minutes I was on a call, but we played our... my AI... our for the earning script. Yeah. Two or three years ago, I never thought about that. Today, it's becoming reality. And you mentioned you're unbelievably excited, but you also get scared sometimes. For sure. What do you get scared about? Because you think about, you know, so many things, let's say when AI becomes so powerful, do I still have a job, even as CEO? Do I still have a job, right? Imagine all those digital assistants, even in a future digital twin, they become smarter and smarter, even smarter than human being. What kind of society will be at that time, right? And that's one thing. Another thing, given the so powerful technology technology. You know, what if... what if the bad people, they leverage this technology at that time? It'd be very easier to disrupt, you know, society. I create so many bad things as well because this technology is so powerful and so easy to get to access, right? That's the reason why you feel like, ah, there's so many greater things and so many potential negative things as... cuz no one has a greater answer because this is a brand new technology in the human history, the first time. But don't we feel that way about every brand new technology as a society? AI is different. Whenever you build any... any new technology, guess what? They build by human beings, you know, just to make us make our lives better, to assist whatever doing. We never build something that we smarter than us. This first time in human history, smarter as defined by... by essentially we are human being, but we are created... we are creating digital human being. Yeah, but in some ways they're dumber, and in some ways they're much smarter. Eventually, on many ways, they're smarter. They can learn quickly. They sure can. Yes. That's the reason why they become smarter and smarter. And the models really haven't even started training themselves yet. They just started. We're still training the models. Yeah. So that's the reason why, you know, just over the past two years, you look at the innovation speed, that's unbelievable. It's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. Also exciting. Yeah. Well, thank you. Um, are you hiring? Yeah, we are. We are hiring a lot of AI engineers in... in Seattle and here as well. And those are the two hubs. Yeah. Yeah. I ask every guest this. Um, when you hear the word grit, what do you think of? I think about you have a dream. Keep working hard, you know, pursue your dream. Don't stop. You're, uh, you're, uh, everything and more, uh, that I was hoping you would be. And I just really appreciate you coming here. I appreciate the example that you set. And, um, you know, I... you kind of break a mental model for me, which is that my worldview is that most CEOs and founders that I know that have built the type of company that you have built, I would never work for. I would never work for them. There just something about it, and you break that mold for me. Thank you for having me. I really appreciate. Thank you. So I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. That's it for now. If you like the episode, please leave us a review or go back into the archives where we've done more than 200 episodes with some fantastic folks.
