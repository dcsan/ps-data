  "cleanText": "[Music]\nPeter Gaster, it's so great to see you here today.\nYeah.\nWe've known each other for a very long time.\nToo long.\nToo long.\nYeah.\nWhen you know somebody for a majority of your life, then that's a long time.\nYeah.\nWell, when I first talked to you back in 2017 about this thing called Vehicle Intelligence, a category that you guys have since created, what did you see at that time when you had this crazy idea?\nYeah, I I think we very fundamentally believe, you know, we both come from the car business, like we grew up in the business, our families are in the business.\nI think we fundamentally believe that the car is going to become a software thing.\nHow that becomes a software thing is what we've kind of explored for nearly a decade now by building tools and operating system etc and autonomy and now I think there's this like very clear Vehicle Intelligence category that we're we're building but it wasn't like we knew exactly how everything was going to unfold but we knew software in cars is going to be a big deal yeah and we knew that there's so many more things you can do when you bring advanced computing and software into vehicles and it just sort of the recognition of how many possibilities there were.\nThat was the inspiration for for the company.\nYou know, when you think about these vehicles, they're all pretty dumb.\nThey don't do much.\nYou you have humans who really turn them on, move them, park them, move dirt, you know, whatever whatever the the machine might do.\nAnd so we think we are really at the first steps of bringing intelligence into this giant category of products.\nYeah.\nSo we've talked about Vehicle Intelligence a few times now.\nHow do you actually define it?\nSo uh good question.\nSo it's uh we roughly operate in three product categories.\nThey all kind of work together but are also independent.\nIt's the engineering tools that the you know manufacturers use to develop the software and deploy it onto their vehicles.\nIt's the operating system so that actually sits on these vehicles and then it's the applications on that operating system.\nSo in our in our case most specifically or most obviously it's autonomy but there are other applications uh yeah so it's like tools OS apps and there many subproducts within those categories.\nYeah.\nAnd that's been also the journey of the company right?\nExactly.\nWe started in tools and we're all the way now in in autonomy.\nBut yeah, we work across all technical domains.\nAnd what's really great both for us and our customers is that when you do tools well, you can make the OS better.\nWhen you do OS well, you make the autonomy better.\nIf you do autonomy well, you make the tools better.\nThey all really work well together.\nAnd each customer has a different strategy.\nAnd so they can work with us in whichever way that best suits their needs.\nWhere we have a spectrum of options in terms of all the different technologies that you have under the roof at Applied Intuition.\nThere's a lot going on.\nI'm curious, are there things that you're prioritizing currently more than others perhaps?\nYeah, all of our values, our company values can be roughly summarized into two words, which is radical pragmatism.\nAnd what that means to answer that question is we prioritize what our customers prioritize.\nWe're fortunate enough that work with a diversity of customers in basically all around the world.\nEach of them have a slightly different priority.\nI'm equally excited about all three product categories.\nYou know, it's like parents.\nYou have no favorite child.\nI don't I don't know if you have a Well, well, yeah.\nI mean, so so it's uh it's of course not only our direct customers, but also thinking about the the the customers that our customers have, right?\nConsumers.\nThe the consumers or it it could be it could be fleets.\nIt could be industrial companies that are that are actually buying these vehicles.\nAnd of course, we want to provide capabilities to our customers that fundamentally their customers are going to to really get a lot of value out of.\nIn the long horizon of the company, the always the most difficult technical, you know, problems are the ones that are the most interesting.\nAnd I think, you know, you fast forward 5 or 10 years, the intelligence becomes more and more and more and more important.\nAnd even in the last nearly a decade, you know, the AI part of Applied Intuition has become a more and more dominant part of the of the business.\nAnd I think in 10 years, it's really only an AI company in that sense.\nUh but uh you know, you meet the customer at what they need rather than have let's say an arrogance which is like we're going to shove this product to you because we think this is the right product for you.\nThey know their customers way better than we know them.\nSo we work with them very collaboratively.\nYeah.\nSo you guys have secured partnerships with the most demanding vehicle manufacturers in the world.\nIt's an incredible feat to do it in a relatively short period of time.\nHow do these really important partnerships result in the kind of products you develop and just generally your product direction?\nWe have lots of I would say strengths in the company that have helped us succeed but probably near the top of the list is we know our markets quite well like we come from the markets right so I went to the General Motors Institute you know Peter's family par father grandfather etc worked in automotive and you're both from Michigan yeah we're both from the same area too we're from the same same neighborhood literally uh and so\nI think you end up knowing a market in a way that It's very hard to just pick up.\nThat's been massive for us.\nYou can ask your customers what do they want, what do they need, how much are they willing to pay for in Silicon Valley software companies or AI companies.\nThat analogy of, you know, know your customers really like be a consumer company and solve the problem for yourself.\nIn a way, we're solving the problem for ourselves because we grew up in the ecosystem.\nAnd that's been a superpower.\nYou can't just guess the market.\nYou got to really know it and really understand it.\nAnd that makes the customer collaboration way more strategic.\nYeah.\nImmediately.\nYeah.\nAnd and we've been at this for 8 years.\nAnd I think we we've proven ourselves time and again in the industry and and we're now really operating at the time scale of the industry which is always a multi-year relationship in the sense of it can take 5 years to bring a new vehicle to market.\nYeah.\nAbsolutely.\nThis is not a market for quick, fast, dirty and easy.\nIt is safety critical systems that are deployed for a decade plus at a time.\nThe partners are extremely demanding and their expectations of us are very very high.\nSo if you can earn that seat at the table that is a really great position to be in and I think it bodess well for our future.\nYou guys are truly building a generational company with Applied Intuition and congrats on all the progress to date, but I know that you said your work is still all ahead of you, which is why we're doubling down on our investment from a few years ago to lead this round and uh we're really excited about the future and the partnership together.\nYeah, thank you guys for your continued support over the many years and yeah, we still got a lot to go.\n",
