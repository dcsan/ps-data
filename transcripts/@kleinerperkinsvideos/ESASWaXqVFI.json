  "cleanText": "Imprint is a co-branded credit card issuer. We noticed there was a ton of great brands, you know, modern digital platforms like online travel agencies, but also 100-year-old grocery stores like our partner H-E-B Grocery Company, LP that is on this digital transformation. And if you look at the banks they have to work with, they don't prioritize technology. We should build Imprint to give them a better card holder experience, be much more integrated into the brand's app, into the brand's website, and give much better rewards. We raise capital, we hired people. It's really important with those early joiners to treat them as co-founders effectively. It is our company. It is not my company. If you don't find people early on who buy that and you also give them that ownership, you're going to fail. We also have a business model that AI isn't going to disrupt that much. We get to be on the forefront of this technology and we're not an AI company, but we can be a company built on AI.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome to Grit. I'm Joubin, partner at Kleiner Perkins, a show where we go beyond the highlight reel and explore the personal and professional challenges of building history-making companies. Today on Grit, we're in New York City with Daragh Murphy, co-founder and CEO of Imprint. He left a career in law and consulting to reimagine co-branded credit cards for the modern era. We first invested in Imprint in 2021 and since then Daragh and the team have been on a tear raising multiple rounds building an amazing business on the backs of amazing customers. Enjoy the episode.\n\nWell, dude, I'm really excited for you. Like it must be surreal right now. Like you're like opening office. It's got to be cool, right?\n\nYeah, it's it's super cool. This is kind of the This is kind of the dream.\n\nTotally. And it's one of those things though where it's like there's so much promise of it being much bigger, right? Like it's real now and it'd be such a shame if we didn't like if we turned into like one of those companies that kind of like starts to slow down now rather than speed up, right? And so like there's a ton of opportunity for us to speed up.\n\nIs it one of those things like you just raised your C?\n\nYeah.\n\nFrom uh Keith Y at Kosla.\n\nYou now kind of have like the dream cap table. You have like uh product market fit. The company's growing like crazy. You have like this beautiful office in New York. You're growing to another office. You have an office in San Francisco. It's like kind of like if Daragh could like write down like what is like the dream. This is kind of it. Yeah. And when maybe like now that you're actualizing the dream, does it feel like what you thought it would feel like?\n\nNo. And I think that's I think that's like the part of being the founder as well is just like it's just never going to be enough. Like and that's and I think that's it's incredibly it's an incredibly unhealthy way to live. Yeah, but I was actually talking to Keith about this where I was like, you know, sometimes I burn out senior execs and he's like, \"Look, the secret of all these like great founders ever worked with is like they wake up every day and they're just unreasonable all the time.\" Yeah. And I think like my wife tells me like you're never going to enjoy it. Uh, and I think that's probably true, you know, like you're just always trying to be bigger, you know, and I like look at like, you know, it's like it's the problem is it's the company you keep too, right? Like Mimoon has Figma, Rippling. Rippling and there's another one I always think of as well. But so like the company you keep is amazing, right?\n\nSlack box. There's a totally totally right. So like for us then to be relevant, we have to get to like 10 billion in revenue, right? For us to actually be in the like, you know, we're in the game now, but it's like we made it to the NBA. Are we going to be an all-star or are we just going to be like, you know, eighth man on the roster?\n\nY is the way I think about it. I was having a conversation with my team recently about this same topic. Like cuz my team is full of operators that are like kind of stuck in venture with me, right? And we always play the like, would you go work at this company?\n\nTotally.\n\nRight. Like would you go work at this company? Would you work for this founder? And almost always the founder that people are excited to work for, meaning good guy, good girl, like like great boss, supportive is inversely correlated to the performance of the company. Meaning like like if you're a really intense, really demanding, somewhat psychotic in certain areas founder, usually you build the best companies.\n\nSure. And very rarely are you like I can't go wait to work for that person. You know what I mean? Like now it anyway but there's a lot of founders that are just like great people like amazing human beings. They're like I would love to work for that person. You're just such a good person and they're like happy and well adjusted.\n\nYes. But like their company isn't growing. Almost a perfect correlation.\n\nTotally. Like we've been growing like 5% a month for the last few months and I hate it. I'm like it's driving me crazy. Like literally nuts. We'll be back growing at like 30% a month by the back half of the year, but right now it's just like it.\n\nAnd what did you grow last year?\n\nWe went from 25 to 100 in the course of the year of ARR of Yeah. Oh, we don't have ARR, right? We have run rate revenue because it's not contracted per se. Um, and this year we should clip, we should be close to 3x growth from that.\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nYeah. But the problem is like I put a plan out there for the board that's 3.4x. Yeah.\n\nRight. And now like it looks like it'll be three and I'm pulling my hair out, right? And like the lesson for me is like next year I'll put a plan out for the board that's 80% of what will make me pull my hair out. Do you know what I mean?\n\nSo now that it's all happening.\n\nYeah.\n\nCompare and contrast the feeling of having something to lose versus knowing that you're even going to have something to lose. Meaning like you're searching for product market fit. You have no idea if you're going to find it. In the early days we didn't know if we were going to find it.\n\nTotally.\n\nThat's not a very good feeling.\n\nYeah. But interestingly, you have the world to lose now. You've raised all of this money. Expectations are super high. You have 180 people in the company going to double. You have a huge number that you have to hit this year. Like, can you contrast those feelings?\n\nThey're kind of similar. Um, I think there's a couple of stages, right? There's like I remember when we first went to start the company and it wasn't clear if Thrive was going to invest or not. And we were kind of incubating it, kind of going it alone. like you would have given your right arm to just get in the game, right? And I remember like distinctly the feeling I had the day after Thrive wrote wrote the seed check and I was like, \"Holy f, I'm here until the last dollar, right?\" Like, and you just kind of maybe maybe other people get this and maybe I was too stupid to not understand the concept of like but once you take all this money from people, that's it, right? Like you're committed. You're never going to be able to leave. like if you care about your own reputation and you know having a long career, you can't leave until all the money's gone, right? And so, you know, we I know of companies that raised an incredible valuations in 2021 and they have literally $100 million still sitting on their balance sheet that they have barely touched. In fact, the 4% a year they're getting on that funds operations. And so, theoretically, they could be a zombie company forever and they have like three million bucks of revenue now. And that must be so hard. Like, what do you do? are you like I'm just going to keep hitting my head against the wall for 10 years or do I give the money back? I remember having that feeling after we raised and product market fit or like the journey to get there kind of felt like that which was like God I've taken this money from these people and we've hired all these people.\n\nYou still didn't have product market fit when you got the seed or or probably the close to like we were barely had the sniff of product market fit when we raised the series A. We were fortunate enough that um that when Kleiner invested, we were in a conversation for one of Kleiner's portfolio companies and and Moon and John Door at the time kind of were like, \"This is interesting. There's clearly something there if if a company with, you know, four people and a seed round and barely any technology is in a conversation for one of our public companies, right?\" Um but I so like the that period was like we have for me personally was we have all these expectations. We raise capital, we hired people in many cases these people have children and you know they took a pay cut to come here. That just feels like I remember like people ask me question today like what do you lose sleep over or keeps you up at night? Barely nothing today keeps me up at night. But back then I would wake up and just like staring at the ceiling thinking, \"God, we got to deliver for all these people.\" Today it's a little different. Like it doesn't feel as existential. Um, and if I take a step back, I'm not lying awake at night staring at the ceiling thinking, you know, God, we owe these people so much. And also, God, I'm going to live like an idiot. More it feels like we have control of the outcome. And so it just feels like there's more responsibility today versus back then it was more fear.\n\nMhm. How much money have you raised now?\n\nWe've raised 100 230 million and I'd say like that's a lot like that's a fair bit for the size of the company. Maybe can you explain what Imprint does and then obviously like why you had to then go raise the money that you did?\n\nTotally. And we have the vast majority of that still on still on the balance sheet. Right. We are a co-branded credit card company and so everybody has a or most people will have a co-branded credit card in their wallet. They'll have the Delta MX card or the United uh Chase card. Yeah. And effectively a co-brander credit card is bank pairs up with a brand and issues a card to those brands customers. And the brand's customers get a they get credit, they get rewards, they get status, they get a better deal, they get, you know, they're more part of the club, so to speak. And the brand gets customers who have much higher lifetime value. If you put a card in a customer's pocket, they will come back and you use your brand on repeat. They're now part of the club. And the best customers put their hand up to get the card. And it's an awesome uh trade because the brand gets a better customer, the customer gets better rewards and and we as the issuer uh end up with the economics of the banking business, but we have lower customer acquisition costs because we partner with a brand to issue through their channels. Uh so Imprint is a co-branded credit card issuer. Effectively when we built the company what we noticed was there was a ton of great brands and we think about great brands as you know modern digital platforms like online travel agencies but also you know 100-year-old grocery stores like our partner H-E-B Grocery Company, LP that is on this digital transformation and what we notice is these brands are all trying to build digital experiences. They're really trying to put the customer first and if you look at the banks they have to work with they they don't prioritize technology. They don't own their own technology stacks. So that even if they wanted to prioritize technology, they could. They rent their stacks from third parties. And there's no incentive for them to actually make a better customer experience because these banks make between 40 and 80% of their net income from late fees, from insufficient fund fees. So actually friction and bad experience powers the profit pool for these banks. And our insight was there's these new brands out there. There's these digital platforms. There's these incumbents that are modernizing. And they want to give their customers a great experience. We should build Imprint to give them a better card holder experience, be much more integrated into the brand's app, into the brand's website, and give much better rewards. And what we found is, we actually did this at the last board meeting, for 100% of the digital platforms that we've gone into a competitive process for, we've won all of them. And which is awesome, right? Because it proves the thesis correctly. What's even better for us is for three out of four grocery stores that have been around for 100 years that we've pitched, we're have either won them or the final round to win them, right? And so the TAM is much bigger than we even thought it was at the start because so many brands are having to modernize and the banks are just stuck in frankly 1970.\n\nHow do you think about the equity versus like debt and financing on the back end?\n\nYeah. So the great thing for us is the partnerships are massive, right? And so when we win a partner, each partner can be a hundred $200 million P&amp;L and today we have six or seven of those partners live or launching. And so we've raised a lot of capital. It's anticipation of that kind of ramp from here. We grew a lot last year, we're going to grow a lot this year and next year. Um equity really is for us to invest in the growth of partners. When we give you a credit card, uh we have to pay customer acquisition costs. We have to underwrite the customer. All of the equity we've raised is really going to go into the growth to lend money to a consumer. We don't use our own equity. Just like a bank, we go and we borrow the money in the wholesale markets, right? So, we have securizations. Um, actually, we have our first securization coming up. We also have these big arrangements with uh City Bank, with Truist, with Muho where they will lend money against the assets.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nYeah.\n\n\nIt is a very complicated business. Yeah. Like there's a lot of just like moving pieces. Anytime I hear the pitch, Joubin, we only need 50 customers and we're going to build a big public company, I always get really nervous because I'm like, well, like you better nail those 50 totally and you better make sure they love you. Like the my my the like seller in me, my gut is like that's a pretty like non-re repeatable long slog. And in your case, you might actually only need 50 to 100. Maybe I think we I think we need 15 to 20. 15 to 20. And you're like halfway there.\n\nAnd that's because like uh let's just say H-E-B Grocery Company, LP, which is call it Safeway of the Midwest. Is that fair? It's the biggest grocery store in Texas. It's the most beloved grocery store in America. Yeah. If you look at sales per store, sales per household, I think it's like Costco and H-E-B Grocery Company, LP are one and two. And basically neck and neck. They'll take like a bite of the apple and then over time they'll just grow to their entire customer base.\n\nIt's crazy business. Yeah. On the fundraising piece, I always hear the venture capital perspective of too much versus too little money. Do you have a point of view on that? Like you've raised 250 or whatever. You have this amazing board. Most of that money is on your balance sheet. So you haven't spent it. You may or may not spend it. In most cases, people don't end up spending anything past like B or C depending on the business, you know. Yeah. How do you think about that?\n\nA couple things. First of all, that I think the money can be a drug and you can totally lose your way with too much of it. We you do believe that. Oh, of course. And then the question becomes, can you be sober in the face of all the money, right? And so, you know, you were complimenting us on our new office. you know, we only move our new office is going to cost us like one uh it's going to cost us 30 basis points of revenue when we open it, right? And so it's not like we're spending a lot of money on things like that. Similarly, if you measure us on revenue per employee, we have about like 700 $800,000 of revenue per employee. And if you compare that to public companies, we're almost at new bank levels in terms of revenue to to efficiency, right? And so I think you have to be very sober in the face of the money. Um but the reason for us to raise the money isn't to go spend it on nice offices or you know perks like uh beautiful offsites four times a year. It's because when an big enterprise is choosing us, right? And you you talked about H-E-B Grocery Company, LP. They've been around for 100 years, family-owned, huge trust factor with their customers. when they choose us, they could choose a bank like Barclays US that's been around for 400 years and has a balance sheet in the hundreds of billions for their credit cards. Like this is not like a little thing.\n\nNo. And and it's like the most important thing for their customers lives too because we could ru their credit, you know. Um if there's a fraud attack, it hurts them and they don't blame us, they blame the partner, right, on the brand, like the logo on the card. And so for us to raise the capital, it's really to show these partners that we will be around for a long time, right? And you can make the what is what may feel like an irrational decision to choose us over a big bank. And you talked about selling like we're so cognizant of the fact and we talk about it all the time that our buyer has asymmetric downside. And what I mean by that is you choose a big old bank and the customer experience kind of sucks. Your boss is going to look at all the other experiences and go we couldn't have done that much better. And you never ever lose your job. And maybe you get promoted. Yeah. It's like you never get fired for buying IBM. Imprint and we do a good job and maybe you get promoted in a year, we mess it up as it feels like we could and then you may get fired, right? And who wants those asymmetric downside bets? And so we're very cognizant of that. Part of raising the capital is not to go and have nice offices as we talked about. It's to show our partners that through a downturn, through the cycle, we'll be there, right? And it hasn't been the most dilution optimal thing for us to do. In fact, I wish we and we could have many times chosen to have less capital in the balance sheet. You know, you're talking about we need to have 20 partners to be a big public company. Every one of the sales processes matters and so we have to make sure that we look maybe not like IBM but like the Startup equivalent.\n\nYeah. It is interesting though like there's so many companies that raised during the Zer COVID era that had a artificially inflated product market fit meaning it wasn't as good as they thought. the TAM wasn't as big as they thought and they weren't consuming as much of that TAM as they thought. And as a founder, that's a really tricky situation because you have 100 plus million on your like that you've raised. What do you do in that situation? Like you've raised at a really high valuation, which is a tricky spot.\n\nTotally tricky. And we lost our minds in 2021 after we'd raised our series A because we didn't fully understand the market we were in. And so we had product market fit up market for these big brands, but we were trying to sell to little brands. So we were really trying to get Glossier and Away and these brands to launch a credit card, which was silly cuz the brands knew their customers wouldn't want it. And they had so many other priorities that wasn't a credit card. You were trying to convince them to start their first ever corporate card. Our whole thing was not corporate card, consumer cards. Our whole our whole view was let's start down market, right? And it'll be easier to sell to startups and then we'll move up market. And what we realized was nobody down market wanted it. And rather than look up market, we kind of said, \"Oh my god, this isn't working.\" And instead, we started to build other products. And we looked at a couple of startups that have since gone bust that raised series A's or B's at the time, and we were like, well, they're doing that. Let's copy that. And so, we probably wasted eight months and, you know, I don't want to say how many million dollars chasing the wrong product market fit. And then we got fortunate that we got our first credit card program for a midsize brand. And that was kind of, oh, actually, stop. Don't waste our time trying to copy others. Stick with the original thesis. It'll work. But I honestly feel like we got lucky rather than we were good and that we got the right inbound or the right introduction at the right time.\n\nGoing back to the like money on the balance sheet thing, can you talk about like when are the trade-offs actually happening of not being frivolous? From what I have seen, if you get more money, you spend more money. Whether that's personally, if you make more money, you tend to spend more money. Y if you're a company, if you earn more money, you spend more money. If you raise more money, you spend like it's just human nature. Yeah. Where do you think the tradeoffs are of like all right like Daragh, we have a I don't know, is it like we have a holiday party, let's spend an extra 2 million or we have an office change, let's do that. Or does it tend to creep in in more subtle ways like oh we can spend 10% on salary extra maybe that's a good thing I don't know like where do you feel like some of those is it the big ones or the more subtle things that creep in\n\nI think it's both to give you a bad answer right like we're fortunate that we grew up in Zer era 2020 we were children in the zer era era right we were like and we got a bunch of money and then VC winter hits in 2022 2023 but but fintech was the worst hit, right? Like you look at the public company stocks like Coinbase and they were like 7x draw downs from their high and and they're back up again today. And so we were very cognizant of every dollar might be our last, right? And we raised a series B that was flat from Ribbit. It wasn't a down round, but it was pretty close, right? And so I feel like our DNA has always been we should be frivolous. I also grew up with like very little money, so that's helpful. Um but where it comes up is like we're talking here publicly about having $140 million $130 million in the balance sheet when um we end up at the end of the year trying to do you know our review cycle and merit based increases for the team. It can be really hard to stand up in front of the team and say, \"Hey, rather than giving everybody a 20% raise,\" and which many of you deserve, we're going to keep the money because we think it's better for us to invested in growth because it'll appreciate your equity. And it's, you know, the marginal office party isn't what's actually going to matter. It's the fact that if you take, you know, headcount burn and multiply it all by 1.2, that's a one-way ratchet, right? The onetime office party is probably helpful for morale. In fact, if you look at our team, we had 100 people this time last year when we had uh a quarter of the revenue we have today, right? We have 150 160 people today when we have um 4x the revenue, right? So like nonlinear headcounter revenue growth and that's helpful too, right? Because you're trying to keep your expense base down. But it's it's the small things that matter less than I think these like bigger things that are cultural and harder for you as the leader of the company to stand up and talk about.\n\nYeah, that makes total sense. On average, the the data shows us that if you're an AI company, yeah, you raise at a 30% premium to non-AI company. So naturally, then what ends up happening like everyone becomes, you know, Imprint on AI or whatever, right? Like everyone everyone just changes to an AI company even if they're not. And if you're a fintech lending business, I think it's more like 80% higher, right? Exactly. Does that frustrate you? Like how do you how does that actually I mean of course it's frustrating, right? Does that give you the like envy thing of like I look over to my left and right and I'm like my business is in as good if not better shape than AI or not most of these other companies but I'm not getting valued in the same way.\n\nTotally. My brother always tells me envy is the is the thief of joy and I think he's dead right. Um Charlie Munger says that too by the way. I completely agree. It it is the worst of the feelings to feel. Totally. And I think to be super open, like I moved to New York when I was 21 and I was lucky to get a job at a big law firm, but I had no money. I like had $3,000 of credit card debt and my best friend and I uh and I'll actually be the best man at his wedding pretty soon would send each other money every every month when we were short, right? But I would like had to go buy a suit because I was working at a white shoe law firm. And so I had 10 years in New York of like I'm will like for the first three years working at a law firm like I'm stuck here till like 11 p.m. and it's a Thursday and if you open it wasn't Instagram at the time. I it was it probably was Instagram and you see people heading to the Hamptons and you're like like what am I doing wrong with my life right? Um and so I think at some point though you have to get over it and I think that's actually been helpful training now with the startup. I think the other thing I've seen is we talked about pre-product market fit and looking at others and and wishing you had their logo list and those companies are no longer around. You kind of have to let it go. And the thing about most of these AI companies is like that's not true. The thing about half of the eye companies is they actually have a really interesting product and use case on the forefront of technology. And so for me to sit here and be envious is like kind of silly.\n\nYeah. Right. The other thing is AI has probably helped us in a weird way. As I talk to growth equity investors, there aren't that many growth equity companies at our stage today because of VC winter and uh particularly in fintech because there just wasn't that much funding. And so we're one of a small cohort that survived. We also have a business model that AI isn't going to disrupt that much. AI will enhance our business model and we focus on that all the time to make us more efficient and have better return on equity in the long term. But it's actually kind of helpful today because growth equity investors are saying, \"I can invest in this AI company at a massive valuation or I can invest in this nonAI company, but this non-AI company is not like these other companies because AI isn't going to destroy their business model, right?\" And so that's actually been helpful to us in a weird way. And so that's how I'm finding the silver lining in not being as highly valued.\n\nHave you noticed when you recruit employees? This really took me by surprise when I joined the venture side of the world. I always thought if you're an employee, you want to join a company with a lower valuation obviously, right? Your strike price is lower, your 409A is lower, but human psychology tends not to work that way. Yeah. Meaning like if you I don't know if it's the press or publicity or what it is, but if for some reason you let's just say you're valued at 600 million today and then you're valued at $6 billion in 5 years from now, I'm not sure it would be any less or more difficult to recruit people, which is surprising to me cuz like right now they should be joining. You know what I mean? Like have you noticed that?\n\nI think people you got to separate people into different camps. you just end up hiring different people at different stages of the company. And for some people, the six billion isn't that they're not thinking about long-term return. They're thinking about like this will be better than my corporate job as as even most $6 billion startups are in terms of ability to move quickly and\n\n\nand take ownership\nand learn a lot, but I'm not potentially going to have to turn around to my, you know, spouse and say I can't help pay the mortgage. I'm not going to turn to my parents and say, \"Yeah, I was double Harvard and used to work at this at Google and I traded it all away for this company that then went bust.\" And I think depending where you are in the risk aversion, you're making a choice based on that. And so I think\n and it's important when you're recruiting as well to look for the people that are going to match where the company is. Like we barely have HR at Imprint. If you're if you're I mean we do have HR now, right? But like it's a last six-month thing. If your laptop has a problem, you go fix it yourself. There isn't like it can talk to the help desk and wait for and of course we're investing in those things now as we get bigger, but in reality there's one IT person that can help you and they're probably busy on something else\n and you want people who are going to say that's opting into that, right? Which is like a little less structure. You know, we it's it's hard for people when they come from tech pure technology at the same stage to us because we are in a regulated industry and we are dealing with credit risk and KYC AML and a bunch of for regulations. And so we do have to slow down in places that other companies don't. But I think on average for people who come and want to be at this stage, you want to be make make sure you're finding those people and and and type matching correctly.\n Yep. That's fair. And in many ways like on the valuation point when the macro got hit so hard and fintech got hit so specifically hard\n having the series A valuation that wasn't obscene gave you the flexibility to bring on you're laughing like a\n oh I think it was obscene, right? Like I remember telling me it was like just like you should close this deal, this is a great deal\n right\nwell well to be fair every great company feels very expensive\n like if you Ask Mimoon, he's going to be like, \"All of my best companies always felt very expensive, but it was still a series A, meaning it wasn't like done at a billion dollars.\" And it gave you the flexibility to bring on an amazing partner at the B.\n Yep. at a not horrible down round, like a flat round to your point, like as opposed to you're a $5 billion company who got valued in 2022 and now you're like barely growing bunch of money on the balance sheet. It's tricky. You just like lose a lot of optionality. No, for sure. For sure. And I we're we're fortunate, you know, at any one time, this is the whole envy thing you're talking about, like at any one time you could be looking around and saying, I wish I had X-ray. I wish I had Y. I think we've been fortunate in the way it happened and that's all luck, right? Or or timing rather than skill because I often joked last year that if we were growing at the pace we were last year and this year and it was 2021, we'd be a four or five billion dollar company, right? Um but that would be unhealthy and would it would be a lot of work to grow into it. I think we're marginally undervalued right now relative to our success, but that's just fine because\n the great thing we've had is and this is something I've learned along the way. You want people to come invest and feel like there's upside the next day because if they don't feel like there's upside the next day, their human nature is that they're going to start to worry. Did I make a bad investment? And then if they start to play tight around their investment and they're checking in and how's it going? I just put my reputation on the line with my partners for this. LPs are watching. Then that starts to infect your behavior too.\nWhereas I feel like I'm really fortunate because one of the things Keith told us after the series C was he came to the first board meeting and goes this is great. There was no surprises and\n which is rare\n which is but which is awesome because suddenly I'm like okay I don't have to worry that Keith is worried, right? Like I know there's tons of value and upside he we've already created for him and that's actually been a very healthy thing for us\n especially given how paranoid and you know focused on the success I am, it wouldn't help me to have partners around the table\n that are breathing down your neck\n and I think the other thing is like it's been great to have a Moon or a Keith or the guys from Ribbit because they've made a bunch of great deals\nThey're like their way into their career. They're not so worried about every deal that they're paranoid. Right. And I think you have to be careful about who you bring into the cap table. Not just\n this isn't their make or break deal for their career.\n Totally.\n And you be careful who you bring into the cap table both in terms of, you know, quality of fund, but also who the partner is and what's the dynamic at at their uh place of employment too, right? Are there other partners breathing down their neck for performance because this is their make or break deal.\n And are you sniffing that out when you're figuring out who to raise from?\nonly because we learned it through the cycle, right? Um,\n you know, it's funny.\nRoom ribbon invested. They hadn't done a deal in a long time. It was the middle of fintech winter. And so when we were doing the series B, we got to know Nick Huber who led the deal and we got to know his partner Justin who took Nick's seat when he started his own fund. But we also met Nick Shayik over there. We also met Mickey Malik over there. And so, you know, that's great because they all underwrote the deal, right? And they're all bought into the success thereafter. And you have that like multi-art relationship which has been helpful.\n How brutal was that time that period of time between the A and the B?\nYeah.\n When everything was just getting absolutely destroyed to your earlier point, fishing in the wrong ponds.\nYou're like going after the wrong types of customers for your business. How brutal was that? Those voices in your head must not have been very nice to you.\n You know, we were lucky because we needed a little capital and our investors stood up, right? Like Mimoon stood up, right? And um like bridge rounds were were the the thing that kept you alive during that time and I remember like Mimoon and and Thrive stood up and they were there for us. Um so that was helpful and like it gave us a little breathing room.\n Y\n I still remember Moon saying like it feels like this dog can hunt. This is the money to prove it though because like you're kind of you're on your you're on your last breaths otherwise. Yeah. And what happened was we launched two partners that were both big relative to where we were and all the metrics just went like this. And luckily when that happened, we still had six or eight months of runway and we'd been in conversations with Ribbit for a while.\n The hard thing was it was the middle of my honeymoon and we're trying to raise the round and thankfully my wife gave us gave me like um enough time every day to have those conversations. We were in Italy. Um, and I still remember I got the cough call from our series B investors when we were like driving between two vineyards as I'd worked all morning and it was amazing, right? Like suddenly like weight is lifted at least for the next bottle of wine after that.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\nDid um do you like in those moments where you're like on your honeymoon\nYeah.\n you're like 6 months of runway is not a lot. Totally. Like that's like red alert, you know? Like that's close. You're not sure if you can raise. You're not sure what they're going to come back with. You have no idea.\n Yeah.\n And you're like in a very special life moment.\nTotally.\n Do you feel guilty in those moments? How do you process that happening? Like when you're waking up, do you wake up earlier? Do you try and get stuff done before your wife wakes up? Like, are you like, \"All right, I'm going to skip today.\" Like, you can't really skip a day. How does that work? I I'm fortunate that I have a my wife Lauren is incredibly um conditioned to this is probably the first one and then also very uh gracious about it most of the time.\n It's funny. We ra we we did our series A right around my wedding. We did our series B.\n Don't have kids.\n We did our series B. Wait a second. We did our series B as we were on our honeymoon. Uh we had one vacation planned last year and it was in the middle of closing the series C and you know it's most like we have a son coming in September and that's going to be a great time to raise series D.\nCongrats man.\n Thanks a lot.\n That's awesome.\n Thanks a lot.\n When you were living here as a broke kid in New York City. You moved from Ireland.\n I was I moved from Ireland to Chicago for a summer.\n Y\n at the time you know it's pouring rain here today. Uh, it was like this almost every day in Dublin, even though it's a great place to be. And it was also in the middle of the Great Recession and it hit Ireland really bad. And so when I went to Chicago for a summer, I was like, \"This is awesome. The weather's beautiful.\n Uh, you know, I got a job with a small law firm as a parallegal. They treated me super well and I just didn't want to go back. So I ended up staying from there. Went to Duke for a year and then moved to New York when I was 21.\"\n That was 10 years ago.\n No. Uh, unfortunately it was 14 years ago.\n 14 years ago. And when you're like 21 years old, living in New York City, it's both the most exciting and probably scary thing of your life, you know?\n Yeah.\n But you're like looking at all these highrises thinking like, I want to be on the 60th floor one day.\nTotally.\n But your reality is like, I'm sending Venmos to cover my rent check back and forth.\n Why did you choose to live in New York? Like you could have stayed in Chicago where the cost of living is easier.\n Yeah.\n And you wouldn't have been like literally monthtomonth.\nYeah. Well, New York was it was a choice because it was the only place I could practice law\n and so I didn't have a US JD and uh law degree and New York would let would let me take the bar and if I got a job I could become a lawyer here.\nAnd that was awesome because I was I was 22 or 21 at my first day at a law firm and everybody else was like 28 and I worked at a a great law firm that mostly fished in the Harvard pond. I remember how intimidated I was on day one to like turn up in a pretty cheap suit from Macy's and all these like kids who come out of Harvard and Yale. The nice thing was everybody was very nice to me, right? The only the only feedback I got early on was\n um clients would pay $400 an hour and I knew nothing. just I hadn't even passed the bar and they're still paying $400 an hour for my services and one of the partners said my accent was so thick they probably couldn't understand me and so I needed to like pull back a little on the Irish accent which was actually helpful feedback. I wish I still had more of it now today though. I feel like I should just stop.\nThat's awesome.\n Yeah. Can I ask you a few questions on kind of how you think about hiring the like where you are today versus where you want to be when you think about like okay right now you're probably maybe gone through I have no idea but wave one of executives and now it's like wave two of executives is that fair I don't I don't actually 100% and if you look at the leadership team today you know we've we've reconstituted it over the last year to set us up for the next you know from where we are today to a billion dollars of revenue when you were hiring leadership group one versus two, is there anything that has surprised you in what you want, what works well, what doesn't work well? Group one, when you're so early,\nyou\nthe thing that surprised me is you actually have to treat people the same all the way through in a certain way.\nAnd so group one, you just get lucky, right? Like who are these people that are silly enough to come and join us on this quest, which it's not even a business yet. And it's really important with those early joiners to treat them as co-founders effectively. It is our company. It is not my company. I might get to do these cool interviews and talk about it publicly and spike the football, but it is truly our company. And I think if you don't find people early on who buy that and you also give them that ownership, you're going to fail. Um because you can't be everywhere and you have to have people who are going to propagate that culture, they're almost certainly going to be more as much doers as executives early on.\nbecause I just you can't hire like managers of managers. It just doesn't work.\n What we've reconstituted the company, the thing I've noticed is the people like you get it wrong. I think somebody told me like one in two or one in three executive hires are going to fail at high growth companies. And we've certainly got it wrong once or twice.\nThe thing that's interesting is the people who uh stick and are have been successful now over the last few months and years as as part of wave two, as you put it, they have the same ownership mentality as group one. They might have more scale skill set. They might have, you know, operated at a higher level. They might have run teams of hundreds or thousands of people at bigger organizations, but they want to feel like they're co-founders just as much as group one. And that's actually been a trait then that I've been looking for in these people. Like, is this going to be their baby as much as it is mine? And that's been a huge learning for me along the way. Um, the diff the other difference between group one and two is just like the scale at which people operate. And I'm sure group two would have been great earlier on, but for sure there's some people in this group that wouldn't have been as effective as player coaches in group one.\n And on the like, let's just call it pride and ownership.\n\n\nYeah.\nHow do you know until they're in the seat?\nI think you can get a pretty good sense in the interview process by figuring out what makes people tick, right?\nLike you've asked a bunch of questions about me growing up.\nIt's really helpful to spend a lot of time with people, um, and kind of get to know what makes them tick.\nOne of the things I'll do is in the first or second interview with people, I actually will say, I just keep saying, \"Ask me all your questions.\"\nAnd it's helpful because I get to know what they care about because they reveal their preferences in the questions they're asking versus if I jump in and I start selling them on Imprint and asking them a bunch of questions, like it's too contrived versus I want you to just run out of things that matter to you and show me your preferences through all the questions you're going to ask.\nThe other thing I always do is like try and go and spend time with the person over dinner, over lunch, but in person is really important because you can kind of get past the barrier of an interview or a Zoom call and start to pick apart, like, you know, do you have children?\nWhat's your partner like?\nLike where did you grow up?\nAnd those things matter.\nAnd you talk, your podcast is called Grit.\nThat's how you start to figure out, like, does this person have grit?\nMhm.\nWhen you're like spending unstructured time with them, when do you feel like you have to sell?\nYeah.\nVersus when do you feel like you have to interview?\nDo you have a sequencing around that?\nSo the classic way I'll do it is the first question I'll say when we first meet, you know, we'll just small talk, I'll say, like, do you want me to, is it helpful for me to give you an overview of Imprint, right?\nAnd then I'll probably take 10 minutes and say, you know, here's my overview of Imprint, but then I want to really leave a ton of space for you to ask questions.\nAnd that way I've sold up front, but you probably have a sense of the company at this point because the people who care, and this is one of the things they're going to reveal early on, is they'll have listened to the podcasts, they'll have read the articles, they'll have downloaded the product, and now you're starting to get a sense of ownership, right?\nLike even though I'm the CFO or candidate for the CFO, I cared enough about product and all these other things to spend time up front.\nAnd so you're already starting to find stuff out.\nThen answering the questions is also how you're selling, right?\nSo, you're both understanding what they care about, but you're also, it's almost like you're playing poker and their deck is open.\nNot to say that it's that manipulative, but you can see the things they care about and then you can say, and I sometimes I actually will say, you know, the things you're looking for are not the things we're going to be able to give you because even though you might have a great resume, totally.\nIt's if it's going to fail, it's going to be such a drag, right?\nLike execs that fail, it's just such a drag on time and effort, um, and relationship building, and it hurts the team, too.\nAnd so you'd much rather both play with an open deck, so to speak, right, about what matters to you and what we can provide.\nUm, what's hard for me is I grew up in Ireland, and Ireland was coming out of like Catholic autocracy when I was in 1990 when I was born.\nEverybody in Ireland still went to mass, right?\nEverybody was Catholic.\nAnd the thing about the Catholic Church in Ireland was like it's super oppressive.\nAnd I find compared to Americans, like I really don't want to share.\nI like want to bottle up the emotions and I'm like not open, and Americans are just so open.\nUm, and what I find is like when I spend time with people now, what's helpful for them is when I start to talk about who I am, right?\nAnd where I come from and what makes me tick and what my insecurities are.\nAnd when you're going to spend that unstructured time with execs that are going to come join your team and who are in many cases going to be the people you spend the most time with under the most stress, revealing that to them helps them let their guard down and let them reveal themselves to you, too.\nMhm.\nThat's well said.\nDo you have your now wife meet them?\nI'm always ashamed to even talk about it.\nI was at WeWork for a hot second and you know, you watch the um, the WeWork documentary and people are always to me like, \"It couldn't have been that crazy.\"\nI'm like, \"No, twice as crazy as that in real life.\"\nLike they missed half the good stories and or more than half of the good stories, and it always felt a little cultish because there was so much of like I have to meet your partner and you have to meet my partner, and so I'm a little averse to that.\nInteresting.\nRight.\nUm, because Adam was always with his wife, and it, it, it was just weird.\nRight.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nAnd and I just find that's a little too, you know, like, like people used to say, like companies are families, and it's like, that's not true because, you know, I've had fights with my families and they should disown me and I haven't shown up for them and they should disown me, and like that's just not how companies run.\nTotally, right?\nLike we should have a community, we should care for each other, but we're not promising each other that we're like family, and so I just think some distance is a good and healthy thing, too, right?\nBut I'm always excited when somebody joins to spend time with them and their other part, their partner.\nLike I love when people are in New York and bringing them over to our place for dinner, for drinks before dinner.\nLike that's really nice because it, you start to be able to make relationships beyond.\nYeah.\nUm, beyond the person in front of you.\nHaving your spouse interview them just feels like it just feels like so far beyond the pale.\nTotally.\nRight.\nThat's a funny like allergy that you've developed though from.\nI have a lot of them, but that's one of the ones in particular.\nI don't actually care as much about the story of WeWork, but maybe more about the shame or guilt that you feel about it.\nWhy do you feel that way?\nLike you didn't know that it was going to like blow up, right?\nI feel like So, I was very close to Adam when I was there and I helped a lot with the fundraising.\nAt one point, Adam wanted me to be his chief of staff and I was like, I don't want to be your chief of staff.\nYeah.\nBut if you really want a chief of staff, my brother's an investment banker in New York in London and he'd love a new job.\nAnd then my brother became his chief of staff, right?\nSo like I was pretty close to a lot of it.\nAnd I look back and think, you know, the emperor wasn't wearing any clothes, but none of us were either, right?\nAnd it was a crazy time.\nIt was like pretty much Zer or it was Zerp.\nMoney wasn't was was everywhere.\nYou had these great logos that had invested like Benchmark in the series A, and can you imagine Benchmark investing in the series A of a property company ever again or having ever done that?\nMhm.\nAnd you had all this like validation, but like being sober today in 2025, like I feel like we were all making bad decisions.\nUm, and so I have shame around that cuz it feels like intellectually not rigorous and the opposite of who I think I am.\nRight.\nThere's like that personal narrative violation.\nThat makes sense.\nBut what an interesting learning.\nTotally.\nWas the comedown.\nWere you there?\nI got uh let go.\nI've never told this publicly.\nSo, right before the IPO got pulled.\nSo, we were working night and day on the IPO, there was probably a squad of like 25 of us.\nThat was my team, which was I don't know what you'd call it, like strategy, investor relations effectively.\nThere was the finance team, there was the legal team, and we'd been working non-stop over the summer on on the IPO.\nIt was clear the IPO wasn't going to happen.\nAnd I remember I went with Adam's the head of his family office to Adam's house and I said, \"Look, I don't think these IPO is going to happen.\nUm, I don't think the bankers have the stomach for it.\nI don't think the market's going to take it.\"\nAnd I think the board's probably going to move against you at this point.\nAnd Adam was like, \"You're crazy.\nGet out of here.\"\nAnd so I went home to my wife.\nThis is a Thursday.\nAnd I remember telling her, I was like, \"I think I just got fired.\nI'm not sure.\nI have dinner with friends tonight.\nI'm going to turn my phone off.\"\nAnd I went to have sushi with friends.\nAnd the boys were like, \"Let's go have a couple pints, especially if you just got fired.\"\nAnd I would turn my phone on walking between the sushi bar and the pub and Adam called me.\nHe's like, \"I think you're right.\nLike, can we like gather the troops?\"\nAnd I was just like, \"I'm probably done with this.\"\nI turned my phone off again.\nAnd Saturday came and there was a senior executive who used to work at Amazon and he called me and he said, \"What do you think's going to happen here?\"\nI said, \"Pretty certain we need to restructure the company.\"\nAnd he's like, \"Okay, I think I can be the CEO.\nCan you do you want to work with me on restructuring the company?\nCan you put a plan together?\"\nAnd he's like, \"Sure.\"\nSo, I start working on a plan and he calls me back and he goes, \"Can you send it to my Gmail?\"\nI was like, \"This is starting to get weird.\"\nAnd so, we put a plan together, uh, that's like this eight-page deck that I still have that was like, \"We're going to restructure the company and here's how we're going to do it.\nWe're going to sell all these noncore assets.\"\nAnd Monday morning rolls around and the exec Sebastian calls me and says, \"Okay, we're going to go meet the SoftBank board members.\"\nAnd show them the turnaround plan.\nSo, we go meet the SoftBank board members who show them the turnaround plan.\nWhat I didn't know was that there was a competing executive push from the CFO at the time for him to become the CEO.\nAnd Tuesday rolls around and I get a phone call from my friend who's the general counsel and he's like, \"Hey, they made co-CEOs and part of the agreement is they get rid of everybody who backed both of them over the weekend.\"\nI was like, \"Well, I didn't back anybody.\nI was just trying to help.\"\nAnd on Wednesday they were like, \"Hey, do you want, like, we don't think there's a home for you out here anymore.\nDo you want a severance package?\"\nAnd I was like, \"Please give me a severance package.\nI'm out of here.\"\nAnd then on Friday, I got engaged.\nCome on.\nSwear to God.\nCome on.\nYeah.\nWe had already planned, had a like a whole thing for my friends set up.\nSo my wife is totally conditioned to pull it full circle.\nWere you, uh, were you down in the dumps or were you relieved?\nUm, I think I was shell shocked.\nI don't think I had a full, I hadn't fully processed any of it.\nRight.\nAnd then I was fortunate because I had this severance package that gave me 6 months of pay and that's when I could start working on the Startup.\nAnd that's when you were ideulating on Imprint.\nIdeating on Imprint.\nYeah.\nSuper interesting.\nSo, is there anything maybe like in your personal life, like how you live, like the way you structure a day that has changed from D the lawyer to D at WeWork to D at series C or A Imprint to now?\nLike have you evolved in how you think about the way you literally spend a day in your calendar?\nTotally.\nI think when you're a lawyer, you're just very reactive and that was also true at WeWork cuz I was so close to Adam and he had no conception of time, right?\nSo like just totally reactive to how the day comes.\nUh, and similarly at Mackenzie, like you don't really own your day, like your client does.\nUm, you, I also didn't have, you know, a spouse wasn't expecting children, you know, it's just much easier to be reactive.\nI think now what I've learned is structure is important to me before I even get here because, you know, some days you wake up and you're just like not feeling great, right?\nAnd if if I turn up like that with that attitude at work, it propagates for everybody.\nAnd so I'll find that like getting up in the morning, going for a run, going for a workout, you know, spending 15 minutes with my wife and dog, and then as best I can walk to the office, like changes the whole complexion of the day.\nAnd then when you turn up, um, it's really about how we structure the week rather than how I structure a day.\nAnd trying to be very thoughtful about how the cadence of the week for the team goes and how we check in on the business on a, on a, on a Monday, exact team meets on a Tuesday, and then we can propagate that through the week has has helped a lot, right?\nAnd it it has meant that I can stop having the whole business in my own head and it forces me to like share more of it across the team.\nThat makes sense.\nIn this day and age, you were saying that not much keeps you up.\nIf there was the short list of things, what do those things look like now?\nIt's like it's not money.\nYeah.\nLike the company's not just going to like run out of money.\nWe hope not.\nFingers crossed.\nThat would be like a herculean effort to do that.\nTotally.\nWhat is it?\nWe're a fintech lending business, right?\nAnd we feel really good about being a fintech lending business.\n\n\nBecause you can look at companies like a firm or a new bank, and there's massive businesses to be built here because the lending is the profit pool for every bank, particularly credit cards. And that's great, right? And it's an awesome, huge TAM. You know, I, it would be hard to get the valuation of these AI companies, but I think we can have a company that's so big that will have valuation Y. Right? Our multiple won't be the same, but overall valuation can be the same.\n\nWe're also a lending business, though, right? And so the macro environment is something we have to worry about because things will get slightly worse as unemployment goes up or a recession comes around. That's kind of a good thing in a weird way for our business, too, because businesses like ours that have been tempered in the flame of a recession get a valuation boost on the other side, right? Nobody worries about Capital One now, 30 years in, that they don't know how to manage through a recession. In fact, you know, you'll see flight to Capital One as a recession comes because they really understand it. And so for us, first of all, like being set up well for whenever a session comes and then having to manage through that is probably the thing that keeps us as a leadership team most focused every day. And then the other thing is, you know, all the good that happens here is downstream of hiring really good people and keeping them happy. And I wake up most days thinking, how are we hiring really good people and keeping them happy, right? And, and you know, we are demanding, and we have a high bar, and we push really hard, but there must be a world where we could do that and keep those people happy and attract more really good people to deliver on all of the downstream things.\n\nOne more question on the AI front. The product is not an AI business. However, you're probably getting a lot of interesting efficiencies internally.\n\nTotally. You know, we were talking about hiring support people. There's probably a lot of juice that you can get enabling them.\n\nYep, with some of these new technologies. I also imagine that in a fintech business, there is a lot of leverage that you can get. I don't know. How do you think about that?\n\nSo, we couldn't agree more. If you look at at the end of next year, if we do our jobs medium well against our growth plan, we'll probably have like $250 million of cost in the business that should be massively lessened by deploying AI. And so one of the things we've done is we've taken a senior product manager and put engineers around that product manager and said that cost line item is your mission. And that's mostly in customer support, customer operations in our business. Like when you call in and you have a dispute, that's a pretty manual process to handle, um, and across risk. And in those three buckets, we think we can save hundreds of millions of dollars next year just through using AI. And that'll be a really important thing for us is we want to go public because we want to say, yeah, we make money like a credit card bank, but our whole P&L is optimized on top of our technology stack inclusive of AI. And so this is a much higher return on equity, you know, more profitable business. That should set us up for the future. And that's like one of the dividends of being able to build now. Like if you've been a company that's been around for 30 years, it's basically impossible to re-architecture yourself. We get to be on the forefront of this technology. And we're not an AI company, but we can be a company built on AI.\n\nYeah. Similar to like, I think it was Toby at Shopify's memo. Like every tech CEO has read that at this point. And now what they're doing at Duolingo. Similarly, are you taking it to that extreme, which is like, basically the point of the memo is prove to me before you hire somebody else that AI can't do this job. Basically.\n\nIn some ways, yes, in some ways, no. The no is it's more important for us right now as a company that's scaling this quickly that we deliver perfectly for our brand partners that have entrusted us with their relationships with customers and for those customers. And to be like pedantic about the marginal head when that's more important would be silly. And so we're not going to do that today. That being said, we are much more likely to approve additional headcount if they are engineers to support your scaling, totally, than if they are, you know, a person to do a manual process. We won't say no dogmatically. We'll have open ears, but we have this a similar mindset. I think, you know, Toby's business is amazing, and I hope to one day have a business as great as that, but they're also slowing down, right? And so they have the ability to look internally and and have a more dogmatic approach. Toby's an amazing leader, and I'm sure Shopify still feels somewhat like a startup. They're also just so big that you kind of have to get more dogmatic with people, too.\n\nTotally. So right now there's like this big hype curve around, oh, we're going to build $100 million companies with 20 people or whatever. And Parker at Ripling's counterpoint is always like, look, that sounds good in practice or in theory, but in practice what ends up happening is then you have a competitor. That competitor raises a bunch of money and hires like 10 times as many engineers and go to market people as you, and then you're going to go do that, like, or you're going to lose.\n\nTotally. What are you going to lose?\n\nSo I also think like, like sales is an interesting one.\n\nYeah. You know, yes, we will have a Gent AI making buying decisions for micro stuff, but are they going to be buying, you know, $100,000 ACV or $500,000 ACV enterprise software? Like the AI probably isn't going to be empowered to do that. And it's I find it unlikely that a human is going to want to buy from AI, too.\n\nYeah. Also, if you're telling me that you're going to have max 15 to 20 customers, I can basically guarantee you that you're never going to put some AI between you and the customer. Like, you're not going to send the AI Daragh to H-E-B Grocery Company, LP to like help you. Nobody wants another one of me. So, there won't be an AI me. But the way I would think about it, like the great thing for us is we have a four-person BD team to do this because it's hand to hand. That's wild and it's amazing leverage, right? And that's part of the reason we can have such efficiency on revenue per employee and we should be able to scale, right? Um, we go back to the AI thing. We're also a lower margin business so we have to be more cognizant of it than a an AI company.\n\nI'm thrilled that we got to do this, and I'm excited for what's next for you guys. Thanks a lot.\n\nAre you hiring?\n\nWe are definitely hiring. We're particularly interested in anybody in engineering who wants to come and build uh with us. We're opening an office in SF and uh we have a new CTO joining us there and we're hiring around that.\n\nEspecially when you hear the word grit, what comes to mind?\n\nWaking up every day and just keeping on trying. That's effectively how I think most companies get built is you just wake up every day and try and move the thing an inch forward, and it'll compound over five years and you'll turn back and you've moved it a long way. You know, doesn't feel like I got a ton achieved yesterday, but I'm sure I got enough done yesterday. If I put 50 yesterdays together, I'll feel really good in 50 days time. And I think that is the secret of building a company is you just got to wake up every day and and move it a little forward.\n\n[Music]\n\nThat's it for now.
