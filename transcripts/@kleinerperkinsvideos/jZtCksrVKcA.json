  "cleanText": "All the software we have today really have come about in the last 15 years. In 15 years, how many engineers built all that software? It's less than 1% of the world's population. Imagine what can happen when we double, triple, quadruple, 10x the number of people who can now create software through natural language. And that drives more demand for a software life cycle to quality. And that's where we're excited because if you think of what GitLab does, we're basically a full life cycle software engineering platform. I did live through the internet and the cloud and the social. But AI, I think it's not just about technology. It's about culture and work and life. It's going to change everything.\n\n[Music]\n\nWelcome to Grit. I'm Joubin, partner at Kleiner Perkins, a show where we go beyond the highlight reel and explore the personal and professional challenges of building history-making companies. Today, we're joined by Bill Staples, CEO of GitLab, a company in the DevSecOps space that's trusted by more than half of the Fortune 100. Bill stepped into the role just a few months ago, most recently as the CEO of New Relic and before that 30 years of experience across Microsoft, Adobe, and many others. We talk about Bill's journey stepping into a founder-led company, the challenges and the opportunities, and what comes next. Enjoy the episode.\n\nGitLab is one of the OGs of full remote. There are no offices. Not zero. So, I guess theoretically you could be wherever. Exactly. Yeah. Isn't that a beautiful thing? Uh, it's it's contrarian these days, isn't it? No. Well, I know there are some people who, you know, cherish the office and I do have to say like in-person meetings, there's a certain quality you get there that you can't get anywhere else. And so, you know, I do bring the team together and we do, you know, planning events and Well, I assume that's also why you travel, right? Like travel like you go and meet teams and customers, right? And there's just some that you can't get over Zoom. Yeah. I'm about to do earnings call at my CFO's house. So, yo, yeah. here. He's uh actually in on the East Coast. So, is this your first earnings? No, I've done one for GitLab already. Okay. You've already This is your second one. Yeah. Cool. I was public CFO their CEO before. So, I did but but but your first I meant your first earnings at GitLab. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was um GitLab is notorious for having basically everything about the company online. Mhm. Um, including quite a lot of details about each individual uh in the company, including you. And one of the quotes that I read that stuck with me on your profile uh was from George Bernard Shaw. And the quote is that I want to be thoroughly used up when I die. For the harder I work, the more I live. Yeah. Uh I was fascinated that that was a quote that you wanted to identify with.\n\nYeah. Makes sense now that we're talking about it. I found it last year while I was uh you know contemplating my next chapter realizing that this is Yeah, there's more to that quote. Did you read the whole thing? Actually, do you mind if I please? Cuz you know there's a lot there's a lot of meaning in that quote. Um okay, I'm ready. Are you ready?\n\nThis is the true joy in life. The being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. The being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown out on the scrap heap. The being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little cloud of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I'm of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it what I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die. For the harder I work, the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for a moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it over to future generations.\n\nWow.\n\nThat's uh I found that and I'm like I got to get back to work. That's what I that's what I'm here for. Yeah. Did you think that maybe you could find that purpose channeled elsewhere?\n\nYou know, could you make yourself useful and find hard work in avenues other than being a tech CEO? Probably. Yeah. I really you really can't um like I said like my life uh I've been super lucky. I think so much of success is actually luck and timing. And um I could never have predicted you know at each major step along the way what would have happened. And so I've kind of learned to just trust that process. Like I am who I am. I'm a pretty passionate committed person. I just you know I like to explore. or I like to learn, I like to try lots of different things and then when I see something, I know it and I go for it. And um so that that year was basically the process of um you know, really reflecting and contemplating what did I want next and I'd kind of looked at like four or five different paths um as possibilities on the full-time, you know, operator role. I said if something came along that I'm passionate about the mission that's number one uh non-negotiable. I don't work for money or for fame or for you know any anything like that. Like I want to devote myself to a cause. That was kind of number one. And I wanted to have impact on the world at the scale at which I've worked before. So public company in growth mode. those criteria were like super narrowing, constraining, right? Like there's probably a handful of companies or something that would have met that criteria, but I was like, that's that's what feels right. And if it doesn't come along, it doesn't come along. And you know like to be fair the reason that that criteria is so narrow is because if you're the founder CEO who is having a mission that they care about obviously if they started it they probably care about it at scale public company that's growing. Why would they leave? Yeah. You know, exactly. They're all usually still there. Exactly. It's usually around the time where the impact becomes less diluted or the company has stopped growing, right? Yeah. So, makes sense. So, I could never have predicted that GitLab uh would have the need that they had and and yet when it came along, it was like a perfect match. I've spent like almost 30 years building software for developers. developer tools and platforms. You know, what better mission? Um, I know the customer, I know the user, I know the, you know, use cases, I know the business model. Like, it's a perfect match. And Sid had the need. Sid was the founder. Sid's our founder. Yeah. Chair, exec chair now. And, uh, it was Sid's need, right? Like it came from from his from health issues, right? That he had to step away from the business. Yeah. Yeah. He had a recurrence of cancer last year and uh decided that was he needed to step down and get get that taken care of. When you feel this strongly about your work, I feel relatively strongly about my work. I always have. At times I have found that what feels demanding to others is me being passionate about my work. Does that make sense? Like uh you mean when you're passionate about your work, it has an impact on others. They feel it's too demanding or correct. Okay. And that I'm you know like if I'm all in and I'm it's like play to me. Mhm. And I'm doing it on the weekends and late at night and Mhm. I would just do my work if I wasn't getting paid for it. Mhm. Yeah. There's like uh I I have found that there can be ripple effects to that for sure. you know, like uh not everybody sometimes people just want to have this be their thing as a job. Yeah. And then they have, you know, a different part of their life. That's the rest of their life. Totally. Yeah. I don't feel that way.\n\nAnd sometimes I feel like I lack empathy for those that don't feel the way that I do. And certainly I think that if I'm asking for more or raising the bar of ambition uh like that creates wake in the organization. Uh have you experienced that? Oh yeah for sure. You know first I'd say um I don't h I don't have any judgment on that. I don't think work is the only important cause that someone can devote themselves to. And totally, you know, total respect for anyone who chooses something else as what they value and what they want to pour their passions and energy into. And someday that'll be me, too. You know, I I hope to live to 92 like my dad. And I I doubt I'll be doing a CEO. But if they work for you, do you want it to be their passion? Yeah. I want I I want to be part of winning teams. And to be part of a winning team just like in sports or you know um other types of activities requires hard work. It requires you know great um practice and devotion to the daily rituals. Uh and so yeah like I I have high standards high expectations for the people that I work I work with. Um, it's a it is a different level. I'd say uh I'm also able to separate it a little bit I will say in the CEO role versus any of the other roles I've ever played including like chief product officer you know technology officer in that um at least I experience the CEO role more as a calling more as a cause uh than a job in that like it the closest thing I can liken it to is being a dad um when you're a dad and you go on vacation if your kids are old enough to be on their own. It's not like you don't you don't think about them. It's not like you don't pick up the phone call if they call. Like you're always there for them. It's the same thing in the CEO role. I'm always there for the company 24/7, 365, doesn't matter. Um I don't count my hours. I manage my energy. So that means, you know, um if I'm feeling out of energy, you know, after a long day of meetings, I'll take a few hours and eat dinner with my wife and um try and recharge a little bit, but then I'll be right back at it Saturdays and Sundays. You know, when something something's always going on, I'm always engaged and committed. And I totally do not expect that from everyone. you know, that's not everyone feels that level of accountability to the company as a whole and nor should they. Um, so I'm able to separate a little bit those expectations from what I model and what I do. Um, but still very high standards. I mean, we want to be a winning team. We got high high expectations. What about your executives? Do you expect it from them? Uh, like I said, I'm able to separate myself from them, but definitely very high standards for executives. define high standards like what do you think of as high standards? First um I want to surround myself with a team of experts in their function who I can learn from. you know, I've become a pretty good generalist now, having been CEO for several years and um you know, certainly worked around those functions for my whole career, but uh I want people who can go 10 times deeper than I can in their function, who understand best practices, who understand how to measure and drive performance in that function, and who I'm constantly inspired by. So technically for their function, I want experts. But for me also it's really gone beyond that in terms of I want to surround myself with really great human beings. You know it's um having integrity having trust in a team is like the most important thing. uh if there's not trust, if there's not, you know, an ability to tackle the hard problems that come up inevitably in the business with trust and an ability to collaborate, you know, across them, uh you can't perform as a team. So when I, you know, when I hire people, um I'm looking for really good people first and technical experts second. Yeah, revisiting the um the point about an earnings like the earnings the earnings report and the day of let's just say like you were mentioning you don't manage by hours, you manage by energy. Like there's some days where I actually suspect there's a lot of days as the CEO where it doesn't matter what your energy level is. Like nobody else cares. The problem doesn't care. Wall Street doesn't care when you're giving an all hands presentation. The company doesn't care, you know. Yeah. And I don't know. I wonder like on those days, which is most days, frankly, what if the hours are there and the energy just isn't? Uh like I said, like I do my very best to manage it. So if I know for example earnings days a couple of days actually I don't know um if most listeners kind of have follow or understand or followed that process before but it's like you know you do the earnings call which is just the start of a very long process because then you do call backs with all of the analysts that cover your stock. We have like 35 or more right now. And then you do um second day of callbacks with all of the top investors in your stock. And these are like, you know, one to three or five people at a time um where they basically ask you all their questions as well. So it's like and it's back to back to back. Every 15 minutes you're booked with a new party for many hours at a time. Like when I know I'm up against that and I and I um preparing for that, I uh conserve energy and prepare for you know that marathon for basically 48 hours. Um so so you know that's all part of managing energy. You can't just go all out all the time. You got to, you know, what does the active conservation of energy look like? What does that mean? Make sure I'm getting, you know, eight plus hours of sleep. Yeah. Um, make sure I'm managing stress levels with, you know, exercise. Um, creative outlets. You know, I try to find ways of recreating, rekindling my creative energies. Photography is a big passion of mine. So, I'll, you know, do photography or cycling I love as well. also get on the bike and ride for you know couple hours. Uh come back from those feeling a lot more refreshed. It's a lot more mental and um emotional energy than it is you know physical requirement. Do you beat yourself up if you don't have the energy that you think you need constantly? I mean that's you know I push myself uh and have high standards\n\n\nand expectations for myself, above everyone else, and, con, I'm constantly falling short of where I wish I was.\nIs that true?\nYeah.\nSo, do you feel like you disappoint yourself more often than not?\nNo, I just like I take it, um, I don't think anyone's a per, you know, perfect, but, um, I like to, I like to aspire to be better tomorrow than I am today.\nAnd that is part of that growth journey, like constantly learning and improving is what I love.\nUm, you were saying before, I think, you know, you love getting in and problem-solving, and sometimes that passion isn't shared by those around you.\nI'm the same way, like, I, for me, problems are actually part of the fun, like, you know, being curious about, like, why is this happening?\nWhat can we do to mitigate it?\nWhat are all the, you know, different angles on it?\nUm, versus, you know, I know other people experience just like a stressful, there's a problem, and this is gonna blow up and cause all these issues, and, you know, for me, it's like, ah, I, I, sometimes I'm sure I, I don't act that way, but like, I, I like to go into and dive into those things, and for me, even if the problem is myself, like, I'm failing myself, uh, what I would love to do and how I would like to show up, it's like a chance to step back and say, okay, how can I do that better next time?\nWhat can I learn?\nHave you ever met anyone, Bill, that has this gene of anxious overachievement without the anxious?\nLike, have you ever met someone that's super ambitious, that is constantly raising the bar for themselves, that doesn't have the devil on their shoulder whispering that you're not doing enough, that was a bad meeting, you don't have enough energy?\nIt's hard to know because I think a lot of people maybe don't share that.\nBut I think most successful people, uh, that I know at least, are that way.\nUm, which way, you know, how you describe, I was striving to, like, you know, Satya, as an example, I was, I worked, I had a chance to work, um, pretty closely with Satya, still, uh, lucky to be, you know, in touch with him, and, you know, how he talks about growth mindset, like, it's a job never done, the minute you say, you know, something, you just shut yourself off from learning more, and I think he, he embodies that, he lives that, he doesn't just talk it.\nIt's like, uh, it's a funny existence that we put ourselves in, you know, like, uh, it's, uh, there's this weird byproduct that seems to come from it where it's both the most energy-giving and exhausting at, at the same time.\nIt's like that George Bernard Shaw quote, right?\nLike a brief candle, it's burning brightly right now.\nIt's yours to hold, but someday it's time to pass it on.\nLike, why not burn as brightly and like devote yourself to excellence as passionately as you can while you have the chance?\nThat's, that's my philosophy.\nAnd do you think you can do this like until, if amazing CEO jobs come around, till you're 80?\nYou think you, you think you can do that?\nI doubt, I doubt I'll last till 80.\nI, I don't know.\nYou know, like, um, why not?\nLike, what, what would prohibit you from lasting that long?\nI don't know.\nI just think, you know, it does require a lot of, um, stamina, you know, is draining mentally and emotionally, and at some point, I imagine that will, um, be a limiter for me, or maybe it'll be better for the company for a different CEO to take the reins, a different direction, or a different, you know, a different time.\nI mean, just think about the world we're living in right now and how rapidly things change with AI, you know, bringing amazing new products, uh, it seems like every day to market right now, things that we didn't even dream of a year ago are happening.\nSo, I can't, you know, I think it's another thing I've kind of learned in life is like to try not to, try to like look too far ahead and become too attached to an outcome that I have no idea if it can or will happen.\nI just have to live every day in the moment, be the best person I can be, and navigate with what comes.\nAnd if it lasts till I'm 80, I'll be grateful.\nIf it lasts another day, I'm grateful.\nYour career is littered with you riding these unbelievable technology shifts in companies that are like at the helms of them in many ways.\nLike it was at Microsoft for how long?\nLike, uh, 17 years from 99 to 2016.\nYeah.\nCrazy.\nAnd then you go to Adobe.\nYeah.\nAnd this was at the timeish when Adobe was transitioning to more of a SAS consumption, like their entire business model.\nYeah.\nAnd then you go to New Relic, which was a kind of a preeminent SAS company of the time.\nMhm.\nAnd now you're at GitLab, and I don't know, I'm not going to say definitively, but I'm pretty sure there's like 5 to 10 22-year-olds that are like looking at your company right now salivating about basically rearchitecting from the ground up an AI-native solution.\nUhhuh.\nAnd they'll probably do it pretty quick.\nYeah.\nYou know, relative to what it probably took to get this company to here now.\nI, I guess I'm curious, have you ever seen or felt anything like this before?\nIt was actually one of the reasons I, I wanted to come back to work at this time as well.\nYou know, as I was defining that criteria, I, I felt like this technology wave, I think, is the most exciting of all the ones before it.\nAnd you know, I did live through the internet and the cloud and the social, um, you know, client server, all those different technology waves in the last 30 years that were pretty exciting at the time, and, um, you know, amazing in their own right.\nBut AI, I think, is going to change the world.\nIt's not just about technology.\nIt's about culture and work and life.\nLike it's going to change everything.\nSo I wanted to be part of it, in particular for software engineers, because, you know, some of the best application, I think, of AI, and one of the, you know, killer use cases, if you will, I think, will be, um, software engineering.\nSo, uh, to be aligned with that mission is particularly exciting.\nI, I don't know if it's will be.\nI think it already is.\nI mean, there's a lot of great products coming to market.\nYeah, we were early investors of a company called, well, now called Windsurf, but formerly known as Codeium.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd congrats.\nThanks.\nIt's a great company.\nOpenAI.\nNow, the rumors are out.\nNothing has been officially announced, but the rumors are certainly out.\nAnd you know, I've never seen a company grow like this.\nAnd you look at other companies in the space.\nIt's not even just Windsurf.\nMhm.\nCursor.\nCursor.\nCopilot.\nCo-pilot, GitLab Duo, GitLab Duo.\nAnd it is such a good space because it's all structured, structured code that lends itself well to what these frontier models can do well, which is take these structured pieces of text and then spit out something predictive on the other end.\nYeah.\nCoupled with software engineering as a profession, which is a thing the world needs much more good ones of, you know, like it's the lifeblood of not just tech companies anymore, most companies, every company.\nYeah.\nAnd they're expensive, you know.\nUm, and so, I don't know, I, I, this, um, it was one of the early use cases through Copilot and Microsoft that took off, and I remember, I brought the, uh, CEO of GitHub at the time to come speak to this group of CIOS, and this was like not even two years ago.\nAnd it was like the, it was the game in town, growing like 50 plus percent on a gigantic base.\nAnd I remember thinking, boy, like Microsoft and and GitHub might just like run away with this market.\nAnd there was insatiable demand from every company to have a co-pilot for their engineers.\nThen Windsurf's, formerly known as Codeium Slides, were all us versus Co-Pilot.\nMhm.\nAnd you fast forward not even 18 months, and what I thought was a big market is like the mother of all markets right now.\nMhm.\nAnd what I thought was maybe the company, the incumbent at the time that was going to mop up the floor of this gigantic market, you could argue is in like not even the top three right now.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI think it just says we're in early days still.\nThis is still early, early innings.\nIt's insane.\nAnd it's going to change the world.\nI mean, literally, it's because, like you said, every, every company is in some way a software company.\nThey usually use software to either grow their revenues, engage their customers, or they use software to run their company, you know, and automate processes and take care of, um, systems.\nAnd so no matter which kind of company they're, maybe they're both, uh, software is going to be completely, you know, transformative.\nUm, I, I often remind myself, you know, like growing up on the farm, there was no cell phone, you know, cell phone, there was no smartphone, there was no cloud, there was no apps, there was no social media, there was nothing, you know, this is 50 years ago, less than 50 years ago, and all the software we have today, all those connected devices really have come about in the last 15 years, right?\nIn 15 years, and how many engineers built all that software?\nIt's less than 1% of the world's population.\nIt's a fraction of 1% of the world's population.\nImagine what can happen when we double, triple, quadruple, 10x the number of people who can now create software through natural language.\nI, I don't even think we can understand what that looks like, the world that that is.\nAnd it's, um, you know, I think people who are maybe not as familiar with the process of building software and, um, you know, the challenges of it, might assume quickly, oh, that means there won't be many software developers because machines will be building it all, like, no, actually, I think just like, you know, when the internet first came about, it was super expensive, and there was limited connectivity, the more we've invested in infrastructure and made, you know, the internet pervasive, the faster, faster it's grown, the more it's used, the more applications are on it.\nSame thing with, you know, airplanes.\nUh, when they first came out, they were super luxury, you know, for very small number of cities.\nThe more we've invested and grown the number of, you know, uh, airways and airlines, the cheaper they've gotten and the more people travel.\nSame thing with code, I believe, you know, it's such tedious work today.\nLike, you have to get the syntax perfectly right or the code doesn't work, or it has security and other issues, and it's just so incredibly tedious that most people can't do it, literally, like, it's technically so difficult.\nAnd if we can use machines to actually create and manage that complexity or help us do that, the prize for like human judgment on, um, both, you know, the design, the architecture, and the software itself is actually going to become even more valuable, and we're going to be much more rapid at innovating and creating software solutions where today, like cost and resource and time, just like it doesn't, it doesn't allow for software to be part of that solution.\nTomorrow it can be.\nI wonder, like, an open question in my mind, standing here today, maybe we'll, let's revisit this in 12 months when we sit down again and talk, because God knows the world's going to be quite different.\nYeah.\nYou're talking about the total TAM of software engineers should increase by a lot.\nPeople that could traditionally not write software will be able to write software in natural language and just tell the machines to go build something that they otherwise would have to use a programming language to do.\nYep.\nSo that's like one thing.\nOkay.\nYou could argue, and I'm curious to hear your take, like, well, then are more people gonna be just building more shitty software?\nOkay.\nLike school of thought number one.\nI don't know.\nNumber two is this technology, I think the reality is, in software engineering, there's a fraction of the people that are delivering a majority of the value.\nRight?\nSo your top 10%, 5% of software engineers are doing 90% or more of the value creation.\nUhhuh.\nIn engineering.\nThose 10x engineers.\nExactly.\nRight.\nWhich is why we're all looking for them.\nUhhuh.\nSo like, are they going to become, are we going to create more 10x engineers?\nYeah.\nAnd are the 10x engineers going to be 100x engineers?\nIt's like school of thought number two.\nAnd then the third, which is if you go talk to Sam at OpenAI or Dario at Anthropic, they're going to say, &quot;Well, don't worry.&quot;\nLike, neither of those questions matter because this, these models are going to get so good that this idea of like good or bad software engine is just going to be the AI writing the software, you know.\nUm, I'm, I would, I would love to hear your reaction to that.\nYeah.\nUh, well, let's start with the first one.\nI think, you know, will there be more people creating crappy software?\nThe answer is, um, I think yes.\nUh, and that's actually part of what I'm so excited about with GitLab, right?\nBecause if you think of what GitLab does, um, we're basically a full life cycle software engineering platform.\nSo everything from people planning and tracking issues through obviously their code versioning and control, their, you know, packaging, building, deploying software, the securing of that software, the compliance standards, the quality, you know, testing and validation, like all of that, it's what we do.\nAnd so while AI right now is making huge waves in the software creation process, primarily in the IDE, you know, the tool that most developers use to off to author the software, that's the Windsurfs and the Cursors and the co-pilots.\nUm, all that software, in order to actually get deployed into production and actually reach the end user, has to go through a software life cycle.\nLike it has to, it has to be version controlled.\nIt has to be tested.\nIt has to be security checked.\nLike the things we do are still very relevant.\nIn fact, I would argue even more relevant, um, if the bar of simplicity is going to go up on creating and authoring code, and enterprises who, you know, rely on GitLab to secure it and make sure it's compliant and meets all of their safeguards, like the demand, I think, is only going to increase.\nAnd so then I shift to like, what can AI do for all of those processes?\nHow can we make, you know, the full life cycle of software engineering AI driven?\nUm, because, you know, when we study where engineers spend time, it's only like a quarter of the time that they're actually authoring code.\nThe rest of is all that other stuff, and, uh, it's even less fun than authoring code.\nI just put it that way.\nSo even more beneficial for them to be able to delegate mundane tasks, tedious things to an agent who can go do work on their behalf.\nUm, so more people writing crappy code.\nYes.\nAnd that drives more\n\n\nDemand for a software life cycle to quality and secure and assess that, and um, that's where we're excited. You know, I think to the 10x engineer um question, that's absolutely what we're like when I think of what our um Asian platform should do. It should make more 10x engineers. And for those, you know, gifted 10x engineers today, it should make them even better.\n\nUm, and uh, you know, you can imagine a world where as a software engineer, you know, you're assigned a set of bugs um in the code, and you've got to check out those, you know, issues one at a time. Check out the code, look at the code, debug, analyze what's going on, come up with a fix. Um, and you do that one issue at a time. And sometimes an issue can take days, days and days to debug. Imagine a world where as an engineer you can instance an agent. In fact, you can instance 10 agents. You can parallelize the debugging and code fixing for 10 issues at a time on the same day in parallel. You can have those agents go do all the tedious checking of the code and looking for issues. They have all the context uh of issues that have been filed against this code block, security scans that have been run, test passes that have been made, you know, previous deployments, errors in production. They can pull all that context in without you having to do it manually and assess the code to look for, you know, the potential coding error and then come back to you and say, \"Well, here's what I found stitching all that context together. Here's what I think the code error is. Here's a code suggestion for how to fix it. Um, does it look right to you, human?\" And I as an engineer can paralyze that across 10 issues. Can review the work of all the agents, and when I feel good about it, say go ahead, merge that um, you know, code change. That's like, that's so empowering for engineers. Like you would take what's super tedious and a lot of toil and you'd create something that like can elevate their impact in a significant way. That's what we're building. And what about option three? I think, you know, good is always in the eye of the beholder. And so what's good today, you know, most of the time for software is good enough is what it really means. Like every software uh, every software project I've been part of has bugs. Um, it's just a matter of finding them and how bad they are. Every software project has usability issues. Uh, you know, you try to design them perfectly and get them just right, but there's always corner cases and problems. Um, not every software project I've worked on is beautiful and elegant and amazing. Um, it requires really skilled, you know, designers to do that. And I think uh, over time certainly AI will get better at those things. But I think that just means the bar is going to go up. Like the standard of what we expect from software in terms of quality of design, quality of experience, quality of outcomes is just going to keep going up and up. And I don't think we're anywhere near exhausting the demand for software and the demand for high-quality outcomes from our software. And so I, I don't think this is a anytime soon kind of we're at the limits of what software can do. And when you say agents, I hear a lot of different definitions these days for what people think of as agents. How do you think of it?\n\nI think of it as um, an AI-driven process that uh, is specialized in particular skills. So uh, you you build an agent uh, typically focused on a particular domain and and uh, give it the appropriate context to go exercise those skills and execute particular tasks with those skills. And then, you know, um, you can agents can obviously talk to each other and you know, work with each other, share those skills, and then interact with humans to get input or prompt, you know, more prompt on the particular task they're executing internally at GitLab today. Have you put part of the team on like, all right, what's our story here? How are we going to work on this? Who's building the agents? How much are we spending on that? Like, oh yeah. Have you had to like kind of Oh, it's one of our biggest investments right now, actually. Yeah. Super awesome work going on. I see that a lot of uh, these tech companies that have been been that were born pre our modern definition of of AI um, since the transformer. I'm curious, like, doesn't everybody want to be working on that? My observation is that many of these types of companies that have been around for a while are all scrambling to either integrate the technology into their product or internally, right? But you know, on the product side, I have seen so many people that are like, oh, the core stuff is boring. I don't care that it drives most of our revenue. Like, I want to go work on the cutting edge. Yeah. I see how much these AI folks are making. I hear you, Bill, on your earnings report using the word agent and all these things. Like, I want to be a part of that. Like, you're telling me that's the future. Like, why, why, why wouldn't I want to work on the future? Like, does it, does, does it create any of that tension in the company? You know, I, I actually think that would be an awesome thing. Um, the more people who want to explore AI uh, and make it part of our platform, I think the better. Obviously, we have other things that we're investing in and doing. You know, one of the things that's helped GitLab grow in recent years is our security capabilities. You know, SAS and DAST and dependency analysis and container scanning. And we do, you know, a lot to help our enterprise customers um, ensure that they're, you know, securing their uh, their software and their company and their customer data. And um, it's uh, it takes a specialized skill set to be good. You know, for example, the code scanners um, often require people who are experts in a particular language that know, you know, what kinds of vulnerability patterns exist in particular languages. And so, you know, you imagine if you're that kind of expert, um, you your your skills are prized, you have a a place to contribute at GitLab. Obviously, you're probably hired to do that. And there's always more work we can do to make those scanners to make our security uh, capabilities themselves better. And they're working on that. But uh, you can also imagine a world where AI could help with some of that pattern recognition on security flaws. You know, vulnerability detection, remediation. And so it's a chance for them both to continue to contribute, but also think about new approaches to security that are AI-driven. And um, you know, to some extent, same thing's true of core DevOps capabilities like CI/CD, you know, the ability to integrate code package and deploy it um, is 10, 10 years old, um, and you know, there's opportunity to rethink like what role should AI play in that. And so every team um, has a set of priorities, sometimes those are like core quality, sometimes those are enhanced features for human engineering ers that we currently serve. And sometimes that's like, let's think through how can an agent help with these use cases so that the human engineer and the agent can work together, collaborate to get this done more, more quickly. This company's like a $10 billion market cap and you know, you've been a fancy executive for a long time. You were sure the chief product officer at New Relic before, like you come from a product and technology background before becoming the CEO. But I wonder, like, do you get insecure about the technology? Like people that are in the technology often tell me like how they feel like they're really struggling to keep up and they're in it every day. They're not like managing people and companies and earnings reports and all these things, you know, like uh, how do you feel about keeping up?\n\nI have never seen the pace this high on innovation. It is hard to keep up. Um, again, why I'm really grateful for experts around me that are more dedicated to a particular function and in this case, you know, product and engineering um, experts that can go deep and understand every single day the next thing that's coming out and new approaches. So um, I learn a lot from them and I study a lot myself just to try and keep up, study how, read and watch lots of uh, you know, videos and podcasts. I, I'm in the middle of one right now. They're just dense. Like uh, like it's amazing. And if you were to relist to some of these like six months ago, they're like almost irrelevant and half the time completely wrong because someone's talking their own book about something that ended up not panning out. I have found myself carving out 30 to 45 minutes every day, whether it's at night or just during work. Yeah. To get into these LLMs. Like I'll just live in ChatGPT to just like feel the contours of the technology and the limits of what I'm bumping into. Mhm. And what's working and what's not. And I haven't found another more effective way yet. I'm curious if maybe, maybe I should go to reading, but to like feel this thing, you know, to like feel what these things are doing. Yeah. And where their heads go, you know, and what happens when I shift models, even a model in OpenAI, let alone across different models, and yeah, it's fascinating. It is interesting to see the different kind of personalities and the different approaches. I think I have Perplexity, Claude, um, obviously ChatGPT, xAI Grok, I think I have them all on my phone. Sometimes when I don't like an answer, I'll go to another one and I'll get, you know, get a better answer. Actually, it's super interesting to see and they evolve every time there's a new model, you know, there's there's like a different experience um, subtly and sometimes more dramatically. Uh, it is super fascinating. I'm curious, like, as a guy who asked lots of questions uh, as part of your job, do you ever turn it around and have the, you know, the AI ask you questions? One of the best prompts that I have seen that I stole from, I think it was Toby at Shopify. Do you know what I'm talking about? It was uh, I read his memo recently, but not, I think it was Toby from Shopify. I hope I'm not. The prompt was basically, knowing everything you know about me. Oh, don't be shy, like what do you think would surprise me about myself? And it was a very scary deep answer. Really very scary deep. Well, it probably also has the context of all the things you say in these podcasts, right? Yeah. Well, I fed it all of the transcripts and everything, but also with memory. Yeah. That's been introduced not that long ago. Not even memory within a chat, but memory within the system. Yep. Um, it has everything that I've ever asked it. It has all the context on something. Yeah. And so then I start to ask it questions based on on the memory. And yeah, sometimes the answers are like freaky. Yeah. You know, I have told in this case ChatGPT, like never [Â __Â ] me. Like I always want pander to me. Yep. I always want you to be very direct. And now before it gives me an answer to something, it says no BS or to be blunt with you, you know, like it just it just knows. Y, which is funny. Isn't that amazing? I think the best advice I've seen is like stop treating it like a tool and treat it like a collaborator. Yeah. Right. Like you somebody you want you want to have as a lifelong collaborator. And so like giving it prompts like Yeah. Don't don't BS me. um, really help it like better, better collaborate with you to better interact. Right. But but don't you think like uh, to your uh, to your point, Bill, about you going across these different LLMs like Perplexity and Anthropic and OpenAI and Grok. Maybe we're just in a moment in time now, but a founder, a Kleiner Perkins founder recently said this to me, like with memory, and he's in OpenAI, ChatGPT has become the stickiest piece of software I've ever used in my life, and it might be the stickiest piece of software like in history. Mhm. Because it has so much context. Yeah. That now if I think about like I have gotten some dissatisfying answers recently. I'm going like to do some deep work about like some health things that I'm working on. I just been kind of annoyed by some of the answers. I feel a little bit stuck because I can't port that memory into Anthropic. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like it becomes like a proxy for a person, a relationship, right? Like would you ever dismiss a relationship that was valuable to you? Exactly. Which is also why now, interestingly, consensus view in Silicon Valley today is that, you know, maybe OpenAI is going to run away with this thing because they have the lead, and when you have the lead, even if it's incremental, it's tough to switch out if you've invested all of this kind of like time in getting it, getting to know you. I don't know, I think it's still early days. I do think memory is a, you know, an awesome, an awesome uh, new capability, and um, you know, we're excited uh, at GitLab to incorporate memory into our agent interactions because, you know, so much of software engineering, again, it's like learning through experience and iteration, and like you'll go fix a bug, and then you'll get code reviewed, somebody else or a machine will look at it and realize, oh, you missed this or you got that wrong, and that's a learning moment. The same thing happens for agents. You know, they take a crack at a problem, and a human looks at it and says, \"No, no, no, no. I want, you know, this changed or that changed.\" And today, the LLM itself doesn't learn from that, right? It's trained uh, elsewhere. But if you build memory into the service and it remembers that interaction and it reflects on that interaction, then the next time it makes a bug fix, it can remember, oh, I got that part wrong. Did I, did I get it wrong this time? But is that actually working well enough where you were like you would say go ship that in production because my experience, again, just like this is kind of simple, Joubin, playing around with this software, is that even the way that I, like if I give it a bunch of transcripts for the podcast, I have to be quite specific today with the things that I want it to remember. It doesn't just remember everything. I have to say, okay, make sure you remember the titles of all of the guests because that's who it is and the sequencing of when it was. If I have time sequencing questions of something before 2022 and after, um, or um, if I want to ask about, if I want to query around like tonality, right, I have to make sure that I tell it to memorize. It's not, it's still not.\n\n\nI would certainly not ship anything like this if I had customers that were counting on it.\nWe're not there yet.\nYeah.\nSee, that's that's that's why um I think we're still in early days.\nChatGPT and all the other tools like it are awesome and they're uh you know powered by the latest LLMs as they as they uh get updated and they're getting new features like memory.\nBut this use case that I was just describing around um you know reflection and learning uh can be somewhat domain specific.\nSo for you, you're trying to like give it the specific prompts to say, hey, I need to remember guest and title and these things because ChatGPT as an application doesn't understand that you know that data format out of the box.\nYou have to give it that and the same thing is true of software engineering like we use those same LLMs to power you know GitLab Duo, but we have to build the specific um you know use cases like memory and reflection on code reviews in order to give it that context in order for it to then apply it the next iter the next interaction and so that that's all that's the work that we're doing that's the work every every company has to do on top of the LMS in order to make it domain specific for a given task.\nYeah.\nOkay, agreed.\nBut can I pull that thread a little bit further and and explore this with you then?\nAre we going to have domain specific everything?\nYeah, I mean I think that's of course there's there's a knowledge base.\nThere's a level of competency that LLMs are uh growing at all the time, but the application of that knowledge um I think is really important and often domain specific.\nAnd so that's the opportunity for so many of the applications, you know, that exist today.\nBy embracing AI, you get a super smart, you know, competent intelligent intelligence, but then you have to figure out how to apply it for a given domain.\nAnd um unless you know, unless the OpenAIs and anthropics of the world go build every application.\nYeah.\nAnd so, you know, I think that is the opportunity at the application layer that so many of us are pursuing because we have the data, we have the context, we have the human interaction today.\nAnd by infusing AI and bring agents to the to the table, we can power our users even more specifically than just a generic LLM can through ChatGPT.\nAnd when stakeholders like let's just say you think analysts are some of the investors are some of the smartest folks that you know.\nMhm.\nBut like these investors, I mean no disrespect, have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to like the future of these technologies.\nAnd I guarantee you, I haven't listened into your last earnings report, but there's probably some pretty big questions about how are you thinking about agents and AI stuff like h how you know like how do you reconcile that?\nYeah, they're super smart at what they do, which is, you know, they study companies and look at the numbers very deeply.\nThey look at the um, you know, competitive market.\nThey look at they go interview customers and understand what customers are saying about you, understand even what you know team members or employees in the company or those who've left say about the company and and how it's doing.\nAnd so they're very good at all of that and and then making judgments on like, you know, what do we recommend, what do we invest in, you know, how do we do our business?\nThey're not obviously they're not innovators.\nThey don't purport to be.\nThey don't know where technology is going.\nSo, they're doing that those calculations based on the information they gather.\nAnd that's what I find super um super engaging because they they know a lot about the business and the company and what's going on around us.\nUm and that interaction is what I what I find so exciting.\nYeah, fair enough.\nI don't I don't look to them for technology.\nYeah, fair enough.\nFair enough.\nI'm curious maybe on a more personal note, how do you organize your days before you were in an office, right?\nLike now you're not in an office.\nI'm just curious, how do you think about structuring a day, a week, a month?\nYeah.\nTo-do lists, goals, like h how do you organize your time?\nOne of the most um helpful I think leadership uh lessons I've learned uh is to create a create an operating system basically for myself and how I um how I lead how I run the company.\nAnd so it's pretty structured.\nUm I have you know um basically all starts with people like make sure I'm surrounding myself constantly by the right set of people like we talked about before great human beings with integrity high trust and excellence at their domain and then it and and latter up from that is like strategy.\nWhat is our vision?\nWhat is our you know approach to this business in order to create long-term customer value and therefore investor you yeah return and then it goes to process like what is the process by which I can measure the progress every single week of the business and that cadence is I found super important um you know previously I've had like a quarterly cadence because quarter quarterly boundaries are important for public companies especially.\nBut like when I have a quarterly cadence of setting priorities and inspecting, it's just not especially in the pace of the world today is not frequent enough.\nWhen you set a quarter priority, it's you check in the first month and everyone's like, &quot;Yay, we're on track.\nThis is such an awesome priority.\nWe're going to nail this one.&quot;\nSecond month, you check in.\nOh, we're off track a little bit.\nWe're not sure we're going to make it.\nYou know, some of this stuff might slip.\nSome of this stuff's not working out.\nAnd then the third month it's like oh shoot we we failed you know we got some of the stuff done but most of it didn't get done like that is the rhythm that is the typical pattern and so um I move to a weekly cadence now so every day of my week is planned and what I do is I take the priorities of the company and break them down into basically um initiatives with key results that we expect to drive.\nUm and um I check in with each of those about 15 of them every single week to understand where we are, what progress we've made since last week and um how things are, you know, how things are working out.\nSuper important because um I I you know I think staying in the details of things and understanding as things evolve um if there's context the team needs if there's coaching they need if um you know things are surprising them that you should be aware of so you're not swooping in with like low context when things are blowing up and saying oh you're incompetent or you know this is totally screwed up and you know let's let's go change direction another time.\nUm, it's so important like no, you know, no one wants that from a from a from a leader, especially a CEO.\nSo, that's how I kind of stay in touch and every single day of my week is planned with those operating check-ins um across the key initiatives of the company.\nUm I try and spend you know uh several weeks in the quarter as well with customers um because I feel like that constant feedback and interaction with customers just keeps me um with that customer mindset and speaking like the voice of the customer both to the team and to the investor community.\nUh so that's something I I try and prioritize every every quarter as well.\nUm and then you know like I said I manage my energy so uh uh looks different uh in terms of the unstructured time every day.\nSometimes it'll be you know going deep on writing a piece of um you know content for the for the external or internal audiences or sometimes it means you know reading a bunch of things and getting getting sharper.\nSo your energy management is unstructured.\nYeah.\nWell, I'm constantly managing energy in the Well, I guess by design because you have to flex to what your energy is or isn't.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, I I try and create enough energy every day to do the structured work and then when there's unstructured time, I decide, do I need a nap?\nDo I need to eat?\nDo I, you know, have the energy to go going on something else?\nDo you block off time for dinner with with your wife?\nYeah.\nEvery day.\nEvery day.\nBlocked.\nYep.\nWhat time?\n6 o'clock for an hour.\nMinimum an hour.\nI try to make it to That's nice.\nYeah.\nPhones away.\nThat's my one of my bad habits.\nMy wife always gives me a The phone's there.\nI try to keep it away, but like it's such a It's a terrible habit, isn't it?\nYeah.\nI don't know.\nI don't know if you struggle with that.\nUh but yeah, I have just been like a do not disturb monster recently where I became so attached to the buzzing in my pocket that it forget about like you know dinner with my partner or whatever like it was constantly interrupting everything.\nYeah.\nAnd so I've gone full do not disturb for hours hours on end.\nIt's been really helpful and certainly at dinner I try and I'm a pretty efficient eater.\nSome would say I maybe a little too efficient.\nUh uh but I try and keep my phone away for those good for you 30 45 minutes.\nI got to do better.\nJust just for peace of mind.\nYeah.\nAnd then you go back to work.\nYeah.\nUsually like 8:00.\nYeah.\n7:30 8.\nYep.\nAnd then are you like uh do you stay up late?\nNo, actually I usually try to um I usually try to go to sleep early because then I wake up early.\nIt does depend.\nUh like 10:00 p.m.\nI like to try to sleep.\nYeah.\nAnd then usually up um sometimes as early as 3, sometimes 5.\nYeah.\nSix.\nThe latest.\nDepends on if I'm up working in the night.\nYou know, if I've got the energy, I'll I'll work at midnight or three.\nIn fact, one of my teams from 20 years ago, it's funny, just uh texted me the other day, um I can't remember what exactly what we were chatting about, but they're like, &quot;We were just talking about you and your 3 a.m. emails and how much we miss them.&quot;\nThat was like 20 years ago.\nLike still, uh you still do that?\nStill do it when I uh Yeah.\nWhen I've got something I'm, you know, passionate about.\nAnd then you'll just adjust your hours to later if you're up till 3.\nYeah.\nOr you'll just bear through it.\nI I manage the energy.\nSo yeah, yeah, if I if I'm not feeling like I can bring myself to the game, I'll take a nap in the middle of the day or um you know, go to bed earlier that night.\nYeah, there's really not too many rules for you as as it relates to energy management.\nI mean, I'm just Yeah, I've committed my life at this, you know, at this point to the to the company and uh um I love what I do and so I do as much as it as I can.\nHow much do you eat?\nDo you eat every meal?\nUh, I the worst part is being on the road traveling because then you're usually doing dinners with customers or team or whatever.\nUm, and the hours in restaurants are always different.\nUh, when I'm working at home, I uh try to have good breakfast, um, moderate lunch and then dinner with Jolly, but it's usually pretty light on the breakfast and lunch.\nIt's tough on the road.\nIt is really hard.\nIt's tough on the road.\nIt is.\nYeah.\nThat and the sleep too.\nSleeping in a different bed every night.\nSleeping is way worse actually, I think, than eating because eating you can at least just order what you want from the menu.\nYeah.\nWell, when you're your age and you can eat about anything and not gain weight.\nThat's true.\nTrue.\nIt's so hard to eat healthy now.\nAnd finding a way to like get a sweat in.\nYeah.\nExercise is also tough.\nMy my experience has been that when I'm traveling, I I can't tell if I don't sleep well because I'm in a bed and that environment, the temperature I like get cold.\nI can't get cold enough in the room or if it's because when I'm traveling, my mind is so in work.\nLike I have no time with my partner for dinner or whatever.\nLike I'm just it's all work.\nAnd then I go home to the hotel and usually I've been in meetings all I go back to I'm in meetings all day.\nSo you're catching up on email.\nCatching up on email, right?\nLike in bed, which I I rarely do.\nYeah.\nAnd so then my brain just keeps going.\nSo I don't know if it's uh if it's if it's mental or physical.\nIt's both, I think.\nBut and it's compounded worse.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt's that's why you just got to work so hard that you're exhausted and sleep.\nThat's right.\nThat's right.\nYeah.\nI appreciate you doing this.\nYeah.\nMy pleasure.\nReally fun.\nReally fun.\nI'm excited to see like your, you know, you're a few months in.\nFew months.\nNo, six months.\nUh, yeah.\nDecember 5th.\nSo, we're coming up.\nYeah.\nSix months.\nWell, I'm excited to see how the next the next few quarters and and years go.\nThank you.\nReally exciting.\nThank you.\nUm, are you hiring?\nOf course.\nWhat are you hiring for?\nEverything.\nAnd hiring anywhere.\nYeah.\nThat's the beautiful thing.\nI think we have uh team members in 65 countries right now.\nThat's wild.\nAnd no offices.\nSo, everyone's working.\nUh yeah.\nWhen you hear the word grit, what do you think of?\nI think it's uh becoming comfortable with uncomfortable things so you can take on hard problems.\nI think for me as well, like what I aspire to do is that with a smile and make it look easy.\nI'm still working on that because uh you know, I think to to accomplish great things, you got to tackle hard problems.\nSometimes I forget to smile.\nSo, I'm working on that part.\nI love that.\nThose kind of people inspire me.\nBill, thank you.\nThat's it for now.\nIf you like the episode, please leave us a review or go back into the archives where we've done more than 200 episodes with some fantastic folks.\nThis podcast is a Kleiner Perkins production and I'm Joubin.\nThanks for listening.\n[Music]\n",
