You Should Know.\nThe Invincible Duo.\nThe ambiguously gay duo.\nYes, sir.\nYou are correct.\nThat was pretty good.\nI love it when there's like a an impression of an impression.\nThat's all I do.\nIt's true.\nThat's my specialty.\nBut you do it so well.\nYeah, that was that bit was uh obviously Phil the great Phil Hartman, the late great uh Phil Hartman's Ed McMahon.\nAnd that was a uh that was something that in college and you know my college years were generally the Phil Hartman years on SNL.\nMhm.\nMy good friend Eddie and I, you know Eddie, we uh for some reason that one really and still to this day, one of us will say something and the other will go, \"Yes, sir.\"\nYeah.\nI mean, it's timeless for sure.\nYeah.\nReally stuck with us.\nI'm sure there's even people walking around doing that who have no idea who Ed McMahon is.\nYeah, probably.\nThere's at least two.\nThat's what I'm putting money on.\nYou and someone else.\nI know who Ed McMahon is.\nI'm not a fully realized person.\nI know.\nI'm joking.\nUm, we're not talking about Ed McMahon, though.\nNot really.\nWe're talking about the first guy you mentioned you were doing an impression of, Phil Hartman, who turns out to be a pretty great, complicated, tragic, ultimately dude.\nYeah.\nUh, you know, actor and comedian, uh, known best for his work on probably Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons.\nMhm.\nUh and Dave helped us with this and he wanted us to shout out uh a book by Mike Thomas called You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman with one N even though he was born with two N's under the name Hartman.\nRight.\nYeah.\nI thought that was pretty um pretty crazy.\nHe dropped the second N.\nYeah.\nFor his his um I guess stage name.\nIt looks like a typo.\nThat would be my guess.\nThe second N.\nYeah.\nIt just looks odd.\nWell, maybe they pronounced it a little differently, too.\nlike Phil Hartman probably.\nSo, uh, so when he was born in 1948 when he was still named Phil Hartman, he was born in Brford, Ontario.\nAnd that might sound familiar to hockey fans because that's where Wayne Gretzky's from.\nBut after Wayne Gretzky, I would say Phil Hartman's probably the second most famous person from Brford, Ontario.\nAnd boy, I hope you're right.\nI'm totally not.\nThere's going to be like Tony Kayan or something will be from from Brainford, Ontario, although she may still fall behind um Phil Hartman.\nUh she passed away too, I believe.\nRight.\nI don't know.\nI stopped keeping up with her after she and David Coverdale broke up.\nI think Wayne Gretzky is alive though.\nYes, he is.\nAlive and slapping.\nThat's right.\nUh Phil was a middle kid, number four of eight.\nAnd as often times with a middle child, uh especially in Phil's case, when you have an older brother who is like super athletic and handsome and a younger sister that needed special care, uh because of a rare condition called Angelman syndrome, Phil uh it seems like felt like he needed to sort of just attract attention by goofing off and being uh the class clown, the family clown.\nYeah, that's what middle kids do.\nHe had like Jan Brady syndrome, but instead of wearing an afro wig, he became actually funny person, right?\nYeah.\nUm I guess one of the big things that happened to him was when he and his family moved to California when he was 10.\nOkay.\nNine, eight, something like that.\nUm he was around that age and California like really suited his blood.\nI mean he was born in Ontario.\nwhen you move to like Malibu area, like you're that's a pretty good move typically.\nI I love Toronto and I'm not like throwing shade on Ontario in general, but you know, when you move out to Southern California from there, it's it's a little different, you know.\nYeah.\nEspecially if it turns out you love surfing, sailing, and smoking weed or smoking grass at the time, I guess you would say.\nYeah.\nThe three S's.\nYeah.\nbecause he uh something that I learned yesterday was that Phil Hartman was a big pthead.\nYes.\nBut the kind that the cops wouldn't search your car if you got pulled over, which is a lesson to all those ptheads out there.\nYou don't have to look like a pthead to be a pthead.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nHe can look straight and make the cops laugh and they'll just say, \"Go along your day.\nYou're just a fun kid.\"\nExactly.\nI'll just totally ignore that smell coming out of your car.\nYeah.\nSo, um Yeah.\nHe he was really into Southern California life.\nApparently, he was a great surfer by the time he was 13, this guy was just full of surprises.\nYeah.\nUm and around this time, maybe even a little earlier, he uh he started to get into comedy.\nHe started doing the he took the steps that every young comedian takes, and that's you start idolizing some different comedians, stand-up comedians.\nAnd his were um Bob um New Hart.\nYeah.\nAnd uh the other one and Jonathan Winters who even if you don't know who Jonathan Winters is but you're a Mor and Mindy fan.\nYeah.\nHe was the giant old baby that arrived in an egg at Mor and Mindy's doorstep I guess.\nYeah.\nAnd Wyinners and New Hart actually they were sort of comedians comedians back then in that era from like the 1950s and into the 60s.\nUh and both of them were just incredible standups.\nJonathan Wyinners was so funny.\nUh especially like with character work and stuff like that, which New Hart didn't do.\nSo between the two of those, he got a pretty like well-rounded comedy education, memorizing those albums, doing like I did as a kid, memorizing comedy albums, performing bits uh for friends and family, stuff like that.\nAnd uh especially on Winter Side, those impressions that Jonathan Winters would do, Phil Hartman would copy those and then come up with his own.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd very quickly he excelled past even Jonathan Wyers.\nLike he was in Rich Little area by the time he was probably um you know mid teens.\nYeah.\nThere's a great story they found.\nI think it was from the book um that he and a bunch of friends went skiing at Mammoth Mountain outside of LA.\nAnd as the story goes, they were hanging around at the hot springs that night and Phil's friend said, \"Hey man, start, you know, doing some of your your bits here for everybody and impressions.\"\nAnd um this sounds like one of those stories has sort of, you know, grown over the years.\nMhm.\nBecause they say over over two hours Phil uh performed basically in front of a hundred strangers.\nUm I'm not quite sure if I believe that part because I've been to parties at ski resorts hanging out at hot springs and I'm sure he got a lot of jokes in, but I'm not sure if everyone would just sit there for two hours and watch some guy, right?\nAnd then one of his friends announced, \"Ladies and gentlemen, that was Mr. for Phil Hartman and someday he's going to be a big star.\nRemember this night.\nYeah, maybe it happened, but it's probably apocryphal, but I I bet a version of that story happened where Phil was like the life of the party essentially is my takeaway.\nYeah.\nFrom from a pretty early age, right?\nSo, he's clearly funny.\nHe's really good at impressions, but his path to um comedy, I guess, was kind of ciruitous um because he well his brother, his older brother, the handsome, athletic one you mentioned earlier, John.\nMhm.\nJohn decided he wanted to try to get into acting.\nAnd I guess this was before Phil could even get a chance.\nUh and John went to Hollywood, came back reporting that he was not okay with how seedy Hollywood was.\namoral, not anything like a an Ontarian would would be okay with.\nYeah.\nAnd so he said, \"I'm not going to do acting.\"\nAnd I think that kind of scared Phil a little bit or at least guided him away from acting for a little while.\nYeah, it seems like it.\nUh John went into the music business and co-founded a management company uh called Hartman and Goodman.\nAnd it seems like they had a real um had their thumb on the pulse.\nThumb on the pulse.\nSure, you can do that, right?\nYeah, you could use your thumb for that.\nUh, they had their thumb on the pulse of that Laurel Canyon sort of um, country rock scene because they ended up managing the likes of Neil Young, America, Buffalo Springfield, the Eagles, Joanie Mitchell, Jackson Brown, Mamas and the Papas.\nWow.\nKind of that that whole scene they were management for.\nThat is a mellow roster, man.\nIt is.\nAnd probably a lot of grass being smoked.\nYes.\nAnd Phil smoked a bunch of it, too.\nHe got brought on eventually.\nHe went to art school for a little while, tried to go to the University of Hawaii, was turned down, and I'm sure he wanted to go to the the University of Hawaii to surf.\nThat's exactly what I thought.\nYeah.\nSo, his older brother was like, \"Hey, man, you're not doing anything.\nYou got some art school under your belt.\nWhy don't you come and work for me as a roadie?\"\nBecause that's what people who go to art school end up doing almost invariably.\nYeah.\nUh he hooked him up with a little hippie rock band called Rock and Fu.\nF O.\nUh I don't Did you listen to any Rock and Fu?\nI didn't.\nUm I looked up the the band members though.\nOne of them was uh on it was a child actor prior to Rock and Fu.\nHe was on F Troop, Gunm Smoke, a bunch of other stuff.\nAnd then another one was the guitarist on a lot of the Monkeys hits.\nOh, that's cool.\nI listened to like three Rock and Fu songs and I I liked it.\nOh, okay.\nI saw a photo of the band and I was like, I'm not listening to that.\nWell, it was it's probably not your bag, baby.\nIt It was that sort of uh you know, kind of that again that Laurel Canyon sort of country rock thing.\nI dug it.\nI thought it was pretty cool.\nHey, I love America.\nDon't get me wrong.\nI think they're great, but you're no communist.\nOut of out of all of the list of of bands that you rattled off, they're, you know, I I like that band the most.\nYeah, it's just not your bag.\nI get it.\nI'm not I'm not uh bagging on you.\nOkay.\nThanks for not bagging on it on me for it not being my bag.\nYeah, I mean you like craft work for god's sakes and elevator music.\nI like I like most stuff just going to listen to the bands that you rattled off.\nDefinitely no.\nNo.\nYeah, I'm violently opposed to listening to Eagles.\nThey they manage Sunny and Share too.\nYou probably like them the most.\nThey're fine.\nOkay.\nI don't remember what I said on our Sunny and Sher episode, but I don't remember ever being like super into their music.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nI guess none of this really matters because what we're really talking about is Phil Hartman and him being a roadie.\nYeah.\nHe kind of started living the rock and roll lifestyle as a roadie for some of these bands.\nAnd because he had um some art school and he was kind of a developing artist at the time, his brother was like, \"Hey, why don't you do some of these album covers for some of the bands?\"\nAnd he did.\nAnd and at least one of them was pretty good.\nYeah.\nHe did um two for Rock and Fu.\nI think they only did two albums.\nSo he he he dominated their album cover art.\nNice.\nUh he did some for Crosby Sills and Nash or Sills and Nash.\nYeah, I wrote that too.\nAmerica.\nHe did one for your favorite band America.\nYep.\nUh did one for Poco that's probably the most noteworthy uh for their album Legend of this.\nIt's a very minimalist um artwork of a of a horse.\nMhm.\nUh, and I wanted to mention it is all over the internet that he did the cover for Steelely Dan's seminal album, Asia, and he did not.\nUh, but it's everywhere on the internet as fact, and it's it's apparently not true.\nWhat a weird rumor cuz that's just such an arcane fact about him that he ever designed any album covers, but then for a rumor to be about him making one that he didn't, that's really bizarre.\nBut that's the internet for you, right?\nYeah.\nAnd I'm I'm pretty positive it wasn't him because other people sleuththed it out and dug up the actual artist.\nAnd uh so if you're about to email and say, \"Dude, he did Asia.\"\nI think he did not.\nNo, the one who the guy who actually did it was Phil Hartman with two N's, right?\nThat's why people were confused, I think.\nYeah, good point.\nSo, uh around this time also, Phil, uh kicked off, and by the way, we're on a firstname basis with Phil Hartman, so we're just going to keep calling him Phil.\nHe kicked off um what would become essentially his trademark for his love life, which was he would fall head over heels for a very very pretty um girl.\nAnd they would be hot and heavy for a while and then he would get married and then basically be like, I this isn't working out after a couple of years.\nAnd the first person he did that with when he was, I think, 21, maybe 22, uh was a 19-year-old woman from Malibu named Gretchen Lewis.\nand um she got pregnant pretty quickly.\nWell, they started dating, but they didn't keep the kid, but they got married after all.\nYeah.\nUm they divorced in 1972.\nSo, I guess either two years or a little under two years.\nAnd uh after that, he got his first professional stage credit uh when he played Harold uh Harold Hill and The Music Man for the Santa Monica Theater\n\n\nMhm. And uh Mike Thomas, the guy who wrote the biography, had a quote about uh from one of Phil's co-stars in The Music Man that said, \"Phil was a true artist. He didn't really march to the same drum as other people, although it was a part of him that wanted to be perceived as normal. He went through life trying to find a character that he could present to the public that seemed normal and wholesome.\" And that is also sort of a repeated theme when you talk to friends and colleagues and family over the years was that no one knew the real Phil. And I've known people like that. It's an interesting thing to sort of create personas rather than be yourself. And that seemed to kind of be the case with him.\n Yeah. He was heavy into impression management basically at everywhere in his entire life. Oh yeah. In all corners, right?\n Yeah. And also just one thing about his first acting credit being playing Harold Hill because he went on to play Lyall Lanley or Lanley, I can't remember which one, who is basically the the um Simpsons version of Harold Hill from the Music Man in the Montreal episode.\n Written by Conan O'Brien, man. Yeah, he was one of the better Simpson writers early on. He was uh but on that thing about not seeing the real Phil, there was one friend who later said uh that there was a small room inside Phil that no one will ever get to. So just sort of kind of reinforcing that idea.\n Mhm. And the friend said, \"I hear it stinks of feet.\"\nShould we take a break?\n I think it's time. Yeah.\n All right. We're going to take a break and come back and talk uh about Phil's entry into the Groundlings right after this.\n[Music]\nSo, Chuck, we've surely talked about the Groundlings here or there. Um, there's just no way we haven't, but just to refresh, they are a sketch and improv comedy troop founded in LA. uh who've basically launched the careers of tons and tons of comedians, including a lot of people on Saturday Night Live. Apparently, Saturday Night Live drafts heavily from the Groundlings, Second City. Um and that's it.\n Uh but some of the some of the people from Saturday Night Live who were Groundlings, including some who were groundlings with Phil Hartman. Um John Loveitz was one.\n Yeah. Sherio Terry, Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wig, Will Frell. Um, and the list just keeps going on.\n Forte. Got to mention Forte.\n He wasn't on Saturday Night Live, though. That's why I didn't mention him.\n What was he?\n Will Forte was Mcgruber, my my man.\n Oh, I didn't realize that was a Saturday Night Live character. Sorry, Will. Sorry.\n And the Falconer.\n I didn't realize that he was on Saturday Night Live. I thought those were like standalone things. No, he I mean I I just mentioned that because Forte is one of my all-time favorite actors and SNL character uh members, cast members.\n Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to you both then.\n No, you didn't insult me. I just I just love Forte. He did he did the weirdest characters on that show kind of consistently and I always just respected him for that.\n Nice. Um well, that's great. Was he the last man on Earth?\n Yeah. Yeah.\n Okay. I like that too.\n Yeah, he's wonderful. I like him a lot. I like him separately. I also um like The Last Man on Earth. So, now that the two are joined, I really like him even more.\n Yeah. My only Will Forte experience was uh I think I've mentioned this before, but he was an attendee at a good friend's wedding and my friend sat me uh sat Emily and I at his table because he knew I was such a fan. And I partied all night with Will Forte and he was the coolest, funnest dude.\n Oh, that's that's a great story.\n Yeah. Just a real sweetheart.\n So, um Yeah. So, so we were talking about the groundlings, right?\n Yeah.\n And um this is I don't know. This story doesn't seem to be apocryphal. It seems to be actually true. It's just exactly how it played out is kind of under question, but there was a a birthday party that a friend of Phil Hartman had. I guess a group of them went to a Groundling show and before the show, Phil Hartman just decided to get up on stage and start doing some of his act.\n Could that be true? I I supposedly I don't I mean somebody who's hungry for the stage I guess.\n Yeah, I guess. Yeah, sure.\n Right.\nAnd so for two hours he had a hundred strangers just totally enrapped.\n No, a hot springs developed in the room.\nBut no, apparently he he um he definitely killed on stage and the the the story is that the groundlings came up to him after he got off stage and were like, \"You're in. You want to be in?\" That seems to not be true. It seems to be that he went up to them afterwards like, \"Hey, what do you think about me getting a an audition now?\" And they said, \"Sure.\" And he went and auditioned and they said, \"You're in.\"\n Yeah. See, that's the first part of the uh second part was the part that I don't believe.\nRight.\n Cuz I don't see that how there's any way at an improv theater, I know a lot of people in those theaters over the years, and for someone just to jump up on stage and do a bit, I bet they would not have been like, \"You're wonderful. Can you join?\" They would have been like, \"Dude, don't ever do that again.\"\nRight. Exactly. Like if they went up to him afterward, they probably would have said like, \"Please leave.\"\n Yeah. Yeah.\nSo, who knows? Uh, but it's a good story. Um, I would love to eventually to do episodes on the Groundlings Second City in UCB is just like a little trifecta suite.\n Okay, great.\n At any rate, uh, no matter how it happened, Tracy Newman, who was the founding member of the Groundlings, said that Phil Hartman walked into the Groundlings ready to go.\n Right. And that would also there was a similar quote I think from Lauren Michaels years later that said he basically was ready the moment he walked into Saturday Night Live too.\n Yeah.\n He was just a very dedicated actor. Um and one of the people who really looked up to him became one of his best friends of fellow groundling John Lovevitz. And he was saying that he would he called him the king of the groundlings which is pretty cool. Um, as he as his like career went on, he became known as like the most reliable actor in any group. Like he would stick to the to the the um the sketch.\n Yeah.\n Even if it was going badly, he would hang in there. He wouldn't bail on it. He would just keep going until the end. And usually from the impression I have is that if he was in a sketch, if if it would have gone badly otherwise if other people were in it, if he was in it, it probably wasn't going badly in the first place, which makes it easier to stick to.\n Yeah, he he just seemed kind of unflapable. Um we'll we'll talk about some SNL stuff in a bit, but um yeah, we I'll save it for then, but one of his most popular Groundlings characters was uh Chick Hazard, who was the the hard-boiled detective like out of a film noir. And that's a character that he would sort of reprise in different ways over the years.\n Mhm.\n Um he was a good he was just good with his mouth and good with words and could just rattle off really complex long strings of uh comedic dialogue like you know pitch perfect without missing a beat and just just very very skilled. Like some people are funny and some people are super skilled and he was one that was both.\n Right. Yeah. Well put Chuck. I think we can end the podcast there or we should talk about his second marriage.\n Okay. Well, well, first though, we should say he was with the Groundlings for 11 years and that is quite a while um for being a member of a sketch comedy troop, including one that doesn't ne has it doesn't have a TV show or anything. It's like a live theater group. It's a long time. Um but he I think that's kind of like a an indicator of the dedication that he brought to acting, comedy. Yeah.\n Comedic acting.\nI'm not sure.\n Yeah. I mean, he didn't sort of make it uh in the public eye until he was in his late 30s. And that's just a long time to hang in there.\n Yes.\nUh especially in comedy. It's not like late 30s is old, but if you haven't made it by that time as an actor or comedian or something, you you're probably sort of wondering like, well, should I take up, you know, surfing again?\n Right? To those stuff you should know listeners out there in your late 30s trying to break into acting still, do not be discouraged by what Chuck just said, just keep going, guys. you.\n No, don't start surfing.\nI mean, we I I didn't uh get into my career until my late 30s and didn't get really success until my 40s. So, I'm I'm living pretty I mean, you're younger than me, so you were just a pup.\nNo, that's not true. I was in my mid30s when things started to pick up for sure.\nNo, but I mean, it's funny that I said that because we're good examples of like, hey, you never know what's coming around the corner.\n That Oh, that's absolutely true. Boy, I could tell you some stories of times when I thought this life is not gonna work out for me.\nOh boy. You and me both, man.\n So, um, we said that he got he split up with his first wife, Gretchen, in 1972.\nHe did the Bachelor thing for about another decade and, uh, he ran into a woman named Lisa Jarvis. I'm not sure how they met or even necessarily when, but I know in 1982 they got married 10 years after his last divorce and it basically followed the same pattern as his first marriage. Um he just like it just was like fireworks and then it cooled off and then he lost interest.\nYeah. Their marriage only lasted a few years. They divorced in 1985.\nUm the same year that he ended up having some some of his first big successes.\nUh, and that was because 5 years prior, uh, a guy walks into the Groundlings in 1980 named Paul Rubin's with a character named Peewee Herman under his, uh, arm or under his belt.\n Yeah. Have you seen the documentary yet?\n Uh, I still have not since you asked me yesterday.\n I know. I thought maybe you would have gone and watched it last night or something, but Okay. So,\n no, it's it's so close to being on my TV, you have no idea.\n It's really good. Um, but he so there's a lot about him developing the Pee-Wee Herman character, Paul Rubin's at the Groundlings with a lot of help from other groundlings.\n Mhm.\n Apparently, and they show some of the early stuff um on this documentary, he was much more like um obnoxious.\n He threw Tootsie Rolls at the crowd. He would insult the crowd. Wow. And then even after he kind of started to get peee-ew like developed, those early stage shows were full of like sexual innuendo and stuff that a little kid wouldn't pick up on, but adults would find funny. But there weren't little kids at these shows anyway, so it didn't matter. Right.\nRight.\n But one of the one of the people, my point was that really helped develop it was Phil Hartman.\n And I think even up to the first season of Peewee's Playhouse, he played Captain Carl. His character was he played a character on Pee-Wee's Playhouse for the first season.\n Yeah. The the sirly boat captain, Captain Carl. There were other groundlings around as well. Uh either, you know, in the show with him or or writing for him, and Phil was one of the writers as well.\n Uh and they were selling out every night. They ended up at the Groundlings. They ended up moving to the Roxy Theater, which was a little bit bigger. Uh which we talked about in our Sunset Boulevard episode.\n Yeah.\n And or if it hasn't come out yet, we will talk about it on that episode. Yeah.\n And then in 1980, there was a a producer named Paula Kaufman who said she wanted to create a kid show for adults, saw Peewee at the Groundlings and was like, \"This is it.\" Uh, this is the show.\nYeah. Again, this documentary so like this particular part when they're developing the TV show is just it's just not so amazing, right?\n I can't wait.\n So, Phil was there when um Paul Rubin's did uh an HBO special. It was essentially one one I guess a HBO version of the stage show that that it started out as that caught the attention of other people in Hollywood and they said, \"Hey, how about a movie and they uh did Peewee's Big Adventure together.\" Uh Phil Hartman was a co-writer on that and that was 1985. And so things are finally starting to like pick up in ways that that Phil Hartman had been hoping. Like he had been writing scripts, he'd been auditioning for TV shows. Now all of a sudden he had a a hit movie writing credit under his belt. So he's thinking, \"Okay, things are about to take off.\"\nWhich explains why in 1985 when Lauren Michaels came to him and said, \"Hey, do you want to audition for Saturday Saturday Night Live?\" He said, \"No, I'm good. I'm going to pass on that.\"\n Yeah.\nThis was uh Lauren Michaels return to SNL. He very famously had an absence from the show and the show kind of uh did not farewell without Lauren Michaels the creator.\n You weren't a fan of the Tim Kazarinsky years.\n Uh I mean no some of that stuff is okay but just as a general um success the show was kind of going downhill.\n Yeah.\n But I did I I get your joke first of all. Tim Kasarinsky.\nHe was funny though. I like that.\n Oh no\n\n\nHe was, he was like perfect for the characters he played, like on um, *Police Academy*. I can't remember his character's name. He was great on that. Same guy. I forgot about that. Yep. Uh, but Lauren came back to save the show uh in 85, 86. Um, he again, like you said, asked Phil to come aboard. He said no because he was uh, you know, he thought he could make it as an actor, you know, in just regular comedies. And John Levitz joined instead. And then John Levitz got him another audition in 8 for the 86, 87 season. Mhm. He went in, uh, he had already met Lauren a couple of times. Uh, one when he met Lauren Michaels, I believe at the uh, I think when when Reuben's hosted *SNL* for the first time. Yes. Uh, is when he first met Lauren, but then he was also had a small part in *Three Amigos*, which Lauren produced. And then if you, if you ever have a chance, just sit down on YouTube and watch the Phil Hartman audition for *SNL*. Um, he did that Chick-hazard character first. He did a one of the fake commercials, and that's where you can tell just how skilled he is because it's one of those fast-talking commercials where he's talking like this about a product, but it's not, you know, he's not reading cards. It's just in his brain and memorized, and he just, it's flawless. Uh, and you hear something that you just never hear in an *SNL* audition, which is people laughing. They're very famous for just sort of sitting there stonefaced. Yeah. Even if you're doing well and you hear people laughing in the background, right? Yeah, that is very telling for sure. Um, so there, one, there's one part of his audition reel, um, where he does an impression of a German comedian doing impressions of famous people. It was so good. He said the, the most f, the funniest man in Germany, Gur Johan, right? Yeah. And so Gutter does impressions of like Jack Nicholson, John Wayne, Jack Benny, but they're all speaking German. And it's just like a spot-on impression of, of John Wayne. Yeah, speaking German, and he's doing an a, a German, an impression of a German comedian doing these impressions. It's just amazing. He goes right into it. Yeah. It just, it really does show off his talent. Plus, it's also hilarious, too. Yeah. You know, a lot of times when you talk about people being funny, it, it loses its funniness. Yeah. So, just go watch it. Agreed. Totally agree. Uh, he was hired with a pretty rockstar cast. Um, all new members, Jan Hooks, Dana Carvey, uh, Victoria Jackson, and Kevin Nean. Man, what a dream team. Yeah, pretty good. Uh, and that really kind of helped bring the show back. And how, I mean, to me, that's like the, the golden age. I think it destroys the 70s. The 70s was cool and like amazing and and, you know, really um, energetic, but the 80s were just like pro, okay, to me. Okay. So, it could be just that's one, the one I grew up with. Who? Who knows? But, I mean, there, there is that theory that whatever age you were in high school, I think is your favorite, what you think is the best *SNL* cast. Okay. Well, I, I might subscribe to that theory. No, I, I love that era. So, um, let's back up a second because you said that he met Lauren, Phil Hartman met Lauren Michaels when Paul Rubin's Peewee hosted *Saturday Night Live* in 1985. Mhm. And the reason that he was there was because um, Paul Rubin brought Phil Hartman along and another collaborator from the Groundlings, John Paragon, as his, his writers to work with the, the *Saturday Night Live* writers to make good sketches for Peewee Herman for that, that episode. Right. So Peewee or Paul introduced Phil to Lauren. Lauren comes to call in the next year and the year after that, and um, eventually Phil says, &quot;Hey Paul, I've got to go. I'm, I' I finally got my break. I'm going on a *Saturday Night Live*, and um, Paul was not happy about that. If you've seen the documentary, which I know you haven't, they covered this. I, I watched it real quick just now. Okay. So, so you know, then they covered this in the documentary. Apparently, it's not a very well-known or it's kind of a forgotten story, but they had a falling out and they didn't really talk or ever reconcile for the rest of Phil Hartman's life because Paul was, and there's really no other way to put it, very, very jealous. He felt spurred. Um, jilted. Spurned, jilted. Spurred to action. Um, and he, he was also, yeah, very jealous because he had tried out for *Saturday Night Live* and did not get picked up. Oh, and I can't remember who got the, the spot instead of him. And then um, yeah, and then Phil Hartman left PeeWee's Playhouse to go to *Saturday Night Live*. So Paul was kind of a, not the most forgiving person from what I can tell from the documentary. So he just held that grudge for the rest of Phil Hartman's life. Oh man, that's sad. It is sad for sure. I hate hearing that. I might pause that part or skip over it when uh, I watch the documentary tonight. Okay, it's at 1:23:36 is when it starts. Uh, shall we take our final break? Uh, yeah. All right, let's take another break and we'll talk about uh, a meeting in 1985 that would change the course of Phil Hartman's life right after this. [Music] All right, as promised, uh, a meeting in 1985 would change the course of Phil Hartman's life. And that is when Phil met a woman named Brenndall at a party. Uh, she was a tall, beautiful blonde, um, from Minnesota, but moved to LA to be a model or an actress or both. And previous to meeting him in the late 70s and early 80s, she had um, an alcohol problem. She had a cocaine problem, but had gotten sober to her credit and was looking for a good dude to um, hook up with. And when she met Phil, he was, this is sort of right before um, *Peewee's Big Adventure* came out and he got the offer to uh, you know, be on *SNL*. So he was at a pretty low point auditioning and his coming out of that second marriage. And so he was like, &quot;All right, this beautiful woman loves me.&quot; And then maybe validates me in a certain way. And so they got together. They did. Um, and it was just like all the other ones except this one was like when it burned red hot that could also be really bad, too. Yeah. It wasn't just like two people super into each other. It was also two people who like couldn't, couldn't like just, just clashed a lot, right? So, they would get in really big fights and then they would make up, and they would get in another fight and then they would make up. And despite this early on, they still ended up getting married and went on to have two kids, uh, Shawn and Bergen. I think Sean was the oldest uh, and he was the boy and Bergen was their little girl. And um, from all accounts, like uh, Brinn was a really good mom and really loved Phil Hartman, but there was a huge issue in that she was an aspiring actress and she wanted to, I think she wanted Phil to help her career more than he was comfortable helping it. Yeah. Uh, and I totally get this. He was not the kind to like be like, &quot;Hey, can you get my wife on your show?&quot; Or, &quot;Yeah, you know, have you seen my wife? She's great. Why don't you give her a shot?&quot; He just would not do something like that, right? So, that then and there caused um, some pretty, pretty serious static between the two. And then on top of that, after they got together, his career actually started taking off. So, in, in addition to him not helping her, he, she was like living in his shadow. So that was a big source of conflict between the two. Yeah, for sure. So he's got this marriage that starts, you know, that's, you know, rocky, like his other relationships had been, but it has staying power more than the others. Mhm. Uh, he was 37 when *SNL* started, right? Kind of when they got together. And his nickname on *SNL* was the glue. Uh, you kind of talked earlier about how he was always sort of looked at as a stabilizing force in the Groundlings and *SNL*. And uh, his nickname was the glue because he was just perfect basically whenever he performed. Um, we got to talk about some of his best characters. Uh, Phil Donahghue uh, was one of my favorites when he did Phil. Yeah. Um, Ed McMahon, of course, uh, the aforementioned Ed McMahon was one of my favorites. Uh, I really for some reason loved the Frankenstein, Tonto, Tarzan bit that he and Kevin Nean and John Levitz did when they did *Little Drummer Boy*. It was so silly, but I loved it. It was pretty good. He was Frankenstein, right? He, yeah, he was Frankenstein. I think Love it was Tanto and Ne was Tarzan. If you haven't seen it, look it up. But basically the whole point is none of them uh, speak English, and so they would do like Christmas songs and Frankenstein would just go, and Love did Tanto and and uh, you know, looking back, it was a probably a fairly racist depiction of a Native American. Yeah. And then you said Nean was Tarzan and uh, I don't even know what Tarzan did. Probably just like jungle grunting. It was, it's very good. I mean, like, basically, we could just sit here for the rest of the episode and talk about Phil Hartman sketches because each one was better than the last. Like, um, unfrozen caveman lawyer. Yeah. First of all, what a, what a like just an exceptional idea to start with, but he's, he just pulls it off so perfectly. This smarmy lawyer who's a, an unfrozen caveman who went to law school and became a smarmy um, uh, I guess a personal injury lawyer. Yeah, I think so. And again, like we can talk it out and it will kill any funniness to it. Just go watch that one. Go look up *Colon Blow*, the *Saturday Night Live* commercial. Yeah. Classic. It is. Um, and uh, then Ronald Reagan mastermind. Did you watch that one? Yeah, I, yeah, I remember. I didn't rewatch it, but I remembered it. I rewatched it and I remembered it. It came out around the time the Iran Contra affair scandal broke. And at the time, Ronald Reagan was like, I, I don't know anything. Like I didn't, I didn't know. Who knows who knew? Like I didn't know this was going on. So they make fun of him. Um, and his public persona just kind of being this daughtering old man who, who does, doesn't really have his finger on the pulse of his own administration to this when people aren't around and it's just him and his staff. Him just like barking orders and being totally super sharp and being the, the mastermind behind everything. It's and like the, his just turning public Reagan on and off and then turning that private, like aggressive Reagan on and off. It's just, I mean, like, you really see like this guy was amazing, like, like one of a kind basically. I can't think of anybody who could do the stuff that he did before him or since. Yeah, for sure. Uh, absolutely well said. Um, he would go on to do another president very famously in '92 when Bill Clinton won the presidency, and he had a just a dead-on Clinton impersonation, just not only the voice, but just his sort of uh, the smarmy kind of Bill Clinton thing and the ego, like, they, they lampuned him very, very well, very effectively. Yeah. He, there's uh, one where he was jogging into a McDonald's while he was running for president, doing like a campaign stop, and he's like, you know, about to kiss a baby, and he looks past the baby and and says to the mom like, &quot;Hey, are you going to eat the rest of those French fries?&quot; And it just goes from there. Oh my god, it's perfect. So, um, one of the things about *Saturday Night Live* that I learned even as a young viewer, if you're on beyond a certain number of years, it's starts to have a certain kind of look, like it kind of shows the world like you are perfect for *Saturday Night Live*, but for some reason it's not clicking outside of that. So, you just hang in there as long as you can at *Saturday Night Live*. And what's astounding and nuts is that that happened to Phil Hartman. He was there through a couple of cast changes, like big time, huge cast changes where it went from like Kevin Neland and Jan Hooks to Chris Farley and David Spade. Um, and Chris Rock too at the same time as well. I think Sarah Silverman came in around that time too. So like he was in for a huge transition. He straddled two big transitions of *Saturday Night Live*. And that's a just like with the Groundlings, this is a really long time to be a member of *Saturday Night Live*. And I think he felt um, overlooked because a lot of his colleagues were starting to get their own movies and he was not. Yeah. I mean, he was on for eight seasons. Uh, over those eight seasons, he did, he was in more sketches than any other cast member. Uh, when he retired from *SNL*, they gave him on the show, they gave him a, a little statue of an Elmer's glue, like aix to a, a trophy kind of thing because of his nickname, the glue. But yeah, he, he definitely was getting side parts in these movies. Like he was in *So I Married an Ex-mer*, he was in *Coneheads*, but he wasn't the star. And by the time he was uh, Rock and Sandler and those guys came along in Farley, he was in his 40s and he was kind of playing the straight man roles, like the old man of the family. Uh, one, you know, sort of obvious example is the uh, Matt Foley, um, you know, the living in a van down by the river, the motivational speaker sketch. Phil Hartman was the dad, and you know, no one remembers that because everyone remembers Chris Farley. Um, quick aside, that sketch was created and written by Bob Odenkirk. Oh, I, I forgot he wrote for *Saturday Night Live* too. Yeah. And the reason I know that is because I watch Kevin, I follow Kevin Neon on Instagram and he does this, I don't know if he releases them as a podcast.\n\n\nI'm going to have to look, but he does these hikes through um one of the canyons there in LA in the Hollywood Hills, and he interviews people on these hikes, and he was interviewing Bob Odenkirk, and they were talking about that sketch.\nThat's awesome.\n Yeah, it's cool.\n It is a great sketch.\nBut you can kind of see how like Phil Hartman's super pro, um, really contained and perfect, um, delivery and style.\nIt, it, it doesn't jive well unless he's just playing it straight to somebody like Farley just going berserk, right?\n You know, totally.\n So, yeah, he finally he left.\nHe left on great terms.\nHe just killed Saturday Night Live.\nHe became a legend on Saturday Night Live.\nUm, and he went on to still have a pretty great career.\nHe went on to do four seasons of News Radio, which is one of the great, um, underrated office comedies along with um, Working, the Fred Savage was in.\nDid you ever see that one?\n No.\nIt was good.\nAnd Just Shoot Me is the other underrated office comedy of all time, I think, from the '90s at least.\nBut he was on four episodes of News Radio.\nHad a great character.\n Four seasons.\nYeah.\n Four, what'd I say?\nEpisodes.\n Yeah.\nSeasons for sure.\nUm, had a great character, Bill McNeel, and um, he just basically picked up a second part of his career.\nAnd then also simultaneously he was doing The Simpsons, too, which is where a lot of people fell in love with Phil Hartman.\nYeah.\nJust a little show called The Simpsons.\nUh, he was asked in 1990 to do some voiceover work for that show, and he said, \"Yeah, I'll do it, but just one time.\"\nBecause he apparently had a pretty bad experience doing voiceover anim, um, for animation for the Dennis the Menace animated show.\n I remember that.\nUh, but he said, \"I'll do it just once.\"\nBut then of course that didn't last because he was great on it, and he started working with the writers, started developing characters, and for eight seasons, uh, he voiced some of the most iconic characters, uh, of course the great Troy McClure and uh, Lionel Hutz, attorney at law, are the two sort of most notable, um, because you know, they would come on as their little side bits here and there, but Troy McClure actually ended up getting a pretty major storyline when he hooked up with um, which one was it?\nI think Patty.\nI don't remember.\nOne of Margie's two sisters.\nI couldn't remember if it was Patty or uh, oh god, Selma.\nYeah, that's right.\nBut it was one of them.\n Yeah, they fell in love.\nAnd uh, that's from one of my favorite lines from Troy McClure was after they went out on a date, he sees her the next day, and his famous line was, \"You may remember me from whatever, uh, like acting role that he was in.\"\nAnd in this case, he said, \"Uh, I'm Troy McClure.\nYou may remember me from certain dates like last night.\"\nYeah, he was well known for that.\nYou may remember me from such educational films as The Decapitation of Larry Leadfoot.\n Oh man.\n Or Here Comes the Metric system.\n Yeah.\n He was great.\nYeah.\nAnd like he had one episode where he was big, but the rest of the time it was just like you said, a little side thing.\nAnd he still created a legendary character times two.\nAnd as a matter of fact, when he died, the Simpsons are like, Lionel Hutz and um, Troy McClure will never appear on the Simpsons again.\nThey just couldn't, no one else could do it.\n Yeah.\nSo, speaking of him dying, this is going to go long because this is kind of an involved story, but um, he uh, like I said, he and Brinn had a lot of tension.\nApparently, Phil Hartman had an anxious avoidant attachment, um, style.\nMhm.\n Uh, when she wanted to talk, when she was confrontational, he would get, basically get in a sailboat and sail off to Catalina Island.\nUm, alone, I, I take it, but he was just, he would withdraw.\nYou couldn't get to him.\nUh, that was the way that he dealt with it.\nAnd she did not like that.\nI think it made her feel very lonely.\nAnd then again, she was living in a shadow.\nHe wasn't helping her career.\nThey had two kids.\nAnd again, she was a really, really good mom by all accounts.\nShe also had um, some former demons that she had conquered, including um, an alcohol addiction and an addiction to cocaine.\nUh, and she was clean when she and Phil met.\nAnd she stayed clean for a while.\nUh, but she got back on the cocaine train, um, after she did coke with Andy Dick at a News Radio party, Christmas party in 1997.\nYeah.\nI mean, we don't know if that's the first time she started back again, but as the story goes, uh, he offered her cocaine.\nUm, he said that he didn't know that she had had a drug problem before.\nUh, did not know that, um, apparently she had been clean.\nAnd John Loveitz for many, many years was very, um, public about blaming Andy Dick, um, for, you know, for her falling off the wagon.\nAnd it led to a crazy story where in 2007, John Loveitz assaulted Andy Dick at the Laugh Factory and like got into a, uh, I mean, I was going to say a fist fight, but it doesn't sound like it was punchy, but more John Loveitz, at least as the way he tells it, um, ramming Andy Dick's head back into the bar like repeatedly and said, \"I would have kept doing it too, but the bartender stepped in.\n I'm Frenchie.\"\nYeah, he uh, apparently he, he took over for Phil Hartman, um, after Phil Hartman died on News Radio, and like one of the first days he said to Andy Dick, \"I wouldn't be here if you hadn't given cocaine to Brinn.\"\nSo he blamed, um, Andy Dick for the death of Brinn and Phil.\nUh, so Andy Dick didn't like that.\nLater on he said he saw, they, they saw each other at a restaurant.\nHe said, \"I put the Phil Hartman hex on you.\nYou're the next to die.\"\nAnd then the next time they saw each other is when John Loveitz beat up Andy Dick, which I mean, had no idea about that.\nDid you?\n No, I, I didn't know that story until uh, today or yesterday or whenever you sent it over, which is just one of those crazy stories.\nUm, but very sadly, uh, it was May 27th, and you know, we should say Brenn at this point, um, she was upset about Phil's uh, you know, smoking too much weed.\nMhm.\n Um, she was had an anxiety problem.\nShe was suffering through some depression.\nUm, she got on anti-depressants.\nUh, started drinking again.\nNot sure who started the cocaine thing.\nMaybe Andy Dick, but she got back into cocaine and was in a pretty bad state of mind.\nAnd on May 27th, 1998, she had gone out for drinks at uh, an Italian restaurant and wanted to go to another bar, but her friend didn't want to.\nSo, she called up her old uh, drug and buddy from the '70s and early '80s, a guy named Doug.\nAnd Doug was clean now, but said, \"Why don't you come over to my house?\"\nShe had some more drinks over there and was basically complaining about her marriage, about Phil smoking too much pot and them not getting along and, you know, being just at loose ends.\nAnd at 1 in the morning, he's like, \"You know, you need to go home.\nYou need to go home to your husband.\"\n So, she, she did.\nI don't think she had much of a choice.\nDoug was like, \"You, you got to leave.\"\nUm, and I guess when she got home shortly after that, she and Phil got into an argument.\nPhil went off to bed, managed to fall asleep.\nAnd remember, Brenn is on Zoloft, has been drinking for hours now, and is on cocaine.\nAnd she went and um, got one of their guns, a 38 special, and walked up to Phil while he was sleeping and shot him three times, once in the head.\nAnd I, I never saw if he woke up or if he even knew it happened.\nHopefully not, and he just died while he was asleep.\nThat would be what I would hope, but he died instantly.\nUm, because he was shot three times at close range.\n Yeah.\nSo, uh, about an hour after that, she called up her friend Doug, who she was just with.\nShe was super, super drunk at this point.\nUh, Doug said, \"You need to just sleep this off.\"\nShe didn't tell him at that point when it happened.\nMh.\n And about 20 minutes later, she shows up back at Doug's house saying that she killed Phil, and he doesn't believe her.\nAnd then apparently, as the story goes, while she was there, the gun fell out of her purse.\nAnd he was like, \"What is going on?\"\nHe helps her sober up over the course of a couple of hours, um, drives her back over at about 6:00 in the morning to their house, and he sees Phil dead, and uh, he calls the cops, and at that point Brenn locks herself in the bedroom with Phil's body, and that's where she was when the cops arrived.\nYeah.\nUm, I, both of their kids were in the house at the time.\nI think uh, Shawn, the oldest, woke up, and Doug was like, \"Let's get you out of here.\"\nAnd took uh, Doug took Shawn outside to the police.\nBut the whole time Bergen's sleeping through like her mom just murdered her dad, and then it just gets worse actually.\n Yeah.\nSo she is barricaded in the room with Phil.\nUh, the cops are there.\nShe's making phone calls to friends and family saying, you know, confessing basically to what she had done.\nAnd finally her last call was to her sister Kathy.\nUh, she said, \"Take care of my children.\nJust let them know how much I love them.\"\nShe got a second gun and laid down on the bed next to Phil and shot herself and killed herself.\n Yeah, and became one of the most hated people in America, if not the world, almost overnight.\nI remember hating her guts when I heard about this.\nMe, too.\n Um, as an older person, I, I have a little more empathy for her.\nUm, just the amount of loneliness, and then also being on anti-depressants, cocaine, and alcohol definitely is not a good combination, especially when you have guns in the house.\nBut, um, yeah, I've changed my approach to her a little bit.\nAnd I was kind of um, happy to read that at the at the funeral, um, Phil's brother John was asking the people in attendance, like, please try to find it in your heart to forgive her for this.\nLike this wasn't, this is, this was a horrible thing, but it's not like she was evil.\nShe was a, a loving mo, a loving wife and a loving mother, and like, let's try to remember her for that.\n Yeah, for sure, and especially at the funeral to, to have the guts to say something like that was pretty, pretty standup thing to do, I think.\nUm, yeah, a good, a good, like, life lesson there.\nUh, Phil was, he was going to come back to News Radio.\nIt's not like he was done with the show.\nHe was going to come back for season 5, but like you mentioned, John Loveitz took over.\n Uh, the first episode of season 5 dealt with the death of the character.\nIt was called Bill Moves on.\n Yeah.\nVery emotional episode.\nUh, and I think you already mentioned that they, you know, The Simpsons was like, \"We're never ever going to get someone to do Troy McClure or Lionel Hutz again.\"\n Yeah, it's true.\nAnd then he finally got his, um, star on the Walk of Fame in 2014.\n Yeah.\nAnd we should mention, uh, Bin's sister Kathy respected her wishes, and she's who raised the kids.\n Yeah.\nAlong with her husband.\n Yep.\nSo, good for her.\nYeah.\nGood for them.\n Uh, that's Phil Hartman.\nUm, one of the sad outcomes of all this, Chuck, I think, is when you search Phil Hartman, just Phil Hartman, most of what comes up on the first couple pages of search engines is about the murder.\nYeah.\nYeah.\n Not like, look at all the hilarious stuff he did.\nSo maybe look up Phil Hartman SNL videos and just go from there.\n Totally.\nThat's all we have to say about Phil Hartman for now.\nSo I guess Chuck, it's time for listener mail.\nUh, this is from Katie Josiah, a six-month old baby.\n Oh, wow.\nAnd Chris, this is amazing.\n Hey guys, my wife and I were just uh, listening to the William A.\nMitchell story from a few weeks ago.\nWe heard that Bill was the inventor of Tang.\nMy wife is from Georgia, but I'm from the Midwest, so we always like to talk about things we grew up with, different foods and traditions, restaurants, etc., and how they were similar or sometimes very different.\nWell, I found out that I consumed Tang in a very unique way, apparently.\nHot.\nNo, I thought he was gonna say right up the nose.\n When I was young in the winter months in Ohio, my dad would warm up the kettle and mix Tang in boiling water.\nIt was a warm drink that we could have whenever we played out in the snow, and my sister and I loved it, and he called it hot Tang.\n Okay.\nAnd I just thought uh, all Tang was consumed hot, which is pretty funny.\nUm, I've actually never drank cold or even room temperature Tang.\n Uh, hope all is well with you and yours, with love from North Georgia, Katie, Josiah, 6 months old, and Chris.\nI would try that, especially with like a cinnamon stick.\n Yeah, it sounds like a, you ever have like Theaflu or something when you're sick?\n Man, or hot, or hot toddy.\n I love the taste of the flu so much.\nI would drink it once in a while when I'm not sick.\n It really puts you to sleep, man.\nIt really does.\n If you get the good stuff, I, I too love the flu.\nThe warning on the box about your liver is like, it scares me.\nSo, I only do it once in a while.\n Yeah.\nI mean, we, we should get them on as a sponsor, man.\n We should, we should drink it on, on the podcast once in a while.\n Yeah, but I bet Tang, Hot Tang is pretty similar.\nAnd I\n\n\nBet a little whiskey in there would be pretty good.\nYeah.\nWell, don't get Katie started this early.\nShe's only 6 months old.\nNo, the Katie is the wife.\nOh, okay.\nWell, who is 6 months old?\nThat, what was it?\nJosiah.\nOh, okay.\nI thought Katie's last name was Josiah.\nI see.\nThere was a comma in there that I wasn't aware of.\nYeah, Chris wrote the letter, right?\nHe married Katie.\nOkay.\nAnd they had Josiah 6 months ago.\nOkay.\nGotcha.\nWell, I I guess I should just say congratulations to Katie and John.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nFor Josiah and everything else.\nThere you go.\nUh yeah, and thank you also for uh sending the email.\nThat was a great one.\nHot Tang sounds wonderful.\nWe'll go try it.\nAnd if you want to be like Katie, Josiah, and Chris, who I may have just called John, I'm not sure.\nUh, you can send us an email too at stuffodcast@iheartradio.com.\n[Music]\nStuff you should know is a production of iHeart
