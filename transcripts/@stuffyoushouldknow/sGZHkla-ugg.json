  "cleanText": "Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.\n\nHey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here, too. And we're here to sniff you off the case with our brand new episode on Sherlock Holmes. Uh, have you ever read any Sherlock Holmes short stories or one of the four novels?\n\nYou should have started that off with Josh.\n\nJosh?\n\nYeah, I have. I've never read the novels. Um, but I've read quite a bit of the short stories. Yes.\n\nOh, okay. I didn't know you were a Sherlockian. I'm not. I would not call myself that because if you're a Sherlockian or in the UK a Holmesian, you are a like one of the original fans of fandom and I'm I mean I'm not there like I I don't qualify.\n\nNo. Okay.\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, more than me.\n\nSo, have you read any?\n\nNot a one.\n\nOh, you're missing out. They're really interesting and fun.\n\nYeah. I mean, not only that, I haven't really seen any of the stuff either.\n\nUm, there's some really good movies out there. Last night, just to brush up, I watched House of Fear, okay? Which is based on the short story The Five Orange Pips. And, uh, it's really good. Basil Wthbone and Nigel Rogers and just the straight ahead midcentury black and white Sherlock Holmes mystery that you think of when you think of a Sherlock Holmes movie, or most people do. Um, so they're good. They're really, the movies are generally good. Um, I've seen the worst version. people call the worst version uh Holmes and Watts.\n\nOkay, you saw that?\n\nNo, but I watched the clip and I was like, \"This is not that bad. This is exactly what you'd expect from Will Frell and John C. Riley.\" Like, what were you thinking? This is going to be like high art or something like that.\n\nOh, no. I just heard it was zero funny. Not that they were expecting something, you know, posh.\n\nWell, the clip I saw was at least one and a half% funny.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt has a half of a star on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nUh, all right. Well, let's get into it because this is a lot.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Let me just wrap this up. Okay.\n\nUm, yes, you should read some of the home stories.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay. Yeah, let's get into it now.\n\nUh, all right. Well, we're talking about Sherlock Holmes, the uh infamous, the famous fictional detective. Uh, I I learned I was about to say a lot, but basically everything about this was new to me. So, I learned everything brand new. I was this day years old when I learned everything.\n\nUh, but one of the things that I did I did not know for sure is that I always thought he was uh an official like Scotland Yard detective. I did not know that he was an amateur sleuth and that uh maybe he worked, you know, alongside Scotland Yard at times, but I just figured he was part of Scotland Yard.\n\nNo, he is the world's first consulting detective. That's what Arthur Conan Doyle, the um author, called him.\n\nAnother term for that is a private eye.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, he would work with Scotland Yard sometimes, but most of the time he was several steps ahead of Scotland Yard whenever they did come in to arrest somebody.\n\nYeah. Uh so, like I mentioned, there were four novels. There were 56 short stories over about a four decade uh plus period.\n\nMhm.\n\nUm which is a lot of writing. And apparently uh and this was in 2012 and he's been in quite a few more adaptations since then, but he's\n\nYeah.\n\nHe's the most frequently uh portrayed human literary character ever in film and TV.\n\nYeah. 254 times.\n\nWell, no. Way more than that now.\n\nDepicted. Yes. By 75 actors.\n\nYeah. More than that now.\n\nAt the Yeah. At the time in 2012, the nonhuman who'd been most adapted was Dracula, and he only had Sherlock Holmes beat by like a a handful.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nSo, there you go. Sherlock Holmes. Everybody loves to portray him. And that's something we'll try to get to the bottom of here because what we're talking about is and nearly 50-year-old like detective pulp fiction that has chapters of fans all over the world. Sherlock Holmes is one of the most famous characters ever written in the history of literature and people are nuts for him still today and some people just like don't get it. And there's there's something to get but not everybody can put their finger on it and we probably won't either but we'll try.\n\nYeah. I mean I think I never read it because I just don't read uh mysteries like that.\n\nWell, one of the things that separates him from the mysteries is that he uses deductive reasoning. like Agatha Christie, it's like, can you guess who it is? Maybe there's a clue or something in there. More often than not, there's really nothing in there that can tell you who did it.\n\nWith Sherlock Holmes, it might not be in there either. But what he uses is deductive reasoning where the kind of logic and reasoning he's using, like anybody has that that potential, that faculty. He's just particularly gifted with it. So he's I don't know. He's like a machine as far as logic goes, but he's also a deeply flawed person in a lot of ways, too. I think that makes him really interesting.\n\nYeah. And actually, I need to correct myself. I did Encyclopedia Brown, as I've mentioned before, and that's where that that train ended for me was in elementary school.\n\nYeah. But I mean, what a ride it was, right?\n\nIt was pretty great. Uh Watson is his sidekick. We'll talk a lot about him as we go. Um, and the first one was uh a study in Scarlet in 1887.\n\nAnd uh I mean let's go ahead and I guess just talk a little bit about how who Holmes is as a character. He's right uh he's definitely like portrayed as like a genius. Um he's sometimes can be very sort of flippant and arrogant. Um he's not very emotional. Uh Watson says, you know, um that he has no interest in women and that there's been speculation that Sherlock Holmes is a gay character. Um he's I believe Watson described him in a scandal in Bohemia from 1891 as the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen. But as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position.\n\nYeah. Which you don't want to do, especially as a gentleman in Victorian England. Right.\n\nYeah. And a bit of an enigma, right? as far as just kind of personal life.\n\nYeah. The reason why is because it was not a main driver of the the series that Conan Doyle wrote. Like there were illusions to his life outside of his his mysteries. Like he was well known to have a brother named Microoft. He was really passionate about boxing and he played the violin. Uh he was also very famous for um introvenously injecting cocaine in a 7% solution. Um, and these things were just kind of referred to here or there. Early on, the cocaine was kind of a driver of his character. Um, he was very self um, obsessed. He was very melancholy. Like he would shoot cocaine to like basically get through the tedium of a day because he was so smart. He couldn't possibly do so otherwise. But then as he developed, he became less of a well, a cocaine addict and more of a a fully fleshed out character whose the point and purpose was to figure out how to solve these mysteries using logic and deduction. And that's what he really became more than anything else.\n\nYeah. I mean, they've if you've seen uh if you haven't read and you've only seen like movie and TV versions, um you've seen a lot more of a character called Irene Adler. Mhm.\n\nUm Irene Adler is exists far more in the TV and film side. I believe she was only in one story. Um so she's been much much more uh portrayed on screen as maybe a maybe a love interest, maybe a um uh uh what's the word I'm looking for? Sort of like a foil at times.\n\nUm not quite like a a Mori Arti level. Professor Morardi is often the the main foil and sort of evil criminal mastermind. Mhm.\n\nBut Adler definitely exists a lot more in the film and television world.\n\nYeah. In the in the um world of Sherlock Holmes fans, they call her the woman. She's the woman who like\n\nBut he called her that.\n\nOh, did he call her that? Okay. Yeah.\n\nSo, like she's the one who caught his attention by foiling his his investigation. Like he figured out what happened, but he didn't catch the criminal, and that really caught his attention. Yeah. I think he'd only been thwarted like four times, and she was one of them, right?\n\nYeah. He's also been like famously diagnosed retroactively with everything from bipolar 2 disorder, depression, Asperger syndrome, and he's um also commonly given an INTJ personality type from the MyersBriggs test, which is analytical, logical, and with a strong intuition.\n\nThat seems to fit.\n\nIt does. So going back out into the the real world, if you're going to take the Doyian view of all this stuff that it's actually fiction written by Arthur Conan Doyle, the whole thing started in uh 1886\n\nI think when the first one that you just mentioned a study in Scarlet was published in Breitton's um Christmas annual.\n\nI think it was 87 and I only 87 correct it because there are Sherlockians and Homeians Holmesians.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nYeah. We should have totally given a COA at the beginning of this I think.\n\nYeah, there going to be minor errors here and there everyone.\n\nSure. So 1887 the first story comes out studying Scarlet. I think it's actually a novel. Um it was published in this Christmas annual and it didn't take off like a rocket until he started publishing the shorter stories in a magazine called The Strand. And this is at the time that Strand magazine was the most widely circulated monthly magazine in all of Britain. And it just so happened that Conan Doyle was writing these stories at a time when Britain had suddenly become a lot more literate and they they were hungry for new fiction. So he really kind of came in and brought Sherlock Holmes in at just the right time.\n\nYeah. So people are reading this thing like crazy. Uh I think they ended up collecting those short stories in well a collection called The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. And like you said, that was where I mean, I'm I'm sure the novels are great, uh, but he only did four of them. And it's it's really it seems like these short stories is where he found uh he found a place to sell a lot more stuff or, you know, I I guess sell is one way to say it or write a lot more stuff. Um, because, you know, it was they were less than 10,000 words. They were even short for detective short stories at the time. And I think they appealed to uh younger people quite a bit from what I I've read.\n\nYeah. Because at the time the younger generation were the were the ones who had just been educated through the public education system that had just been developed. So they were more likely to be able to read than their parents just statistically speaking.\n\nYeah. But they didn't want to read some long novel. They wanted to read a short story.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And also one of the other things too that um Conan Doyle figured out early on that I think people appreciate because it's so comfortable and familiar is essentially the same formula for basically every single one of the stories.\n\nYeah. Which I mean it's like Encyclopedia Brown and any kind of detective story. Um you're going to have a client come in or you know it evokes film noir as well. Uh a client comes in in this case to the very uh famous office 221B Baker Street.\n\nMhm. and the client themselves are going to um be sort of picked apart by Holmes at the beginning and he's going to make a lot of deductions about them and then evaluate the case and then you know hit the streets maybe maybe in disguise um and start doing the investigating of course solve the case right um capture the bad guy and then explain it all to Watson Scooby-Doo style at the end uh which I I mean is this I I know Holmes wasn't the first and We'll get into that fictional detective, but is this how that sort of trophy formula started?\n\nYes. Yeah, 100%.\n\nSo, none of the first uh fictional detectives did things like that.\n\nNo, not in any kind of formula like that as far as I know, and there were only maybe a dozen that came before him, but they were all just kind of throwing stuff at the fridge to see what stuck. It was Arthur Conan Doyle, who's the one who really figured it all out and just ran with it.\n\nThat's awesome. Uh they were illustrated by uh a guy named Sydney Padet and as far as the the look of Holmes um that was modeled on Padet's brother Walter and you know would just interpret whatever um Doyle was writing as far as what he would draw. So in the book for instance you know there's there's two things even if you don't know anything about Sherlock Holmes and in fact you probably call it the Sherlock Holmes hat and the Sherlock Holmes pipe.\n\nYeah. that big curvy huge bell pipe and then that uh deer stalker cap. That's what it's, you know, it's what it technically is, but everyone else just calls it the Sherlock Holmes hat.\n\nBut in the book, uh Doyle just says it's a close fitting cloth cap. He doesn't say he wore his deer stalker cap. That was an invention of Sydney Padet.\n\nYeah. And the that pipe is called a calabash pipe. And like you said, I mean like you could draw you right. you could draw like just a minimalist um profile of just those two things and around the world people would know exactly who that was.\n\nIt's like the when Michael Jordan had the Hitler mustache in that TV commercial.\n\nI forgot about\n\nand everyone's like, \"Why do you have the Hitler mustache,\n\nright? I totally forgot about that.\" Yeah. I mean, that one's You can't have that mustache anymore. And he\n\nNo, no, no. I feel like he should have known that.\n\nNo, you really couldn't. From basically the 1930s onward, it was off the table.\n\nYeah. I mean, not even it's not like he was doing it as an homage.\n\nI don't think so.\n\nBut it was definitely like what world is Michael Jordan living in where he doesn't know that just nobody does that.\n\nMhm.\n\nIt was funny.\n\nUm, so just one thing real quick for\n\n\nThe Sherlockians and the Homesians. I saw that it is contested that Walter, Sydney's brother, was the model. Apparently Sydney claimed he wasn't. No, everyone says that he was. So maybe Cydney Padet was just a pathological liar.\nMaybe. I mean, I'd have to see a picture of Walter to, you know, to know for sure.\nUh, yeah. Yeah, that's a really good way to put two and two together, I think. Very homesy in your approach.\nOh, elementary.\nUh, you want to take a break and come back?\nSure. Uh, yeah. Good timing. We'll be back right after this.\n[Music]\nBy the way, uh we're back. And uh I said elementary. Um apparently that wasn't something Doyle wrote. That came from one of the movies, right?\nThe movies are the first stage play. One of the two.\nYeah, maybe it was stage play. Yeah, I think the closest he wrote was exactly My Dear Watson.\nSo close. I mean, I'm not knocking Doyle, but Elementary is so much that's way catchier, for sure. So, the the the books themselves or the stories themselves are meant to be accounts of the cases of Sherlock Holmes that were written by his sidekick, friend, and roommate, um, John Hamish Watson. He's a doctor.\nDr. John.\nAnd Yeah, that's that was his side gig. Yeah. Um, so was that the one uh who was about spending the night together? Uh, yeah.\nI don't know much Dr. John. I do know that he was the uh inspiration for the Muppet uh band, right?\nOh, no. Okay, that's a different one. Okay.\nI think that was Dr. Hook in the medicine show I was just doing.\nDr. John is awesome. I saw him open for Cindy Looper once.\nOh, wow.\nThat was quite a combination.\nIt really is. No, this is a different Dr. John. This is Dr. John Watson, sidekick to Sherlock Holmes, and he supposedly is the one who's narrating and recounting all of these things.\nYeah. And right away, right off the bat, um he is sort of uh picked apart and deduced by Holmes when they first meet. Um Watson was an army medic that was wounded at the battle of uh Maywand in Afghanistan. And Holmes picks this up and Watson is like, &quot;Oh my god, who is this guy?&quot; like I I can't believe this dude has nailed this uh facet of my life right away.\nYeah, it was the first of many many many times Watson would be astonished by Holm's deductive reasoning skills.\nYeah, but he's kind of the heart, right? Like apparently Holmes is isn't the most likable guy, but Watson really brings this sort of heart to it.\nYes, absolutely. He's uh he's he's warm, he's empathetic, he he's just much it's it's basically like you and me, right? like you're the heart, you're the approachable guy, you're the folksy one, I'm the one that's got this general please don't touch me vibe.\nIt's a it's a bit like that. I'm not putting myself on the same level of Sherlock Holmes, but in that sense, I feel like we resemble the two.\nYeah, but that's just cuz you don't want people to touch you, please. You know, you can buy it honestly.\nYeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. It's not like a put on or anything. I really don't want to be touched.\nUm, so we mentioned that there were fictional detectives before we don't have to really go through, but there were like 13 that preceded him, but Holmes is really the one that um that came along like you said and used this um scientific reasoning and and and powers of deduction and it wasn't just some dumb blundering uh criminal, right,\nuh that kind of gives himself away. And we'll we'll get into, you know, sort of why, but it's because Doyle himself was medically trained and super on the just in then the know about what was going on with modern policing and forensics and stuff like that.\nYeah. And and so because of that, he was able to like really razledazzle his audience. Like it's stuff that is just totally commonplace to us, was cutting edge at the time, like um collecting blood samples, analyzing like dust and dirt and stuff like that to figure out where it came from. um looking at handwriting, using microscopes, fingerprinting, um all these things were like brand spanking new in some cases where his audience wouldn't have even heard of or thought about this stuff.\nSherlock Holmes is employing these techniques and in the one on the one hand it is very razzledazzle like just as cutting edge as possible at the time but on the other hand too he's he's basically he's using science he's using rational science and the scientific method and applying it to solve any problem. And that was very much like part of pop culture at the time. This is prior to World War I where we showed like just how horrible science can go where everybody was all about science. Science can solve any single problem and Sherlock Holmes is the embodiment of that.\nYeah, for sure. Um we should tick through a few more of Holmes's sort of superpowers uh as written by Doyle. Uh, this is a pretty fun one that he could he could tell what a a man did for a living by his fingernails, by his coat sleeve, by his boots, by his trouser knees, by the calluses of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuff.\nHe was a a safe cracker and a lockpicker. Uh, apparently could um tell the difference between 140 different types of tobacco ash and uh 42 different bike tire treads.\nYeah. He's like, &quot;This is Virginia Slim.&quot; Yeah, that's pretty fun though. Like a pretty fun thing to write like a someone with almost superhuman I mean people have made the case that he's sort of the first uh superhero in a way.\nYeah, for sure. And um but he's again he's not he's a human person like you know what I mean? Like he is a genius. He does have Right. Yes, it is true. And I think that kind of makes Batman more accessible than say Spider-Man.\nUh well Spider-Man was real too. Yeah, but he was bitten by a radioactive spider.\nOh, I see what you mean. Sure.\nBatman came again came came across his his powers through technology generally. Yeah. Enormous.\nWell, for sure.\nBut one of the things that that Holmes was famous for too, Chuck, is is he he was able to hone in so fully on catching somebody because he he was very selective about the knowledge he took on. Um, in some cases he was just ignorant about stuff that anybody walking around would know about. I think there was a time where in one of the stories where um, Dr. Watson is explaining to him that the earth travels around the sun and Sherlock Holmes is like, not only do I not know that, I'm going to forget it now because I'm I'm very carefully curate the information that goes into my mind because I only want the stuff in there that's going to help me solve cases. Yeah,\nI would suggest that that actually could maybe come in handy with shadows and sure time changes and stuff like that, but maybe not. Maybe he didn't need that.\nYou would have been a good Watson.\nActually, Sherlock. Yeah,\nif you think about it, he's like, &quot;No, no, no, no, no.&quot;\nI feel like I really would have annoyed Sherlock Holmes if I had been his sidekick.\nOh, we both would have.\nUm, so he's he's generally um trying to do the right thing. Um, he's trying to catch the bad guy. uh he's trying to to aid the desperate uh for the most part. He protects England um from corruption. He's there was it was a time where and Doyle wrote this into the stories where there were some just sort of notorious failures of the police um not catching Jack the Ripper being one of them.\nYeah.\nAnd so he would like he would compensate for those failures. Uh and you know even though he didn't have like maybe the best personality, he was he was all about business and all about getting it done. Andy was a Victorian gentleman, so he was an upholder of the social order and social hierarchies. He he knew how to navigate that stuff, but at the same time, he was also a critic of them. Like he saw very clearly just how arbitrary and capriccious uh the social hierarchies in Great Britain were and are. And he criticized them personally to himself. He made no effort or action to make any changes to them. He just saw them for what they were, which is fraudulent and harmful typically.\nYeah, for sure. Um, we should probably talk a little bit more about Doyle. Uh, he was from Edinburgh, a town that we have performed live in. One of the great towns in uh, Scotland.\nOne of the great towns in the world.\nYeah, absolutely. I should have broadened that out. It was amazing. I had\nThere's only like two towns in Scotland, too.\nOh, come on. We were on such a good path there. Uh, he trained to become a doctor. So he had medical training and it looks like he worked as a sort of ship doctor on some like a whailing vessel and a a cargo steamer in West Africa and he was always a you know a good and talented writer. And apparently while he was, you know, not getting his medical practice uh going to the degree where he could sustain himself financially, he wrote this very first story. Uh he sold it for 3 pounds to a periodical. Uh and the only well seemingly the only reason uh he got his first novel, A Study in Scarlet, uh published was because the wife of a publisher uh at Ward Lock and Company was like, &quot;You got to publish this guy's novel. It's like it's really good.&quot;\nYeah. Yeah. And they're like, &quot;We'll give you 25 pounds for it, which is about, I think, 200 lb today, maybe. I'm not sure. I did the conversion, but I can't read my own handwriting.&quot;\nAnd they were the ones who published that Breton's Christmas annual. So, that's where it first popped up. But after it started to get more and more popular when they appeared in Strand Magazine, he started to be able to command a little more money. So he sold a dozen to Strand magazine for a,000 which today would be about £110,000 or £150,000 US. Um, and there's a thing that that he's fairly well known for. He wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories eventually almost against his will for money. He he considered himself a much better writer than a writer of pulp crime fiction.\nYeah. Um, and he wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories because he he he essentially needed money all the time, even though he was making gobs of it.\nYeah. I mean, it seemed like it's not I don't think he like um hated uh his legacy, but it definitely seemed like everything I read he was like, you know, I'm writing these other books, too, and all everyone cares about are these Sherlock Holmes books, right?\nUh he I mean, this is a little fun fact. He wrote uh the original um book The Lost World uh which is also a film in 1925 and Michael Kiteon directly paid homage uh with his own novel The Lost World.\nUh and it's basically a I mean it's not the same plot but it's it deals with people going to a a place in South America where there are prehistoric you know animals living.\nYes. And Arthur Kand Doyle was the first person who wrote hang on to your butts.\nRight. Well, apparently Kiteon was inspired to bring back um Malcolm. I think he killed off Malcolm and brought him back to life. Oh,\nyeah.\nAnd that was also and I don't know if it was an homage, but more of like well, hey, Doyle did it with home, so I can do it with Malcolm.\nRight. Exactly. Yeah. Um yeah, Doyle tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes at one point um unsuccessfully it turned out.\nAnd the reason why he had a quote he said that I have had such an overdose of homes that I feel towards him as I do toward pate de fuagra of which I once ate too much so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day.\nThat's how that's how I just sick of of Sherlock Holmes he was that it was like eating too much fuagra which I can imagine is not a very comfortable sensation.\nI'll have none of it. Thank you. Uh, one thing we talked about Doyle before in other podcasts, I think when we did episodes on like spiritualism and seances and things.\nMhm.\nThat was kind of one of his um, aside from writing these books, he was very well known for uh, being into spiritualism uh, after his son died in 1918. He would go to seances and try to, you know, make contact uh, with his son, which is super sad to think about. Um, I know that we definitely talked about them when we mentioned the um the photograph that supposedly showed real fairies uh from Elsie Wright, girls Elsie Wright and Francis Griffith and Doyle famously was like, &quot;No, this is totally real, everybody.&quot;\nYeah. The Cottingham fairies. Remember, we built a whole episode around the one thing that should have just been a short stuff.\nYeah, we've done that before.\nYeah. So, it was really surprising and shocking to Doyle's friends, his fans. It's like this is the opposite of what Sherlock Holmes would do, you know, get into spiritualism.\nBut he was tenacious. Like he was a true believer and he was friends with Harry Houdini and they were an odd pair because Houdini was a a voracious skeptic. He couldn't stand mediums. He liked to to unmask mediums and Conan Doyle would support them by going to them. And he Conan Doyle thought Houdini had supernatural powers despite Houdini saying like no these are all tricks.\nYeah. Like I'm just doing these. I'm not going to tell you how I did it, but these are tricks. Please believe me. And be like, &quot;Yeah, I I can read between the lines. You have supernatural power.\nDid you just wink at me?&quot;\nRight. Exactly.\nIt's like Castanza.\nYeah. But he was just he was just Yeah, that's a great one. But he was just It was just his thing. He could not be persuaded out of believing in spiritualism. Uh there's also been a lot of you know um ideas over his history about who like who he was based on. Was there a real Sherlock Holmes? Um the name itself\n\n\nComes from, uh, American Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. Uh, because again, Doyle was a, um, trained as a doctor. So, I guess that was just an homage on his part.\nUh, there's a historian named Angela Buckley that claims it was a Victorian police officer named Jerome Camona that inspired him. But Doyle himself says, \"No, the inspiration was a guy that taught me in medical school. He was my third-year instructor of clinical surgery. His name was Dr. Joseph Bell. And he had this sort of party trick that he would do and, uh, in, uh, lectures and stuff where he would sort of demonstrate, um, uh, I almost said Doyle, uh, Holmes-like qualities of, uh, deducing things from little mundane details about somebody. Yeah, like where someone had been, whether they were a sailor, um, if they smoked. Apparently, very famously, he once said, \"Madam, I would ask you to reveal your pipe.\" And everyone gasped as this old lady showed her pipe, and that was clearly the the root of her problem. And he just deduced it from a lower lip ulcer and a little bit, a little scar on her cheek. He could do that with everybody. So, that part of Holmes is definitely from Joseph Bell. I mean, like you said, he said as much, but Angela Buckley has a pretty good claim that Jerome Kamanada inspired him, too. If you look into Camonada, he would use disguises. He was doing police work that now today is just part of police work, at the time. He was the only one on the Manchester force who was doing this stuff. So, it was probably an amalgamation of a bunch of different people all combined with Doyle's, um, command of science, cutting-edge science at the time.\nYeah. So, I mean, on that note, we've talked about how he was using all of these sort of modern things to inspire the stories. Um, it actually happened the other way as well, which is super cool. Like, there were real, um, investigators that were doing things, uh, that they found that Holmes did in the novels.\nAnd I mean, that's super cool. It wasn't, they, they knew that there was sound science behind it. So, there was, I think, there was a French, uh, criminologist named Edmund Locar who, uh, who basically was like, \"Yeah, I, I, I like do a lot of the stuff that Sherlock Holmes does in his books because it's super smart and a good way to catch somebody.\" Yeah. And, um, there's also this instance of life imitating art that showed up in the story, \"The Problem of Thor Bridge.\" And in the story, um, the, I guess, the victim, um, takes their own life by shooting themself with a gun that's tied to a rock with a short rope, and they shoot themselves over on a bridge over a waterway so that as they fall to the ground, the gun is pulled down into the water and it looks like it was a homicide so their family can collect insurance. Well, there's no less than two people out there who seem to have been directly inspired by the story in real life did the same thing. And it turns out that it gets even more twisted because Arthur Conan Doyle probably got his idea for \"The Problem of Thorbridge\" from a case that was written about by Austrian criminologist Hans Gross in 1893, where this, this thing actually happened. So, you have a case of life imitating art imitating life.\nYeah. Well, Gross is another one of those who was like picking up stuff from the novels to use in everyday work.\nUh, like you mentioned dust, like gathering dust in packets, and Lard was telling like the police, uh, the policemen on his staff like, \"Hey, you should read these. You guys should read these books.\"\nYeah. Like Arthur Conan Doyle's character, Sherlock Holmes, was the first to basically say, \"We need to not contaminate crime scenes. They need to be preserved as they are when we come upon them.\" This is before cops were even doing that. Like cutting-edge cops were even doing it. Like he was just laying down some amazing stuff.\nShould we take another break after me saying something like he was laying down some amazing stuff? I feel like it's Yeah, we need to.\nAll right, we'll be right back.\n[Music]\nSo, we're back. Chuck, and, um, even Conan Doyle was surprised by how popular his character was, and he couldn't quite figure out why. He, he just assumed it was a distraction from everyday life. Other people have said it probably also has a lot to do with the short story form. Um, the fact that they pretty like action starts taking place pretty quickly, but at the same time a lot of the, um, stories start out with Watson and Sherlock Holmes hanging out in their sitting room, and there's like a fire burning, or it's just like, like Conan Doyle adds just enough detail here or there to really kind of make it engrossing, but then it takes off, and like we said, it, it follows that formula. So, there's a comforting familiarity to the whole thing that a lot of people make point to is like this is why it's endured for so long.\nYeah. Like a, a cozy quality.\nYes. Cozy mystery kind of thing, but then it branches out into the world of Victorian London.\nUh, so like you said, he was surprised because, um, not only surprised that like, hey, people are really liking this, um, but that just wasn't a thing there. That kind of fandom wasn't a thing. It was probably the first time that there were groups of people getting together and like talking about this stuff and forming like fan groups. Um, maybe the first fan fiction. Uh, as it turns out, uh, J.M. Barry, who was a contemporary, um, obviously the creator of Peter Pan, um, in 1891, anonymously wrote \"My Evening with Sherlock Holmes,\" uh, which is sort of the first fanfic, perhaps.\nYeah. Um, and that was kind of a good example of how he changed, um, fandom or created fandom where where readers stopped just kind of passively consuming stuff and started being like, there's a, there's a parasocial exchange going on here. Like, we own you. You belong to us. Give us more. You know what George R.R. Martin went through when he hadn't finished that last, um,\nYeah. Yeah.\nthat last book. Like that was essentially Arthur Conan Doyle's fault.\nYeah. And like you said earlier when he tried to kill, or well, not tried, when he killed them off, uh, there was a revolt. Uh, there were, um, 20,000 Strand subscribers who canceled their subscriptions.\nThey would write these, you know, hateful, angry letters, uh, of the, of the time. It wouldn't be like the hateful, angry letter you would get today. No.\nUh, I think one of them started with \"you brute,\" which is, you know, that's pretty, pretty tough language for back then, for sure. Uh, and then so he, he needed money, and so he was like, \"All right, I guess I need to write another one of these things.\" So, uh, he published, uh, \"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\" which was, uh, sort of a prequel. It wasn't bringing him back from the dead just yet. It was Holmes before he died. Um, he finally resurrected him in, uh, \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" in 1903 and just said he, he faked his death.\nYeah. And everybody was like, \"Fine, we don't care. I'm glad you brought him back.\"\nHe said it was magic, and they would have been like, \"Okay, fine.\"\nYeah. And he, but he came back with a just a classic right off the cuff. \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" is probably the most well-known Sherlock Holmes case, and it's just a, a really well-written book, and it's been adapted into movie after movie after movie. Apparently, more than 20 of them, I think.\nOh, really? I'm surprised it's actually not more. Um, there was one called \"Deer Hun von Baskerville,\" and that was a favorite of Hitler's, who's now made two appearances in the Sherlock Holmes episode. Did not expect that.\nNo.\nBut part of this whole thing that we kind of, I mentioned Doylian interpretation, um, earlier.\nThere's this thing that's a part of being a Sherlock Holmes fan. Again, in North America, they're called Sherlockians. In the UK, they're called Holmesians.\nAnd if you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, there's a really good chance that you treat this whole thing as if these are real accounts of real-life historical happenings that that are the cases of a real-life detective named Sherlock Holmes. And that these were written by real-life doctor and friend to Holmes, John Watson, and that Arthur Conan Doyle was Watson's literary, um, agent. And that they, it just goes from there. And it's really important to remember, you don't just completely take leave of your senses when you become a Sherlock Holmes fan. This is all tongue-and-cheek. It's all whimsical, but the way that they treat it is very serious. And, um, they use like actual, like literary analysis and and genealogy and all this stuff to basically tease out as much information as they can about the real-life Holmes and real-life Watson. And they call the whole thing \"the grand game.\" And it's definitely a cornerstone of being a Sherlock Holmes fan.\nYeah, it's super cool. And I think the sort of origins of that were in 1911 when a guy named Ronald Knox wrote a spoof textual analysis. Uh, and he would, you know, that's where it became, he would say things like \"sacred writings,\" and that's when the official canon was born.\nMh.\nAnd, uh, like you said, that lives on today with the grand game, and, uh, specifically the, the biggest group, I mean, there's, there's plenty of groups. There's no shortage. I'm sure there's one in your town. Uh, unless you know, you live in like the tiniest town imaginable, there's probably a Sherlock Holmes group there you could get together with. Um, but the, the most famous one is, uh, called the Baker Street Irregulars out of New York.\nUm, it is an invitation-only group. It was founded in 1934, and it seems like, you know, it's pretty hard to get in. Uh, Isaac Asimov was in, uh, FDR was in there. Um, I believe the one in, uh, England is called the Sherlock Holmes Society of London.\nYeah, and they just, they get together, they dress up, they have some dinner, and they play the grand game, which sounds like a lot of fun, quite honestly.\nYeah, I read in an article, I could not find it for the life of me, where the, the author, the journalist was invited to one of these meetings, and it just sounded so fun and so cool.\nUm, but yeah, that's I think it's interesting that the American chapter is like the founding fan chapter, fan club of Sherlock Holmes, not the British one.\nYeah. And they actually are so essentially, um, powerful that they, they actually grant, um, like official status to other chapters elsewhere. I found one called the Shaka Sherlockians of Hawaii. They were basically given official status by the Baker Street Irregulars. It's a great website. If you want to know more in a lot of detail about Sherlock Holmes, go check out Shaka Sherlockians. It's pretty fun.\nUh, well, we mentioned, um, adaptations. There have been tons of them. Uh, I said there have been over 20 film or TV versions of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" specifically. Uh, the first one, and yes, you are correct, that was a stage version in 1899 from William Gillette, where the the line \"elementary, my dear fellow\" first came along.\nAnd, uh, I mean, you name it. How many movies have there been total? Do we even know?\nUm, I'm sure somebody, million, I think a lot. I, yeah, I'm not. Yes. You bet your your sweet bippy that there's a Sherlockian out there who knows exactly how many movies there are.\nYeah. I mean, I think, depending on who you ask, taste differs, obviously, but, um, \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\" from 1970 from, uh, Billy Wilder is generally regarded as like one of the best adaptations. Uh, even though it was a box office failure, and it had a pretty troubled production.\nMhm.\nUm, it, it just brought a little, uh, wit to it, um, thanks to Billy Wilder, obviously, that hadn't been there before. And I think Wilder definitely hammered home the subtext that Holmes, uh, perhaps is gay.\nYeah. He later said that he regretted not coming out and actually saying it. That was definitely his intent, but it's ambiguous in the movie.\nAnd just reading about the movie in and of itself is pretty interesting. Um, but it's one of the reasons why it's so beloved by Sherlock fans is the attention to detail and and that's like true to the canon is unparalleled. Like no one, I don't think, has ever really done it that well. Even though the actual, like, plot and everything that's going on, the point is just so wildly outside of the canon. It's a, it's a weird amalgam of it.\nYeah. And that was Robert Stephens played Holmes in that film. Um, one of the more beloved, uh, performances was Jeremy Brett, uh, in the '84 through '94 Granada television series.\nMhm.\nUh, I, I don't really know how people feel about the Guy Richie stuff. I haven't seen those movies or read much criticism.\nYou haven't seen the movies?\nNo, I've literally never seen any Sherlock Holmes or read any Sherlock Holmes.\nWow. I don't know if the first one you should see is the the Guy Richie versions, but they're really interesting interpretations of it. Um, like they, they get in fights, like they throw, they throw fists and stuff, like Sherlock Holmes beats people up. It's really interesting, but it, it also is very true to the canon, too. So, I think a lot of people actually like it. Like even Sherlockians.\nAll right. Maybe, you know what? I have seen something because I forgot. I have seen both of the Enola Holmes films.\nOkay, there you go.\nUh, in which Enola Holmes is the 20-year younger sister of Sherlock. I believe she's like 14-ish in the movies.\nMhm.\nUh, and played by, uh, what's her name? Millie Bobby Brown, 11 from Stranger Things. And we watch those with the family. And Ruby and Emily and I all quite enjoyed those movies.\nOkay. So, you like those?\nI did like those, but Sherlock is very adjacent in those films.\nNo, for sure. Um, I'm just trying to think of what the first thing you should see is. I really don't think it should be the Guy Richie ones. Maybe Watson.\nI, I don't know. Probably not that.\nDespite the clip that I saw, it does seem to not be very well loved.\nCumberbatch. I like Cumberbatch. He, he did a modern one, right?\nYeah. And actually, um, you mentioned that Billy Wilder kind of brought like a little bit of humor, comedy to it. That got carried on by Sherlock on BBC. That\n\n\nWas Benedict Cumberbatch.\nUm, I don't know.\nI, I can't really recommend what to go into.\nHopefully some of our um bigger Sherlockian fans can recommend where to start to you because you really should.\nYou should at least see one thing if not read one thing and just see what you think.\nI like Johnny Lee Miller and that elementary sounds interesting.\nOkay.\nDo you like Lucy Lou, too?\nUh yeah, sure.\nShe and there.\nWell, there you go, my friend.\nYou're going to love elementary, I think.\nUh maybe I'll check out one of those.\nBut I mean, there's somebody in my head that I picture from a kid.\nWould that have been the the TV show?\nThe one I mentioned is as uh the most like beloved portrayal maybe.\nJeremy Brett, you weren't a kid in 1984.\nI wasn't a kid in 1984.\nNo, you were nearly a grown man at age 14.\nI was 13.\nThank you.\nNo.\nOkay.\nThat may be the one I'm thinking in my head because I just when I think in my mind of Sherlock Holmes as a as a TV portrayal or whatever, this one dude pops into my head and I bet you that's who that is.\nDid you watch a lot of Masterpiece Theater as a 13-year-old?\nA little bit here and there.\nOh, maybe that that is what it was.\nYeah, supposedly he's he is the one who did the best out of all of them.\nAll right.\nInterestingly though, Johnny Lee Miller was the one who's portrayed him the most with 104 154 episodes on that show Elementary.\nThat was a little trivia for you.\nThat's modern times set, right?\nYes, that and Sherlock are both set in modern times.\nAnd if you go back to the actual stories, they're all set in Victorian England, even though he was writing them well outside of Victorian England by the time he wrapped them up.\nWell, this all brings up the sort of ending here is that um can anyone just make this or do they have to pay for the rights or is it still in uh is it in the public domain?\nAnd the answer is it's been fairly complicated uh for for a while now.\nI mean, up until recently, that is.\nYeah.\nSo his sons, one of their widows, a producer and someone else basically got together when Arthur Conan Doyle died in 1930 and they were like, &quot;Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.&quot;\nAnd they managed to gather up all the rights to all of the Sherlock Holmes writing, the character, everything, and consolidated it into Conan Doyle Estate Limited.\nAnd if you had anything that you wanted to do with Sherlock Holmes, you had to go through them and you had to pay them whatever they wanted essentially.\nAnd they ruled Sherlock Holmes's intellectual property with an iron fist for almost a century.\nUm, and they really got a bad reputation for it.\nBut despite that, that just goes to show how popular Sherlock Holmes is.\nPeople kept dealing with them to make Sherlock Holmes movies, books, fanfiction, um, analysis, basically everything.\nAmazing.\nUm, there was one pretty famous case where uh the movie 7% Solution from the 70s from 1974 from director Herbert Ross.\nUh, apparently they thought it was in the public domain and it wasn't.\nMan, what a what a surprise that would have been.\nYeah.\nHow do you I don't know.\nMaybe I guess things were different back then in '74.\nBut how does a studio not know that when they greenlight it?\nI don't know.\nThat one was interesting though.\nI looked it up.\nUm, I was about to ask if you'd seen it, but I know the answer to that.\nApparently, Sherlock Holmes' cocaine use spirals out of control and Watson sends him to Vienna to be cured by Sigman Freud.\nYeah.\nSupposed to be pretty weird.\nYeah.\nIt's pretty interesting sounding though, too.\nBut they ended up making it.\nI think they just had to pay retroactively for it.\nYeah.\nThat's when they've really got you over a barrel.\nBut yeah, I know.\nBut the um the the copyright ran out finally unambiguously to all Sherlock Holmes stuff just this past 2023 I guess, right?\nYeah, I think uh initially it ran out in the UK in 2000 and then it was 98 in the US.\nBut there was a family argument that like no he wrote these over over a long period of time over decades.\nMhm.\nSo like the whole thing needs to go uh expire by the last story he wrote was their argument.\nYeah.\nBecause because he was so developed that like he was a flat character and really the character of Sherlock Holmes that everybody portrays is the final ones that we own the copyright too.\nAnd I think a judge finally told them to go soak their heads essentially said that what they their strategy was a form of extortion.\nYeah.\nSo they finally lost it.\nI don't know what they're doing um nowadays.\nOh I know what they're doing.\nThey're essentially authenticating new stuff so you can get their blessing and make it like an official Sherlock Holmes mystery that you wrote.\nBut that's why something like Will Frell and John C. Riley's uh Holmes and Watson could come along, right?\nThey could just do it all of a sudden.\nI think that was I think they would have had to have paid for it because I think it was from like 2018.\nOkay.\nSo even though Yeah, I guess the family won that argument then, huh?\nYeah.\nYeah, I don't think they lost too many cases.\nI think it was quite near the end of the copyright.\nYeah.\nSo, I'm sure that they had to pay for the use of that and I'm sure they lost money on it.\nWell, I wonder now.\nI mean, I don't think so far we've seen any like abomination where they've, you know, like they make Mickey Mouse a serial killer and stuff now.\nAnd yeah, uh I I I'm curious to see if they're someone's going to do like a Sherlock Holmes thing where he's the baddie.\nYeah, I'm sure some Stuff You Should Know listeners went, &quot;Wow, that's a good idea, Chuck.\nIt's a really bad idea because people would be pretty angry, I would imagine.&quot;\nYeah, you don't want to mess with something like that.\nHe's good.\nYeah.\nI mean, Will Frell's just now recovering.\nUm, I want to give a couple of shouts out.\nFirst of all, uh, Kyle, our writer, Kyle, uh, helped us out with this one.\nSo, if we got anything wrong, blame Kyle.\nAnd then also we heard from friend of the show Richard Fwall um who wrote in when we first talked about doing a Sherlock Holmes episode on some other episode and he's like yes do and listen to Steven Fry's audible um collection of all of the Sherlock Holmes canon works.\nHe said even if you don't do that listen to Steven Fry's like introductions to each of the collections.\nUm and I listened to one of them and he's right.\nThey're amazing.\nJust um charming interpretations of what's going on in these and the way the effect that they had in real life.\nUm so you can go out and listen to that on Audible.\nApparently it's 72 hours long.\nOh wow.\nWell, can you imagine?\nWe can vouch and say that uh due to our selects episodes on Saturdays, sometimes the intro is the best part.\nFor sure.\nOh, and one more thing I want to shout out.\nUm I guess you haven't seen this either.\nYou've have to see this.\nNo matter what you think of whatever people tell you to watch or read, see Mr. Holmes eventually with Ian Mckllen.\nUm, just the most artouse of the Sherlock Holmes movies.\nIt's so good.\nUm, but it's about him retired as a beekeeper, which is part of the cannon, too.\nI love Ian Mckllen, so I'll check that out.\nOkay.\nBut just put it off to the side.\nDon't make that the first one you see.\nOkay.\nUm, I think that's it, Chuck.\nGreat.\nSherlock Holmes, I'm going to I'm going to watch something.\nI promise everybody I'm going to watch something.\nYeah.\nWrite in and let Chuck know what he should watch first.\nOr read something even better.\nYeah, same thing.\nAll right.\nOkay.\nUh well, since Chuck said right, that means it's time for listener mail.\nHey guys, on the Anaconda episode, you tried to work out how in the heck green anacondas made it to Trinidad when the Caribbean island is separated from Venezuela by mere 7 milesi of ocean water.\nWell guys, I'm from Trinidad, so maybe I can help.\nWe can easily see Venezuela from certain parts of our country.\nAnd that's because Trinidad, unlike the other islands of the Caribbean, is not connected to the ocean floor.\nIt actually rests on the submerged continental shelf that extends from the coastline of Venezuela into the Atlantic Ocean.\nAll the other islands in the uh Caribbean uh archipelago are volcanic, reaching up from the seafloor, but not us.\nOurs is a continental island that was once part of the South American mainland.\nUh essentially there was a land bridge between Trinidad and Venezuela as recently as the last ice age.\nUh as such our flora and fauna are pretty much identical to those found in Venezuela and even deeper into South America and hence anacondas baby.\nUh they terrified my childhood because they uh are in our rainforest and big ones would come into town bordering the forest where uh like where I lived.\nUh anyway, I stopped the podcast mid stream to quickly tell Josh in real time your hypothesis was spot on.\nThank you.\nI love emails like that.\nUh, warmest regards.\nAnd that is from Rall.\nThanks, Rall.\nThat was a great great email.\nUh, and we appreciate it.\nThanks for clearing that up for us.\nIf you want to be like Rell, you can send us an email too at stuffpodcast@iheartradio.com.\nStuff You Should Know is a production of iHeartRadio.\nFor more podcasts, iHeart Radio, visit the iHeart Radio app, APPLE PODCASTS, or wherever you listen to your favorite shows.\n[Music]\n",
