  "cleanText": "[Music]\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.\nHey, and welcome to the podcast.\nI'm Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here, too.\nAnd we're putting on our best faces in this episode of Stuff You Should Know, right?\nOur front stage self.\nYeah.\nAnd speaking of stage, Chuck, I have a great intro to this.\nI believe it was Rush who first said, \"All the world's a stage.\"\nYeah.\nAnd the men and women on it are merely players or something like that.\nYeah.\nPerformers and portrayers.\nYeah.\nEach another's audience.\nIs that what he says?\nI never knew.\nAnd I've never bothered to look up the lyrics because there's definitely some words in there.\nI'm like, I don't know what Getty Lee just said.\nYeah, I think I'm pretty sure that's right.\nIt's a great great song.\nLimelight.\nVery well written.\nVery original stuff.\nYeah.\nUm, so we're talking about impression management today, right?\nYes, sir.\nAnd, uh, what do you think about it?\nWell, I think that I just, the more I've done this show over the years, the more I realize that I could have been a sociologist.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah, man.\nThis fascinates me to no end.\nUh, I took one sociology class in college and that's it.\nAnd I remember at the time, you know, when very little outside of English major classes interested me, I was like, man, this is super interesting to me, but not enough to pursue it.\nBut, um, human behaviors is endlessly fascinating to me.\nYeah.\nAnd one of the things, um, sociology gets beat up and edged out and elbowed in the face by psychology a lot, unfairly, I think, too.\nYeah.\nI'm not talking about social psychology.\nNo, this is sociology.\nYeah.\nUm and if sociology started out, we should say basically examining massive institutions.\nIt was macro sociology, religion, um e like economics, politics, that kind of stuff.\nAnd just how people behaved and interacted or how how people came together to form these institutions.\nAnd then the guy we're going to talk about today came along.\nHe's like, let's kind of zoom in a little more.\nAnd like you were saying, he he kicked off this um this type of sociology that that examines like people, just interactions, very small interactions that sometimes we don't even know what we're doing.\nAnd apparently um you're very interested in that.\nI am.\nAnd you know what it seems like the more I I've learned about Irving Gooffman through today's research and you know researching him a little further like he's a Canadian American sociologist and this is like the mid 20th century 1950sish when he started doing a lot of this work.\nUh he seems to me like someone who was just fascinated by human behavior even more even in a way that like other sociologists weren't especially at the time.\nYeah for sure.\nUm he Yeah.\nYeah.\nAnd he also I I read that he developed like a real sympathy for the people who were pushed to the fringes of society unfairly basically across the board.\nUh so he was not only like a really good sociologist and and uh very intuitive and apparently he had a really interesting writing style too.\nHe loved the good like turn of phrase.\nMhm.\nUm he was also like a very empathetic good person too from what I can tell.\nOh man, I'm so glad I didn't hook my hook my wagon to the wrong dude, right?\nNo, you hooked it to the right guy.\nWhen it's somebody from the 1950s, you never know what's going to happen there.\nUh we should probably say we're talking about though.\nYou um impression management or self-presentation or perception management uh is is basically these are terms that he all came up uh he came up with all of these essentially.\nAnd it's it's just how you present to others.\nAnd you know, we'll get into the the nuts and bolts of it, but how how much you might think about that, how much is automatic, how much is intuition, how much of it is authenticity.\nUh it's super fascinating to me.\nI just I love this stuff.\nYeah.\nAnd a lot of it I mean, if when we start talking about it too, it'll just seem very common sense, like, yeah, of course you're going to um you know, mind your P's and Q's and and sit up straight and uh be friendly in a job interview.\nAnd that is a type of impression management.\nBut it is way more granular than that.\nTo the point where like if you're into language, linguistics, that kind of thing, the entire purpose of a conversation is to exchange information.\nLike I know this now I'm sharing it with you.\nIf a person says, \"Thank you very much.\"\nAnd that's what a conversation's for.\nAs far as impression management goes, in Irvin Goffman and his ilk, conversations are essentially performances that two people share and do for one another that helps create a version of ourselves that we kind of walk around with and that that changes and there's very little point to a conversation other than that.\nIt's it's a it's a radically different view of things.\nYeah.\nUh, I also think it's interesting and this, you know, this is all just precursor stuff that we're babbling on about, but um you when you said it just seems like um uh instinct or whatever, would you say common sense?\nMhm.\nTo do these things.\nNot everybody, my friend.\nUh and that is something that I have gotten better about over the years.\nUm, it it used to be something that really bothered me and I would, you know, leave a interaction with somebody or something and with Emily and be like, \"God, like just social cluelessness is such a turnoff for me.\nLike, read the room, buddy.\"\nThat kind of thing.\nBut then the more I've gotten older and the more we've all learned about different neurodiversities, I've I've definitely found myself in a place where I'd try to be like, \"Hey, I don't know what this person's deal is.\"\nlike they may be struggling just to present themselves as you know passing or masking and you know we're going to talk about all this stuff in a situation to just to sort of get by.\nSo I try to really keep that stuff in mind these days for sure and I feel like there's there's different tanches um yeah there's the one you just described there's people who this is so effortless too they don't even have to think about it and they're just great basically across the board.\nThen there's everybody else in the middle.\nSome people in the middle are better at it than others.\nSome people think too hard about it and they become obvious and clumsy and um essentially though no one can escape it I think is my point.\nThere's nobody out there who doesn't engage in some sort of impression management essentially their entire lives.\nYeah.\nAnd and neurodiversity aside again which we'll talk about there are also people who aren't neurodiversity who are just clueless a-holes.\nUh and I have found too in my life that I believe narcissism plays a part.\nI think narcissists have a much harder time uh because they're generally just have their heads up their own butts and are so about the self that they are often the ones that I found if they if they don't have some sort of you know neurode divergence that's the reason why they are like they are it may be because of narcissism because you know usually the reply after someone is like read the room buddy they're like what what I'm perfect what do you mean read the room you read the room exactly so uh let's get into it and we'll start with Gooffman and where he got his start.\nAgain, this is Irving Gooffman, groundbreaking sociologist.\nUm, he started off doing fieldwork in a Scottish village and rather than figuring out how the city council worked for that or the village elders basically kept everybody in line, he just imshed himself in the village and just paid attention to how people interacted with one another.\nAnd really like um that's a very uh anthropological way of studying.\nIt was very not how they did it at the time.\nYeah.\nAmong sociologists.\nSo he was he was groundbreaking.\nAnd he he essentially went like I'm going to take this field and just put it take it in a different direction.\nSo let's go.\nYeah.\nFor sure.\nUh he wrote a book in 1956 called the presentation of self in everyday life.\nWhat a great title.\nNo colons.\nIt's exactly what it says it is.\nMhm.\nUh a very big book in the world of sociology and the international sociological association named it as the 10th most important so uh sociology book of the 20th century and in this book is where he touched on what you talked about with this sort of performance aspect of our everyday lives uh with he didn't invent it you know it was an existing concept but uh dramaturgical theory which is what you said like we're all sort of operating on a social script uh sort of like the Terminator like it's pretty limited.\nYou don't have endless options.\nYou're like, \"Maybe you should say one of these four things at at this dinner party when someone brings up a thing.\"\nUh, and even if it's a brand new situation, you're drawing on the scripts that you've used over and over in your life to to work out how to interact in the scene, right?\nYeah.\nAnd it's also Yeah.\nIt's been shaped by interactions with other people.\nIt's shaped by um what you've seen on TV, which can be very dangerous because stuff that's like hilarious on a sitcom, right, does not necessarily translate well into real life.\nIt's like you're being a huge jerk or you're not really that funny, you know, in the case of somebody who models themselves after friends.\nYeah.\nLike pull my finger doesn't always break the ice.\nWhat?\nNo.\nPull my finger always works.\nOh, okay.\nGreat.\nUh but yeah, so what what his point was in this dramaturgical theory and he like you said he didn't invent it but if you if you look into it he's basically like he's the guy who took it and ran with it.\nYeah.\nAnd no matter where you are you're performing and depending on where you are you're going your performance is going to be different.\nRight.\nSo if you're sitting there at school you're going to act different than you do at a bar.\nYeah.\nRight.\nSure.\nIdeally.\nUh yeah, you would you would hope for sure.\nAnd then if you're at work, um you know, you're going to act a little different from that, too.\nAnd it's essentially even when you're hanging out with your closest friends, sociologists believe that you're still performing in some way, shape, or form, just probably less than you normally do.\nYeah.\nAnd some think even when you're by yourself that that still informs how you talk to your little person on your shoulder, right?\nWhich is really interesting.\nUh he talked about uh appearance and like clothing even and how they will convey when and when we say actor, we're just talking about a person, but in his context of it all being a performance, he called them actors.\nBut you know, your your costume that you put on is going to convey like maybe your social status, uh maybe what kind of job you have.\nUm there's, you know, there's that outward appearance and then there's the manner in which you deal with someone and obeying the just sort of societal rules in a social situation is a big-time thing.\nAnd if you if you start to do things that don't comply with what people generally expect in, you know, at a dinner party or on an elevator or something like that, it can upset people around you.\nUm, I I think the interesting thing that I took from that is I mean that's kind of common sense, but uh when you're writing like a screenplay or something like dramatic writing or a play, uh the most interesting characters are usually people that um do things that surprise you or that fly in the face of maybe a social norm or make a decision that's unexpected.\nSo, I think it's interesting that in drama it makes for very compelling characters, but in real life we kind of don't want that generally.\nYeah.\nlike the manic pixie dream girl, right?\nUh I don't know what you mean by that.\nI mean, I know what that term means, but I don't know how it relates to this.\nOh, they're always doing like crazy stuff that like makes the protagonist dude fall in love with them or whatever.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah, I gotcha.\nSo, in terms of of a script that might be engaging even within the world of the script, whereas in real life, I don't know, a minute pixie dream girl might go over, but the person saying pull my finger at the dinner party may not.\nWell, it's funny that you say drama, too, because to me, where where my mind went was comedy.\nLike, almost all comedy is a person behaving in a way that is that violates the the situation that they're in, violates the scene and the script that they're supposed to be saying.\nThat's all from Adam Sandler to uh late Adam Sandler, right?\nIt's it's all basically that.\nYeah.\nYeah, I mean that's the basis of jokeelling really is uh is the unexpected thing happens.\nMhm.\nSuper interesting.\nAnd then one other thing too, he made a really good point.\nHe said um that the characters or the people who are interacting and again just essentially performing that they're trying to come to a common definition of the situation is what he called it.\nYeah.\nThat expected norm.\nYeah.\nAnd so like if you see say a scene on TV, it's just such a perfect analogy because that's essentially what he's talking about and there's just one dude standing at a bus stop and it's a businessman say.\nMhm.\nThat scene is in a super position.\nIt hasn't been defined yet because there's only one person and by the the entrance of the next person, that's when the scene will start to be defined.\nIf it's that guy's boss, he's gonna act totally different than if it's a a pickpocket or something like that.\nSo, the scene hasn't been defined yet, but regardless of how it ends up, like what scene it is, both are playing their role essentially that we just innately know almost.\nNot innately because it's learned, but it it becomes just second nature for most people.\nYeah, for sure.\nUm, he also thought that, um, you know, there's obviously verbal and nonverbal parts to this with body language and how you dress and all that stuff, but uh, Gooffman himself thought that the non-verbal part uh, did I say non-p purple?\nIf you did, it was lost on me, but I like non-purp.\nOkay.\nI think I might have said non-purp uh,\n\n\nwhich is basically every other color but purple.\nYeah.\nUh, he thought the non-verbal part was the most significant because it's harder to fake.\nMhm.\nUh which I think is pretty interesting.\nYeah.\nYeah, for sure.\nAnd that also like uh while you're performing, quote unquote, again, do we need to keep saying that?\nLike people know what we mean, right?\nYeah.\nI mean, we could just say interacting with another person.\nYeah.\nWhile you're interacting uh as as the actor, right?\nUh you may be aware that you have like a goal in mind, like I got to, you know, I'm at this thing.\nI got to present really well.\nOr you may not.\nYeah.\nYou you may not have a goal.\nIt may be, as we'll see, um, you're just trying to keep from freaking the other person out, you know, like you're not trying to get anywhere.\nYou're not trying to advance or get something from the person or make somebody think that you're great, but just just being engaged, forced into a social interaction like that, you have to perform a certain way or else the other person is going to to be weirded out, is going to want to get away from you.\nSometimes people get really upset when somebody violates norms and I think you can really um you can this explains it a lot because it's like um someone is expecting somebody to behave in a certain way that person purposefully doesn't behave in that way, then the people around them might get angry at that person even though they might just be being themselves.\nYeah.\nOr uh get scared, like you know when you get on an elevator by yourself and there's only one person on there.\nYou act in a certain way as a almost way to say you're safe right now.\nLike you don't you don't need to worry about me.\nI'm just going to my room.\nI'm not going to I'm not that guy that's going to be some weirdo on the elevator.\nI promise you're okay.\nYeah.\nOr even like try to strike up a conversation, like that's that's unnerving and and disarming.\nUh yeah.\nI mean, I think definitely not as much for me as for some people because I was raised in the south.\nI'm more used to that.\nAnd and definitely also in an enclosed space like an elevator, the norms are much different than like walking down the street or something.\nFor sure.\nYou know, you're trapped basically in that little box, right?\nYeah.\nYou have a captive audience and now I'm panicking.\nSo, um, just to kind of wrap up the whole dramaturical theory part, uh, Gooffman said we have our front stage selves, which I I think you referred to earlier, right?\nThat's us right now and that's what we do on our job every day.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nBut I feel like we're not that much different in real life.\nNo, I think you're right.\nI mean, that's that's one of the reasons this show works, I think, and why a lot of podcasts work is because people are their more true selves.\nBut it's also sort of the best version of our true self.\nLike, we're not the jerks that we can be in real life.\nYeah.\nAnd that's a really great point that we'll see later.\nLike, just because you're doing this doesn't mean you're a phony or inauthentic.\nYou're just drawing on the parts of yourself that are already there that apply to the situation best and presenting those.\nYeah, totally.\nAnd I said we, I meant me.\nYou're not a jerk.\nSo, I'm just speaking for myself.\nHey, man.\nI'm always happy to be included with you.\nYou I'm along for the ride.\nWell, everybody can be like that here and there.\nThat's all I'm saying.\nRight.\nRight.\nI know what you're saying.\nYou don't have to explain it to me.\nAll right.\nI was explaining it so everyone else didn't think I was just dragging you down with me.\nSo, you got front stage selves.\nEither this is when you're you're on stage.\nYou're really out there.\nUhhuh.\nThere's backstage when you're hanging with your homies.\nYeah.\nHave cigarettes.\nHome boys.\nYeah.\nHome girls.\nYeah.\nUh yeah.\nAnd just general homies.\nUm maybe your family if you get along with your family and you might feel comfortable and calm around them.\nSo that would be your backstage self.\nBut note this.\nHe's not saying frontstage self and then yourself.\nIt's still a backstage self.\nYou're still attached to the stage.\nYou're still in the theater.\nYeah.\nEven when you're hanging out with your homies.\nYeah, that's true.\nAnd then there's the offstage and that's is when it's just one-on-one.\nThis is the best.\nAnd that's still a kind of performance.\nYeah.\nThis example is just so it just nails it.\nWhen uh you you're a teacher and you see your student at the grocery store.\nYeah.\nSee him IRL.\nThat's like that's just such a jarring thing to see as a kid.\nOh man.\nAnd it's it's thrilling.\nIt's exciting because they don't exist outside of that role.\nNo.\nExactly.\nSo now you see them and they're not dressed like they normally are.\nThey're friendly to your mom or something like that.\nThey're And then they're buying olives, too.\nAnd they look like they're really into the to figuring out which olives they want.\nRight.\nSo that's just for the kid.\nFor the teacher, you still have to comport yourself in a way that's like, you know, I'm not going to just start cussing in front of the student and just talk like I I might normally talk.\nI still have to pretend or act like I do when I'm this kid's teacher.\nBut that still it's like a it's it doesn't necessarily fit the grocery store stage.\nSo that teacher's in a really weird position, right?\nThen that would be offstage interactions.\nYeah.\nUh yeah, for sure.\nI love that one.\nTime for a break.\nYes.\nAll right, we're just getting cooking everybody.\nSo come back more if you want to learn more about yourself right after this.\nLearning stuff from Joshua and Charles.\n[Music]\nAll right.\nSo, one of the uh keys to Gooffman's theory is um how important it is to avoid being embarrassed or embarrassing others.\nUh he talked about face work uh like saving face or losing face, not wanting to be embarrassed, but also he wrote about just the the your facial expressions uh especially in terms of how you disagree with somebody.\nEven if you say the words uh that you think are the right way to disagree with someone, but your face says WTF, like that conveys a confusing message.\nSo even the facial expressions you make uh have to be considered.\nYeah.\nIt's that speech plus non-verbal that equals your performance, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt's funny to see people who are trying to say something, but they're facial expression just doesn't match up.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, that's a problem I've had to work on in my own marriage with not being the mo the best communicator, which, you know, which is Emily being like, &quot;Well, you're saying one thing, but that's not what I'm getting.&quot;\nAnd I'm like, &quot;Yeah, no, I don't want to play Red Dead Redemption.&quot;\nOh, well, that's always true.\nThe opposite that is.\nRight.\nSo, the other point of that, in addition to that non-verbal use of face, you said also you're trying to help people save face, right?\nSo I said earlier that you might be forced into a social to act in a social situation a certain way just because you don't want to freak out your friend's mom who you saw at the mall by acting bizarrely or you know in a different way than you should.\nUm similarly if your friend's mom at the mall falls, like slips and falls in the middle of the mall and is embarrassed, you're going to do something that your performance calls for you to do something to help her save face as well.\nThat's part of face work, too.\nYeah, for sure.\nUh, and face work is another dramatic uh term.\nOh, is it?\nI didn't know that.\nYeah, I think face work and body work, that's all a drama thing.\nThat makes sense.\nIs there a thing?\nLearning how to move within your space.\nUh, yeah, private parts work.\nThat's awesome.\nSo, uh, to Gooffman, it's, you know, it it could be an obvious thing like if you're, you know, on a first date or something like that or like you mentioned earlier, a job interview, like that's the super obvious situation, but a lot a lot of times it's, you know, it's really everyday interactions still count.\nUh and there's a philosopher named uh Lucy McDonald who was uh writing about like um like when somebody falls down in public, almost always the very first thing that'll happen is that person will look around to see who if anyone saw them and based on that they're it's going to change their reaction.\nUh and it reminded me of that story I've told before about in college when I saw the guy bust uh bust his butt on a bike in Athens, right?\nAnd the books went spilling all over the sidewalk and this dude just opened one of the books laying on his side with his bike wheel spinning, acted like he was reading it and it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen.\nAnd then the other day on my new bike, I tried to do a wheel slide in a gravel parking lot.\nMhm.\nAnd I I busted my butt and fell.\nI didn't go, you know, ass over apple cart, but I I hit the dirt and the first thing I did as a 54 year old was look up and see if anybody saw me.\nYou didn't jump up and say, &quot;I meant to do that.&quot;\nLike, well, if somebody had been had seen me, I would have, but nobody saw me, so I just sat there and was like, &quot;Nuts.&quot;\nRight?\nSo, if you do that, like say if people do see you, you might like look back like closely at the ground like what did I say over what's wrong with this bike?\nOr you might say like, &quot;I hate Mondays.&quot;\nOr something like that.\nAnd what you're doing is something you mentioned earlier.\nYou're reassuring people like I'm not a threat to you or to the social order.\nThat was just a total accident.\nYeah.\nAnd it might seem like that person is overly self-conscious or something like that or they might be a little neurotic to feel like they have to do that.\nYeah.\nBut um but uh the philosopher Lucy McDonald that you mentioned also points out that that's actually not what's going on.\nThat everybody feels like they need to do that and that it's a rational response to the social expectations that we have of one another.\nSo, it just kind of reveals this um social intelligence that that most people have that is you don't even know that you're doing in a lot of cases and that you feel even compelled to do internally.\nLike when I do that, if I'm so embarrassed, I I will blurt something out like oops or or I hate Mondays.\nAnd um it feels like it's coming up from, you know, my gut and then out of my mouth.\nLike it it's not something where I'm like, I better say something really quick.\nIt's just a a a involuntary reaction essentially because it's so ingrained.\nYeah, because you're not a sociopath.\nYeah, I like to think so.\nYeah, I like to think so, too.\nUh, it's funny thinking about that guy in Athens that fell.\nHe he didn't even look around because it wasn't like, &quot;Oh, did someone see me?&quot;\nCuz hundreds of people for sure saw him, right?\nIt was like a crowded campus.\nSo, I felt bad for the guy, but it was hysterical.\nAnd one day, I'm going to meet that person, I think.\nYeah.\nI wonder what he's doing now.\nCan you imagine if I was at a party one day and somebody was telling that story?\nLike, one time in college, I wrecked my bike and acted like I was reading a book.\nWhat would you do?\nWould you buy him something?\nI I would hug him immediately and be like, I saw that and I've been telling that story for 40 years.\nThat's great.\n40?\nNo, not even 30.\nYeah, 30 is about right.\nYeah.\nAnd he would be like, I'm not a hugger.\nYeah.\nThen I've screwed up yet again.\nUh so I said that when people um fall and they're they're saying like, &quot;Oops,&quot; or &quot;I hate Mondays,&quot; or they're looking at the crack, or they're going through their book, whatever.\nUm they're reassuring people that that they're actually normal.\nAnd the norm in countries like the US say in the west is what's called civil in attention.\nMhm.\nTo where you ideally you acknowledge the presence the existence of another person say that you're you're on a subway with and that's where it ends and then yeah it ends there right something that I find dismaying is I see more and more that acknowledgement doesn't even happen it's just totally ignoring one another and that man that gets me especially if you nod at somebody else and they just ignore you I think That is awful.\nYeah.\nI mean, not to be old old man here, but cell phones and smartphones have definitely played a part in that, I think, because people escape into the comfort of like, well, I'll just look at this instead.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd they're just like, &quot;Oh, what's on my phone?&quot;\nYeah.\nUh I mean, if you were raised in the South or have lived in the South, then um you're more comfortable with uh more acknowledgement and maybe even a brief conversation with a stranger.\nSure.\nUh that can be very offputting for people that aren't used to that.\nUh so I I try to remember that when I am in a maybe I've had a drink or two and I struck up a conversation with someone I don't know on an elevator.\nYeah, I've done that too.\nI did it last week in fact.\nSo uh speaking of elevators, Chuck, you mentioned going into an elevator and turning around and what a violation of the social order that is.\nThe elevator is this um perfect little encapsulation for sociologists.\nNo man study because we just know what to do when somebody gets on an elevator and there's already people on there.\nEverybody spreads out, rearranges himself to make room for this person in their personal space.\nAnd it's not like we're like, &quot;Okay, I'm going to go over here, you go here, and when somebody next person comes on, you get off, and then this person's going to go where you are.&quot;\nIt just happens.\nAnd it's a beautiful synchronized effort, right?\nIt really\n\n\nIs. But, um, when sociologists get on elevators and they turn around, there's an apocryphal story about, um, Irving Gooffman doing that and studying and people just flipping out.\n\nNo, they don't turn around. They just go straight in and stand there looking at the rear.\n\nYeah. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. Um, right. Not well put. So that's actually, um, not just what sociologists like to do. It was like a big one on candid camera back in the day for a while. Yeah. And, um, there was one candid camera, um, episode where they did the opposite, where the elevator was already had a bunch of people on it, but they were facing the rear when the doors opened.\n\nOh, wow. And the person who was being, I guess, pranked came on. I wouldn't get on that elevator car. So this person, they got on and they kind of looked like they didn't know what to do for a second, and then they turned and they faced the rear. I knew it. Wow. That's incredible. Yeah. It was almost like, um, they thought that they hadn't gotten the revised script pages that day and everybody else did. So, they just needed to go along with it because they didn't want to upset the apple cart. Things had changed. This is not what they expected, but they weren't about to be the one who just stuck to the original norm and upset everybody else. Wow. Did they yell out, \"Can I have the new sides, please?\" Someone fly those in line. Uh, that's really funny. And that doesn't surprise me. And I bet the live audience at Canon Camera just got a big old hoot hoodie laugh on that one. Man, that Allan fun.\n\nUm, so there was a guy named Harold Garfinkle, another sociologist that would, I, I mean, he called them breaching experiments, but it's really messing with people, and he did things like that, like sit down on the escalator or just like point at somebody, and I'm not a big fan of those kind of experiments. No, but they're, they're all over, uh, YouTube, people doing that. I bet it's pretty funny. But, um, yeah, if you're ever in a mall and somebody sits down on an escalator or whatever, it's probably a sociologist.\n\nYeah. If not, just politely go in the other direction.\n\nWell, no. That's why you carry a water gun around with you. You just squirt him in the face a few times and say, \"Stand up.\" Super Soaker. Uh, so there's ways that we figure out how to perform because, like I said, a lot of it just seems ingrained. A lot of it requires thought, too. Especially if you're trying, if you have a goal, like you're trying to become a member of a country club, which, you know, everybody's been through that. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and these two researchers, they were psychologists back in 199, uh, 1990, Mark Leuri and Robin Kowalsski. They basically figured out how we do this kind of stuff. And they broke it into two things. There was impression motivation, why you're doing this, and impression construction, how you're doing this. Yeah. Uh, and as far as motivation, uh, it's based on a few factors. Um, one is how relevant a person thinks their image is to achieve this goal. So, in other words, does it really matter here how I'm acting to get what I want? Um, how valuable the goal is, which is, do I, this is something I really want? Am I trying to get a job or just whatever, something a little less stakes? Uh, and then finally, the extent to which they believe they're not currently being perceived, uh, in the most useful way. In other words, how much do I need to pour it on here to get what I want? Yeah. Like, how am I being perceived? And then what do I need to do to change that? Right. Exactly. So, you put all those together and that's your motivation for figuring out some impression management. Again, this is the ones where you're like actually giving thought to it. Right. Uh, in impression construction, how you actually carry this stuff out, they broke into five, um, little parts. One is, um, your self-concept, right? So you're going to base how you carry this out on how you feel you are. So you're trying, you're starting with your authentic self, ideally, right? Because people value authenticity. People don't want to just keep up a lie. Again, that's a half-hour sitcom right there. Um, because it always crumbles. It always crumbles everybody in real life and on sitcoms in 22 minutes and then it gets resolved. Right. Exactly. Um, so your self-concept is where you're going to start and you're going to kind of draw from that. Imagine a big, um, steamer trunk on stage that carrot tops going through, just pulling a bunch of props out of. That's what you're doing when you first start to figure this out. That's going through the steamer trunk of your self-concept. Wait a minute. Are you saying right now we are carrot top? The entire world is. Yeah. All the world's a stage and we are merely kerat keratops. Uh, then there's the desired identity. So you're trying to protect an identity. Uh, and you base that on what, like, um, what, what you, what you want people to think you like and don't like, or what you want to be or don't want to be. Right. So you might really try to distance yourself from something you don't want to identify with. Yeah. Like, oh boy, how about that? Uh, uh, John Legend. That was random. And all that immense talent, like, get over it, buddy. You want to be very careful with this. This is one of those things that shows what a tightrope you can be walking when you're purposefully constructing impression management. If you're in that case yucking someone's yum, that can turn people off and ruin all of the other stuff that you just did. So it can backfire. Someone opens up their jacket and they're wearing the John Legend shirt, right? Or you accidentally say it to John Legend because you didn't recognize him. Yeah. I don't know why I pulled him out. I know nothing much about him other than La La Land and the fact that he's super talented. Yeah. No, he was perfect. I mean, totally neutral. Everybody loves him. Like, it was just, that was great. Non-controversial in almost any way. Yeah. All right. He's managed to distance himself from his wife's public persona. So, yeah. Non-controversial. Who is she? Chrissy Tegan. Oh, I, I know that name, but I don't know much about her either. That's fine. All right, moving on. Yeah. So, the next one is target value. And it's basically saying, like, you, you're just going to take those things from your steamer trunk of your authentic self and you're going to adorn yourself with the ones that make the most sense for this identity that you're trying to be viewed with. Yeah. But based on what you think they want, right? Yeah. But again, this is not where you're just like, you know, stealing stuff from other people and making it your own. You're going, ideally, you're going into your own authentic self and saying, \"This one makes the most sense to what this person's going to expect or want.\" Yeah. Exactly. Like aligning yourself with someone else's values, ideally stopping short of, like, you know, doing something that's not inauthentic. Yeah. And there's one thing I think we should say at this point because it's really easy to just assume, like, this is what everybody should be doing, and I think it's worth questioning. Um, it's not inherently a good thing to change yourself or to rearrange yourself. It can be a bad thing, but it can also be a good thing, too. So just, just know we're not saying, like, you should be outdoing this. You should really be thinking about what you have inside yourself that you can impress other people with. That's not what we're saying. But people do do that, and that's falls under the umbrella of impression management. Yeah. We're, we're saying this is what Liry and Kowalsski have noticed happens. Yeah. Blame it on them and the rain. Uh, and then there's current, uh, Oh, I'm sorry. I skipped one, didn't I? Ro constraints. Uh, presenting yourself in a way that's, uh, well, that's kind of the same thing as target value, except target value is a little less that I want to align myself with what you may be into. Yeah. And a little more of just like the general expectations of a social role, right? Like you would wear a top hat and a monle to a meeting with a bunch of bankers because that's what they would expect you to do. Exactly. And then there's current social image, which is what you perceive of yourself and, um, and if other people, if you think other people perceive you in a way you don't like. Yeah. Uh, there are some other techniques that they've, uh, you know, that people can use. Um, flattery, of course, will get you everywhere. Um, ingratiation, stuff like that. Uh, conforming to expectations. That's kind of like, you know, the other stuff, I think, like role constraints and stuff like that. Uh, and then a big one is, um, like suppressing your emotion and maintaining your self-control. Like, again, that doesn't mean to be inauthentic, but that just means, like, read the room. Is it time for me to be overly emotional about something, or is it not? Do I need to kind of put a lid on that for now? Yeah. If you're triggered and you have a temper because people are taking too long in the grocery store line, um, don't push a whole load of groceries back into an aisle and shout a curse word and store them out. No, I've seen it in real life, actually. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, it was like, what, what is going on, buddy? It's hard to not think just constantly what's wrong with people. But you know what the fact is? Again, as I get older, there's a lot wrong with a lot of people. So, I try to keep that in mind. Yeah. Everybody's got some sort of burden they're carrying, and some people are, um, more vocal about it than others. I guess that's a very nice way to say it. More, some people, uh, misproject it in the wrong way more loudly than others. That's another way to say it. Um, there's also one called basking in reflected glory, which is basically like hanging out with somebody who's a great example of the kind of self you want to be identified as. Yeah. Not necessarily good. Uh, it's much better to blaze your own trail, make your own version. But I kind of, I get it. The one that's just not good at all is the downward comparison, which is putting someone down to show that you're not like them at all. Yeah, that's not a good thing to do. Uh, and again, all of this, um, convey, like, to convey all this stuff, you got to have pretty good cognitive empathy and pretty good self-monitoring. M, uh, you got to be able to read the room, read social cues, regulate your emotions. And again, I think this is why, uh, people with, like, a narcissistic personality disorder may have a harder time, may have more difficulty doing stuff like this for sure. Another break at 40 minutes in. Let's take our second break. All right, we'll be back. This is going to be a little beefy, guys, but we're into it. Learning stuff from Josh and Chuck. Stuff You Should Know. [Music] Okay, Chuck. So, um, just real quick before we keep going on, uh, it's worth mentioning that forming an online identity is essenti, it's like a whole new can of worms. Yeah. As far as sociology is concerned, we just couldn't do it before. And it allows you to do things, try on new things in ways, uh, that we, it was just impossible to previously. Yeah, for sure. But that Yeah, that's a, that could be a shorty or something on its own, huh? Uh-huh. For sure. Uh, should we talk about authenticity, though, a little more? Yeah, because again, this is everybody wants to be viewed as authentic, and just the fact that you've realized now that you're performing at all times can make you feel like you're not authentic, but we're here to tell you you're still authentic. Yeah, for sure. Um, there have been researchers that, uh, I mean, it kind of depends. You can, there are a lot of ways to, uh, um, I don't like saying skin a cat anymore because to, to tackle the cat. No, there's a lot of ways to pet the cat. We're not, we're not saying skin the cat anymore. I don't know. I mean, it just occurred to me that's a pretty horrific thing to think about. Yeah, I don't know where that came from, but sure either. I guess I can get on board with that. All right. There's a lot of ways to pet a cat. Actually, there's only one way, and that's with the grain, but anyway. Uh, how about skin your knee? Sure. There's a lot of ways to skin your knee, like a 54-year-old, 54-year-old wrecking his new BMX bike. Exactly. Uh, some people say there's a real distin, distinction between self-presentation, uh, which is like the, the influence that you're feeling by pressure and the effort that you're putting out, and then self-expression, which is your authentic self. But there are psychologists, or I'm sorry, yeah, I guess psychologists in this case, a guy named Barry R. uh, Schlinker, who says that actually self-presentation is everyone does it in all social interactions. Like, even if you're married, um, you're influencing each other and behaving in a certain way. Uh, it may not even require, like, attention, and probably doesn't if you're married. Uh, and it, but it doesn't mean you're being inauthentic if you're still doing that kind of within your marriage. No. And, um, even like within yourself, like when we did the inner dialogue episode, we, we talked at some point about how even when you're talking to yourself, that inner voice is often shaped by external forces. And some sociologists say, yeah, even it goes even that far. That's how far, um, the self is shaped by these scripts and these performances and everything that even when you're alone, you still might find yourself engaging in some performance or another. Yeah. Uh, and, and the stuff that we feel like is automatic. And you kind of touched on this earlier is maybe not automatic. You may not even realize it. This is stuff that you've been practicing your whole life. Uh, I think anyone who's ever had a kid has seen that kid, like, practicing faces in the mirror. Uh, there's some, I mean, a very tropey movie scene is someone who, uh, practices a scene in the mirror of, like, interacting with someone, like, oh, let\n\n\nLet me get that chair for you.\nAnd practicing a smile.\nUm, I mean, Nathan Fielder has a whole show about this called The Rehearsal.\nIt's fascinating.\nMan, I love that guy.\nAre you watching the new season yet?\nNo.\nNo.\nUm, is that the one that's an actual, like, it's fiction?\nNo.\nNo.\nUh, that was the one he did with, um, Emma Stone.\nThis is The Rehearsal season, which is, he sets up these elaborate rehearsals for everyday life.\nOkay, you should check out season one and then just steamroll into season two.\nIt's fascinating sociological stuff.\nNice.\nI definitely will.\nYeah.\nUm, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say?\nI know you rehearse, like, what you're doing next.\nUm, like, if you're cooking something, you've said that before, but do you ever, like, practice in your head what you're going to say?\nLike, even mundane stuff, like, what am I going to say to this convenience store clerk when I go to check out?\nNo, all that stuff is pretty innate for me.\nThat's very lucky.\nBut again, maybe innate from years and years of practice.\nYeah, it's possible.\nOr maybe you were just born with it.\nMaybe it's Maybelline.\nSo you mentioned, um, the automatic stuff that that is essentially breathing.\nLike, if you look at how it's, how Shank Schlanker describes it, he's describing the same thing as breathing, like, it's just that automatic.\nUm, and that automatic mode can be in a, like, high gear or low gear.\nAnd typically, if you're backstage hanging out with your friends, embarrassment, again, the driver here is, um, is preventing embarrassment, preventing from embarrassing yourself, preventing, um, embarrassing other people or making them feel embarrassed by association.\nLike, you're preventing embarrassment.\nAnd one of the reasons why, uh, it's easier to hang out with people in your backstage mode is because the stakes are low.\nIf you embarrass yourself, it doesn't matter nearly as much as if you embarrass yourself, you know, if you pee your pants in a job interview.\nYeah.\nAlthough the funny, ironic thing for us is, and I believe anyone that performs on stage, literally backstage sometimes can be some of the most anxious when people are sent back there, like, you know, oh, the company wants to send back these strangers you don't know.\nI hate that.\nLike, that's that's the almost the the height for me of, like, oh boy, here I got to turn, turn on the Chuck, you know.\nYeah.\nAnd I just want to apologize for the group of City Bank card holders from, like, 10 years ago who we had a meet and greet with, and it was very awkward.\nSo sorry, guys.\nWe never really got to say sorry.\nThat's why we don't do meet and greets anymore.\nIt's just Yeah.\nWe just want to be backstage with our homies.\nExactly.\nYeah.\nUm, so, uh, there's also, we, we can also automatically go into a much, um, more performative mode, uh, when the stakes get a little higher.\nYeah.\nBut either way, it's still automatic.\nSo, Schlanker is like, &quot;Nope, we're really kind of performing almost at all times.&quot;\nAnd then there was a, a scholar of gender named Judith Butler.\nAnd by was, I mean, is.\nAnd, um, Judith Butler said everything about you is shaped by, by sociological forces, including, including gender.\nThat, that people learn how to behave, um, according to what society says their gender is, um, or what's expected of that gender.\nAnd, uh, that, that's just how we learn to behave certain ways according to gender.\nYeah.\nI mean, I'm sure there are plenty of grown men who have a story where they're like, &quot;When I was in the third grade, I played with dolls and I got made fun of, and because that wasn't the socially acceptable, you know, masculine construct.&quot;\nAnd from that day forward, I started doing things to where I fit in a little more on the playground.\nAnd that shapes how they are, you know, decades later sometimes even.\nYeah.\nIt carried over from the playground into the rest of their life.\nYeah.\nAnd this stuff is all changing for the better, I think.\nBut it's still, it's not like it's been eradicated, you know?\nYeah.\nAnd speaking of gender, too, I wondered if you know how some people are just deeply offended by people who are gender fluid, like, to the point where you're like, what?\nYou don't even know this person.\nWhy do you hate this so much?\nIt made me wonder, like, if, if the person who's so offended by it is upset because that other person is flagrantly violating a social script and it's making them and other people uncomfortable.\nAnd it that brings up a further point, too.\nWho's, which is more valuable?\nThat person's authentic self that they're gender fluid or the comfort of everybody else, the strangers around them.\nWhich one is more valuable?\nWho should win out in that case if there's a conflict like that?\nUh, absolutely.\nUh, I mean, sadly, stuff like that is being literally litigated, but also the idea of changing social norms, and you know, if you're not, uh, rolling with the changes that are happening in society, you may find yourself on an island of, uh, inacceptance and loneliness.\nUm, but that may be fine with you because you may want to be like, no, things were better the old way.\nAt the same time, too, you can't change social norms without violating them.\nThey tend to just kind of stay static.\nAnd to make them dynamic, they have to be violated.\nAnd anyone who's seen the movie Pleasantville knows that that can turn out pretty good.\nYou may end up in color one day.\nMan, that was a good movie.\nYeah, that was pretty good.\nI haven't seen that in a while.\nUh, yeah, I saw it a couple years ago.\nI watch it every couple years.\nOh, okay.\nI've only seen it once.\nOh, you should keep, just buy the DVD.\nGo old school.\nAll right.\nI mean, there's a lot of movies that kind of dance around this stuff, like The Truman Show, and just, you know, I feel like this is just rife ground for comedy and drama.\nI agree, Chuck.\nUh, rife, ripe, ripe, purple.\nUh, so you know, I mentioned neurodivergence earlier and just sort of my, and, and I, you know, when I was doing this research, I had that awakening of, like, yeah, I've been much more, um, cognizant of that kind of stuff as I've gotten older, and that stuff is more, uh, in the forefront and diagnosed more and more about, like, understanding that, hey, that person that I think is, like, man, read the room, why are you acting like that?\nThey, they may have something going on, uh, neurodivergently.\nThere, there may be a genuine mental illness there.\nUh, Gooffman argued that if you have a mental illness or, um, any sort of thing, a disability, or if you're unhoused, or you're, you're obese or a drug user, that all just lumps you in as a, as a, as a thing.\nUh, I mean, a stigma, which we're going to talk more about in a second, basically.\nBut, um, and it ends up sort of creating the symptom of that thing just because you're put in that box.\nYeah.\nAnd so anybody who's, who has a social stigma, like you just mentioned, you rattled off that list, they're, uh, what Gooffman called discredited.\nThey don't have, they're not, they have less value according to society.\nAnd if you, this is where he developed that empathy from researching this stuff.\nI bet, uh, especially based on something like someone's ethnicity or whether they're handicapped or whether they're homeless or whatever, that that the idea that they have less value socially speaking in, in this, in this sense, um, is totally unfair because the social norms that we create are generally arbitrary.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nFor sure.\nUm, and, and not all cases, but, um, you, impression management is, is a, is a tool that people can use to get over or hide those stigmatized features.\nUh, I, I mean, we can't get super into code switching, but that could be a, a pretty interesting short stuff to accompany this, I think.\nRight.\nUm, that is the idea.\nAnd it's not, um, um, specific, uh, to the African-American community, but it is, uh, if, if you talk to a group of African-Americans in, in the United States today, or you know, for many years now, they will say, no, code switching is how we get by in white America, basically.\nUh, and that's the idea that you may change the way you talk when you're around white people or change the way you act, uh, than you normally would when you're in, you know, around your family and friends or your own community.\nAnd that's a, that's a big, big thing.\nYeah.\nAnd, uh, that's a great example of it.\nYou could also be like, &quot;My, um, last name sounds pretty ethnic and I want to change it so that people call me back for job interviews.&quot;\nUm, there's a lot of stuff you can do.\nSo you're not, you're covering your stigma.\nSo you're not an automatically discredited person, but according to Gooffman, you're discreditable.\nIf you're found out, you will be stigmatized.\nSo, it's just a ter, it's a terrible situation all around just to stigmatize groups based on arbitrary social norms.\nI hate it.\nYeah.\nI, I remember in elementary school, I'm not going to name her name, name because I don't know if she would want this out there, but there was a, a girl from, uh, you know, an Indian-American girl in our school that came back after a summer with an Americanized first name.\nAnd so, she was that from fourth grade till senior year in high school when we graduated together.\nAnd I lost touch with her and, uh, like five or six years ago, my good friend in Boston, um, said, &quot;Oh, well, so and so's in town.&quot;\nI said, &quot;Oh, is she going by that name now again?&quot;\nAnd she went back to her, you know, she grew up a little bit and was like, &quot;No, that is, that's my name.\nThat's my Indian name.&quot;\nYeah.\nAnd it just made me feel really good that that she reached that point, you know, good for her.\nYeah.\nIt was great.\nSo, at you know, the furthest end of this, um, I guess spectrum is, uh, autism.\nAnd we've talked about autism here and there, but, uh, a lot of times, uh, if you have autism, you might have difficulty responding in what people might consider an appropriate way in a social situation.\nAnd, uh, masking is, is a big, can be a big part of self-presentation when it comes to people with autism.\nYes.\nBut, um, there's autism researchers Amy Pearson and Kieran Rose, and they make, uh, they go to great pains to basically say masking is different than impression management, right?\nImpression management is something everyone has to do.\nMasking is specific to typically neurodivergent people to where they are protecting themselves by pushing down their actual identities and hiding it at all costs because they're afraid of being stigmatized because they've been taught over the years that that's not, they're not acceptable as they are.\nAnd so those are, those are two really different things even though they seem pretty, like, they have a lot in common.\nYeah, for sure.\nAnd masking, you know, there are all kinds of people who mask.\nWe talked about that in the, uh, sociopath episode once again and got emails from people.\nThey're like, I'm a sociopath and I put on a big performance so people don't know that.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThey're just always walking around like, I love you, man.\nRight.\nYeah.\nUm, just one note about autism, which obviously deserves its own episode, still coming down the pike one day.\nDon't worry about that.\nBut you were talking about just kind of learning as you get older, you know, that that you can't just, you can't just make assumptions about people based on their ability to interact socially.\nYeah.\nIf you want to develop a familiarity and empathy for people with autism, I think you could do a lot worse than starting with, um, Love on the Spectrum.\nAll seasons, Australian version and American version.\nI think that is very sweet because that is like the fifth time you've recommended that show to people.\nPeople need to watch the show.\nIt's so great.\nThis season in America deserves an Emmy.\nIt's a masterpiece.\nI've still never seen it.\nYou really should.\nI, I think you'd love it.\nAll right, so I guess Chuck, since I, uh, did my, uh, every 10th episode mention of Love on the Spectrum, it's time for listener mail.\nUh, hey guys, I love the show.\nThis is about popcorn, by the way.\nOkay.\nUm, just finished the podcast on popcorn.\nIt reminds me of a segment I saw years ago on Alton Brown's Good Eats, uh, Alton Brown Atlanta.\nAnd I, uh, did a little work on that show back in the day as a props guy.\nNice.\nUh, while not directly related to popcorn and Alton was a good dude to work with, by the way.\nNice.\nUh, while not directly related to popcorn in this particular episode, the show's resident food anthropologist related a factoid on Montazuma's revenge.\nUh, they thought Monizuma's real revenge was allowing the conquering Spaniards to return to Spain with maze without the knowledge of niximalization, which resulted in widespread, uh, pelagra or pelagra.\nMhm.\nCausing dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and eventual death due to a lack of essential nutrients, nycin and tryptophan in their diets.\nUh, nixalization is a traditional messamerican process used to prepare maize and other grains for consumption, involving cooking the grain in an alkaline solution, typically lime water, which then allows for the outer paracarp, the skin, to be easily removed.\nThe process significantly improves the digestibility and nutritional value of the grain.\nAnd that is from Bob.\nBob, that was a great email.\nYeah, a top-notch one.\nI'm just going to go ahead and say it.\nAgreed.\nUh, if you want to be like Bob and send us a really interesting top-notch email, we love that kind of thing.\nYou can send it off to stuffodcast@iheartradio.com.\nStuff You Should Know is a production of iHeart Radio.\nFor more podcasts,
