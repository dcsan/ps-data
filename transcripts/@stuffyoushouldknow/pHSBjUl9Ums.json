  "cleanText": "Hi everybody.\nI'm feeling very stoic today.\nSo, we're going to use what exactly is stoicism as our weekly select selection.\nThis one was released in July, July 4th, in fact, 2017.\nWhat a great Fourth of July topic.\nLearn all about stoicism right here, right now.\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeart Radio.\nHey, and welcome to the podcast.\nI'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant, guest producer Null.\nJerry's been out a lot lately.\nChuck, have you noticed?\nUh, no.\nNah, I haven't really either.\nOf course, Jerry's got big life things going on.\nShe does.\nBuying and selling houses.\nShe's like a real estate mogul.\nVisiting the mall, doing all sorts of stuff.\nUh we're just couple of deep thinkers hanging out on the Stowa.\nYeah.\nSpecifically, uh what is it?\nThe Stoa.\nDid you practice the word this pronunciation at all?\nI I tried to pronounce a lot of this um but you know ancient Greek uh you know the phrase it's all Greek to me.\nYeah, it comes from not being able to pronounce these things.\nIt's quite literal.\nUh the the stoa poili po I think that's probably pretty close man.\nSo can I start this with a couple of quick thoughts?\nSure.\nFirst of all, uh I took a I took four different philosophy quizzes before we recorded like like what kind of philosophy do you subscribe to type quiz.\nYeah.\nYou know the ones that are super accurate, right?\nBecause they can figure that out in 8 to 15 questions.\nSure.\nAnd then you can move on and find out what muppet you are.\nSo here's here's my results here.\nUh for the first one I was Epicurion.\nOkay.\nUh the second one, existentialism.\nAll right.\nUh third one, atheist existentialist.\nHuh.\nAnd the fourth, uh Nietze Stoic.\nNietze was a huge critic of stoicism.\nI'm surprised they put those two together.\nWell, that that is Chuck, though.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nYeah.\nYou're you're a contradiction in terms.\nYou're yin and yang.\nWell, I am.\nAnd that the reason why I took these is because when I was uh doing the research on stoicism, um I found me I found myself a lot of times going, \"Yep, yep, totally.\"\nAnd then a lot of times going, \"No, that's really not me.\"\nSame here.\nSame here.\nAnd I think um the even the stoics from back in the day realized that there were very few very very few actual what they called sages walking around stoic sages who really fulfilled every aspect of this to a tea.\nYeah.\nAnd and I I think that I think one of the reasons why stoicism today is is making a comeback and it's so appealing is because well there's two reasons.\none more than um kind of a naval gazing type philosophy where you're trying to figure out the nature of existence or something like that.\nIt's more a blueprint for existing daytoday in in a in a useful happy way.\nSure.\nAnd then secondly, um it's uh you can kind of pick and choose.\nIt's almost like a buffet.\nYou can pick and choose what aspects of it you want to adopt or use.\nAnd no, you know, Greek ghost is going to come along and spear you in the face with a trident, right?\nUh punch.\nUh yeah, and I think that's I mean, first of all, the age of reason fascinates me to no end.\nMhm.\nUm, and second, I've kind of wanted to cover some of the the great philosophies of all time.\nThis sounds like a good start.\nWell, it is, but it's just kind of daunting because people spend like that's their life's work, you know, and and to for us to try and summarize any of them in 30 to 45 minutes is kind of like you, you know, I don't know what philosophy you would liken that to.\nFoolishism.\nYeah.\nDun dunism.\nUh, but that's what we do, you know.\nWell, let's how about this?\nIf this one goes well, maybe we'll take it as a sign that we can tackle some other ones.\nBut you're absolutely right.\nLike even the even just like say the internet encyclopedia of philosophy, which is meant, you know, it's it's it's sharp and it's detailed and it's exhaustive, but it's also clearly meant for lay people interested in philosophy, right?\nIt's just just this just stoicism is so involved that it's not possible for us to like really capture all of it even in an overview, you know, um or giving it just hitting the highlights.\nWe can't possibly hit all the highlights.\nThere's just too much to it and that's just stoicism.\nI still say it's worth talking about though just because it's so interesting.\nSo if I get up in the middle, you're going to pull me back.\nI'll just keep going.\nWell, I like the urban dictionary uh definition.\nYeah.\nUm, stoic is someone who does not give a beep about the stupid things in this world that most people care so much about.\nStoics do have emotions, but only for the things in this world that really matter.\nThey are the most real people alive.\nMhm.\nAnd then in their little example is a group of kids sitting by the porch.\nStoic walks by.\nOne kid says something very mean.\nHey, you're a blankety blank and you blank blank.\nAnd the stoic says, \"Good for you.\" and keeps going, right?\nSo, part of me really like I hear that and I'm like, man, I am so that person on so many levels, but then sometimes I'm totally not.\nAnd I think what the difference is or what matters is well, it depends on if they say something that matters to you.\nUm, or if or if something does matter to you, like I might get really riled up about some stuff, right?\nThat well, that would make you not stoic.\nthat doesn't rile any anyone else up.\nBut I also some things that really make other people I rate I'm just like man can't change it.\nIt is what it is.\nUh and I only can get upset about the things I can change.\nYeah.\nIf you could apply that to everything, you'd be pretty pretty high up there in the stoic um pantheon.\nI'd be a stoic uh fivestar general pretty much.\nFi five finger punch guy.\nAll right.\nSo, we beat around the bush.\nI mean, that was a pretty good definition, actually, even though it was from the Urban Dictionary, but um we should say we picked that one up from a AON article, why stoicism is one of the best mind hacks ever devised.\nYeah, it was a good one by Larry Wallace.\nYeah, he did a good job kind of giving an overview of the whole thing.\nI think Larry Wallace is one of the great modern stoists.\nMaybe there's plenty of them running around these days.\nYeah, but we're uh I mean we'll we'll go back in time and study the uh beginnings of stoicism because we're talking about like you hear the word stoic today, right?\nAnd it means it was taken from this, but it it's kind of someone like sort of a grimface stoic doesn't say much.\nUm and that that's not what stoicism and they say in our article several times with a capital S really is all about, right?\nYeah.\nto these days people typically or I should say these days up to about three years ago people thought of stoics as somebody who could watch their dog get hit by a car and you know their reaction was to raise their chin a little higher up in the air you know like just grin and bear it um as Larry put it we're I'm on a firstname basis with Larry Wallace flare that it's a philosophy of grim endurance tolerating rather than transcending life's agonies and adversities just kind of trudging through um and just taking hit after hit from life as it deals deals them to you.\nRight.\nThat that was the idea of stoicism.\nYou can kind of like it's not like that's just radically unlike actual stoicism, but it's an outsider's interpretation of what the Stoics are actually doing, what's actually going on, the purpose of the whole thing.\nthat outsiders view that doesn't really fully understand it became the popular view until recently until it started to kind of gain some traction lately.\nYeah.\nAnd you know throughout the years stoicism has informed some religions.\nUh these days there are a lot of atheists that are stoics.\nUm but I like how our article says it.\nUh is above all it teaches the value of emotional control in living one's life fully.\nYeah.\nSo here's the basis of it.\nThe basis of it is if you can um detach yourself from emotional responses to things then something that comes along whether good or bad is not going to get your goat.\nRight?\nStoicism is all about protecting your goat and not letting anything get it.\nAnd the way that the way that they do that is by saying there are very few things that I can control in life.\nAnd everything that I can't control, I'm not going to get up riled up over.\nYou know, lose my job.\nOh, well, it happens.\nIt doesn't mean I'm any less of a person.\nI just need to go out and get another job.\nDog gets hit by a car.\nWell, that's really awful because I really like that dog, but I'll just go get another dog.\nOr maybe I'll just learn to live without the dog.\nMaybe I was becoming too attached to the dog.\nThings like that.\nThat's stoicism.\nBut the whole point of it is it's not just to get your goat.\nIt's or to protect your goat from being gotten.\nIt's about um living a moral life where you're a very good human being.\nAnd the idea is that the only way to really do that is through things like rationalism and um investigating the universe and being understanding of knowledge.\nand then um pursuing ethics, specific ethics.\nUm and they they they figured out the best way to do that is dispassionately.\nYeah, I think my bumper sticker would say uh on board colon part-time stoicis full-time dreamer.\nOkay, that is that is a specific Yeah, right.\nbumper sticker.\nI used to have a lot of bumper stickers in high school and now I loathe them so much.\nReally?\nWhat did you have like?\nOh, I had an old Volkswagen Beetle and uh that was my family actually bought brand new in 1968 and was passed down from kid to kid to kid and u it was it was very cool I thought at the time.\nWell, it is cool.\nI love those old Beatles.\nBut I just went through one of those phases where I was like, you know, here's a Native American saying and here's something about mother nature and this Bob Marley had this to say and oh just yeah, I was one of those.\nAnd now I see those cars with all the things and I'm just like, \"Shut up.\nNobody cares.\"\nIt's funny.\nMaybe I'm a sens.\nYeah, for sure.\nI mean, uh, did you have a 311 sticker?\nNo, this was pre 311, actually.\nOkay, gotcha.\nSo, did your mom come out and be like, \"What'd you do to the family heirloom?\"\nYou put stickers all over it.\nNo.\nIt's funny that that car had a uh the rear floorboard was missing on one side.\nMy dad had a car like that, a Malibu, so you could like see the street.\nUhhuh.\nPiece of wood there.\nNow that I look back, he didn't even have a piece of wood.\nNow that I look back, I'm like, that was extraordinarily irresponsible to be driving around with kids in the back seat with the with the street visible.\nYeah.\nI love that your dad was just like, \"Watch your feet, kids.\"\nYeah.\nEasy does it.\nUh, all right.\nSo, let's You want to go back and talk about the history a little bit?\nNo.\nI want to keep beating around the bush.\nAll right, let's get in the way back machine and we need to really juice it up.\nMhm.\nUh because we're going way back.\nGot some kerosene, got some banana peels, and got some airplane glue, but that's just for us.\nThat's right.\nCuz it's a long ride.\nYeah.\nUh ancient Greece is where we're headed.\nUh to the time of the great philosophers.\nAnd um like we said earlier sitting here on the STOA that was a joke but it wasn't.\nAnd you you you know you said stoa.\nYou going to try it again?\nThe stoa puili.\nYes.\nOr painted porch is what it means.\nAnd that was a public space in Athens, Greece.\nIt was like a portico.\nYeah.\nWhich where people would hang out and talk and chew the fat.\nAnd that's what I love about this time was people would just they were just alive with ideas, these philosophical ideas of trying to figure it all out.\nYeah, but don't you think like every once in a while you just be like, \"Oh, everybody shut up and just live.\nGo do something useful.\"\nYeah.\nPlant a field.\nTalking.\nYeah.\nNo, but I I I agree with you.\nOverall, it it it was a pretty thrilling time.\nDid you take philosophy in college at all?\nNo.\nNo, I didn't.\nUm I really did not.\nI don't think I took a single philosophy class now that I think about it.\nNot even a survey.\nI I took the one kind of general class.\nI guess it was the 101.\nAnd I actually made an A, which I didn't make a ton of A's in college.\nAnd I remember at the time kind of the same thing.\nAbout half the class I was like, man, this is so fascinating.\nAnd then the other half I was just like, h man, what a waste of time, right?\nLike do something useful.\nGo like volunteer for a charity.\nGo make something out of wood.\nAnything.\nAll right, so back to the Stowa.\nWe're we're on this painted porch, this portico as it were.\nYep.\nPeople are everywhere running their mouths about what they think is important.\nUh, and then this dude wanders up, Zeno of Cidium.\nYeah.\nWho'd recently been shipwrecked and there were other Zenos, not to be confused.\nI know that is confusing.\nThere should be one Zeno.\nThere can be in all of in all of history.\nThere were Zenos of other things, but this is Zeno of Cidium.\nAnd you're right, he was shipwrecked and he was wandering around uh after a trip from Cyprus.\nDid you say we're in Athens?\nOh, yeah.\nNot Georgia.\nNo.\nAlthough we did our fair share of sitting around on porches talking nonsense there as well.\nBut that's a\n\n\nPorch, porch.\nYeah.\nNot a Greek porch.\nUh, and so Zeno took a little bit of uh, insight from the cynics and then eventually said, \"You know what? I could have my kind of forming my own thoughts here. And uh, I think everyone else is doing it. I have my own philosophy.\"\nYeah.\nAnd it's called stoicism.\nYeah. Named after later, later, I don't think he called it that. I'm not sure. He probably called it xenoism. They're like, \"No, that sucks. We're going to call it stoicism after the porch.\"\nYeah.\nBut this is, I mean, like that the stoicism very quickly became one of the big philosophies at the time.\nOh, yeah. And it rivaled some of the philosophies that it grew out of, like Socratic philosophy and, like you said, cynicism, the cynics.\nSure.\nAnd actually, if you look at stoicism, it's kind of a compromise between um, Socrates, or so crates, as Bill and Ted call them.\nYeah. Uh, philosophy, which was that to lead a good life, and this was the point of all of the philosophies at this time during this age of reason, yeah, was achieving what was called eudaimonia, and eudaimonia is a life worth living. It's thriving, it's flourishing, it's being happy, like real happiness, right? That was a pursuit of all of these different ideas that were floating around at the time was how to achieve that.\nSocrates had the idea that you achieve that through, like, 12 cardinal virtues. And some of them were things you could cultivate in yourself, like courage, a sense of justice, that kind of stuff. But then there are other ones, too, that had, like, everything to do with luck. Like being good-looking was one of them, right?\nYeah.\nIf you weren't good-look, if you were ugly, sorry buddy, you could never achieve eudaimonia, right?\nYeah.\nOn the other end of the spectrum were the cynics. And the cynics believed that earthly trappings, like wealth and fame and glory, uh, anything like that was the path to ruin, and that the true path to eudaimonia was living simply and living in poverty. And so Zeno comes along and hears all these, and as he's formulating his own ideas, he's like, Socrates makes some sense over here, and so do the cynics a little bit, but I'm going to put them together. And that's where stoicism came from. It was a compromise between the two, where you live a life of of pursuing eudaimonia through these virtues, four virtues. Um, I think uh, there's justice, courage, wisdom, and then temperance, right? So you're practicing those four virtues. So that, that's kind of a nod to Socrates. Um, and you don't have to live in poverty. You can be wealthy. Because if stoicism is anything, it's wealthy people who got into philosophy, um, that weren't quite sure how to feel about being wealthy.\nYeah. To say, to kind of come to the point that, like, having money is not a bad thing.\nRight. Right. And so what they came up with was, um, sure, you can be wealthy, uh, and that's okay. You can prefer to be wealthy, but you just can't be attached to it. You can't desire to be wealthy because you can't control being wealthy. And if you pursue being wealthy, you're pursuing something beyond your control. So if you just happen to be wealthy, that's great. You can be happy with it, but also be prepared to lose it at any given time. And that's a a big part of stoicism.\nYeah. I, I think it's so funny though to think about, like, thousands of years ago in ancient Greece, like, they spent so much time thinking about living this, all these schools of thought of living this life. So, like, uh, putting so much thought into living to life to its fullest and all the different ways that they defined it. And eventually, like, over the years, like, as recently as, like, the generation of our parents and grandparents in the United States, like, the philosophy of life was, like, you just go to work and you work hard until you die, and that's the only thing that matters.\nExactly.\nLike all that other stuff is garbage.\nYeah. Yeah. Well, I think that's one of the reasons why stoicism is is becoming appealing again is this idea that, like, work seems to be kind of going through a weird transformation, doesn't it?\nYeah.\nLike it's not like that anymore. Like there, that, that ethic is still around for sure, but, like, how many people do you know work from home? Like, almost entirely.\nA lot.\nA lot. And that's fairly new. So I wonder if, like, this changing work dynamic is leading to this resurgence in stoicism, that you can find happiness through other stuff.\nI mean, part of me thinks this is all, like, super worthwhile, and part of me thinks, and it's sort of indulgent to, and a bit, like you said, naval gazy, and like, put, just start practicing good things instead of sitting around thinking about the best way to live life. Well, we'll talk about criticisms of them later on, but I think you hit a big one though, Chuck, was the idea that it's self-indulgent because it it demands introspection almost every moment of every day.\nYeah.\nYou want to take a break and then get back to it?\nYeah. I got to, I got to get my head together. Where's the airplane glue?\nHere you go.\nAll right.\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nNothing like airplane glue to get your head back on straight, isn't it?\nJust kidding, of course, everyone.\nSure.\nWe're smart guys. We don't do that kind of thing.\nNo, it's pretty tough to be smart and huff model airplane glue.\nYeah, it's, you're pretty much making a choice between that and being smart.\nThat's what they teach you early on.\nYeah.\nLike you want to go somewhere in life, you want to huff airplane glue.\nIt's the one thing Nancy Reagan didn't lie about.\nAll right. So, uh, Zeno got things going. Um, peace of mind that comes with living a life of virtue in accordance with reason and nature. And then other dudes got on boards and, of course, got on boards, got on board, and they were all dudes back then because everything was from the man's perspective.\nUh, just want to point that out.\nYeah. Because it's changed so dramatically since then.\nBut uh, some of the other early stoicists, uh, Cleanth, uh, Kato, Ko the younger or elder. Younger, right? Ko the Kalin.\nOh man, I forgot about him.\nI'm not sure which Ko.\nI think it's the younger.\nYeah, we'll find out from two people who email in to let us know.\nUh, Cynica, and then a very important stoicis. Uh, well, I'm going to pronounce it. EP, epic. Epict, Epictus.\nEpictetis.\nEpictet. Sounds like a vaccine shot.\nIt does. E P I C T, uh, T- us.\nIt's that C going into a T that's getting you. I think it's just epictitus or epictetus. I think Epictitus is what we should go with.\nI want another C in there. I want it to be Epictitus, but it's not.\nNo, it's not. It's Epictitus.\nAll right. So, uh,\nOh, and don't forget Marcus Aurelius, man.\nOh, well, sure. I mean, he, he comes a little bit later. He was, he was the the ruler of uh, an anant. Man, what is my problem today?\nIt's okay, man. Everyone knew what you meant. He was the philosopher king, and that was when stoicism was kind of the the most popular thing going.\nYeah. Yeah. Apparently they moved from Athens to Rome, which I didn't realize this. I always had the idea um, that Rome venerated henistic Greece hundreds of years after basically the Greek civilization had had just kind of, you know, gone into a bit of a twilight or had gone out of its heyday, right? No, there was total cross-pollination. Sure. Including some of these early stoics who traveled from Athens to Rome and basically with with that move transferred the seed of philosophy from Athens to Rome. From Greek to Rome to um, to Rome. From Greece to Rome. I didn't realize that there were, they were actually like cross-pollinating one another at the time. Yeah.\nDid you know that?\nUh, I think I recalled that from deep in my college memory banks.\nNice. Uh, so Epitus Tetus, man, um, he had a big role in the stoic movement. Uh, he was a former slave, um, which kind of makes sense in for in terms of stoicism. He almost single-handedly gives um, credence to uh, stoicism because so many other stoics were extraordinarily wealthy, powerful men that it's like, yeah, it's pretty easy for you to go through life saying, you know, it's just, just take what life gives you. If life is giving you nothing but gobbullion all the time, right? This guy was born a slave, crippled in the knee for life, and and became a stoic, one of the great stoic thinkers, and just through his life proved that stoicism can work.\nYeah. And he wrote uh, a handbook at the time was called an incoridian. And he wrote the encidian of epictetus.\nAnd incoridium literally means handbook. It means ready at hand. So uh, it was a very famous handbook, and he attributed uh, I mean, the first line of it was, some things are in our control and others not, right?\nAnd that kind of sums it all up. Like he could have said the end, but he decided to dive a little deeper.\nI agree with you. I think our brand of stoicism has about the same contours, cuz that, that right there, that's all that's everything you need to know right there is some things you can control, most things you can't control. There you go.\nLike don't get too high, too low, right?\nDon't get too mad about something.\nWell, ultimately, I think that's what it boils down to. I don't really find much of a problem when people are overjoyed. I don't think that's an issue. And technically with stoicism, that is a, that's a problem. You should not become overjoyed. Experiencing joy is fine.\nSure. But, but just being like overcome with happiness or joy or um, grief or whatever it is, you, you're, you're violating one of those four cardinal virtues. Temperance, which is just being tempered and even keeled, right? So, but I think if you're saying um, don't get upset about something that's out of your control, don't blame others, don't try to control other people, just know that whatever comes, you can handle it. There you go. That's all you need to know for me.\nYeah. And you know, I mean, how many times have you heard me say, \"It is what it is,\" which is an annoying thing to hear and say, but it's pretty stoic.\nWell, it is, but it's also in my case, like, it is what it is until it isn't. It just matters if I personally riled up about something, you know.\nYeah. But I think again though, if, like, there's probably some people who listen who, who um, subscribe to at least modern stoicism listening to this, and I would guess that they would say that's because stoicism is basically meant to apply to every day of your life. Like, no stoics are really expected to become sages in their lifetimes, right? That it's something you just do every single day is try to not get riled up. But of course, you're something's going to come along and get you riled up. That's just human nature. Stoicism is trying to put a a bridal on that human nature.\nYeah. Well, and this is insider stuff. Uh, I think you and I compliment each other because we rarely get worked up about the same thing.\nJust voter suppression. Well, no, it happens here and there, but just in our personal lives and and everything to do with work, like, often times I've noticed, like, something that'll rile me up, you're calming me down, and the other way around. And yeah, I mean, I think that's one reason we've lasted so long. Like if two people were so similar that they're constantly worked up about the same stuff,\nYeah.\nNo one, you know, you're just going to be working each other up, and no one's going to be there to say, \"Hey, man, it is what it is.\"\nYeah, man. Hey, mellow out. Here's a Bob Marley bumper sticker.\nExactly. Uh, so should we talk a little bit about the areas of study?\nYeah. All right. Well, there are three main ones and stoicism. Uh, and this is all, you know, to deal with introspection, which is kind of like all philosophies. Um, physics is the first thing. And it's not physics like you think of uh, that you hate studying in high school.\nWell, it falls under a larger umbrella term, I guess.\nYeah. They're talking about the the natural world, the natural universe, and also what lies beyond it. And and when they say the natural world, they're talking about everything. Um, God, the divine, uh, nature, everything that we know and things that we don't know.\nYeah. Everything we would view as science or, like you said, nature. Um, yeah, all that stuff, that's physics and all of it. That one of the things the Stoics, I think if they weren't the first to come up with it, they definitely popularized it was the idea that all of this was interconnected.\nYeah.\nWhich is pretty, I mean, you take it for granted today, like everybody thinks that everything's interconnected these days, you know, but um, I, it's to be among the first to kind of point that out or suggest that, it's pretty, pretty significant contribution to Western thought. Yeah, I imagine that was a pretty deep thing when it first started hitting people.\nYeah. You know, can't you just see George Carlin being like, \"Oh, you just blew my mind.\"\nUh oh. Because he was so crates.\nMhm.\nMan.\nWait, no, he wasn't so crates. He was um, no, he was the the guide or spirit animal.\nYeah.\nWhat was his name?\nOh man.\nGet killed on this.\nWe'll just edit this part out.\nI didn't know I had to brush up on my villain dead.\nI didn't either. I surprised myself. You should have seen my face.\nYou know, they kept uh, they kept talking about remakes, like, as recently as a couple years ago, I think. Or not remakes, but uh, sequels with the originals.\nOh, yeah. Like, K Reeves was like, \"Man, I love those movies. I'd love to go make another one.\"\nDid you see what, What was um, So, was Kiana Reeves Bill or Ted? Uh, why are we even doing this to ourselves?\nBoy, I want to say he was Ted.\nSo,\n\n\nThe guy who played the other guy?\nYeah, Alex Winter.\nOh, geez, Chuck. Wow, nice job. So, Alex Winter was in um, uh, what was the Charles Bronson vehicle like his most... Death Wish, Deathwish 3. Death Wish 3 was what he was in, which was when Golden Globus got their hands on it and turned it into like a schlock violent, like um, almost post-apocalyptic movie.\nYeah.\nUm, and he's great in it, but he's also in um, a documentary on Golden Globus. I can't remember the name of the, name of the um, documentary is, but it's just about how bad the movies they made were and how how gleefully these guys made them, but um, he's interviewed in it. That guy hasn't aged a day.\nNo, he looks like Bill.\nOkay, so he's Bill.\nYeah.\nAll right. So, uh, so we got that settled. Physics was done. What's next?\nUh, logic, which uh, they wanted to include um, social sciences, psychology, sociology, history, which I, I kind of like. I'm down with that as far as the philosophies go. They wanted to include all this stuff. Uh, but collectively they kind of called this all reason. And it was a very big deal, uh, to stoicism, perhaps the biggest deal, right? And they also were engaged in epistemology, which is theories of what knowledge is, how we gain knowledge, what's true, what's belief, what's false, how do we differentiate between these things. And they spent a lot of time investigating this and putting it all under logic because it was through logic that you could investigate physics, which included investigating God and the nature of universe and stuff like that. And then through all that that investigation, that introspection, that naval gazing, um, you were ultimately figuring out how to best pursue and best live out the third part, which was the ethics of the whole thing.\nYeah. And you mentioned the the four great virtues earlier: courage, justice, wisdom, and temperance. And um, the whole idea here is uh, it's it's not like you want to block out the bad and only embrace the good. You like you want to consider both the good and the bad, but just don't let it, any of it, get in the way of anything that you're trying to pursue in your life, right? Pretty simple.\nYeah, and the whole good, bad thing, where did you find this, this thing on ethics? Was that the...\nThat was the internet encyclopedia of philosophy from their, from their uh, entry on it was pretty, pretty good, the whole thing. Dude, you should have seen how in-depth they go though. But I thought this one was a good snippet.\nWell, I'm sure. Yeah, they dive pretty deep, but I thought this was a pretty good little summation there. You know, they were talking about um, like you said, like money isn't just not good or aka bad. Uh, things like this they called indifference, as in uh, I N D I F F E R E N T S, right?\nNot indifference. And it's like not good or bad. It could be either one. Um, it, it's really kind of all about not letting something like that get in the way of your pursuit, right? So, and again, it went back to wealth, right? And this um, this person in the encyclopedia of philosophy points out that like money definitely, being wealthy usually is, is helpful or beneficial to the individual.\nSure. But you, it can also not be beneficial where, say, you have a big heroin problem. Well, the more money you get, the more money you're going to spend on heroin. So in that case, being wealthy is detrimental to you, not beneficial. Right? And for something to be a good, it has to be good under all circumstances. And to a stoic, only, there's only four things that are good under all circumstances, which are those four cardinal virtues. Right. Everything else, like you said, is an indifferent. And it can either be preferred or dispreferred. Like wealth typically would fall under being a preferred indifferent. Whereas, say, disease, having chronic disease would be a dispreer, disper.\nWow.\nA dispreferred indifferent.\nMan, that's tough though.\nIt is. Um, but the the point is is whether it's fabulous wealth or diabetes, they should affect you about the same. Or you might want one, you might not want to have one, but if you have either one, you can live with it. And that brings up a huge, huge component of stoicism that's really been blown up and exploded in the 21st century, which is you should take adversity and turn it into a an opportunity for growth. That is a huge aspect of stoicism that's that's really being practiced and espoused these days.\nYeah, I'm down with that.\nLike I don't, I don't think I like being able to take from all these philosophies and different religions to form your sort of uh, pathway through life, you know.\nSure.\nLike when I hear sometimes, I, I've started to read about Buddhism and and the whole thing with Buddhism of like, every day you start a new and you have a new chance, like that really appeals to me too, right? What I don't like is uh, when either religions or philosophies say like, no, like this is the only way and everything else is BS.\nSure.\nYou know.\nYeah.\nThat just, that's a harsh buzzkill.\nIt really is. Not only is it BS, but I'm going to kill you for thinking otherwise.\nYeah. So Senica, who was one of the great thinkers uh, of stoicism, he was an adviser to Nero, and we'll talk about him as criticism of stoicism later on, but he had a um, very famous quote where he says, \"You are unfortunate in my judgment, for you have never been unfortunate. You have passed through life with no antagonist to face you. No one will know what you are capable of, not even yourself.\" And that kind of shapes the, that the basis of that idea that no matter what life throws at you, you take it and you say, \"I'm going to become a better person from this.\" Like, \"Oh, this happened.\" Well, that's great because that means that I can learn to be better at this. So, my dog just got hit by a car. I'm going to practice um, fortitude and make it through this really hard time and become a stronger person on the other side.\nYeah. He may as well have said, \"You trust fun kid,\" sure. Right. Exactly. And and I mean that, that, that makes a people turn that on Synica as well, but a lot of modern stoics come to his defense is like, \"No, that guy had a harder life than you would think.\"\nShould we take another break?\nYeah. All right, let's do it. And we'll talk about Senica and Cicero and all other kinds of weird names.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nSo Chuck, you were saying you were talking about um, religion.\nStoicism apparently informed Christianity in a lot of ways.\nYeah. And Buddhism in some ways.\nYeah.\nYet atheists embrace it.\nIt's kind of weird that way these days. But I mean, the early Stoics were definitely, they definitely believed in a divine intervention. And it was kind of the basis of the whole thing that this is God's will, so why, why try to control it? Who are you to try to control it? Just roll with the punches.\nYeah, that's a big, when, when I was taking all those philosophy quizzes, they're all a little bit different, but you saw a through line through a lot of these questions and uh, the free will one was in every single one of them.\nYeah.\nLike how do you feel about free will?\nAnd hey, there different ways of asking it, but you know that free will. What do you think?\nIf, exactly, if you want to find out which philosophy that you jive with, uh, you have to answer the free will question.\nFree will question.\nYeah. Hey, that's easier to say than dispreferred indifferent.\nNice work.\nSo, um, so one of the big points, especially today, for practicing stoicism is looking at adversity as a grow opportunity for growth.\nRight. That's just a good tool in life, I think.\nAnother one, and this one I really, this is where I big time diverge from stoicism as like a part of a daily practice, is something called negative visualization.\nYeah. Like uh, try and try and imagine the worst case scenario constantly.\nYeah. I'm not into that at all.\nNo. So say you're, say you're at like your child's birthday party, right? And you are not you specifically. This is you, just a general person, and you're having just the most intense moment of of joy and appreciation for your child. According to Stoics, you should follow that up with a thought about how at your child's next doctor's appointment, your child could be diagnosed with terminal leukemia.\nYeah,\nthat, that is what you should be doing basically all the time. Negative visualization. And the idea is it's twofold. One, you're preventing yourself from becoming overjoyed at that moment, right?\nDon't, don't do that.\nYeah. Yeah.\nAnd then secondly, you're, you're exploring how you will feel if your kid does get diagnosed with something horrible or something bad happens. And that when it actually happens, you'll say that it's not so bad. I'm already used to it. Or you'll be able to confront it through your imagination and say, \"This is what I'm afraid of. That's not that bad.\" But I mean, that's a really extreme, horrific example. Yeah. But, but it is ultimately, it's definitely in step with stoicism that you should be visualizing the worst case scenario all the time.\nYeah. Yeah, I mean, and that's one of the reasons stoicism has such a downer reputation, uh, such that Cicero uh, wrote uh, a stoic rouse enthusiasm. He is much more likely to extinguish any enthusiasm the student may have to begin with, burn. Yeah, it was a pretty good burn. Um, and you know, I get that, like, who, who would, if you, if that was one of the first things you learned, if you started to poke around with stoicism, uh, 99% of people would probably be like, \"Man, I don't want to, I don't, I don't like the sounds of that.\"\nYeah, I like the not having to control everything aspect, but the thinking about nothing but negative thoughts all the time. Yeah. You know, and I, I get the point of it. I just, it doesn't, it doesn't appeal to me. No, I mean, you shouldn't be polyiana either. Um, well, no, it's, it's in direct contradiction to the idea of the power of positive thinking, right?\nWhich is Stoics like, \"You fool, what are you doing?\" All you're doing is setting yourself up for nothing but letdowns when that doesn't actually come true.\nWell, but I also agree with that to a certain degree, you know, like the whole, like just you can conjure it up just by thinking positively. I think that's on the opposite side equally, uh, BS.\nSure. Sure. I think so, too.\nI'm kind of right down the middle, I guess, when it comes to that stuff.\nAnd I think most people are, but I think that's what's fascinating about this kind of thing is it's like, \"Whoa, there's are some people actually are to these, these degrees, these extremes.\"\nIt's interesting to me.\nWell, yeah. And the other interesting thing is we, you know, you're talking about Christianity, and then it's weird how stoicism on one hand, like atheists, like I can totally see how they'd be down with stoicism, but also the whole notion that uh, some believers in God and some Christians like, give it all up to God because only God can control anything. So uh, all we're going to do is is pray about it. And that's popular among stoics as well, right? So, it's just interesting that it has such a wide range as far as from atheism to like the, you know, serious, serious give it up to God Christianity, right? Yeah. No, it definitely, yeah. And it almost, it's kind of like it's that buffet thing again where people can come along and take what they want from it and it, it becomes part of their own philosophy or their own religion or whatever. Um, let's talk about some of the ways that that it's been used over the years.\nStoicism, right?\nOkay.\nSo, there have been a lot of people who have followed stoic thought, like Adam Smith, apparently um, was very much informed by stoicism when he wrote the wealth of nations because one of the big, big aspects of it was individual liberty. One, one cool thing about the early Stoics was that everybody's equal.\nYeah.\nRight. Doesn't matter whether you're man, woman, uh, gay, straight, uh, black, white, whatever. Everyone is equal. And this was at a time when slavery was rampant, right?\nYeah.\nUm, so that was a big, a big, that's a big aspect to um, that's a big aspect of the wealth of nations is anybody can come along and and become a capitalist. You just have to compete, right? Um, another place that it popped up kind of famously was in cognitive behavioral therapy.\nYeah. Which initially when I saw that, I was like, \"Huh, that kind of surprised me.\" But then it all made sense, right? Like exposure to something bad can help you get over it is kind of like that uh, conjuring up the worst possible. It's almost numbing yourself to the worst possible thing if you think about that.\nY\nuh, worst case scenario thing all the time. It's almost a way of preparing for that.\nYeah. And and it's rooted specifically, the one of the founders of CBT, Albert Ellis, um, was an adherent of um, of stoicism as a younger man, and the, the what's known as the cognitive model of emotion, which is the basis of cognitive behavioral therapy, is based on Epictitus's um, maxim that people are disturbed not by things, but by their view of things, and and that's part of that whole stoic philosophy, which is nothing is good or bad. There's only good in the four virtues. Everything else is how you view it. Whether it's losing your job or winning the lottery, those aren't, those things aren't inherently good or bad. It's you, the person experiencing that, who bestows good or bad on them.\nYeah.\nAnd why label things?\nSure, I'm down with that.\nYeah,\na little bit.\nDid you hear about Admiral Stockdale?\nYeah, I remember that name uh, for sure when he came out with his uh, with his book uh, Courage Under Fire Colon testing Epictectus' doctrines in a laboratory of human behavior in 1993. He was a famous um, prisoner of war uh, in Vietnam for seven years. Endured some of the worst of the worst that you can imagine in war. And what got him through uh, was certainly not Christianity because he thought that's nothing but false hope.\nWell, not, not only that, he shared the P camp with\n\n\nPeople who clung to that and did not make it.\nYeah.\nSo he saw it like right up front, right?\nSo what got him through was his stoic beliefs.\nYeah.\nHe was a huge, big-time adherent of Epictitus.\nUm, he'd studied him in college.\nApparently, he'd read everything that Epictitus had written or said that had been written down and attributed to Epictitus twice from two different uh translators.\nSo, this guy knew his Epictitus.\nAnd he said, \"Well, I'm a prisoner of war in Vietnam.\nI've got some broken bones.\nI'm starving.\nI'm being mistreated.\nI'll be here for seven years.\nWhat a perfect opportunity to put Epictitus' teachings to the test in a real life laboratory experiment.\"\nAnd he said, Epictitus passed with flying colors was was Stockdale's final report on it.\nYeah.\nHe said, uh, if Epictitus' lecture room was a hospital, my prison was a laboratory, a laboratory of human behavior.\nI chose to test his postulates against the demanding real life challenges of my laboratory.\nSo, man, talk about a strong will like to be faced with that and be like, well, hey, this is a great chance to to work on my philosophy of life.\nExactly.\nWhat else am I going to do?\nBut that that follows in and of itself on the whole too of um turning adversity into a room for growth as well.\nYeah, man.\nYeah.\nStronger than me.\nLet's just say that.\nSo, um, you want to talk about some criticisms of stoicism?\nWell, Cicero certainly thought it was a big downer.\nYeah.\nUm, he said, well, you already said what he said, right?\nYeah.\nThat it basically extinguishes enthusiasm in students.\nNot a good thing, right?\nAnd then over over the years, the fact that some of the great stoic thinkers of all time have been super wealthy and powerful.\nSeneca, Marcus Aurelius was the emperor of Rome.\nHe basically ran the free world.\nWell, I don't know if the free world's right.\nThe western world for almost 20 years.\nYeah.\nAnd and when you sit there and Yeah.\nAgain, if you say yes, you can turn anything into any adversity into an opportunity.\nIf if you're super wealthy, you don't have to worry about where your food's going to come from.\nLike yes, of course you can be a stoic.\nAnd then Epictitus came along and and like we said, kind of erased all of that to an extent for sure, but it is still kind of criticized as like a a wealthy person's philosophy.\nAnd it kind of smacks of that a little bit today too, Chuck, with its huge um resurgence in Silicon Valley.\nOh, is that happening?\nOh, yeah.\nMost most of the stoic revival is taking place there.\nThat's where its cradle is right now.\nOh, well, our own article has a couple of good points that talk about it um not being as appealing because it it lacks the mystique of Eastern practice.\nUh and then they uh also said this, it's also regarded as a philosophy of merely breaking even while remaining determinedly impassive.\nYes.\nI don't know if that's entirely fair, but it's a it's it kind of catches it a little bit.\nWell, yeah, because the the very next sentence is this attitude ignores the promise profered by stoicism of blasting transcendence.\nAnd that one article that you sent talked about the power of indifference, right?\nWhich I thought was interesting.\nIt's not about just like not caring about anything.\nIt's about caring about only the right things that you have the power to change.\nYeah.\nAnd also though I also see that even keel aspect being indifferent the power of it.\nI mean think about how much time whenever you you are like super happy about something going right or super upset about something going wrong.\nYou're ultimately you're being distracted from keeping on keeping on.\nOh yeah.\nAnd then you go back to eventually get back to that middle again which is the baseline anyway.\nAnd so I guess what Stoics are doing is staying on that that baseline and not being distracted so they can get further along faster or at a more steady pace.\nYeah.\nI mean, there's definitely something that's really frustrating in life, which is when you look back and say, \"Man, I've spent two days stressed and worried about something that I have no control over, right?\nAnd what a waste of time that was when I could have done X, Y, and Z.\nOne of the big questions I have, it's not necessarily a criticism.\nI guess it depends on what the answer would be, but my one my big question for stoicism since it's so um it places so much emphasis on the individual and self-exloration and introspection.\nHow would a stoic suggest enacting massive social change where something some ill is happening to some large group of people, but nothing's going to change unless you go out of your own personal sphere and work to make others change, right?\nHow do you do that?\nDo you just say, \"Well, whatever.\nit's God's will that these people suffer and be put down by the majority for forever or is there some way that that can be addressed through the stoic, you know, philosophy?\nI'm very curious.\nSo, anybody who knows that, write in, please.\nYeah, maybe that's why it appeals to Silicon Valley.\nRight.\nWell, that's the other thing, too.\nRight.\nSo, it also very much smacks when when you hear of it from like wealthy people espousing it to anybody.\nUm, it smacks of that whole uh aspect of Christianity where hey medieval peasant, you know how your life is terrible and you're going to live to 35 and all you do is work all the time and you give most of the the spoils of your effort to your king.\nWell, there's such thing as Christianity and your treasure is in the afterlife.\nSo don't worry about this life, right?\nIt's smacks of the same thing where you can keep a population placated and not searching for larger social change by saying, \"Hey, just focus on these four things and everything else is just it just happens and you don't need to get worked up about it at all.\"\nIt seems like a a bit of a pacifier, too.\nYeah.\nDepending on how you look at it, it's it's fascinating.\nAre we done with stoicism?\nI'm finished with it.\nOkay.\nI think that was a good overview.\nI think so, too.\nIt's a good thought starter.\nIf you uh want to know more about stoicism, bud, there's a lot more out there than this.\nJust dive in and see what it means to you.\nAnd again, it's a buffet.\nTake what you like, leave what you don't want.\nLeave the curdled pudding behind.\nCorrect.\nTake the perfectly garlicked green beans.\nYum.\nIf uh what else did I Did I already say that one part?\nOh, since I said green beans, it's time for listener mail.\nUh, I'm going to call this uh Beagle Brigade/ Police Dogs.\nPeople love that one, man.\nWho doesn't love Beetles?\nBeagles on brigade on parade.\nNo one.\nEven people who get busted with whole pigs still are like, \"That beagle's adorable.\"\nSo, uh, this dude, uh, Eric Stove is a sandwicher, meaning he follows our advice, which is to listen to the newest episode as well as whatever from our back catalog he chooses to.\nYeah, he's doing it right.\nListen.\nYes.\nUh, hey guys, I work in the sports and entertainment business in New York.\nAnd after 9/11, the use of bomb sniffing dogs, mostly uh, German Shepherds, became standard operating procedure for all events.\nA few hours prior to a concert one night, the K9 units were sweeping all the backstage areas and one of the bomb dogs hit on an employee locker.\nAs you can imagine, it caused an immediate and serious response.\nA bomb squad was dispatched and that portion of the arena was evacuated.\nPlans were even made to cancel the show.\nUh he doesn't say what show, which I was very curious about.\nI'm going to say Three Doors Down.\nOkay.\nUh after some very tense moments, the police officers open the locker.\nThose guys are super brave.\nUh thankfully they didn't find a bomb, but did find drugs.\nAn employee must have thought uh must have brought in an extra bump for the show.\nOh man, it was definitely Three Doors Down.\nUh you might be asking yourself, um No, this wasn't the band's green room.\nThis was an employee.\nOh, I know.\nI know.\nThree Doors Down.\nThree Doors Down's fans are among the most drug add of all music fans.\nAre they?\nSure.\nI thought that was the Jugalos.\nNo, they put the jugalos to shame.\nJugalos take time off once in a while.\nYou know what I mean?\nYeah, that's true.\nUh, you might be asking yourself, how does a bomb dog find drugs?\nAs it turns out, the dog had failed out of drug school and was retrained as a bomb dog.\nPoor guy.\nThat's hilarious.\nPoor guy.\nWhich one?\nthe dog or the guy who just happened to run across the failed drug dog.\nYeah, I guess they're still remembered something.\nThere are no winners here.\nUh I guess he didn't completely forget his drug training though and he set off a chain of events that scared the crap out of us.\nUh the story ends with the employee getting arrested.\nThe show went on and the fans none the wiser and my guess is the dog was reassigned uh to uh crowd control just barking at people.\nGet back in line.\nUh thanks for everything you guys do.\nPlease let me know if you ever need anything in New York City.\nUh, is that a hint?\nWe don't do drugs, Eric.\nYeah, we're terrified of dogs.\nUh, that is Eric Stove in New York.\nAnd I guess he's still in the sports and entertainment business.\nYeah, he's like, \"You need some sports, come see me.\nI could use some sports.\"\nThanks, Eric.\nThat's a pretty great story, right?\nThat's right.\nIf you want to get in touch with us
