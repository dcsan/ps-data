  "cleanText": "Hi everybody, Chuck here with another intro for our Summer Movie Playlist. Right now you're about to listen to how Steadicams work. Uh, this one goes all the way back to June 2016, but this was a pretty good one, everybody, because the Steadicam is one of movies' uh, great inventions, quite honestly. Uh, first used in some of the early movies like Rocky and The Shining. We're going to talk about how it was made, how it works, and how it works best. So check it out right now.\n\nWelcome to STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW from howstuffworks.com.\n\nHey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. Jerry's over there. Chuck's wearing a hat. So, it's STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW.\n Yeah.\n Still, still pretty sad.\nYeah.\n Are you really?\n Sure.\n Oh, RIP.\n You know what? I'm getting the uh, Josh is referencing my last chance garage hat that I've talked way too much about. Um, I'm getting the patch remade as we speak.\n Whoa. I actually found one on eBay that had been sold like three months ago and it's all a big conspiracy.\n Is that right?\n No, not, but I found a picture of the patch that I sent to a patch maker who like can digitally reproduce this thing.\n Nice, man. Well, then I got to find the right hat.\n It's coming back home. Well, that's step one.\nAnd that's a big step one.\n Yeah, I'm getting a few patches and a few hats this time.\n I think that's a good idea.\nYeah, you can name them one through eight.\n That's right.\n Uh, let's see. Chuck, you worked in the uh, film industry previously.\n Yeah. So did you technically?\n Yeah. Um, you did more than I did by far. You worked in front of and behind the camera.\n That's right.\n Um, did you ever work with a Steadicam at all?\nYeah.\n So like you've seen these things up close?\n Yep. I don't recall Scott or anybody using one.\n We did not have one on our show.\n Okay.\n They're expensive.\nOkay. But I mean, there was some pretty good equipment on set it seemed like to me.\n But there was no Steadicam, right?\nNope.\n Cuz I was trying to recall and I could not for the life of me remember a moment when there was a awesome like extendo arm camera with like all of the components exploded out into different parts of a pole.\n That didn't happen because he would have walked in and said, \"What's that?\"\n Right? And everyone would have laughed and you would have been like, why does everyone make fun of me? Just you don't know all this stuff. I'll be in my dressing room.\n Uh, no, we never use one on our uh, TV show for Science Channel because like I said, it's pricey to rent. Um, and this is a bit of a giveaway, but a person Steadicam operator comes with the package, right, with all the equipment. It's a lot of times their own. And uh, it's, you know, it's pricey, yeah, to pay for that lady or that dude. Right.\nBut the reason it is pricey is because it's it has a really good effect.\n Yeah.\n And uh, the person who's doing it really knows what they're doing.\n Yeah.\n I, I, I don't know, but just from researching this, it seemed like they were probably the most skilled tradesperson on the set at any given time when they were on the set. Is that right?\n Well, I think it's just a matter of what skill. Uh, it's just a different skill.\n Are they like the highest echelon of camera operators? No, it's just different.\nOkay.\n Like a top-notch.\n They're niche.\nYeah.\n Okay, I got it then.\n But, but you don't just wade into Steadicam and and start getting work the next day. It does take a lot of work to master. But like a good dolly grip uh, is just as skilled, right, at just pushing that thing around. But that takes a very non-herky-jerky.\n Well, it's not gonna be herky-jerky anyway, but just uh, to hit the marks right and\n Oh, I see.\n Yeah. I mean, all that stuff takes a great amount of skill. Well, let's talk about this because Steadicam, you know, when I came of age was already invented. It was, it was basically became commercially available the year I was born. So, I don't really know a world prior to Steadicam. I've never seen a movie that came out before 1976.\n Funny.\nAnd um, I'm just used to it, right?\n Yeah.\nBut it's, it's, it's interesting to to look back and see that there, there actually is a point in time where this one dude who was actually kind of an outsider of the movie business, um, basically changed it permanently forever.\n For sure.\n Yeah.\n Uh, his name was Garrett Brown. Is Garrett Brown?\n Yeah.\nHe's still around, right?\n Yeah. And he um, he was working uh, for, well, he was working in TV commercials in on Sesame Street in Philadelphia.\n Yeah. And um, he got a little frustrated as camera people do uh, pre-Steadicam with not being able to accomplish certain shots.\n Yeah.\nThere's supposedly there were 30 impossible shots that just based on the the equipment at the of the day you just couldn't do, right?\n Yeah.\n And a lot of it had to do with like rough terrain.\n Sure.\nStaircases were a big one.\n Yeah. And the reason these shots were impossible, it's not like you couldn't lug a camera around up and down the stairs. But the movement that the camera recorded would be so jarring that it would render the film like that, that it would be unusable.\n Yeah. And this was in a day before, I mean, there were shaky cam shots and like Cvetes and all these early indie filmmakers did a lot of like avant-garde handheld stuff, but it was known as avant-garde, right? Because it looked different and people were used to kind of smoother looking things in mainstream movies at the time.\n Yeah. It had like a real frenetic energy to it.\n Yeah. Which you see all the time now. It's like a bonafide thing.\n But and it wasn't just like picking up the movements of the the camera. It was like telegraphing them as far as the human brain's concerned because we take it for granted. But we have in our own brains a a pretty complex system. Yeah. That involves the inner ear coordinating with the um, movement of the retina so that it offsets the movement and the motion and the jarring um, impact of like just walking.\n Yeah.\n Like if we didn't have that, we wouldn't be able to focus on anything while we were moving around.\nYeah. You wouldn't, people wouldn't jog. They would get sick and vomit every time they jog.\n Exactly. Right. And you certainly wouldn't be able to like read US magazine while you were jogging or something like that. The fact that you can, it really is a, it really shows how incredibly complex and well-developed the system is, right?\n Yes.\n That's what the Steadicam that Garrett Brown um, created sought to recreate and he, he did it. He nailed it like on the first time out basically.\n Yeah. Because we, we mentioned a dolly. That is um, people that know film know this stuff is like pretty rudimentary information, but a lot of people don't know what a dolly is and they see the word dolly grip in a movie. They just think it sounds funny. Um, but the dolly is how you typically would get a smooth shot. It's just a big super, super heavy sled with wheels, right, that the camera sits on and the camera operator sits on and it's either on a very smooth floor or it's on a piece of track like a little railroad car and it pushes along and that's how you get those nice smooth shots.\n Right.\nSo, that's a dolly. The problem with the dolly is is you can't really lay that track over um, a rocky terrain if you're filming on Mars or something like that.\nNo. Like you said, you can't uh, push it up and down stairs. It just had its limitations, right? It did. So Garrett Brown said, \"I'm sick of these limitations. I'm so tired of being limited by dolly, stupid dollies. I'm going to invent something better.\" And so he tinkered around um, with his what was called the Brown stabilizer at first.\n Yeah.\n Which he later renamed to the Steadicam.\n Yeah. And to show off. Um, like at first he, he was just using them in commercials and he was like, \"This is way bigger than just commercials.\"\n Yeah.\n I'm going to make a sizzle reel. And he made a sizzle reel of the 30 impossible shots that you just couldn't do before. And he did it with the Steadicam, but he didn't show how it was done.\n Yeah. And you can um, he was able to save 10 of those shots uh, and digitize them. And a couple of years ago, he finally released online 10 of those. So, you can actually go see this original reel.\n Yeah, it's pretty cool.\nSee uh, his wife and his best friend like just doing stuff while just doing stuff.\nLike, you know, like one of them was um, swimming. You can't run alongside somebody swimming apparently was an an impossible shot. I'm not quite sure why.\nWell, you just couldn't run alongside someone doing anything.\n Oh, okay. That's what it was. Even with a dolly.\n Uh, well, no. You could have, you could have laid dolly track down the length of a swimming pool. Sure.\n Right. That's why I didn't understand that one was an impossible shot.\n Um, but to show off, he goes, he goes around a um, a slide just to kind of show, maybe that was the impossibility of it.\n But then his buddy gets out of the pool and like walk and like he's, he pivots around him and I'm sure he, when he put this reel together and he sent it out, the directors are like, uh, this is magic sorcery. Well, it was mind-blowing and some people say it was the first uh, viral video because it was shared around Hollywood literally in a matter of days. Everybody in Hollywood was saying, \"What in the world, like you said, what is this sorcery, right, this Garrett Brown has bestowed upon us?\"\nYeah, it's, it was a a bit of a mic drop as far as the reel goes. And Stanley Kubri being Stanley Kubri sent a message uh, to G. Brown that said, \"If you are really concerned about protecting its design before you fully patent it, I suggest you delete the two occasions on the reel where the shadow on the ground gives a skilled counterintelligence photo interpreter a fairly clear representation of a man holding a pole with one hand with something or other at the bottom of the pole which appears to be slowly moving.\" All of that is Stanley Kubriian for uh, Hey, there's a shadow in in one of your shots, right?\n Of of the Steadicam op.\n Yeah. Which is pretty cool of him to do.\n Sure.\n Because I'm sure there were plenty of people in Hollywood who would have been like, \"Okay, I think I kind of get the idea of what this was.\" Because there was no suggestion whatsoever of what what Garrett Brown had used to get these shots except in those shadows. So he went and went and immediately cut those, those I think 14 seconds out of his reel and then released the second edition and it, it looked pretty good. I mean, it's, it's rough compared to today's standard.\nSure. But I mean, from the time it was, it was like unbelievable, right? It changed everything.\n Oh yeah. Um, and one of the uh, shots that he got was uh, his wife Ellen. He said, \"Uh, dear, why don't you put on your most 70s bell bottoms you can find and uh, I'm going to run up behind you as you run up the steps to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and maybe when you get to the top you can raise your hands in triumph and I will spin around you.\" And if that shot sounds familiar, uh, it actually attracted a guy, a director named um, John, what is it? Aldson.\n Yeah, John G. Ason.\n Um, who said, \"I like this. I'm going to use it in this little film I'm directing called Rocky.\"\n Yeah.\n And I didn't get uh, whether or not this was the case. But did they um, did they locate Rocky in Philadelphia because of those steps?\n No.\nBecause he said, \"How did you do that?\" And um, where are those steps?\n I don't think so, man. Cuz I wondered that too. Like uh, like did he not have a scene written where Rocky just runs up those steps, right? I mean, Stallone wrote it, right?\n Um, I think they'll just have to ask him.\n Okay.\n Hey, Sly.\nI was wondering if you do. That was pretty good.\n I answered in that little moment. You'll Someone will have to interpret that.\nGreat movie though, man. I rewatched that uh, Rocky.\n Yeah. Like this year.\nYeah.\n From beginning to end. Just phenomenal movie.\n Yeah.\n I'm, I'm trying to get Emily to watch it.\n Has she never seen the original?\n No.\n It's its own thing for sure. Like it's not a boxing movie. No, really. It's a love story for the most part.\n It's a love story and like um, the triumph of the little guy.\nYeah.\n Story for sure. Yeah.\n Featuring boxing, right? That's exactly right.\nYeah.\n But two and three and up on onward, it's like a totally different thing.\n Yeah. But those were good, too.\nYeah. They said, \"Let's take your story, take out the heart, and insert cocaine instead.\"\n Insert insert Mr. T.\nI don't get the cocaine reference.\n Well, it's just the 80s and Hollywood got their hands on it. Sure. You know what I mean?\n I gotcha. Uh, yeah, that's a good question, though. I wonder about that if he Surely they didn't remake it for Philadelphia just for that. Well, but the the point is is Garrett Brown created on this sizzle reel the one of the most iconic shots in film making history for sure. And he sent that reel out and within that year, I believe 1976, three major motion pictures hired him to operate his Steadicam for it. Um, there was Rocky.\n Yep.\n There was um, what was\n\n\nThe one about Woody Guthrie? Bound for Glory. Yeah, I think that one came out first. So that was the first actual like uh and that one uh the steady came up was Garrett Brown, I think, for all these because he was the only guy that knew how. He got a lot of work early on. Yeah. And I think the operator, I think the patent was still pending until 1977. So I'm sure he didn't let that thing out of his... everybody close your eyes while I shoot this. Uh but on Bound for Glory, he was on a crane even that lowered down, stepped off the crane. So, um, people had seen crane shots, but then for the crane to go down, down, down, and then all of a sudden start following this guy, everyone was like, \"What in the world?\" Right. There would have been a cut. Yeah. After the crane stopped and then before, you know, they they would have cut and he would have gotten in position and then started up again. This is one smooth shot. One smooth shot. Yeah. And then the other one was Marathon Man. So, another great movie. Right out of the blue, this guy who is a commercial director and made short films for Sesame Street changed film making like single-handedly. Yeah, and won an Academy Award uh 1978 for technical achievement. Uh got that patent in '77. And um... well, that's it. That's the history of the steady cam. That's it, everybody. Good night. But we're going to... Should we take a break and tell everyone how this thing works? Let's do it, man. [Music] All right, Chuck. So, the study cam, do you remember when we did our episode on breathalyzers? Oh, boy. That was a long time ago. And we found out that the breathalyzer is one of the most complicated machines. Yeah. On the planet. It... I... I kind of hated that one. Like there were... there were crystals involved somehow. Mhm. I hated that one, too. Dark crystals. There were um... this is a bit like that. Like if you really dive into steady cams like this article on how stuff works does. It's... it's... it's labyrinthine. Talk about the dark crystal. Yeah. We're talking labyrinth instead. Yeah. But we're going to simplify it because uh you don't need to break this thing apart and look at every component like this article does. I mean, it really gets involved. Uh what you should do is look at a picture of someone operating one. Yeah. And just because when you look at it, you go, it... it all makes a lot more sense, right? And there... there's really just three main parts to the whole thing. There's a vest, there's an arm that's attached to the vest, and then the other end of the arm is attached to what's called the sled. Yeah. Which is what the camera and um its components are mounted on. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And that arm, it um... I mean, just picture yourself wearing a uh like a baby Bejorn baby carrier except for instead of the baby at your sternum, there's a mechanical arm coming out like a spring arm lamp. Yeah. Like a accordion arm or a spring arm lamp. Right. And it's virtually the same thing. Well, yeah. And guess who made one of these? Who? By himself before they started making them for at home people. Who? Casey. No. Who? My brother, of course. Oh, did he really? Yeah. Yeah. My brother made one of these in like the early '90s. Did he really? Out of uh door hinges and rubber bands and springs. Does he still have it? Is it in the Smithsonian? I don't know. It's in the Scottsonian. Nice. Which is where all his early inventions... with all his pinball machines? Yeah, but he made one. He basically did the same thing. He... he looked at it and looked at these uh swing arm lamps and accordion arm lamps and it's like, well, it's the same thing. I'll just make a version of that. It is. And it worked pretty good. It's virtually the same thing. Yeah. So the whole point of a steady cam is that it basically simulates or the arm at least simulates a human arm, right? To where it can move around very easily. Yeah. Um and it redistributes the weight of the camera, which can be up to like 70 lbs. I imagine probably more. Yeah. The whole unit is pretty heavy and it's not easy to operate. It'll wear you out. It holds it effortlessly and it holds it in place. This arm does. And it does it by using springs. And you can adjust the tension of the springs by using a cable and pulley system. Yes. So that it offsets the balance of the camera and holds it in space in front of the camera operator. Bas... basically so that they can move it effortlessly up, down, to the side. Um you can put the camera on top of the sled so that you get high shots. You can switch it so it goes on the bottom so you can get low angle shots. Yeah. The traditional... it's called high mode and low mode. And high mode is uh... it doesn't mean it's high. It just means it's uh on the top of the unit. And then low mode is when it's on the bottom. So if you wanted to film uh a mouse running across the floor, you would put it in low mode, right? If you want to film a human, you'd put it in high mode. Yeah. And the the camera itself is broken out into pieces, which is kind of an ingenious trick that uh I guess Garrett Brown came up with himself. I think he did. Um and this is the... this is the third part, the camera sled, right? Yes. The sled is what holds all the equipment, right? And it's basically a pole with a little bit at the top called the stage. Yeah. And that's where the camera goes. Or it could be at the bottom. Wherever the camera is, the camera is mounted to the stage. Yes. Then you got the pole itself. And then the... I guess the arm is connected to the pole by a um a gimbal. A gimbal. A gimbal. That's right. And that's like an old technology. It's basically something that uses basically a gyroscopic action to um take the movement of whatever is seeking to move whatever you want to hold still and getting rid of it. Yeah. Like everything around it moves except for the thing that you want to hold still. Yeah. It's pretty neat. It's super neat. And that's just the the one arm that's connected to the pole. Yes. So you can see how complicated this thing is that this guy sat back and I think in a hotel room somewhere he put it together. Uh Garrett Brown, the first one, the just the ingenuity it took to to put this together, it's pretty... pretty indepth as far as inventions go. Yeah. And there's a little science to it. Uh there's there's something called moment of inertia. It's basically how much that camera is resistant to rotation. So, if you want the camera to be still, you want to increase that resistance to the rotation. And uh this is determined by a couple of different things. Uh how much mass there is to the object and how far that mass is from the uh from its own axis of rotation. So by spreading the camera out, he basically took the little, you know, cameras come with a monitor now so you can see what's going on, right? And a big heavy battery. Yeah. He took the monitor off of the camera, he took the battery off of the camera and redistributed that up and down the pole. Uhhuh. So what he ended up doing was spreading out that mass uh which takes away the center of gravity from the camera itself. Yeah, because like with a regular camera where all the components are in one single unit, that center of gravity is inside the camera. Yeah. So, it's easy to rotate. But since he exploded it out into its various components, he made that center of gravity land somewhere on the pole, right? And the gimbal attaches to the pole just above the center of gravity so that the camera operator holds the pole and manipulates the camera at the center of gravity, which makes it very easy to to um balance, keep balance. Yeah. And they they do a good job in this article. If you like just take a broomstick and you find that center of gravity with your finger, you can hold it with a with your finger and lift it up and down. Right. And it... it just... it's balanced on your finger because you're hitting that center of balance. That's right. It's the same principle. Yeah. Um, and in fact, if you took uh if you took that same broomstick and cut it off and you just had three feet of broomstick and just took your SLR camera and screwed that broomstick into the bottom of your camera instead of a tripod, right? That would function. You could walk around with that and it would be steadier than if you just had it in your hand. Oh, I could see that because of the the change of the center of gravity. Change of the center of gravity. And if you put a little counterwe at the bottom, it would make it even more steady. And that's the whole concept of the steady cam sled. Then attach that to an arm... that that uh accordion arm, right? And you're cooking with gas. Yeah. Because you were saying like if you walk around with just the pole holding or the broomstick, cut off broomstick and you're holding it um just with your hand. Yeah. It's steady. The point of the arm is it's taking your hand out of the equation and replacing it with something that can isolate movement even more. Yeah. So that your movement of you walking just gets lost within the arm before it ever gets to the camera and could shake it. Yeah. Like if you did it with a broomstick, your arm is the same thing as a steady cam arm, right? Except it's better. The steady cam arm is... is better than your human arm, right? Yes. Exactly. Pretty neat stuff. It is neat stuff. Um, and I think that's it for the science, man. We made it through it. Yeah. I mean, it's all got to be very precisely balanced. Um, you don't just throw the stuff on the pole willy-nilly. No. And they point out that the balance of the camera can actually change during filming. Yeah. Just from the film moving from one end of the camera to the other as as it records, right? Well, yeah. In the old days when they use film, for sure. Nowadays, it's just that digital card. Yeah. I'm sure Quinn Tarantino's camera operators have to deal with this. Yeah. And if you've ever been on a job with a steady cam, there are a lot of uh there's a lot of breaks where I mean you can adjust them on the fly more now, but I remember there just being a lot of breaks where the steady cam op would say, \"Hold on, you know, I need five minutes.\" And they go over and they have a little stand that they put it on to take... cuz you know, it takes the weight off to a certain degree, but it's still a lot of weight to be carrying on a vest on your chest. Yeah. Um and running and moving and doing all sorts of stuff. Yeah. It's... it's... it's a tough gig. Like there's a pretty amazing video. Did you watch it of that Euro Vision shot? No. There's a guy from... I think Barus singing and they showed... they showed him like... I did see that... he... he's like... they... they showed the shot and then they showed what somebody filming the shot being done and the guy with the steady cam wearing the vest rides down the aisle on a a um Segway. Is that what he's on? Yeah. Hops off, runs up this ramp, and then starts circling around the guy who's singing. And it's a pretty amazing thing. It's a great shot, but then when you see how it's done, you're like, \"Wow, that guy deserved a a standing ovation.\" It would have been more impressive had it not like the subject matter been more uh interesting and the video quality been better. Pretty... pretty bad. Like if it was a Scorsese movie, you'd be like, \"Wow.\" Sure. But it was this, you know, kind of corny uh... Well, I mean, it looked like a American Idol or something. It was, but it was American Idol. If you took American Idol at its peak and then spread it out over Eurasia and and like it was popular over that that large of a population, that's what Eurovvision is. That's right. So, uh, you want to talk about some of the shots when we come back after a break, please. Okay. All right. So, Chuck, um, in addition to that Rocky shot and that Eurovvision shot, there are some other very famous shots, classic shots of all time. Uh, yeah, that had to do with steady cam. That couldn't have been done with without steady cam. Well, The Shining is the first one that pops into most people's minds because uh... like we said, Kubric was a big fan of this invention and uh immediately started talks with Garrett Brown on how to uh help him out with this movie, The Shining, that he was making, right? And um apparently they kind of battled one another quite a bit on uh the set of The Shining and and Garrett Brown later admitted he said a lot of that was probably uh what do you call it like inventors pride or something, right? Kind of getting in the way. Yeah. of this like brilliant alur. So, um Kubrick already had his own ideas on how to best use this thing that this other guy invented, right? Um and you know, The Shining's classic example, those tricycle shots. Yeah. Uh the famous maze chase at the end. Yep. Uh very iconic in motion picture history. Yeah. And um I mean the... the... How did they... you know how they did that that shot behind Danny on his little big wheel? They probably just went into low mode and uh... like walked behind him or... Yeah. ran down the hall after him. That's really impressive. Yeah. So, The Shining's a big one. Sure. Rocky's a big one. Good Fellas is another classic example, too. Classic. Um where Ray Leotaa and Lorraine Broco are going into the Copa Cabana, but they go through the back. Yeah. and they're followed...\n\n\nLike, throughout, like, the back stairs into the kitchen, and then they finally come out into their table, and, um, it's like one uninterrupted, like, five-minute shot or something. It's amazing, and it's, um, I think when you see this, you're, you might see it and not be a discerning film viewer and just say, \"Well, that, I didn't notice anything,\" right? Which is probably good. Yeah. Um, or you might be a fan of the Steadicams and just say, \"Man, that was amazing.\" Uh, then you have to step back and look at lighting and realize that how incredibly hard it is to light a shot like that that takes place over, I don't know, how many hundreds of feet. Uh, what without seeing the lights in the shot?\n\nWell, that, or just consistent lighting and having it look good. I mean, that's just, usually you light for like a room or something or a hallway. Yeah. But to light all those different rooms and hallways and, uh, just incredibly, I can't imagine how long it took to set that shot up. You know, they were like, \"Wait, what do you want to do?\" Yeah. Yeah. \"It'll be great. Don't worry about it. Stick with me. Stay with me.\"\n\nUh, you know, he's making another gangster movie.\n\nNo, I didn't know that.\n\nYeah. And it may be like, the Some folks are saying it's like, you know, his last big gangster movie.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it's got De Niro again.\n\nOkay.\n\nUh, he hadn't worked with him in a long time. Um, Pacino.\n\nNice.\n\nAnd Joe Pesci is coming out of retirement.\n\nI didn't even know he was retired. I just thought he wasn't doing stuff anymore.\n\nNo, man. He retired.\n\nI didn't know that.\n\nYeah. So, he's, he's got the three heavyweights and supposedly Harvey Cartel. Of course, you got to throw him in there.\n\nSure.\n\nBut I'm just like, giddy thinking about this.\n\nYeah. I, I'm glad he is, 'cause his last one was *The Departed*, right?\n\nNo, he's made movies since then. Like *Wolf of Wall Street*, gangster movie.\n\nYeah. Which I thought was great. I know you didn't love it.\n\nI just didn't.\n\nI thought it was awesome.\n\nI thought everything but what Jack Nicholson did was, was pretty good.\n\nYeah. You didn't like his performance?\n\nNo, I really didn't.\n\nWell, sorry, Jack. He'll forgive that. All right. Because you like him as an actor, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay. Uh, as good as it gets. Come on.\n\nUh, *Return of the Jedi*, uh, 1983, the, the famous, um, speeder, uh, bike chase scene.\n\nMhm.\n\nIn, uh, I think, indoor.\n\nYeah.\n\nCalifornia's Redwood National Park doubled as indoor. And that was Garrett Brown, uh, walking, and they sped it up.\n\nYeah. But, and you're just like, \"Wow, who cares?\" The, the, the reason why it's such an iconic Steadicam shot is because he walked very slowly.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd when you speed film up, the, um, tiny movements involved are telegraphed. They just become much more exaggerated. Yeah. So without a Steadicam, when they sped the film up again, it would have been just so blurry and just jarring. It would have been unusable. Yeah. The fact that you can see the trees and stuff, and even at that high speed, it's all Steadicam.\n\nYeah. And people, I think it's just so easy to take it for granted now in movies when you see these shots, but, uh, to pioneer these, these things and this equipment was, was remarkable.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh, and nowadays you can, there are all manner of at-home Steadicam. You don't have to do like my brother and build one out of spare parts and door hinges. No, you can buy one, uh, for not too much.\n\nYeah, you can, you can spend $100.\n\nYeah.\n\nOn a, on a decent enough little home Steadicam. They, uh, this article says that the, um, Steadicam Curve, which is made for GoPros, uh, it was like a hundred bucks.\n\nYeah. Well, those are teeny tiny. And, there's one for, um, the iPhone called, um, what's it called? The Smoothie. That one is like, it's like, I think even less than a hundred bucks, and it's just like a handheld camera stabilizer that works pretty well from what I can gather.\n\nYeah, we should have had Casey, our video producer Casey. He's in France right now, though.\n\nYeah.\n\nLiving the high life, right? Baguettes. We should have had Casey in here just giving thumbs up or thumbs down to each one of these brands that we mention.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I would trust that as like the gospel truth, right? Uh, but Casey's not here, so we're just going to say, read online reviews. I also saw that there's like a, a lot of, um, gimbal-based, uh, drone Steadicams.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat are just not, not that expensive.\n\nWell, dronesing, they're changing the game again.\n\nSure.\n\nBecause then you can do a shot where you follow someone by the swimming pool and then fly up into outer space with them if you want.\n\nYep.\n\nIn one continuous motion.\n\nYeah. Like the Quisp monster. The what?\n\nThe Quisp monster. You remember the alien from Quisp cereal?\n\nUh, do you remember Quisp?\n\nRemember the weird alien?\n\nSort of. I didn't eat Quisp.\n\nWasn't that a Captain Crunch knockoff, or was it different?\n\nIt was different because they were saucer-shaped rather than square waffle cut.\n\nGotcha.\n\nSame thing though. Yeah, same thing. It was good. It didn't cut the tongue like Captain Crunch did.\n\nOh, yeah. The roof of the mouth.\n\nI'll suffer through that still. Uh, and then, of course, uh, Steadicam is a name brand, right? We should mention Seeing Eye Dog.\n\nYeah, it's made, uh, who makes it?\n\nTiffen.\n\nTiffen. Now, that's what, yeah, I think, I think Tiffen does. They have a pretty good site. Like, if you are at all interested in this, like, they've got a great site, and they have all of their Steadicam models with a real, like, in-depth overview of them. And, yeah, pretty, uh, I think it's got all their manuals and everything just right there for you to read.\n\nYeah, there's other companies making them. Uh, there's one called Glidecam and Verizoom.\n\nYeah, but, you know, Steadicam's still probably the giant. It's like dollies. There's only two dolly makers.\n\nWell, well, there may be more now, but it's like Chapman and Fisher. And each, you know, every dolly grip has the dolly makers.\n\nYeah, Chapman dollies or Fisher dollies. It's kind of like, they're kind of holding Jameson or Bush Mills. Yeah. You know, Budweiser or Kors?\n\nNeither. Uh, and then, um, Garrett Brown, as if the Steadicam wasn't enough as far as revolutionizing filming goes, he later on invented something called the Sky Cam.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhich, like, if you watch any kind of sporting event now, especially, it's especially useful for football and in football. Um, where, like, it's there's just cables.\n\nYeah.\n\nAbove the field, and there's cameras hanging down that are just, like, doing overhead shots following the action. Like, it's nothing.\n\nIt's pretty neat. Garrett Brown invented that, too. I got one more little thing for you. Uh, there are two positions. Uh, not high mode, low mode. Positions are like how you're operating the camera. But, uh, if you are pointing forward as the operator and your camera is pointing forward, you're just walking, it's called missionary.\n\nNo.\n\nAnd then if you are, uh, if the operator is forward and the camera is backward, they call that Don Juan. So, leave it to film set goons to think of sexual names for sex it up camera positions. Don Juan.\n\nYeah, I never heard of that one.\n\nI hadn't either. Well, if you want to know more about Steadicams, including a really, really fine grain involved look at the physics of how the Steadicam arm works, you should go type steadycam into the search bar howstuffworks.com. Since I said search bar, it's time for listener mail.\n\nUh, I'm going to call this, uh, encouragement from a Christian listener.\n\nOkay.\n\nHey, guys, I was listening to the Easter show and was compelled to write in. As a Christian, I've always appreciated how you make a solid effort to not rail on the church too hard. I found it humorous and simultaneously sad when you felt you had to tiptoe around the pagan traditions that have been, uh, integrated with the resurrection. Uh, I find it disheartening to think that other believers can't find anything better to do than wait to be offended by something than jump all over you for it. But based on your years of experience and careful treatment of the subject, it must be the case a lot of the time. Personally, I just want to say I can't think of anything you've ever said to offend me. I think you've done a stand-up job with sensitive subjects, uh, like satanic panic in particular. Uh, it's also nice just to hear you talk about things directly related to my beliefs without sneering, uh, like many others will. Uh, that's nice, Dane in Minnesota.\n\nYeah, for real, Dane. Uh, if you want to get in touch with us like Dane did and be a super cool person, you can tweet to us at SYSK podcast.
