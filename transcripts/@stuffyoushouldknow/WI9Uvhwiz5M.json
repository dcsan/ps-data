  "cleanText": "Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.\nHey, and welcome to the podcast.\nI'm Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here, too.\nAnd this is Stuff You Should Know with a happy, fun, upbeat edition of Stuff You Should Know.\nUh, another entry in the shameful American history.\nYeah.\nBucket.\nUh, do want to thank a listener for this idea.\nBy the way, this came from David Bryant.\nNo relation.\nAre you sure?\nYeah, I don't have any.\nThe only David in my family is my cousin and he is a Mills.\nOkay.\nDavid, uh but specifically David Bryant's mom, I believe, gave David this idea or asked David uh if those boys ever did a show on the Project 100,000.\nAnd we also should shout out a writer uh Hamilton Gregory who was a Vietnam vet and journalist and who wrote a book McNamera Spali Colon the use of low IQ troops in the Vietnam War which I guess sort of gives away what we're talking about.\nYeah.\nBecause the name of the project Project 100,000 certainly doesn't.\nYeah.\nI mean another name of it was McNamera's Morons uh from uh Defense Secretary Robert McNamera, but that name is awful.\nSo, I'd love to not use it again.\nYeah, it's ridiculously derogatory.\nEven when this was going on in the mid-60s to the very early '70s, it was still quite derogatory.\nIt hadn't been like a medical term since like the 19s.\nSo, it was just mean all around.\nAnd that's pretty appropriate because this whole idea, this project, which was a um wartime effort to essentially lower the standards for military recruitment so that people with low enough IQs that they were either borderline or mildly cognitively challenged would be acceptable into military service.\nAnd it depends on who you ask what the purpose was.\nWe'll go into both of them.\nYeah.\nYeah, but for the most part it seems like it probably was as as bad as it seems on its face that it wasn't an actual like good idea ever among anybody.\nYeah.\nUh I mean that's that's a great setup for a change for us.\nYou know, usually people are like, \"What is this even you're talking about?\"\nYeah.\nAnd how did you guys confuse me already?\nWe're only in minute two.\nYeah.\nSo, uh I guess we'll just dive right in.\nUh I mentioned Robert McNamera who was uh during the Vietnam War uh was the secretary of defense and this was an idea that wasn't something that he just thought of then uh we'll get into it but he had thought of this idea previously but it was also something the U.S. military had faced previously when it came wartime and they found out that like hey uh we had a real problem with not having enough soldiers.\nWe really overestimated how many um like you know fit uh literate men were qualified to serve because this is what what a time when it was I mean was it exclusively men?\nYeah.\nWorld War II for sure at least for combat roles.\nI think there were other roles for women but as far as combat's concerned yes definitely.\nYeah.\nAnd so they uh and that was also the first war which is one reason they had this shortage uh that the first war that they had these really kind of big leaps forward in technology with you know weaponry and communications to where they had specialists that you know the brightest of the bright that did that stuff right and everyone else is in combat.\nSo once they had the specialists assigned they were like hey we don't have enough like frontline dudes.\nNo.\nSo they had a choice.\nThey could either say, um, some of you specialists, we may have, um, assigned you to radar duty too hastily.\nWe need you to be on the front lines because we don't have enough combat soldiers.\nOr they could lower their standards to allow more people into um the army or infantry, so they would automatically be combat soldiers.\nYeah.\nAnd one guy said, \"But my name is Radar.\"\nRight.\nAnd he said, \"Well, just get over to the mass unit then.\"\nYeah.\nMan, that show was not funny to me.\nIs Is this the first time I'm hearing this?\nI don't know.\nMaybe.\nYou're not a MASH fan?\nNo.\nI thought you love MASH.\nNo.\nI remember like hanging out with my dad while he watched it and he would like laugh and clap and everything and I'd be like, \"This is not funny.\"\nAnd then I grew up and I'm still like, \"This is not funny.\"\nWow.\nThat's funny because the other day, uh, RIP Loretta Swit who just passed away, Hot Lulahan.\nM I was remarking on Paul Tommpkins Instagram page cuz he did a little tribute to her that it's like it's so funny for me to think back of being like a 12-year-old kid watching a movie about alcoholic surgeons in the Korean War on Thursdays, five times a day, every other day of the week, four times a day.\nI ate it up.\nI thought it was the best thing ever.\nWell, I liked the movie.\nInteresting.\nWhy do you dislike the movie but like the show?\nNo, I mean the movie is it's the great Robert Altman, so I certainly love it, but uh I just think it's interesting.\nYeah, I thought you were a MASH guy.\nI never knew.\nI mean, once they got rid of Trapper John, I was like, I'm done with even giving this a chance.\nBut this is what I like about our friendship is we're still learning about each other after all these years.\nYeah.\nAnd we can still get along despite our views on MASH.\nThis is going to take me a minute, but it'll be fine.\nSo, we left off basically before this little tangent that the army had a decision either lower their standards to allow more combat troops in or get some of those specialists off to the front lines and they're like, \"We'll just go ahead and lower our standards.\"\nYeah.\nAnd they did that.\nUh they lowered the intelligence standards and uh they were pretty surprised.\nThey were like, \"Wow, uh a lot of you guys um maybe are illiterate and can't read.\nUm maybe you can't understand basic orders even.\"\nUh, we knew obviously this is in the 1940s, we knew so much less about um mental challenges and different intelligences and learning disabilities and like you were either this or you were that back then.\nAnd so all of a sudden they said, \"Oh, well, we got a lot of that.\"\nAnd we thought it would be a little more like guys like this, right?\nSo I think they they managed to get 350,000 men at least.\nUh they kind of opened the floodgates during World War II.\nThis is just between '42 and '45.\nBut the caveat to this is that the military provided remedial education classes.\nLike you would sign up for three years.\nThey would teach you, they'd spend some of this time teaching you what you didn't learn in high school because maybe you dropped out or maybe your high school sucked.\nUm maybe you had to work in the fields half of the day so you didn't get a full education.\nThe army educated them to bring them up to the level that their former standards met, right?\nYeah.\nOr tried to at least.\nYeah.\nThey did their best.\nUh and then after World War II ended and Hitler uh was dead, dead.\nUm the army was like, well, the military in general said, \"We're going to re raise our standards back to the where they were before.\"\nYeah.\nExactly.\nAnd then they need needed to make the movie MASH and then later the TV show.\nSo they started the Korean War.\nWell, wait.\nThe Rosenberg started the Korean War, don't forget.\nThat's right.\nUh, no, the Korean War came along and um they had the same problem, of course.\nSo, they lowered the standards again, of course, and there was another scramble to kind of get ready.\nAnd so, they were like, you know, guys, before we go into our next war, which we should do pretty soon.\nUh, we need to like have a real plan in place for this.\nUm, and and you know, get the manpower we need the right way.\nUh, and so part of that w, you know, led into what led to Project 100,000.\nYeah, that wasn't all though.\nNo, that wasn't all.\nUm, there was this uh this I don't know how much faith to put in this.\nSo, let's just let's just present it as if it's real and we'll let the listeners decide.\nOkay.\nBut there is a senator um named Daniel Patrick Moyahan.\nHe was a longtime sitting senator for New York.\nUm prior to that in in the era that we're talking about, he was assistant secretary of labor under both Kennedy and LBJ, he was actually one of the architects of the war on poverty.\nAnd I don't know if it was his idea or he just really bought into this idea, but it was that there's a bunch of people who aren't fit for military service either because they're overweight or underweight or because they're not intelligent enough to pass the basic intelligence standards.\nI think he found like 30% of American men weren't fit for military service because of those standards.\nSo he said, \"Okay, rather than like go back to the beginning and try to fix the educational system, let's just get these people into the army and let the army kind of like polish them up so that once they're done with their hitch, they can become productive members of society.\nAnd even better, we're taking people out of like abject poverty, giving them a chance to have like a a a life for themselves and provide a stable um a stable home for their children who can then go on to become middle class and so on and so forth and the cycle of poverty will be broken.\nThat's what Daniel Patrick Moahan was saying.\nYeah.\nAnd he had a lot of people on his side.\nIt wasn't some hugely controversial thing to propose.\nUh it was at a time when it was like, you know, you got a you got a kid who's a problem, send him into the army and you know, they'll they'll shape you up into a real man and a productive member of society.\nIt was kind of the way of thinking at the time.\nSo much so that uh John F. Kennedy and uh Lyndon Mains Johnson, they were big-time believers in this.\nThey they were both like fully fully on board.\nSo we just want to make that clear.\nIt wasn't just one or two people um making these decisions and there were presidents going, \"I don't know about that.\nThat doesn't sound like the best idea.\"\nRight.\nUm, we will kind of hit some early critics cuz there were some, but people were kind of steaming ahead, you know, full steam ahead with this.\nSteaming ahead, full steam ahead.\nMhm.\nThat's really steamy.\nThat's full steam.\nUh, yeah.\nKennedy said in 1963, our uh, today's military rejects include tomorrows or hardcore unemployed.\nYou know, it's funny.\nI have or written down on my thing.\nDo you really?\nOh, yeah.\nThat was the worst Kennedy anyone's ever done, but that was my best.\nI know we're all frightened and horny, right?\nUh, and the LBJ for his part.\nCan I do LBJ?\nYeah, please do.\nHe was a country guy, right?\nUh, Texan.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWe'll teach him to get up at daylight and work till dark and shave and bathe.\nAnd when when we turn him out, we'll have him prepared at least to drive a truck or a bakery wagon or stand at a gate.\nMhm.\nThat was more um a gentleman dressed in a Sears sucker suit at the Kentucky Derby, I think.\nAll right.\nEither way, the LBJ did that.\nHey, it was better than Mike Kennedy.\nHow about that?\nUh it was fine.\nUh so you mentioned that we were going to kind of run into some of the critics early um to this idea.\nAnd the the first vocal critics were the military leaders themselves.\nThey were like, \"This is no, we don't want to do this.\nWe we're not the army's not to rehabilitate and educate people who got left behind in school.\nUm do something else with them.\nUh there were other people who are like, \"Yeah, there's this thing called JobCore.\nHave you heard of JobCore?\nThat's what that's for.\nDon't send them to the military.\"\nSo it wasn't like a a home run once it left the Oval Office and started to spread outward on Capitol Hill.\nYeah, for sure.\nUh but that's where it did go because in 1966 is when Robert McNamera formally announced Project 100,000.\nUh but this was like I mentioned uh not only the U.S. military tried to do this before but McNamera himself had tried this before.\nUh two years earlier in '64 he proposed something called the special training enlistment program or the STEP program.\nUh and this was not full Project 100,000.\nIt was a little more like, hey, we got a uh like 40,000 guys that didn't meet the standards, but they're super close.\nUh maybe they're just below the the IQ test level, or maybe they need to put on a few pounds or shave a few pounds.\nAnd this STEP program was intended to kind of correct those guys up quickly uh into getting getting on board, but it would cost a little bit of money.\nThey would enlist for 3 years, receive this special training, and that special training was going to cost about 16 million bucks.\nSo, Congress said, \"Uh, no, we're we're not going to pay for that.\"\nNo.\nAnd one other thing, you kind of mentioned it, is that they were going to get remedial instruction like the the soldiers in World War II got, right?\nThat was part of the program.\nThat was what the 16 million was for.\nOkay.\nSo, Congress said no, like you said, and McNamera is like, \"Okay, whatever.\nI'm just going to move on.\nI have other things to do right now.\"\nUm like agitate for escalation in Vietnam.\nAnd in uh 1966, apparently he was chatting with some Marines and they made mention that they had actually set up their own little special training program so that the recruits who weren't cutting it or hacking it could be kind of like brought up to minimum standards themselves.\nAnd he had a a Eureka light bulb moment basically saying like I'm going to steal that idea and make it militarywide and that way Congress doesn't have to have their greedy little fingers in it because I can\n\n\nJust use their regular training budget for this kind of thing.\nYeah.\nAnd they can uh you know those Marines had their private piles that they got up to speed and turned them into killing machines just like in the movie.\nYeah.\nI mean, Private Pile is based on this Project 100,000 we're about to talk about, like 100%.\nYeah.\nAnd I feel like Forest Gump has got to be\nYeah.\ninspired by this even though that was never a part of the movie that at least made it into the movie.\nI don't know about original script if he had any kind of special training or anything.\nI don't know.\nOr the book by Winston Groove.\nIt's possible that he ran across that in the research.\nBut not just Forest, but Bubba as well.\nOh, yeah.\nGood point.\nYeah.\nSo, I say we take a break and come back and and um talk about how Project 100,000 actually kind of made it.\nLet's do it.\n[Music]\nAll\n[Music]\nright.\nSo, where we left off is Magnamera found a workaround from the official step program to basically an unofficial step program.\nAnd in 1966 they found that they really needed this because they had a a pretty dire manpower situation because well one reason is because of the incredible amount of deferments.\nUm I saw some stats that from draft eligible men in 1966 um 60% of them took some sort of action to gain a deferment.\nA lot of them rushed off to get married because initially there was a marriage deferment.\nUm, a lot of them went to college that maybe weren't too keen on it because there was a college deferment.\nThere were medical deferments.\nThere were certainly uh wealthy kids who had their parents uh pay their way out of the war with things like medical deferments.\nUh there were conscientious objector deferments, like 170,000 of those.\nUh people having kids, like they they sort of started moving the goalpost a little bit with the marriage and kids thing.\nUm because at first it was like if you're married, you're not going.\nBut then they're like, &quot;Actually, we need to marry you guys maybe if you just don't have kids.&quot;\nSo guys started having kids.\nSo long way of saying they needed they needed infantrymen on the front line.\nUh another way to avoid it was obviously joining something like the National Guard or the Coast Guard.\nYeah.\nBecause then you could be like, I'm that the Coast Guard is almost certainly not going to Vietnam.\nI'll join the Coast Guard so I can serve and help out, but I'm not going to be shipped off to Vietnam.\nSome people also just fled the country, went to Canada.\nSweden was another place where what are called draft dodgers ran off too.\nUm yeah, so yeah, there were a lot of people particularly middle class and higher who were just basically not having to go fight in Vietnam, right?\nYeah.\nAnd the other reason why they needed people or the basic reason why they needed a bunch of people all of a sudden or fighting men I should say on the front lines is because in 1966 the U.S. sent combat troops to the ground um in Vietnam in South Vietnam.\nTo that point um the U.S. had been nothing but advisers and trainers and then there was the Gulf of Tonkan incident where a navy ship was fired upon that kind of brought you the U.S. into the war and we started like doing firebombing raids and then finally they were like we need infantry men and that's when they really needed um a bunch of people to go fight in Vietnam and that's when Project 100,000 was like yeah let's let's do this because we need to\nYeah and I mean I didn't even look it up but I imagine were They trying to get 100,000 soldiers.\nWas that that number per year?\nOh, per year.\nOkay.\nCuz they ended up getting far more than that.\nThey did.\nUh they were officially active with this project from October 1st 66 through the end of the year 71.\nSo about 5 years.\nUh and there were early critics of this, you know, official program uh as well.\nUh and a lot of them um you know, kind of make sense, but a lot of them early on were civil rights leaders.\nUh there was a congressman named Adam Clayton Powell who said this is genocide for poor black Americans.\nUh it's nothing more than killing off human beings that are not members of the elite.\nBut nevertheless, they pushed on.\nYeah.\nUm I mean the very fact that these these men came from high levels of poverty and uh had learning disabilities in a lot of cases meant that they were not going to get any kind of college deferment.\nThey were almost certainly not in college.\nAnd even if they were, they weren't doing a good enough job to get a deferment.\nAnd then secondly, national guards almost to a state were still segregated.\nSo if you were black, you couldn't go join the National Guard and and not be shipped off to Vietnam.\nSo these were a really vulnerable population of people that they tapped into with Project 100,000.\nYeah.\nAnd they they called these guys New Standards recruits, uh, capital N, capital S.\nAnd uh most of those New Standards guys were sent to Vietnam.\nUm out of those guys, about half of them served in combat roles.\nAnd this is what that looked like.\nYeah.\nAnd I think there were a total of 354,000 men who were admitted in that time.\n91% hadn't met the previous minimum IQ requirements.\nAnd the median score on the armed forces qualification test, which measured intelligence, among other things, um was uh 13.6.\nwhich meant that the new standards men had an IQ average around 75 whereas for all recruits the average was IQ of about 100 and that's the average IQ I saw that 70 is the cutoff the beginning of mild cognitive disabilities so if 75 is the average that means there are people with real cognitive disabilities who were in this 354,000 men who were part of project 100,000\nyeah 48% of those guys were from the south uh compared to 28% of the total recruits and 38% were non-white uh when uh minorities at the time made up just about 10% overall.\nRight?\nSo you can imagine that um these these men who didn't meet the minimum requirements that had previously been met um some of them couldn't even meet these new lowered requirements.\nAnd so recruiters stepped in and did some really shady stuff to get people into this Project 100,000 shoot.\nYeah.\nRecruiters, I mean, they can say whatever they want because they're not, you know, you can't go back and said, &quot;Oh, well, my recruiter said I wasn't supposed to go to the front line.&quot;\nUh, that just doesn't fly.\nSo, they could say whatever they want.\nThey could say, &quot;You're not going to go to the front line.\nMaybe you won't even go to Vietnam.\nUh you may be, you know, you're going to get really great job training uh and set you up great for later in life after you get out of the army.\nTheir job is to rec recruit you not to be held to anything that they say.\nThat's so wrong, man.\nEspecially when you're dealing with people with cognitive disabilities, you know, for sure.\nEspecially people who are illiterate and some of them were illiterate.\nSo the recruiters would bring in ringers, people they paid to take the tests for the qualification tests for these these men who were the new standardsmen.\nUm and they that I mean that's just fraud, you know.\nYeah, for sure.\nUh they were, you know, once they uh got to basic training, they were uh bullied.\nThey were obviously um the object of from their um you know, drill sergeants and stuff like that.\nBut they were also bullied, you know, physically and, you know, emotionally within their, you know, platoon.\nAnd they didn't have any understanding a lot of times of even what was going on when this was happening.\nYeah.\nThat writer, Hamilton Gregory, recounted the story of one recruit who um couldn't tell you what state he was from, didn't know his left from his right, wasn't aware that the U.S. was at war.\nUm, I mean like really profoundly cognitively challenged men in in some cases who had no business being in the military.\nNot just because they were potentially in danger or most certainly in danger in a lot of cases, but they also posed a danger to other people in their platoon as well because they didn't know what they were doing.\nYeah, for sure.\nUh they did have those special training companies set up like you know Magnamera had envisioned uh you know from the tip from those Marines but a lot of times you know that didn't work and even when they failed to get through basic training they would just recycle them back through until they pass or just say you passed.\nYeah.\nThose recruiters also they use something called uh administrative acceptance.\nThat's what it was where they were given the power to say I think you're flunking this test on purpose so you're actually going to be admitted anyway.\nThey could use that to um to assign or to get these cognitively challenged men into the army.\nBasically saying like, I think you're smarter than than your test reflects, right?\nSo, um there was just no way that they weren't going to make it into the army and then through basic training.\nAnd I mean, once they once they got through basic training, I think you said half or more of them were shipped off to Vietnam and I think the majority of them ended up on the front lines.\nAnd the statistics about what happened to these men in Vietnam are are just shocking, especially when you compare them to the statistics for just the the military or the army as a whole.\nYeah.\nUh 5,478 of them were killed in Vietnam, which was a fatality rate three times higher than your average soldier.\nUh 1300 of those were killed by mines and booby traps.\nUh because a lot of times they were like just put one of those guys up front and if they step on the landmine then it's no big loss for us.\nYeah.\nUh 20,000 of them were injured including 500 amputees which is again at a at a higher rate than other GIS.\nYeah.\nI think I saw like 50 something,000 people were killed me Americans were killed in Vietnam.\nSo like the new standards men made up like 10% of that which I mean that's just crazy.\nThere are also like a lot of horror stories about these poor guys um and just the the what happened to them over there.\nUh there was one who um Hamilton Gregory wrote about.\nHe he would change the names of these uh men and he uh changed one of their names to Jerry.\nAnd Jerry was on night guard duty at his uh post in um Vietnam.\nAnd uh he was told that if he saw anybody coming up to the fort that he was to say halt and tell them to to say who they were to identify themselves, right?\nAnd even this basic order, Jerry couldn't follow it because when he saw somebody moving in the jungle, he just started opening fire.\nAnd it it turned out it was a an officer from his camp.\nUh and he killed him.\nHe he accidentally killed this officer because he just started shooting because he didn't know how to follow orders.\nYou know why guys like you and I aren't fit for the military?\nWhy?\nCuz you had a hard time coming up with the word order.\nYeah.\nWhat what's it called?\nWhat that Sar yelling us about?\nThat thing he wants us to do.\nYeah, the the instruction, but like angry instruction.\nAngry instruction.\nI think that's a definition of order is an angry instruction.\nI think so, too.\nUh they also um and this is, you know, it gets even sadder.\nUh new standardsmen were referred for psychiatric evaluation 10 times as frequently as other troops.\nMhm.\nAnd you know they were obviously going through a lot of anxiety, a lot of depression, extreme agitation, and some of them frequently attempted suicide uh or you know went awall or attacked their fellow uh soldiers which all of a sudden you're in the stockade.\nUm you're getting a a conviction and a dishonorable discharge which we're going to talk more about in a minute.\nYeah, that was a big a big issue.\nBut I mean, I saw the A-wall thing described as like I mean, imagine if everybody's really mean to you, beats you up, and you just don't understand why.\nOf course, you're gonna want to get away from it if you just can't make sense of that heads or tails, right?\nSo, AWOL, I mean, there was a pretty good reason for a lot of these guys to go AWOL.\nUm, and again, I think Private Pile's experience in basic training was like pretty true to life for what happened to some of these guys.\nAnd you know, Private Pile chose um Kill and then die himself rather than Awall.\nBut a lot of them chose AWOL instead.\nWhat a movie.\nYeah, man.\nThat movie is just amazing.\nWe're talking about Full Metal Jacket, by the way, just in case people are like, &quot;What movie?&quot;\nYeah.\nSo, good good call, man.\nUh The Great Stanley Kubri.\nUm should we take our second break?\nUh I think we should.\nYes.\nAll right.\nWe'll be right back and finish up with Project 100,000.\n[Music]\n[Music]\nSo, uh, I said there are a lot of horror stories and there are a plenty um for the McNamera boys or project 100,000 men.\nUm what's much harder to find are positive stories, like hopeful stories.\nUm I could find two, but it turned out they were actually the same guy.\nYeah, this isn't a silver lining situation.\nNo, definitely not.\nBut the guy um his name was Mike Sanchez, uh not his real name.\nAnd he had two different experiences while he was in Vietnam.\nAnd both of them were because he was essentially adopted by his commanding officers at both of his posts.\nYeah.\nWhich I mean that's still not a silver lining, but at least there were some compassionate officers who took these guys under their wing and were like, I'm going to try and see that this kid doesn't go home in a in a pine box.\nUh so thankful for that obviously.\nBut uh one of the things that happened was um a soldier like this and and you know apparently it happened to others is they were they were given assignments um sort of under the wing of that officer like maybe be their driver.\nUh and in this case this guy was assigned to drive an officer but couldn't drive and and didn't have the capacity to learn how to drive.\nSo that instead of just you know sticking it back on the front line this officer drove himself and just had this guy sit next to him in the passenger seat.\nYeah.\nSo, I mean, like that's really taking a soldier under your wing.\nLike, that is just straight up protecting him.\nThat was after um that was the second part of Mike Sanchez's stint in Vietnam.\nThe first part of it, he actually distinguished himself in battle.\nAnd this is actually pretty similar to\n\n\nForest Gump, if you think about it.\nWell, I think this might have been directly inspired by that.\nThat was my feeling.\nOkay.\nSo, uh, Mike Sanchez, uh, when he first got to Vietnam, uh, his first commanding officer also took him under his wing to protect him and was like, \"You have no business being here.\nI'm going to see to it that you make it out of here alive.\"\nAnd Mike Sanchez was the kind of guy who just, if you were nice to him, if you were kind to him, if you treated him with respect, he would be loyal to you to the end.\nLike you just captured his heart.\nAnd that happened with this first commanding officer.\nHe felt deeply loyal to them, and they ended up in a firefight together.\nRight.\nYeah.\nAnd kind of just like out of the movie Forest Gump, uh, the officer, um, ended up in big trouble.\nUh, Mike couldn't find him.\nEveryone said he's back there.\nHe got hit, but no one was going back to get him.\nSo, uh, that's what this guy did.\nHe ran back, uh, ran back, you know, forgoing his own safety.\nUh, called out for him, found him wounded.\nHe couldn't move and carried him to safety through some serious, you know, bullet fire and was, uh, got the Silver Star for that action.\nYeah.\nAin't that cool?\nIt's pretty great.\nYeah.\nMike Sanchez is just one of those rare hopeful or nice stories.\nUh, he actually went on to become a barber, which was his dream.\nUh, because his brother was a barber, so he got to go work with them after the army.\nYeah.\nAnd again, don't bother googling because his name is not Mike Sanchez.\nNo.\nBut you can find an account of this by the second CEO who he was the driver for.\nHis name was Jim Bracewell.\nHe wrote an account about Mike Sanchez.\nIt's worth reading for sure.\nUh, there was another one.\nThis is from, uh, Dave Ruse.\nUh, one of these guys, his name was Elmer.\nI don't know if that's his real name or not in this case, but he was, uh, apparently just a real, uh, had a real talent for keeping things super clean and orderly, and he was assigned his assignment was to clean a sick bay on a big Navy, uh, ship.\nAnd he, he may not have understood like what sterile meant and things like that, but he really knew how to get stuff done and keep the place clean and sterile.\nAnd he apparently was had a pretty rare positive experience and that everyone loved this guy and everyone thought he did a great job.\nAnd that's sort of like that's sort of what I was thinking earlier is, you know, they knew so little about different intelligences and things back then, and they probably could have found a lot of roles that might have been suitable for some of these guys.\nInstead, they were just like, \"We want warm bodies on the front line because they're basically expendable.\"\nYeah.\nI mean, like basically booby trap catchers essentially.\nYeah.\nSo, yeah, those stories are very rare for the most part.\nUm, the Project 100,000 recruits suffered greatly and not just, um, in battle, but also at the hands of their own, um, platoon members.\nUm, like they just had it horrible all around in a lot of cases.\nAnd so it's not much of a surprise that when they were studied after they left Vietnam and came back to the U.S., um, they had a much harder time than even the average Vietnam vet who had a hard time, uh, themselves.\nThese guys had it even harder.\nThey were apparently significantly more likely to suffer PTSD compared to other vets, and that they had a harder time holding on a job.\nThey had a harder time with everyday living, and that they were more likely to experience homelessness, drug addiction, and suicide than even the average Vietnam vet.\nYeah.\nWhich, you know, the the big thumb in the eye in all this is it was kind of posed as, \"No, these guys are going to be so much better off after serving their country in the army.\"\nYeah.\nThey're going to get better jobs.\nThey're going to, you know, work themselves up into a maybe lower middle class situation when they came from poverty in a lot of cases.\nAnd they've studied this, uh, when compared to even when compared to other low IQ Americans of the same age.\nYeah, this is big.\nUh, the veterans had worse financial outcomes.\nUh, there was a study in the '80s that found that 10% of low IQ veterans were unemployed compared with only 3% of low IQ non-veterans and earned less money.\nAn average of $18,000 a year compared to $24,000 a year for non-veterans.\nYes.\nAnd so again, just to just to clarify, they were supposed to have a better life like you said after the war than and they had a worse life.\nAnd one reason, a huge reason why, is something you, um, touched on earlier.\nA lot of them, I think something like half of them were discharged under conditions other than honorable.\nAnd if you have anything but an honorable discharge from the military, you are stigmatized for the rest of your life.\nUm, not only will businesses typically not hire you, there's plenty of businesses who won't, the military itself, like the VA, um, will help you less than it will help other vets.\nLike, it's harder to get access to health care and to job counseling and to all the things that somebody like a Project 100,000 recruit would need after they got back to America.\nThat was shut down to half of them because they were discharged dishonorably.\nYeah.\nI mean, it's just so shameful.\nUh, there was at least one guy, there was a recruiter who I guess felt pretty bad about taking part in this.\nUh, his was a veteran named Bill Daniel, and he, you know, put a lot of thought into this after the war and said, \"You know what?\nI'm going to,\" uh, they called it \"bad paper\" if you got a, uh, dishonorable discharge, and so he wanted to appeal as many of these bad paper discharges as he could, and he was successful in, uh, 400 cases.\nUh, you know, 180,000 of them were dishonorably discharged, so 400 isn't much, but, you know, this for Bill Daniel to, you know, to spend his time and his life, um, getting 400 of these guys cleared is pretty admirable.\nYeah.\nUh, and then one more thing about the bad paper, the dishonorable discharges.\nApparently among Project 100,000 recruits, the main reason that they that was given for their dishonorable discharge was that they were unsuitable for the military.\nAnd that was the case from the outset.\nThe military brought them on on purpose anyway and then spit them out the other end saying, \"You should have never been in the military in the first place, and now here's the stigma for you to carry around for the rest of your life.\"\nYeah, man.\nSo, did Robert McNamera feel bad about all this?\nBecause he's certainly somebody who, uh, maybe more so than most, uh, secretaries of defense, um, looked back a lot on his life, and he wrote about it, and he and there was a memoir called In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam.\nHe also very famously was in the great Errol Morris's documentary, The Fog of War, where he talked at length about things that he did right and wrong, so surely he looked back on Project 100 as a big mistake, right?\nNo, no, I could tell by your tone that you knew do that.\nBut he didn't.\nHe actually did apologize for things like, um, his involvement in in pushing for escalating the war in Vietnam.\nLike he, he wasn't one of those guys.\nHe's like, \"Nope, I never did anything wrong.\nYou're all wrong.\"\nHe soularched, like you said, more than most other people, uh, in his position, but he never apologized for Project 100,000.\nAnd I don't know what that says on like on its face, you would suspect, well, he really was a true believer.\nHe didn't think it was a like he he wasn't doing anything nefarious.\nBut I mean, these guys who were like planning and carrying out the Vietnam War, you had to be nefarious to be doing that, you know.\nSo how much credit can you give them?\nHow much how much benefit of the doubt do you give him?\nYeah.\nI don't know.\nI mean, the the, uh, vet that wrote that book, Hamilton Gregory, uh, he himself was like, \"Yeah, you know what?\nI, I think he actually had good intentions.\nI think he really did think he could coach them up into a better life and that the military would be genuinely good for them and that it was just a tragic misjudgment, um, and not just a attempt to, you know, supply the front lines with warm bodies.\"\nBut, you know, that's that may be generous.\nI don't know.\nYeah.\nOther people like the guy who wrote, um, We Were Soldiers, Joe Galloway.\nHe was embedded with the Seventh Cavalry in battle with in Vietnam.\nUh, he actually was one of the rare civilians decorated with the Bronze Star for Valor during a battle he was just a war correspondent in.\nUm, he was like, \"No, this is unforgivable.\"\nHe essentially said in a column the day after McNamera died, like just from Project 100,000, he's on his way to hell basically.\nYep.\nI mean, that's what he said.\nNot I'm not saying he's on his way to hell, right?\nYeah.\nAnd I'm paraphrasing, too, but that's that's basically what he said.\nYeah.\nAnd I think a lot of people agree with him for that, too.\nUm, you got anything else?\nI got nothing else.\nUh, looking forward to moving on to more positive stories.\nYeah.\nWho was the person that, uh, suggested it?\nUh, David Bryant's mom.\nThanks, David Bryant's mom.\nWe appreciate that.\nThat was a good idea.\nI'm glad, uh, we learned about it.\nI'm glad we could tell everybody else about it because it's not a very well-known part of American history.\nTotally.\nChuck said totally.\nHe just triggered listener mail.\nUh, this is about our shorty.\nUh, can you not have a name?\nUh, hi guys.\nMy second time emailing.\nUh, I just listened to \"Can You Not Have a Name?\" and had to email about a most unusual name I've come across in my 50-plus years of working with the public.\nUh, 30 in the restaurant industry, 16 doing vacation rentals, and now four and a half years owning a flower shop.\nNice.\nUh, about seven or eight years ago, a customer, uh, came in of Asian descent and gave me his credit card that showed me his surname as Y.\nI commented.\nI said, \"What an unusual last name.\"\nAnd he asked if he was if it was a common Asian name.\nAnd he said, \"Actually, my last name is only Y.\"\nUh, but American Express does not accept a last name composed of just one letter, so I had to add the second Y.\nWell, just to get the credit card.\nUh, also, my sister and I are both baby boomers, and we were not given middle names, so we could take our maiden name as our middle name once we got married and not have to drop that middle name.\nOh, I never thought about that.\nOh, worked for my sister, but I'm still single and looking for a man with a short last name.\nUh, what's her name?\nUh, so this is Jane Trinowski, who is the owner of Leavons Florals in Newport Beach, California.\nAnd I even went to the website.\nLooks like a lovely flower shop business.\nAnd so, uh, you know, pop in and see Jane if you you're a boomer with a short last name.\nYeah.\nYou could do a lot worse than going to Newport Beach for a day or two.\nTotally.\nUh, well, thanks a lot, Jane.\nWe appreciate that.\nWe love anecdotes and stories about stuff that have to do with episodes we've recently recorded.\nAnd if you have one of those, you can talk to us via email.\nSend it off to Stuffpodcast@iheartradio.com.\n[Music]\nStuff You Should Know is a production
