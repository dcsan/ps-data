  "cleanText": "Hey everybody, continuing the Stuff You Should Know Summer Movie Playlist. This episode from February 2015 focuses on some movies that changed filmmaking. From the very beginning of the film industry up to Star Wars and beyond, all these movies pushed the whole thing forward that much more and got us to where we are today. And as a bonus, Mystery Science Theater 3000 makes a nice little cameo in here. Enjoy.\n\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.\n\nHey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant aka Cisco and Eert. Save us the aisle seat. And Jerry's over there. I guess she's Jean Shallot. That's the stuff you should know. Try on for it. I don't know why that tickled me so much. Cuz Jean Salot's a funny looking, I guess. Yeah, Jerry's not. I'm just picturing her with a big afro and a mustache and like a tweed jacket and bad opinions about movies. Jean Charlotte had a look for sure.\n\nStill he's around, right? Uh oh, yeah, I think so. Yeah. RIP. Both Cisco and Eert. So sad. I know. Um have you seen the Roger Eert documentary? No, I've heard nothing but good things. Really, really good. Very touching. Yeah. What is it? Uh something life life uh like mine. Life with me. Life on top. Life itself. Life itself. Life with thumbs. It was really great. And I watched it on made the mistake of watching on a plane and I was just like my allergies are acting up. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I was I was watering. Because of your allergies? No. Because I was sad. I was crying. Do you want me to say it? Oh yeah, crying on a plane. I was confused there for a second.\n\nThat's better than when I watch other movies that are on my laptop that are like uh have like bad violence or or nudity or something. I'm always just like, \"Oh.\" And I kind of lower the laptop and it's like, \"I didn't realize this was in here.\" And the lady next to me is just like, \"Gh, you disgust me.\" Yeah. Cuz I don't you I want to be sensitive to the people around me, you know? I'm not one of those jerks that's like just lives in my own bubble. It's like watching some sex scene on a plane. Oh, you're like elbowing the lady. Yeah. No, I hate it. I was I was so embarrassed. That happened to me a couple of times. I'm like, I needed to start going PG on movies. Yeah. He just looked like airplanes. Jud Appattow. Huh? Am I right? He's unpredictable. Yeah.\n\nAll right. So, Chuck, this is your episode to shine, man. Is it? Yes. You're a movie guy, too, though. I like movies, but I've I almost consciously don't let myself watch movies on a like a film afficionado level. Oh, right. You're just pure enjoyment. Yeah. I don't ever want to see the individual shots and just be like, \"Oh, well, that could have been better.\" Whatever. Um and and just miss the movie as a whole. Yeah, I fall somewhere in the middle of that. I try to let go, but um like our our video producer director Casey is is pretty bad about that. And our buddy Scotty who shot our TV show. Oh, he's the worst. Yeah, he's just the camera work and that lighting in that scene. Yeah, Scott's awesome. Hey, Scott. Hey, Casey. They're all in here with us in spirit. And hey, this is the last show in this studio. Yeah, last episode in the old office. Yep. The murder room. Couldn't feel more neutral about it. I actually feel less than neutral, less than zero. It's It's weird. That was a good movie. Thank you. Great shots. Yeah. I say thank you as if I directed it. Right. I not only directed it, I also played Andrew McCarthy.\n\nUh yeah, I'm ready to get the heck out of here, man. Can't wait to get in that new office and the Yeah, it's gonna be good. tiny little dedicated studio. Whole new world. All right, let's do this. Okay. So, Chuck, films, you've seen one or two of them in your time. Sure. Have you seen any of the ones in this list? I know you've seen a few of them, but have you seen like some of the early ones? I've seen Well, we'll just go piece by piece because I have not seen Battleship Potemkin. Okay. Um, but I do love Mandy Patinkin. It's a little different. Yes. In spelling, pronunciation, meaning the whole thing. Uhhuh. But it's close, I guess.\n\nBut we're talking of course about films that change filmmaking in some way or another. And the first one on the list is from 1925. Battleship Potemkin. That's hard for me to say. Which is not the first movie, by the way. The first screen movie was workers leaving the Lumiere factory, which is 47 seconds long and the most boring piece of celluloid anyone's ever put together. But it was the first. That's right. This was many years. That was a full 30 years before Battleship Potemkin. By the time 30 years had passed, like we were doing like narratives and there was banning and all sorts of great stuff. Yeah. And Battleship Pinkin fell under both of those umbrellas. It was a narrative story. It was a silent movie. That's right. But it told a pretty clear story and it was a bit of Russian propaganda as well. Yeah. It tells the story of uh a 1905 uprising in uh where there were Russian sailors uh basically uh there was a mutiny aboard a ship and then the bad guys the Cossacks came in looking for uh revenge. Yeah. 1905 that would have been rising up against tyranny would have been rising up against the um Romanoff monarchy I guess. Nice. But it was made in 1925. So this is a time when you know Lenin and Trotsky and all those dudes were running around trying to do the great experiment. Yeah. And uh it ends up turns out that the battleship Potemkin was banned in some countries. Some countries are like we don't want this rusky propaganda. Right. But Russia itself later on banned it when Stalin came to power because he was a self-aware dictator. Oh, was that the deal? Yeah. Okay. He knew this could be a metaphor for rising up against my dictatorship. So, I'm going to just ban this movie. Oh, yeah. Even though it's Russian propaganda.\n\nWell, filmatically, I need to bring the history, by the way. Uh, filmatically speaking, it was a landmark film uh because of the montage. uh most notably the Russian or Soviet theory of montage which is basically that um your impact is going to come from juxtaposition of shots and not necessarily a smooth sequence of shots, right? Um and it should be rhythmic instead of necessarily being tied to the story. It was like a a a rhythmic series of shots and um this one is popular. Um it was the Odessa step sequence as one of the five acts and it is huge because it has been aped and um mimicked and mocked and um homagged probably more than I don't know about more but a lot of times in film history. Well, yeah, the montage it's like a go-to editing technique, right? Oh, yeah. Well, the montage in general, but specifically the Odessa steps. Oh, okay. There are two notable parts in that sequence. Uh, one is the um, you know, it's basically a big charge on these these grand steps leading up to a building and a big battle in Odessa, Odessa, Texas. And, um, there's a part of it where there's the old the old baby carriage going down the steps. You know, what's going to happen to the baby? And it sounds tired because we've seen that in uh, you know, The Untouchables. Yeah. Notably the I did not find it tiresome. Uh, Naked Gun 33 and a Third. Yeah. Okay. Uh, Everything is Illuminated, the great movie by Leah Schreiber. Um, that was from directly from the Odessa step sequence in Battleship Potemkin. Nice. The baby carriage. Yeah. And the old um shot through shot in the eye through the glasses. Oh, cool. That comes from this movie, too. They were the first ones to do it. Yeah. Um, and you've seen that in Woody Allen's Love and Death and Bananas and of course The Godfather, the great sequence where Mo Green's getting the massage and he looks up and puts on his glasses during a montage. Yeah, that's exactly that whole sequence. Assassination montage. Yeah, because that was uh an assassination on the steps as well. Oh, yeah. So, that was definitely a double. Who was that? That was Francis Ford Coppola. Oh, yeah. He he was clearly aware of Battleship Potemkin. Clearly. I was trying to think of other examples of montages and the only thing I could come up with was the A-Team building something, but that counts as a montage, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's like a some related in some way related shots that are kind of put together that a little bit transcend like tell a story in itself. Yeah. Like Rocky training for a fight or something. That's another good one. A lot of times it's set to music. Yeah. I love that. That's the only one you could think of. And uh in the great movie Brazil 2 has the shot through the glasses bit as I like to call it. So that's Battleship at Damin. Doesn't one of the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark get shot through the glasses? Maybe that wouldn't surprise me. It's been it's been ofted, you know. Yeah. So Battleship Potemkin was a it made a pretty big splash in 1925.\n\nIn 1926, the following year, the next movie on the list, um I it wasn't his first, but it really solidified, I think, his stardom. Buster Keaton stardom. Yeah. The General. Rightfully so, too. Yeah. He was uh one of the great um well, some people call him the greatest stunt man to ever live. It he's done some stuff that I think earns him that. Yeah. Because this is back in the day, too, where he was legitimately risking his life, right? You know, like the the very famously where he's standing on the street in front of a house and then the whole front of the house falls over him and the window just goes right around him. Yeah, I watched that again today. Yeah, it is. I can't believe he did that. You And there's actually a half of a second where his arm jerks up because he's startled as the house finally makes its way like into his peripheral vision. Yeah. And it has to be one of the most dangerous things a human being's ever done on film. Oh yeah. I'm sure the whole time before that was like, \"We did the math, right? You did the math. Do the math again. Do the math again. Show me the math. Show me the math.\" Yeah. Because that's all it was. It was math and measurements, right? But uh yeah, he could have been squashed and killed very easily. And he had a lot of faith in everybody who was pulling off the stunt with him. You know, he had to just stand there. That was his whole thing was he had to just stand there. And his bit was that he um was he played it straight constantly. He was a stonefaced actor. Yeah. Deadpan. Yeah. He kind of started that whole thing because his big um I was about to say rival but I guess um just contemporary Charlie Chaplin while similar in some ways was completely different because Chaplin was constantly mugging for the camera and like asking for the audience uh sympathy, right? Or raising his eyebrows or Yeah. Like look what's happening to me. Come on. Come on. Whereas Buster Keaton would just he had that dead pan look the whole time. Yeah. He would go from like a house falling around him to jumping on a train or something like that with just the same blank facial expression. Yeah. And the reason this is a highly influential film, The General, is because it kind of showcases the best of both. um the the amazing stunts that would be mimicked and uh throughout the years and built upon and then the dead pan style that influenced everyone from obviously Bill Murray is one of the great deadpan actors of all time. Yeah. Like you can count the number of times Bill Murray even smiles in a movie on like two hands. Sure. Much less like apes or laughs or anything. Michael Cera's mentioned in here and I'm like he I think he might have Bill Murray beat as far as dead pan actor goes. Yeah. Well, Zach Galifianakis is on the list. He's super dead pan. Yeah. Um Leslie Nielsen of course. Amy Poehler I think is a is a a woman that's a very dead pan. Yeah. Has a dead pan style. Jason Schwartzman. Yes. But people say this is this all is a direct descendant of Buster Keaton's work. Yeah. And if you think we're overstating this, go watch any Buster Keaton movie. You will be thrilled and delighted. And if your attention span has been shredded to ribbons by the internet, just go on to YouTube and type in Buster Keaton and it'll bring up all sorts of um clips of his awesome stunts. You will be thrilled and amazed. I promise. Yeah. And I think I made a note here, by the way, that we have a Fatty Arbuckle retraction to make. Uh remember when we we called him out as the rapist murderer? I didn't say murderer. Well, we said rapist at least, right? But uh we were taken a task by a fan. He was he had he was acquitted of all that stuff. And apparently didn't do uh either act. And um his career and life and family name were ruined forever. So he was um evidently done a grave misjustice. And we sort of cavalierely just uh still call him that today. Yeah. I need to look into it more\n\n\nUh, all right.\nHey, so next up we have The Jazz Singer, the 1927 edition.\nNot the Neil Diamond one.\nNo.\nAnd there was one in between, too, uh, with Danny Thomas, I believe.\nUm, I like Neil Diamonds.\nIt's good.\nI never saw it.\nDid you ever see it?\nNo.\nNo, it's not bad.\nUm, but this is the original from Allan Crossland, and it is notable because it was the first feature-length uh, movie that was at least 25% spoken dialogue, right?\nDoes that make sense?\nYeah, it's totally new.\nYeah.\nIt wasn't.\nIt wasn't the first talkie because they had short films that were talks, right?\nAnd there was a movie the next year, I'm sorry, yeah, in 1928 called Lights of New York that had 100% full spoken dialogue, but The Jazz Singer had a mix of music and spoken dialogue, right?\nThe first big, big daddy feature-length film to do so, right?\nWith substantial dialogue, right?\nYeah.\nAnd they did it in the most roundabout, difficult way that you could possibly do it, which is to record the audio and the soundtrack, both the dialogue and the music onto vinyl records.\nYeah.\nProbably wax records, really.\nAnd then, um, the projectionist had to sync the record up with the film strip so everything was in sync.\nYeah.\nThat was a device called a Vitaphone that Warner Brothers uh, sunk about half a million into uh, this company called Western Electric who invented it, and it was actually physically connected to the projector's motor.\nAh.\nUm, so they did, while they did have to sync it, it was, it was a physical connection between the phonograph player and the projection uh, uh, reel, I guess.\nYeah.\nAnd it went on to gross three and a half million bucks for 1927.\nThat's man, a lot of dough.\nThat's a ton of dough.\nThat's like 56 million today, at least.\nYeah, at least.\nBut uh, was ineligible for the best picture because they were just like, you, you can't compete with the rest.\nIt's not fair.\nOh, wow.\nBecause everything else is silent and everyone's going to vote for you.\nYeah.\nSo that changed the whole game for sure.\nUh, we will continue on with our awesome and engrossing list right after this.\nStop.\n[Music]\n[Music]\nSo, Chuck, um, if you'll notice, the first three movies in our list, the first three films that changed everything happened in 1925, 26, and 27.\nThings were changing fast.\nThey really were.\nI mean, like, we by leaps and bounds, but you can also make the case that there was a lot of new ground to cover.\nSo, just about anybody who did anything new that was noteworthy in Yeah.\nIt was a big innovation.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nHarder to innovate these days.\nIt is.\nUm, and if you'll notice on the list, um, so the, the earliest ones were like technical editing innovations.\nUm, now starting with Citizen Kane from 1941, we start to get into innovations in storytelling, which is a lot more nuanced than, you know, um, doing your own stunts or, uh, using a montage or something.\nIt's, it's figuring out how to tell a story in a much less linear narrative fashion.\nYeah.\nAnd Citizen Kane was one of the early ones to pioneer a nonlinear narrative.\nYeah.\nDid you uh, you saw this?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nI didn't see it till, I mean, it was probably like uh, probably about 15 years ago, but like way later than you would think I would have seen this.\nYeah.\nAs a big film buff.\nI saw it in college at a um, in a film class.\nYeah.\nSure.\nYep.\nOften.\nYeah.\nIf you sign up for a film class, you're going to study Citizen Kane.\nExactly.\nPretty much.\nI finally found out where Rose Bud was.\nDon't ruin it.\nI won't.\nUh, but it is a landmark film in every way, and it has often been topped of best films of all time lists for great reasons.\nUm, one of which, like you said, the nonlinear narrative was a really unique thing at the time.\nUm, although Flashback wasn't uh, brand new, it was the first time it had been this extensive.\nYeah.\nAnd effective in the story.\nYeah.\nCuz I mean, it's substantial enough that it really cuts up the flow.\nOh, yeah.\nYou know, it's not like a quick flashback and they come back and the actor is like staring off into space to transition back into the present again.\nI mean, like, it was all over the place.\nYeah.\nYou know, uh, some of the more um, concrete cinematic uh, landmarks.\nUh, one was using deep focus.\nUh, director of photography Greg Toland, legend, used uh, he had used deep focus before on a movie called Long Voyage Home, but um, it's all over the place in Citizen Kane.\nAnd that basically means if you see a shot where something uh, very far away is in focus in the shot, basically where everything's in focus, where the background and the foreground are in focus.\nSo you can press pause and look around.\nExactly.\nLike you're sticking your head into a box.\nYeah.\nThat's called deep focus.\nYeah.\nAnd it was brand new uh, as far as Citizen Kane uh, goes is how extensive it used it.\nYeah.\nUh, one of the other things was um, off-center framing.\nUm, it was a big, you know, pretty common thing to just center whatever the main action was, either the character or the object, and um, Citizen Kane had a lot of things where the main focus of the scene, the character, maybe even offscreen, uh, which was really weird at the time.\nPeople didn't know what to think of it, right?\nUm, expressionistic lighting.\nUh, back then everything, they just lit it.\nThey're like, make sure everything's well lit.\nYeah.\nUm, but wasn't Otto Preminger also like a big pioneer with that?\nYeah, I think so.\nWith um, Dial M for Murder, or I think he directed that.\nWas that Hitchcock?\nI think that was Hitchcock.\nWas it?\nOkay.\nWell, Otto Preminger directed stuff like that, though, right?\nHe was very.\nHe used moody lighting and shadows and stuff a lot.\nI probably messed that up.\nPeople are going to be dial in for murder.\nI think it was Preager.\nOkay.\nUm, but uh, Orson Welles, of course, I don't think we even mentioned that's who wrote, directed, starred, and produced, and I think he even edited Citizen Kane.\nYeah.\nI just assumed everybody knew that, you know.\nYeah.\nUm, he came from the theater where uh, you create a mood with lighting uh, only certain parts of the stage.\nSo, he brought that into the movies and uh, it was very um, evocative and set the mood well, and people are like, \"Man, why are we lighting everything all bright all the time?\nLook at Citizen Kane.\nThis really worked.\"\nYeah.\nUm, couple of other things.\nOne of which I know you will appreciate, sir, is that he pretty much invented the wipe.\nOh, the star wipe.\nNot the star wipe, but it followed.\nYeah, the star wipe followed.\nOkay.\nWhich I know is your favorite transition in cinema.\nOh, it's almost star because it almost makes a sound, you know.\nUh, and by the way, I want to say you're right.\nDial M for Murder was Hitchcock.\nOh, was it?\nYeah.\nOkay.\nWhat was Preminger?\nDid you look that up?\nHe did one called Laura, The Man with the Golden Arm.\nIt's not who I'm thinking of.\nI'm thinking of a director named Otto who directed in like the 20s or 30s, and he directed like moody um, like, like moody movies, like, yeah, murder movies.\nYeah, like film noir.\nYes, film noir.\nThat's exactly what I was going for.\nAnd I don't remember who it was.\nMaybe his name was Otto Film Noir.\nHe's French.\nUm, and then one final thing, of course, that you could study Citizen Kane for a week in a film class, so this is an overview, but um, the low angle shots, um, people didn't use a lot of low or high angle shots back then.\nIt was kind of just shot from straight on.\nAnd, um, Morrison Welles even dug out, cut out the floor a lot of times to get the camera lower.\nWow.\nAnd for the first time, we saw ceilings in view uh, in a movie because quite often things were shot on a sound stage where you don't have ceilings.\nAnd um, he wanted those low angle shots, so they used um, fabric most times to act as a ceiling, but very effective shots of from below of uh, Orson Welles as uh, I mean, it wasn't exactly William Randolph Hearst, but it was an approximation of William Randolph Hearst, right?\nIt's a very effective low angle stuff that now, I mean, we take for granted all these things, um, but you know, there would be no Pulp Fiction in that uh, nonlinear storytelling if there was know.\nWell, maybe somebody would have done it, but maybe eventually, but you know, he did the first, and and that's why it was innovative.\nExactly.\nIt's Fritz Lang that I was.\nYeah, there you go.\nYeah.\nFritz Lang, Metropolis and M.\nJust M.\nThat's okay.\nYeah, it's all making sense now.\nI get confused.\nYeah, but you were right on.\nYou were right there.\nFritz and Otto are not close.\nI mean, they're both German, but that's about it.\nYeah, but do you know the difference between M and Dial M?\nJust a telephone.\nWhat's up next, Chuck?\nBreathless.\nOne of my faves.\nSo, I am going to uh, rely on you mostly for this one because I looked up what the French New Wave really did, what it accounted for.\nYeah.\nAnd like all of the essays I found were hard to, they were dense.\nYeah.\nAnd I didn't really understand.\nI understood that the French New Wave like changed everything.\nYeah.\nAnd that a lot of the movies that I know and love today are the um, offspring of the French New Wave, but I still didn't get exactly specifically what the French New Wave did.\nAnd you were going to rely on me to summarize this?\nYeah.\nNo pressure.\nNo.\nWell, for me, the French New Wave basically ushered in an era of uh, what now I think most people might associate with indie filmmaking.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nLike uh, handheld camera work and what some people at the time considered amateurish camera work.\nUm, movies where maybe not a lot seemingly happens.\nYou know, nothing grand happens, which was the case in Breathless.\nA lot of people didn't like it at the time because it was like, you know, not much happens.\nYou know, that the two leads in the movie, uh, Jean Paul Belando and Jean Seabourg weren't really, like, didn't show, express a whole lot of deep love, and there weren't these big moments of love and affection and these huge action sequences, and it was described as flat by a lot of people.\nUm, and I think a lot of indie movies do that, just kind of show life as it happens.\nYeah.\nSo without Breathless, we wouldn't have like Bottle Rocket.\nMaybe Wes Anderson is definitely a big French New Wave guy.\nYeah, for sure.\nUm, but uh, Godard, Jean-Luc Godard who directed it, and Truffaut and some other um, French New Wave forefathers were film critics at first.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah.\nAnd they decided as a group, like, we want to look at cinema in a new wave, um, and do something different.\nSo they went and started making their own movies.\nThat's like uh, James Fenimore Cooper.\nOh, yeah.\nThe guy who wrote Last of the Mohicans.\nOh, really?\nYeah.\nHe apparently used to complain that like nobody wrote good books anymore.\nAnd so I think his wife or something said, \"Well, why don't you do a big shot?\"\nAnd he did.\nAnd the books he wrote weren't so great, but he, he, he went and wrote them.\nAnd he wrote a bunch of them, too.\nOne of my favorite far sides ever is the um, second to the last of the Mohicans.\nIt's just a line of uh, of Native Americans and the second to the last one.\nThey're online facing away.\nHe's just sort of turning around and waving at the camera.\nThat is a good one.\nOr I guess the camera at Gary Larson's hand.\nUm, so Breathless is notable for those reasons.\nIt kind of kicked off the French New Wave, but the use of jump cut editing, which we see so much now.\nIt was the first movie, and it was very jarring at the time to see jump cuts in a movie.\nYeah, I'll bet.\nUh, and that's when you're showing like uh, I guess the best way to describe it is um, multiple shots of the same subject or thing from different angles, right?\nIt's like um, you indicate the progression of time or movement or something by just cutting quickly rather than focusing on somebody walking down the street for five minutes.\nYeah.\nYou cut a couple of times, and all of a sudden they're just closer to the camera and then closer and closer, and then they're past the camera.\nIt's a jump cut.\nYeah.\nOr even as simple something as simple as like you're going to leave the house, so you go and pick up your keys and you put on your coat.\nInstead of showing all that, you come out of the bedroom, boom, you're putting on your coat.\nBoom.\nYou're putting the keys in the door.\nRight.\nExactly.\nYou're just showing the high highlights of this progression of stuff where that would otherwise be boring to watch the whole thing, but it also um, is used to create tension, too.\nYeah.\nIt because it's, it's um, jarring, I guess, is probably why it creates tension.\nAnd Scorsese famously used it in Goodfellas.\nOh, yes.\nAt the end when Henry Hill is like, like trying to sell some guns to Nero.\nYeah.\nHe's coked to the gills, right?\nAnd he's like trying to sell some guns to Nero, but they don't fit the silencers.\nAnd like he's the helicopter's following him.\nHe's got the sauce going, and all this stuff is being represented and compressed into a very short amount of time by the use of jump cuts.\nYeah.\nVery effective.\nAnd for budding filmmakers, it's a great way to hide mistakes um, of things you may not have gotten that you thought you got.\nUm, jump cutting is a really easy way to, to just sort of uh, yeah, to hide your errors.\nYeah, I, I did it a lot.\nIn other words, when I was making those shorts, I um, I was, I realized in my head,\n\n\nI was referencing the um shot in Soul Taker. You have you ever seen that Mystery Science 3000 with It's um his last name is Estz. It's Martin Sheen's brother. Uhhuh. And uh he is a soul taker and he's next to this guy who's a soul taker. You just have to see this. But anyway, they're they're walking down the road and this jump cut like has this progression of them, right? It It's so unnecessary, but it's like a great use of jump cut. You could tell the director was like, \"I can't wait to use a jump cut.\" And that's what she did. She used it on. Um, but go watch that MST3K. It's a good one. Man, you've Did you see every single one of those episodes? No, it's still I still run across ones that I haven't seen. Yeah. Nice. Um, hey, and a shout out to Bill Corbett, who I know is a listener. Oh, yeah, he is, isn't he? Yeah. I don't know if he's gonna hear this one, but um, the great Bill Corbett. Soul Taker. Uh, next we are going to move on to Federrico Fellinis, eight and a half. You ever seen this one? No, I haven't. It's good. Now I understand why it's called that though. Yeah, it was one of the first, although not the first, movies about filmmaking. And uh starring the great Marcelo Mastriania from Lulchvita. Mhm. Uh a muse of Fellinis over the years too. And this one um this one really kicked off the surrealist filmmaking and sort of saying you can play around and shoot a dream sequence where the the guy's in traffic and then he leaves his car and floats up in the air and is, you know, being pulled down to the ground on the beach from a rope tied around his ankle. Just like go nuts. Yeah. And successive filmmakers did go nuts like um Gandry did uh Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Oh yeah. He's hugely influenced. Um Darren Areronowski Mhm. did some weird stuff here or there. Yeah. Um David Lynch and Terry Gilliam of course. Yeah. Just basically surrealism is is what I'm taking Fellini introduced into this. Yeah. For real. And um besides the surrealism uh that opening sequence of 8 and a half where the director of um he's the director in the movie uh Guido is stuck in traffic. It's really claustrophobic feeling and that's why he floats away uh and escapes you know that that traffic jam. But that was directly mimicked in like RM's Everybody Hurts video. Oh yeah. And um the beginning of the movie Falling Down. Do you remember that? That started with the traffic jam that Michael Douglas just left. He doesn't float. He gets like an uzi. I saw that again the other day. Most of it. Does it hold up? It's weird. It alternately felt way ahead of its time and also very dated. Yeah, because the stuff that Michael Douglas was doing felt way ahead of its time. But then there was I just forgot about that whole um weird subplots with Robert Duval retiring and he had this wife that was henpecking him and like this retirement party they were trying to throw him. I forgot about that too. Yeah. It was just so unnecessary and felt really weird and out of place the other day. Yeah. When I was watching it. Was there like a jump cut montage where he's putting on his watch, his gold retirement watch? No. But then too, the Barbara Hershey, you know, is in Venice at home with the daughter and he spends a whole day coming there to grab them basically. And the whole time she just keeps calling the cops like, \"I know he's coming. I know he's coming.\" And I was watching the other day I was like, \"Freaking leave.\" Oh yeah. What are you doing there? Yeah. That's a movie character thing. You know, that's just bad writing, bad directing. When you just walk right past the ability to leave, there's you you missed a huge step. Where were we? Falling down. Yeah, I think that pretty much sums up eight and a half. I think so, too. Falling down. Boom. So, Chuck, uh, we got a little more left. We got more films. Is this making you want to watch films? Yeah, me too. I feel like eating ice cream, watching a film, and scratching from Poison Ivy lately. Yeah. And burning this office down. Uh, you know, if that happens now, suspicion's going to fall on you for saying that. That's all right. Uh, we'll be right back after this. Stop. No. [Music] All right. So, we're back with our awesome jingles, which by the way, um we we have to thank uh John Bean. Begin. John begin the begin. He even emailed with the pronunciation of his name, but he um the original guy who did our jingle, the first jingle ever, Rusty Mattius or Matias. Man, I'm not good with the pronunciation. Uh well, anyway, Rusty, who's band, The Sheep Dogs, are on tour right now. Yeah. Um just because his work was so original, we contacted him and said, \"Hey, we got this other guy who's done like covers of your work. Can we use these?\" He's like, \"Totally mash it up, brother.\" And John's been making awesome like versions of it ever since. Yeah, they're both great and talented. Thanks to you both. And go check out uh I think what you say they're on tour, right? Yeah, the Sheep Dogs. Yeah, go check out The Sheep Dogs. Yep. In a town near you. Yeah. All right, let's uh finish with these two in reverse order. Okay. Toy Story was a big one. Hugely innovative. Huge. Oh, yeah. And again, it's one of those things where now almost everything about it seems pedestrian. Sure. Or what it did. Yeah. See, it's still a great movie, I'm sure. Oh, yeah. Um but the the innovations that it it undertook or just seemed pedestrian, but at the time it was totally groundbreaking. Yeah. Game changer. It was the first um the first CGI movie, all CGI movie ever. Yeah. That was enormous. Well, yeah. And I remember at the time seeing it and just being like, \"Wow, this is the future of animated films.\" What's the best all CGI animated film you've ever seen visually? Uh, well, I haven't seen a lot of them these days because Emily doesn't like those, so I probably wouldn't be the best person to ask. Holly from uh Stuff Mom or Stuff You Miss in History Class. She'd probably be the one to ask. For my money, have you seen The Adventures of Tintin? Oh, yeah. That was amazing. Mind blowing. Yeah, I saw that on your recommendation. Really, really liked it. Yeah, the story was great. The action was great, the characters were great, but the CGI, the computer animation is, I think, possibly the best ever done. Yeah. And that's a bit of a different style than say like Up or um The Incredibles. It's not nearly as cartoonish. It's like the what I think it's the motion capture. Yeah. I think that's what they did for that. Oh, yeah. With Up it would strictly be totally just animation, right? Yeah. But I mean, they're both animation, right? Um but yeah, man. Tinten, that was really good. It was good. I was surprised how much I like that. But Up was good, too, and Toy Story was good, too. And but all of these things came as a result of the the ground that Toy Story broke. Absolutely. In 1995, um like you said, what seems like a common uh thing today. I mean, you don't see cell animation anymore. It's almost I know. I kind of miss it. I totally miss it. Like the new um Mickey Mouse is all weird and CG. Like stuff from our generation should have just been discontinued. Yeah. And then you just come up with all new stuff that's CGI. Strawberry Shortcake not supposed to be CGI. It just all looks weird now. Yeah. I wish there would have people would have done a little bit of both still because I think Cell animation like uh I think the Iron Giant came out after Toy Story and they did Cell Animation. Yeah. And that was great. Yeah. Great movie. I haven't seen that. Oh, it's really good. You'd like it. uh like it was a movie for grown-ups and Toy Story sort of laid the way for that because uh it was one of the first movies um I guess cartoony kids movies to really have a lot of dialogue that flew over kids heads that adults got a little nod and a wink. What? Toy Story. Yeah. Yeah. Not like Dirty Horror, but it's not like Fritz the Cat. No, no, no. But a little entandre here and there that adults might appreciate that kids won't understand. Right. Those are the best jokes, right? Um, and now we have, you know, best animated uh feature in the Oscars, which definitely came straight out of uh the original Toy Story because movie started being considered before they created its own category. Uh, Up and Toy Story 3 were actually nominated for regular best picture. Yeah. And I think everyone was like, \"Oo, we need to get them their own category because we can't have an animated movie win best picture, can we?\" Well, Up would have come after um the the best animated picture category came out. Oh, really? So, that kind of goes as a testament to just how amazing that movie is. Yeah, that's right. That was that it was still up for best picture. Oh, it was both. I don't know if it was up for It probably was up for best animated as well, but it was definitely also up for best picture. Oh, wow. While there was an animated category. Yeah, I I never considered that. Bam. That was a good movie. Yeah, it was sweet. Um, so I got nothing else in Toy Story. Well, then what about the last one? Yeah. 2001 of Space Odyssey. Man, quite a film. You sent this uh essay on Criterion, I think criterion.com, but you know, the Criterion Collection. Yeah. Um, it was written, I guess, in 1988, even though it says posted in 1988. It's like there wasn't an internet to post it on in 1988. Maybe it means posted it like in the mail. Maybe. Um, but it I realized like I can read film essays about Stanley Kubri's work all day long. Yeah, me too. Like I love that documentary um room 227. Was it 227? 237. 246. 23 237 247. You know the one about the shining conspiracy theories? Yeah, the the number of the room is amazing. I can't remember though. Um I I read a bunch of articles is I think 237. Um, I read a bunch of articles around the release of that documentary, which were basically like film essays on C on The Shining. I read this one amazing one um from several years ago about Eyes Wide Shut about how it's like a a masterpiece of sociology studying sociology. A lot of people hate that movie. Yeah. Um, and then now this like 2001, I'm sure there's tons out there to consume, but I I can just read that stuff all day long because that guy was so just amazingly detailed as a director. Yeah, I agree. I can read more about his work, critical essays on his work than any other director. Right. It's just unbelievable. It's almost like it's its own genre. It is. You know, Kubrician. Yeah. It's got a word named after it. And well, it should. Um so 2001, A Space Odyssey, 1968. Um blew minds back then, blows minds today. uh one for its uh just the amazing look and the technical achievement. Um it ages really well. I mean if you see a movie from 1968 about outer space, it still looks like the future. Yeah. You don't expect it to hold up well. But it totally does. Um so much so that a lot of the you know George Lucas and Ridley Scott were just like it's done, right? Like we might as well give up. Yeah. George Lucas when Star Wars came out said Star Wars is technically comparable but for my money 2001 is by far the better movie. Yeah. Everyone was sort of intimidated I think by how talented Kubri was. Well plus also um you have to take into account that he made this movie at a time when other sci-fi movies were just pure schllock. Oh yeah. So, not only to to make the movie in this way, this visually amazing and amazing with an audio soundtrack and just totally innovative. It also took like that mindset to just completely go in a different direction that everybody else has as well. Yeah, of course. I think about Ridley Scott saying that and then he goes on to make Alien and Bladeunner after that. So, I mean, he he helped Prometheus, man. Yeah, I People don't like Prometheus. I don't care. It's a cool movie. No, I liked it, too. I thought Okay, one one flaw, the big flaw to me was and I'm sure it's like part of the subtext or the context or one of the texts, but um the the the engineer coming back to life or coming out of hibernation after however long and just immediately like inflicting violence on these pebbrained humans who are showing him no threat whatsoever. Yeah, I just thought it was a little uh it wasn't explained well enough, I think, for my taste. Yeah, I I think I agree with you. But when I'm watching a Ridley Scott movie, I just assume if I'm missing something, he has an explanation for it. I'm just not catching it. Yeah, I know what you mean. I'd like I think I read some stuff about how it tied into the alien cannon and realized I need to go see it again with all this knowledge that I wasn't really thinking about.\n\n\nYeah. And maybe I'd like it more.\nYeah.\nBut I haven't done that yet.\nSo, back to 2001.\nUm, oh, yeah.\nIt was also notable for being bookended basically with 30 minutes of silence on both ends of the movie.\nThe first 30 minutes are, and when I say silent, I mean no dialogue, right?\nAnd the last 30 minutes have no dialogue.\nYeah.\nThe last line comes like a full 30 minutes before the end.\nYeah.\nAnd over the 146 minutes, there are only 40 minutes of dialogue in the whole thing.\nAnd um, that's why I just when people compare something like Interstellar and call it Kubrician, I just want to smash.\nDid you not like Interstellar?\nNot really.\nOh, I liked it.\nI was super let down.\nDespite McConna doing Wooderson in the future, I still liked it.\nI even liked him in it.\nI liked a lot of the parts of it, but um, to me it's antique Kubrician because every 10 minutes they're explaining everything that's going on all over again.\nThat was another thing.\nJust like Inception, Ellen Paige's entire character was written in to explain what was going on every 10 minutes.\nYeah.\nAnd I felt like Interstellar was the same way.\nIt's like Christopher Nolan needs to just trust his audience a little bit like Kubrick did and say figure it out or don't.\nYeah.\nNo, that's that's true.\nI'm not going to stop every 10 minutes just to explain everything.\nHere's what's going on.\nRemember, or if you didn't get it right, here's what's going on again.\nWell, I think if they are labeling something like Interstellar is Kubrician, right?\nOne of the ways that you can interpret that is that he was he rooted his 2001 in science fact.\nYeah.\nRight.\nSo, like the stuff that the astronauts are like dealing with and the things that are going on and the conditions of space, it was all factual.\nWhereas with Interstellar, same thing.\nThey went to really great lengths to do what they could to make everything scientifically factual.\nAside from the fact that the idea that you could go into a black hole and then come back out or something like that, sure, drifting in space, that's not going to happen.\nBut for the most part, Interstellar was scientifically accurate.\nSo maybe that's what they meant when they called it Kubrician because you're absolutely right.\nLike they did explain a lot and went to great lengths to explain a lot.\nWhereas with 2001, you just watch it the first five times like what just happened.\nYeah.\nAnd apparently Carrie Grant had that same reaction as well.\nIt was Rock Hudson.\nRock Hudson.\nThat's right.\nYeah.\nThe original screening that Roger Eert was at in LA, Rock Hudson just left and said, \"Can somebody tell me what the hell that was about?\"\nYeah.\nAnd it wasn't even over yet.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUm, well, the reason it has science fact and not science fiction is because Kubri and Arthur C. Clark, who, oh, yeah.\nIt wasn't actually a book that was made into a movie.\nIt was a movie a book made after a movie.\nYeah.\nAnd they collaborated on both.\nAnd um, they went to Carl Sean, um, of course of Cosmos and said, he said you're gonna make billions and billions of dollars.\nThat was pretty good.\nWas it?\nYeah.\nSounded a lot like him.\nUm, they went to Carl Sean and said, \"Hey, we want to portray these extraterrestrials.\nUh, are they maybe the star child is uh, or they turn Dave into the star child.\nAre they humanoids?\nWhat are they going to look like?\"\nAnd Sean was like, \"They were very unlikely to be humanoid.\"\nSo Kubrick did the smart thing and was just like, \"Well, we just won't show him right at all.\"\nInstead of making a fool of myself like signs and making some dumb looking alien.\nOh man.\nMan, let me just not show the aliens.\nVery smart move.\nYeah.\nUm, getting back to the story of uh 2001, although I think The Village is underrated.\nYeah, I can stomach that one.\nWhat about uh, well, you like The Six Sense, right?\nEverybody liked The Six Sense.\nSure.\nUh, I guess that was it for him.\nI loved Unbreakable.\nUnbreakable.\nYeah, that was one where like, yeah, I think it was maybe even better the second time.\nYeah, I still like that movie.\nUh, but then he also made that Lady in the Water movie and the the, the one with Marky Mark.\nUh, the people were jumping off Four Brothers.\nNo.\nThree Kings.\nUh, is it the one in the elevator?\nNo, he just produced that.\nOh, I know what you're talking about.\nThe one where people are like jumping off of buildings and stuff inexplicably.\nYeah, that I didn't even, I didn't see that either.\nI couldn't get through 10 minutes of that movie.\nSo, um, 2001, back to good movies, was, uh, had a three-act three-part structure, but not a conventional three-act structure that you might be used to in movies, which is why it confounded people like Rock Hudson.\nUh, the first, they called them movements.\nThe first movement was the, uh, the Dawn of Man sequence with the apes with the monolith.\nUm, and uh, he has that great part where he throws his little bone tool up in the air, right?\nAnd then it morphs into, well, not morphs, but it maybe it's a dissolve into the um, spinning in outer space.\nIt's called a match cut.\nYeah, match cut.\nAnd um, of the rotation of what we now know was a nuclear warhead.\nUh, because I read that little article, 20 things you didn't know about 2001.\nI didn't know those were nuclear warheads necessarily in outer space.\nThey made it a little more vague.\nInitially, it was going to be uh, more explicit and they were going to explode it in outer space, right?\nBut he said, \"No, this a little too close to uh, the ending of um, Strange Love.\"\nStrange Love.\nYeah.\nSo, let's not do that.\nYeah.\nProbably a good choice.\nYeah.\nBut some, as a result, some people have taken it to mean that like it was a, that match cut was supposed to show how far humans have come, right, from using a bone to murder somebody to satellites in space.\nBut if you know that the satellite is actually loaded down with nuclear warheads, that match cut demonstrates how little humans have changed.\nOh yeah.\nFrom using a bone to murder somebody to using satellites to murder somebody, the motif is still the same.\nAnd it's murder.\nYeah.\nHe was going for some deep things.\nOh yeah.\nA lot of metaphor happening.\nYeah.\nI mean, supposedly in every single shot because he started out as a still photographer, right?\nYeah.\nSupposedly every frame of a Kubrick movie, you there is nothing that isn't unintentional and placed there by him.\nHe did a lot of his own set decorating.\nYeah.\nLike the pencil holder on the desk in the office of the guy at the Shining Hotel, right, was where it's supposed to be.\nRight.\nAnd if like if it has like a the picture of a goat head inscribed on it, that means something, right?\nIt's not accidental.\nYeah.\nAlthough I will say room 237, which I think may have been the point, is a little bit like these people are crazy.\nNot like, oh man, I just see what they're saying in all this, right?\nI was just thinking these people are nuts, right?\nIt, it's, it was just kind of enjoyable to hear their interpretations of it.\nWell, and I think it had a, it was a comment on obsession and fandom more so than The Shining.\nFor sure.\nBut there, I thought there some of their ideas were interesting.\nTotally.\nI said room 227, didn't I?\nLike one of the conspiracy theorists is like Mary.\nWasn't room 227 like a sitcom?\nYeah, it was just called 227.\nOkay.\nYeah.\n227.\nGotcha.\nRemember with Jack K, she'd be like Mary.\nOh, okay.\nThat's what my impression was.\nWhat' you think I was doing?\nWell, I wasn't sure what you meant.\nJust being a weirdo.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nUh, the second movement was, of course, the uh, the how sequence, the computer, the how, uh, was it the how 9000?\nYeah.\nUm, really creepy.\nAnd Hal ended up being a lot of people's favorite character, even though it was just a voice, the supercomputer on the Discovery Ship.\nRemember, he's like, \"What are you doing, Dave?\"\nIt's so creepy.\nI, I had the Mad Magazine spoof of 2001 when I was a kid.\nIt was great.\nYeah.\nUh, and then the third movement is when Dave uh, moves on to uh, the next stage of human development with these extraterrestrials that you only hear.\nAnd um, basically it's when it comes full circle, the third movement.\nAnd the third movement is the one that has almost, well, it's really just the second movement that's most dialogue.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUh, some of the alternate titles for 2001.\nJourney Beyond the Stars.\nTerrible.\nUniverse.\nNot bad.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nUh, Tunnel to the Stars.\nNot so great.\nPlanet Fall.\nThat sounds bad.\nSounds like a James Bond movie.\nAnd then how the solar system was one as a play on how the West was one.\nYeah.\nWhich like movie geeks would find that appealing, but everybody else would say that's dumb.\nYou ruined everything.\nYeah.\nAnd Kubrick was, uh, this is the last thing I have.\nHe was so obsessive uh, with protecting his material that he allegedly, uh, I don't think allegedly.\nI think he did.\nYeah.\nHave all the sets and props and miniatures destroyed after he shot it so they would never be reused, which was a common thing at the time.\nYeah.\nLike, hey, we're doing a space movie.\nGo get that uh, go get that space ring from Stanley set.\nYeah.\nLet's reuse it for uh, Planet Fall.\nHe, uh, he also destroyed all of the footage that didn't make it into the original theatrical release.\nYeah.\nDestroyed.\nIt's gone.\nYeah.\nSo they wouldn't one day after his death recut it, which they invariably probably would have done.\nYep.\nHe's a smart man.\nYeah, I could, we, we should just do a podcast on Kubric.\nOkay.\nHe, he was, I, I'm down for that challenge.\nABA dude.\nYes.\nOne of my heroes.\nYeah.\nCinematically.\nYou got anything else?\nI got nothing else.\nUh, if you want to know more about movies, if you like this one, you'll probably also love our exploitation episode.\nExploitation movie episode.\nWhat else have we talked about movies in?\nCannonball Run.\nOh, yeah.\nThat, that had a lot to do with the movie.\nYeah.\nOur James Bond episode.\nYeah.\nUh, yeah, we've had a few of these and people always respond to these.\nThey're like, \"You guys should have a spin-off show.\"\nYeah.\nDo an all movie podcast.\nSure.\nMaybe one day.\nMaybe.\nRemember, if you're looking for any of these, um, press control F or Apple F in your web browser and search that way on our podcast archive page.\nUh, you can also search for this uh, article on how stuff works by typing movies in and seeing what comes up.\nAnd since I said how stuff works, it's time for listener mail.\nUh, I'm going to call this Mike Dupont.\nReally clear something up for us on scientific method.\nOkay.\nUh, hey guys, it was a great, um, well, actually, he doesn't say it was great.\nI think I just made that up.\nHey guys, your scientific method podcast has a consistent misuse of what a scientific law is in relation to uh, to the working of the scientific method.\nUh, it appears that you believe that a law, e.g., Newton's law of gravity, is in held uh, in higher esteem than theory and that eventually a theory matures into a law.\nUm, I think I probably did think that because of politics, right?\nYou know how a bill becomes a law, right?\nExactly.\nHe says when in fact theory is considerably more robust than a law.\nUh, a law is a mathematical model that describes observed behavior.\nDoes not answer the why.\nRight.\nTheory does uh, answer why something happens.\nDid we not say that?\nI thought we did.\nLike I, I knew that.\nI remember finding that out from the research.\nI just can't believe it didn't come out of my mouth.\nHe claims we did not.\nAnd I feel like I'm learning this so I definitely did not.\nOkay, go ahead.\nBut you may have.\nUh, for example, Newton's law of gravitational attraction describes the action of two bodies that can be used for pretty much everything.\nUm, it is perfect for describing what happens, but it cannot tell you why the two items are attracted or drill down to the underlying mechanism.\nYeah, law is like much more succinct.\nIt just is what it is.\nUh, nor is the law even universal and could not be used to explain the uh, parahelion procession of Mercury's orbit.\nBurn.\nIn comparison, Einstein's theory of general relativity was eventually used to solve the mercury issue.\nOh yeah, the mercury issue.\nUh, and the standard model along with the recent discovery of the Higs boson by CERN can answer the why do these two masses uh, attracted to each other question.\nI think what you mean is why are these two masses attracted to one another?\nMike, it's pretty teological.\nUh, theory is considerably more developed and richer than a scientific law which is more of a tool that is applicable to a wide range of applications.\nKeep up the good work.\nThat is Mike Dupont.\nThanks Mike.\nThanks for that.\nOf the Valley Forge DuPonts, I think so.\nHuh.\nUh, have you seen Fox Catcher?\nOh, no.\nI've heard it's good.\nIs it good?\nNo.\nOh, really?\nI don't think so.\nNo.\nI've heard it's kind of slow.\nIt's beyond slow.\nReally?\nOh, yeah.\nI, I, I can understand why.\nUm, the Academy loved it or, sure, a lot of people I'm sure do like it.\nI, I was not a fan of Fox.\nI think people generally seeing like a turn by an actor like Steve Curl doing something really different, they're knocked out by that.\nNo.\nI still can't believe.\n\n\nYou didn't like Birdman.\nNo.\nSpoiler alert for people who have not seen Birdman.\nThe following conversation is full of spoilers.\nYes.\nWhat didn't you like about it?\nUm, so I thought Michael Keane was good.\nOkay.\nUm, who plays his daughter?\nEmily Blunt.\nIs that who that is?\nUh, Emma Stone.\nEmma Stone.\nExcellent.\nOkay.\nUm, Ed Norton even pretty good.\nOkay.\nSo, the acting was fine.\nUh, who is Naomi Watts was in it?\nYeah, she did great.\nUh, okay.\nSo, yes, the acting the acting was fine.\nSure.\nI thought the acting was fine.\nUh, I thought the photography was amazing.\nYeah, the whole seemingly one take thing kind of knocked you out probably.\nI didn't even pick up on that, but yes, it did.\nUm, it was more the uh the for me the juxiposition of the story.\nMhm.\nWhich was pretty boring and and realistic in everyday life.\nEven though it was about a Broadway production, it was still about the everyday life of it.\nSure.\nAgainst the surrealism that's like threaded and embedded in throughout the whole movie.\nI didn't like that.\nOkay.\nIt was like choose one or the other, man.\nGotcha.\nIt irked me.\nUm and uh and then just so that one part with the critic where Michael Keaton tells off the critic.\nI thought Michael Keaton did a wonderful job.\nYeah.\nBut just the whole point that it was in there of like the director, you know, using Michael Keaton's character to tell off all the critics he's ever wanted to tell off in his movie.\nI just thought it was pretentious and I thought it was kind of clumsy in that sense, too.\nAnd it was enough that it it it tainted it.\nYeah.\nAnd then the ending, I did not like the ending at all.\nYeah.\nAt all.\nThat'll ruin a good movie because it was it completely went contrary to all the other stuff that he went out of his way to point out was fake or fraudulent or not real and then all of a sudden it is.\nWhat?\nYeah.\nNo.\nChoose one or the other.\nThe director refused to make very important decisions and I think that that ruined the movie.\nThat is a very well uh thoughtout criticism, I think.\nThank you.\nThank you very much.\nSure.\nUh man, that was the end of listener mail even, wasn't it?\nYeah, because now I'm not like, geez, Josh is weird.\nHe didn't like Birdman.\nNow I'm like, Josh didn't like Birdman.\nHe has good reasons.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nUm I like justifying my opinions.\nDon't we all?\nUh, so if you want to get in touch with Chuck and I, uh, or Jerry, uh, who I apparently just spoiled Birdman for, um, you can contact us via Twitter at
