  "cleanText": "Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.\n\nHey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh. There's Chuck. Here's Jerry. And we're going to take a nice little stroll down Internet Memory Lane here on Stuff You Should Know.\n\nYeah, this is something I had never heard of. Had you heard of this?\n\nNo. I ran up past Yumi and she's like, \"Oh, man. Yes, I think I've heard of it.\" I don't know if she has or not.\n\nWell, Yumi is an early adopter.\n\nYeah, she was definitely more internety than I was at that time.\n\nYeah. Um, so what we're talking about here is uh the the first what's regarded as the first social media website uh the thing that started the degradation of all mankind uh way back in 1997. It was called sixdegrees.com, uh spelled out s iixd degrees.com. It was founded by a guy named Andrew Weinreich, and for about 3 years in the late 90s uh they were able to come online when not a ton of people are online and garner ultimately about three and a half million users, which it pales in comparison to what we look at today, but for the time wasn't too bad.\n\nYeah, not too shabby. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to get them over the hump and and give them staying power. But I think they were also a victim of timing as we'll see.\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nBut yes, they they the deck was stacked against them in the fact that they were essentially very much ahead of their time. They were a social media site before there were enough people online, not just enough people to come and use your social media site. There was only something like I mean if they had three and a half million users there was probably like 3.6 million users on all of the internet at the time. I don't know if that's a correct estimate, but something like 18% of households according to the US census in 1997 when Sixdegrees.com launched, only 18% had internet at home at the time.\n\nYeah. There's a there was a competing um stat from Pew Research Center that said 36% did, but there was uh different methodologies and stuff. So let's just say you know somewhere in between those numbers. I bet it was more more like 18.\n\nUm this was you know 97 was uh 1 2 3 4 5 years before Friendster launched. That's hard to say for some reason. Mhm.\n\nUh and but by that time the percentage of people in 2002 uh that had flipped. It was more like um 39% of people did not use the internet and 61% of people did.\n\nMhm.\n\nSo it was right at that, you know, it was just terrible timing right there at the end of the 90s when the dot bubble burst. Uh and just right on its heels, other sites came along that did far far better.\n\nYeah. And just one thing, I I like that Pew data because it doesn't have like that small slice of like don't know, not sure. It's either yes, I use it or I don't use it. It's a nice solid survey.\n\nAgreed.\n\nSo, yeah. So, there's a lot of um what ifs, could have been kind of thing. Uh and we'll get into those a little bit um more, but there were more things that that um Six Degrees was up against. Another really really big one was the slow speed of internet.\n\nYeah. And you know, today you might look back and think, well, we had no comparison back then. Didn't matter. It was so slow that it would make you angry waiting around for a song to download or a a web page to even load.\n\nYeah, there were transfer speeds using dialup modems of 56 kilobytes per second. That was what you had to deal with. Not a gig per second, a kilobyte times 56 per second. That was the transfer speed at the time and that was the maximum.\n\nYeah. I mean, we've laughed about it before, but just the days of uh of just seeing a picture appear on the screen like three lines at a time, down, down, down, and you're just I just want to know what this thing looks like. And if you wanted to know, you had to sit there for five minutes or whatever.\n\nYeah. I mean, you had time to go make and eat toast. Yeah. While a picture was downloading.\n\nYeah. I ate a lot of toast back then. So that was a that was a a big challenge for it too. And then one of the other problems too as we'll see is that people I mean if you have a social media site it's kind of helpful to have pictures and they just weren't around at the time.\n\nYeah. And and we'll we'll get to that uh all the reasons why in a minute. But um just to sort of you know locate it on the timeline um in 1997 when it launched like google.com had just registered as a domain. So, it wasn't even a real thing yet. Um, the word web blog had just been coined. Uh, or you know what it would become is blog and Netflix was sending DVDs through the mail. So, I remember that.\n\nIt seems like a thousand years ago, but it wasn't that long ago in the grand scheme of things.\n\nNo. And it's kind of sad that Six Degrees has kind of gotten lost to history. Most people think Friendster was the first social media site. No, Six Degrees was. And it wasn't even one of those things where um it's technically the first social media site even though it really was not. It didn't resemble social media at all. No, this was the first social media site and it essentially laid the groundwork for all the social media sites to come. It just was so far ahead of its time that it got lost to history.\n\nYeah, for sure. Uh Friendster ultimately got about 10 million, but they had a lot of technical problems, so they didn't last. Um, MySpace was the next big one in 2003. They were the first uh to reach a million monthly active users, which was a big deal.\n\nUm, some people say that at one point it was the most popular site in the United States.\n\nI believe that.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Even if only for a brief amount of time. Um, but then in 2008, Facebook came along and and sort of smashed everything. Uh, and just to put a perspective, three and a half million users for uh Six Degrees. Facebook has more than three billion users and Blue Sky has 33 million and that's looked at as like a tiny thing.\n\nYeah, for sure. So, yeah, it kind of puts their three and a half million users into perspective.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, um Six Degrees may sound familiar to people. Um it's actually very much related to the six degrees of Kevin Bacon or uh six degrees of separation, the play by John Guare. Um, and then later the movie adaptation starring Stockard Channing, of course. Um, but it's actually, I didn't realize it's based on a study that Stanley Milgram of the very famous Milgram experiment where he um had people shock some unseen person in another room to find out just how how obedient people were to authority even against their own set of morals. You know that one, right?\n\nYeah. He also carried out a study where he was one of the first to kind of determine how far apart the average person was from the other from anybody else in the world.\n\nYeah. He got together with another uh psych professor named Jeffrey Travers and this is pretty cool. I think it was pretty um lowfi way to do it. But this is I mean what year was this? Was this the 1950s?\n\nNo, it was the late 60s.\n\nLate 60s. Okay. Um, but what they did was they said, \"All right, let's get some people in Kansas. Let's get some people in Nebraska.\" They said, \"Here's a folder and it has a document with a a target person that we want you to get this to them, but you can't just look them up and see if you can find their address and mail it to them.\" One of the people was in Cambridge, one was in uh Sharon, Massachusetts. And they said, \"What you want to do, or what we want you to do rather, is send it to a person that you personally know who you think might be able to get it to another person who could get it to another person who could eventually get it to this target person and then we will uh measure that and see what the the average or the mean might be.\" Um, so literally a farmer in Kansas um, got it, you know, this is just one example, got it to the wife of a student in Massachusetts who gave it to an Episcopalian minister in this town who gave it to an instructor at the theological seminary there who got it to that target. So that would be uh, one, two, three, four degrees of separation, which is pretty remarkable, I think.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And I also think, Chuck, that it's kind of funny that to Stanley Milgram, Nebraska and Kansas are the most socially remote locations in all of the United States because that's where he started, right? To see how long it took to get to, I guess, civilization like Boston. But, um, they actually did a lot of analysis of this. They released a a version of the study in Psychology Today, which was meant for a general audience. But then they did like the real deal in a journal called Sociometry in 1969. And they found that there was a a mean length um mean is the one in the middle. No, mean is average. It's another word for average. Just say average, you know. Um of 4.4 to 5.7 intermediaries. So they found that people have a degree of separation of 4.4 to 5.7 and this was all the way back in the mid to late 60s. Think about how closer we are now.\n\nYeah. Well, what I wonder too is did they throw out the ones because apparently most of the folders never even made it. Did they just toss those and say of the ones who got there, this is how they're connected?\n\nUm, yes. But I believe that most of the ones that didn't get there were because the initial farmers in Kansas and Nebraska just threw them out. They didn't participate.\n\nOh, really? I think that's what happened to the majority of them. So yeah, it wasn't like the most robust study of all time, but it was so fascinating that it just captured the imagination of people and became kind of a pop cultural meme. But what's interesting about it is that later scholarship that was pretty robust studies supported what Milgram and uh his um collaborator Jeffrey Travers found in that study. Yeah, there was one in 2003 that found a median of 5 to seven. Um, this is pretty old data, but in 2011 uh they did the degrees of separation on other social media sites and for Facebook at the time it was 4.74 and for the uh at the time named Twitter it was 4.67.\n\nUm, but the caveat there is like you're not necessarily counting just the people that you know. Like I know plenty of people when I was on Facebook that had lots of like uh what were they in Facebook? Friends.\n\nMhm.\n\nYeah. Friends who they they had no idea who they were. It was just more of a maybe a networking thing kind of like LinkedIn.\n\nYeah, for sure. And as we'll see, Sixdegrees.com, too.\n\nYeah. Um Yeah. Uh Laura, Dr. Claw, who helped us out with this points out that social media kind of has a stretch the definition of what we consider a connection, like you just said.\n\nAnd also, you said what used to be called Twitter. I think it's hilarious because very frequently you'll see Twitter used in like some sort of article or whatever and then in parenthesis after that it'll say X.\n\nYeah. And I mean everyone still says Twitter it seems like.\n\nYeah. It just didn't take like sorry the the name change for the business you bought did not take.\n\nYeah. It's cuz X is dumb.\n\nI guess so. And Twitter was just so perfect I guess. Well, I mean, I don't know if Twitter's a good name or not, but it had such uh recognition. It's just like, yeah,\n\nit's like the people who bought the Sears Tower and tried to change the name and everybody's like, \"Nope, still Sears Tower. Sorry.\"\n\nYeah. I love that when a corporate sponsor takes over and they're like, \"No, we're still going to call it the thing it was before.\n\nIt's still the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Sorry.\n\nSorry. Cars.com.\"\n\nUh, well, you mentioned Kevin Bacon. Uh, and we should mention real quick, the six degrees of Kevin Bacon was a very popular thing created by some college students where and the idea is that Kevin Bacon has been in so many varied movies over the years that you can connect any actor in Hollywood uh to Kevin Bacon in less than in six degrees or less. Mhm.\n\nUm but the Bacon number apparently is 3.12 and they're um 522 actors who have a a smaller connectivity number or bacon number than that?\n\nYeah, there more connected to people than Kevin Bacon. I didn't know that. Chuck, did you?\n\nYeah. Well,\n\nthat there were 522 or that there were more connected actors?\n\nBoth. I mean, I figured there were more connected actors because there were people, well, Eric Roberts is is the number one with 2.90841 because he has 865 uh IMDb entries as an actor. So, I figured there were people that were in way more movies and that's just math, you know.\n\nSure, it is. But also, you can make an a case that Kevin Bacon's 111 movies typically are with more stars who have more work. So they're it's likelier that the people he work with are in more movies with more other people whereas Eric Roberts is probably in movies with people like this is their one and only movie or people who are in like 600 movies that you just have never heard of.\n\nThat's true too. That's possible. If RiftTrax taught me anything, it's that if like I I know who Cameron Mitchell is for Pete's sake.\n\nWho's that?\n\nHe's one of those guys who's in a million movies that you've never heard of.\n\nBut you recognize his face. face name.\n\nYeah, I think I actually know some of his family members now, right? I'm gonna have to look this guy up.\n\nYeah. Oh, man. It will take you on an odyssey. And don't even bother watching the original version of the movies. Just watch the RiftTrax version of Cameron Mitchell's movies.\n\nUh, a rare in store or in show. Look up Cameron Mitchell. Huh? Oh, no. He's a restaurant tour.\n\nIt's not him.\n\nLook up Cameron Mitchell. Space Mutiny.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know that guy.\n\nWas he in Plan Nine?\n\nMaybe. He really might have been.\n\nWell, and now I'm seeing a picture of him as an older gentleman. And I've seen him in movies as an older gentleman, too.\n\nSpeaking of Space Mutiny, that's a really great riff tracks to start with. Those guys\n\n\nAre the best.\nAnd wait, actually, I think that's a\nMST3K to start. Watch that. Watch both\nversions. How about that?\nAll right. Well, that's what I meant.\nBut yeah.\nUm, okay. So, do you want to take a\nbreak, Chuck? Yeah, let's take a break\nand talk more about old internet right\nafter this.\n[Music]\nOkay, Chuck. So, we said we were going\nto take a stroll down internet memory\nlane. Um, and this was a time when like\nI think the year before Sixdegrees.com\nlaunched, Craigslist launched,\nAmazon.com launched and they were just\nselling books at the time.\nYeah. Um, one of the big search engines\nwas Ask Jeeves and it was revolutionary\nbecause you could use natural language\nrather than have to figure out exactly\nwhat keyword you needed to put in to get\nresults like with\nLIOS. Yeah. Yeah, totally.\nUm, which by the way, Ask Jeeves is\nask.com now. Did you know that?\nUh, I think I did know that. I knew it\nchanged into something.\nWell, it changed.\nThey just got rid of Jeeves, which is\nsuper sad.\nI know. It is pretty sad. They they\nretired him. He went off to live on a\nfarm as they say.\nYeah.\nWhich means they killed him.\nUh how Sixdegrees.com worked though is\ninteresting because not only was it um\nthe name coped from Six Degrees of\nSeparation, they actually organized the\nwebsite in such a way. Uh and it seemed\nlike part of the fun of it, and again\nthis is early internet. If you're if\nyou're a youngster out there, you may\nthink this is super funny that people\nthought this was fun.\nMhm. But it seems like part of the fun\nof Sixdegrees.com\nwas finding people you didn't know and\nthen tracing that connection through the\nwebsite,\nright? Um so one of the things that you\nwould do is go through the um I guess\nthe registry of other Sixdegrees.com\nusers and there were so few initially that you\ncould do that rather than go through\nthree and a half million people. It was\njust a few hundred potentially and you'd\nbe like oh I know them. I know them and\nyou would make a connection with them.\nThey would confirm it and now you were a\nfirst-degree connection YouTuber because\nyou actually know each other, right?\nYeah. And you, like you said, you had to\nconfirm that connection, but you could\nalso include people who weren't on it\nyet. Like, I'm just going to list out my\nfamily members or whatever and put their\nemail addresses in.\nKeep in mind, this is at a time where\nyou didn't get a lot of email. You\ndidn't get much, if any, spam email. And\nsometimes getting an email was like,\n\"Oh, wow. Look at this. This is cool.\nIf you think about that now, like, oh\nyeah, just put all your family and\nfriends and put their emails in. That's\nlike a a fireable offense,\nright?\nLike socially,\nyou can go to jail.\nI think you can, but back then it was a\ndifferent deal. So, um, you can include\npeople, put their emails, and they would\nget an email asking for confirmation and\nsaying, \"And also, do you want to sign\nup for this cool new thing?\"\nNo.\nYeah. Exactly. Um, so the people that\nknew the people you knew, but you\nweren't directly connected to them, you\nwere now second-degree connected with\nthem. And then those people were\nconnected to people that you didn't\nknow, and they were third-degree\nconnections. I think it didn't go beyond\nthird degree. Like they didn't go all\nthe way up to six. I think that was\ntotally unnecessary.\nMhm. Um, but this was like, yeah, this\nwas very groundbreaking and\nrevolutionary and people were just\namazed by people they knew and and the\npoint was like, who do your friends know\nthat you want to know that you don't\nknow yet? Now you can make a first-degree\nconnection with those people if they\nconfirm you.\nYeah. I mean, that's the way it was sort\nof like a predecessor to LinkedIn. I\nmean, you'll see again, like you said,\nlike seeds of all the social media\nwebsites. They were doing it.\nUm, because you could create a profile\nwith your professional affiliations and\nstuff like that.\nUm, you were encouraged and I think most\npeople probably really did use their\nreal identities because at the time\npeople were like, well, what kind of a\nweirdo would just create some fake\nidentity on the internet just to mess\nwith people? So there were real people\non there um that was a member of the uh\ntrustee e data privacy program which is\nnow uh been bundled up under trust arc.\nMhm.\nUh but email was very central to it all.\nIt was not an app. They didn't have apps\nyet. Uh you would get an email asking\nfor confirmation. You would reply via\nemail. You would add others via email.\nSo it was just a different time.\nYeah. And there were um I mean you would\nadd your hobbies, you would add who you\nworked for, um what degrees you had\nmaybe. So yeah, again lots of seeds of\nLinkedIn for sure. Again, no pictures\nand this was a huge stumbling block as\nwe'll see. Um but they did have other\nfunctionality that was thrilling. It had\nbasically in network emailing, right? So\nyou could directly contact your contacts\nhad they confirmed you. um their\nbulletin boards where you could\nessentially chat. Um and I think they\nhad a bunch of other kind of bells and\nwhistles that they added over the years.\nUm they had something called channels\nwhich were essentially special interest\ngroups and you could be like, \"Oh, I'm\ninterested in business and finance or\nI'm interested in games.\" I think\nmeaning at the time nothing but Oregon\nTrail, right? Um, and you could just go\nand find other people on these message\nboards that were interested in these\nthings and maybe make some contacts if\nthey confirmed you.\nYeah. Again, way ahead of its time uh\nwith Facebook groups. That's exactly\nwhat they did. Um, we got some uh and\nyou can go look these up if you want to\nsee like screenshots of what the screen\nlooked like. Um, I believe we were sent\none from October 1999, a welcome screen.\nUhhuh.\nScream screen. Uh, and it was it was\ncute. It looked like a a a fun website\nof the day. It had a service\nmarketplace. There was daily trivia on\nthe homepage. Uh there was this is\nhysterical. There was a daily poll. And\non that day in October 1999, this was\nthe poll.\nWhen you get a chain letter from a\nfriend, you a immediately throw it away,\nb do what it says ASAP, c hold on to it\nfor a while, and then lose it. So it's\nclearly they weren't like super future\nfacing if they were like chain letters.\nThat's relatable. Right.\nRight.\nI found one also, Chuck, from February\n29th, 2000. So that was a leap year. Um,\nit was the the question of the day was\nBill and Monica. And then your your\nchoices were love, lust, and as long as\nit's not Hillary.\nThat was the question of the day.\nThat's pretty funny. Um, by that time,\nsix or eight months after the October\none that was sent, um, and probably in\nthe February uh, one that you saw, they\nwere there were little nuggets of\nengagement boosting that they were\ntrying to use like, hey, here's some\ncontent, here's some like join this\nMother's Day group or we're going to\nspotlight this channel. Um they had it\nwas they would tell how many people were\nonline at that moment which\nuh in the October of 1999 it was uh 510\npeople which sounds very funny but I\ndistinctly remember being in like chat\nrooms where they would say like like 300\npeople are in there and I would it would\nblow my mind\nthat there were that many.\nYeah. It just seemed like, \"Oh my god,\ndude. I'm in my living room in New\nJersey and I'm on this computer and\nthere are 300 people around the world\nthat I can talk to right now.\"\nThat's neat. And what did you say?\nWell, I I did have one specific\ninteraction with uh someone, of course,\nat the time. I thought it was a real\ngirl about our love of Cat Stevens.\nUhhuh.\nAnd we had a real back and forth going\nand a lot in common. And I'm sure that\nwas probably a nine-year-old boy.\nYou got catfished over Cat Stevens. I\nmight have. Who knows? But I remember\nthinking like, \"Hey man, this girl\nsounds super cool and there are no\npictures, so I bet, you know, she's cute\nas far as I know.\"\nWell, a nine-year-old boy who's into Cat\nStevens is probably pretty cool, too.\nYeah, that probably would have been a\nbetter online friend\nto chat about real music,\nright? Um, another thing I saw on that\nFebruary 2000 page was the theme of the\nweek. And this theme was to thine own\nself improve. So there was like you\ncould click on to Zen practice group.\nYeah. Self-help\nfunue raiki. There was a book club. Um\nthey were just throwing everything they\ncould\nYeah.\nat this to just get people to interact\nmore and more and more because um it\nwould you the the more engaged you were\nthe more likely you were to send out\nthose emails to your friends and be\nlike, \"Hey, join me on here.\" It's\npretty awesome.\nSo maybe let's talk about pictures real\nquick and then we'll take a break\nbecause the lack of pictures is a big\ndeal especially when you look at the\nmodern internet. Uh a website with just\ntext and maybe you know uh clip art and\nstuff like that isn't super engaging\nobviously. So the reason why they didn't\nhave pictures is because there was no\nway to get pictures there. You know\nthere weren't digital cameras. the um\nthere was the Apple QuickTake 100 that\nwas released a few years before. Uh if\nyou look up pictures of this, it's about\nthe size of a sandwich. Kind of funny\nlooking. Um it was the first digital\ncamera. It cost 750 bucks. Uh the Canon\nPowersShot was the first digital camera\nthat could write images to a hard disk.\nThat was released uh kind of one Yeah.\none year before um Sixdegrees.com came\nonline in 1996. That was almost $1,000.\nhad 176 megs of storage.\nBut the first camera phone didn't come\nalong until 99. And that was uh uh Kya\nVisual Phone VP210.\nYeah, it was actually cheap considering\nit's 634 bucks in today's dollars for a\ncamera phone. It was an 111 megapixel\ncamera. For comparison, the iPhone 16\nhas as much as 48 megapixels.\nYeah. But if you look up some of like\nthe um the promotional images of this,\nthere's like um uh like Japanese women\nholding the phone that's showing a\npicture of themselves. You can clearly\nsee who it is.\nYes, that's another word for it. I'm\nusing 1997 terminology though.\nUm they like you can see you can tell\nit's them. I think one version of it is\nin color. It's not that bad\nespecially for 600.\nYou can tell it's them. Yeah, you don't\nhave to like like squint your eyes to\nmake the pixels come together and you're\nlike, \"Is that Popeye?\"\nUm, it's like you can tell it's them, I\nguess. I I was impressed by it.\nSo, it did its most basic function as an\nimage capturing device.\nYes.\nBeing able to tell it was that thing,\nright? Oh, one other thing I saw about\nthe Apple QuickTake 100, at its highest\nresolution, it could store up to eight\nphotos at once.\nWhoa.\nThis is so much fun. And I love making\nfun of the early internet.\nI know that we live through. Um this is\nalso a true story. Uh Winre, the\nfounder, uh would get emails where\npeople would say, \"Hey, can I snail mail\nyou a physical photo?\nI have it. Can you can I send it to you\nvia the US Postal Service and can you\nscan it and attach it to my profile\nbecause you really need pictures on this\nthing?\"\nRight? And they were like, \"Maybe.\" And\nthen somebody around the the table at\nthe bowl session said, \"Well, wait, what\nif people want to start like updating or\nchanging their photos?\" And Andrew Wine,\nI think it's Wine Reich, maybe said,\n\"Yeah, let's just skip that.\"\nAll right.\nOkay. No, no, I'm saying Wine Rich said\nthat, not us.\nOh, yeah. Yeah.\nWell, there's like a rare inshow edit\nthat didn't get edited on purpose.\nShould we take that break now?\nI feel like we need to. Yes.\nAll right. I'm gonna go do 20 push-ups\nfor that and I'll be right back.\n[Music]\nAll\nright. So, wineer. It's wine rich.\nWine. Wine rich. I think\nwine rich.\nOkay. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's how\num I think it was Wikipedia that had the\npronunciation and I think it said\nWininrich.\nOkay. All right. Maybe he was trying to\nseem less German,\nright? Yeah. That always reminds me of\num that part in 30 Rock where um Tina\nFay is like, \"Well, she's apologizing\nand she said, I'm very sorry, like Mr.\nViner Slav.\" And he said, \"It's wiener\nslave.\nThat's such a good joke, man. It is.\nHave you ever seen um Unbreakable Kimmy\nSchmidt? Have you seen that yet?\nUh I watched it when it I mean when it\ncame out years ago, I watched the first\nlike season or so.\nThere aren't that many shows that can\nmake me actually laugh out loud and\nthat's one of them. And it's because\nTina Bay is one of the the best comedy\nwriters to ever live.\nYeah, agreed. Uh I don't Have you seen\nThe Four Seasons yet?\nNo, I'm avoiding it. I saw that it's a\nremake of an Allen Alda film and I have\na strict policy not to watch late 70s\nearly al early early 80s Allen all the\nfilms or their remakes.\nOh god, your distaste for Alen Alda is\ntruly disturbing.\nThe thing is I've got nothing against\nAlan Alda. Um, personally it's those\nkind of movies. Same with Elliot G.\ncan't stand those kind of movies like\nwhere it's just like like hey\nI can't even do an impression of it but\nI can't stand those kind of movies and\nand somebody out there knows what I'm\ntalking about\nElliot Gold kind of movies\nyes whether it's Capricorn 1 or that\nShaggy Dog movie that he's in um where\nhe plays the detective\nuh I will say that one movie I think you\nwould like is the long goodbye\nthat's the one I'm talking about. That's\nthe Shaggy Dog Detective one. I don't\nthink I would.\nWhat does Shaggy Dog detective mean? I\ndon't understand what that mean.\nUm, so Shaggy Dog is where like there's\nthis whole buildup of like say a mystery\nor something and it turns out to be\nnothing. Like there's really no point to\nthe movie at in the end.\nOh, okay.\nSo,\nwow. I\n\n\nI thought you would like The Long Goodbye. Great Robert Altman uh noir to me.\nNo. And I like Robert Altman stuff, too.\nRaymond Chandler book. No. Still nothing. Huh?\nI I wouldn't if if you made it. No, I can't wait. If you made it before Elliot Gould was in it, I would probably watch it.\nAll right, fair enough. Um, wait, one more thing.\nYeah. Yeah.\nSpeaking of um, great directors, I finally saw Ghost Dog, Way of the Samurai by Darmish. Did you see that ever?\nI saw that in the theater, buddy.\nI was guessing that you had. That is such a good movie, man. I can't believe that slipped under my radar because that totally was in my wheelhouse for that that time.\nYeah. Yeah. Dash is the best. And Forest Whitaker was so good in that.\nYes, he was. Good music, too.\nYeah.\nAll right. Uh, where how did that start?\nWinerre trying to seem less German. This is the six degrees of that conversation, I guess.\nMr. Wiener Slave.\nYeah. Wiener Slave. So, here's what uh Winri I guess.\nThere's one other thing that reminds me of, too. You remember we were talking about the vanity license plate episode.\nYeah.\nUhhuh. or um and like the greatest misconstrued vanity plate of all time is where the guy had J is Lord like Jesus is Lord but it's all one word so it says Jiz Lord.\nJ Lord.\nThat's the greatest vanity plate anyone's ever had.\nThat definitely beats ass, man, even.\nI think so too, which is a good one.\nYeah, that it's really funny.\nLower, especially taking it in the context it was originally there.\nExactly.\nYeah. Like who that guy was to be that, you know, dedicated of a a Christian to do that on your license plate and that's what you end up with.\nRolling up to church with Jiz Lord on your car.\nMan, you can make a movie about that.\nYeah, you could. With starring Elliot Gould as the Jiz Lord. So Wininrich said uh and this is a quote that just kind of shows how far ahead of his time he was, his vision uh it is abundantly clear to me that the world will index all of their relations, everyone's relationship in a single database and that was like before anyone else is doing it. So they started off this thing as a um just with a launch like a physical launch event, a party in New York City. They had 200 invited guests and those were the first 200 members and they were like now you all go out and and make this a thing by inviting your friends.\nSo I'm I'm curious like who those 200 people were. That's pretty interesting way to start a site like this. I think there were a lot of techsavvy people who were kind of like probably primed to to take part in this to begin with.\nAnd I think at first they were adding like 50 new users a day.\nWow.\nWhich again that's really small and I think even for the time this was pretty small but they're doing this through like email and stuff, you know, like it's it's really it's a weird transfer from online world to real world. that straddled both because it had to.\nAnother good example of that is um that uh they would use reps to go to campus to sign people up just like that same credit card model that that credit card companies use to um screw college kids parents out of $1,000.\nYeah. I remember I had the uh MX College card and the only reason I got it, I didn't even really want or need a credit card, but um you got three Delta flight vouchers. Oh, uh, when you signed up for that card.\nSo, I got three plane flights.\nSo, where did you go?\nI don't remember. Well, I do remember cuz I know I went to LA for the first time to visit my brother when he lived there.\nNice.\nWhen I was in college.\nDid you go visit the uh six or nine-year-old Cat Stevens fan?\nI did. And that was a 75year-old woman.\nWow. Man, that story goes all over the place.\nYeah. It took a quite a weird turn, but we're still good friends. She's still around with us. She's 102. Oh, really?\nYeah.\nThat's cool, man. Does she listen to the podcast or is she like, \"No, only Cat Stevens all the time.\"\nThat would get kind of old, I think.\nSo, let's talk about the end of this thing because as we all know, it's not still around. Um although Dr. Claw said if you went there, it had a homepage. I went there and I got a error.\nGateway Timeout. The old 504.\nSame here. The old 504.\nYeah. I I But it's there. It's if if it weren't a domain that was active, it would come back as like, \"Hey, you want to buy this domain?\"\nBut it doesn't do that. It just is so slow that you can't connect to it. But it does seem to be there. Sixdegrees.com. Sure.\nYeah. I mean, considering the the public knowledge of just that term, it's um like you try go to try going out these days and getting a better domain name, you know?\nYou can't do it.\nYou just can't. Uh don't feel too bad for Winrich or Reich or Rick because he sold uh in 1999 for 120 125 million in stock options in youth stream media networks. Uh, but this, you know, you you know that if you know anything about internet history, you know that this thing shut down in 99 and what that meant that com bubble right there on the horizon in 2000, shut down more websites than you could shake a stick at.\nYeah. And actually, you can feel pretty bad for Winri because he took that $125 million in stock in a company that folded like months later because it was debt financed. So I don't know how much he actually walked away with, especially if there was possibly a blackout in him selling those stock options.\nOh, so yeah. Yet what you're saying is Youth Stream itself also went under.\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. Uh because they were just borrowing, borrowing, borrowing, and that's how they existed. And then when the when the dot bubble burst, they were worth nothing. And so that stock was worth nothing. I I looked I couldn't find how much he actually did make from that sale like in real.\nYou can never find that out.\nNo. And that usually means that it's not a very good amount. Yeah, they like to leak that stuff when it's like eyepopping, but when it's not, they're like, \"Oh, I don't remember.\"\nYeah, good point. Um, the other problem was it was very early in the internet and that monetization was a real struggle. Um, they had some ads, of course. Uh, I believe their question of the day had an actual sponsor. Uh, but it was just a little bit too early. Um, like right after they fell off, Frenster came along. that also failed again. But then MySpace and Facebook just just on the heels of this uh he did make some other dough off of it. I think um the patent that he had with six degrees for the software for the platform he sold for 700,000 real dollars to the CEO of LinkedIn.\nUhhuh.\nUh and the CEO Mark Pinkis of a website called Tribe and they were both Finster investors.\nYeah. and Reed Hoffman and he said he and Mark Pinkis were like essentially fans like they were like Wininrich is a god here. He he this patent not only is for the software it's for the methodology of creating an online social network. No one had ever come up with something like that before. So they actually kind of bought it for a song. I looked and uh LinkedIn is apparently definitively not built on six degrees architecture or and it never was. But it almost seems like they were either taking it to learn from it or almost like they were buying like some um memorabilia that they were like fans of. I almost got that impression from an interview with Reed Hoffman.\nOh, very interesting. Um he Andrew Wininrike went on to do you know a lot of more things like this. He's kind of a serial entrepreneur. Uh, and again, he it seems like he was always uh right there before the real thing came along. Uh, because he had something called uh, Meet Mua, as in Mi, uh, French for me, right?\nYeah.\nYeah. I I thought so. I was just making sure. Uh, but that was a location-based dating app. And it was basically this idea that like, hey, dating app or dating websites are really tough even at the time of the early internet. and like let's at least connect people who are physically close and it might be easier to get real dates. Uh the dating part of that business was bought by the parent company of match.com once again just right there next to the thing.\nUh and he and his Mima co-founder bought out the business analytics part of their own company and use it to found a data analytics company called Indicative which is still around from what I can tell and\nAll right. So maybe he's done all right there.\nYeah. And so this was I mean this was very early 2000s too and they were like they were using track like location tracking data um at the time and that was huge and new and so they kept that I think they ended up either selling it or licensing it it to a company called Xify not a very good name they should call it Twitterify.\nYeah. And they had some like high-profile clients. They had Ritz Carlton. They had Staples. They had Sephora Publishers Clearing House.\nYeah. So they were but they were using those location apps to advertise to you and send you push notifications on your phone which sadly means that Andrew Wininrich is going to be going to hell for that.\nI mean did he create that idea? I wonder he's he he gave or he sold Xify the the the ability to do that. So and then IBM bought them, right?\nYeah. So I'm not sure how much he made from these buyouts. I hope a lot because again this guy is like coming up with ideas and making stuff happen long before they can become viable and a lot of people probably have gotten very rich off the back of his ideas too. So I hope he's doing well. Maybe if he's listening or someone knows him through their degrees of uh connectivity just uh get to him and have him email us at stuffodcastia.com and just send us your bank statement.\nThat's right. So we'll know. I want to specify by doing well. I don't mean just financially. I mean I hope his well-being, his sense of well-being is nice and inflated and happy and you know that he's he's living a good life.\nNo, I agree. I cheapened it by making it financial and that's why you're the heart of the show.\nYeah, that's me. I'm the one you're not supposed to touch. Remember?\nOh, well, you know what I mean.\nOh, one thing that I did see that he's doing now is um a podcast called Predicting Our Future. It's about what life is going to be like in the fairly near future. Pretty cool.\nFantastic.\nUm, so Chuck, I think there's that's it for six degrees.com. We got 40 minutes out of it.\nHey, not bad. Lots of fun stories in in between.\nYeah. And what did you just say in between, right?\nMhm.\nWell, then that means it's time for listener mail.\nBoy, I'm glad I always know the trigger word.\nYeah, it's it's amazing. You never fail each episode. Go me. Y.\nUh, hey guys. I'm a 40some man with autism who lives on his own and the need for impression management hit close home. So, this was I remember about we even speculated about impression management.\nMhm.\nThat we might hear from uh some people with autism.\nThis was a great email.\nIt's a great This is a Josh curated even uh I simply cannot match the body language of others and have to fake it. I don't instinctively smile or look angry. People say I have an almost disturbing calm demeanor. Being calm sounds great, but it has gotten me searched for additional screening at 20 airports and even strip searched at one. Uh, when people grill you for questioning, a straight answer without fear frustrates the hell out of people whose job it is to make you feel uncomfortable. To help mask my autism, I wear sunglasses to hide my eyes. And because of that, I've gotten the nickname Terminator. A flat affect direct language doesn't help either. Uh, discrimination is very real, guys. But I like to say getting angry at a person with autism who doesn't adhere to societal norms is like getting angry at a person with one leg that doesn't run marathons.\nHopefully people uh who listen will give people with a bit of a quirk some slack. Uh, thanks from a longtime listener.\nThat is Matt.\nI'm glad Matt wrote that one in. That was a good good um email and I think he probably speaks for a lot of people in that situation. Totally a good reminder to everybody and something that like we talked about on that episode as as we've gotten older we try to sort of think about not just that but what everyone's going through in their life and maybe they're not having their best day when you meet them you know.\nYep. Too true, Chuck. Too true. Uh if you want to be like Matt and send us a worldclass email, we would love that.
