  "cleanText": "Hey everyone, Chuck here. If you're wondering why you have, uh, suddenly 10 new episodes in your feed, it's because we thought we might group things together and try a little playlist here for the summer and see how it went. And in this case, we're covering summer movies or movies in general. And I am setting up our, uh, semi-recent episode from, oh, I guess it's not that recent. It's from April 2011 on exploitation films and how they work. It was a really fun one to do. And if you love cinema and you love movies, and if you love exploitation movies especially, you're going to love this episode. So, please enjoy.\n\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know from howstuffworks.com.\n\n[Music]\n\nHang on there, fella. Oh, yes. I know what we're doing. Go ahead. Get us going here. Well, Chuck, the other night, um, you may have noticed, um, I know you did because I watched you watch this, which is kind of creepy, but not really. Um, you and I were on TV.\n\nYeah.\n\nOn the Science Channel.\n\nYeah. We did the little shorts. Uh, and, uh, we're actually proud of how these turned out, which is a rarity for us when it's when there's a camera.\n\nIt is. So, um, we have, uh, more shorts coming up on Science Channel. They're running Saturdays and Sundays, um, until I think the first week of May or something, right?\n\nYes. And now they, they're all running between 10:00 and 10:30 now, supposedly.\n\nOkay.\n\nDuring the shows, I think on Saturdays is Oddities.\n\nWoo!\n\nWhich is an awesome and weird show.\n\nIt is.\n\nAnd then Sundays, which is Firefly, which is, you know, everyone loves Firefly.\n\nYeah. I mean, I actually consider it an honor to be played during Firefly.\n\nYeah, me too.\n\nEven though the cast of Firefly has no idea that this is going on because it's pre-recorded.\n\nExactly, Josh. So, this, uh, what's today? Thursday, obviously.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh, Saturday and Sunday night, this weekend on the Science Channel.\n\nMhm.\n\nUh, that is the Science Channel. It's part of the Discovery Networks between 10 and 10:30, set your little DVR, and then look, they run, uh, during the commercial breaks.\n\nOr if you're not so fancy that you have a DVR, you can actually watch it as it happens.\n\nThat's right. And we are able to run a few of these online now. Not the ones that are on TV, but there are three, uh, funny ones if you know how to navigate to the video page of howstuffworks.com.\n\nDo that, or you can just type in how stuffuffs video into Google, and it'll take you straight to the video page.\n\nYou could also search, um, Stuff You Should Know: Large Hadron Collider, Stuff You Should Know: Body Farms, and Stuff You Should Know: Mirror Neurons, right, on a search engine, and it should take you right there.\n\nThat's right. And if it doesn't, you tell us, and we will talk to those search engines.\n\nAnd if you just get to the video page, you can search, uh, Stuff You Should Know and search videos, and it'll bring up that and a couple of other little funny things we've done.\n\nYeah. So, that's it. We just tacked like 10 minutes onto this episode.\n\nI know. We, we appreciate your support.\n\nWho mine?\n\nNo.\n\nOh, everyone that wants to watch these.\n\nAgreed.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay. So, you ready? Okay. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. This is Stuff You Should Know, the podcast and kind of a special edition. Frankly, I am a little excited, Chuck. I'm a little giddy.\n\nShut your mouth. That's Yeah. Okay. Sure. All right. Um, this is, uh, this is our first ever movie-centric podcast, right?\n\nMovie-centric for sure.\n\nYeah. We've mentioned, uh, movies of, of course, all the time, but this one is like, this is all about movies.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, so this is by, by popular request to an extent. People want to see like, um, uh, want, they, they want to hear us talk about movies and just do a movie podcast. So, we decided to focus on exploitation films.\n\nThat's right. This is also probably the first podcast that we're going to say if you are a teacher of children in, uh, 8th grade or younger and you're using this as a teaching tool, you might want to go to the one before this or the one after.\n\nYeah, we don't generally try to alienate audiences. We're not attempting to now. It's just a natural byproduct of the exploitation film.\n\nCan't talk about exploitation films without talking about some lurid subject matter.\n\nYeah. You can't say exploitation without ploy.\n\nYeah. They weren't exploiting just people being nice, right? Nice exploitation.\n\nSo, Chuck, I went and saw a movie the other day called I Saw the Devil. It's a Korean movie. It's by the guy who did, um, The Tale of Two Sisters, I think. Oh, you said more violent than Old Boy.\n\nYeah, the, the guy Old Boy is one of the main characters. And I've seen Old Boy. I've seen, um, uh, what's the other one he did? The vampire movie.\n\nYeah.\n\nThirst, something. I think it's pretty good. It was okay. Um, this one is, it's the most violent thing I've ever seen in my life. It's the most graphically violent movie I've ever seen in my life. Um, the only, the only reason it, like, I was able to complete is because I'm like, this is it's a movie. I, I know, right? But I walked out of it like, it's so over the top. It's so gory. It's clearly an exploitation film.\n\nYeah.\n\nAlive and well.\n\nYeah. But the problem is, is like, really, if you start to look around, John Hughes films technically are exploitation films. The Breakfast Club is technically an exploitation film.\n\nYeah.\n\nThere was a big wave of teen exploitation films, and we'll get to that, but yeah, you're right.\n\nSo, one of the broader definitions of exploitation films is basically anything that's really like over the top that is beyond reality, um, or that maybe focuses on people's fears, um, uh, their, their sexuality. Yeah. Um, and basically just kind of serves it up in a larger-than-life manner. That's one way of looking at exploitation films.\n\nYeah. You're basically, they're exploiting, um, some of the seedier, uh, aspects of humanity most times.\n\nSure.\n\nLike murder or sex, like, um, weird sex, that kind of thing.\n\nYeah, exactly. Sex. Weird sex. Teenagers rebelling against parents.\n\nSure. That kind of thing. Like weird science. Have you ever been to a party where a couch shot out of the chimney and into the pond? I mean, it's a pretty nice party. I don't think it's ever really happened, you know.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, so that's the vast definition of exploitation, but you and I are, um, kind of qualified to teach a sim cinema class at like maybe a, a low-level community college at this point after the amount of research we've done in this. Sure. And we found that academically there's a, there's a much more distinct, um, definition for exploitation, and it's seemingly interchangeable term, grindhouse, right?\n\nYeah. What's the, is there a definition?\n\nIt's, it's more like a time frame.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo, from like 1919 when they really first started making movies to, I think, 1960, 1959 when the Hayes Act went away.\n\nYeah. Well, that was exploitation, and then after that, it was, it became Grindhouse.\n\nOkay. Gotcha.\n\nThat's my understanding.\n\nOkay. So, let's do this. All right. Hey. Well, that's the old joke was that, uh, in, in the awesome documentary American Grindhouse, which documents this, this era of film making. Yeah. The old joke, one of the guys says is that, um, exploitation films began 5 minutes after the camera was invented, the motion picture camera, because the guy was like, the director was like to his girlfriend, \"Hey, would you mind taking your clothes off of the camera?\"\n\nExactly. So, it says something about the human condition that, uh, you invent the film camera, and the first moving images were often lured. Um, Edison's film, it showed clips of like decapitations and violence and guys fighting. Yeah. And naked women, um, as film tests. So, it's just that says a lot about people, like, all right, now we know how to capture things, so let's capture sex and violence, right, first. Right. And, um, although that really kind of jived with public tastes or at least public fascination, uh, it didn't jive with the, uh, prevailing standards, the agreed-upon standards.\n\nRight.\n\nRight. Uh, I think you said 1919, but the first exploitation film was 1913.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nUh, Traffic in Souls or While New York Sleeps.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd that, like you said, exploitation often plays into fears. That played into the fear at the time of the white slave trade, right?\n\nUh, budget of 57 grand and gross $450,000, which 1913, that's a lot of dough.\n\nThat is a ton of dough.\n\nAnd that was Universal Pictures. And they went, \"Hey, got on to something here.\" Right after that was released, the Hayes Code, um, Will Hayes was the postmaster general and a Presbyterian elder. Um, and he was making a hundred grand a year during the depression.\n\nThat's unbelievable, right?\n\nHe, uh, he basically said, like, look, we need, um, we need to apply some moral standards to film making. There's decapitation, there's naked breast, there's, there's white, white slavery. Like, we need to, we need to pure this up, right? Well, actually, there, there wasn't nudity yet. Like, those early test films, there were, but nudity, we'll get to that later.\n\nOkay. Uh, but yes, that's what Hayes tried to do. And like, um, prohibition didn't exactly quell drinking. Um, the haze code actually sort of gave rise to the exploitation movement.\n\nYeah. It's just like, just like prohibition, just like marijuana prohibition, just like, well, any drug prohibition. Anytime you say you can't do this, you can't have something that you want, somebody else is going to operate in a black market. A black market's going to spring up. Simple economics.\n\nYeah. And that's exactly what happened. And that's where exploitation cinema came up. It's like, you can't get this from Hollywood because Hollywood has to play by the rules. But my production studio is my Model T, and let's go make this movie. Give me some money. I'm going to film a child being born close up and put it in the movies.\n\nYes. And you can do that. You can make your movies all day long, but if they're never exhibited, then what good are you doing? Or not like they were trying to do some good, but you're not making any scratch. So, uh, the 40 thieves, they talk about in the, in the documentary, were these, uh, filmmakers and exhibitors basically that traveled around like carnese, uh, setting up these sort of guerrilla film screenings and some places sort of out of the way where they can't get caught. And that was, uh, for the first time, you know, they were taking films outside of the mainstream.\n\nYeah.\n\nDifferent, sometimes they weren't even theaters. They would show them in like VFW halls. And if you want to go see Birth of a Baby films, apparently they were popular.\n\nYeah. That was a whole genre, early genre of exploitation.\n\nWell, and so was, um, early on a lot of the, um, films centered around, uh, like how to wear a condom in these sex hygiene films.\n\nYeah. Because there was no information about that out there. And so exploitation filmmakers, whether, um, disingenuously or genuinely, um, were presenting their stuff like, this is a public service. People need to know this, right? And, and making movies about it. But it also, and people were going on that excuse as well, like, well, I need to, I need to know about this, but at the same time, it's like, I want to see this, the, the craziest thing I'll ever see in my life.\n\nExactly. You know, on screen.\n\nOr they argued a lot of times that they were cautionary tales. If they were about drugs or violence, they would say, hey, this could happen to you. Yeah. So, you should educate yourself. But what they really want to do is get their movie seen and make some money.\n\nExactly.\n\nUm, Paramount decision of 1948. This is pretty big. The, uh, Supreme Court voted that movie studios could no longer own their own movie theaters.\n\nAt the time, you know, there would be like the Paramount Theater in Hollywood from the Paramount Film Production Company, right? They would show their movies, right?\n\nSupreme Court said no more. And all of a sudden, um, exploitation films became a little bit more legit because the haste code kind of fell apart.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd this is post World War II. So, people had seen a lot of death recently.\n\nWell, a lot of death and then grown up a little more.\n\nThey thought ladies, uh, in, uh, suggestive roles were good for morale, and there was a, a little bit of loosening on the sex thing a little bit post World War II enough that led to another subgenre, um, of exploitation film, the nudist colony film, which were, which were pawned off as documentaries. Uh-huh.\n\nA lot. Well, most of these were pawned off as docu-documentaries, which legitimized them. But really, it was maybe, maybe it actually was filmed at a news camp.\n\nProbably not. Mostly they were actors and actresses just engaged in archery naked or, um, long walks naked.\n\nThere could be no sex still. That was still taboo.\n\nNo, but it was just like naked pretty people, right? At a nudist colony, which is interesting because you're not a nudist, so come learn about them.\n\nExactly.\n\nYeah. Uh, after that, through the history, we had things like, um, the teen, like you said, the teen rebellion of the 50s with the Rebel Without a Cause and Blackboard Jungle and movies like that all of a sudden were targeted specifically at teens, which was new. And then drive-in theaters were built so teenagers could see movies where their parents weren't going to be. Apparently, the adults didn't go to drive-ins a lot at first.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nIt's all kids.\n\nI didn't know that. So, they showed exploitation films, and then later the beach films which\n\n\nWere marketed as it's silly. It's Frankie Avalon, but they were decidedly weird and overtly sexual sometimes. And then Chuck, if you, if, if you'll notice, um, we're kind of progressing along in this, um, um, chronological order, and each thing is kind of being built on the last. It was very much a step process, right? And, um, apparently that, that was kind of the, the form that Exploitation Films followed until 1960. It was just, it was centered around drugs, violence, sex, and in a lot of ways they were presented as documentaries. They might not have a plot, right? Um, and it basically, it was one person would make some film, and it would just break all the rules, and then a bunch of other people would make similar films, right? And, and the, the, the same, that, that was the way it went. And then, um, in the 1960s things just started to go every which way, all sorts of directions, right? So, nudity, nudity films were a, a, a longstanding thread of exploitation films, and then they probably reached their pinnacle with Russ Meyer, right? King of the Nudies is what he's called. Yeah. He was the first guy to. He's significant because he was the first director to have films featuring nudity that actually were, uh, dramatic narratives and had plots. Yeah. And characters, and they weren't classified as documentaries anymore. And then the Ruffies came along, and they offered up violence for the, not the first time, but, uh, big time for the first time, right? And, uh, that has a lot to do with the fact that it was the 60s, and Kennedy was shot, and the United States was just becoming increasingly violent. America lost its innocence. Yeah. Um, and the other thing that really happened in the 1960s was the Hays Code officially went away, was replaced by the MPAA, and the, the, I guess the longstanding, um, prohibition on Hollywood producing exploitation films was, it, it was lessened, decreased. And so studios were like, \"Oh, we can make money over here too. Well, let's start making exploitation films.\" Right? And this is where Grindhouse is born. So, my, uh, cinema professor definition, okay, of, of Grindhouse is big budget studio-backed exploitation films. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's, that's mine. I like it. That's going to be a quiz question later. Yeah, I'll go with that. Um, actually, back up one second. We got to mention Herschell Gordon Lewis. He was a director, um, who had a co-director. I can't remember the other guy's name. Do you? Uh-huh. Anyway, he was, he was a co-director, and he was one of these exploitation guys that was getting frustrated because there weren't a lot of places to show your movie. So, it was a pretty crowded marketplace. Yeah. So, he said, \"What's the one taboo that, like, people will pay to see that you, you're allowed to show in theaters, but that, uh, studios won't make?\" And it was Gore. Oh, yeah. He was the first guy to start showing really disgusting bloody scenes in his movie, uh, Blood Feast. Blood Feast. Yeah. Which actually was three years after Psycho. And Psycho also did a lot for the mainstream ushering in of Sure. Little bit of gore in that, but now a shot of blood following Janet Lee's murder. That's right. You know, which I imagine is pretty graphic for Hollywood, right? And that's what you think of. You're like, \"Oh, that's stupid 60s.\" But that's, you know, they were so naive. Like, that was controversial. Not really though. Like, if you step just slightly outside of Hollywood, you ran into things like, uh, Blood Feast, right? Or, you know, Last House on the Left. Yes. Well, that's 1972, I think. Yeah. West Craven. So, that was important because, um, all of a sudden, a drugs started, uh, well, three things. Political, uh, themes started popping up, right? Sexual freedom, the youth generation. Uh, drugs started popping up in movies for the first time. Drug use. Well, not for the first time, because we, we'll talk about Reefer Madness. Yeah. Um, but teenagers were depicted as victims of violence for the first time. Like, Last House on the Left, I believe, is kind of regarded as the first teen slasher film. Yeah, West Craven. It's, it was almost a snuff film. It was almost regarded like that. It's pretty hardcore, but yeah, it definitely, Blood Feast definitely allowed Last House on the Left to come around, but it also probably more directly, um, form the foundation for, um, slasher exploitation like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. Absolutely. Um, My Bloody Valentine's, another big one. The Crazy Your Graves. Uh-huh. Yeah, the Crazy. Oh, yeah. That was an original, right? There's a remake now, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Remakes. Uh, so that brings us. We're in the 70s. Um, politically charged movies, uh, brought race into the, to the mix, and all of a sudden we had, uh, black exploitation or black exploitation, uh, movement starting. Yeah. Exploiting the civil rights movement, basically. Yeah. But the cool thing about, uh, black exploitation films is for the first time you had African-Americans as heroes. Yeah. And not heroes in a typical sense, not even anti-heroes. Yeah. But heroes that were like, they didn't ride into town on, on a white horse or wearing a white hat, right? They very, um, clearly wore black hats if need be. Like, they would engage in crime. They would murder people if need be. They were, um, they, they were basically like the, um, face of black America coming out of the civil rights era. Like, we're ticked off. Yeah. You know, and we're going to stick it to the white man. Stick it to the man. And we're going to do it in these movies. Chuck, I know the movie you're about to, um, to mention. Let's. This is it. You keep the faith in me. Are you my man? You're my favorite man. Can you take it, baby? So, yes, that was, uh, a landmark film for a lot of reasons. One, because it grossed 4 million bucks. Mhm. And it made the major studio say, \"Hey, you know what? The Black Hero is marketable.\" Yeah. Well, you haven't said the title yet. Oh, I didn't? No. Okay. You got to say it right, too. Melvin Van Peebles's film, uh, Sweet, Sweetback's, Badass Song. Nice. That was well done. That was 1971. Melvin Van Peebles, whose last name may sound familiar. He's the father of Mario Van Peebles for you younger cats listening to this one. Um, Cats our age actually. Younger cats because he's kind of like. Okay. So, Cats Our little. Yeah, that's Mario Van Peebles's dad, you know, New Jack City. Yeah, exactly. Um, so Melvin Van Peebles made this movie. He produced it. He, he raised the money for it. He wrote it. He directed it. He starred in it. And it was the beginning of the black exploitation subgenre, which is one of the most important genres of, uh, any American cinema. Absolutely. Ever. Absolutely. And so, considering how important that subgenre is, this quote from Time magazine's film critic Richard Corass, um, should really hit home. Sweet Sweetback, uh, is quote, without question or competition, the most influential movie by a black filmmaker. So, this is a really big deal, right? Yeah. And it was, it was just quickly on the plot. It was about a, uh, a black man who was a gigolo who had, which is a male prostitute for you younger cats. And he had a deal worked out with the cops where he, he said, \"You know, you can arrest me as much as you want. Release me right afterward. Fill your quota. It's all good.\" And then one day while the arrest is going down, they, um, the cops attack a Black Panther, and Sweet Sweetback kills one of the cops, and then just says he just goes on a, a rampage against a white man after that. Yep. So, you've got, um, prostitution, um, tons and tons of nudity and sex, um, lots of violence, um, and, uh, other crimes all wrapped up into a black power theme. That's right. Uh, and then to top it all off, you have what is arguably a child sex scene starring Mario Vamples, Melvin Van Peebles's son, at, I think, age six. Yeah, he's a kid having sex, uh, as Sweet Sweet Pack. It's his first sexual encounter with an older person, right? Um, and in the cult podcast, if he became a cult leader, he would have taken a younger bride, remember? Oh, yeah. That's right. So, uh, if you're interested in, in that movie and you can't get enough of Sweet Sweetback's badass song, um, you could also check out, um, Badass exclamation point, which is Mario Van Peebles's biopic about his father making that movie. That's right. And I have not seen that, but I wanted to at the time, and it just sort of slipped through the cracks. There's always Netflix, baby. That's right. Uh, and, uh, what happened with, um, Sweet Sweetback was that, like I said, that told the studios, \"Hey, we can market this.\" And so they got a little more mainstream with movies like Superfly, which were a little safer. Shaft. Uh, Shaft, um, movies that wide audiences would enjoy as well. Yeah. The ones that didn't scare the man. Exactly. Like, Shaft's a good guy. He doesn't take any guff from the man, but the people he's not taking guff from are the cops who he's really on the same side as. That's right. So, Chuck, um, black exploitation, obviously huge. It, it affected everything from, um, you know, Menace to Society to Blackula. All of that came from Sweet, Sweet Back. And, um, we mentioned the guy who directed this next movie, Russ Meyer. Um, this is probably a seminal work. Let's listen to to this clip from the trailer. Ladies and gentlemen, go for a wild, wild ride with the Watusi Cats. But beware, the sweetest kittens have the sharpest claw. For your own safety, see Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill. Wild women. Wild wheels. Race the fastest pussycats and they'll beat you to death. Superwoman, belted, buckled, and booted. [Music] You're wasting yourself on this kid. I'm hanging up for nothing. For nothing. It's got nothing to do with the money. She has the money. Jack and Jill, they make the mafia look like brownies. Hey, he's a big one, ain't he? They make the mafia look like brownies. That's right. That says quite a bit about them. Um, so this, that was Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill. Um, in the 1965 Russ Meyer, um, basically, uh, women exploitation film, nudie film. So, remember Russ Meyer's King of the Nudies. King of the Nudies. He made 26 movies, but this is probably at the very least is his best known, uh, if not like his masterpiece. Yeah. And he hatched a slew of, uh, I mean, not that he wasn't legit, he was, but what mainstream people would call legit filmmakers were came up through the Russ Meyer film camp, basically. Yeah. So, it's pretty cool. Yeah. Um, and, uh, Russ Meyer also, little known fact, another movie that's mentioned in this article. There's an article on the site, by the way, called 10 Noteworthy Exploitation Films that this is based on. Yeah. Written by you. Yeah. Um, which I strongly recommend going to read because it has a lot of extra stuff we're not going to cover in this one. Yeah. Or at least extra movies. But, um, Russ Meyer directed a movie called Beyond the Valley of the Dolls 2, right? Which was the bastard son of the legitimate film Beyond the Valley of Dolls. It was a jiggle fest written by none other than Roger Ebert. That's right. Yeah. Only movie Roger Ebert ever wrote. Yeah. And he had a, um, Yeah. It was a very brief career, but that's, that's an illustrious one, really. Uh, yeah. So, if you're going to talk about the plot of Faster Pussycat, Kill. Um, and I say that because there's three exclamation points. Faster Pussycat and a comma. Exclamation point. Kill. Oh, no. Is it three exclamation points? Yeah. Okay. I thought it was a comma then two. All right. Either way, that's a lot of punctuation for a film title, right? And, uh, it was about three bisexual go-go dancers. They go on a crime spree out in the desert. And, uh, what do they do? They end up killing a man and a, or no, they kill the man and a couple girl. They basically empower her. Yeah. Say, \"Come on with us.\" By murdering her boyfriend, and she ends up on the crime spree with them. And they basically end up, uh, going to a isolated house with a wheelchair-bound old man and his sons who's a lech. They're all leches. They want these women. Yeah. But they don't know that these women are tough. No. Tough ladies. And the, the, the men and his son, the man and his sons apparently, um, are allegedly have a large amount of cash stashed in this house. So, it's kind of like a, a standoff of, of gaul to see who will come out on top, you know. Well, and you know who comes out on top. Yeah. Uh, and this film was, uh, noteworthy, uh, for one big reason was that, uh, there was a lot of dualism toward gender. So, on one hand, he's exploiting these women, and apparently got women in their first trimester of pregnancy so they were more voluptuous. Yeah. Not in this film, but in his other films, he, he would hire, um, I can't remember the lady's name, but the star of Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill was in other Russ Meyer films. And, um, he made sure that she was like well into her third first trimester to to enhance her, um, natural bustiness. That's right. Yeah. Her bosom, if you will. Uh, but the script, like I said, it was dualism because while he did that, it also empowered women because the women in his films bowed to no man. No, they were the\n\n\nChamps.\nThey were the, they were heroines really for the first time, but they were, they were objectified very clearly, but at the same time, if you follow the script and really look at their characters, then yeah, they're, they're powerful women.\nAnd this uh kind of kicked off a big slew of women exploitation films, sex exploitation films, the women in prison movies.\nYes.\nSwitchblade sisters, very big at the time.\nUh women were lead actors for the first time.\nThey were aggressors for the first time.\nUh still nude often while they were doing this stuff spawned the television show The Facts of Life.\nBut the interesting thing is they found that these movies appealed to men and women because men would go see it for obvious reasons.\nYeah.\nWomen would go see it because it was empowering and uh they didn't mind, you know, looking at the naked ladies because women are much more grown up.\nSure.\nThan men are.\nYeah.\nBut Josh, the 70s also got a little schlocky, which in a sense was true to the exploitation model.\nThey like they really went over the top.\nNo more political statements, no more advancing of uh women's gender or or African-American Americans.\nIt just got really schlocky and outrageous at that point.\nWell, what happened starting in the 60s but really took hold in the 70s and then from that point on was exploitation cinema early on showing a live birth nudist camps.\nThese were all geared toward adults.\nYeah.\nIn the 60s and then later on big time in the 70s the audience became almost exclusively teenagers, right?\nLike those drive-in teenagers or um teenagers anywhere, who cares?\nUm, but they the the audience was teenagers and the cast started to become teenagers.\nSo, it had a little more of a bent on what teenagers were having to deal with like bullying like the the the kid in in this next clip.\nRight.\nWhich is, I have to say, one of my favorite movies from way, way back.\nHere we go with Toxic Avenger.\nYeah.\nMeet little Melvin.\nHe's a 90 lb weakling.\nEveryone hated Melvin.\nI'm going to take this mop and shove it down your throat.\nThey teased him.\nI'm going to do it with you.\nOkay.\nThey taunted him.\nThey tormented him until he had a horrifying accident and fell into a vat of nuclear waste.\nTransforming little Melvin into a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength.\nMelvin became the toxic Avenger.\nSo Josh, the toxic Avenger movie was unique in that its film production company Trauma\nMhm.\nis very popular in their own right.\nHave you ever seen Surf Nazis Must Die?\nI haven't, but I know about Trauma.\nI mean, they are master self-promoters and marketeers.\nThey have, they were one of the um first production companies to have a website.\nOh, really?\nLike a really comprehensive website.\nYou should go on their website.\nTheir whole catalog.\nIt's um really just well done.\nIt's It's schlocky, but it's well done, right?\nAnd Toxic Avenger uh follows the story of a 98 pound weakling uh who was picked on, released the same year as Ghostbusters.\nDo you notice that?\n1984, right?\nYeah.\nSo, it was it occurred at zero year at the year zero.\nYeah.\nUh we'll just put the null set to represent that.\nAnd um this kid gets uh pushed out of a window into a vat of toxic sludge, which that's beyond bullying really.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean that this basically it's a more twisted version of Modern Problems, the Chevy Chase film from a couple years earlier.\nOkay.\nI haven't seen that one.\nOh, you never saw Modern Problems?\nNo.\nIt's very silly.\nBut he got toxic sludge dumped on him and had special powers from years earlier or prior or after?\nWhat when was the movie?\nYeah, it was two years before Toxic Avenger.\nBut Toxic Avenger took it into a gore special effects uh way that that Modern Problems never did.\nSo, the the uh janitor Melvin, I believe his name is, um becomes toxified.\nHe becomes Toxy, the toxic avenger.\nYeah.\nWho um beats the tar out of people at the health club where he was abused and and mutated.\nUm and uh has tons of sex as the Toxic Avenger because his um newfound manhood is just irresistible to women.\nAnd um one one of the things that's noteworthy about the Toxic Avenger is that they actually tried to make decent effects.\nYeah.\nIt wasn't just it wasn't horrible, I guess you could say.\nWell, for the time, you know, it wasn't bad.\nNo, they they remain bad and they probably were kind of bad even back then, but for for grindhouse films, yeah, there you go.\nThey were they were great, right?\nUm and uh it was also noteworthy because it came out of Troma Productions or Troma Studios.\nUm, and it led to a whole line of toxic Avenger movies and schlock in general, which is basically like some crazy horrible thing has happened.\nBut we're not going to dwell too much on that.\nLet's see what Let's Let's see where the action takes us.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nSo like um Bad Taste, the Peter Jack Peter Jackson's first film is a great example of schlock that came out of Toxic Avenger.\nAnd he had the uh film that followed Peter Jackson Dead Alive, which was at one point supposedly the goriest film ever made.\nReally.\nAlthough it sounds like your new Korean movie has surpassed that.\nYeah, I I think it probably has.\nI haven't seen Dead Alive.\nI've seen Bad Taste and Bad Taste was horribly gory, but I think this has a beat.\nYeah, but I bet you if anything I mean I haven't seen the one you're talking about, but is it more realistic gore?\nYeah, with bad like these are aliens that are having their heads blown off, so that definitely takes you at least a um a a degree away from caring.\nThis is happening to human beings in in um I saw the devil.\nSo, it definitely is driven home a little more.\nWell, and and the violence, even the gore back then, it was so over the top.\nRight out of Fangora magazine, it's like, you know, dude, Fangoria is still around.\nIs it?\nYeah.\nI figured it was.\nI I I'm glad it is.\nWe follow it on our Twitter feed.\nOh, we do?\nYep.\nYeah.\nLike a head will explode in scanners and, you know, it's not disturbing because it's so clearly over the top, but these new movies are much more disturbing if you ask me.\nI agree wholeheartedly because they're more realistic.\nYeah.\nUm, so carrying on with Chucks and My Cisco and Eber act.\nUh, this is uh the second to last movie in our little list today.\nAnd um, this one's from way back from the 30s.\nSo, let's talk about Reefer Madness.\nThese high school boys and girls are having a hop at the local soda fountain.\nInnocently they dance, innocent of a new and deadly menace lurking behind closed doors.\nMarijuana, the burning weed with its roots in hell or watch case.\nIf you want a good smoke, try one of these.\nYou will meet Bill, who once took pride in his strong will as he takes the first step toward enslavement.\n[Music]\nOf course, it feels safe.\n[Music]\nSo that was the excellent Reefer Madness which was an exploitation drug exploitation film.\nYeah.\nAnd very much a cautionary tale.\nIt it even shaped the drug culture and how uh people looked at drugs is is you know marijuana at the time as this really evil thing that can make you crazy and kill people.\nYeah.\nAnd actually in in very much the uh vein of early exploitation films, it was produced and distributed um as a uh a public service like the the alternate title for it was um tell your children and the whole thing set in a PTA meeting where this guy is relating this story and it's a story about lost lives about murder about um guilt and paranoia and all of it is fed and based on rampant drug use, which is really just a lot of pot smoking, um, which can turn you into a fiend.\nAnd, um, it it's apparently the director, uh, his name is Dwayne Esper.\nHe did, uh, other exploitation films from the 30s like Sex Madness, Psychotic Connections.\nUm and he made a name for himself.\nBasically taking these things that may have originally been written as a public service, right?\nAnd making them so outlandish that he exploited the people who were making these movies, right?\nAnd and created this legacy of like just insanely over-the-top exploitation films from the 30s.\nWell, and ironically, Reefer Madness uh years later would become um not so much an anti-drug propaganda film.\nHow should I say this?\nBut a film that college students would sit around and watch while partaking and laughing at this whole thing.\nYeah.\nAn a cult film.\nYeah.\nBecause it it it puts drugs so far out there that um if you despite all the warnings take drugs anyway and you realize that you don't turn into a fiend and murder somebody, um you uh re Reefer Madness basically dares you to go further.\nSo it's kind of an it's the opposite.\nIt has the opposite effect of what I think its original intent was before Dwayne Esper got his hands on it.\nAnd as a side note, I had trouble deciding between Reefer Madness and another 1930s film by a guy named Todd Browning called Freaks.\nOh yeah.\nWell, that was um that was huge because it was the first big exploitation film pre Haze Code or and last.\nYeah.\nFirst and last.\nAnd it was it was an MGM film.\nYeah.\nAnd it's widely considered a masterpiece.\nYeah.\nI mean, it looks great.\nIt's It's not It was well done.\nIt's a huge um It's a It's a revenge movie, which is a very common theme in um exploitation films.\nYeah.\nEspecially violent ones.\nBut it's it it featured Browning dared to um have real freaks, I guess, if you'll\nYeah.\nCircus sideshow freaks is what it was about.\nUm star in this.\nUh and they basically exact their revenge on people who've mistreated them.\nYeah.\nAnd uh I have not seen it.\nOh, really?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI I I want to.\nI hear it's just awesome.\nI can't wait.\nIt ended his career though, unfortunately.\nDid it really?\nYeah.\nAnd he was a a popular filmmaker at the time.\nWell, hats off to him for for staying true to his art.\nChuck just took his hat off on the old cabin.\nAll right, Chuck.\nHere's the last one that we've got a clip for um which I think everybody will notice um or recognize without even a word.\nThere's not even a word in this clip and you will understand what's going on.\nSo, uh here we go.\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nSo Josh, those are the unmistakable sounds of Fist The Fury of Mr. uh when Mr. Bruce Lee\nBruce Lee Kicking Bottom his first movie.\nYeah.\nUm which uh was originally titled Well, it's still titled I think in Asia the Big Boss.\nUm and uh in America it is.\nIt's it's titled Fist of Fury.\nYeah.\nIt was on the other night on cable.\nI saw part of it.\nOh yeah.\nYeah.\nI didn't realize it was his first one though.\nI would have tuned in.\nYeah.\nAnd it was first of what um five five major films, right?\nUh, and basically it's the story of a martial arts student who's investigating the murder of his teacher.\nAnd um, it began uh, the martial arts exploitation subgenre, which later would become just martial arts films, right?\nOr was it still considered exploitation?\nIt's all the same.\nOkay.\nThey're one and the same.\nAnything that even remotely resembles a Bruce Lee movie, specifically The Big Boss or any of them, is martial arts exploitation technically.\nUm because again we arrive at that one definition, it's over the top.\nLike Bruce Lee's taking on scores of anonymous thugs um for two hours, one after the other for two hours, just beating the tar out of all these people without tiring really.\nUm everybody's kind of waiting their turn politely in a circle around him and he has to beat everybody, right?\nAnd then he works his way up and it's over the top.\nSo it is exploitation, but um it led to other films like Samurai Exploitation.\nRemember American Ninja.\nRemember the whole ninja film thing that that came out in the mid 80s?\nThat's from Bruce Lee's um that's Bruce Lee's doing.\nWell, yeah.\nAnd you go to these at the time when I was first going to New York many years ago, there would be uh you know, you go to Time Square and this was still when Times Square was kind of gross.\nAnd there would be just the the martial arts movie store where it was all that stuff, man.\nLike thousands of movies about ninjas and samuris and martial artists and uh very big.\nYeah.\nI was inspired by American Ninja to become a ninja.\nRemember I entered a ninja training with Tommy Roer who had like more throwing stars than any kid I've ever known.\nWhat did you have like one throwing star?\nI borrowed his.\nOkay.\nI was not allowed to have throwing stars of my own.\nOh, I wasn't either.\nYeah.\nBaptist.\nNo.\nNo.\nThat was very violent.\nNo nunchucks.\nI think that even that transcends like religious background.\nIt's like if you're a good parent, you shouldn't let your kid have throwing star.\nIt's a good point.\nUh, and as you pointed out in the article, this actually led to another subgenre, which was Bruce Lee lookalike movies.\nYeah.\nSo, he made five movies and then died at age 32.\nYeah.\nIn 1973.\nSo, Big Boss released in 1971.\nHe dies two years later.\nEverybody's like, &quot;No.&quot;\nSo, let's find some guys that look like him.\nWhich is really kind of stereotypical and racist for the West, but name him Bruce Lee.\nL I instead of L E or L E or just L E there.\nWell, Bruce Li or Bruce Le um uh I don't think there was ever like uh Bruce Li Gh.\nI don't think it ever got that far, but I mean they released dozens of Bruce Lee and I just made air quote films there.\nSo Bruce Lee created the martial arts exploitation genre and subgenre and he inadvertently created the Bruce Lee exploitation subgenre of the martial arts exploitation subgenre by dying young.\nYeah.\nAnd being very popular.\nYeah.\nAnd\n\n\nUh, which one was the one he had Kareem Jabar in? Was that Enter the Dragon?\nEnter the Dragon.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIf you've never seen a like seven-foot-plus guy do martial arts, you should check that out.\nAnd uh, if you can't get enough Bruce Lee and you have a uh, a good sense of humor, check out Kentucky Fried Movie.\nYeah.\nMade by one Jerry Zucker, who we met in in Los Angeles recently.\nUm, and who used an expletive, de was one of the high points of my life.\nIt is.\nUm, but yeah, Kentucky Fried Movie.\nAwesome.\nActually, when we met Jerry Zucker, we told him that our little speech we were given that night was one of the highlights of our career thus far.\nAnd he says, \"Well, that doesn't say much about your career, does it?\" like the first thing the dude does say something funny, and we just like kind of fawned over him after that.\nUh, we should mention briefly, and it's in the article, but uh, just as a teaser, uh, the late '70s, we got Nazi exploitation movies.\nNazi exploitation as a subgenre.\nYeah.\nAnd one of the major players there moviewise was Elsa Shewolf of the SS.\nYeah.\nWhich led to Elsa, um, Siberian Tigris, and Elsa Harm Keeper of the Oil Chic.\nReally?\nThere's a whole sex violence franchise, dominatrix franchise that was based out of the Nazi exploitation film.\nYou know, one could argue that QT, Mr. Tarantino, has made nothing but exploitation films since Pulp Fiction, because the Kill Bills were definitely martial arts exploitation.\nDefinitely.\nThe uh, Jackie Brown was a riff on uh, on black exploitation.\nUh, Death Proof, obviously that was what they were trying to do there.\nDeath Proof is car exploitation, which follows in the tradition of Vanishing Point, right?\nUm, which was released the same year as basically its rival to the um, the founder, the founding movie of Carloitation, Twolane Blacktop, right?\nGreat movie.\nYeah, if you want to start an argument with an exploitation film buff, tell them Vanishing Point was the beginning of Carloitation.\nThey'll get mad at you.\nAnd then finally, Tarantino with the uh, Inglorious Basterds, which was clearly a riff on the Nazi exploitation films.\nYeah.\nBeating Nazis to death with a baseball bat.\nThat's about as over the top and lured as it gets.\nIt's awesome.\nYeah.\nUm, so, uh, and then Machete, I hated it, but Robert Rodriguez, um, it was terrible.\nAnd of course, he was the other half of the uh, Rodriguez was the other half with his Planet Terror of the Grindhouse double feature.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nAnd Machete was born from one of the little fake trailers they made in that movie.\nOh, is that right?\nYeah.\nIt was one of the the fake uh, movie previews.\nIt is even as far as like a purposefully be movie.\nNot good.\nNo.\nWell, Death Proof was okay, but I didn't like Planetar that much.\nYeah.\nUm, and then Chuck.\nWell, first of all, before we get to today, we also have to give a shout out to Pornos.\nPorno came out of the exploitation film genre.\nAnd it arguably had a lot to do with killing um, the ex or pushing it into the mainstream because once you had the movie [Â __Â ] and all of a sudden pornography was on the screen, it's like you can't do an exploitation film about it anymore if there's the real deal going on, it it loses all its power, right?\nAnd then a little movie called Jaws came along, and all of a sudden a quote unquote bem movie style movie made gobs and gobs of money, and that put a little bit of uh, mainstream respectability on the map all of a sudden.\nAnd so one might argue Josh that uh, movies like Jaws and pornography kind of shoved exploitation films, even though they still exist, they're sort of mainstream movies now.\nYeah.\nWell, yeah.\nI guess another word for grindhouse these days is blockbuster.\nJaws was the first blockbuster movie, summer blockbuster.\nAnd now you have to have summer blockbusters, and they're always over the top, right?\nAnd exploitive of viewers tastes, and not only Tarantino, there's other filmmakers out that are trying to capture that '70s vibe with overt exploitation films.\nAgain, shot that way, shot on uh, uh, 35 or I'm sorry, uh, 16-millimeter film, stuff like that.\nYeah.\nSo, um, Chuck, I say our message to everybody is number one, go on to the site, read, uh, 10 noteworthy exploitation films.\nUm, number two, if that interests you, like even the 10 noteworthy exploitation films I chose, um, don't cover even I think a third of the exploitation subgenres.\nSo, there'll probably be another article forthcoming at some point.\nIf there is, we'll let you know.\nAnd then go watch some exploitation movies and enjoy them.\nYeah, watch uh, the documentary American Grindhouse, too, if you're into that.\nYeah, it's a great one.\nIt's free on Hulu, actually.\nUm, there's ads, but hulu.com has American Grindhouse for free.\nIt is not safe for work.\nNo.\nIn no way, shape, or form.\nI was watching it at work, and I was like, whoa.\nOkay.\nOh, really?\nYeah.\nIf you are watching it at work, tabbed browsing is what you want to be doing, right?\nAnd keep your your finger over the mouse and uh, keep the cursor over the other tab, right, and stay sharp.\nOr in our case, you can just say it's research, but you can't do that if you if you're an accountant at uh, JP Morgan.\nYou're just a sicko, a weirdo.\nThat's right.\nThat weird guy in accounting.\nUm, so look up 10 noteworthy exploitation films.\nYou can type that into the handy search bar at howstuffworks.com.\nAnd now at long last, it's time for listener mail.\nJoshers, I'm going to call this uh, it's a small world after all.\nUh, dear guys, I'm a longtime fan from Minnesota and enjoy spreading stuff you should know goodness wherever I go.\nMy co-workers at a local coffee shop know me for the trivia and information I abound in.\nUh, but after giving Wait, what?\nThat he he says he abounds in.\nI guess he's proficient in.\nOkay.\nDid he misuse that?\nNo, I don't know.\nIt sounds hilarious.\nIt does.\nUm, after giving credit where credit is due, which means us, uh, several of them decided to subscribe to your podcast.\nUh, listening to the podcast has also given me an advantage at work for thinking of the coffee shop's daily trivia question, which saves people 10 cents on their drink if they know it.\nThat is awesome.\nUh, after relisting to how Legos work, I set the trivia question for which company produces the most tires on a yearly basis?\nA Bridgestone, B. Goodyear, C. Lego Bricks.\nYou know the answer, Josh?\nMost people were surprised and pleased to find out it was Lego Bricks, uh, reminding them about the little playsets that their kids enjoy.\nUh, this is where it gets weird.\nOne of the customers read the trivia question, looked at me, and said, \"It's a puny scheme.\"\nNice.\nThat's awesome.\nIn the best Italian accent he could muster, everyone else gave him an odd look.\nI started laughing.\nHe apologized and then say and said he just heard it on a podcast.\nUm, he had just listened to Legos followed by Ponzi schemes.\nLong story short, we were both pleased to find out that we were both fans.\nUh, we are now on a first-name basis, eager to discuss the most recent episodes.\nSo, these dudes in Minneapolis, Daniel.\nThat's awesome.\nThanks, Daniel.\nAnd his friend, now his new friend, his unnamed friend.\nYeah, he didn't name him.\nYou wouldn't know him.\nHe met him at camp.\nThat's right.\nBand Camp.\nThanks, Daniel.\nThat's really awesome.\nUm, wow, that's really cool.\nLet let us know if you tweet um, those daily facts for your uh, coffee house because we will start following you.\nIndeed, that'd be very cool.\nUm, if you want to follow us, we have our own Twitter feed.\nSeriously, it's called Sysk Podcast.\nOne word, 10,000 strong plus.\nYeah.\nUm, we're on uh, No, we're up to like 11 and change.\nWell, that's plus 10.\nThat's true.\nUm, we're also on Facebook.\nFacebook.com/ stuff you should know.\nYep.\nWe have a KA team, right?\nWe're trying to get to half a million dollars.\nThat's right.\nUh, that's kivva.org/team/ stuff you should know.\nUh, and then you can always send us a good old-fashioned email.\nUm, we want to know what your favorite um, exploitation film of all time is.\nUh, you can send that in an email to stuffpodcast@ousstuffworks.com.\n[Music]\nFor more on this and thousands of other topics, visit housestuffworks.com.\nTo learn more about the podcast, click on the podcast icon in the upper right corner of our homepage.\nThe House Stuff Works iPhone app has arrived.\nDownload it today on iTunes.\n",
