  "cleanText": "Hi everybody. Back to the Stuff You Should Know Summer Movie Playlist. And this one is from January 2013. It's our how stuntmen and women work episode. I think your socks are going to be knocked off by how hard these people work for our movie viewing enjoyment. You enjoy, too.\n\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know from howstuffuffs.com.\n\nHey and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. And this is Stuff You Should Know. Well, Jerry had an itchy trigger finger today. Did you hear in there? Yeah. She's ready to go home. Yeah. She was like, \"Come on. 3 2 1 go. You guys aren't my entire life.\" I know. We like to think we are, but that is we're like .1% of Jerry's life. Yeah. She's giggling in there. She's quite the adventurer.\n\nUh, how you doing, man? I'm great, man. I'm ready to jump from a tall building or roll a brand new car, man. Sorry.\n\nThat's what I was going to ask you. So, I guess you did the intro for us. Go ahead. Let's pretend like that didn't happen. No, it's fine. Okay. Uh, you were just doing what? The theme from The Fall Guy starring Lee Major, 1980s awesome TV show with probably the best truck ever featured in a TV show. The That GMC, man. That thing is sweet.\n\nYeah. Yeah. You know, dudes recreate that truck. If you if you Google it, there's a lot of guys that have like made that truck for themselves for good reason, too. It's a cool truck. Yeah. And it's interesting that The Fall Guy points out a couple of the show itself points out a very important things as far as stuntmen go. One is that he had to moonlight as a bounty hunter. Mhm. And that's kind of one of the things we'll learn is that there's not a lot of work out there and to go around, you know, like it's tough to make it as a stunt man. Yeah. you get punched. Yeah. And uh B, he's if you look at the lyrics to that theme song, man, he is really salty about not getting the glory and the girls. Yeah. Mainly the girls and the glory. He he uh but when he winds up in the hey, it's only hey.\n\nUh so the song complains about not getting glory or women. And that is one of the hallmarks though of the stunt person is to remain anonymous and to be bitter about it, I guess. Oh, very few stunt people you've ever heard of. Well, yeah. There the uh the Academy of Arts and Sciences. They give out the Academy Awards, the Oscars. Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Yeah. Um they don't have a category for stunt people. Nope. Never have. And the reason some people give is because they like to maintain the anonymity and the illusion. Sure. That's provided by stunt people filling in as doubles for stars. Yeah. But you can win a what was the award? You can win an Emmy for best stunt coordinator. True. Or the stunt award. They have their own stunt awards. Oh, yeah. The tourist world stunt awards. Yeah, you can win a Tory. They took a uh they took a hiatus. I saw that there was uh 2010 and they're having stuff for 2012. Couldn't find anything about 2011. Really? Yeah. So, if you know what happened to the Tourist World Stunt Awards for 2011, we are curious. Interesting. Let us know.\n\nSo, thanks for listening. Uh, so anyway, oh, uh, well, let's talk about the history of stunt people. Um, they pretty much have only been around as long as you've had motion pictures, right? Yeah. Uh, there there wasn't much of a need for them before then. No. I mean, maybe for like a show or something like that, like a Wild Bill Hickok show. Oh, I guess I see your point. We call them stunt men, but but really you you kind of want to differentiate because you can also say, \"All right, so people who ride horses on standing up on a horse's back, that's a stunt person.\" Yeah. Right. Um a a guy who like is in the X Games, those extreme sports kids. Sure. That all the kids are into these days. That's a stunt. These are by, you know, technically stunt people. What we're talking about are movie stunt people.\n\nSure. And the whole point to their their craft isn't to like, you know, do a 580 on a bike unless somebody asks them to. What they want to do is create what you would just take for granted like, \"Oh, that guy just got clocked, right?\" No, he didn't actually get clocked. That was a stunt man who knows what he's doing, and that was a carefully choreographed scene that just flew right past you. Uh, but it still your brain still just absorbed it as that man just got punched, even though that didn't really happen. That's right. And uh we will probably slip into the word stunt man here and there instead of stunt people. Of course there were tons and tons of stunt women. Um but we'll say stunt persons are stunt man. And like luckily there are women now in the back in the day they would dress men as women to do stunts many times. Yeah. Um there was a lot of crossdressing back in the day. There was until they decided hey women are people too and they can act and do stunts right just like guys can. We could put them in danger just as much as well. Exactly.\n\nSo, um, so there wasn't much call for stunt people for movies before movies, just by definition. Sure, don't be ridiculous. But right out of the gate when we started making movies, we started needing people to do stunts. And the earliest people who were doing stunts were actually comedians, slapstick comedians. Like Buster Katon had a very famous early stunt, Steamboat Bill Jr., is that what it was in? Yeah, the very famous. You've probably seen it in uh like you know Hollywood uh Legends of Screen clips and things like that on AMC. Yeah. Uh it is the famous shot where the front facade of a house falls down and uh on well would have been on Buster Katon but he uh is saved because the attic window uh or attic door was open. So it just falls all around him. And there was some careful measuring in place because if he would have been off by a few inches he would have been dead. Yeah. And um that was a real thing. Like the earliest stunts were nothing but the real thing. Like um apparently if you had uh I don't know somebody hanging from like the construction the skeleton of a steel skyscraper. Yeah. You needed that shot. That's what the guy did. Yeah. And they and Ed the Grabster wrote this one, of course. And Ed points out that back in the day before they were were like, you know, before they called them stuntmen, they were just like, \"Let me go find someone crazy enough to go do this.\" Exactly. And that guy uh that that guy at craft service looks crazy enough to do it. And let's go see if he wants an extra 20 bucks. Yeah. And he does. Yeah. Because back, you know, in 1902, 20 bucks was a lot. Sure. Um so as the the film industry grew and grew early in the 20th century, um we went from just nothing but slapstick comedies to things like westerns and action flicks. And all of a sudden, those people who really can ride on the back of a horse standing up became stunt people as well. Um, and as as stunts became more and more complex, the idea of having somebody whose job and specialty was to just do the stunt and make it look like the actor, the star, sure, was doing it started to really develop. Yeah. And then uh flash forward even more, the 60s and 70s is when things really came to their own as far as stunt technology, developing things like uh squibs, which we will talk about for gunshots and uh uh air rams. Is that what they're called? Yeah, it's like a like a pneumatic lift. Yeah, it's pneumatic. Just shoot you up into the air like with a um human cannonball, right? But like so if somebody um if a grenade blows up by somebody and you see the dude fly through the air and he was on a ram. That's right. Um and then other things like airbags and uh and you know more technology with cars with the roll cages like it just got more and more complex. Right. And now of course we have CGI which replaces a lot of stunts in many cases sadly. Not necessarily to um a better effect. Like all I have to say is Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Yeah. Where it was like they suddenly cut to drawings of Harrison Ford swinging on a lasso. He's famous for doing his own stunts though. He didn't do him in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Well, that's cuz he's 89 years old and he would die. He was awesome in Bruno. I didn't see that. Was he Harrison Ford was in it? Yeah. For for about two seconds. Did they do like gay jokes to him or something? They didn't even get that far. Oh, okay. Yeah. Did he just shut it down? Yeah. It was hilarious. Uh, but anyway, so, um, stunts like the the I guess throughout this progression of the field of stunt people, um, safety's gotten better and better is what I think we were just trying to say. To the point now where they're not even used. It's CGI. Yeah. Um, but there's there's always going to be room for stunt people. Oh, yeah. Uh, and the fact that it's gotten safer is is much better, but there's still there's an element of risk to it. No matter what, as Grabster points out, if a stunt didn't present some sort of risk, there'd be no need for stunt people at all. The actors would do it. Yeah. But the actors can't always do it. That's right. Uh, and when you want to call in a stunt person is when they either have a specific skill that they're really good at like um fake martial arts or I mean real martial arts but fake hitting and kicking or um fake martial like chu Kuang like stuff you just made up. It's a lot of like just front kicks in the air. That's what you practice. That's um sword fighting, stage combat like we've talked about stuff like that. Uh they are trained to fall. they are trained to, you know, safely fall. Uh, I guess I should point out and it just basically it's a safety factor on one hand and it's a financial factor on the other because you can't have your main actor, actress going down with a broken leg. Yeah. For four weeks. So, you put your stunt person in there and keep your actor all nice and safe in their trailer. Yeah. Or you want to be shooting uh two things at once. So you have your second unit out there shooting the the fast cars whizzing by in the car chase. Then you have your first unit shooting the actor inside the car driving a lot slower and acting like it's really fast. But shouting and like moving the steering wheel back and forth a lot. Yeah. And maybe there's somebody rocking the car. What's that called? Uh poor men's process. Yeah. Is uh Yeah. So when you I guess we should say this. So, when you're in a car, you either have a a camera rig on your car where it's the real car with cameras attached to it. We've done that. Or the car is on a process trailer, which means a lot of these shots you see with someone driving and you're like, they're not even paying attention to the road. Yeah. It's cuz the car is sitting on a trailer being pulled by a truck, right? Or it's got a little rock to it. Little rock to it. Or you do the poor man's process was when the car is not going anywhere and you have PA's pushing on the outside, pushing on the outside. Little tricks with lighting to make it look like uh headlights going by. We've done that. It's really neat in the end to look at a scene that's poor man's process and think, \"Wow, they're really not even moving and it looks so good.\" Yeah. Yeah. See if you can pick it out in the Stuff You Should Know TV series. They can probably pick it out.\n\nSo, um, yeah, it's financial. It makes sense. Also, uh, one of the other reasons people use stunt people is they come with a set of skills that the average actor doesn't have. A particular set of skills. Exactly. That makes them very dangerous to you. Uh, and so it's you can either hire a stunt man who looks like your star to carry out like a combat scene or sort of look like your star or you can teach your star, you know, spend all this extra money and time training the star this skill in a crash course. So it just most of the time it makes sense to just hire a stunt person. Yeah. And you know, chances are these days you're going to get a mix in a big action movie, you're going to get a mix of all three. You're going to get some CGI. Yeah. You're going to get some stunt people. And these days, you're going to get real actors doing some of the real fake fighting. Doesn't Tom Cruz do a lot of his own stunts? Yeah, I got a list of actors who prefer to do their own stunts. I didn't mean to jump the gun. No, Cru the Cruz is famous for that. I was reading this and I was like, I wonder if I would do my own stunts. I would do some I I would say, sure, I want to learn how to sword fight. Teach me. Like, that's something I want to know. And I'm certainly not going to shell out for it myself ever. So, let's go ahead and and learn. Now, it's a good point. I would do my own stunts. It depends. The heights, no way I would do that. I would jump off of something. Uh, so California state law and of course there's shoot movies all over the place now. Um, and the union rules in Hollywood have really made it uh pretty safe these days, but you're still going to find injuries and your occasional death on set, which is really awful.\n\n\nYeah. Well, there always have been\npretty much from the beginning deaths\nand injuries.\n Howard Hughes.\n Yeah. The\nmovie Hell's Angels, which we must have\ntalked about in the Hell's Angels\npodcast.\nI'm sure we did because I think we\ntalked about the origin of the name\nwhich was from the air combat.\n It was\nthat Yeah, that's what they think.\n The\nFighting Hellcat.\n Yeah, I think that was\none of the theories. Um but uh there\nwere three maybe four fatalities.\n Yeah.\nBecause they were doing like real dog\nfights with airplanes and there were a\nlot of crashes.\n Yeah.\n So that was a\nmovie where people died.\n Yes. Uh very\nfamously, The Twilight Zone, uh the\nmovie, um Jennifer Jason Lee's father,\nVic Maro, and two little Vietnamese kids\ndied uh when a helicopter crashed into\nthe water, man.\n Where they were crossing\na river. Um that's on YouTube, by the\nway.\n I know. It's pretty awful.\n It is.\nAnd I saw it recently because I was just\ncurious.\nI'd always wondered how it went down in\nmy head because I've heard the story\nsince the movie came out, since I was a\nkid. And I was wondering like exactly\nwhat was the logistics and how did that\ngo down.\n It's pretty bad to watch. It is\nbecause it just goes totally out of\ncontrol.\n It does. So I would not\nrecommend that. Um\n but you do have to\nenter your age by the way to watch that\nvideo.\n I saw\n Yeah. Um and on set uh the\nAD is ultimately responsible the\nassistant director for everyone's\nsafety. Uh and in fact on our own little\nTV show when we had fake guns on set\njust as props. Yeah,\n like we didn't even\nuse them in the scene, but just to have\na fake gun on set, the AD has to\nannounce to the whole crew and show them\nthe gun, say, &quot;It's fake. It's not real.\nLook at the barrel. There's no bullets.\nThere's no nothing. It will not be\nfired. We will not be shooting blanks um\nor dummy cartridges.&quot; And it's just, you\nknow, even on a stupid little silly show\nlike ours, you got to be really careful\nwith that stuff.\n Yeah. So, Chuck, uh,\nbecause of this incredibly high-risk\num, profession work, the stuntpeople\nmust be paid out the yin-yang.\nTrue or false?\n Well, they make a good\nrate, but like we said earlier, there's\nnot a ton of work for the amount of\nstuntpeople trying to get work. Oh,\nokay. Uh, and that was when I used to\nwork out in LA as a PA. I would always\ntry and talk to the stuntpeople when I\nworked on jobs where they had stunt\npeople because they're just really\ninteresting.\n Yeah.\n And um, to say the\nleast. And they would usually bemoan\nthe fact that there's not a ton of work\nand, you know, they're all kind of\nscrapping for the same piece of cheese,\nbut that's like everyone in the film\nbusiness.\n Sure.\n From crew to the lead\nactor, you're all you're all after that\nsame piece of cheese.\n Yep. Um, and we've\nworked with some stuntpeople, too.\nYeah, you'd be surprised when you need\nto call in a stunt person. I worked on\nthis one commercial where the was just\nlike bad traffic on the highway that the\nthe shot was and cars had to just sort\nof pull over to the side while another\ncar came through. All the cars that\npulled over to the side of the road had\nto have stunt drivers.\n Wow.\n Yeah. I was\nlike, I I could do that.\nBut then I'd be taking bread off the\ntable of a stunt person,\n right? And the\nwhole production would shut down.\n That's\ntrue. Um, okay. So, the most stunt\npeople, you say, because there's just so\nlittle work for so many people, it's not\na highpaying job. A lot of people do it\nfor the love of it, right?\n Yeah. I mean,\nyou can make money if you're experienced\nand get tons of work, obviously, but\nRight.\n I'd say those are the the few and\nfar between,\n but you'd have to love it\nbecause the hours are usually very very\nlong. Yeah. um to do a stunt is not you\ndon't just walk up and get in the car\nand drive it and all of a sudden it\nflips and there's an explosion and\nyou're hoping for the best,\n right?\n Like\nwhen you see a stunt these things are\nrehearsed over and over again, say for a\ncar chase, they'll go through the entire\ncar chase, but they'll do it at a low\nspeed,\n right?\n Um so that it's\nchoreographed, rehearsed, and everybody\nknows what's going to happen when.\n Yeah.\nUm that takes a very long time. Uh if\nyou need to flip a car, you need to do\nmeasurements. The pyrochnics guys are\nprobably involved. Yeah, there's a lot\nof standing around. There's a lot of\npracticing, there's a lot of measuring,\nthere's a lot of talking. And then if\nfor say you're doing something like in\nin water,\n you're probably standing in\nwater the whole time. So you're doing\nthat for 14 hours. Yeah. It sounds like\nsome You would have to love your work to\ndo this.\n Yeah. It's definitely not a\nglory job, especially factoring in the\nanonymity factor,\n right? When you do all\nthis and you do it absolutely perfectly,\nno one notices.\n That's the goal.\n Yeah.\nIn fact, one of my biggest pet peeves is\nwhen you do notice and you see that one\nshot of the dude with a wig on that's\nsupposed to be Clint Eastwood,\n right?\nYeah. Just disappointing.\n So, um you\nwere saying the second unit director\nhandles this. Um the second unit\ndirector is in charge of shooting\nstunts, but the person who's in charge\nin like of the stunts themselves is the\nstunt coordinator. Yeah.\n And that person\nhires the stuntpeople, plans the\nstunts, oversees the stunts execution,\ndoes everything but actually sets up the\ncamera and all that or handles the\ncamera shooting it. Right.\n Yeah. It's\nbasically its own like a film crew is\nbroken up into many departments and\nthat's just sort of its own little\ndepartment headed by the coordinator.\nGotcha.\n Like they'll have a budget to\nwork with and all that kind of stuff\njust like any other department.\n So let's\ntalk about how they do some stunts.\nOkay. And actually the second unit uh\ndirector a lot of times is a former\nstunt person or stunt coordinator,\nright?\n Uh that makes sense.\n Comes in\nhandy.\n Sure.\n Um let's talk about stunts\nwithout fire.\n How about punches?\nHow about them? Stage fighting man.\nSomething we have not learned yet.\nThat's pretty much a uh a must if you\nwant to become a stunt man. That's\nlesson one is go take stage fighting\ncourses.\n Yep. learn how to sell a punch\nas the giver and as the receiver\n without\nlooking corny and hokey and fake like\npro wrestling,\n right? But it's very much\nsimilar to pro wrestling, especially if\nyou've ever seen somebody throw a punch\nin pro wrestling and you can hear the\nskin slap.\n Yeah.\n That's because that\nperson was actually just punched.\n Yeah.\nThe key is they weren't punched very\nhard. Certainly not as hard as their the\njerk of their head would would say.\nYeah. Suggest. You got camera angles and\nyou've got sound effects and through the\nart of movie magic, it looks like a good\nknockdown dragout brawl,\n right? And if\nyou've got like a really good stunt\ncoordinator, there'll be like a punch\nthat's sold and the person who's being\npunched is on a ram, so they fly through\nthe air afterward.\n Yeah, that's awesome.\nAll right, gunshots. Uh, we talked about\nsquibs. Uh, a squib is basically you're\ngoing to have a a chest metal chest\nplate with a squib on the front of it,\nright,\n to protect your your body. And\nit's a it's it's basically a little\nblood packet that's rigged\nelectronically\n to explode when it's\nsupposed to.\n Uh, and so the plate in\nbetween the squib and your chest\nprotects you.\n Sure.\n Um, and maybe you\nare in charge of you, the stunt man, are\nin charge. You have a little button.\nYeah. maybe\n to to explode the charge or\nthere's somebody else doing it remotely.\nUm and it it's pretty awesome. Releases\ntheater blood opens a hole in the shirt.\nYeah.\n Pretty awesome.\n It is very\nawesome.\n This I didn't realize though um\nhow they make bullet holes in like a\nlike a wall like a stucco wall.\n Yeah.\n I\nI thought this was pretty ingenious.\nThey drill the hole ahead of time.\n Um\nand then they cover it up with like\nputty or paper or something and and\npaint. with a squib in there. Yeah.\n And\nthey blow that squib out\n and it makes a\nbullet hole.\n It's pretty cool.\n It's\ningenious. It's simple, it seems like,\nbut it's very ingenious.\n Well,\nespecially when you watch a movie,\nideally you're getting lost in the\nmovie, not paying attention. But if you\nwatch like a John Woo film or something\nYeah.\n and you see just like a wall get\nriddled with bullets. Just think about\nall the time.\n Yeah.\n Took it took to set\nup all those squibs\n and like what if the\nactor trips in the middle of it? You're\njust like, uh, we have to do it again.\nYeah. Which is no good. And in fact, big\nstunts, uh, they go with many, many\ncameras on stunts that you don't or\ncan't recreate because of either danger\nor money.\n Yeah.\n And like some of these\nshots have like,\n you know, a dozen or\nmore cameras shooting time,\n which makes\na lot of sense,\n of course.\n And Grabster\npoints out that another reason why you\ndon't want to do a big take like that\nmore than once is because every time you\ndo, the danger for the stunt person\nmultiplies.\n Yeah.\n And I was like, how?\nAnd then I thought, oh, well,\n doing it\nmore,\n right? Yeah,\n your your chances of\nof injury are increased the more you\ncarry out the more times you carry out a\ndangerous act. So, yeah,\n that's how it\nmultiplies.\n Uh, getting back to squibs,\nthese days a lot of uh directors are\nopting for CGI blood and uh and bullet\nwounds. Um, but supposedly Quint\nTarantino, and this is out by the time\nthis comes out, Jango and Chain.\n Man, I\ncan't wait to see supposedly he uh had\n100% real squibs and the blood like\nthey're supposed to be the bloodiest\nnastiest squibs that Hollywood has seen\nin years.\n Is that right?\n Yeah, it's\nsupposed to be pretty awesome.\n Yeah.\nHave you seen a machete?\n Yeah,\n that was\npretty bloody.\n Yeah, that was bad\nthough. I didn't like\n I agree it was but\nit was still pretty bloody.\n Uh they also\nhave blanks. If you are firing a gun on\nset, it is uh probably a blank.\n You\nwould hope so.\n It's not the same as a\ndummy cartridge. No,\n a blank actually\nfires gunpowder, has gunpowder, and\nfires what's called a wad.\n It's like\npaper or wood or plastic. And um but it\ndoes not obviously have shot or or\nbullet.\n No, but there's sometimes when\nthe bullet uh explodes, bits of metal\ncan end up being shot out as well. Yeah,\nthat's how Brandon Lee died when they\nwere filming the chrome.\n Yeah, his was\nactually an accident. There was a bullet\nlodged in the barrel that they didn't\nknow about.\n What? I thought, &quot;Okay, well\nthen I'm thinking of somebody else who\nlike was messing around with a gun.&quot;\nThat was Oh, man. I can't remember his\nname.\n He put it to his head and pulled\nthe trigger and like the water like the\ngases or something killed him.\n Yeah,\nthat was uh I can't remember his name,\nbut it was on a TV show set and he like\ngoofing around put it to his head as a\njoke.\n So, you should never mess around\nwith blanks. No,\n it's very dangerous\nstill.\n No, but there was a bullet in the\nYeah, there was a bullet that got the\nguns mixed up and there was a real\nbullet slug lodged in the barrel that\nthey didn't know about. So, it fired a\nblank, but it ejected that other uh\nthing in Brandon Lee died.\n I didn't know\nthat.\n Yeah,\n man.\n It was one of the\nbiggest uh oopses probably in Hollywood\nhistory.\n Yeah.\n You know,\n I guess you\ncould call it that.\n And I think he they\nthought he was still acting and\ncontinued to roll cameras for a bit\nafterward.\n Oh jeez.\n Even. Yeah. Very\nsad. Tragic. Um\nare we to falling?\n Yeah. Which you'll\ndo. I won't do.\n Yeah. I'll jump off of\nstuff. I've always done that.\n Well, they\nuse these huge huge airbags, right?\nWell, back in the day they did. And if\nyou and if you're doing a fall today,\nthey still will sometimes, but generally\nthese days they have like a bungee type\ncontraption.\n I would still demand an\nairbag.\n Yeah.\n Um they apparently also\nfor shorter falls, they'll take some\ncardboard boxes and they'll cut the\nsharp corners off. Yeah.\n And you jump\nonto that.\n Did you do that when you were\na kid?\n No. No. No. I I always would jump\ninto water. I would jump like onto the\nground off of like the credenza or\nwhatever and now I'm like I wouldn't\neven do that. That's dangerous.\n Uh falls\nused to be the thing like I'm sure you\nremember as a kid falls were a really\nbig deal for stuntmen.\n And Dar Robinson,\nremember that guy?\n No.\n He did the the\nSharkies machine fall.\n Okay.\n In Atlanta\nand the Bert Reynolds movie.\n Nope.\n It's\nvery famous fall out of the Peach Street\nPlaza Hotel.\n I was up in Toledo at the\ntime.\n It was still It was released in\nToledo. Not until you know.\n Sharks\nmachine one. Yeah. Uh\n wait. Off the off\nof which hotel?\n He he went through a\nwindow of the Peach Tree Plaza and uh\ninto onto an airbag. And it's just it\nwas one of the famous early falls in and\nor not early falls, but one of the\nfamous falls.\n What floor did he jump out\nof?\n Oh man, I can't remember.\n Was it\npretty high?\n Yeah, I mean it was over\nover like 150 ft, I think.\n Oh wow.\n Yeah,\nthat's nuts.\n It was pretty cool.\n But\nsee, so imagine planning that stunt how\nmany times they measured\n Yeah.\neverything\n\n\nTo figure out where the airbags needed to go. And then they probably supplemented it with additional airbags. And if they loved the guy at all, they did all this.\nYeah. Stuntmen, when you go to talk to one, if you're on set, you'll be disappointed by the fact that they aren't these crazy dudes like you want them to be. They're actually really sensible because they want to work and earn money, right? So, they want to be really really sure that no one gets hurt. It's a little more boring than you would think talking to them.\nSure. But they are a little nuts.\nYeah. Well, you'd have to be at least a little.\nWhat else, Chuck? Fire. How about fire?\nYeah, I just saw Anchor Man the other night. Remember when they had the street brawl and the guy on fire just walks by?\nYeah. Yeah. That's a pretty serious stunt. Like when you are when you set yourself on fire.\nYeah. Um and there's a lot of safety precautions, but even still, it's you're on fire whether you like it or not.\nYeah. That you're wearing all kinds of uh fire protective clothing and fire retardant and then you're smeared with the flammable gel.\nYep. You have a hood on that protects you. Yeah. As well. Um and there's an oxygen tank in there. So, you're basically just completely wrapped in this outfit. Yeah.\nBut yeah, the flammable gels on and uh they light you and then film you and you're going it's always the waving arms and the oh, this kind of looks the same. And then um they people run over and put you out with fire extinguisher.\nThat's right. But they time it very closely as well.\nOh, I'm sure.\nCuz I I think it's kind of like, well, if we go 12 seconds, he actually will catch on fire. So, we can shoot for 11.5, right?\nUh explosions are a big deal. Obviously, these days there's so many explosions in movies. Um sometimes they cheat a little bit when what's called a technique called force perspective to make it look like the actor is closer to the explosion.\nMhm. Um, and if there's an explosion, you're probably also going to be propelled with the air ram that we were talking about. It's very, it's I would call it a Hollywood trope at this point. The explosion and the dudes flying like 20 ft in the air.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah. That was big in uh Commando.\nOh, yes.\nWeren't there a lot of air rams used in Commando?\nMany. More than I can count.\nThat was such a good movie.\nUh, car chases and crashes.\nYeah, they use rams as well. They may be attached to the car. So, if a car needs to flip, um, you see people like going up on a ramp or whatever.\nYeah.\nUm, and they probably use that if you're just trying to stay on two wheels, but if you're trying to flip, there's usually a ram that pushes the car, pushes it off of the ground, and it flips. Or if you have one coming out of the rear, it'll make it jump really high.\nOh, true. Like in Hooper.\nI don't know all these movies you're talking about.\nOh, dude. Hooper was the stunt man movie with Bert Reynolds.\nI didn't see it.\nOh my god. Hal Needham, very famous stuntman, turn director, directed founder of the Cannonball Run.\nWell, yeah, and director of the movie The Cannonball Run and Smoking the Bandit and Hooper. Hooper was about an aging stunt man, Bert Reynolds, who was challenged by the up-and-comer Jan Michael Vincent. And um, of course, there's the love relationship with Sally Fields. She was in that, too.\nAnd uh, it was good. It was like the best It's sort of the best stunt movie ever because it was about stunts.\nHuh.\nAnd he had a rocket car in that one. That was a big rocket car jump. Nice.\nIt was the big climax.\nI did not see Hooper.\nOh, dude. You need to see Hooper.\nWhat was I watching back then?\nWhat were you? You were probably watching TV and stuff, I guess.\nYeah, it was a little before your time.\nSecret of Nim.\nUm, and like I said earlier, stunt drivers, it's not all like a lot of the stuff you're going to see on TV is stunt driving, even though you might not think it's necessary.\nYeah. Apparently to just pull off of the Sometimes. Sometimes not.\nHow do you become a stunt man, Josh?\nUh, well, apparently, as far as Grainowski says, you basically have to start off as an extra on the set, that's not necessarily true.\nOkay. If you want to if you want to go from the absolute from from zero to stunt man in the slowest way possible, then you would start out as an extra on the set. You have to be a screen you have to be a member of the screen actors guild in most cases.\nYeah. Um, and when you're hanging around the set, you identify who the second unit director or stunt coordinator is and you hand them your headshot.\nThat painted a path to becoming a stunt person that we've kind of laughed at. It is not the only path. But one thing is for sure, to become a stunt person, you need to get to know someone else in that department. And that's really with every film department. If you want to be in wardrobe, you should get a job as a PA and start hanging out with the wardrobe people. If you want to be in makeup, start hanging out with the makeup people. And that's just how it works in Hollywood. There is no degree. You can get a film degree, but come on, that's wasted money.\nJust go to work on a set. You get to know the people in the department and then start bugging them a little bit when they're not busy. Stunt coordinators are a little testy because there's a lot on the line, you know.\nSure.\nSo, you know, if you're a new PA on set, don't run over to the stunt coordinator and start bugging them right away. Pick and choose, right, your time and then give them your head shot and then give them your head shot.\nBut yeah, I what what you're saying is that it's apprenticebased.\nIt is basically there are schools um one uh recommended driving school, the Rick Seaman stunt driving school.\nYeah.\nUh there's also the International Stunt School.\nThat sounds pretty serious.\nAnd this is where you can learn to do some of the stuff, but it's not like you exit with a degree and then show up and say, &quot;Now I'd like to do stunt work.&quot;\nRight? All the rest of you are fired. I have a degree from the International Stunt School.\nUh, and Grabster points out that you should have a large area of specialty rather than one thing.\nI thought this is a very good point.\nYeah, but that this not necessarily true. I've talked to some stunt dudes that say eventually you would like to have a wide range of skills, but a good way to get in is to have one really specific skill that you're great at.\nUm, and you might get that call like this guy's good with wire work or water work and uh or he's a hell of a driver or a really good motorcycle guy.\nYeah.\nUm or a great skier if you're doing like uh what was that? For your eyes only.\nYeah.\nWas that the one that opened up the big ski chase?\nNever say never again.\nI I was definitely Roger Moore.\nOkay.\nI think it was for your eyes only.\nAll right.\nBut it helps to have these skills. Like a lot of stunt people are former motorcycle motocross racers or car uh enthusiasts or they know how to scuba.\nForceback riders.\nstand for horseback riding.\nYeah.\nSo, a lot of them had these skills just anyway and they're like, &quot;Hey, I can I've been driving dirt track for 20 years. Might as well make some money.&quot;\nYeah. Film me.\nThere's books out there, are there?\nSo, You want to be a stunt man by Mark Aspet.\nOh, that's a great name for a book like that.\nThe Full Burn by Kevin Connley. Uh, Fight Choreography: The Art of Non-verbal Dialogue by John Cring.\nAnd then Hal Nem's biography, stunt man with a c a exclamation.\nHad to be had to be.\nYou got uh you said you have a list of actors that do their own stunts.\nYeah, I think most people know this.\nPeople like Jason Stathithm, famous for doing his own stunts.\nUhhuh. I see Zoe Bells on there. I thought she was a stunt person.\nWell, she is. And she was in Death Proof though as an actor, right? And they were like, I guess they include her now because she did that awesome uh hang hanging on to the hood scene.\nI was watching that earlier and it is just nuts.\nIt's pretty cool.\nIt's like she's when she's hanging on it looks like by belts or whatever.\nYeah.\nAnd then she's but she's kind of sliding still across the hood.\nYeah.\nAll it would take is like a half an inch and then all of a sudden she's gone too far and she's off the side of the car.\nYeah, that was it.\nShe's one of the best in the business apparently.\nMan, that's scary. Uh Bert uh Bert Reynolds used to do a lot of his stunts. In fact, he got injured uh pretty bad that led to some bad health problems on set.\nOh yeah.\nOn City Heat, the Clint Eastwood movie.\nUm Bert Lancaster used to do his own stunts.\nHe's a tough guy.\nYeah.\nRemember the movie Tough Guys?\nHe was in that.\nYeah. Yeah. I don't think we mentioned Ben Hur either. That's one of the famous stunts ever. The the chariot race.\nYeah.\nYou want to tell them about it?\nUh go ahead. What do you got? Oh, well there was a uh stunt man named Joe Canut and he was doubling for Charlton Hston and during the chariot race, this big long intense race.\nYeah.\nUm he falls off the chariot and is about to be run over but in true stunt man fashion grabs it, is being dragged. Yeah.\nPulls himself back up and continues on.\nWow. And I think that made it on screen, too.\nYeah. It's in the movie, but that was a real thing. Like the guy saved his own life.\nThat's awesome.\nYeah, it is.\nHarrison Ford, we mentioned uh as far as the ladies go, Angelina Jolie and Cameron Diaz are known for doing stunts.\nUh Arie Schwarzeneagger.\nUh and Jackie Chan, of course, is very famous for doing his own stunts.\nSure.\nAnd it makes a difference, man, when you can tell it's Tom Cruz on the side of that mountain.\nMan, that was scary. Is that really him? Yeah, Emily worked on that shoot on that just that segment in Moab, the the rock climbing segment and that's when famously Tom Cruz was like four hours late and flies in on a helicopter and like the whole crew was waiting around all day for him.\nI hadn't heard that.\nAnd then Oh, yeah. I mean famous in my family.\nOh, good.\nYeah. And now I guess famous to the podcast community.\nYeah.\nCruz is not punctual.\nWell, he wasn't that day.\nWow. Stunts.\nHave you seen Haywire? the Soderberg movie.\nUhuh.\nIt's about uh assassin assassins basically. It's an action movie. Sodberg's take on an action movie. Uh but Gina Carano is a former mixed martial artist and uh she she's awesome and does her own stunts.\nWhat's her name?\nGina Carano.\nI don't believe I know her.\nShe plays the lead.\nI She I think that was her first like legit movie. She's known for mixed martial arts.\nBut um yeah, she does her own stunts and she's ba haywire.\nHaywire.\nI'll check it out.\nI got nothing else.\nI don't either.\nPretty straightforward.\nUh, if you want to learn more about stunts, you can type stunts into the how stuff works search bar. And I said search bar, which means it's time for listener mail.\nJosh, I'm going to call this uh things we I guess say a lot.\nOh, no. Yeah, like.\nNo, no, no. That's not in there.\nOkay.\nEveryone says like, though, I know, but I've pointed out here. They're like you guys say like a lot and I've started to notice and when I say it when I hear the podcast I don't hear it when I'm saying it only later on when I can't do anything about it.\nDon't don't beat yourself up. Everybody says that. Like there are articles written in in the New Yorker about the use of the word like in the 21st century.\nOkay. So you're part of that crowd.\nI know you're no millennial.\nI'm not. I'm an aged person.\nSomething's wrong with me today.\nGuys, before I start, uh I feel like I should get out my adoration of the podcast.\nAlways listen as I'm walking my dog Chloe. Keeps me entertained for hours.\nUm I love that uh you guys are still going strong and I'm very thankful. I have comprised a list, however, of words and phrases used most often in the show besides obvious ones uh like Chuck or Josh or search bar.\nLet's hear them.\nIn no particular order, bada bing, bada boom.\nSure.\nHe left off the bonjovi. She Oh, she uh we'll talk about this later or we'll get to that and then a lot of times we don't.\nYeah. I feel like I say that a lot.\nI think it's hilarious when we we say that we're going to talk about something later and then we just forget to\nYeah.
