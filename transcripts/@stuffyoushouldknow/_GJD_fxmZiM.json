  "cleanText": "Hey everybody, this is Josh, and for this week's select, I've chosen our August 2021 episode on child labor. It's one of those rare episodes that contains a mention of an episode that we should do that we actually did, the newsy strike. So, it's significant for that reason, and it is a fairly bleak episode, as you might guess, but it also goes to show how far we've come.\n\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.\n\nHey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and Jerry's out there hovering around in the digital, um, weird audio ether. And this is Stuff You Should Know. This is going to be a good, uplifting, fun one, and a bouncy, light one.\n\nI think so. And it's, you know, hot off the presses from our, uh, uh, my daughter just wrote this episode for us.\n\nYeah. Yeah. In record time, too. I was impressed.\n\nYou didn't pay her, did you?\n\nNo. Uh, but it's funny. I went to look up, you know, I've talked before about, you know, the fact that I started working when I was 13 at a barbecue restaurant.\n\nUhhuh. And, uh, minimum wage when I started working was $3.35 an hour.\n\nWow. We, how far we've come?\n\nYeah. Not far. They've doubled it in the past whatever 40 years.\n\nIsn't that nuts, dude?\n\nYeah. And you know, we'll get to that, but I have a list of kind of where we ended up with minimum wage along the years. But yeah, JJ's Barbecue. 335 an hour, baby.\n\nWow. That's pretty great. My first, um, uh, job was even younger than that. I was like nine or 10 when I was a paper boy.\n\nYeah. I mean, I couldn't have made more than, cuz I was only, it's not like I was working every night. I was working weekends.\n\nMhm.\n\nI probably made like less than $50 a week.\n\nBut I mean, you're 13. What were you spending it on? 13 in like a good, clean Christian kid. You weren't spending that on anything.\n\nArchie comics. That buys a lot of Archie comics.\n\nYeah, it does. Yes, it does. Although they have a lot of variation. So you could easily spend $50 a week on Archie comics.\n\nOh, back then though, those things were cheap. I was living high on the hog.\n\nBut so it sounds like it, man. It so our buddy Dave, um, helped us out with this one. Dave Ruse, and he makes a really good point that you and I sitting around talking about, you know, you made 50 bucks a week. I was a paper boy, like whatever stresses and troubles that we ran into post, you know, 1970 something.\n\nUm, as far as our first jobs go when we were younger, that does not qualify as child labor. That's that's not really what we're talking about here today.\n\nIt's called a kid having a job.\n\nExactly. It's called you just stop your griping right now because there are actual kids out there who are like real deal child laborers who work in like dangerous conditions for little to no pay, who don't get to play, who may not socialize with other kids their age. They may live and work in a mining camp with nothing but adults and grown-ups.\n\nUm, like, like they, they're, they would, they would kill for, you know, a JJ's barbecue job, basically.\n\nYeah, and this is a good time to be talking about that in particular, uh, because this is 2021 is the international year for the elimination of child labor.\n\nUh, and as you'll see throughout this episode, we've made a lot of strides here in the USA, but like you said, it's not not that way everywhere, and it should be.\n\nAnd I should say, it's probably a little off the mark to say that a child laborer would kill for a better job. They would probably kill to just not have to work at all in general and just to get, get to be a kid. And I think ultimately for people who are activists against child labor, that's the goal is to not like get be better working conditions for six-year-olds, it's to like just make six-year-olds not have to work any longer. And we'll talk about how to solve that, how that, that, um, international year for the elimination of child labor aims to do that. They have some pretty pragmatic ideas. Um, and so hopefully they'll, this, this episode will have a nice bow on the end, but we're going to have to slog through some misery to get there. Chuck, take it away.\n\nThere's no better place to slog through misery than the founding of this country way back in the old days when the new world was new, and settlers came over, and they very much believed. And why, why did I think this was Ed? You said this is Dave. Yeah, I'm almost positive it was Dave.\n\nIt was Ed.\n\nIt reads like a Dave to me, but Oh, man. If it's Ed, I'm sorry.\n\nSorry to both of you.\n\nWell, sure. We need to get those guys together one day.\n\nI, I think the\n\nOr maybe we should keep them far apart.\n\nYeah, exactly. They might, they might turn against us.\n\nUh, yeah, so they believe very much that the idol's hands were the devil's workshop. That old saying. And it, you know, this is one of those, it was kind of hard for me to, you know, let, let's just lop off, you know, developing nations today, which is clearly awful. I found myself as an adult more and more with the cultural relativism thinking, like, obviously five-year-olds shouldn't be working in factories. But when I read about like 12 and 13-year-olds working hard back then, I was kind of like, it's not great, but it was that's just kind of how it was at the time. If you had parents that were farmers, you're not going to, you know, be just hanging out until your sweet 16th birthday having a good time. You're going to be working from a pretty young age. And I found myself more and more thinking like, you know, in certain situations that wasn't the worst thing, but then you get to the industrial revolutions and, you know, that's when things really got bad. But kind of early on, that's really what we were talking about was a lot of kids working on the farms, a lot of boys working on the farm, uh, girls working in the house alongside their sisters and mom. And, you know, this kind of started when they were about 13 years old. They were sort of expected to either go work and get a job and work full-time or to become an apprentice, an unpaid apprentice, uh, to work for food and board and training. And I think also in addition to that Protestant work ethic of like, em, like just completely in the fabric of America that was just coming out in you. It's also this idea of like, what else are you going to do? It's not like you can sit around and play video games or watch TV or do almost anything else except just play outside. Um, but Chuck, I, I went back and looked to see if it was always this way. And apparently in medieval England, you played basically until you hit puberty, and then you started to get put to work.\n\nWhen you hit puberty at four, right? More like 14, but like there was like a childhood, and it seems to have been somewhat wiped out by that Protestant work ethic that the Puritans brought over. Um, or at the very least, it was set back a little more, you know, age-wise where you started working maybe a little sooner than you would have had you been in medieval England at the time.\n\nRight. I think I guess I'm just trying to draw a line between life in the 1640s and then life in 1938 when we eventually did something about it in the US.\n\nYeah. No, totally. And there is an enormous distinction between that, cuz it was, it was like widespread, but it just, it seemed like they were mostly working with their families, and it was just kind of the way that things were. That was how life was. But it, you got to try and like keep your family alive. It's not like\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, they were, they were trying to just all survive, basically, right? And that's actually the reason why it's still around in other parts of the world today. It's not not even necessarily like a, like a work ethic where children should, should work because idol hands are the devil's play things, like the, the Puritans thought. Instead, it's like this is an extra worker we can have go out and make money to keep the rest of the family alive.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe just don't have a choice in not doing that. And that's, that's what drives it still today.\n\nRight. Uh, when the industrial revolution came around, and we're talking about basically cotton factories in a big, big way. Uh, there were a lot of little kids working there, and people like George Washington and Alexander Hamilton thought that was awesome.\n\nMhm. They did. And like, we're going to be skewered for even suggesting that Hamilton said this, but he did. He said that women and children in America would be quote, rendered more useful by manufacturing establishments than they otherwise would be. Um, and I think what he was saying is like, I'm not even going to paraphrase what he was saying. I think it's, it, you can understand it on its face.\n\nYeah. He's saying what, you know, they're not doing much use for us, these kids, and he's mainly talking about kids here who would otherw, quote, who would otherwise be idol. Uh, this isn't Lin-Manuel Miranda saying this. We all love him.\n\nNo, this isn't. He didn't say this in a charming rap.\n\nNo, this is the real Alexander Hamilton, right?\n\nUh, and again, it was just a different time. Um, but even way back then in the early 1800s, not everyone thought this was a great thing. Uh, there was a future mayor of Boston named Josiah Quincy and Joe Quimby who toured a cotton factory, a cotton spinning factory. And they had, you know, four-year-olds working there all the way to 10, uh, maybe 10, 12 hours a day for anywhere from 12 to 25 cents a day, not an hour, right? And he said, uh, compassion calls us to pity these little creatures, flying in a contracted room among flyers and cogs at an age when nature requires for them air, space, and sports. There was a dull dejection and the countenance of all of them. And, uh, you know, we'll get to some of these photos of some of these kids later on. When you look at them, they look like beaten down miniature adults.\n\nYeah. Yeah, they really do.\n\nThey look like us.\n\nExactly. They look ready to retire. They look unhappy. They look, um, yeah, just beaten down, but they're miniature and their kids, their children. And it's really upsetting to see that a photograph of that. I'm sure it's even more upsetting to see it in real life. Um, and that's actually how a lot of this, a lot of change came through was just people being exposed to seeing that and kind of being shocked, having their conscience shocked. But as, as potentially like bad as it was for the children of colonial America who were forced to work, um, it got way, way worse when the second industrial revolution kicked off, the one powered by steam and steel and railroads and and unbridled capitalism. And you inject unbridled capitalism into a, a, um, an economy that allows for child labor, you can imagine that things are going to get much, much worse for the children before it finally gets better.\n\nThat's right. And things did get worse. Uh, when you're, when all of a sudden you have a robust steel industry and coal mining industry. Um, you have railroads that need this stuff in a big, big way, and they, uh, you know, partially kind of ran out of workers and partially just saw what was right underneath their noses, which is these kids who they, at this point, they had long known that they could work and farm and work hard. So they said, you know what, uh, a lot of these families in rural America, farming dried up a bit, so they moved to the city. A lot of it was immigrant labor as, uh, millions of people came into the country from Europe, fleeting their poverty, famine-stricken countries. And no matter where they came from, it was all under the thumb of, uh, the robber barons, which was, uh, I can't remember when we did it. It feels like a few, two or three years ago, but pretty good podcast on the robber barons.\n\nYeah. Yeah, and we also talked about them, uh, in our book.\n\nWe talked about keeping up with the Joneses. They played a big role in that, too. But yeah, so like these, the Robert Barons got rich through innovation, through consolidation, through some pretty clever stuff. A lot of them invented new techniques or processes or procedures. So like they, they definitely were doing something, and they were being productive, but they also got to be filthy rich off of the backs of immigrant labor, child labor that they directly exploited. And, um, it was basically like, there was just nobody looking out for anybody else at this time. It was just such a, a period of such enormous economic insurgence that there weren't, there weren't anybody or there wasn't anybody who was sitting there saying like, whoa, whoa, whoa, everybody, we need to stop and really think about this and do this in a much more directed, smarter, healthier way for our society. It was like, it was like, just go, let's see where this takes us, and a lot of people got trampled underfoot, and that definitely included children laborers or child laborers.\n\nThat's right. And, uh, I think that's a good time for a break. Yay.\n\nYay.\n\nThat's two yays. Any nays?\n\nMm-\n\nSo, we'll be back, and we'll talk a little bit about what some of these jobs might have been, uh, in the late 19th century for these kids right after this.\n\nI wonder how many gallons of coffee everyone who has listened to this, this show since the beginning has heard me drink.\n\nI didn't even hear you drinking for\n\nOh, you didn't when I said Uhuh. I had a, I had a mouthful of cafe. Oh,\n\ninteresting. I have no shirt on.\n\nNice.\n\nThat's awesome, man. You, you just top mine.\n\nYou said no, that's not true.\n\nI think you should have left it mysterious, Chuck, because there were a few people out there who were about to email and say, \"I was offended that Chuck said he wasn't wearing a shirt.\"\n\nYeah. No, I put it on right before we recorded. I had it off.\n\nIt's, it's a little hot. I, I felt like I needed to dress up. Put the t-shirt back on. Right. Do you, are you wearing one of those tuxedo shirt t-shirts?\n\nYou ever had one of those? Did you ever have one?\n\nNo, I didn't.\n\nNo, I didn't either.\n\nYou didn't, you didn't wear them with\n\n\nYour rainbow suspenders?\nNo, that's that stuff was a little too cutesy even for me.\nGotcha.\nOkay. What about the one that looks like I'd wear it?\nOkay.\nWhat about one that looks like a ripped chest and abdomen?\nHave you ever worn a t-shirt like that?\nNo. Those are fun, though.\nI, for certain people, they're fun.\nThey're also like really good at boosting your ego quietly.\nSure.\nThere's nothing like me looking in a mirror at my beer belly covered in spray painted abs.\nRight.\nIt really works.\nYour brain, the brain is so dumb that it falls for it every time.\nI can attest.\nUm, all right.\nSo we were going to talk about what some of these jobs might be, and it kind of really depended on where you were living.\nUm, if you lived in the city or if you lived in a company town where they had these factories, you were going to be working in factories.\nLived out in the rural areas, you'd be working on farms.\nAnd most Americans still lived on farms at the time.\nSo, most child labor took place on farms.\nBut if you were on that farm, uh, you're going to be picking cotton and tobacco.\nYou're going to be picking a lot of stuff and doing all the sort of stuff that goes on after the picking, which is stemming, deseeding, all that stuff.\nShucking.\nMhm.\nYeah.\nThat's stuff I did when I was a kid.\nWe had a big garden, and my mom took us to the canery.\nUh, and it was awful.\nI hated it.\nShe took you to the canery like for a sightseeing trip or for work?\nTo can.\nSo like there was a canery that your mom went to.\nYou guys had so much stuff you had to go to a second location to can it?\nThere was a canery in Dicab County.\nA sort of industrial canery for the people.\nOkay.\nAnd we would take green beans and corn, and uh, we made preserves and all kinds of stuff.\nAnd they had like, and you know, you could can your own junk there.\nSounds like a utopia.\nAnd yeah.\nAnd we would, you know, put Sharpie, uh, like beans on the can on Sharpie and put it in the pantry.\nHuh.\nThat's really interesting.\nReally interesting.\nI had no idea that there was a canery in Dicab County.\nYeah.\nNot too far from where I live now.\nActually, it's like 15 minutes away, probably.\nDo you shudder every time you pass it?\nI do a little, actually.\nI don't pass it much, but it's over near the dog uh pound where you can go adopt a dog.\nAnd so I think we adopted Nico there, and I drove by the canery and just like...\nYeah, I'll bet.\nIt was hot.\nWell, you were lucky you weren't five or six and left there to work all day every day, aren't you?\nYes.\nYou know, for almost no money.\nYeah.\nPennies for a bucket of whatever you shucked or shelled or did whatever, peeled.\nUm, yeah.\nWorking at a canery would probably not have been very fun.\nUm, there were also furnace stoking jobs available whether you wanted them or not.\nWhat else, Chuck?\nUh, well, kids did work in caneries.\nThey also worked in textile mills.\nThey had bobbin boys and bobbin girls.\nThis one doesn't sound so bad to me, but I'm sure I'm missing something that makes it atrocious.\nWell, I mean, they would climb up on the machine and remove the bobbins, the full bobbins, and replace them with empty ones.\nSo, I don't think that was like the worst job in the world, but uh, when you're doing that for 10 or 12 hours a day and you're six, it's it's probably a bit of a buzzkill.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI have a problem inherently with child labor in general.\nYeah, I know what you mean.\nNot like having a job like you or I had first job.\nI got no problem with that.\nBut child, child, any kind of child labor, even if it is kind of cush comparatively.\nNo, I agree.\nThat one wasn't terrible.\nIt may have been dangerous though.\nI don't know.\nThere's no way how those bobbins were.\nYeah.\nThere's no way it wasn't dangerous.\nIt had to have been dangerous.\nWe're talking about the 19th century in industry.\nIt was dangerous in some way.\nThere was no OSHA.\nNo.\nNo one knew what that was.\nIf you did live in the city and did uh work uh around factories, um, you would do that.\nBut there were also plenty of other jobs you could deliver, like be essentially, they call them telegraph boys, sort of delivering, you know, emails basically by hand to people all over town.\nMhm.\nUh, you could shine shoes.\nYou could sell newspapers like you did.\nMhm.\nI didn't stand on a street corner.\nI wasn't a newsy, which we'll talk a little more about newsies in a second.\nI was a delivery boy and not not a really great one either.\nI frequently overslept and um was not good at delivering papers.\nMy mom and my oldest sister would have to do my route once in a while.\nUm, is this a bike deal?\nYes.\nOkay.\nUm, and uh, the thing is is like they also make you shake down the people for their delinquent subscription.\nSo I was like a strong arm guy too for the Toledo Blade as well.\nI want my $2 basically.\nThat's exactly right.\nI, and that was right in my wheelhouse too.\nI was like, \"This hits a little too close to home for me to laugh at this kid.\nI know what he's going through.\nI've had to put my foot in somebody's door before to get their $2.\nDidn't ask for a dime.\nYeah, I haven't seen that in a while.\nThat was a good movie.\nYeah, classic.\nYeah.\nUh, if you lived in the mountains of Appalachia, you might have been a breaker boy.\nUm, or a mule handler.\nAnd breaker boys, we'll get, I guess we can go ahead and tell everyone what that is.\nSure.\nYou would sit around and and break apart lumps of coal into uniform pieces all day long.\nYep, and break dance on your brakes.\nYeah, breaker boys.\nBut that was it.\nAnd they wouldn't let you wear gloves while you were breaker boy, too, because they're like, \"No, no, you can't break these things as uniformly if you wear gloves, you stupid kid.\"\nSo, you you have to basically absorb all of this cold dust into your skin, get all sorts of little cuts and calluses and all that by the time you're six, seven, eight, um, and just do this.\nThis is your life now.\nWelcome to Pennsylvania, right?\nUh, then let's say you managed to escape all forms of formal jobs.\nYour parents, they they didn't make you go to the factory.\nYou did live in the city, so you didn't have to work on a farm.\nAnd you might think you just had it uh made in the shade.\nNot so, because there was plenty of jobs that you could do right there from your cruddy little tenement apartment.\nUh, like weaving baskets or making paper flowers or hand rolling cigars and cigarettes all day long and selling them.\nYeah.\nIt was like, you know, your whole family worked on a farm, or if you lived in a tenement, your whole family worked, you know, in what what are called tenement industries.\nSo there was basically not a lot of escape.\nI get the impression that you basically had to have wealthy parents to not be forced into child labor at the time.\nYeah.\nAnd I might have mentioned this once before.\nMy mom did a thing for a little while where uh, we would make money doing like stuffing envelopes.\nMhm.\nDid you remember that stuff?\nI do.\nAnd I don't even remember what it was for.\nI guess they were for companies.\nOkay.\nI want to say Easter Seals had people do that too, but I'm sure they didn't pay.\nThey're notorious cheap.\nSo, this would be like a company that would have like a packet they would send out that had like five things in it.\nI gotta...\nAnd we would be responsible for getting all that stuff in huge boxes, assembling it all into the envelopes that they could mail, and we would get paid as a family to do that.\nThat's cute.\nThat's super late 70s, early 80s.\nIt's like I can see your mom talking on the princess phone making all the arrangements for them to ship that to her and getting the instructions, you know, and then hanging up and that 50 foot long cord just kind of coils up on its own quietly on the floor.\nYeah.\nAnd I didn't mind that so much because I made a little money, and I could that's something I could do while I watch television.\nYeah, totally.\nTotally.\nWhich is the perfect job as we all know.\nYeah.\nNot exactly a high pressure job.\nIt sounds like I wouldn't even know if that qualifies as a tenement industry to tell you the truth.\nNo, not in the 1970s.\nNo.\nYou had a lot of jobs though as a kid.\nGood for you.\nThat Protestant...\nI always wanted my own money.\nProtestant work ethic shining through like a city upon a hill.\nShould we talk newsies?\nYeah, we should.\nAnd I think also the newsy um strike that we're going to mention deserves its own episode at least, if not its own episode.\nOkay.\nSo yeah, let's just not talk about nies.\nNo, no.\nI thought the same thing.\nAnd the more I got into the strike, I was like, \"This is just too much.\nWe got to do something.\"\nUh, but the idea was that little boys would buy a stack of newspapers wholesale for about 50 cents per 100.\nGirls, too.\nI saw girls that did it, too.\nOh, girls did it, too.\nAll right.\nAnd they sold them for a penny a piece, that they would make half a penny per paper uh selling in the big cities, especially New York City, of course.\nAnd then eventually in 1899, they did go on strike.\nAnd it was a big deal.\nIt kind of ground, I mean, it didn't grind them to a complete halt, but it really disrupted their their flow in getting newspapers into the hands of people.\nDude, the their sales over this two-week strike went down 23.\nYeah, like they brought the, they brought Pulitzer, Pulitzer and um Hurst to to their knees basically, these newsies did, and they got some concessions too.\nYeah.\nAnd I think the deal was is that morning subscribers were generally subscribers, or the morning paper was generally for subscribers, but it was that afternoon paper, that second edition that the newsies really rad it in on because most people didn't subscribe to that.\nRight.\nAnd uh, so they really weren't selling any second editions hardly.\nAnd the one big concession they got, which was huge, was they got them to agree to full buybacks on unused unsold papers, which is a really, really big deal.\nBut it also really kind of goes to show you how much the the the newspaper barons believe newsies were scrappy enough that they wouldn't just sit around and be like, I don't have to sell these, you know, I don't have to worry about this, you know, they they'll be bought back anyway.\nI don't have to work to sell them.\nWell, but buyback just means they give them back the money they paid for them.\nIt's not like they would make any money.\nThey would just, in fact, it incentivized them, I think, to take out more papers.\nYeah.\nAnd sell more papers because they knew they wouldn't be stuck with them.\nYeah, totally.\nWe'll probably edit that part out.\nSo, um, one of the things you mentioned was making cigars like in your family's one room apartment in say New York or something like that, right?\nYeah, that was um, apparently really bad in that not only did you work long hours for very little pain, cramped working conditions with with your family on top of everything else, um, you would frequently come down with nicotine poisoning as a little kid because you're rolling cured, sometimes you're handling uncured tobacco.\nUm, and you're ingesting lots of nicotine through your skin at the like, you know, in a single day.\nAnd so you might be nauseated, you might be dizzy, you might just turn green.\nUm, it can get worse than that too.\nYou actually can suffer respiratory distress as well.\nAnd apparently this is a big problem still with child laborers in Zimbabwe because I think uh about 20 years ago that country doubled down on their tobacco production, and now it's like one of the biggest um the biggest exports of Zimbabwe.\nBut it's also a very poor country, so they use child labor a lot.\nAnd so children are still to this day being exposed to tobacco, and they're rolling, uh, they're handling tobacco, they're rolling stuff, they're rolling cigars, they're um sorting it.\nUm, they're just kids, and tobacco should not be in the same room together, basically.\nYeah.\nIt, you know, it never occurred to me that that I guess it would be a transdermal ingestion, right?\nYeah, totally.\nUh, but sure, I mean, you put tobacco on bee stings and all kinds of things, so of course it's going to get into their skin.\nYeah.\nAnd having gotten myself sick on tobacco a time or two in my life, I can tell you it is not pleasant.\nAnd to to do it against your will just because you're handling it for your job that you don't even want is that sounds torturous, actually.\nYeah, I love that story.\nUh, should you retell it for people who haven't heard it?\nAre you talking about eighth grade in the tree fort?\nWas that when you like smoked a whole pack of cigarettes and got sick?\nIt was more like a pack and a half.\nOkay.\nIt was right after I first started smoking.\nAnd I was like, unbelievable.\nI was like, uh, I really like how this makes me feel.\nLet's see how like 30 of these things make me feel.\nAnd I was sitting there reading comic books up in the tree fort in the woods that my friends and I had built.\nAnd uh, I just went too far, man.\nI felt so bad.\nOh man.\nLike green.\nLike I felt like I looked green.\nIt was it was bad news.\nThat's one of those moments where you like you really wish you could have like video footage kind of what that looked like.\nI kind of hope when when I die it's a little bit like defending your life so they can show, I'll be like, show me that one.\nWe can go over the other stuff, but I really want to see that clip.\nYeah.\nRiptor will be there.\nYeah.\nThe upside of this though is do not ever start smoking.\nI, I deeply regret ever having started smoking as a kid, as an adult.\nDoesn't matter.\nLike just don't ever start smoking and do yourself a real...\n\n\nFavor.\nYou did a great job quitting though, and you never looked back.\nNope.\nI didn't.\nGood job.\nIt was, it was surprisingly easy cuz I was worried.\nHold on.\nOne more thing.\nI think if there are people out there who are considering smoking right now and are worried about the time they're going to have.\nOne of my big worries was that I was going to spend every day of the rest of my life wishing for a cigarette.\nAnd that's just not how it goes.\nLike you, you spend a week, two weeks, if it's really bad, maybe three weeks really longing for a cigarette, and then it starts to get easier and easier, and then eventually you're grossed out by the thought of cigarettes and people smoking cigarettes around you, and you don't ever want to see one again.\nSo, if that's what's keeping you from quitting, don't let it because that's not how it is.\nI like that.\nGood PSA.\nThanks, man.\nThanks.\nUh, I think before we break, maybe we'll just go over some of these final stats here.\nUh, at the basically the peak and about 1900.\nUm, by 1890, one out of every five kids under 16 was working.\nUm, 1.7 million kids under 16, uh, was 6% of the total workforce in the 1900 census.\nAnd that's just kids who were registered to work in these factories.\nLike that does not include these kids rolling cigars in their house or the kids on the family farm.\nSo it was much, much higher than that.\nYeah.\nBecause I think two-thirds of kids, um, in general in the in the country worked in agriculture.\nSo yeah, if they were not counting agriculture, they missed out on a lot of kids in that number.\nAnd that's still a staggering number in and of itself, 1.7 million.\nYeah.\nAnd if you're wondering back then what effect this had on education, uh, just a snapshot from Philadelphia in 1900.\nUh, 15% of 13-year-old boys had left school to work.\nAnd I think half of 15-year-old boys were not in school anymore because they were working or the and like a significant portion because they were naughty, right?\nYeah.\nThey just didn't want to do anything.\nBut get this, this is the staggering one to me.\n17-year-old boys, only 10% of them were still in school in 1900 in Philadelphia.\nThat is, that does not bode well for the future, um, of a of a an economy.\nAnd I think that actually is one reason why public education became so much more compulsory and one reason why people, uh, came around to anti-Child Labor laws is the idea that no, there's a lot more that they could be doing than just working in a factory almost literally their entire lives.\nLike we can do, we can do better, and we can build a better, a better society and a better economy if we invest in their education instead of robbing them of it.\nAll right, I guess we'll take a break and talk about when that started in earnest.\nAnd it wasn't just then when you mentioned it.\nSo, uh, Chuck, um, it turns out that there were, so the progressive era is one of my favorite eras, or I should say the people from the progressive era are some of my favorite people like Francis Perkins, although she was a second or third wave progressive reformer, but she was inspired by some of these earlier ones who were working on things like, um, fair wages, like a minimum wage, minimum or maximum, uh, work days or working hours.\nUm, and then they also train their sights on things like ending Child Labor or at the very least really restricting the amount of work a kid could do, especially, um, in regards to them being in school too.\nThe idea was to put school first and then if the kid had the wherewithal or their parents really needed the money or something like that, they could let them work in addition to school, but the school needed to come first.\nAnd this is really radical.\nI mean, it, it seems radical.\nWe had kids rolling cigars in their one-room apartment in New York their whole lives, and now all of a sudden some people are coming up like, \"No, no, no.\nKids should be in school and then maybe working, preferably not working.\"\nSo, how do we make that happen?\nYeah, it was a very big deal.\nAnd most of these or a lot of them were women, people like Jane Adams and Julia Lathrop and Lillian Ward.\nUm, anti-poverty measures, and this is stuff that, you know, they would also go on to champion, uh, women's rights and women's rights in the workforce and women's rights to vote.\nSo, it was the whole progressive movement was kind of tied up in all these, you know, radical ideas about, you know, being fair and good, decent human beings, right?\nYeah.\nRadical stuff.\nUm, so, uh, here's the problem is you've got these robber barons and these factory owners and then these industrialists who are like, \"Wait a minute, we got a good deal going cuz we don't have to pay these kids much.\nThey're probably not going to unionize.\"\nLike the newsies thing was definitely an anomaly.\nYeah.\nUh, that didn't happen much.\nAnd he said they were like, \"We got a, we got a good thing going, and uh, so we're going to lobby against this as hard as we can.\"\nBut surely they were unsuccessful, right?\nNo, they were successful.\nThey, they blocked a lot of legislation early on, uh, for this kind of regulation, um, federally.\nStates, uh, you know, it kind of depends on where it was, but states did establish Child Labor commissions and some states had some minimum ages, minimum or maximum hours, and minimum wages.\nIt was, um, they were sparse.\nI couldn't find what states passed it, but, um, for the most part there were, there was a, there probably for the most part though there was a, um, a lot of push back and enough push back among the states, um, the residents of the states that that not a lot got passed.\nSo there was a progressive movement that started say in like the 1890s and it had to, it basically like any progressive movement, it ran full steam ahead, hit a huge wall of industry, and then had to slowly just keep pushing and pushing and chugging and chugging and keeping at it for a few decades before it was successful.\nUm, and one of the ways that it became successful or the way that it kept pushing at it after it hit that wall of industry is, um, a group called the National Child Labor Committee formed.\nUh, and I think they formed in back in 1904, and they were basically they became a lobbying group to lobby against the lobbying against Child Labor laws that ended Child Labor.\nYeah.\nUm, yeah, they had a pretty, uh, smart way to get attention.\nAnd, uh, that was in hiring a photographer named Lewis Hine.\nYeah.\nTo go around and sneakily document what was going on with his camera.\nUh, he was, he worked as a sociologist and a teacher and then later became a photographer or was also a photographer, and uh, I think he himself was a kid who was working 12, 13-hour days.\nSo he was like, \"Let me start taking pictures of these kids and maybe that because you know that's worth a thousand words they say at least.\"\nAnd he took 5,000.\nYeah.\nSo that means that he took 50,000 words.\nNo, five 5,000.\n500.\nNo, I know.\nTrying to undermine your confidence in your math.\nThat was totally wrong.\nIt was purposefully wrong though.\nLet me just do that real quick.\nCarry the one.\nHe took five million words.\nThat's a lot of words.\nUm, and if you go back, you've probably seen a bunch of these pictures.\nIf you've seen pictures of very unhappy kids outside of a coal mine or standing on mountains of shucked oysters or standing around, uh, factory machines like little menure adults, they were probably Lewis Hines photos.\nYeah.\nI mean, 5,000 photos all archived in the Library of Congress, um, from what I understand.\nUm, and he had like a really great eye to begin with.\nSo, like they're really great photographs in and of themselves, but you know, you don't have to sit there and like, you know, try to really contemplate it.\nIt just hits you immediately what you're looking at and how sad what you're looking at is.\nAnd so he and the National Child Labor Committee got these into newspapers.\nUm, and like you said, uh, he was very sneaky.\nHe, he would pose as different things.\nUm, one of them made sense to me, the industrial machinery photographer.\nOkay.\nYeah, got that.\nBut what excuse would a Bible salesman have for taking photographs of the kids at the factory?\nI could not find that to save my life.\nI mean, the only thing I would could think is that got him in the door and then maybe he was like, \"And I just love kids and can I take some pictures?\"\nBut I don't know.\nAnd this is a time before stranger danger, I guess.\nSo they were like, \"Sure.\"\nI mean, they're Child Laborers.\nI don't care about them.\nYeah.\nHe also, um, he wore a special jacket where he had the buttons on the jacket aligned in known measurements.\nSo if he went over and stood like he would take a kid's picture and he would ask, you know, they're documented like their names and their ages and stuff, uh, as best he could, but he would go stand next to them if he felt like he couldn't outright ask what their age was to kind of tip off that maybe he was not a Bible salesman, right?\nUh, and you know if the kid went up to the second or third button, he would know roughly how tall they were or no, he would know how tall they were then roughly how old they were.\nRight.\nThe other thing they were giants, right?\nRight.\nYeah.\nI'm sure you know he didn't get them all.\nRight.\nBut, you know, you can't win them all.\nBut the other thing that made it, um, that jacket special, Chuck, was that the lining was made of a t-shirt of a ripped chest and abdomen.\nAnd it would make him feel really good about himself when he put that jacket on.\nOh, that's good.\nNice call back.\nUh, when did things finally change, though?\nUh, well, they started to kind of change.\nLike these, these pictures shocked the conscience of the nation when they when they saw them, when they made them into newspapers and they were accompanied by muckraking articles about how bad these conditions were and you know, shame on you America for turning a blind eye to this kind of thing.\nUm, but it wasn't like an instantaneous switch was thrown.\nIt still took decades.\nI think the first proposal for anti-Child Labor, um, legislation came in 1906.\nSenator Albert Beverage of Indiana, um, was the first to propose it.\nGot taken up in 1916 by the Keating Act that was actually passed, but the Supreme Court shut it down.\nUm, and then there was some more legislation that there was a constitutional amendment actually that got passed but wasn't ratified by the states.\nAnd then it wasn't until the Great Depression and the New Deal that it finally got passed.\nAnd I think if it were just the New Deal, it wouldn't have gotten passed.\nBut the Great Depression changed things socially enough that it opened the door for an end to Child Labor in America.\nYeah.\nLike ironically, I think massive unemployment with so many adults out of work, they couldn't turn around and just hire kids to do these jobs for lower wages.\nIt was, I mean, even at a time when it a bad look didn't really matter as much as as it does today.\nMhm.\nThey even knew that that was a really bad look and that they probably couldn't do something like that.\nSo yeah, uh, eventually the Fair Labors, uh, Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, uh, thank you Francis Perkins, our old buddy.\nThat's right.\nAmong others.\nUm, this finally set a national minimum wage for the very first time, uh, maximum number of hours for workers, and then, uh, Child Labor limitations, notably that if you are under 16, you cannot work in manufacturing and you cannot work in coal mining at all because they're just too dangerous.\nAnother couple of things it did, it established, uh, overtime time and a half.\nOh yeah.\nSo if you went over 40 hours a week, you could only work up to 44, but you could work four hours at time and a half.\nAnd that very first minimum wage was 25 cents an hour, man.\nUh, 1939 it went up to 30.\n45 it went up to 40.\nUh, in 1956 it finally reached a dollar.\nKaching.\nAnd it didn't crack $6 until 2008.\nI know, dude.\nIt's just shameful.\nIsn't that nuts?\nWe definitely need to do a minimum wage episode, too, because it's just not as cut and dried as Yeah, just raise the minimum wage.\nLike, there's just it like there's a lot to it.\nI really want to do one on that.\nYeah.\nI hadn't really kept up with it because I before I got salary jobs, I worked as a waiter for 15 or 20 years or something.\nSo, or or as a PA on movie sets and TV sets, and that's not a hourly thing either.\nSo, like I hadn't had a an hourly rate job since college, so I didn't really know, you know, kind of how it changed over the years.\nI did not know.\nIt was 2008 when they cracked $6.\nThat's really low.\nIt really is.\nIt's very, it's, that's just not okay.\nAnd it's still at 7 something right now.\nIt's not even 775.\nUh, no, it's 725 actually.\nI think it, yeah, that's the national minimum wage, right?\nYeah.\nAgain, some of the states are are raising stuff slowly but surely, but that's the federal one still.\nWell, this says Alabama doesn't have a minimum wage.\nIs that right?\nIs that possible?\nYeah, that's possible, man.\nThat is, have to look into that.\nThat's on the fly.\nSo, um, yeah, we'll do a whole one on minimum wage for sure coming up.\nBut, um, you said that the, the, uh, Fair Labor Standards Act, uh, was, um, uh, passed in 1938, and it still basically governs Child Labor.\nUm, and one of the things that it does, Chuck, is it, it divides, uh, Child Labor into agricultural and non-aggricultural jobs.\nAnd with agricult or non-aggricultural jobs, there's like a, a pretty decent amount of protections, like kids can't work in hazardous stuff until they're 18.\nThings like blasting, mining, forest firefighting, that kind of stuff.\nUm, that if you're under 16, you can only work a maximum of three hours a day during the school year.\nUm, there's some exemptions.\nDid you see the thing about homebased wreath making?\nYeah.\nSo, you cannot, non-aggriculturally, you cannot work if you're under 14 at all.\nLike, I could not have worked as a bus boy at 13, right?\nUh, supposedly, but I still did.\nUm, unless that was passed since then cuz this thing's been ratified a million times or not ratified, but amended.\nUh, but yeah, the\n\n\nIf you're a child actor, you can work if you're under 14, obviously.\nIf you're a newsy, you can still deliver newspapers if you're under 14.\nAnd homebased wreath makers.\nDude, it's so weird.\nIt is weird.\nAnd not only is it homebased wreath making is exempted from child labor laws in the USA, it has to be a specific kind of wreath.\nIt has to be mostly evergreen wreaths.\nWow.\nSo, if you're making wreaths and it has to be at home, if you're having your kid make wreaths at home and they're not mostly evergreen, that's illegal.\nAnd if they're making things out of evergreen that are not wreaths, like say garland, that's illegal.\nSpecifically homemade wreaths that are mostly evergreen.\nIt's really, really interesting.\nIt's one of the most bizarre facts we've ever talked about on this on this show.\nYeah, for sure.\nI'm going to keep that one in my pocket.\nTotally.\nBut agricultural though, they have like very little protection.\nLike almost shamefully little protections.\nYeah.\nIf you're 16 years old and you live on your family farm, they can work you.\nUm, there's no limit on how many hours they can work you.\nYou can work jobs that the Department of Labor considers hazardous.\nI think 14-year-olds also can work unlimited hours if it's outside the school day.\nAnd then kids as young as 12 I think actually 12 and younger can work with parental consent.\nYeah.\nLike basic yeah basically unlimited hours uh or at least up to 72 hours and that's during the school year as well.\nAnd as a result of this uh 55% of child farm workers graduate from high school here in you know the 2020ish.\nYeah.\nIn the USA we're talking about and the 100,000 of them are injured on the job every year.\nChild farm laborers trying to get all this changed.\nYeah.\nThey're basically saying like, look, just just take these things that we apply to non-aggricultural jobs and apply it to agricultural problem solved.\nAnd that would solve a lot of problems.\nI'm sure it would create a lot of problems that you and I are unaware of, not being farm folk.\nUm, but it would solve a lot of the um child labor problems that child labor activists have issues with.\nIt would do nothing for the the the much more rampant problems that are uh endemic around the world with child labor where a lot of it resembles basically uh how America was with child labor at the at the you know during the guilded age.\nYeah.\n158 million kids are uh estimated to be the victims of child labor around the world.\nUh the good news is that's down 30% from 20 years ago.\nUm, but the bad news is is that's a lot of kids and uh I think 71% of those are in agriculture, harvesting, fishing, hurting, stuff like that.\nUh, but there are a lot of kids around the world that still like work in coal mines.\nYeah.\nLike that's too narrow for an adult.\nIt's too dangerous.\nYou go in there and do it instead.\nUm, and they'll work with like they'll work at Wildcat gold mines.\nSo, they're having to like separate gold with mercury.\nSo, they're getting mercury poisoning at a young age, which really messes with you developmentally.\nUm, on tobacco farms in places like Zimbabwe, not only are they having to get um, you know, nicotine poisoning, they're also being poisoned by um, toxic pesticides that are used on the crops and stuff, too.\nSo like the these kids are working in like deplorable working conditions and um there's just some really basic stuff that needs to change that would just free the children of the world, the world around from um what is essentially like indentured servitude right now.\nYeah.\nAnd there's four kind of basic things that the ILO says we can do around the country.\nAnd they like you said at the very beginning, they're very pragmatic.\nThey all make sense.\nMhm.\nAnd they would really make a difference.\nAnd the first is uh expand access to education, uh get kids in school and um get rid of fees to be in school and uh put them if if they're in a school situation, they're way less likely to join the workforce.\nThat that's what our friends at Co-ED do.\nThey they're like helping get kids off of family farms and into schools by removing any barriers between them and in school.\nYep.\nIt's all through education.\nAnd it's a great great organization.\nYep.\nWhat else?\nUh and that's by the way the cooperative I always say that word wrong.\nCooperative for education.\nYeah.\nLook them up.\nWe've championed them for years.\nAnd we got a little uh a little uh fun thing coming up that we're doing with them that you guys might be interested in.\nSo stay tuned for that.\nYeah.\nUh let me see what's the next one.\nHelp families meet basic needs.\nUh this could be a universal basic income.\nIt could be monthly stipend.\nBut basically so families don't have to send their kids out to work to provide at the you know most basic level.\nYeah.\nAnd a way that you can help that is through KA um by lending making microloans to people so that they can they have the capital to grow from uh initially.\nYeah.\nUm there's also like if you make sure that adults are getting better wages and pay and um their rights are protected, it makes their children less likely to be forced into the workplace to begin with because it's not again there's not like adults the world around saying, you know, our kids need to be working because they're lazy.\nLike their kids need to be working because they the adults aren't getting paid enough.\nAnd if you um make sure that you're, you know, if you're a western company and you make sure that you're paying everybody a fair wage, um there's a good chance that you can eradicate child labor from your supply chain.\nYeah.\nUh and then the last thing is just enforcement.\nUh they can put all the laws that they want on the books, but unless someone's going to actually work on enforcement, then it really doesn't matter much.\nSo, uh, that's really sort of the last step is, uh, funding for enforcement.\nYeah.\nAnd Germany actually just passed a law recently that that demands that its companies examine do due diligence and examine their supply chains to see if there's um, child labor involved and to do something about it.\nThat doesn't have like as much teeth as Human Rights Watch was saying that they wish it had, but it's a good first step and hopefully the way that that you know, progressive nations will start moving.\nThat's right.\nUm, two things.\nBig shout out.\nI can't remember uh his name, but the young listener who is mowing the lawn for his dad and wrote in to request this episode.\nI think\nOh, that's right.\nI think he prompted this episode.\nSo, hats off to you, young sir.\nUh, I hope you can kick up your heels for a little while.\nAnd then also, this was indeed a Dave Ruse joint.\nSo, thanks again to Dave for this one.\nRight.\nThat's right.\nSince Chuck said that's right everybody, it means it's time for listener mail.\nI'm going to call this uh I think it's just thanks.\nUh hey guys, writing in from Louisville, Kentucky to say how much I love the show even though Josh said the KFC center was in Lexington.\nI'll never live that down.\nUh your correction put a smile on my face knowing that there are other Stuff You Should Know fans near me.\nUh I work in long-term care and use your podcast many different ways.\nI help people with cognitive impairments set up their tablets and such for enrichment, socialization, and stimulation.\nAnd one of the first activities I show them is how to access entertainment with educational podcast.\nEveryone can find something they want to learn about on Stuff You Should Know.\nI also help people find ways of remembering new information and use your short stuff episodes for those with shorter attention spans.\nAnd finally, my own enjoyment is a factor.\nI listen to many different podcasts during my drive to and from work, but only Stuff You Should Know has the ability to get me into a different headsp space.\nUh, I attribute that to Josh and Chuck.\nNone of these topics would be nearly as interesting without you guys.\nI've cried and laughed sometimes both.\nAll in all of your episodes, even the really mathy ones.\nUh, I feel you on that one, Chuck and Josh.\nYeah.\nOh, that was a dig.\nThat wasn't a dig.\nAre you math guy?\nNo.\nI don't know, but I I like to think I am.\nOkay, sorry about that.\nUh, the episode on snake handling is a personal favorite.\nI appreciate and absolutely love the show and everyone that works on it.\nThanks for keeping it going.\nI hope
