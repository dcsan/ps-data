  "cleanText": "[Music]\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh and there's Chuck and we both have antlers on our head. And this is stuff you should know. Just a couple of wooded Pagans. Yeah, I'm excited about this one, man. Yeah. Uh, you know, we'll reference some previous episodes we covered. Uh, Wicca and our witchcraft up and there's some Aleister Crowley in here, of course. Yeah, for sure. Uh, you knew he was going to make an appearance. Uh, and it seems like there was something else, too. But we'll uh, if you want the full picture, you know, go back and listen to all those together just for a spooky. Why do I say spooky? This is not even spooky. That's the whole problem. Yeah, for sure. Misconception. Yeah. But it's so ingrained that even after you know about it, you know, it's hard not to just shake that stuff. I was a church kid. I was raised Baptist. Pagans were spooky. They they killed and sacrificed things. Yeah. I I I ran across a couple of um websites, Christian websites that essentially still think all of the same things that were that that the church originally said about Pagans back, you know, 1500 years ago. Yeah. So, it's still alive and well. It's cool to know the story now uh having you know left the Baptist church many many years ago to finally understand like oh at a certain point in history they were just like this is the religion and everything else is is the devil right yeah and in retrospect looking at this now it's like gosh talk about getting your wires crossed yeah that's funny um yeah so we're talking about Paganism everybody and uh hats off to Dave too first of Paul for helping us with this. This is a huge big lump of an a topic that almost every one of the things we're going to talk about could be broken out into its own episode. Yeah. So, we're going to have to summarize in a lot of ways. We're going to get a lot of stuff wrong. So, apologies already to all of our Pagan listeners out there and let us know, correct us about what we do get wrong, but we're going to try our best not to get stuff wrong. um because it's a really interesting set of religions. We should say that's what Paganism is. It's not a religion. It's a set of typically nature-based religions that um before the original ancient Paganism predated any of what we call the Abrahamic religions, uh the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. And that's my definition of Paganism.\nCan we stop there? Yeah.\nWe haven't gotten anything wrong so far. So, yeah. Yeah. Well, you mentioned those religions and it's pretty key to mention the Abrahamic religions because basically anything else outside of that was considered pagan historically. Uh the word pagan actually um was an was pretty much an insult at first uh when Christianity was on the rise. And we'll talk a lot about that here in a second. uh in the Roman Empire if you did not convert to Christian uh Christianity you were called uh paganis which is Latin for country dweller which is basically like hey if you're not a Christian you're a bumpkin aka pagan which is interesting oh yeah it's definitely interesting um it's it it's funny because that means that at some point in time and we'll talk about when that happened Christianity suddenly leapt forward as like a sophisticated thing which is so the tables basically turned because originally some of the um Greek and or actually Roman um Pagans were very suspicious of Christianity and said all sorts of lielist things against them and then as Christianity rose to prominence it used that same playbook against Pagans. Um but yeah, it makes sense that it's like you were considered a hick or or um not up to date if you were still a pagan once Christianity became a thing in the Roman Empire. I think Bumpkin summed it up nicely. I thought so, too. I like Bumpkin because it's like it's an insult, but it's just so round and happy that it's hard to be angered by it if somebody calls you a bumpkin. Yeah. For some reason, bumpkin does have just sort of a like I feel like bumpkins are happy, right? They don't care what you think of them. Uh, all right. So, uh, should we talk a little bit about um, you know, there's kind of two parts to this. There's ancient Paganism, uh, which is one thing that we're going to speak about now. And then later we're going to talk a little bit about modern Paganism, but the kind of key distinction here is, uh, modern Paganism isn't like, hey, we just brought back everything they were doing back then because it went away for a long time and now we're going to do that same stuff. It was, you know, inspired by some of this stuff, but as you'll see, not a lot of text survived. So modern Paganism is basically its own new thing. Yeah. Um, and we'll talk about where it came from, but there's a lot of um, well, just incorrect facts on the internet that basically says this this tradition has continued uninterrupted. Yeah. In secret. It had to be driven into secret by the rise of Christianity. And that just does not seem to be true. Yeah. Uh, but if we're going to go back to ancient Paganism, uh, we can talk about some of the different elements of because like you said, this is a lot of different things uh, that are wrapped up under the term Paganism. Mhm. But animism is the first one and that is the belief that every every object on the planet basically has a spirit. Uh people do my dog does your dog does that which I totally believe. Uh the rivers, trees, everything in nature does uh animate or inanimate which is why it's called animism. And they thought that uh nature can be like a great thing. It can help protect us or it can be a dangerous thing. it can cause us harm and it's up to us to influence that through uh sacrifice and these rituals that we perform. Yeah. A good example of this just real quick is um there's no absolute good and evil. That's one of those Abrahamic religious ideas and Paganism does not believe in that. So for example, if you are crossing a raging river, um that river might kill you and drown you, but it's not like the river is evil and wants to do that. It just can happen. So there's a risk, but it can also be a neutral thing. You can increase your chances of successfully crossing that river by maybe praying to it, the spirit or the god of that river or maybe offering a sacrifice. But it's not there's no evil rivers in any of the pagan religions except for the river sticks.\nYeah, I guess maybe. But I think even then it's not necessarily absolutely evil. Yeah. Uh, we've got shamanism, which is sort of like animism plus animism with a mascot. Uh, in that the shaman is the person who steps forward and says, &quot;All right, we've got all these objects that have spirits, and I'm the person that can communicate with them. Um, I will enter a trance, may take some drugs, may do a little singing and dancing to get there. Don't you worry about that. But I'll get there in that trans state and I'll be able to communicate with uh these spirits like go through me.&quot; Yeah. I think the singing and dancing is subsequent to taking the drugs. Hey, I I went to a rave or two in my day. Exactly. Every single person there was a shaman at that moment. That this what it felt like at the time probably. Right. So there there's a couple of things just from the ancient pagan religions that are still carried on today. Um ancestor worship is another big one. Yeah. Um especially as we'll see in the Neo-Pagan Norse traditions. Um, but it's essentially you can see evidence of this in the fact that we buried people in the way that we st we started burying people as if they're venerated, as if we understand that they need grave goods because there's an afterlife. And so it's not like a hard leap to to the idea that those ancestors can help us out now that they're in the spirit world and so you can worship them. That's a that's a big part of it, too. Yeah, for sure. Um then we're going to get into this whole idea that uh and something I found that looking through a lot of these pagan uh rights and religions is that um they looked at women very differently than early Christian and some might even argue late Christian uh religions do uh in that uh women were were worshiped and venerated. There were uh the earth mother was a big part of the the early deities uh and worshiped and they found Venus figurines these uh clay and stone figures from like 35,000 years ago that are clearly like uh probably used in fertility rights because they have you know exaggerated uh breasts on these figures and uh wide hips and so uh the whole idea of the earth mother has been around for a long long time. Yeah. And then you can pretty clearly demonstrate that the earth mother um eventually evolved into Gaia from the Greek pantheon. Gaia is the mom of all the other gods. Uh which brings up another point, polytheism. It's not monotheistic. There is not one single god. Even if there's a head of the gods like say Zeus or Odin or something like that, there's still plenty of other gods who are gods. They're not saints. They're not angels. They're not assistants. They are gods in and of themselves. And so, um, polytheism is a huge, huge part of any pagan religion, ancient or modern, too. And I've never looked into this, but I mean, the idea of mother nature, that probably kind of is kind of a trickle down from goddess mother, earth mother, right? I would think so, too. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I'm just taking a stab at that, though. So, don't you got to be right, you know? I mean, it's not like that was just coincidental. Somebody came up with that in the 60s or something. Yeah, that's true. Uh, what about sacrifice? The stuff that Pagans don't like to talk about. Yeah. I mean, this is a can of worms that um, you know, we can't fully open because there's a lot of debate about how much sacrifice there has been and and all religions throughout ancient world history. Uh, a lot of times these um, the people that say like, oh, they were just killing babies left and right are written by the enemies of these people. uh in this case uh Christian and Roman accounts about how widespread it would be because they're trying to paint them in a certain way. But there definitely has been sacrifice whether it was human or your finest crop or your best sheep. Yeah. I mean, we know for a fact that Germanic and Celtic tribes sacrificed humans just from the presence of bog bodies and the state that they were the way that they died. Um they're pretty much proof positive that there was sacrifice. And even outside of Europe, I mean, you know, the Inca maiden, the Luleo. No, Luleo. Luleo. I think you mean Leilani.\nThe maiden. You remember the Inca maiden that has like your knees pulled up to her chest and she looks like she's sleeping, but she was sacrificed 500 years ago. I mean, like, it did happen, but the idea that it was widespread or that they like drank babies blood or that kind of stuff, that was the exaggeration that really kind of were smears. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I finally watched the other day, uh, it was about a month ago, I guess, the the Mel Gibson, uh, Apocalyptto. Yeah. I'd never seen that for some reason. I finally watched it. How was it? Did you see it? No, but I've seen the scene that made you think of that.\nUh, you know, it was it was pretty good. you know, I'm uh I'm not like a championing Mel Gibson, of course, but uh I just hadn't seen that movie and I had a I guess Emily was clearly not with me and I was like, &quot;Oh, I've got a window.&quot; And it popped up and I was like, &quot;You know what? I never saw that. Let me check it out.&quot; Um very gross and gory in its depictions, but uh you know, it it was okay. Yeah, Mel Gibson is basically into snuff porn, right? Like he loves that stuff. Have you ever seen We Were Soldiers? Uh, I did not see that, but that's supposed to be pretty gory, too, right? It's one of the most violent Yeah. goriest war movies I've ever seen in my life. Yeah. And I've seen The Guns of Navaron. Yeah.\nOh, was that Telly Savalis? No. He was in The Dirty Dozen. That's what you're thinking. Yeah, that was good. Or forced in from Nabon. Was he in that one, too? Or just I don't know if he was in that one. He was definitely in the Dirty Dozen. That was a great one. Yeah. Uh, all right. All right, we're getting away from off topic here, though, because we need to talk about idol worship and tree worship. That's another pretty common element in a lot of different pagan religions. Um, you know, it's right there in the Ten Commandments. Do not worship false idols. Idolatry was a big no no to Christians. And that's basically any physical representation of a god or a spirit. Uh, we usually, you know, growing up Baptist thought of as like statues and stuff from biblical stories, but it can be a rock or something. Uh, and then trees. trees are big in many many most uh pagan religions. They love their trees. Yeah, they love them for sure. Um so yeah, those are some high points or basics I guess is a better way to put it of ancient pagan religions. And because as we said before, there's not a really a lot that survived from the ancients to today, a lot of that stuff has been um gleaned by archaeologists, anthropologists. And um it's from that base of knowledge that modern Pagans draw from to create the newer versions of the pagan religions. Yeah. Uh it feels like a break time, right? Yeah, I guess so. All right, we'll take a break and we'll come back and talk about uh when Christianity decided that's it. We're going to change the narrative right after this.\n[Music]\nAll right. So, we promised talk of Christianity stamping out Paganism or or trying to at least. And that started with Constantine who was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity uh officially. Um\n\n\nI think you sort of hinted earlier that Christianity was a pretty smallish, persecuted uh sect of people at first.\nMhm.\nUh, until Constantine came along and said, \"Actually, I'm Christian now.\"\nAnd, uh, all the other Roman elites were like, \"Well, if Constantine, the emperor, is Christian, then maybe we should look into this a little more.\"\nRight?\nAnd so, the tide turned on pagans basically right out of the gate.\nBut Constantine himself didn't do anything to persecute.\nHe didn't use his official position as emperor to persecute um pagans.\nYeah.\nHe dipped his toe in the pool publicly.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nSo um actually I think he was fully immersed in the baptismal font instead.\nWell, yeah.\nUh his son though went full boore after um pagans and outlawed paganism.\nHe passed the first laws.\nConstantinius.\nConstantius.\nYeah.\nNot Constantinople.\nConstantius.\nYes.\nYeah.\nUm he passed the first laws that that made paganism and practices of paganism illegal.\nUm it was basically amounted to any public displays of paganism were outlawed.\nBut not too long after a couple of decades, his successor Theodosius.\nUm he said Christianity is the state religion of the Roman Empire and if you do anything pagan, including in your own home, um like you're you're toast.\nDon't let us see you go anywhere near a chicken or you're in big trouble.\nAnd they said, \"What is toast?\"\nAnd they went, \"You know when your bread gets too close to the fire and it tastes better?\nThat's I hadn't tried that.\"\nUh so Christianity is on the rise and um they started to stamp out pagan religions all over the Roman Empire through the laws that you mentioned and uh through uh a pretty brilliant plan which was uh literally demonizing them.\nUh I never really have thought about that word much until this as like you know that demon is the root there right uh but that's literally what they did they were like uh you know what uh everyone that you're have been worshiping they are the devil in disguise right like the literal devil Satan yes um and they actually took some of the uh the existing gods and just basically copy pasted them into the conception of the devil of Satan.\nUh and again keep in mind here these these pagan religions they don't have anything even approximating Satan that like gods can be good or evil protective or um dangerous but there's no like one evil yeah um polar foil to God because there is no one god.\nIt's not dual.\nIt's plural.\nThat's that's part of pagan religion, right?\nSo, it's ironic that they're like, \"Your god is Satan.\"\nAnd they're like, \"Which one?\"\nThey're like, \"The one with the horns, the one with the antlers, right?\"\nAnd so, that's that's basically how the modern conception of Satan came along.\nAnd so, basically, any god would just be equated with evil, with a demon, with Satan himself.\nAnd if you were caught practicing this now, you started to risk being killed by the people in charge.\nYeah.\nDave found this one uh pretty prominent Celtic god uh Cernunos.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nOkay.\nC E R N U N in N.\nIt's like it's a Yeah, it's like a mashup of Michael Sarah, John Cena, and John Cenounu.\nUh yeah, sir.\nUh man, I almost said it wrong again.\nCernos was, like I said, a prominent Celtic god and had it was the antler god.\nhad antlers and they they basically look back now and say between cernunos and the Greek god Pan um like it's not a far leap to go from antlers to horns and that was basically the probably the model for the Christian devil that uh you know once they decided hey we're just going to be binary from now on right but the cernunos was wearing antlers because they were they indicated protectiveness not necessarily of humans but of the forest uh in the countryside and you could be in Cern Nunos's good graces by taking care of those things or you could run a foul of Sir Nunos and if you say just stepped on a bunch of docks for no good reason.\nYeah.\nUm but that but he became Satan eventually or he was one of the ones.\nI think they went basically local religion by local religion and identified who could be Satan and then demonized them and all the others.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nIt's like who do they identify with?\nLike who's going to scare them?\nExactly.\nYeah.\nSo now because your god, your ancient pagan god is Satan.\nUm if you are caught worshiping that god or any god and or any kind of polytheistic pagan religion, you're now in league with the devil.\nAnd again, you can be put to death for that kind of thing.\nAnd that developed into witch trials, the Inquisition, all sorts of terrible stuff that was essentially the Christian church persecuting in an effort to stamp out.\nUh it's like any local rival religions.\nYeah.\nWell, stamp out is one thing they did.\nAnd you know, with the Christian armies and colonialism and missionaries, that was what they were doing all over the West.\nUh and then what they couldn't stamp out or or I don't know if it was what they couldn't stamp out, but they were stamping out everything they wanted to.\nAnd then they also said, \"But actually this Halloween and Christmas and Easter are pretty fun.\"\nUh, and those are pagan, you know, based.\nSo, we're just going to tweak those and make them our own because who who doesn't like uh Halloween?\nYeah.\nEverybody likes Halloween.\nUh, which started out as sin as we'll see.\nI think we've talked about that probably 15 times.\nYeah.\nUm, you know what I think actually triggered this um me thinking of this topic?\nWhat movie?\nUh, no, it was Easter.\nUm, I was thinking about I happened to be up and out around sunrise on Easter and I it reminded me as a kid being raised Catholic of going to sunrise mass in Easter and I was like, dude, you're standing there celebrating a religious service, watching the sun rise on a specific day in the spring.\nLike, it is so pagan-based and it's in in like in every single way.\nI think even Easter is like a a shift or an adaptation of like O Stair, which I believe was one of the um polytheistic pagan gods.\nYeah.\nLike it was it's just there out in the open basically.\nAnd that made me wonder about the whole thing.\nYeah.\nYou know, growing up uh in Stone Mountain, Georgia, the the most dedicated would hike up Stone Mountain in the in the dead of night to go to the sunrise service on top of Stone Mountain.\nYeah.\nPretty cool.\nYeah.\nSo they they were basically stamping with one foot, giving back rubs with the other with their hands.\nStamp, stamp, rub, rub.\nThat's what the Christians did to basically win the PR war um of the religions and take over essentially.\nYeah.\nUm if you if you're looking at the pagan comeback, which we're going to get into now, uh you can go back to the Renaissance when they said, \"Hey, the Greek and Roman uh philosophers and all those books they were writing.\"\nIt's like super interesting.\nWe're into that stuff again.\nAnd we have the printing press now, so we can really print this stuff up and disseminate it.\nAnd there were Renaissance painters painting all these amazing romantic uh paintings of like mythological creatures and gods.\nUh and then the Enlightenment came along and said, \"Renaissa, hold my me.\"\nSo yeah, the Enlightenment was like in in a couple of strange ways.\nIt was really fertile ground for um like an interest in paganism to come along.\nFor one, uh the enlightenment thinkers just essentially as a first step just rejected Christianity and monotheism in particular.\nAnd they also were like, I really like the philosophy of these ancient Greeks and ancient Romans.\nThey were polytheistic.\nMaybe I could be too.\nSo it kind of aroused like an intellectual interest in that.\nYeah.\nBut it also um it created an interest in in paganism in a different way too because the enlightenment created such rational thinking that some people were kind of repelled by it and they're like I'm going to go seek answers and purpose in nature instead.\nAnd that you probably more than anything is how the enlightenment led to an interest in paganism.\nYeah.\nAnd I also thought it was super interesting how much the arts played into all this.\nYou know, I mentioned the Renaissance painters uh but also uh romantic poets.\nLike you can't read Werdsworth and Keats and Shelley without like wanting to go out into the woods and like be among nature.\nUh they were very um just very moving poems about the the world the natural world around us uh and the sort of unseen magic in nature.\nYeah.\nYou've never wanted to take your clothes off in the woods, read some Keats, right?\nsee how you feel after that.\nI'm not a I'm not a big naked in the I'm not a big naked guy period.\nI think it's been established, but probably because of the Baptist upbringing, but I feel too vulnerable out there in the woods.\nYeah.\nNo, I get that.\nThere's mosquitoes and beetles and those worms that crawl up your pee hole.\nYeah, I'll just uh you can find me in my skiibbies at least.\nAre you a never nude?\nYeah, I shower in a in a bathing suit in um cut off jeans.\nYeah, the cut off.\nOh man, so great.\nUh what else?\nOh.\nOh, there was another thing that kind of created I it it might have grown out of this interest essentially.\nUm like kind of scholarship on paganism.\nYeah.\nSome was good.\nSome was the kind of stuff that you would equate with finding on the History Channel today.\nYou know, that was in the article and we talked about it a little bit offline.\nI I did not know.\nI don't watch enough History Channel.\nI thought the History Channel was just like we used to call it the War channel because it was always just black and white World War II documentaries, but I know there is another side of the History Channel where with the Alien Sky like did they have a lot of that kind of stuff?\nI think it's pretty much all\nYeah.\nThat is it really?\nOkay.\nYeah, pretty much.\nAnd I think it has been that way for a really long time.\nAnd I mean, not to bag on the History Channel.\nIt's interesting, but um I guess what I'm equating it to is really interesting unsupported theories that like if you're an actual scientist and you look into it, you're like this is just made up.\nThey're trying to make entertaining television basically.\nYes.\nBut the problem is is they present it factually and it gets taken factually by a lot of people.\nSo they've caused a lot of problems.\nThey essentially have ruined the world single-handedly.\nThe History Channel has.\nWell, I'm glad I know this because I'm gonna stop saying well the History Channel said I would stop that.\nYeah.\nUh but yeah, there were a couple of key people that came out of this uh that you kind of referenced.\nUm one was a guy named James Frasier.\nHe was an anthropologist who wrote a book, very influential book in 1890 called The Golden Bow.\nB U I'm sorry.\nYeah, U.\nW.\nJesus, what's going on with me?\nB O U G H.\nI'm going with bow.\nIt's pronounced bo.\nI think that's a History Channel type argument.\nIt it Okay, we're not gonna argue with this because who cares, but uh that's the way it's spelled.\nAnd his argument was that, you know, all religions basically uh go back to this one pagan myth about a king uh that was sacrificed to bless the land with fertility.\nAnd you can kind of trace them all back back to this.\nYeah.\nAnd so modern historians have said that's a great theory, Frasier, but you're it's not correct.\nFrasier is not a history channel type.\nHe was a legitimate anthropologist.\nAnd one of the reasons the golden bow bow figures in is that he did an amazing amount of exhaustive research uh that in the book he describes a lot of ancient pagan traditions and beliefs and stuff.\nSo, the Golden Bow became kind of like a handbook for the modern pagan movements that followed.\nDo you know what I feel like inserting here?\nWhat?\nThe way that you pronounce the word be o like why did they get count Dracula to Who is that guy?\nI I don't know.\nWhat was this?\nLike a book on tape you heard once or No, no, no.\nThis is the YouTube guy.\nWhen you look up pronunciations one gentleman that talks like he came from Transylvania.\nYeah, he really does, doesn't he?\nI never thought about it.\nHe's great.\nWell, now this is saying bow, but I looked it up earlier and it said bow.\nOkay.\nBow.\nBow.\nBow.\nI don't know if I believe that lady.\nLike when the bow breaks.\nWouldn't you just sit up and tell your mom that she got it wrong if she's saying when the bow breaks?\nYeah.\nI've always said bow, but you know, maybe I'm wrong.\nOr maybe the internet's wrong.\nThat'd be a first.\nHow about B?\nYeah.\nWhat's that?\nB.\nWhen the B breaks.\nUh, and then there is a History Channel type person that we should talk about, the Egyptologist Margaret Murray.\nUm, she was she's definitely on that side of things, right?\nYeah.\nShe came up in the Bella and the Witch Elm episode because she was saying like Bella was murdered by a witch cult, right?\nand she's one of the people who argued that the the modern European witches trace their lineage unbroken back to a fertility feminist cult that's been in the British Isles ever since time and memorial.\nAnd that that's one of the things that's been debunked is that it's just not true.\nlike the Christian church uh and in their turn Judaism and Islam as well did such a thorough job of interrupting the transmission from the ancient world to the modern world that it's just like that's just not really possible.\nNow that's not to say that like in certain like super you know rural local areas there's like not folk traditions that actually do date back really far.\nUm, I mean, everybody's seen Wicker Man, but the thing is like like Wicker Man would be actually a bad example because that like is an actual ritual.\nUm, they knew exactly what they were doing.\nThey were performing rights, that kind of stuff.\nThis would be more like, hey, we're dancing around the maple, but we don't necessarily know every single thing that's going on.\num we're not performing every single aspect of this ancient ritual even though the ritual in some form\n\n\nor fashion still survive to today.\nIt's not the full monty.\nIt's not the full monty of the actual pagan folk religion that they're venerating still.\nYeah.\nDoes that make sense?\nYeah, absolutely.\nOkay.\nShould we take our second break?\nYeah.\nAll right.\nWe're going to take that break and we're going to move into the world of modern Paganism right after this la.\n[Music]\nWell, by the way, Chuck, uh, Yumi and I have a friend named Alex Mary who's an artist, and she does something called Morris dancing, and a lot of the Morris dances resemble Paganism.\nLike, uh, there's sometimes there's antlers and stuff like that, but it also more than anything reminds me of stuff they would have done in that A24 movie, Midsummer.\nMhm.\nUm, and it's basically like folk dancing that dates back to like the 15th century and probably before, but they can definitely trace it back that far.\nI was asking her about Paganism.\nShe's like, \"Nope, not a Pagan.\nI'm a Morris dancer.\"\nThat's super cool.\nUh, and not to get off topic, but since you brought up A24, I just have to shout out their newest weird comedy from Tim Robinson.\nOh, yeah.\nUh, actually not from Tim Robinson.\nHe's in it.\nBut, uh, the movie Friendship, I can highly recommend.\nAnd, uh, I went to the opening 11:00 a.m. screening in Atlanta, and my friend is, cuz you love Tim Robinson, you'll be glad to know at Fipps Plaza at 11:00 a.m. on a Friday, there were probably 25 to 30 like Tim Robinson fans in there.\nNice.\nAt that first showing, was it rowdy?\nIt Yeah.\nYou know, it's been a long time since I've seen a crowded And it was crowded because it was probably a 50 person theater, so it was 70% full.\nMhm.\nuh a crowded like movie with other people like a comedy where just a bunch of people are laughing at once and it was so much fun.\nThat's awesome, man.\nIt was great.\nI wish I could have gone.\nI wish you could have gone too.\nOh.\nOh, yeah.\nOh, are you talking about what?\nModern Paganism.\nYeah.\nSo, we mentioned, you know, in several different ways that modern Paganism is its own thing.\nOne of the reasons why it's its own thing is because they just didn't write down a lot of stuff back then.\nAnd stuff that was written down, it wasn't like the literal detailed handbook of how to do this ritual or this, right?\nYeah.\nIt's pretty rare.\nYeah.\nSo, that's one of the reasons.\nAnd it was all stamped out.\nUm, some of the stuff that we've gotten modern-wise comes from these Icelandic or maybe all of it, these Icelandic texts called the Edas.\nIs that right?\nYeah.\nAs far as Norse um religions, Norse Pagan religions that fall under the umbrella term heathenism, this is where they get all their stuff.\nYeah.\nI don't know if it's ordas.\nBut I think I I agreed too soon.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nMaybe that and then the Viking sagas.\nAnd so the Viking sagas aren't like you said, it's not a handbook of how to worship Norse gods, but just mentions of it like like um uh incidental references to stuff like that.\nThe Neo-Pagans who worship Norse gods have kind of taken that, gleaned from that what some of these rituals and and thoughts and mythologies were.\nYeah.\nUm, and we're not going to talk about all modern Pagan religions, but we're going to mention a, you know, we're going to highlight a few.\nUh, we have to talk briefly at least about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.\nBut again, if you want to hear a lot about that, listen to our Alistister, a really good episode, I think, Alistister Crowley episode.\nYeah.\nUh, this was the secret society that Alistister Crowley was a member of.\nUh, he was never the leader, right?\nOr was he just sort of a I think he did break off and try to become a leader at some point.\nI don't remember.\nYeah, maybe I should go back and listen to it.\nI don't remember either.\nBut their whole thing, the reason we mentioned them is they were probably the first what you could consider modern Pagan religion.\nThey practiced magic and they were into the um Egyptian occult stuff.\nSo that's why we bring them up.\nThere's I don't think there's too many Golden Dawn people running around, but I guarantee there are some.\nYeah, there's got to be.\nWhat about Wicca?\nYeah.\nUh we talked about Wicca in our witchcraft episode.\nUm, that was from a long time I think ago though, so it it may not be our best work.\nNo, I would that's one that would probably be pretty good to redo someday.\nWe're not going to redo stuff, are we?\nOkay, fine.\nNo.\nUh, modern witchcraft or or Wicca wa.\nUh originally it was WICA as named by a guy named uh Gerald Gardner who was a British customs official who worked in Malaysia then came back to England in 1936 wrote a bunch of Golden Dawn stuff a bunch of Alistister Crowley stuff a bunch of Margaret Murray stuff our history channel lady and he said you know what one night 1939 a coven of witches uh initiated me uh and they were members of this ancient fertility cult that uh I read about from Margaret Murray\nYeah.\nSo, it depends on who you talk to.\nUm, Gardner might either be um described as a hu um very gentle man.\nI saw somebody describe him who knew him as utterly without malice who who may have made all this up.\nBut he he was known for writing um what's called the book of shadows which has become a big part of um the Wiccan religion which is essentially a personal um recipe book of spells and rituals that is has worked for a particular witch or coven and sometimes it's shared and people can borrow from it and add to it and they create their own book of shadows.\nBut having your own basically you know in those um Bugs Bunny cartoons where that witch is like looking through her book.\nMhm.\nThat would technically be a book of shadows that she's looking through to find like the ingredients for her potions or whatever.\nThat's a pretty literally cartoonish um depiction of it, but that's, you know, essentially what she was doing.\nMy favorite part is when she would uh leave the frame very quickly and her hair pins would fall out of her hair and float in the air.\nShe was one of the most disturbing cartoon characters of all time if you ask me, man.\nYeah.\nlike she was she had that high-pitched voice.\nAnd didn't she have like kind of a red cousin it type who wore like tennis shoes?\nHe was a little offputting as well.\nI don't remember that, but if I saw it, I'd probably know it.\nYeah.\nSo, yeah, the witch from Bugs Bunny.\nThat's right.\nUh, but back to Wiccans, they uh became very popular in the 60s and 70s uh with the the feminist set and uh the environmentalist set.\nAnd they're still the Gerald Gardner focused.\nUm they call it Gardenarian Wicca.\nUh but if you if you're out at the 7-Eleven and you meet a modern Wiccan um she's probably practicing what's called Dianic Wicca, which is uh it's more woman- centered.\nIt came around in 1971 by a Wiccan activist name uh not Susanna, but Susanna Budapest.\nGreat name.\nYeah.\nAnd it wasn't until 200 I think 15 that Susanna Budapest um indoctrinated her first male clergy member into Dianic Wicca and other Dianic Wicca temples split off.\nAnd so it's it's rare to find a man in this um in this religion like it's all women.\nAnd I read that they're antiat patriarchy.\nThey actually try to use their magic against the patriarchy but they're not anti-male.\nThe reason that they exclude males is because their religion is created to um to celebrate and honor the life cycles, the biological cycles in a lot of um cases of a woman as she's born and then ages and then dies and that essentially there's not a lot of role for men in that religion.\nBut yeah, you know, you guys go form your own stuff.\nGo become druids, I think, is their motto.\nYeah.\nAnd here's a little uh dinner party factoid.\nIf someone brings up Wiccan around the table, you can say, \"Hey, did you know that it was actually first recognized as a true religion in 1986 in the United States when the Supreme Court ruled in Detmer v.\nLandon?\"\nYou don't have to know that part, but you could really knock their socks off if you do.\nOkay.\nUh it was where a prisoner was denied the use of ritual uh ritual Wiccan objects and they're like, \"Hey, this is my my religious stuff and the first amendment protects this.\"\nAnd the Supreme Court said, \"You know what?\nYou're right.\"\nYeah.\nProbably a liberal court, right?\nUm, one other thing I got to say, I ran across the UK finally suspended their witchcraft laws, their bans against practicing witchcraft in 1951, which is why Gerald Gardner's books start popping up in the 50s, even though he'd been doing this since the late 30s.\nWow.\nIsn't that interesting?\nlike he could have been arrested and thrown in prison for practicing witchcraft before 1951.\nWow.\nUh all right.\nSo those were s sort of the big heavy hitters that uh were the first big ones that uh of modern Paganism when it staged its comeback but there are dozens of other uh smaller much smaller modern Pagan movements.\nUm, Wicca is definitely the largest, but uh, heathenry is one of them, which is basically a a umbrella term for people who um, like you mentioned the Norse and Germanic deities, right?\nUh, they're really into Marvel, I guess.\nUh, Marvel and um, Lord of the Rings, like if you thought Led Zeppelin was into Lord of the Rings, man, introduce yourself to a heathen.\nLike they are into that stuff.\nLot of Valhalla.\nYeah.\nAnd I think the two biggest Germanic um uh heathen religions actually I guess I don't even think they're sex but um one is uh Asatru.\nYeah.\nUh they worship the Aesir gods who would be the the highest of the pantheon of north Norse mythology like Odin and Thor.\nAnd so people who are into Asatru are very much into honor and valor and getting into Valhalla.\nUm, and then there's the Vanatru, which they're concerned with the Vanir gods, who are the rest of the gods who are more earthy, more nature-based, they're into prosperity, that kind of stuff.\nUm, and I think there's way more than Vanatru right now.\nUm, and then one other thing about heathenism, uh, there's a really interesting like kind of side history that you can go look up about the black metal scene, specifically the Norwegian black metal scene that essentially turned into um, turned their focus from Satanism, like traditional metal, to heathenry.\nAnd so you've got like folk metal, Viking metal.\nUm like they essentially just became heathens but metal and it just got really out of hand in the early 90s.\nIt was really interesting stuff.\nWell, yeah.\nAnd I don't know if we could get a whole episode out of this.\nWe probably could or maybe a short stuff, but there was the very famous case of um well, there were there were these series of arson, these church arson, like 20 of them.\nuh these these very very old wooden medieval churches in Norway that were burned down.\nUh I think 20 of them were attributed uh these arson were attributed to black metal fans and a couple of the arsonists uh were very prominent in the early Norwegian black metal scene.\nUh these guys uh they were bandmates at first in this band Mayhem, but I think Varg uh Vikernes sure he left Mayhem at a certain point, but uh Uranimus is how this guy's known.\nUh Ostein Artha uh Uranomous I think stayed in this group black metal group Mayhem for the run until he was murdered by Var.\nYeah.\nAnd they they didn't exactly like set Paganism's general public image on fire.\nUm well actually they kind of did.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nArth was a Satanist.\nUm Vices is in addition to being a murderer, he's a a vowed neo-Nazi.\nUm and that whole scene in particular kind of gets caught up with nationalism a lot.\nSo it's not a very representative um picture of Paganism as a whole or Neo-Paganism as a whole.\nBut it's still I mean it's just ridiculously interesting what happened there.\nYeah, totally.\nIt's worth mentioning I guess.\nYeah, I remember when this happened and I just I didn't know much about I still don't know much about that whole music scene, but it's it's super interesting.\nMy cousin is into it.\nYeah.\nUm I was checking a lot of it out and some of it's really good.\nI'm not into folk metal though at all.\nWhat is folk?\nWhat is that?\nWhat's it sound like?\nIt's um you know that kind of like super proud Irish music that's like rock from like Boston.\nImagine that is like metal or almost almost Yeah.\nOr no um the the So yes, that that Irish like rock does from Boston.\nThis is like the Norwegian metal version of that.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nI I'll listen to something.\nSee see what it does to me.\nOkay.\nJust look up folk metal and you'll you'll see.\nBut some of the other stuff is really good.\nUm like Mayhem stuff was pretty interesting.\nWhat if this changed my life and set me on a course that one would never have expected here?\n54 years old.\nYou start wearing corpse makeup.\nYeah, maybe get some antlers.\nYeah, why not, man?\nWhy not?\nLike really ask yourself why not do that?\nI mean, no.\nNo, it's no crazier than any of the rest of them if you ask me.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUh you mentioned druids earlier kind of in passing but that is uh a modern um belief system that is tied to pre-Christian um British Isle sort of religion.\nThat's where the druids came from.\nRight.\nYeah.\nAnd I saw that druids are um a big difference between them and others is that that nature itself is the divine.\nIt's not like a manifestation of God or the goddesses or anything like it's nature.\nAnd I also saw that they the practitioners don't really consider it a religion.\nThey consider it more a philosophy or a way of life.\nYeah.\nAnd it's it was uh modern druidry was started by a guy named Ross Nichols.\nAnd I don't know why.\nI just find it funny that like the modern druids and and modern Wiccans were were started\n\n\nBy guys named Ross and Gerald.\nYeah.\nIsn't that a little weird?\nYeah.\nThey sound like a couple of guys who might live in a van together.\nThey might.\nWho knows?\nUh, there's also ceremonial magic, which would trace itself to, I guess, the um, Golden Dawn.\nUh, there's Neo-Paganism, which we should talk about because a lot of people use Neo-Paganism as a term incorrectly to describe modern Paganism, which is what we've been talking about this whole time.\nNeo-Paganism itself is a specific kind of um, Pagan religion.\nSo all Neo-Pagans are Pagan, but all Pagans aren't Neo-Pagans.\nAnd if you basically want to just come at this by saying, \"I like a little of this.\nI like a little of that.\nOh, I, I would like to do a little bit of ritual magic.\nYes, I want to go out in the woods and practice all this stuff.\"\nThen Neo-Paganism is for you.\nIt is wide open.\nThey believe that everybody's beliefs are equal.\nUm, they're very much opposed to the idea of absolute good and evil.\nThey're very into nature.\nIt's pretty much, I think, what people think about when they think about modern Pagan religions.\nAnd that's Neo-Paganism.\nYes.\nAll right.\nAnd if you want to know more about that, there's a great site called neo-paganism.org.\nThey seem to be pretty authoritative on it.\nThey should be with that website.\nThat'd be a real shame if they weren't.\nYeah.\nRight.\nIt's in comic sand.\nAnd just one other thing about Neo-Paganism.\nUm, I think I said that a lot of people, that's what they think of, but they might be saying Wicca when they're talking about Neo-Paganism.\nThere's big differences between those two.\nWicca is very magical-based.\nThe intent is to harness the power of nature to get something done, like get a job successfully or um, make someone fall in love with you, whatever.\nUm, and Wicca is very much esoteric.\nSo that means that there's a set amount of knowledge out there.\nThere's hidden mystery knowledge in the universe that if you are an initiate into Wicca, like you have to be initiated into a coven, um, and you apply yourself and work and study, and you can have these mysteries of the universe revealed to you, not at all what Neo-Pagans believe.\nUm, there's just a ton of differences, but I mean, if any of this has floated your boat, you're like, \"I, I really want to check this out,\" there's a lot of stuff on the internet uh, that you can go read up on.\nI would just say use your, your just general common sense to decide what site you're on is whether it's legitimate or authoritative or if it's just some dude making stuff up.\nGot to have the right font where you know you're in trouble.\nExactly.\nIt's dead giveaway.\nYou also mentioned a great band name in there.\nHidden mystery knowledge.\nThat's a good one.\nI feel like that's more an album though.\nOkay.\nAnd you better believe they're going to have some Lord of the Rings character as the illustration.\nTrue.\nUh, well, if you want to know more about that stuff, like I said, go out on the internet, and uh, since I said that and Chuck had just said true, that means that it's time for listener mail.\nI'm going to call this a popcorn cooking tip I'm surprised I haven't thought of.\nOh, okay.\nHey guys, writing uh, because I want to tell you about my favorite way to cook popcorn in bacon grease.\nOh, yeah.\nI've heard of that.\nI hadn't heard of it.\nIt's just right there in front of my face, too.\nYou got bacon grease in front of your face?\nYeah, I do.\nUh, my aunt taught me her tried and true method for cooking popcorn on the stove top.\nShe puts a spoonful of bacon grease in a skillet, pours a popcorn salt over the grease.\nOh, boy.\nPops a couple of kernels in there and uh, heats the whole thing up.\nAnd when the grease is at the right temperature, those kernels are going to pop and alert you.\nYou can start cooking.\nYou pour in the rest of the kernels, cover your skillet, and let it pop away.\nThe baking grease gives the popcorn a little extra flavor.\nIt really makes it even more delicious.\nYou should give it a try sometime.\nJust don't forget to cover your skillet.\nOkay.\nUh, thanks for all the years of podcasting listening pleasure you've provided for me.\nI wish you both the best.\nThat is from Randy with an I.\nThanks a lot, Randy with an I.\nThat's Did, did Randy sign the I with a little heart instead of a dot?\nCuz that'd be fantastic.\nYeah.\nUh, thanks a lot, Randy.\nThat was a great tip.\nWe appreciate it.\nI'm quite sure everybody who loves popcorn and bacon that's listening appreciated that.\nAnd if you want to be like Randy and send us a tip that everybody can appreciate, you can send it off to
