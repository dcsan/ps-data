  "cleanText": "Good morning, everyone.\nI hope you're enjoying yourself and having a great weekend with friends, family, loved ones, or, I don't know, even people you might dislike a little bit.\nHow dementia works.\nThis is a pretty brutal episode, everybody.\nThis is from November 4th, 2015.\nUh, but there's some really good information in it.\nUh, if you are suffering from dementia or someone in your family is suffering from dementia, you have our uh, deepest empathy because it is tough stuff.\nAnd we hope this episode can bring you a little bit of comfort because knowledge is power and understanding things is what we're all about.\nAnd that can really help sometimes when you're dealing with something as devastating as dementia.\nSo, how dementia works right here, right now.\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.\nHey, and welcome to the podcast.\nI'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant and null.\nThe stint of null continues.\nEverybody's like, &quot;Stuff you should null.&quot;\nNo.\nNo, that's not what we're calling it.\nIt's the stint of null.\nAll right.\nStuff You Should Know.\nThat's too clever.\nYeah, it's a little cutesy.\nYeah, that's all.\nAll right.\nThat's my only aversion to it.\nAll right.\nWhat do you Are you with Stuff You Should Know?\nChanging the name of our show after eight years now.\nNo, just the uh null stint.\nThe name of it.\nRemember the summer of Sam?\nOh, yeah.\nYeah, sure.\nWhy not?\nI don't like it.\nAll right.\nShould we come up with the third idea?\nYeah.\nThe stint of null sounds too much like something's wrong with null.\nThat's why I like it.\nIt's hilarious.\nThere's nothing wrong with null by God.\nAnd if you think there is, you need to answer to me.\nThere's something you should know.\nNow, see, that's what I'm saying.\nYeah.\nIt sounds like something uh Strickland would have come up with.\nYou know, man, we haven't been in a flame war with Strickland in a while.\nIt has been a while.\nIt's been too long.\nIt's gotten soft.\nYou just launched one across the bow.\nSo, um Chuck, yes.\nAre you familiar with dementia?\nUh yeah, sure.\nAre you running in your family?\nDoesn't run in the family, but my grandmother who lived to be hundred uh had dementia at some point, which you know, when you live to be 100, that's I don't know about likely, but it's not surprising.\nIt's probably pretty likely.\nIt's um it's not, from what I understand, it's not a um just a natural consequence of age, right?\nBut it it's pretty prevalent.\nSure.\nUm and dementia is actually super misunderstood.\nIt gets confused with Alzheimer's a lot or there's a lot of different kinds of dementia, but dementia is actually it's not a disease, right?\nIt's a set of symptoms that's brought on by disease.\nYeah, I think that is widely misunderstood.\nYeah.\nUh but you are totally correct.\nA set of symptoms and um it is not just your garden variety um forgetfulness that comes as you age.\nNo, cuz that is age related and normal.\nThat is a totally age related thing.\nIt's called age associated memory impairment and that is uh I think I mean that happens to everyone right it's just like you forget your keys more often that kind of stuff sure but when you do forget your keys more often you go snap your finger and go I forgot my keys again what is wrong with me that's normal one of the big tells of of true dementia is when you don't realize that you're forgetting right so that's that's when it gets scary right and um we said that it's not a natural consequence of age.\nAnd one of the things that I turned up in researching this is we're not exactly sure what causes dementia.\nWe don't even know if some of the telltale signs of dementia are the cause of dementia in some cases or the result of dementia.\nYeah.\nNot entirely certain.\nBut um it is very widespread among the aged population.\nIn the United States, I think 5.3 million Americans have dementia right now.\nWow.\nAnd as our population ages, because the baby boomers are starting to get older, um I think they're expecting something like 16 million Americans are going to have it by 2050.\n16 million is I think how many about how many people have it around the world right now.\nAnd in America alone, we're going to have that number in 2050.\nYeah.\nAnd it's very expensive, actually.\nUh how much money?\nA lot.\nYou ready for this?\nYeah.\nIn 2015, we have spent $226 billion on health care for dementia alone.\nWow.\nUm, and they're expecting by, I believe, 2050 when we are caring for 16 million in 2015, not futuristic, much more inflated $250, $2050, right?\nIn 2015, we'll be spending about $1.2 two trillion dollars on dementia if somebody doesn't do something, man.\nYeah.\nIt's It's very expensive.\nIt's also extraordinarily sad as far as um diseases or symptoms of diseases.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd uh I also want to recommend our May 2011 episode, a podcast to remember.\nOh yeah.\nOur memory episode ties heavily into this.\nSo if you haven't listened to that one yet, go listen to that one either before or after.\nOr if you listen to it and forgot, go back and listen to it.\nThat's right.\nUh so dementia itself is not um diagnosed uh it's not simply memory loss.\nIt's memory loss um along with one of the following at least one of the following one or more.\nUm aphasia which is uh if you can't understand or produce language any longer.\nUh araxia and all these are super sad if you've ever seen them up close.\nUh araxia if you cannot make certain movements even though your body physically is healthy right?\num agnosia, which is uh you don't recognize um objects like the remote control or your grandkids, stuff like that.\nUh and then executive dysfunction um when you have a lot of troubles planning and organizing and reasoning.\nSo that along with the memory loss, at least one of these, you could be diagnosed with dementia, right?\nAnd so like we said, dementia is a set of symptoms, right?\nYes.\nIt's it's actually brought on by disease.\nAnd the most common cause of dementia, I think something like um 60 or 70% or something like that of dementia um cases is brought on by Alzheimer's disease.\nI could have sworn we did one in Alzheimer's, but we have not.\nYeah, I don't think we have.\nI don't know.\nWe've talked about it enough.\nI think it's Yeah, it's popped up plenty of times, but we've never just done a straightup Alzheimer's one.\nAlzheimer's um brings on dementia through um something called neuroiary fibrillary tangles also known as beta I'm sorry tow protein tangles.\nYeah.\nAnd um beta amalloid plaques right.\nYeah.\nAnd the the plaques are like just a protein buildup a sticky protein buildup.\nYeah.\nWhich is so when you when your neurons fire and you have a thought it's an electrochemical process and there's residual that is left behind.\nAnd these residuals can build up in your synapses.\nYeah.\nAnd cause your synapses to not fire as well.\nAnd when your synapses don't fire as well, they start to die off.\nAnd the neurons that are that are that lead from these synapses or lead to these synapses die themselves.\nAnd you have neural loss.\nLike literally the brain cells in your brain are dying off at a rapid rate.\nYeah.\nAnd when it's caused by beta proteins and tow or beta amaloid plaques and tow proteins in the cells, then what you have is Alzheimer's.\nYeah.\nAnd uh they aren't sure the cause of Alzheimer's still.\nUm genetics is uh they think has a lot to do with it.\nUm and you can live with Alzheimer's for a while.\nUh up to a decade, although they said in this article, Molly says 3 to 5 years is uh more common.\nSo yeah, it definitely shortens your lifespan.\nAnd like you said, um genes are definitely part of the risk factors.\nUm a polyoprotein a poloprotein E.\nOkay.\nI think um which is weird.\nIf you have a mutation on this gene, you have a higher risk of Alzheimer's.\nEven though the gene just codes for a protein that carries cholesterol through your bloodstream.\nYeah.\nDoesn't have anything to do with the tow protein tangles or anything like that.\nas far as I know.\nThat's weird.\nUm, also if you have a family history of dementia, you're you you have a of Alzheimer's, you have a higher likelihood.\nUm, and then if you um have Down syndrome, uh you are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's in middle age.\nOh, really?\nYeah.\nInteresting.\nSo, um that's and we will do one on Alzheimer's, but that's how Alzheimer's can cause dementia.\nUh there's also uh vascular dementia which is uh that was a case with my grandfather who he had a stroke and it accounts for about 20% of dementia cases and uh you know a stroke is when you have a a loss of blood supply to the to the brain or a hemorrhage and or blood clot and it can be either um one big stroke event uh which causes a lot of damage and that's a single infar dementia right or it can be a lot of uh the accumulation of uh symptoms because of a lot of little mini strokes you have over the years, right?\nAnd then the damage just builds up and you finally once once that last one that that is the straw that breaks the camel's back.\nYeah.\nAnd you have dementia.\nUm that happens pretty rapidly after that last that last one that last stroke you have.\nYeah.\nAnd that's multi-infark when it's a bunch of them.\nUm and little mini strokes are common a lot.\nSometimes you have them and don't even realize you've had them.\nRight.\nUh with my grandfather, he he had the big one and Oh, really?\nYeah.\nWe talked about this before and I think something about speech, but um yeah, he lost his ability to speak uh you know, English.\nMhm.\nUh so that would be a fasia.\nYes.\nHe couldn't produce language.\nWell, he produced Yes.\nHe could not produce language.\nHe said things, but it you know, it didn't make any sense.\nGotcha.\nBut he had an understanding.\nYou could see the frustration.\nYeah.\nUh, you know, I know how to how I'm supposed to uh my grandmother is driving us, let's say, and he she doesn't know how to get there.\nHe does, and he can't tell her, but he's telling her.\nYeah.\nIt's just coming out all mixed up.\nAnd that's that's a hallmark of dementia is um there's emotional changes in the person because they they're not communicating like they want to.\nsay people aren't responding like they want the people to and they'll get snippy and then ultimately say withdraw.\nThey'll just give up on communicating at all because it's too frustrating or just too sad, you know.\nYeah.\nUm which is a it's one of the common results of dementia.\nIt's a comorbidity.\nNo, it's a complication.\nYeah.\nAnd then and with the uh single stroke event um or actually or with the multi uh strokes, it's different for everyone.\nThere isn't any single like well this is going to happen because this person had a stroke, right?\nIt could be a variety of different things from uh you know paralysis on one side of the face or body uh bowel and bladder control problems.\nHe didn't have any of those.\nHe looked totally the same.\nPhysically he walked and talked the same except for the fact that they weren't real words, right?\nThat was like the most noticeable thing.\nI remember you telling me about your grandfather before.\nI don't remember what it was.\nYou're talking about speech like where Nikki's area or Broke his area.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSomething like that.\nTotes.\nSo with Alzheimer's, it first attacks the hippocampus, which means that it's going to take away your um episodic memory, which is your memory of recent events, right?\nYeah.\nuh and then it starts to move its way into other areas of the brain where your judgment is affected, your speech patterns are going to be affected.\nYour personality is very much affected and changes with Alzheimer's.\nWith Alzheimer's, but not as much with the stroke.\nYeah, with vascular dementia, you know, there might be some other things um where like part of the face is sagging or or the patient can't move their arm or something like that.\nBut yeah, the personality will remain intact because those regions of the brain aren't affected like they are in Alzheimer's.\nYes.\nAnd then in about 5 to 15% of dementia cases, uh it stems from something called uh Louis body dementia.\nUm which we were just talking about, they think Robin Williams might have suffered from.\nHe definitely did.\nHe definitely did.\nYeah.\nThey found in his autopsy he had I think he was diagnosed with it before he died and Okay.\nThat was one of the reasons why he took his life.\nYeah.\nBecause that can cause severe uh intense hallucinations.\nUh yeah, big time.\nDid you look those up?\nOh yeah, man.\nScary stuff.\nlike very apparently a typical one is very brightly colored animal or person.\nYeah.\nThat you see in great detail for many minutes on daily ba on daily basis like just intense hallucinations.\nI'm sure you think you're, you know, losing it, right?\nAnd that's one of the first symptoms of Louisbody dementia.\nUh and it was discovered by Frederick Louie in uh 1912.\nAnd it has has nothing to do with your body.\nA louisi body is uh there are are deposits uh again protein deposits of the alpha uh suclean uh that appear on the brain.\nSo don't think of body in the terms of like your physical body right uh and this is also uh present louisi bodies and Parkinson's.\nSo, as a result, not only are you going to have symptoms similar to Alzheimer's with Louisbody dementia, but also some of the tremors and balance issues of Parkinson's, right?\nWhich is uh super sad as well.\nIs that what Michael J. Fox has?\nParkinson's.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd that's what the movie Awakenings was about, weren't they?\nWasn't it like a group of Parkinson's patients that like LDO worked on?\nWas that Parkinson's?\nI can't remember.\nI think they didn't they didn't realize what they thought they were locked in or something and then they realized their Parkinson's tremors were so acute that they were like they were not even shaking.\nThey were just completely Yeah.\nInteresting.\nThey're just their muscles were totally contracted rather than contracting and relaxing again and again.\nAnd Robin Williams.\nYeah.\nHow about that?\nYeah.\nUh then we have something that used to be well it's called now fronttotemporal dementia.\nMhm.\nUh, it used\n\n\nTo be called Pix disease, but now Pix disease is a specific version, which I couldn't really sus out what the difference is.\nCould you?\nNo, I couldn't either.\nAs long as it wasn't just me, I feel better.\nBut, uh, FTD is a is really an umbrella term.\nUm, it's about, uh, 5% of dementia cases, and it's going to affect, uh, personality and behavior and language like big time.\nBig time.\nI mean it's where your frontal and temporal loes are actually atrophying and shrinking, right?\nAnd the reason why is, um, you remember with Alzheimer's you have beta amalloid plaques and tow protein tangles, yeah?\nWell, with the front temporal dementia, you don't have the beta amalloid plaques, you just have the towel protein tangles, but it's enough to cause massive neuronal loss, yeah?\nAnd this is like, I think a lot of people at first, um, think they might have, um, Tourette's.\nYeah.\nUh, because you can, uh, yell things out, inappropriate behaviors.\nUh, yeah, like if your grandfather suddenly becomes hyperinterested in sex and like likes to talk about it in public or exposes himself to people in public, there's a pretty good chance that he has developed front temporal, um, dementia, or if I did, because, um, it's unusual in that it attacks, uh, younger people.\nUm, it's going to onset between 40 and 75 years old, which, uh, distinguishes it from other types of dementia.\nYeah.\nAnd if your grandfather used to do that stuff already, then that's not the case.\nThe the the key here is that like this has come out of the blue.\nSomebody has really just completely changed in their personality.\nThey might get into really risky behavior like gambling all of a sudden.\nYeah.\nShoplifting, uh, and you like risky investments or like pulling all their money out of the bank.\nYep.\nAnd with Pix disease too, um, the apparently apathy is a big, uh, indicator of this.\nThere's a big personality change and the person is no longer, they have no empathy.\nThey, um, have blunted emotions.\nYeah.\nAnd then they may also be engaging in risky behavior.\nSo basically your grandpa or your grandma has just turned into like the transporter, you know?\nOr me.\nOr you.\nWell, yeah.\nYou're 40 and 75.\nYou lack empathy.\nNo, no, no.\nI'm just saying it's Oh, I see.\nBecause it affects young, like they turned into you.\nOh, no, no, no, no.\nYou have blunted emotions and you gamble.\nUh, there's also Huntington's disease.\nUh, this is, uh, it seems like much more physical in nature.\nUh, uncontrollable movements.\nUh, although there are changes in in personality, but, um, real fidgety, herky-jerky, uh, your brain loses the ability to control coordination essentially, right?\nWhich is, uh, I think, uh, 50% chance of inheriting the gene, but you can live with it for up to 20 years.\nYeah.\nWhich seems like as far as dementia goes, one of the longer, uh, life expecties.\nMhm.\nBut again, I mean, like I would guess this has kind of become clear.\nThe hallmark of dementia is memory loss paired with some other problem like not being able to create speech any longer, recognize speech or not being able to move, that kind of thing, or not being able to plan.\nUm, and like we said, well, we should probably take a break, huh?\nUh, yeah.\nWe got a couple of more types that we'll talk about and then some other good stuff.\nOkay.\nRight after this.\nUh, the last two, actually the last three we're going to talk about because there are many, many other kinds of dementia.\nLike we could spend hours and hours talking about all the different kinds, hours.\nBut, uh, we have talked about Cordzfelt Yakup disease and I can't remember which one and we say that all the time.\nIs there a disease that kills by preventing sleep?\nOh, is that the one?\nWhich we should have rightly called how pron diseases work.\nYeah, because is is a pron infection.\nUh, it's very rare.\nAbout one, um, out of a million people will be affected in any given year.\nLike mad cow disease.\nYeah.\nOr kuru.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nUm, it's a sponge form disease.\nYeah.\nSo crazy.\nIt is.\nIt's very interesting.\nUh, could be genetic.\nUm, but and I thought we also talked about it in organ transplant.\nDid we?\nUh, I think so because it can occur, um, because of infected tissue, uh, that you are implanted with, uh, or from an organ.\nYeah.\nAnd this is neuronal loss due to the like holes literally being eaten into your brain by this disease.\nYeah.\nUm, and then you can also get dementia, um, from when you have HIV.\nUh, if you are a boxer or say a football player in the NFL, you may have dementia from a traumatic brain injury like a concussion or repeated concussions.\nYeah.\nUm, and there are plenty of diseases.\nThere's also, um, reversible dementia, too.\nIf you have a vitamin deficiency, uh, if you, um, uh, take certain medications, um, you can develop dementia, but this is reversible, right?\nFor the most part though, age associated dementia is not reversible, right?\nAnd like we said, it's kind of tricky to diagnose this stuff because it is normal for people to for become more forgetful as you age.\nMhm.\nAnd then to make it even more confounding, if you're a a diagnostician, not only are do people get more forgetful, there's an intermediate stage between dementia, a dementia diagnosis, and just normal age-related forgetfulness.\nYeah.\nAnd that is, um, called mild cognitive impairment.\nSo, if you can catch this, from what I understand, and we'll talk about treatments and everything later, but if you can catch things like Alzheimer's and other, um, other diseases that lead to dementia early, although there's no cure for any of them, you can you can manage them a lot better and delay say death or like the real devastation associated with it.\nYeah.\nBy a significant amount of time.\nBut it's catching it is the tricky part.\nAnd especially if you have dementia, you don't really realize that there's any kind of problem.\nUm, so you're probably not going to take yourself to the doctor.\nNo.\nUh, but you what you should do is listen to your loved ones because they are going to be looking at you a little more closely, uh, than you can, you know, that that, uh, they have more perspective.\nYeah, exactly.\nThat's what looking for.\nUm, so don't get, you know, don't get offended if if a loved one says, \"Let's go get you checked out.\"\nBecause you can do something if you catch it early on.\nRight.\nUnless you're very wealthy and it's your no good nephew that you've never trusted anyway, you know.\nVery true.\nThen maybe bring a lawyer in on it.\nThat's right.\nSee what's up.\nUh, so if you do go get checked out, um, from the second you walk in the door, your doctor is going to be eyeballing you and looking for any signs.\nUm, just from their their trained eye, like you know, from how you walk to the way you answer questions, uh, to how they interact with you.\nUh, they want to know you're they're going to have to know your history, um, because they need to have some context to, uh, compare it to, right?\nLike were you always a compulsive gambler or is this like new behavior?\nYeah.\nAnd it helps to bring, you know, if if, um, if you're older, maybe bring your grown son or daughter with you or whoever has a lot of contact.\nSure.\nSure.\nUh, although your spouse, you never know what.\nI don't know.\nThey may be trying to get rid of you.\nOh, yeah.\nLike that.\nNo good nephew.\nYeah, exactly.\nUm, I'm just kidding.\nOf course, although I'm sure that happens.\nUh, then there are a couple of tests that they usually do in conjunction with one another.\nUm, the mini mental state examination, the MMSE.\nUm, just a lot of basic questions there, um, for mental tasks, but they're coded.\nThe tasks are.\nYeah.\nAnd they're scored individually.\nYeah.\nUm, and when you when you say question three, this person got an eight on Yeah.\nUh, you can go over and be like, \"Yeah, dementia.\"\nAnd it's actually pretty effective actually.\nIt is.\nAnd there's another test that ties into the MMSE that, um, they both indicate one another, which apparently they're both really good at indicating dementia, but this other test is called the clock drawing test.\nDid you look this thing up?\nYeah, I thought it was pretty fascinating.\nIt really is.\nYeah, it seems really like why would someone tell someone to draw a clock at a certain time of the day?\nYeah.\nUsually they say draw a clock and showing that it's 10 after 11.\nYeah.\nAnd it makes a lot of sense in a lot of ways because it draws on all these different kinds or different regions of the brain, different, um, skills, right?\nSo like first of all, you have to remember what a clock is.\nYeah.\nAnd what it signifies.\nThat's a big one.\nWhat it looks like.\nUh, yeah, is a clock isn't made of like squiggly lines or anything like that.\nUm, you have to remember how a clock is laid out.\nThe order that the numbers go in, that it doesn't keep going after 12 to 13, 14, 15.\nAnd then once you got all this, you have to show the hands showing that it's 10 after 11.\nSo the hands won't be pointing at 10 and 11.\nIt should be, uh, the longer hand should be pointing at the two and the shorter hand should be just past the 11.\nRight.\nThat's right.\nThis requires a tremendous amount of brain power even though it's very simple and straightforward and you can tell a lot about a person's mental faculties just by having them draw this.\nYeah.\nThe four specific things it requires are verbal understanding, uh, memory, spatially coded knowledge, and constructive skills.\nAnd if any of those are off in conjunction with the MMSSE, then they're going to have a pretty good idea of where you fall on the dementia scale.\nIf you don't have the constructive skills to pay the bills, you may have dementia.\nThat's right.\nAnd they actually, um, I looked at one study about the clock drawing test.\nBasically, I think it was just a more recent like, hey, let's go in and really look at this thing again, right?\nAnd it checks out.\nYeah.\nThey they stood behind it and said, yeah, it's actually a really good indicator.\nYeah.\nLike it really holds up.\nAnd they I think they developed it in the 60s, but it didn't take off until the 80s.\nAnd then they start 60s thing.\nIt does, you know, but it's something you can do anywhere.\nAnd now they're starting to gather these, um, different clocks that people with different types of dementia are drawing and basically compiling them into a database so you know what to look for even more.\nLike, oh, somebody draws a clock that has like a 13, 14, 15 on it, right?\nThey may have this type of dimension, right?\nOr this one looks like Salvador Dolli drew it, right?\nUh, then they might have this kind of dementia.\nYeah.\nOr they might just be super talented and creative.\nYeah.\nYou never know.\nUm, all right, let's, uh, should we take another break?\nWhy not?\nIs it time?\nSure.\nAll right.\nWe'll be back after this to talk about, uh, treatment and, uh, some of the other, uh, pitfalls of dementia.\n[Music]\nSo, Chuck, we've kind of, um, I think it's it almost goes without saying like the the problems associated with with dementia, like you lose your ability to, um, reason in a lot of cases.\nYou lose your ability to to move and take care of yourself.\nYou lose your memories.\nYou have trouble forming new memories.\nYou have trouble recognizing people.\nUm, so living life is extremely difficult.\nYeah.\nUm, but there's also like other complications that you may or may not think of, right?\nSo let's say you're an elderly person and you have a battery of medications that you need to take for unrelated heart disease.\nYeah.\nDo you think you're going to remember to take those medications?\nRight.\nProbably not.\nEven if you have like a timer set or some sort of calendar or something like that, you may have trouble even remembering that you have a calendar that you need to go check out to see what's on there, let alone to take the medication that's indicated that's on that calendar.\nYeah, that's a big problem.\nUh, nutrition itself is a big problem.\nUh, either you forget to eat altogether or you think you've already eaten or you, uh, physically have deteriorated so that you can't control the muscles to chew and, uh, to chew and swallow and you could, uh, choke, right?\nIt's a real danger.\nSo, when people die from Alzheimer's, it sounds kind of strange if you think about it.\nIt's like, well, no, they forgot they lost their memory or whatever.\nIt's like, no, the brain is actually being slowly destroyed.\nYeah.\nPeriodically and eventually it's going to reach the parts of the brain where like you can't swallow any longer and then you die from that kind of thing.\nUm, you also can lose your sense of hunger like you just aren't hungry anymore.\nYeah, it's kind of tough to eat especially when you're not thinking or remembering that you should eat, um, when you're just not hungry ever.\nYeah, it's a tough one.\nUh, hygiene, uh, reduce hygiene is a big one.\nUm, a lot of times in severe dementia cases, you either are unable to bathe and dress yourself and brush your teeth or you forget to, uh, it just falls by the wayside.\nUm, I know that was the case with my grandmother.\nShe needed, you know, she needed to be bathed, uh, by my dad cuz she lost interest in it or because she just couldn't do it anymore.\nUh, I think both.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUm, that's another indicator.\nYou said that when you go in for a diagnosis, the doctor's going to be watching you and and just kind of sizing you up.\nOne of the things to look for is whether you look disheveled.\nYeah.\nThat's a big one.\nAnd especially if you're son or daughter saying like this is really bizarre behavior because mom always like dressed to the nines.\nYeah.\nWhen she left the house, she just wears this dirty old bathrobe all the time and doesn't ever want to take a shower.\nYeah.\nThat's that's usually an indicator of dementia.\nYeah.\nIt's not like she just gave up and doesn't care anymore, right?\nIt's it's part of the symptoms.\nYeah.\nTaking hold.\nAlthough another problem with dementia and and one of the confounding factors is that depression can be a byproduct or comorbidity of dementia.\nYeah.\nBecause you recognize that your life is changing in ways that you're not happy about.\nYou can't communicate anymore.\nYou forget stuff all the time.\nYou can become depressed.\nUm, so then that could lead to you giving up on taking showers.\n\n\nAnd dressing as well. Yeah. And not only depressed but um agitated and aggressive, um riddled with anxiety. Uh, a lot of your emotional well-being and emotional health will be uh slipping away from you. Yeah. And again, this can be a direct result of chemical changes in your brain. Yeah, due to dementia, or it can be like you're this is the result of you recognizing these changes and and just becoming upset about them. Uh, we talked about communication um and the hallucinations. Uh, you're going to have trouble sleeping as well in a lot of cases. Yeah. Uh, and then personal safety. Um, a lot of people die every day because of accidents that happen as a result of dementia. Right. People who shouldn't be driving get into cars. Yeah. Um, and there's this there's a a push that's going on now. I think in the last year or so, um, as part of the Council on Aging, like the United States Council on Aging, there's a new initiative called the Dementia Friendly America Initiative. Really neat. Yeah. It's basically saying, look, we've got about one in eight people over 65 in the US have dementia. We're about to have way more than that in the next couple decades. We need to be prepared for this kind of thing. So, let's start training America how to recognize the signs of dementia and then how to react to it in a friendly and helpful manner so that people who are wandering around with dementia don't withdraw $80,000 from their bank account and and walk around with it in their pockets out outside. Yeah. And how do you do that? You get some money uh from the government as a grant to go out and uh hire people to literally go to businesses and go to restaurants and talk to waiters and and waitresses. Yeah. Or should I just say waitrons? Sure. Uh, go to banks and talk to tellers, go to uh anywhere where there's interaction with another human. Uh, grocery store checkout people, and literally train them on, like you said, how to recognize it and how to kindly deal with these people. Right. Exactly. Um, apparently one of the things you teach uh people in service industries is not take it personally. Right. That if somebody's behaving erratically or they're using incorrect words and they're of a certain age, the chances are they probably have dementia and there's ways of dealing with it. Um, apparently responding to it in a soft, friendly manner. Yeah. Tends to get results from the the dementia patient. Um, especially if you are not, you mean not being an aggressive jerk, right? Exactly. Just being nice will will Yeah. frequently get good results. Um, and yeah, it is a pretty neat initiative. Absolutely. Um, and and necessary. Yeah. You know, but it's it's I'm stricken by the idea that people are planning out this far ahead Yeah. for this kind of thing. It's exceptional. It is. And scary, but awesome. Uh, so, if you do have a family member, one thing that's um important to remember, there's something called the caregiver burden. Yeah. Uh, that my dad and his wife definitely experience. It is really, really tough. Yeah. On you uh on your family uh and it can actually take a physical toll. Um, they have some stats here. If you uh your risk of death uh as a woman if your husband has dementia increases 28% in the first year after they're diagnosed. Yeah. And only uh 22% for a husband whose wife is diagnosed. Um, and then that's still a pretty significant increase. Oh, sure. Just from the dementia diagnosis. Uh-huh. Yeah. And um, what they recommend in this article is to take care of yourself first. Uh, because they found that if you are not going into this with the right attitude and you are upset or have anxiety, you're just going to do more harm anyway. Right. So get yourself right, take care of yourself, and go into it in the right frame of mind and you'll actually be able to help better. Yeah. And this this caregiver burden or caregiver burnout is a very real thing physically, too. Like you um have low energy, you're you have low productivity, you become snippy, uh, resentful, angry, and you can end up basically mistreating your own parent or spouse. Yeah. Because you're so upset with this horrific disease. One of the hallmarks of dementia is that the that there's no two days that are alike. Yeah. And when you're dealing with the the dementia patient, what worked yesterday isn't going to necessarily work today. Yeah. Well, if you can no longer predict what your life is going to be like from day to day, and you're spending I think I saw this one study that found an average of 22 hours a week of unpaid care Yeah. by spouses, wives, daughters, that kind of thing. Um, you can very easily get stressed out. The main thing you have to do is ask for respite care. Like you can't do it by yourself. Yeah. And I I mean, you could totally see how you could just very easily evolve a really unhealthy dynamic. Yeah. If you're just trying to do it yourself because you lose perspective. This becomes your norm even though it's totally abnormal. Yeah. And boy, you talk about a a really sad way to damage what previously was a good relationship with a parent or something. Yeah. Uh, is devastating. Sure. You know, um, so there are drugs that they use uh to help stave off dementia. Um, mainly right now they are uh, colon eststerase inhibitors. Mhm. Uh, and they suppress colonestase, which is an enzyme that breaks down uh uh acetto acetylthene. Acetyloline. Acetyloline. Yeah. Which we've talked about before. That's what helps transmit uh messages between neurons, right? So that'll help. Yeah. Because if you're not communicating as much as you were before Yeah. at least the communication that is going on can stick around longer. Exactly. You know, it's seems primitive as far as like brain drugs go, but it makes sense, you know. Yeah. And then there's another one, uh, are they still using this? Uh, I believe so. Uh, mantene. Uh-huh. Uh, and it inhibitates uh inhibits glutamate, which we've talked about before, uh, which causes neuron death uh, when over stimulated. Yeah. I can't remember where we talked about that one either. I just remember glutamate from the umami episode. Yeah, was definitely in that one. Um, and then there's also stuff you can So, these drugs will help some. That's for non-vascular dementia, right? With with vascular dementia, you're going to want to take blood thinners. Yeah. To keep more strokes from coming along and making the whole thing worse. Um, and then with like Louis body disease to deal with things like the hallucinations and stuff, you'll probably also be given antiscychotics as well. Yeah. Um, and one thing that they're starting to realize more and more, it's very difficult to really figure out what kind of dementia people have just from um, uh, what's the scan? MRI. Yeah. MRI scans. Yeah. Um, and you can really go back and accurately identify types of, um, dementia from autopsies. Right. Right. And so from more and more autopsies, they're finding that there's a lot of what's called mixed dementia where you have Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, right? Or where you have Alzheimer's and Louis bodies disease. Um, and so it can be really tough to sus out all the different kinds of dementia a person might have. But if you can do that, then you can you can put them on a drug regimen that could really kind of help more than just treating the Alzheimer's and letting the Louis body go unrecognized and rampant. Yeah. Yeah. Or unchecked. There's also preventative stuff you can do, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like what? Cross word puzzles. Yeah. I told you Emily's grandmother, Mary, is 95. Yeah. And very sharp. Yeah. Uh, and she does word puzzles all the live long day. And is it Suku? Yeah. She does she does all kinds of word puzzles. Yeah. Things that I have never even heard of. Supposedly that helps stave it off. Oh yeah. Apparently um this one's great. Alcohol, moderate alcohol consumption, which is uh two a day for men or one a day for women. Okay. Uh, has a protective effect. It staves off Alz or staves off dementia. They're not sure why. They're not sure what kind of alcohol is the best. They just know that for some reason alcohol has a pro protective effect. Uh, probably up to that two drinks and then it's probably bad after that. Yes. Then it becomes very bad after that. Yeah. So you want a just moderate amount, right? In all things, people moderation. Moderation. Uh, and then uh, there are some things that you can do. Here's the thing. There's a a debate on whether or not um, you are tricking your loved one by doing things like um, giving them an appliance that doesn't work so they can pretend that they're ironing or something, right? Because they used to love to take care of their laundry themselves. So here, let me remove the cord from this iron. And uh, and is that tricking someone? Is it not? Uh, and a lot of people think no, that's what you should do because it makes them feel like they're being useful. They're not going to get hurt with a hot iron. Yeah. So, it's all good. Other people say no. That means that they're not hanging on to that last bit of reality they may have. Right. I think it's fine. I think it's fine, too. And there's actually um there's a an entire village set up in I think like uh just outside of Amsterdam. Yeah. This is awesome. Called Hogee, right? Yeah. Horve. How would you say that? I I have no idea because Dutch is a weirdest the weirdest language on it. We'll say that. Okay. Okay. Um, and uh, it's a it is a it's an what's called a dementia village basically. Yeah. Where everyone who lives in this village, I think 150 people, all have dementia and they live in group houses that are Well, there's caretakers that live there too, but Okay. Yes, you're right. Um, and they live in the group houses with them. Yes. And a lot of the people realize that this is their nurse or just think it's a a good friend of theirs. Yeah. They they don't really remember where when they became friends. A cool roommate. Yeah. Exactly. Um, and the houses they live in have different themes according to how the people lived depending on whether they were blue collar, whether they their memories go back to the 70s. This whole place is basically set up so that it's a very um non-threatening safe place for these people to just kind of live and um move about within. Sure. Safely. Yeah. Safely. Um, and so they they can go to the grocery store, they can go to the movies, they can go ride a bike. And everyone the people at the movie theater know that the people there have dementia, right? Like every they're real movie theater workers and real waiters in the restaurant. Specially trained. Exactly. So it's a less clinical setting than say a nursing home. And a lot of people say this is awesome because it's as close to real normal life that they were used to as they're going to get. Yeah. Exactly. Uh, then of course there's other people that poo poo and say, &quot;No, you're tricking these people.&quot; But but you can say, &quot;Hey, okay, here's here's the big difference with this place. If this if this dementia patient gets lost in Manhattan and they run across a city worker who's collecting garbage, that city worker may do absolutely nothing to help them. Yeah. In Ho village, yeah, that city worker is specially trained to get that person back to their house or alert their caretaker that this person uh is having a crisis or something like that. It's what we're trying to train people to do in the future. Yes. They've just isolated it to a community. Yeah. Yeah. So there's I mean when you break it down to that distinction, I don't really see anything wrong with it. Especially when you are protecting the the patients themselves. It's not like you're doing it to experiment on them. No. You know, or because they'll they'll produce gold in their urine or something like that, you know, like this is strictly for their protection. Yeah. But also allowing them to to live a free life outside of a clinical setting, right? I don't see much wrong with that. I do get what the bioethicists are saying. Like, yes, you're robbing someone of their dignity by lying to them, by deluding them or playing into their fantasies. Strictly speaking, yes. In the real practical world, I think this is great. If I'm at that point, then and play into my fantasies. Exactly. Please. Um, it is 1984 all the time. Uh, in fact, one of the people that work there say that people that do criticize it, it's a very good point. He's like, &quot;They don't understand what we're doing here. These aren't actors. They're like real employees of these places. They're just helping out, right?&quot; You know, and so Hoj Village, I hope I'm saying that right cuz I'm really putting myself out there. Oh, I'm sure you're not. It's become this kind of ideal standard of care, but it's also really expensive. Yeah, I'm sure. So, in a country where there's a lot of socialized medicine, it could do pretty well, like in the Netherlands or in Canada. Yeah. When they take care of people even though they don't have money. Right. Exactly. There's there's one called um in Canada it's called um Pentanguishini, Pentanguishini Ontario. They have one. It's a little smaller than the one in in uh Amsterdam. They're also building one in Miami as well. So, it is starting to take hold. People do believe in it and apparently the patients families are very happy with this kind of thing too. Well, and hopefully with the initiative of uh what's it called? Alzheimer dementia friendly friendly America. DFA. Yeah. Uh.org. Yeah. Hopefully with those efforts um more and more people will cuz it's coming. Oh yeah, it's coming. A lot more folks are going to be out there that we need to take care of. Yeah. We don't know how to cure dementia. We just know it's coming. I'm going to be one of them. You think so? Sure. At some point if I'm if I make it that long. But you know, not everybody gets dementia no matter how long you live. I don't know. I got a feeling. Really? Yeah.\n\n\nIt does run in my family a little bit.\nYeah.\nAnd and I have the my father's family genes more than my mother's.\nI got you.\nI feel like so if if I had my mother's genes, they all died from heart attacks and strokes.\nOh, okay.\nAnd heart disease.\nYoung.\nNot a lot of cancer.\nYeah.\nPretty young.\nYeah.\nUm, so if you make it past 65, Yeah.\nyou you beat the heart stuff, then the Bryant jeans kick in the dimension.\nWell, we're all going down one way or another.\nI may live to be 100.\nYeah.\nYou know.\nYeah.\nUm, man, I thought of something.\nOh, yeah.\nI wonder, Chuck, if like our spec, like us, you and me specifically, cramming all this information in every week, Yeah. is actually beneficial or if we're just setting ourselves up for massive cases of dementia because we're just pushing stuff in and getting it out, pushing in new stuff and getting it out.\nLike, are we are we abusing our brains or are we exercising it?\nI question that sometimes.\nI bet someone out there I bet there's a neurologist who has a good gut instinct answer to that one.\nLet us know.\nI want to know.\nGood news or bad.\nOkay, neurologists.\nThere's going to be a subject line that just says neurologist.\nGuys, you're screwed.\nYeah, I have bad news.\nUh, if you want to know more about dementia, you can type that word into your favorite search engine and it will bring up tons of information and great resources.\nYou can also type it into uh the search bar, House of Works, and it'll bring up a great article.\nSince I said search bar, it's time for listener mail.\nUh, I'm going to call this one Hecky Krasnaw Lives.\nOkay.\nalthough I don't think he is with us.\nHey guys, only just started uh recently listening to the show.\nIt's been a fantastic way to pass time and learn something interesting.\nI'm a home-taught high schooler, so every time I listen to an episode of your show, I get a history or science credit.\nHow about that?\nThat is pretty great.\nUh but as great as that is, that's not why I'm emailing.\nI actually have a fun fact for you guys uh from your Plato episode in which you mentioned Captain Kangaroo.\nWell, my great-grandfather worked on that show.\nHe produced the songs for it, as well as several uh several Christmas carols, including Frosty the Snowman and his biggest claim to fame, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\nThat is awesome.\nI've always thought it was very funny that a Jewish guy was responsible for the popularity of Christmas carols.\nMy family, all still Jewish, uh watches the Claimation Rudolph movie every year because of that.\nOur own little taste of that irony.\nYeah.\nI I don't want to tell you what to do because I'm sure you have a lot of episodes on your plate already, but I'm just saying Hecky Kranaw was a pretty interesting person.\nUh there might just be enough material for an episode on him.\nUp to you.\nNice.\nThanks for helping with my schoolwork.\nThat is from Aiden in Maryland.\nAwesome.\nThank you very much, Aiden.\nAnd when I say Hecky, Kranol lives, I mean lives on.\nSure.\nLike Viva Leeki.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUh if you want to tell us about someone interesting in your family, we love that kind of stuff.\nAlso, if you are caring for a dementia patient, we want to hear the highs and the lows of that.\nUm just kind of bring it on home for us, will you?\nYou can send us an email to stuffodcastworks.com.\nAnd as always, join us at our home on the web, stuff you should know.com.\nStuff You Should Know is a production of iHeart Radio.\nFor more podcasts, iHeart Radio, visit the iHeart Radio app, APPLE PODCASTS, or wherever you listen to your favorite shows.\n[Music]\n",
