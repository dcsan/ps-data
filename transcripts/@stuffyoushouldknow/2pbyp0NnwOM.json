  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHey, and welcome to the short stuff.\nI'm Josh, and there's Chuck, and Jerry's sitting in for Dave, and this is Short Stuff.\nAnd Chuck, I have come to really detest politics, in particular the um American brand of zero outrage politics that the entire nation's imshed in.\nYeah, I try not to think about it.\nI avoid politics as much as possible.\nSame.\nSo, let's get started about this uh political history story.\nWe're talking about Andrew Jackson and his uh first inauguration uh or his inauguration rather.\nUm, they used to hold these in March, and his was held on March 4th, 1829.\nAnd what happened there at the capital was he gave a speech and did his thing.\nAnd what you should know about Andrew Jackson is he was a very populous president, some say the very first one.\nAnd people loved him, and they were like, \"He's for the little people, and like we want to go meet this guy on inauguration day.\"\nSo he said, \"That's a great idea.\"\nGeorge Washington held these levies at the White House, which is basically come and meet the first family on inauguration day.\nAnd I'm going to do the same.\nBig mistake.\nYeah.\nThere's a just basically a legend of Andrew Jackson's Inauguration in 1829 that they basically tore the roof off the White House.\nThey partied so hard there.\nYeah, and he didn't.\nBut that was the thing you mentioned, he was a populist president.\nUm, all of a sudden because of uh because of him being a populist and and this the people who supported him, average everyday people who typically weren't into politics at all, suddenly overran Washington DC in a very celebratory mood because Andrew Jackson had beaten the Washington establishment, the elites, John Quincy Adams, and now the people were truly represented in uh in in the American government as far as they were concerned.\nYeah.\nBut here's the thing.\nUh, there are historians that say uh hold your water there.\nIt may not have been as wild as everyone thinks.\nThere's a guy named Daniel Feller who was a history professor at uh UT Tennessee.\nI'll even say that as a Georgia fan, and he was the editor of the papers of Andrew Jackson.\nSo he knows a thing or two.\nAnd he's like, \"You know what?\nThey talk about people, you know, wrecking the place, people coming there with muddy boots and turning over tables and punch bowls.\"\nHe said, \"Take that with a grain of salt because all a lot of this stuff comes from the account of this woman named uh Margaret Baird Smith who showed up like late to the party after this stuff had evidently happened.\nShe was tardy to the party.\nTardy to the party.\"\nAnd also did not like Andrew Jackson and his politics.\nSo probably had a pretty um heavy slant on the chaos she described.\nYeah.\nAnd this was, I mean, she was a good example of how the opposition to Andrew Jackson felt like the they felt like they owned DC and Andrew Jackson and his supporters didn't really belong there, right?\nAnd yet because Andrew Jackson had won the presidency.\nUm, and the these like average everyday people felt represented finally, they they showed up.\nUh, the question is like nobody's saying like that didn't happen.\nIt's the degree to which it happened.\nAnd Margaret Bayard Smith's letters uh to her daughter in particular are essentially like one of a very few number of firsthand accounts.\nAnd she's she really did not like this and and pretty much I guess blew it out of proportion is a really good way to put it.\nYeah.\nShe writes about the the majesty of the people disappearing and and a and a mob of people of uh you know fighting and scrambling and what a pity.\nWhat a pity.\nYeah, she said it twice.\nYeah.\nUh yeah.\nAnd is this a how stuff works article?\nUh, this is a Dave Ruse shorty special.\nI should have known because Dave mentions like you can almost hear uh Margaret clutching her pearls in this Dave line.\nRight.\nSo, um, you said she was tardy to the party.\nShe showed up a little bit after three.\nAnd the reason she didn't go straight from the inauguration to, um, the party is because she heard that there were these large crowds.\nThe estimate that has been bandied about all these years later is that there were 20,000 people.\nYeah.\nWho showed up at the White House.\nThat's incredible.\nTo to party.\nSo, I say we take a break and we come back and talk about what they say happened at this 20,000 person strong party at the White House.\nLet's do it.\n[Music]\nLearning things with Chuck and Josh, Stuff You Should Know.\n[Music]\nLearning stuff is fun with Josh and Chuck.\n[Music]\nSo, we said, Chuck, before we broke that there's about 20,000 people estimated to have been at the White House for Andrew Jackson's inauguration levy.\nThat even Margaret Bayard said um or Bayard Smith said that that was probably an exaggerated number.\nYeah, she did say that there were some crazy things going on though.\nYeah, bloody noses.\nUh several thousand dollars worth of worth of glasswware broken.\nUh but here's the thing again.\nThey some historians think she might have been exaggerating because she was just maybe a pearl clutcher and didn't like Jackson.\nUh there was a sen a senator from Massachusetts named Daniel Webster, uh who was not a fan of Jackson as well, but he wrote all about this day and he didn't mention like all this chaos going on.\nHe said you know people have come 500 miles to see General Jackson.\nThey really seem to think the country is rescued from some uh dreadful danger.\nAnd he also said a lot of people were also there to uh like aspiring political um uh politicos I guess trying to maybe uh get a job or get some influence.\nSo he wrote in pretty good depth about this and he never mentioned like you know a party where people were getting in fights and and muddy boots and turning over tables.\nYeah.\nIt was like he he didn't mention that it was it turned into the infield at the Kentucky Derby.\nRight.\nYeah.\nUm, that is really significant because he was there and to not mention like that people were just going berserk partying at the White House and trashing the place.\nI think that to me says volumes about it that e it either was did it happened a little bit but was so insignificant that Webster didn't even think it was worth mentioning or that the whole thing was basically made up.\nYeah, I mean I get the feeling it wasn't completely made up.\nI bet it got a little wild and there are also people that say like, you know, it sounds like there were probably people that maybe stood on tables and chairs to get a better look and like maybe a table breaks when you're doing that.\nBut she made it sound like they just trashed the place, right?\nYeah.\nExactly.\nAnd that not only did they trash the place, they were it wasn't just that there were 20,000 people or however many people were there that they were just rowdy.\nShe was basically trying to portray them as again people who didn't belong in Washington, let alone the White House.\nAnd look, you can't even you can't you can't take these supporters of Andrew Jackson anywhere.\nLook look at what they did.\nThey rushed people carrying out the punch bowls to get punch and free cake and um yeah, they they elbowed each other.\nIt was like a Black Friday sale essentially is what Margaret Smith was describing.\nAnd again, just painting people in a very unflattering light.\nThe problem is this.\nThat was a letter to her daughter, right?\nSo, if her daughter was misled or maybe she was even trying to entertain her daughter, who knows?\nIt would be one thing.\nHistorians would probably still have found those letters and and be talking about it.\nBut the reason why it became such a um a well-known thing is that the press picked that up, too.\nAnd exactly like happens today, that exaggeration was run with to outrage people who were um opponents of Andrew Jackson because that completely satisfied their opinion of those people.\nYeah.\nHere's a bit from the New York spectator that was pretty colorful.\nUh here was the corpulent epicure grunting and sweating for breath.\nThe dandy wishing he had no toes.\nThe tight-laced miss, fearing her person might receive some permanently de deforming impulse.\nThe miser hunting for his pocketbook.\nThe courtier looking for his watch and the office seeker in an agony to reach the president.\nRight.\nWhat does that even mean?\nI I don't know.\nThe uh part about the dandy wishing he had no toes.\nI looked high and low for what that meant.\nUh maybe because they were getting stepped on so much.\nUh maybe.\nI don't know.\nThat's the only thing I could think of that made any sense.\nThe the one I came up with is that uh maybe it was in fashion to have small feet.\nMaybe.\nI know that the Dandy Has No Toes is a pretty great record title.\nYeah, for sure.\nOne of the best deep gut.\nYeah.\nSo, uh the I guess in 1978 the Tennessee Historical Society, they rolled up their sleeves and they're like, \"Let's get to the bottom of this.\"\nAnd from their research, they actually said they said they considered it sheer bedum.\nYeah.\nYeah, but they turned up another account from a senator named James Hamilton of South Carolina who was a supporter of Jackson's and even he said that this was a he called it a regular Saturnelia.\nUh but he also said that most of the damage was minimal.\nSo somewhere in between there Yeah, and Margaret Bayard Smith's account it was probably the truth.\nAnd yeah, I think it was um Daniel Webster who's probably the most reliable.\nYeah, I agree.\nBut who knows?\nIt's a fun story.\nIt is a fun story.\nUh, and we love fun history stories.\nAnd, uh, I guess Chuck Short Stuff is out.\nCorrect.\nStuff You Should Know is a production of iHeartRadio.\nFor more podcasts, iHeartRadio, visit the iHeart Radio app, APPLE PODCASTS, or wherever you listen to your
