root-and-tootin', wholesome, down-home hour of fellowship with Stuff You Should Know.\nWow, you sound like the coolest youth director in the building.\nYou nailed it, Chuck.\nYou totally nailed it.\nThat's right.\nI'm also the only youth director in the building right now.\nThat's right.\nI had to, uh, I had to hang up my spurs.\nYeah, you got run out on a rail, didn't you?\nThey were like, \"If there's one thing that's certainly not cool, this youth director's in their 50s, so you're out,\" right?\nI'm still in my 40s.\nSo, it's kind of like David Bowie said, \"Don't trust any youth director over 50.\"\nThat's right.\nUh, you know, he also sung about Styrofoam.\nNo, he didn't.\nNo, I thought I could get you.\nNo, I could see it.\nI mean, like, it was when Bowie was Bowie, it was Styrofoam was still this amazing wonder product, but I, I got to say, Chuck, I feel like in the last decade or so, maybe it's started to get kind of a bad name.\nI think you're right.\nUh, and we're going to, I mean, we're going to talk about the science of it all, how it's made, and clear up some misconceptions and reinforce some, uh, conceptions.\nUh, but the first thing we should probably clear up, and big thanks to Livia, by the way.\nShe knocked another one out of the park.\nYep.\nUh, is that Styrofoam is a brand name.\nAnd Le, uh, Leia Livia is keen to point out that it's not just like, you know, Band-Aid or Kleenex.\nLike, this one actually matters because the Styrofoam that you and I think of, uh, and most people probably think of as, like, you know, what, what to-go container or, or old-school coffee cup or, uh, to-go coffee cup might be.\nYeah, that's actually not Styrofoam.\nThat's technically something called EPS, expanded polystyrene.\nWhereas the brand name Styrofoam is extruded polystyrene, and that's mainly just like used for insulation and, you know, cut into big boards and stuff like that, right?\nAnd you're like, \"Well, what's the big deal?\"\nThey're actually basically exactly the same products.\nThey have slightly different properties, but it's all the same raw materials, very similar production processes, and the, the final product is, for all intents and purposes, the same.\nThe big difference is the Styrofoam is used for years and years and years and years.\nLike, once you put it in to, to insulate a radiant heat floor, um, you're not going to tear that up after a couple of days and throw it in the dump.\nWith the other stuff, that expanded polystyrene, the stuff we think of as Styrofoam, that's the stuff we use once for a few minutes and just throw away and get another new one.\nAnd that's posing a, a bigger and bigger problem as, as time goes on.\nThat's right.\nUnless you're at my house, then Emily collects every bit of Styrofoam and drives it to the specific Styrofoam place.\nCharm.\nUh, yeah, which still may not be recycling it.\nOh, no.\nReally?\nOh, I don't know.\nI mean, I think Charm does the right thing, but I just, I don't know.\nI, I just think so much of that stuff is dubious once you drop it off.\nLike, who, who knows what even happens to it?\nYeah.\nAnd I don't mean that in a conspiracy-minded way.\nI just mean that as we'll see, recycling Styrofoam, there's just not a lot of reason to do it if you're Styrofoam people, 'cause you can just make it again so cheaply.\nIt's true.\nUh, and for those of you, Yeah, it is sad for sure.\nUh, and for those of you outside of the Atlanta area, Charm is the one recycling center in the entire metro Atlanta area where you can take Styrofoam.\nStands for the Center for Hard to Recycle Materials.\nYeah.\nI mean, God bless Emily for doing all that because I certainly wouldn't.\nI know it's a, it's a haul.\nIt's, it's not really conveniently.\nNeither is saving tons and tons of Styrofoam to go to Charm once a month or whatever, but she does it.\nSo, she's, you know, she does the right thing.\nSo, let's talk about all this stuff because I find it pretty fascinating.\nThere's some science involved.\nThere's some environmentalism involved.\nThere's some corporate tomfoolery involved.\nI'm excited about this one.\nWell, I'm glad.\nGood.\nWell, I'm going to kick it off because Styrofoam, well, let's start.\nWe're talking about polystyrene, and polystyrene is a form of styrene, and styrene occurs naturally in a lot of different plants.\nIt's just kind of part of the ecosystem, but it was first distilled out, um, in, I think, 1839.\nYeah.\nBy a German pharmacist.\nI'm going with Edward Simmon in German, you know.\nI don't know.\nSimone, that sounds French.\nYeah, that doesn't sound very German.\nI mean, just call him Eddie Simon.\nEddie Simon.\nIn 1839, he was a pharmacist who got his hands on a sweet gum tree from America, which was probably very exotic in Germany at the time, and he got styrene out of there.\nAnd he figured out how to take styrene molecules, which are a monomer, and put a bunch of them together to make a polymer.\nAnd what he got was a rigid plastic solid.\nWhat we're talking about is a type of plastic.\nAnd he's like, \"I, I can't do anything with this.\"\nAnd just moved along.\nYeah.\nAnd it stayed that way for close to a hundred years, like 90 years or so.\nAnd finally, in the 1930s, uh, again, a lot of stuff comes about because they're trying to figure out some sort of military use for something.\nAnd that was the case here.\nUh, as we were, you know, between wars, uh, the military was like, \"Hey, how can we, how can we use this stuff?\"\nUm, the literal brand name Styrofoam, which again is the XPS, the, the stuff that's, you know, used in rad flooring and like wall insulation and stuff like that, that was invented a couple of times, uh, the first time by a Swedish inventor named Carl Muners, who developed it in the '30s, but again, didn't have a lot of practical use for it.\nAnd then DAO came along, uh, the, the DAO chemical company during World War II, and they had an engineer, uh, engineer named Ray, uh, McIntyre, who said, uh, \"I'm looking to try and get a synthetic,\" or I guess he was charged with trying to develop a synthetic substitute for rubber.\nYeah.\nHe was facing 5 years for it.\nYeah.\nUh, to use as a flexible insulator.\nAnd he combined styrene with isobutilene.\nAnd what he got was something he didn't expect, which was this very airy, uh, the isobutilene formed bubbles in the styrene.\nSo it was, you know, what we think of as Styrofoam.\nThis super light, very airy, very insulating, water-resistant, flexible material.\nYeah.\nSo, imagine taking something like, imagine taking a CD jewel case, because that's polystyrene, and chopping it up into little tiny pellets, and then you're messing around with it, and, and adding isobutilene, and all of a sudden those pellets just turn it into little foamy balls.\nThe exact same thing that if you have a very lightweight bean bag chair, it's full of those.\nIt's poly polystyrene foam.\nThat's the, that's the basis of the whole thing, right?\nThese little tiny pellets.\nAnd he must have just been as surprised as the day is long.\nYeah.\nWell, Da was certainly surprised and delighted.\nUh, and they were like, \"Hey, let's just start manufacturing this stuff.\nWe got plenty of things we can do.\"\nAnd somebody said, \"Uh, wait a minute.\nThere's this other guy named Carl Muners who already developed, uh, you know, and has patented this concept.\"\nAnd Dow said, \"Great, let's just write him, cut him a check, and now we can patent, um, capital S Styrofoam.\"\nAnd they did so.\nAnd they started saying, \"Hey, you know, we can build like floating docks out of this stuff.\"\nAnd there's all sorts of marine uses, basically, because it floats really well.\nYeah.\n'Cause that extruded polystyrene, the actual Styrofoam brand type, that is very water resistant.\nIt's extremely lightweight.\nIt's very buoyant.\nSo, it just automatically made sense to apply it to different, like, water-based situations, right?\nYeah, for sure.\nUm, as far as the stuff that we think of as Styrofoam, uh, around the same time in the 1930s, a German, uh, company called IP Farbin, who I know we've talked about them before several times.\nThey're the ones who created the gas that was used in the gas chambers.\nAh, okay.\nThey, they've come up a time or two.\nNot, they don't have a great reputation these days.\nNo, I know.\nWe've definitely talked about them a few times, but they, uh, were developing, uh, the EPS, the polystyrene foam, the stuff again that we think of as Styrofoam, uh, like, you know, the cups and the to-go containers and all that stuff.\nAnd both sides, uh, in World War II started saying, \"Hey, this stuff is super light and super insulating.\nUh, works good as a shock absorber.\nUh, we can use it in various parts to make them lighter.\nSo let's get going with it.\"\nYeah.\nThe thing is, I guess it's part of the extrusion process.\nIt essentially is only made in board form, long finish boards, right?\nKind of like it looks like drywall, but it's foam.\nIf you've ever been to a, a do-it-yourself hardware store, and they have like big, big rectangles of foam, that is Styrofoam ver sty.\nIt's, it might not be Styrofoam brand, but it's that exact same thing, right?\nAnd there's not that many uses to it, but the stuff it does do, like, um, block out heat, insulate is another word for it, it does really, really well, right?\nSo the, the XPS is it has like some limited applications.\nThe EPS, the stuff we think of, like, the Styrofoam cups and all that stuff, that has like a limitless applications because you can take that stuff as part of the production process and push it into a mold and mold it into any shape you want.\nAnd they definitely did that in the postwar era of prosperous, um, better living through chemistry.\nUh, that Styrofoam was a big, a big star of that at first.\nYeah.\nAnd you know it, you, you can probably name any sort of, uh, insulation application that it was used for.\nUh, everything from, you know, ice cream, uh, containers, like, you know, when you go to, to taste all the ice cream and then finally settle on one.\nThose big coolers, those are lined with thick Styrofoam.\nUh, they used them for Christmas ornaments because they were super light and won't weigh down a tree.\nRight.\nUh, all kinds again of marine applications, uh, you know, buoys, uh, floating docks in boats, again, you can mold it however you want, uh, but you know, the Styrofoam coolers that you know you pick up at the gas station because you just have a hankering for cold beer and you're on the road, you want to drink and drive smart, just kidding, uh, but those that you see in the convenience store, those started popping up in the 1950s, uh, but we didn't see the cups until the 1960s, right?\nYeah, apparently Chick-fil-A was one of the first, um, restaurants to adopt Styrofoam cups for to-go stuff, right?\nUm, that was in, in 1960, I think.\nYeah, right on the nose from what, the Dart Manufacturing Company of Michigan.\nYeah.\nSo, Dart Manufacturing got into this, and they got into it so heavy that they actually ended up changing their name to Dart Container Corporation.\nAnd they're one of the leading companies or leading producers of what you would consider Styrofoam containers.\nYeah.\nUm, so they were the ones that started producing this, started kind of getting it out there like, \"Hey, you know how you don't like your customers sitting around taking an hour and a half to drink their Coke?\"\nYeah.\n\"Buy one of our Styrofoam cups.\nThey'll just get right out of your hair and somebody else can come in and patronize your restaurant.\"\nRight.\nSo it caught on pretty quick.\nUm, I think 7-Eleven was the first chain to actually start using, um, Styrofoam cups for coffee, which as we'll see was a bad idea right out of the gate.\nYeah.\nUm, and by the '70s, it was like anywhere you went and got coffee, it came in a white, and again, I'm sorry, I realize I keep using the word Styrofoam, you couldn't do any different than I am right now trying to talk about this.\nIt's impossible.\nUm, but they, that, that just became the standard for this whole thing.\nLike a, a, a Styrofoam cup.\nThat's what your coffee came in until Starbucks came along.\nYeah.\nI mean, for decades, basically.\nUh, and then Starbucks did lead the charge to sort of, you know, get rid of that.\nAnd then, you know, a bunch of people followed suit, thankfully.\nUh, but, you know, when fast food came along and takeout food, uh, got more, um, popular, obviously that's going to grow, grow, grow the Styrofoam business.\nUh, I'm, I'm very glad Livia included this, 'cause I would have, if she wouldn't have, and you probably would have too.\nMhm.\nBut if you grew up a kid in the '80s, then you remember the, uh, McDonald's McDLT.\nY, uh, if you don't remember, I think we've mentioned it before, but it was the idea was they're like, \"Hey, no one wants all this hot droopy lettuce and steamy tomatoes on their hamburgers.\nThey want that stuff to be cold, and they want their burger to be hot, and they want to do it like you do at home is you add that stuff right before you put it in your mouth for the right mixture.\"\nAnd that's what the McDLT was.\nThat was not only an offending, uh, Styrofoam container, but it was a double.\nUh, 'cause you had one side that had you keeps the hot stuff hot and the cool side cool.\nThat's right.\nAnd none other than Seinfeld's own Jason Alexander sang and danced in a TV commercial in the '80s extolling the virtues of the McDLT container.\n\n\nitself. Yeah. Wearing a skinny tie. I think he's wearing a blazer with the sleeves rolled up. Even maybe, probably pushed up, like he stinks of 1985. Yeah. The thing about the McD container and yeah. If you don't know what we're talking about, just go look it up. Um, once you took the top off, you could actually sm, like, close the bottoms together and put your sandwich together like that, using your styrofoam container for those who were like really good at it. Yeah. Yeah. See, I don't know. I never ate that because that wasn't my jam, but it seemed like it would just kind of not do a very great job of that. Yeah. No, a McD never passed my lips either because of the L and the T. But I have to say, one of the things that makes me really nostalgic for my childhood is looking at old styrofoam McDonald's containers. Yeah, that it's hard not to just see that yellow container with all the M's all over it. Yeah. And not pine for it, but just, you know, just like nostalgia does. Definitely takes you back. What knocked me out is, as we'll see, it wasn't until 1990 that they stopped using those things. Yeah. Uh, and we'll get to, you know, how it's been sort of weeded out here and there, but it's still a booming industry. I think last year worldwide there were 15.2 million total tons of polystyrene produced. Uh, and about 60% of that is in the Asia-Pacific region. Uh, apparently, um, it's a growing thing, but it's growing much slower in Europe and North America than it is in industrializing areas around the world. Right. Most of it goes in the packing industry. I think a third of it, um, is used by the packaging industry. Those packing peanuts were invented by a guy named Robert E. Holden back in 1965. Household appliances uses another quarter of it. I didn't understand that. I think some of it is packing materials. You know, you have to pull all those boards of styrofoam out of your new refrigerator. Yeah, I think it's also in some of the units, like, like in a washer, aren't there like big chunks of styrofoam? Is it just like air, uh, take up air space? I think that's part of it. And then also, like, in that same fridge, there's like around the dials and controls, they'll use some for insulation. And they don't actually insulate the fridge with it because you can't create an airtight seal between two boards, but they do use it in other places in the fridge where you don't need an airtight seal. Well, I think this is off to a capital start. Mhm. Uh, shall we take a break and um, let you take over? Sure. I think that's a capital idea. All right, we'll be right back.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nStuff You Should Know.\nOkay, Chuck. So, we're back and you said that um, I would be taking over, and since I'm taking over, I'm in charge and I'm delegating it to you.\n[Music]\nI can start this part, but you know when to come in because it's part of, you know, it's chemistry, and that's famously the only class I ever failed. I'm just fascinated by it. So, yeah, this works out just perfectly. That's great. Uh, if we're talking about styrene today, uh, another name for it is vinyl benzene because it is a vinyl, as we'll see. Uh, it does not come from a plant like Eddie Simon used back in Germany in the 1830s. Uh, the modern process is starts with, um, you know, it comes from petroleum products these days, and specifically a couple called benzene and ethylene. Uh, they're combined with a catalyst called aluminum chloride to eventually produce ethylbenzene. You get that in a gas state, process it at a high temperature with another catalyst. It's a process called dehydrogenating. Uh, and finally you have your styrene. Yes, styrene is C8 H8. Lots of carbon, lots of hydrogen together. Yeah. And um, in that styrene molecule, there are carbon atoms that have a double bond between them, right? Which means that they can share one. So when you take styrene, a monomer, and put a bunch of them together to create a polymer, one of those um, double bonds kind of opens up and connects to another one and another one, another one, it forms a carbon chain, right? Mhm. But if you look at the, I don't know what it's called, but like the chemical drawing, you know, of like the molecule with the lines and the C's and the H's and everything. Yeah. I feel like in most movies that's rendered 3D, so you can zoom all zoom it around and stuff, right? This is more like the written out shorthand that I'm talking about. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. I don't know what mine's called, but whatever that is for the um, polystyrene. If you look at it, it's a nice little carbon chain, but then there's these like medallions dangling off of them. Those are called phenyl groups. And because of those things, the polymers can't form a really nice crystalline structure, right? Which means that you could it's see-through. It's not particularly thick. It's brittle, so it can break. And it's not flexible very much, right? Um, and I was like, well, wait a minute. Crystal, you think about is already see-through, but as far as chemistry goes, the more crystalline a structure is, the tighter the whole thing is put together. So, the thicker and less see-through it is. So, like steel is has a very crystalline structure, even though, you know, I think rose quartz when I think of a crystalline structure, but that's wrong, wrong, wrong. Yeah. See, that's why I'm not good at chemistry. It's not very intuitive, is it? I No, but I mean, this is pretty late in life. It's not like I was a chemistry wiz in in high school. I'm not even sure if I took a chemistry class in high school. Oh yeah. Yeah. I got out of a lot of stuff. Never took trig. Um, how'd you get out of that stuff? I I had my ways. Oh, okay. I won't ask any further. So again, if you take the stuff, this polystyrene, you don't have anything that even resembles a foam cup. You have like what looks like a bunch of pellets that if you mash together, you would again create a CD jewel case because that's exactly what they do to create those. You have to go add a couple extra steps to create polystyrene foam. Yeah, exactly. And you know, we said that that stuff was prone to cracking and very breakable if you came about in the CD jewel case era. Uh, red solo cups, too, are also uh, the same thing. But uh, you know, those CD jewel cases if you had one long enough is going to have a crack in it. Oh yeah. Just you had to throw out the entire thing. No, no, no, no. Uh, it was almost a badge of honor. Like, look how long I've had this thing. It's uh, you can't even see through it anymore. It's cracked all over the place. You can't even see Billy Joel's face, right? By the way, well, I think we'll just follow up with the Billy Joel listener mail, but he announced he has a medical condition and he's canceling his tour for now. So, it was very sad to see it. Oh, man. Kind of right after we talked about him. I know. Jinx. Hopefully, he'll be uh, he'll be okay, though. But anyway, I'm sure he will be. Uh, so these XPS boards that we keep talking about, uh, the capital S styrofoam that's used in insulation and stuff like that. Mhm. Uh, how they make that is they melt those little beads that you were talking about, those little granules, uh, add chemicals, one of which is a blowing agent, and then they force that thing through a dye, uh, as in a DI as in like diecast metal type thing, right? And then they're constantly pushing that stuff through and it's melting it and pressing it together. And the final product, those boards of polystyrene are really smooth. They're really thick. They're not very, they just look really uniform. And the reason why is because all of those cells, all those polystyrene foam pellets that you use in a beanbag chair, they get pressed together so tightly with so much pressure and heat that they there's no space between them basically. Okay. With expanded polystyrene, the stuff that you make cups and containers out of, it's it's slightly different. You take those same pellets uh, and like you said, there's a blowing agent in there. Both kinds have a blowing agent, but they use different ones. And the blowing agent is this kind of gas that is put into in little tiny bubbles into the little polystyrene foam pellets. That's what makes it foamy. But if you take those same pellets and you um, expose them to steam, they swell up because that blowing agent suddenly boils and vaporizes at very low temperatures and they the pellets expand to like 40 times their size and they melt together very easily. And what you have now is essentially the raw material for um, expanded polystyrene. That's why they call it expanded, which you can make everything from a coffee cup to uh, vintage Santa Claus door ornament face. Yeah, exactly. Do you remember those? Oh, totally. I mean, that's another nostalgic thing. I think I think you can get them still on like eBay. There's a lot of nostalgia around styrofoam if you kind of really think about it if you're a Gen Xer. But that I mean, that goes to show just how what a huge part it was of 20th century life. It really was. Uh, yeah, for sure. Um, so we mentioned, you know, those boards are really great at insulating. Uh, which is why they use it in like siding sometimes and stuff like that or in ice cream coolers. Uh, one reason is because it is water resistant. Uh, if you have an insulating material that has moisture in it, that's no good because water conducts heat really well, right? So that's one good thing. Uh, but they do degrade over time. Um, the board, you know, that blowing agent will leak out of those cells a little bit over time. So, it's a little less insulating and while it is water resistant, it's not completely water resistant. So, when it does um, not resist a little bit of water, it has a really aka absorption. It has a really hard time getting rid of it again. So, that just kind of knocks it down over time, but even considering depletion, it still has a really good thermal resistance and is still a really good insulator. Yeah, it's like twice as um, twice as good, I guess, than that roll out um, insulation that you can buy. Yeah. And I don't think we mentioned early on, you know, they were they used to put like foot thick cork walls. Yeah. And like industrial refrigerators and stuff and they could get that down to like 2 in of styrofoam. So, it was really useful. I I don't know if we said this too, it's like really, really cheap to manufacture as well. Yeah, super cheap. And so it sounds like just this wonder product that's everything about it is great, but here's where it goes dark. Here's where the VH1 behind the music. It's probably like 35, 40 minutes into the VH1. Mhm. Right before the commercial break, they'll say, and that's when things got dark. Uh, because of course, styrene is dangerous. Uh, if you're just talking about health problems, um, central nervous system problems, headaches, depression, fatigue, um, obviously if you're breathing the stuff in, it's no good. It's no good for your skin and your eyes. And you might think, well, what's the big deal? Because we're not breathing that stuff in. But if you work at one of these places that manufactures it, you totally are. Yeah. And they've followed um, people who work in styrene plants and found that the neurotoxicity makes them kind of dull and a little dippy. Kind of like you're drunk and your reaction times are slower. Uh, and we're talking styrene itself, the monomer that's the basis of polystyrene foam, right? Yeah. Um, it it's been shown to cause birth effects, reproductive defects, um, cancer. Like you said, it's it's it's a bad jam. Polystyrene seems to be not nearly as dangerous. The problem is the way that we make polystyrene, there's still styrene that can break off essentially from the polymer and float around and get into your body and that's that's no good. Yeah. I think they've since the mid 80s they've found uh, styrene and samples of human fat tissue. Uh, of course the uh, public health organizations are saying like they do with everything like that, like no, it's not enough to really worry about it. Everyone's got a little styrene in their fat, right? Uh, don't sweat it. Uh, but in 2018, it was it was bad enough um, as a potential carcinogen that the World Health Organization uh, raised it from possible carcinogen to probable carcinogen. And I imagine it won't be long till they're just like, can we all just admit it's a carcinogen? Yeah, I'm sure that the polystyrene companies are fighting that last tooth and nail. Yeah. So, we should say that most of the um, most of the studies that have shown like styrene is bad for you, like we said, looked at workers who um, who work around styrene, and we don't work around styrene. We're just podcasters. You probably don't work around styrene either. So, like you said, it's not it's not like they're they're not clutching their pearls over this or whatever, but it does seem like this thing where the more that we look at it, the more problems we find from it and the more we come to understand that actually there there's probably more exposure to styrene than we thought. Like if you look across the board, um, everyone will tell you, anyone who knows anything about polystyrene, I should say, will say, \"Do not microwave your polystyrene um, to-go container.\" Yeah. Ever, never. Just don't ever do it because they found that that polystyrene can leech styrene into your food and you eat that stuff. You don't want to do that. And there's even types of containers, polystyrene containers that that have like three little wavy lines and says microwave safe or microwavable or something like that. And\n\n\nthose supposedly you can microwave your food with.\nNo, because what that refers to is the container will survive it.\nIt has nothing to do with whether or not there's going to be chemicals leeching into your food.\nThey're just saying this container won't melt in your mic.\nThat's it.\nSo, never ever ever do that.\nJust take the extra step of dumping it onto a plate for Pete's sake.\nYeah.\nUh for sure.\nAnd you know, especially hot things, especially acidic things like oh, I don't know, hot coffee.\nUh they found that, you know, that stuff can leech into your body as styrene.\nYeah.\nI think they said that it starts leeching out at about 104 degrees Fahrenheit, 40 degrees C.\nNot that hot.\nYeah.\nAnd it's used specifically to keep liquids and foods hot, I guess, or or cold.\nBut, you know, but hot is the problem.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI think it still can leech out when it's even cool or room temperature, but heat is where it really starts to jack up.\nYeah.\nSo, hey, if you get a salad and it's in one of those stupid things, put that in a in a nice ceramic bowl as well, right?\nPut it in a solo cup.\nNo.\nUh there's a bunch of other um impacts that it has specifically environmentally.\nUm should we break?\nAre we going to break?\nOkay.\nI feel like that's a a a third act sort of thing.\nOkay.\nWell, man, I'm glad you caught me cuz I was about to take off.\nAll right.\nYou're grounded.\nWe'll be right back.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nstuff you should know.\nAll right, since I rudely cut Josh off when he was trying to talk about or Joff, that's a new a good new name.\nG E O FF.\nYour favorite spelling of Jeff.\nYeah, I but you have to say it like Joff.\nIf you're gonna go to the trouble of spelling Jeff like Joff, you should say Joff.\nAnyway, I cut off Joff when he started to get hot on the environment.\nAnd uh so I'm going to let you take it away uh because the environmental disaster is basically into three categories, right?\nYeah.\nAir pollution, um threats to marine life, uh and then solid waste.\nThose are the the big three environmental impacts we found that that it it poses.\nYeah.\nUh the air pollution, you might be thinking like, well, I don't I don't get it.\nLike it's just blowing into the air.\nUh it's in the manufacturing process.\nThose blowing agents that we talked about used in making both EPS and XPS.\nThey for decades and decades they were using CFC's, chloro fuorocarbons.\nAnd then everyone's like, &quot;No, we can't use that stuff anymore.&quot;\nSo we stopped using that stuff and they switched over to hydrofluorocarbons.\nMhm.\nUh in this case specifically HFC-134\nLittle A, but that stuff's awful, too.\nYeah.\nIt's a really powerful greenhouse gas that traps heat 1 1430 times more efficiently than carbon dioxide.\nMan, that's a lot.\nThey have they have other stuff that's way worse than that, but that's still not good, especially considering how much Styrofoam is made every year, right?\nYeah, for sure.\nBut so that's a problem with the extruded version.\nApparently the um expanded version, it doesn't have nearly the same problem because it uses a different blowing agent.\nThe best reason I could come up with, and this is all supposition, is that the extruded version keeps its blowing agent trapped into its structure.\nOkay, that makes sense.\nYeah, that's why it uses a different one than the expanded one.\nThe expanded one when its blowing agent vaporizes it creates um I guess essentially pockets that get filled with air.\nSo the blowing agent gets replaced with air.\nSo they use a much less dangerous um or potent greenhouse gas-wise gas.\nUh pentane it's like 10 times more efficient at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\nSo you know big whoop.\nSo the big problem as far as air pollution goes is with the expanded version, the Styrofoam version.\nYeah, for sure.\nUh you mentioned threats to marine life.\nThat's a pretty obvious one.\nUh because it's used so much out there.\nUh buoys again and like any like boogie board or kind of floaty thing that you're using.\nUm floating docks that I mentioned a few times.\nUh fish boxes that hold the fish that you catch when you're out at sea.\nIsn't that the same thing as with that um 1957 ice cooler?\nYeah.\nSometimes it's a good point.\nBut the problem with all this stuff is that when a buoy is floating out there that's made of Styrofoam or there's a floating dock, uh it's not going to stay pristine.\nYou know, it's going to chip away and it's going to degrade and it's going to start to float away in little bitty pieces.\nUm birds are coming coming along and eating that stuff when it's floating on top.\nUm it'll uh get heavier as it goes.\nIt'll attract other organisms that make it, you know, um not floatable, right?\nAnd it will sink and then all of a sudden it's eaten uh in the water and on the bottom of the seafloor by other marine animals.\nYes.\nUm and the reason why it starts to break down like say if it's part of your marina dock is because it's exposed to sunlight and UV radiation of different types break down polystyrene.\nActually can break it down within a few years as a matter of fact when it's exposed to sunlight.\nThe problem is is a bunch of that stuff never gets exposed to sunlight.\nWe throw it away and it gets buried in a landfill, right?\nAnd there are plenty of other, you know, part types of waste that are not great to throw into a landfill, but they're biodegradable.\nAs far as we've known until very recently, Styrofoam is not biodegradable.\nYeah.\nIt's only chemically degradable, and it takes centuries for it to chemically degrade within a landfill.\nAnd because they're so big and bulky, even though they're very light, they're still usually in large shapes, or they can be, they take up a lot of space in those uh landfills.\nSo, they take up a lot of space and they don't break down to to free up space for again centuries, which someone pointed out, I believe, that essentially every um piece of Styrofoam that was ever made is still around in some shape or form on Earth.\nYeah.\nAnd that's not the kind of like staying power that should inspire you.\nRight.\nWell, the thing something that stuck out to me, Chuck, when you said earlier about how um they're derived from petrol prochemicals.\nUhhuh.\nThe fact that styrene is found in um petroleum, petroleum is compressed ancient plant matter, right?\nYeah.\nSo that styrene that was originally in plants is still around millions and millions of years later in the petroleum that we're extracting from the ground.\nThat just goes to show you the kind of staying power that thing has.\nYeah.\nWow.\nThat's incredible.\nYeah.\nUh because of all these problems, of course, there's been uh many movements over the years to to get rid of it.\nUm it depends on the state you live in probably or maybe even the community that you live in, what kinds of bans have been put into place.\nI think uh Berkeley, California, no surprise, and Suffolk County, New York, again, no surprise, were the first uh communities in the 1980s to put a ban in place for this stuff.\nYeah.\nUh 14 different states have enacted uh bans on Styrofoam.\nUm they don't always hold up because you've of course you've got these companies that are going to fight them tooth and nail like you said fight them in court, right?\nUh you've also got city governments and aren't necessarily going to enforce stuff too, right?\nYeah.\nThey tend to be very shy about getting sued especially when their budgets are kind of tight, right?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, if you're a big bad plastic company, apparently Dark Container is is one of the um the more aggressive players in this in lobbying for Styrofoam to stick around.\nUm all you have to do is show up and be like, you know, we would hate to sue you guys into bankruptcy.\nIt seems like a really nice town.\nAnd that city's going to be like, I I don't even remember the Styrofoam ban you're talking about.\nYeah.\nOr we'd hate to close down these warehouses that employ people in your state.\nRight.\nUh which is what they did in Maryland.\nThey uh Maryland banned the foam and uh the Dark Container Company shut down two warehouses there.\nUh employed close to 100 workers and that is how they play that game.\nYeah, they did it in California too in 2024.\nThey put 175 of their workers out of work and they always say, well, it's because of this ban.\nFrom what I understand, these bans don't affect like warehousing or transportation of this stuff within the state or outside of the state.\nIt just seems like it's a vindictive move.\nIt probably helps her bottom line, I would imagine, in some way.\nI I guess I don't know.\nBut from what I from what I understand, the the aggressive lobbying that they engage in, it it I don't know.\nIt seems like I mean, they really want Styrofoam to stick around and they're fighting a tougher and tougher battle each year now.\nYeah.\nI think what I meant was I I I bet they're not uh financially hurting their company by shuttering these warehouses.\nNo, I'm sure not.\nI'm sure not.\nI'm sure if even if they do, it's negligible, you know, to punish a state into submission.\nUh there's also pressure campaigns.\nYou know, McDonald's was one of the early ones uh in the 1980s and I guess uh if they quit it in the 90s, it was kind of fully in the 80s when people like human beings would uh you know protest or just sort of raise a ruckus over this stuff.\nAnd they got together and there were a few tries that like, hey, um, you shouldn't worry about it too much cuz we we do it this way.\nWe only use this much.\nUh, they really wanted to hang on to them, but finally, like you mentioned, in 1990, they said, &quot;All right, we'll use paper.&quot;\nUm, and you know, you should be housing that cheeseburger the second it gets into your car anyway, right?\nYeah, pretty much.\nI mean, just tell them to put it in your hands without even a a paper wrapper.\nYeah.\nI mean, I guess if you're if you got to get it and you can't eat it in your car, you have to carry it somewhere, it's not going to be as hot.\nBut, um I don't know.\nHouse I mean, housing fast food in the car is is a rich tradition that needs to be upheld.\nFor sure.\nEver since there were cars and ever since they were fast food.\nYeah.\nHow else are you going to find uh you know, three-year-old French fries under your car seat when you vacuum it?\nThey look exactly the same as they did the day they got down there.\nThey don't taste quite the same, but they do look like it, don't they?\nYeah.\nSo, um, a lot of people say, &quot;Okay, well, we got all this polystyrene and it does provide a lot of, uh, benefits, even though it seems like the health and environmental benefits are kind of racking up against it.&quot;\nUm, maybe there's something we can do to to recycle it instead.\nAnd, uh, kind of at the outset, you were pointing out just how hard it is to recycle this stuff.\nAnd one reason why it's so hard is because these are big, often times bulky items, especially when you put a bunch of stuff.\nI mean, you can attest if Emily's collecting stuff.\nIt's a nightmare.\nYeah.\nIt It takes up a lot of space.\nEven though it's all light, you could lift all of it with one hand, but it takes up a lot of space, right?\nSo, if you have a truck that is spending a bunch of money on gas to haul recyclables to a recycling center and then they get paid for that load in return,\nthat Styrofoam, I mean, they get paid by the pound.\nSo, that Styrofoam takes up a whole truck, but it does not add up to a lot of money.\nSo, no one wants to haul this stuff.\nThat's one problem.\nAnd that problem also um belies an pro-Styrofoam argument that you'll frequently run into.\nAnd that is that it has a a small carbon footprint because it's so light.\nIt takes so little gas and uh fuel of all kinds to transport it by ocean rail truck.\nThe problem is is you still have that bulky thing.\nSo you actually are probably hiring more transportation to move Styrofoam stuff because yeah, it's light, but it takes up a lot of space in the truck.\nSo I think that that's kind of a um an in disingenuous argument in favor of Styrofoam.\nI think you're probably right.\nUh another problem with recycling it is uh a lot of the foams will have pigments in them.\nThey might be colored or they may have flame retardants uh that make it not as or completely unrecyclable uh along with food contamination.\nUh and then like I mentioned at the beginning just the the cost of this it's it's pretty cheap to make.\nSo there's not a lot of incentives for company to try and uh recycle it.\nUh there's a little more promise in upcycling it by breaking it down into its various chemical constituents, some of which have some pretty high value.\nBut as far as recycling, it just doesn't make a lot of cost-effective sense for a company or a recycling firm, right?\nI was reading a JStore Daily article on this and they they profiled a um a company in Oregon called Agilix and they up uh upcycle Styrofoam into um petroleum again.\nThey turn it back into to crude oil, which can in turn be used for like jet fuel and other like really high quality fuels.\nBut that they're definitely not they're in the minority as far as recycling companies go.\nYeah, for sure.\nUh, another thing, if you're, you know, into helping the environment and recycling and stuff like that, don't don't be fooled just because you see the little uh chasing arrows um recycling symbol because that is on so many things.\nUh, you have to look at the number and then know what that number means.\nUh, and you know, you can look all that stuff up, but uh the ones and twos are are generally um although not entirely consistently recycled, they they have the best chance at being recycled, but something with the number six on it um it's probably not being recycled.\nNo, that's polystyrene's number.\nAnd\n\n\nIt like I mean for all the reasons we just said it, like you said, it's probably not being recycled.\nAnd apparently some environmentalists say that whole chasing arrows um application for the plastics was basically made up by plastic companies to make you feel like right, oh okay, this thing can be recycled.\nI don't I don't have to feel bad about using it for 2 minutes and then throwing it away.\nYeah.\nUm, so there are, like I said, up until very recently, Styrofoam was considered to be nonbiodegradable.\nAnd there are not many things, including plastics, that are not biodegradable, right?\nThey're starting to find that there are some microbes out there that have an ability to break it down.\nApparently, they're found in the guts of meal worms, wax worms, and some kinds of insect larvae, and that these things will feed on Styrofoam, and they will break it down so thoroughly that you could actually eat these worms afterwards.\nThey're it's just metabolized into harmless stuff.\nAnd even the solid waste they excrete, they just keep it in the soil and eat food grown from the soil.\nThe problem is is this is a really new kind of revelation as far as I know and it takes a lot of those things to break down Styrofoam and we're making way more Styrofoam than these worms can possibly handle.\nYeah, for sure.\nUh that the the size of that worm farm would be tremendously large.\nUh but you did find I mean boy you texted me yesterday uh that something can actually melt Styrofoam.\nI'm going to let you say what it is, but my question, my friend, is does that is there an application for that or is that just a factoid?\nIt's just something you can do like if you um I hate packing peanuts and so I've done this before with them, but it's it's a slog.\nSo, probably people aren't going to actually do it, but any organic solvent and in particular acetone, that's the one I've always used, can dissolve Styrofoam into basically nothing.\nUm, you can take an entire bean bag chair worth of pellets and melt it all down into nothingness in a cup of acetone.\nIt's really neat to see.\nAnd oh, just like very slowly adding it in.\nYes.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nLittle by little.\nBut it it doesn't take very long for it to break down.\nIt's not like instantly dissolving, but it's not, you know, days or anything like that either.\nAnd doesn't that create probably some awful thing?\nI mean, you don't want to chase that down out of the solo cup, right?\nNo.\nI still have that mason jar of acetone with Styrofoam in it cuz I have no idea what to do with it now.\nI think you just bury it in the backyard and forget about it.\nI'll just drop it off at a number six recycling center.\nOh, great.\nUh, you got anything else about Styrofoam?\nI got nothing else.\nTry try and avoid it if you can.\nYeah.\nYou know.\nYep.\nUh, since Chuck told you to avoid Styrofoam, obviously everybody, that means it's time for listener mail.\nThat's right.\nPromise to Billy Joel.\nAnd here we go.\nUh from Levi in Hangzu, China uh was giving me a little bit of a break when I when I bagged on uh one of my favorite performer songs, We Didn't Start the Fire.\nHe said, &quot;Chuck, you're in good company because Billy Joel himself has called We Didn't Start the Fire the worst musical thing I've ever written.&quot;\nUh calling out the simplicity of its musical structure.\nUh someone who has only recently gotten into his music, but has personally ranked uh all of his 117 studio recordings.\nWow, you went hard.\nUh, I tend to agree.\nFun song, but it doesn't hold a candle to the rest of the catalog.\nAs for his best and favorite, he's cited uh scenes from an Italian restaurant.\nGreat song.\nAnd you may be right.\nYeah, I know that one.\nGreat song.\nOff of Glass Houses.\nOkay.\nUh, as two of his favorites.\nAnd if Josh hasn't heard Miami 20 uh 2017, the one you mentioned, make sure he starts with the live version from the Songs in the Attic album.\nMiles better than the studio version in my opinion.\nUh, keep repping the piano man.\nAnd that is Levi and Hangzu, China.\nAnd he sent a link to the YouTube of the Howard Stern appearance where Billy Joel called that his worst musical outing.\nAnd he he he was like, &quot;The lyrics are fine.&quot;\nHe said, &quot;I don't hate the song, but he just said musically it's just very simplistic and not my best work.&quot;\nI mean, I think everybody can basically agree that.\nYeah.\nBut, uh, Mr. Joel, we wish you uh, good health and recovery.\nYou got a lot of fans uh thinking about you and your family right now.\nYeah.\nUm that's great, Chuck.\nI think that uh this Billy Joel saga should just continue.\nEvery third, fourth, fifth listener mail should be about Billy Joel, I think.\nI hope so.\nAnd you know, I didn't even mention the deep cuts, so maybe we'll just uh surprise people here and there with those.\nYeah, just pay them out slowly, man.\nPatience.\nYeah.\nUh, if you want to be like Levi and you're in China or anywhere else and want to get in touch with us about Billy Joel or anything else, you can send us an email to stuffodcast@iheartradio.com.\n[Music]\nStuff you should know is a production of iHeart Radio.\nFor more podcasts, iMheart Radio, visit the iHeart Radio app,
