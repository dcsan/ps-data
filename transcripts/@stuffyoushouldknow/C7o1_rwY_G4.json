  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHey, and welcome to the short stuff.\nJosh, Chuck, Jerry, not Dave, but Dave.\nAnd this is short stuff.\nYeah.\nThe one in which we uh continue to lay wood onto Sigmund Freud.\nWhat?\nAs a as a lot of people do.\nYeah.\nI mean, his his spirit at least.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, here's the deal with Sigmund Freud.\nHe uh and I think this this thing that you put together uh from Bratannica and Very Well Mind and Psych Central and simple simply psychology and other places.\nOh yeah.\nUh I think it kind of nails it where like maybe we should just think of Freud as kind of a an innovative um perhaps even great mind and thinker and not like a rigorous scientist.\nUh because a lot of the stuff in his psychoanalysis and in his theories was not it was just stuff based on anecdotal things he saw in the cases he worked on.\nSometimes just like a single case would make him say like oh well here's what this is I think.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean he would just theorize based on conjecture.\nHe never applied the scientific method to any of his theories.\nHe just thought and talked out loud and smoked cigars and he he came up with interesting explanations, right?\nUm for for things he observed for like actual real things.\nAnd one of the actual real things that he observed is that a lot of times little kids are mean and hostile to one parent and can't be separated from the other parent.\nAnd he came to kind of recognize that usually they were attached to the opposite sex parent and were mean to the same sex parent.\nAnd that formed the basis of what came to be known as the Oedipus Complex, which is far and away his most famous theory among a lot of very famous theories that he came up with.\nBut just like all the other ones, it's essentially conjecture.\nYeah.\nI mean, when you think if you know nothing about Freud, you probably have made a joke about like somebody wanting to sleep with their mother.\nYeah.\nI mean, there's a penis even.\nYeah.\nWhat is it?\nI'm not going to tell you.\nSo we should just quickly go over the Greek myth of Oedipus in which that was so named for.\nUh Oedipus was abandoned at birth and then fulfilled a prophecy killing his father the king and marrying his mother the queen whom he did not know uh because he was abandoned at birth.\nThat was his father and his mother.\nHe ended up having four kids with his mother.\nAnd after learning this, uh, Queen Jocasta, uh, hanged herself and Oedipus gouged out his eyes.\nUm, perhaps appropriate action.\nYeah.\nIn in his case, at least.\nYeah.\nSo grossed out he gouged out his own eyes.\nAnd to to be clear to the Greeks, the point of this myth was not like, how gross is this?\nIt was um like it was about how like the inevitability of fate and the inability of humans to like change their fate or their destiny because he was this was a prophecy that he ended up fulfilling despite trying really hard not to.\nRight.\nFreud was like I like that really gross part.\nI'm going to use that to describe these feelings that little kids have toward their parents.\nI like the idea though that someone's writing this myth and they're like, \"Oh boy, I got one for you.\nThis one's so gnarly.\nGnarly.\nWhat What's it about?\nOh, you just wait.\nYeah, I'm not going to tell.\nIt's about It's about destiny.\nUh, whatever.\nSure.\nSure.\nSo, yeah.\nI mean, that's where that's where Freud picked it up was I I mean, it is perfectly suited in that in that sense.\nYeah.\nAnd we'll we'll describe from uh kind of directly from the Simply Psychology website what the edible complex is.\nAnd it occurs during the phallic stage of development ages 3 to six in which the uh source of libido or the life force is concentrated in the erogynous zones of the child's body and during this stage children experience an unconscious feeling of desire for their opposite sex parent and jealousy and envy toward their same sex parent.\nOkay, makes sense.\nIt's a little it's a little jargony.\nUm I also found one from Encyclopedia Britannica.\nIt's a little more lay person geared.\nThey say the Oedipus complex in psychoanalytic theory is a desire for sexual involvement with the parent of the opposite sex and a conccominant sense of rivalry with the parent of the same sex.\nBut it's a crucial stage in the normal development process according to psychoanalytic theory at least.\nYeah, that part is pretty key.\nUh, and what's also key is that Freud based this on a case, uh, one case study of a four-year-old patient, uh, that he anonymized as little Hans.\nUh, apparently little Hans was brought in by his father and had, um, recently seen the collapse of a horse pulling a heavy cart that really traumatized him.\nThat traumatized anybody.\nSure.\nAnd he developed a fear of horses.\nSure.\nSo Hans's father said, \"You know what?\nHe's developed all these really uh specific anxieties.\nUm he feels really uneasy without mom around and he's really fixated on male genitalia, especially horse genitalia.\nAnd Freud was like, \"Yes, yes, I see.\nVery interesting.\"\nYeah.\nUh I'm sorry everybody.\nUh so he basically said, \"This all just makes total sense.\nCheck this out.\"\nHans's father.\nAll of this comes from a foundational animosity that he has towards you, his dad.\nAnd the reason that he's afraid of horses because the horses represent you, his dad.\nAnd he's afraid that you, his dad, are going to castrate him because he secretly wants to sleep with his mother even though he's four years old.\nAnd um Freud's sickopantic secretary jumped to his feet and started applauding uh uncomfortably loudly.\nYeah.\nWhich this you know if you went into a a you know a shrink today and you heard something like this, you'd say, \"Thank you for your time.\nI'll be going to see someone else.\"\nYou could actually probably file suit for something like that.\nYeah, you probably could.\nUh but at the time this turned out to be like the foundational legacy of Freud's psychoanalysis.\nUh, which is just, you know, bananas to think about.\nUh, should we talk about girls first?\nUh, and take a break or a break and then girls.\nUh, let's talk about girls.\nOkay.\nBecause there are such things as girls.\nAnd Freud was like, \"Well, I guess I should probably talk about the girls, too.\"\nHe didn't come up with the name Electra Complex.\nThat was Carl Jung, but he did take the um Ediple Complex and apply it to girls and basically said, \"Same thing, but do the old switcheroo with the parents.\nThe girls want to sleep with their father and they hate their mother.\nUm, but the whole thing is not to do with castration anxiety.\nIt's penis envy in girls.\nThat's right.\nUh, and what I mentioned is the first key.\nAnd by the way, I realized how creepy that sounded when I said let's talk about girls.\nOkay.\nI take it that way.\nOkay, good.\nUh his proposal was and this is very key was that a kid that does not undergo this experience of the Ediple Complex will not fully mature sexually and they will be stuck for life.\nThey're going to be stuck identifying with the opposite sex parent and they will never be able to have a normal socially acceptable uh love life and desires for people who aren't in their family.\nYeah.\nHe he basically said that that an incomplete de development through the edible complex is the basis of homosexuality.\nThat's how he would have put it at the time.\nAnd then the other problem of it is you're stuck in that portion of your development doomed to forever like go through it even though you're never going to go get past it.\nAnd he said that um guys like that turn out to be real Norman Bates types.\nAnd all of his colleagues were like who is Norman Bates?\nAnd Freud was like, \"Just wait.\nJust wait, cuz he's going to knock your socks off when he comes along in the early 60s.\"\nUh, I guess we take our break now.\nYes.\nAll right.\nWe'll be back right after this.\n[Music]\nJust the surface.\n[Music]\nlearning things with you know.\n[Music]\nOkay, Chuck.\nSo, we're back.\nSo, the big question is, is all of this weird gross stuff correct?\nAnswer me.\nWell, uh, most psychologists today and and the the world of psychology as a whole are pretty like um bashful about even talking about this.\nThey're like, can we just kind of forget all that stuff?\nWe've moved on.\nIt's completely discredited.\nUm, most of Freud's theories are pretty discredited at this point.\nBut that's not to say that there isn't some support for this still.\nNo, there have been papers that have come out that seem to very strongly support the the presence of Freud's Oedipus complex.\nAnd one came out in 2009.\nIt was published in the proceedings of the Royal Society B.\nUm and it made international news when it was published because they studied the similarities, the physical characteristic similarities between um men's mothers and their wives.\nAnd they measured everything as as like jaw length.\nThey did everything.\nUm, and they c they they were coming up with correlations in like the 92nd percentile.\nSo essentially like photocopies between mom and wife and they were like, \"See, guys really want their moms.\nWhat you going to do?\nDogs going to hunt?\"\nkind of thing.\nAnd um, like I said, it made international news.\nAnd um, luckily some other scientists were like, \"Let me see your data.\"\nAnd went through and they're like, \"This is this does not support your conclusions at all.\"\nYeah, here's the thing.\nUh, I'm going to go out on a limb.\nHold on to your hats, okay?\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say I've seen plenty of examples where uh kids end up um married to someone that is maybe in some way like like a really good parent that they had of the opposite sex or maybe of the same sex even.\nUm, I don't necessarily think like it's the looks thing, but like if you're like a a really awesome dad and you're like super fun and funny and you know, maybe you have a certain job like and your daughter goes on to marry somebody who has got like a great sense of humor and is maybe have a similar interest as something your father did.\nLike I think that can be a thing.\nI don't think it's always a thing.\nUh but it's just sort of when you're raised with a parent that you look look up to and love and admire, you may seek out people like that in your life.\nAnd I think that's kind of all that is.\nI think similarly and maybe even more frequently or commonly, people inadvertently or unconsciously seek out people who are like their parents in the worst ways.\nYeah.\nOr or sometimes completely seek out the opposite.\nYes.\nBut that's more conscious.\nYeah.\nMaybe so.\nBut yeah, I see what you mean for sure.\nYeah.\nSo again, there have been there was another paper in the 80s that studied rats that basically it said like yes, the these rats at least have edipus complexes that carry on.\nSo luckily psychology came up with some other stuff that says like, okay, kids do stuff like this when they're young, but we don't think it's the Oedipus complex.\nAnd luckily things like attachment theory, which we did an entire episode on that was pretty good.\nYeah.\nhave come along way less creepy.\nWay less creepy.\nThey've come along and and offered pretty good structures for understanding child development that is just much less icky than than Freud's.\nSo, you're just going to summarize that rat study?\nYou're not going to talk about rat ejaculation?\nDo you want me to?\nNo, I think we should just leave that right there.\nOkay, cool.\nSo, I think more than ever short stuff is out.\nStuff You Should Know is a production of iHeartRadio.\nFor more podcasts of iHeart Radio, visit the iHeart Radio app, APPLE
