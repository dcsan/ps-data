  "cleanText": "Hi there friends. Welcome back to the Summer Movie Playlist. This episode is our list of Horror Movies That Changed the Genre. It's from back in 2017, and it's as timely today as it was back then. Horror is probably my favorite genre of all films, and I hope you guys like it too, even if you're not into horror movies. And even if you're not into horror movies, I hope you guys will like this episode, too. It's just that interesting.\n\nWelcome to STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW from howstuffworks.com.\n\nHey, and welcome into the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, Charles W. Chuck Bryant.\n\nHowdy. His middle name is Wayne. My middle name is Malcolm. There we have it. I always forget about that. Malcolm.\n\nYeah, Wayne.\n\nNamed after Wayne Coin, right?\n\nUh, no.\n\nOh, John Wayne, and you were named after Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nThat's right. Frankie Munis is my namesake. I hope he's okay. Early Brian Cranston, too. I used to love that show.\n\nOh, it's a great show. I watched it, um, like within the last couple months. I was cleaning the house and put it on Netflix and still great.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It really is a good show. So, you clean your house, you put on your VR goggles and just queue up Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nYeah. No, I just... You walk around and bump into things and...\n\nRight. Exactly. But I, I put on like a huge feather duster suit.\n\nYeah. So, you're just cleaning and bumping into things.\n\nThat's right. That's how I do it.\n\nWow. Yeah. It works kind of well. Someone's going to take that idea.\n\nYeah. Like the shark native.\n\nYeah. But they should just, they should sell that suit with a purple drink.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nI think you just get one spot on the floor really, really clean.\n\nUh, what are you going to title this one by the way, because this was your pick and we title our own shows episodes.\n\nSome horror films that change the genre.\n\nAll right. And you should add this aka How could you guys forget blank?\n\nYeah. Yeah. We should say like this. First of all, this is a Grabster article. So, it's Grabster's list.\n\nSure. And he knows what he's talking about. If you look at some of the entries, some don't even have source tags.\n\nWhoa.\n\nHe's just like, I just know.\n\nHe should grabster. But we even took his list and carved some out and put some in. Sure. So, this is Josh and Chuck's idea of some horror films that changed the genre featuring the mind of the grabster.\n\nYes. In other words, it is not a complete list of every horror film that changed the genre.\n\nYes. Because I would argue that... Well, and actually, I see Grabster put Texas Chainsaw Massacre in there.\n\nHe said that if this were a top 15 list, that would be in there. So would Alien.\n\nYeah, he has that. Alien, uh, Ringu and the US remake Ring. And I would lobby for, uh, well, Psycho didn't make it onto his list, which, but we're going to put that in. And, uh, there was one more. Oh, even though I didn't really think it was that great. Uh, the movie Saw, I think, kind of changed horror films. And that's what this list is. Not best horror films, but things that kind of changed the game.\n\nYeah, it seems like Saw kind of kicked off that that, uh, torture porn.\n\nYeah, didn't it? I can't remember if it was that or Hostile. One of the two.\n\nWhat a... It was definitely one of the two for a subgenre.\n\nWell, it's pretty accurate actually.\n\nIt is. But most of these are movies that either, uh, were the first of its kind and maybe did start a subgenre or movies that were so popular that they just, you know, kind of rewrote how people view horror movies.\n\nMhm. Uh, some of them because of marketing, some because they were really good movies, some because of box office, but all of these, I don't think anyone could argue, did not change the genre. How about that?\n\nSure. Yeah, I think that's well put, dude. Uh, and before we get started, speaking of horror, I want to give a plug to...\n\nWhoa.\n\nmy friend Toby's movie that's coming out. He's a producer.\n\nYeah.\n\nOn a movie coming out called A Ghost Story.\n\nYeah.\n\nToby, uh, when we met Toby, well, you knew Toby before me, of course, cuz he's your friend. And I know him through Yumi. So, really, he's Yumi's friend. But he was, he was small time doing short films and stuff.\n\nMhm. And since that time, and this has been within the last, like, since we've been doing this podcast.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe's now big time.\n\nYeah. They did Pete's Dragon.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, and then, yeah, they have this, this, they did Ain't Them Body Saints was, I think, the one that they kind of broke out with, which I love that movie. And then this one, um, is definitely kind of falls into that same look and mood and feel, which, uh, it's called A Ghost Story, and I think it comes out in July. And I think it's labeled a drama rather than horror or even supernatural or thriller. Um, but the reason I tie it into horror is because A24 is releasing it, and A24 is killing it with horror movies lately.\n\nYeah, that's a good, uh, that's a good outfit.\n\nThey did The Witch. They did The Black Coat's Daughter. Have you seen that?\n\nUh, no.\n\nIt's on Amazon Prime. It's on Amazon Prime right now.\n\nNodded and gave a thumbs up, dude. It's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. I think The Witch is probably my favorite right now. Yeah. Black Code's Daughter is a close second. And then last night, I saw It Comes at Night in the theater.\n\nUhhuh.\n\nAnd It Comes at Night actually upset my stomach. The ending did.\n\nIt was... It was that rough.\n\nYeah. I think we're, we're at a place with horror movies that we haven't been in a long time. Like a really genuine, good spot.\n\nYeah. Like the whole torture porn sort of era is over and the found footage thing is so played.\n\nOh, man. But I think we, like, with movies like The Witch, I think we've really, like, there are some really creative, uh, uh, It Follows. Did you see that one?\n\nYeah. Like some just really creative ways of bringing scares that I haven't seen before.\n\nGet Out. That was amazing. You see Get Out, man. I still haven't seen it.\n\nYou're going to love it. I, I'm envious of you. It's really... It's a great movie, Chuck. You're going to love it.\n\nWell, I don't get to the movies much anymore. And the only time I could was a couple of weeks ago and I elected to see Wonder Woman.\n\nYeah, not a bad choice.\n\nSo, long way of saying congratulations to Toby and his new film.\n\nWell, that's funny. We also need to congratulate Toby, too, because Toby just got married. Toby and Enell are now married. So, congratulations to them as well.\n\nSo, is this, is this new movie with, uh, his, uh, directing partner David Lowry?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. And Rooney Mara, man, they got a good thing going.\n\nYeah, they, they definitely do. So, it's going to be good. I'm looking forward to it.\n\nAwesome. Okay, so let's get started. Thanks for for indulging that.\n\nThank you, everybody.\n\nSo, the first, the first movie on our list is what's widely considered the first horror movie, and it's a 1920 movie out of Germany that, um, basically was the first film that undertook what's the artistic movement known as German expressionism. Yeah. It's called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\n\nYeah. I mean, some say, like you said, it was the first horror movie. Some say it was the first cult film. Um, it, uh, well, just you may not be able to get through the whole thing if you're not into silent movies, but you should queue up a little bit of it and watch a little bit of it. Um, because it's hugely impactful. Um, and still to this day, like, very disconcerting to look at because of it how, um, ominous and weird it looked.\n\nYeah. Just physically looked.\n\nYeah. Like the sets that they built are obviously, um, constructed, manufactured. They were not in any way, shape, or form going for realism. They were going for surrealism for sure.\n\nYeah. And so, like, the staircases are at crazy weird curves and angles and, um, like everything from the house, the house's rooftops to the blades of grass are super pointy and sharp and, and the shadows that they employed were just perfect. You've never seen a better use of shadows than this. They didn't get in the way. They just created this mood, and it was the first movie to really kind of do that, to just take, to use the camera for something other than capturing realism. Uh, and it, it, it, for that reason, it's considered the first horror movie because that, that's such a standard part of horror, whether large, like in large part, like in a Tim Burton movie or in small part, you know, where you're, um, you're using small spaces to create claustrophobia. The idea of using the set to mess with the viewer's mind, I think, is is born in Dr. Caligari's cabinet.\n\nYeah. It's almost like they, they took a child and gave them construction paper and said, cut out scary things, right? Uh, and then, like, uh, like that movie, The Baba Duke. I think the actual book within The Baba Duke was hugely inspired by this. Uh, the actual movie itself, um, the plot is about a sideshow operator, a hypnotist who, um, has a patient that he takes around to these sideshows with a sleep disorder. Supposedly, he's been asleep his entire life, and he uses this patient to commit murder, right? He's like a sleepwalker.\n\nYeah.\n\nSomnulist.\n\nSo, that in itself is a pretty frightening plot, and to think about that being cooked up in 1920, uh, when there were really not such things that you think of as horror movies is pretty impressive. Mhm. Um, and then some of, like, the deeper critiques I've seen of it was like the, the explanation for why the filmmakers chose, like, these weird odd angles to kind of depict insanity or that kind of thing. Yeah. Um, was rooted in World War I. The horrors of World War I had just been seen and revealed and recently taken place and it upended Europe in general and especially Germany as well. Um, and that the idea is that they, they might not have had this idea. They might not have had this desire, this drive to create this, this weird set, and in fact, this weird movie had World War I not happened.\n\nYeah. This, uh, there's this writer, Jeff Saparito, who, um, kind of put it this way about German expressionism, because I wasn't exactly sure how to define it. Uh, but you're kind of right on the money. He said Germany was, uh, largely isolated from the rest of the world following, uh, World War I. So, expressionism therefore became confined to the country refers to a number of creative movements from World War I through the 1920s. Uh, expressionist works examine the, uh, current and future state of the culture through bold and artistic creations of creativity and often explored topics of madness, betrayal, and other intellectual concepts. And nothing encapsulates these ideas more than The Cabinet of Dr. Caligotti.\n\nThat's basically what I said.\n\nYeah. You did, you read that or were you just, uh, that...\n\nI don't know if I read that, that one or not. It sounded kind of familiar.\n\nYeah. No, just say you came up with it.\n\nUm, so there, the idea of the, the set just creating like a creepy tone and texture to everything. Um, that was Dr. Caligari. That's how it changed the genre.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Tim Burton say thank you.\n\nYeah. You, um, have you seen Coraline?\n\nNo, but I know it.\n\nIt's a... They, they did that to very good effect.\n\nYou know, I think Hodman does a voice in that, doesn't he?\n\nHe does. He does the dad. He did a spectacular job because you actually forget it's Hajman while you're watching it.\n\nThat's impossible.\n\nAll right, Chuck, moving on. That was 1920. We're going to fast forward all the way to what? 1960?\n\n1963. If you're talking about Blood Feast. Well, I wasn't, but let's...\n\nUh, Simon, uh, Simon Abrams of Roger Ebert.com says this. Bloodfast is a terrible film.\n\nMhm.\n\nAnd a historically important one, too.\n\nYep. And I think that's sort of the deal with Blood Feast. It is not good by any accounts. Did you watch any of it?\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nIt's not good.\n\nNo, it's not good. It's terrible. Uh, it was written on basis on a 14-page outline. Didn't even have a script. It's got the same cloying technicolor of like a early Hawaii 50 episode.\n\nYeah, for sure. Uh, directed by Hershel Gordon Lewis and producer David F. Friedman. And, uh, basically the idea was this. These guys did not see films as art. They saw them as a business and thought you were foolish if you thought it was anything else. So, they sat around, they brainstormed movies that they thought no one else would make.\n\nYeah. Because they started out making like porkiesesque type movies.\n\nYeah. And they were, they were doing fine with that, but apparently they were successful enough with it that there started to be imitators and the market was crowded. So, they said, \"Where can we go make movies that no one else is going to make?\"\n\nYeah. Cuz we want to shock people essentially. So, a couple of ideas they had that did not make the list was con man evangelist and Nazi torture, which, uh...\n\nWhich were later made. Exactly. And they finally said, \"You know what? No one's really done yet is hardcore gore.\"\n\nYep. Like everyone always cuts away when the knife comes. And you're like, \"What if we showed the, the grossest, goriest stuff imaginable on screen?\"\n\nYeah. And even still, they didn't show, so, like, one of the, the first murder, a woman stabbed through the eye and then the murderer hacked her legs off with a machete, right? And they didn't show the knife penetrate the eye. They didn't show the machete making contact...\n\n\nWith the skin.\nBut what they did in Blood Feast and what made Blood Feast the first of its kind was they would show the what came after that.\nThey would show the brains on the ground.\nThey would show the endtrails like on the knife.\nUm, they would show the leg being, you know, that had been dismembered being put into a bag and like the wound that was left by it.\nYeah, like that.\nThis was to No one had ever done anything like that on film before.\nNo.\nAnd and it paid off.\nThey um depending on who you ask, the the budget was uh anywhere from like 20 to 30 grand and it made between 7 and $30 million.\nUh, like I said, depending on where you get your info, but by all accounts, it was a huge financial success.\nYeah.\nUh, compared to what they paid to make it.\nYeah.\nAnd they they shot it in um I think it was six days or something down in Miami.\nYeah.\nUm, based on a 14-page outline that wasn't even a script, it was an outline.\nBasically, it was like murderer goes and kills this girl.\nYeah.\nNext girl, murderer comes in, kills girl, cuts off leg, that kind of thing, right?\nYeah.\nI mean, if it matters, the movie is about a serial killer caterer.\nYeah.\nThat's it.\nThere's your plot right there.\nYep.\nUm, but the the it was just such a a revolutionary movie that the sensors at the time there wasn't such a thing as the MPAA hadn't been formed yet.\nUm, and there was basically no one except for local sensors overseeing movies.\nYeah.\nSo you know you you could be playing in one town um to all audiences and then the next town over it could be banned.\nBut the sensors had never seen anything like it and they didn't know what to do with it.\nSo yeah, it it it was hugely successful commercially too.\nYeah.\nAnd uh another big impact it had was it inspired a generation of special effects, but basically um let's be honest, young boys who were doing this on their own Super Eight films, right?\nAnd said, &quot;Wait, uh I can get a job doing this.&quot;\nYep.\nSo, including Tom Cevini, I think, was inspired by it, wasn't he?\nOr was he inspired by Yeah, I think he was inspired by Blood Feast.\nOh, wow.\nUm, and then we should also give a a mention to the Grand Gun.\nIs that how you think it's pronounced?\nSure.\nGranuin.\nSure.\nUh, it was a theater in Paris, I believe.\nFrom the late 19th century on to, I think, 1962.\nSo, the year before Blood Feast came out, it had closed up, but it used to do this stuff on stage.\nIt was like a gorefest.\nUm, and there was lots of like blood and sex and and like depraved themes in the plays that were put on at this theater.\nPeople loved it.\nThey were crazy for it.\nUm, and the this was kind of like the Grand Go tradition put onto film for the first time.\nAnd who for that?\nYou want to take a break?\nYeah, let's do it.\n[Music]\n[Music]\nAll right, Charles, we're back.\nSo, 1960 or 1968?\nUh, I've got 1968 in front of my face.\nOkay.\nUh, and that could be no other movie than Night of the Living Dead.\nClassic George Romero film.\nUh, Romero was a TV director making TV commercials.\nCommercial director rather.\nHe was also making short films for Mr. Rogers Neighborhood at the time.\nYeah.\nAnd he was he was young.\nYeah.\nI don't I don't know how old he was, but he was pretty young guy still.\n196 I think when he made shot of the Living Dead, he was like 26 or 27.\nWow.\nSo, uh yeah, by any standard, that's still pretty young unless you're 23.\nSo he I he had um he and his buddies were like, &quot;Let's make a horror movie, but let's not make a stupid horror movie.\nLet's make one with like an actual plot that explores like deep themes to like a good movie.\nLet's let's make the first good horror movie.&quot;\nWell, yeah.\nSo, and we'll delve into that a little more, but that that was definitely a different thing at the time.\nAnd the other different thing was that all the horror movies up to that point, uh they were called the Universal Monsters from Universal Studios.\nYou know, all the the kind of the classic Frankenstein and Dracula and Creature from the Black Lagoon and the Werewolf and uh that was where that was mainstream horror.\nAnd George Romero comes along and says, &quot;Um, how about zombies?&quot;\nAnd everyone said, &quot;What in the world's a zombie?&quot;\nAnd he said, &quot;Well, let me define that for every future generation of movie and TV goers and lovers.&quot;\nYeah.\nAnd there had been zombie movies before, but they had been things like like Dr. Caligari's cabinet, somebody who was under the control of something someone else or something like that.\nThere was a hypnotist or this was like the the first time what we think of as zombies were ever introduced.\nLike flesh-eating ghouls who were dead and come back to life.\nYeah.\nJust what you think of as a zombie.\nThis guy started that genre.\nLike you said.\nYeah, they uh shot it outside and in Pittsburgh uh on about $115,000 budget.\nNot bad.\nEnded up grossing 12 million domestic.\nNot bad.\nAnd I think close to 20 worldwide.\nAnd um was eventually selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nIt's a good movie.\nIt it's a very good movie.\nUh, they shot it in black and white to save on cost even though color was the standard by that point.\nAnd uh black and white is also a little more forgiving for rudimentary special effects.\nAnd uh one of the revolutionary things he did was uh cast a black actor as the lead and for no other reason than hey this guy Dwayne Jones is really good.\nExactly right.\nLike he didn't go back and go, &quot;Oh, well, you know, our our hero is black, so we need to make the the whole thing a meditation on race and have him confront racism.&quot;\nIt it was just here's the script and then the guy playing the lead just happens to be black, right?\nAnd he was the best guy in the auditions and you know in 1968 this didn't really happen.\nYou didn't just cast a black guy as a lead actor for no with no like ulterior motive basically.\nRight.\nSo I read this review from the from the time from 1969 the year after it came out.\nA young Roger Eert went and watched it and wrote a review and he wrote um a a pretty pretty interesting review which is basically it was about the reaction of the audience and he went to a Saturday matinea that was populated almost entirely by 10 11 year olds.\nOh wow.\nAnd they were used to seeing the creature from the Black Lagoon or Frankenstein or um you know just just movies that any kid could handle and could enjoy watching and you know fun scary kind of stuff.\nYeah.\nAnd he said that's how the that that was how the crowd reacted for the first half of the movie.\nBut then about the point where and here's here comes spoilers everybody.\nIf you haven't seen Night of the Living Dead, just hit yourself in the knee with a hammer.\nUm, you the the the teenage couple go to get gas and when their car blows up and is engulfed in flames, they die.\nThey're burned to death.\nHe said, &quot;Right about that time, the tone, the mood of the theater changed and there was no like gleeful screaming anymore.\nKids were starting to like not move and were afraid to like move in their seats and some were quietly crying to themselves and from that the whole the whole point on it just got worse and worse for these little kids watching this movie.\nSo it was a huge uh impact on horror movies.\nA it uh like you said earlier, it was kind of the first one to really sort of delve into other issues like if if you look up like significance of Night of the Living Dead or um meaning of Night of the Living Dead or something like that.\nThere are scores of articles that have been written over the years of how it was a metaphor for the Vietnam War or an allegory about distrust of authority or the collapse of traditional family.\nAnd I think Romero said like I didn't necessarily mean all these things, but you can certainly find it in the movie.\nThat is art.\nLike one of the great revelations of my adult life is that the artist, the writer, the songwriter, the um the author rarely intends to imbue as much meaning into their work as people take from it.\nThat that's part of art as interpretation.\nIsn't that neat?\nYeah.\nLike you don't if you're a writer, if you're a young writer right now who's just sitting there racking your brain for how to insert metaphor and and meaning into this, just write your story and people are going to find it for themselves.\nYeah, agreed.\nI wish somebody had told me that when I was younger.\nI had teachers that said stuff like that.\nOh, I didn't.\nLike good college uh professors in English that would when students would argue like I think he means this he would say like you know he may or she may not have meant anything right I had that's the revelation I had teachers that would just go wrong uh the other thing about Night of the Living Dead is it spawned um obviously the the zombie genre and uh sequels Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead, uh The Walking Dead remakes like shout out shout out Steven Yun.\nYeah, right.\nWhy not?\nI'm still into The Walking Dead.\nYou Yeah, we talked about this.\nYes.\nYes.\nOkay.\nSteven Yun listens.\nUh anyway, zombies are I think still hot and we can so hot.\nWe We owe that all to Mr. Romero, master of the genre.\nYep.\nChuck, one more thing too that that Night of Living Dead did that they weren't the first, but very famously Romero did was kill off his hero senselessly and shockingly.\nYeah.\nAt the end.\nGood point.\nThanks, man.\nOkay, so let's move on.\nLike I said, 1973.\nYes.\nDay after Christmas.\nIf you've ever been uh in Washington DC at the end of M Street, you might have noticed a very uh during the daytime ordinary set of stairs.\nAt night time, maybe they look creepy to you because those are the exorcist stairs.\nYeah, I'm trying to conjure the music in my head, but all I'm coming up with is the Unsolved Mysteries music.\nIt's not quite right.\nSo close, but it's not it.\nI'm so unsatisfied right now.\nSo, The Exorcist was uh based on a book by William Peter Blatty who uh wrote this uh in 1971 and then in 73 the movie was made.\nUh, and there's I think I referenced not too long ago a great Mark Marin interview with um William Friedken.\nMhm.\nWhere he talks about the audition process for Linda Blair.\nSo, you should go listen to that because it was pretty insightful.\nBut um The Exorcist really kind of changed the game.\nUm, in that it was a it spawned a bit of a subgenre of um demonic movies.\nSure.\nThat were like religious based.\nYeah.\nEven though I guess Rosemary's Baby was before that, but The Exorcist was such a mega hit and it was nominated for best picture, the first horror movie to be nominated um for for that.\nSo, it was just like it was a big deal.\nIt was It sold six million tickets in about two months.\nYeah.\nIt's amazing.\nThis is a horror movie, right?\nAnd it came out of nowhere.\nUm, apparently the effect it had on audiences was extremely pronounced.\nThere was a woman in Boston who had to be carried from the theater.\nAnd she goes, &quot;It cost me $4, but I only lasted 20 minutes.&quot;\nSo word like that's the stories of that got around and and people wanted to see you know this movie can't be that scary and they went and they were like oh my god that movie is that scary.\nYeah and it holds up too.\nI mean um special effects are they'd never quite hold up but it's still a very creepy movie.\nUm, very famously, uh, Linda Blair played the the little girl who was possessed by a demon and, uh, the the the the heavy hitters were called in, right, to exercise this demon, including, um, a Max Van Seed, who was only 44 when he played this guy in his easily in his 70s.\nYeah.\nWas he Benjamin Button?\nWell, no, they they made him up.\nWow.\nThey did a great job.\nYeah.\nWhich I don't see why they felt the need to do that.\nI know they um God, who else did they almost cast?\nOh, uh Brando.\nThey almost cast Brando, but that would have been a colossal mistake.\nWell, Freriedin said, &quot;You know what?\nAs soon as you do that, it's a Marlon Brando movie.&quot;\nYeah.\nAnd I think he said picture.\nA Brando picture.\nSure.\nThat's what they said.\nUh and he didn't want it to be a Brando picture.\nHe wanted to be The Exorcist.\nUm, so the the you said it was based on a book from two years before by William Peter Blatty.\nHe he apparently was known as a a comedy writer and he wanted to do something different.\nHe said, &quot;Hey, wouldn't it be funny if the little girl's head spun around and she puked green bile?&quot;\nWait, what will you hear what I have her do with a crucifix?\nHey, so um, he actually wrote the book because he wanted to scare America back to church.\nThat was his aim with the book.\nIt may have worked.\nHe he believed that there was real evil going on in the world and that part of it was because of a a loss of faith or a loss of religion, I guess.\nAnd that's what he wanted to do with it.\nUm, and when the movie came out, there was a huge push back from religious authorities.\nLike Billy Graham said he believed the movie itself was possessed by a demon.\nI'm not sure how that would happen, but that was like a huge thing at the time.\nUm, and a lot of a lot of other um, religious establishment types were like, &quot;Don't go see that movie.\nIt's evil.&quot;\nBut there were some who who were part of part of religion, major organized religion, who kind of saw through it and said, &quot;No, no, this is\n\n\nIt's good that we're talking about this, that there we're telling people, you know, or people are seeing that there there's such a thing as like good versus evil literally combating on earth, you know, and people are talking about this and thinking about it.&quot; And so in that sense, The Exorcist like really kind of went to bat for organized religion.\nOh, interesting.\nI saw another um criticism of it though that that said one of the themes of the movie that the book hadn't really intended, but the movie picked up on and expounded on was intergenerational conflict. That it was Reagan, the child, represented the younger generation who was at war with the establishment, and that it even goes um so far as to where her mother, the actress, the movie that she's working on is about a campus takeover by young radicals.\nHuh.\nSo that that's kind of a theme that was apparently part of the subtext, but was a major part of it in the movie at least.\nInteresting.\nYeah, I thought so too because apparently I mean you think of intergenerational conflict now. Apparently in the late 60s and early 70s it was sharper than it probably ever has been before or since.\nYeah.\nMhm.\nThe only other thing I got is that the uh the green stuff that she projectiles was uh Anderson's pea soup and a little bit of oatmeal texture.\nAnderson's pea soup.\nI bet you can't get that anymore.\nChuck, let's do Jaws and then we'll take a break.\nI love talking about Jaws.\nYeah, I mean Jaws is on, you know, I did my top favorite movies list uh at one point on our website and I listed Jaws as my favorite movie.\nFavorite of all time.\nYeah, I mean that list changes, but it's Jaws is always in my top five.\nI can watch it anytime it's on.\nUh it is one of the I've I've often said it's a perfect movie.\nUm, and what I mean by that is there's just not a misstep.\nLike the casting was perfect, the acting was great, the script was great, it played out just perfectly throughout the film.\nUm, he like Spielberg was just a master storyteller with that movie.\nYou were talking about how young George Romero was in Night of the Living Dead.\nSpielberg was 26 when he made Jaws.\nHe was 13 years old, right?\nHe uh and he was apparently scared to death when he finished filming.\nUh the schedule had been for 55 days.\nIt went to 159.\nYeah.\nHis he had I think been allotted $4 million.\nHe ended up spending $12 million on it.\nUm yeah, largely because a shooting on water is notoriously difficult and b uh the shark mechanical shark they use was uh legendarily um wonky and how it or not wonky but wanky wonky.\nIt didn't work.\nNo, it rarely worked.\nSo they spent a lot of time and burnt a lot of uh hours trying to get this shark to do its thing, and uh so much so that it didn't even make that many appearances in the movie.\nI think they even kind of scaled it back and that ended up being better for the movie because you didn't get as much shark.\nI looked up the um the urban legend about the shark being named after Spielberg's lawyer, Bruce, and apparently it's true.\nOh, really?\nYeah.\nBruce Rener was the name of Spielberg's lawyer and that was the nickname for the mechanical shark on the set was Bruce.\nThat's pretty funny.\nSo with Jaws, right, we're we're talking about Horror Movies that changed the Genre.\nJaws not only changed the horror genre, it changed movie making to this day.\nYeah.\nIn in multiple ways, multiple massive ways.\nIt it changed the entire film industry almost single-handedly.\nYeah.\nIt was uh at the time there was a uh there was no such thing.\nYou take it for granted now, but there was no such thing as a quote unquote summer release.\nNo.\nA lot of theaters closed down because AC wasn't in every theater and people didn't want to sit around in a hot movie theater for two hours.\nYeah.\nA summer release or a a tentpole film or a blockbuster feature like Jaws was the first one of all those.\nWhat at the time when Jaws came out, they used to um release a movie on maybe one, two screens in say New York or LA for a week and then it'd make its way to, you know, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Chicago for a few weeks and then eventually it'd make it to your small town six, eight weeks later.\nYeah, that was how movies were released.\nNot Jaws.\nJaws was released on 435 screens across the country, which was huge, which is part of the part of the um summer blockbuster release playbook now.\nYeah.\nAnd it was also the first movie to to spend lots and lots of money on marketing.\nUm and so I think the studios are like, &quot;Wait a minute, you spend some dough on marketing, you release this thing wide, you can make a ton of money in the first month that a movie's out.&quot;\nMhm.\nAnd you're kind of set.\nLike after that, it's anything else is gravy.\nYeah.\nAnd that's after the first like week or two probably.\nYeah, it was.\nYeah.\nThe whole the whole point of Blockbuster now is to get that opening weekend to make all your money back in the opening weekend and then everything else is gravy on top of it, right?\nJaws was it didn't make its I don't know, maybe it did make its money back in the first weekend because it it hit a hundred million in like 78 days or something incredible like that because it was the first movie to hit $100 million and it did it in just a couple months even.\nYeah, it eventually went on to make uh to about $260 million domestically.\nUh which is I mean that's a great take now.\nYeah.\nYou know, much less uh the mid 1970s.\nSure.\nFor a $12 million spin, for sure.\nMy only beef here is that I would not consider Jaws a horror movie.\nYeah.\nI think it's an adventure film.\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nWith a scary antagonist.\nYeah.\nBut um it's amazing how much I quote that movie in my day-to-day life.\nYeah.\nA shark.\nThat's a great that's a classic.\nAll right, let's take a break.\nI'm going to meditate on that line and we'll talk about uh a few other scary movies, including one that was originally titled Scary Movie.\n[Music]\n[Music]\nOkay, moving on to Halloween.\nHalloween, Chuck.\n1978, I believe.\nHalloween.\nYes.\nJohn Carpenter.\nUh, the youngish John Carpenter.\nMhm.\nWho originally titled this movie The Babysitter Murders.\nNo.\nLittle on the nose.\nYeah.\nBut pretty terrifying title, I guess.\nUh, young Jamie Lee Curtis, her very first movie.\nWas it really?\nYeah.\nWell, she went on to become known as the Scream Queen for all the horror movies she was in.\nTotally.\nAnd this was uh shot in 20 days in uh South Pasadena as the Midwest.\nAnd um it was it's credited as being birthing the slasher genre.\nYeah, it did.\nSo, there were slasher films before it.\nThe Town That Dreaded Sundown.\nGood movie.\nIt's like based on a true crime story actually in Texas.\nOne called Black Christmas, the Grabster Sites from 1974.\nHaven't heard of that one, but the idea of um of a faceless almost a like non-entity entity coming at you uh and relentlessly stalking you, being impervious to harm as the Gripster puts it.\nUm and just coming at you again and again trying to kill you.\nThat that was that was all established by Halloween and it was done like to to great effect as well.\nYeah.\nAnd it holds up.\nIt's still scary.\nUh Michael Myers of course was the killer.\nUm the the music that John Carpenter score I mean he he scores most of his movies himself but um very iconic uh basic thing.\nI think he only took a couple of days to come up with it, but like the Michael Myers character and the mask are so iconic.\nThe music is so iconic.\nYou know about the mask, right, Shatner?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nGo ahead.\nI went and checked that one out, too, to verify that it was true.\nAnd it definitely is true that the Michael Myers mask is actually a Captain Kirk Star Trek mask painted white.\nYep.\nThat is history.\nYep.\nIn the in the script uh when it came to the mask, it just said uh pale neutral features of a man.\nYeah.\nWhich makes the whole thing even creepier because he's a implacid or a uh is that the right word?\nI don't know.\nHe's just it's just almost like a just an emotionless killer.\nOh yeah.\nIt it made the fact that he was merciless, ruthless, pitiless, and and arbitrarily killing people almost um all the more pronounced because his expression never changes.\nWell, to me, the two things that were creepiest about Halloween was the expression never changed because of that mask and he did not run like Oh, yeah.\nHe would just walk and you still got the feeling like you can't outrun this guy even though he's walking.\nThat was another creepy part about it.\nIt follows was the walking aspect of it.\nOh yeah, for sure.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIn the same way that like 28 Days Later was freaky in that it took zombies and made them run.\nYeah.\nOr I remember when I saw uh Friday the 13th, I'm sorry, uh Nightmare on Elm Street for the first time and Freddy Krueger was running around, I was like, that's not what scary dudes do.\nYeah, scary dudes don't trot.\nNo, they they walk very creepily toward you and still somehow gain speed on you even though you're running full speed.\nWell, Freddy scared me to death the first time I saw that movie.\nYeah.\nNo, first one was a pretty good one.\nBut Halloween established the like you said, it established the slasher genre and everything about slasher films still today all rooted in in Halloween, John Carpenters's tropes.\nYeah.\nAnd again, like you said, there were a couple of other slasher films before, but none of them grossed close to 50 million bucks.\nWow.\nIs that how much Halloween made?\nYeah.\n47 million domestic at about a $300,000 budget.\nSo, it uh you know, it's sort of like with The Exorcist, like there were other movies that sort of did this thing before, but when you have a huge hit that does it is when it sort of redefineses the genre because it makes money.\nYeah.\nAnd that's all that matters.\nEverybody Everyone starts paying attention after that.\nAll right.\nWhat's next?\nWhat's next, my friend, is a movie that came out when I don't know.\nWere you still in college?\nUh, no.\nYou must have just been out then.\nI was out a few years.\nOkay.\nWell, regardless, around our college era, this movie came out because up to this point, everything's come out either when we were little or before we were born.\nThis one was right in our wheelhouse.\nIt was The Blair Witch Project, which came out in 1998.\nYeah.\nAnd uh one of the big things that um Blair Witch Project did, well two things really.\nIt established the found footage uh genre or subg genre that is so overplayed now.\nMhm.\nUh and the viral marketing campaign and that's how I came upon it.\nI remember very specifically uh being in the apartment of Scott Epelo who you know.\nSure.\nHe shot our TV show.\nOne of my oldest friends and I was sitting in his apartment on Claremont Avenue uh in Decar and I happened upon this and this was pref Facebook.\nI don't even know how I found it, you know, before things were being shared around, right?\nAnd I happened upon this website, the very first Blair Witch Project website, and I was like, &quot;Dude, come over here and check this out.\nThis is the scariest thing I've ever seen.&quot;\nYeah.\nAnd I remember the the the website set it up as if it was real.\nAnd that this found footage thing, it's so overdone now, it's hard to go back in time and remember when it was fresh.\nBut I remember looking at it and being like, did this happen?\nDid they really find this footage of this murder in the woods?\nLike, I got to see this.\nThat was the rumor that this was actually real, man.\nAnd this was, like you said, I mean, this is before the found footage genre.\nSo, people were being exposed to this concept for the first time and were kind of falling for it.\nI mean, first of all, you're you're either in college or you're just recently out of college, so you're maybe slightly more gullible than you are 10 years on.\nYou're ready to believe it.\nYou want to believe, right?\nSo, yeah, the idea that this was actual found footage, it just made it all the more enjoyable and people were buying into it.\nThen I think the other part of it too was that the filmmakers partly because they didn't have the budget for actual effects left a lot of the the the scariest parts to your imagination.\nYeah.\nNor did they have the talent to make a good narrative film.\nI guess I mean they worked on a 64page script which I was surprised that it was that that big but they shot it for eight days and originally they were going to make it like a documentary about the found footage right and then one of them had a flash of of perspective and was like wait wait wait wait let's just release it like it's found footage and that was that the rest was history.\nYeah and I'm poking fun that was not very nice at all.\nUm Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel uh Merrick or Merrick the co-directors they they should be credited with a truly ingenious uh campaign and invention that well they weren't the first to come up with found footage right there were some films before um I've never known how to pronounce it Mondo Kane or Mondo Kaine I think Kane it's from 1962 and it was supposedly a documentary about um like some some like weird tribal rituals.\nI think there's hedge shrinking maybe involved and it purported to be like real footage.\nYeah.\nSame with Cannibal Holocaust, which if you've never seen Cannibal Holocaust, go out and watch it right now.\nIt's very disturbing.\nUm and it's so disturbing that the director of the movie was charged with murder because they believed that the the actual murders depicted they were so realistic.\nThey thought that it was a snuff film basically, but it was supposed to be a documentary as well.\nSo, there was an idea of like found foot\n\n\nAge or documentary style horror movies that had come before, but nothing like the Blair Witch, where it was just straight up these people. We found their old camera, and this is what was on it.\nWell, and they were smart enough to kind of dig up an old thing that never went huge, you know? And they're like, \"Hey, man.\" Like these other movies, they never really hit it big. It was a timing thing. They, they, uh, I mean, hats off for them, to them.\nYeah.\nGood for them, and to them.\nNice going, dudes.\nAll right, Chuck. Scream.\nYeah, Scream. I teased that it was originally titled Scary Movie.\nI'm glad it wasn't because Scary Movie is awesome. I don't know what Scary Movie ever would have been called. Maybe it would have never been made, or maybe they would have called that Scream.\nOh, yeah. I guess so.\nSo, uh, Scream was a very big deal when it came out. Uh, the writer, Kevin Williamson. Um, and this is still the highest-grossing slasher film of all time. Basically, Scream one is. It was huge. I got Nev Campbell's haircut as a result of it. Like, it was a big, big pop culture watermark.\nIt was. And one of the big things about it, aside from the boatloads of money that it made, uh, was it spawned a subgenre called metahor, which is, um, even though it had been done by no less than its own director, Wes Craven.\nYeah.\nWith West Craven's New Nightmare, uh, two years before Scream, it wasn't nearly as popular. But metahor is this idea, if you've ever seen Scream, you know they're constantly just referencing horror movies, like this is where you know you don't go out and make out in the car because that's where you get killed, and then they would do that and get killed, right?\nAlthough I don't think that specific thing happened.\nLike, don't go back in the house.\nYeah. Like all the tropes of horror movies are addressed in the movie, and they're talking about them as the horror movie tropes.\nYes.\nYeah. Exactly. Metahor.\nYeah. And there were plenty of other things that came along. Meta metahor, um, examples like, have you seen Tucker and Dale versus Evil?\nUh, no.\nIt's a good...\nOh, check it out, man.\nAll right. That's a good movie. Um, Zombieland.\nYeah, I did see that.\nUh, where he's rattling off all of the things that you need to know to survive a zombie apocalypse that he learned from zombie movies, right?\nAnd then Cabin in the Woods. Did you see that one?\nGreat movie.\nIt was a great movie. I thought it was really good. I mean, from beginning to end, it was a great movie.\nDid you like Scream?\nYeah, love Scream. I liked all the Screams.\nI only saw the first two. The second one, I think, might have been even better than the first.\nUh, maybe, to me. And that the second one was shot... Emily worked on that. It was shot here in at Agnes Scott College partially.\nOh, is that right?\nYeah.\nHuh. I'll have to go back and watch it knowing that now. I'll be like, \"Oh, I've driven past that place.\"\nUh, so I got a few tidbits. Uh, like I said, initial title was Scary Movie. Um, number two, the Weinstein Brothers initially offered it to George Romero and Sam Raimi. Um, what else do I have here? Drew Barrymore was originally supposed to play Sydney, the lead character, and then she said, \"No, how about if I just play that girl at the beginning,\" which kind of was a big thing because you see Drew Barrymore, and it was a big shock when she died in the first scene, right?\nYou know, you can't kill off your heroine right away.\nYeah. And like, I remember, I remember that first scene really, really scaring me when I saw it the first time in the theater.\nYeah, it is. It's a scary, gruesome, gory part.\nYeah. Very well played. Uh, and then before he went to, um, Nev Campbell, he went out to Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, and Reese Witherspoon. And then Nev Campbell Camp.\nThat was your first choice, right?\nUh, and then the mask, the iconic, uh, Scream mask, apparently was an off-the-shelf mask.\nWow. That made that company's money.\nYeah. And the Weinstein didn't like it. They were like, \"I, I hate that mask. Everything else is fine.\"\nHuh.\nBut Wes Craven said, \"No, it's got to be that mask.\"\nDon't be stupid, Bob.\nAll right, we're going to finish up with our own edition here.\nFinally, 1960.\nYes.\nPsycho.\nI can't believe this wasn't on the list.\nI think Ed kept this off the list to toy with somebody he doesn't like specifically. That's the only explanation. Yeah, because Psycho changed everything.\nYeah, it really did. I mean, it was the... You could say that it was one of the first slasher flicks. It was a early psychological thriller.\nYeah.\nUm, it was based on the real-life story of Ed Gein.\nYeah. I mean, it doesn't exactly mirror Ed Gein's life, but the idea of, um, being obsessed with your mother so much that you will commit murder, uh, is definitely rooted in Gein's story.\nYeah.\nUm, if you're not familiar with Gein, he, not only... he was a... I don't even know if he was a serial killer. I think he only... I think he murdered one, maybe two people, but more than anything, he was a grave robber. But he likes to, um, dress up in people's skin, women's skin, and pretend he was his own mother, which, man, that's a lot of years on the couch working that one out.\nYeah.\nOr you can just die at the hands of cops. One of the two. Um, and he also inspired Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\nYeah. And, and Buffalo Bill, of course.\nOh, yeah. Yeah. Silence of the Lambs.\nYeah. One guy inspired all those, all those guys. So, I found this article, uh, Psycho: The Horror Movie That Changed the Genre, by, uh, Owen, uh, Glyberman, or is it Glyberman?\nGleber.\nGleberman.\nI think he wrote for... legendary critic wrote for EW for years and years and now writes for Variety.\nOh, he does.\nYeah. But he, uh, he put it best. He said, um, well, you know, the iconic shower scene, first of all, is hugely important because it was, uh, Hitchcock really kind of ripped up the script. Not literally, but the horror movie script when he kills off Janet Leigh halfway through the movie. It was... You just didn't do that at the time.\nNo. And came out of nowhere.\nAnd we've seen that come up later on, like at the end of Night of the Living Dead or Drew Barrymore and Scream. Hitchcock was the first one to do that.\nYeah. And, uh, Gleberman puts it, uh, this way. He said, uh, he was also slicing through years, decades, centuries even, of audience expectation that the hero or heroine of a fictional work would be shielded and protected or would at least die usually at the end in a way that made some sort of moral, dramatic sense, right?\nUh, in Psycho, the murder made no sense at all.\nRight.\nAnd he really kind of hits it on the head there. It was like, if, if you've never seen Psycho or heard of it, the movie's just going along about this woman who, like, steals some money from her work, and she's kind of on the lamb and checks into this hotel, and you don't even know it's a horror movie. You're thinking it's a movie about a lady who steals money and is trying to get away from getting caught, right?\nAnd then just out of nowhere, she's hacked up in a shower. And at the time, audiences, and still, if you haven't seen it, it's shocking, but audiences were just like, they didn't know what they'd seen.\nRight. Exactly.\nSo you, not only is the hero no longer safe, that means maybe you're not either.\nYeah.\nSo it has, it had a really huge, unsettling effect. And then Owen Gleberman points out that Hitchcock was so smart that he even... he even made a nod to the type of expected horror that the audience was used to in the house that he used for Psycho, the Bates house.\nYeah. There was this huge rambling Victorian mansion on a hill, and there was lots of taxidermy, and, uh, it was like over, overdecorated and just creepy. But up to that point, like, that was horror. That was what a horror movie looked like and felt like. And this was, this was kind of Hitchcock's homage to that. But at the same time, he was also putting the heel of his shoe on it as well.\nYeah. And that house was, I mean, almost a character in itself. Like, if you've ever seen the recreation of it at, uh, in, in Los Angeles, I think it's a Universal.\nDid you see it?\nOh, yeah.\nI never did. The closest I came was, um, I think, uh, when Different Strokes went there.\nThat's the closest you got to it.\nYeah.\nUh, yeah, man. If you've ever seen this thing in person, like, it's, it sends a chill up your back just seeing this thing in, like, a sunny Los Angeles day still.\nThat's awesome.\nIt's such an iconic house. It's like, oh, man. Uh, there it is. That's where Norman Bates lives. He's the most disturbed human of all time.\nRight.\nUh, so in the movie, of course, there was the mother character who is sort of, uh, referenced throughout the movie. And it is not until the end that you realize that there is no mother. Mother's dead, right?\nThere's just Norman Bates and all his rage and hang-ups.\nYeah. So all the monster movies about giant ants and or the creature from the black lagoon or monsters, things that were an other that a normal person had to do battle with, that was gone. Yeah. Now the monster had been on screen the whole time, and you hadn't noticed it. And now what do you think about your neighbor who has seemed a little weird from time to time before? Could he be a murderer who thinks he's his mother? Who knows?\nYeah. This is what Hitchcock did to everybody back in 1960. And you almost get... like, I think Owen Lieberman points it out. Yeah, he does. At the beginning, he basically says, like, um, we probably didn't see Psycho. If you're reading this, you're probably too young to have seen Psycho in 1960, and we should all feel sad that we didn't, because it so changed everything that we can't do anything but take it for granted now. And everything that's come since then has been trying to regain that shock and horror that it instilled in audiences, and, and thus far, no one's actually been able to do it.\nYeah. And the other thing I remember when I saw it when I was younger, I think I saw this when I was like 14ish. Um, and I think it had this impact on just about everyone. I don't think I took a shower for a month.\nI was straight up bathtub, curtain open, doors open, windows open.\nMaking your mom watch, she's keeping watch.\nNo, that would have been full circle back to psychology.\nOh, yeah. I guess so. Yeah.\nYou didn't even want to have anything to do with your mom.\nNo, man. Like, it, it changed the shower curtain industry for a while after that.\nYeah, I'll bet.\nVery good movie. And the, um, there were a couple of Hitchcock movies in the last few years, uh, two different ones, uh, one with Anthony Hopkins and one with Toby Jones that were both really good, and one was about the years that he was making Psycho. The other was about the years when he was making The Birds, and they were both really, really good movies, and you should check those out, too. You should repeat that. We just got a rare introjection from Null. So go ahead and say it again, Josh, in case it didn't come through. So, Null just said that, um, the director of The Black Coat's Daughter is Anthony Perkins, who played Norman Bates in Psycho's son. Wow. He also did another movie now that Null says that. Thanks, Null. Um, it's called The Pretty Little Thing That Lives in the House, which was another horror movie, a ghost story. I think that was his first one, and I think that might be on Netflix. That it's great. It's a really great movie, too.\nMan, this has got me fired up to see some horror movies. It's a renaissance of horror.\nYeah. It's tough, though, because Emily doesn't really dig it. So, I have to just find alone time to do this.\nYou got to watch it in the bathroom.\nAll right. Well, if you want to know more about horror movies, go watch horror movies. Go forth. Uh, and let us know what we missed, for God's sake.\nYeah. If you want to check out Grabster's list, type in horror movies on the search bar at houseofworks.com, and it'll bring up this fine, fine list that you'll disagree with. And, um, since I said disagree, it's time for listener mail.\nUh, this is from Eric, and I'm going to call it what he called it, Schoolhouse Rock nostalgia theory.\nAll right, I think he's pretty right on. This just came in. Actually, this is a hot take.\nUh, hey guys, in the Schoolhouse Rock episode, Josh made the statement that Gen Xers are the most nostalgic generation and attribute it to the success of Schoolhouse Rock. I'm going to offer my own theory. I propose that Gen X is nostalgic mostly for pop culture because of the prolifer... uh, that word of child-targeted advertisements and marketing in the '70s and '80s.\nHuh. Maybe.\nCertainly something we've talked about. Um, this theory's got legs.\nWhile our little impressionable brains were developing, we were being taught by those who were steering pop culture to long for and find fulfillment in the toys and other products our cartoons were pushing on us. Now, as adults, those messages are still deep in our psyche, and we can't shake the idea that we still really need those Star Wars action figures to be happy. Not because the toys and the shows were so great, but because we had been tricked into believing we need them. I have nothing scientific to back this up.\nJust a hunch.\nYeah. What you mean? There hasn't been a study from MIT, right, on Star Wars...\n\n\nToys?\n\nI'm kind of surprised by that as well. I thought you were being facetious at first, and then it just took a turn.\n\nYeah, I don't know which way's up at this point.\n\nYeah, nothing scientific to back this up, but I'd love to hear what you all think. See if anyone out there is uh any respectable and informed input. Love what you guys do.\n\nLove you, Eric.\n\nThat is from Eric Leuen. And Eric, uh I think that's super valid.\n\nYeah, I do too, Eric. I think you've really hit upon something here.\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about it.\n\nIf you have a great theory, fan theory, real life theory, whatever, we want to hear them there.
