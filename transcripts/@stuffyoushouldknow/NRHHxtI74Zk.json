  "cleanText": "[Music]\nHey, and welcome to the short stuff.\nI'm Josh.\nThere's Chuck.\nJerry's here, too.\nDave's not, but Jerry's here for Dave.\nYou know the whole rigma roll.\nIt's time for short stuff.\nSo, let's go.\nMeow.\nSo, Chuck, I'm glad you did that because I think that was a really great segue into this episode on a specific kind of cats.\nThat's right.\nUh, we're talking about the Bengal cat.\nUh, if you've ever seen a Bengal cat or if you look up a picture online now, uh, when it's safe, it looks like a cross between a leopard and a and a house cat because that's what it is.\nYeah.\nFull stop.\nI mean, it's kind of nuts, but there is a small wild leopard cat out there in southern and eastern Asia.\nUm, Piona illurius Bengalenis bangalencis.\nI got it in there somewhere.\nMaybe Jerry can chop all that up and edit it into the correct pronunciation.\nBut it's a tiny little cat that looks a lot like a leopard.\nAnd it is a wild cat.\nIt's not a leopard.\nIt's not even related to the leopard, but it's one half of this type of hybridized breed of cats that people keep as pets today.\nYeah.\nThat people pay a lot of money for.\nUm,\nOh, I imagine so.\nYeah.\nUm, they are uh, very willful, athletic cats, and we'll kind of get to their behavior later, but uh, let's go back about 6 million years.\nOkay.\nUh, to talk about how cats came to be, uh, there were a couple of um, groups of felines that that parted ways.\nUm, there was a very, you know, just sort of a regular small-bodied cat that was eventually the common ancestor of both of these groups.\nMhm.\nUh, one became uh, the one that you talked about, the uh, prianeleris.\nNope.\nYeah.\nI mean, that was closer than\nOkay.\nMaybe.\nYeah.\nUh, Bengalinsencis.\nMhm.\nNo.\nBengalinsencis.\nYou just did what I do.\nYou added a whole vowel in there.\nWell, why don't you take the next one because that one's easy.\nWild leopard cat.\nWell, no, I meant the other lineage.\nThe house cat, felis catis.\nYeah, exactly.\nSo, those are the two lines.\nUh, the felis catis is the what we most of us have in our homes that have cats.\nBut that other one, that leopard cat is uh, lives in southern and eastern Asia.\nUm, like you said, it's a wild cat.\nIt it prowls the forest and grasslands and stuff like that.\nAnd they're not huge.\nThey're 6 and 12 lbs to maybe 15 12 lbs.\nUm, and although they look like a leopard, they're, you know, like you said, they're clearly not.\nThey're they're they're small by comparison.\nNo, but like a leopard, they're covered in rosettes.\nThat's what leopard spots are called.\nAnd then the little the little plastic things on the end of shoelaces are called egglets.\nYou know those two things?\nCommon cross word clue, by the way, great.\nYeah, if you know those two things, you don't need to know anything else in the world because they'll just kind of open up all the doors you need from that point on.\nThat's right.\nBut rosettes, they're um, the little patches of fur, the little spots that leopards have.\nAnd um, that's one of the the main characteristics of the Bengal cat hybrid breed.\nUm, do you want to take an early break or do you want to keep going?\nWhat do you think?\nI say we keep going.\nWe're only a few minutes in.\nOkay.\nWell, let's talk about Willard Central Wall then.\nYeah.\nUh, this is a guy that is initially responsible for this um, crossbreed because in 1971 when he was a professor at Loma Linda University in California, he was working on trying to solve feline leukemia.\nAnd apparently that Bengal cat is uh, resistant to feline leukemia.\nSo he started working with hybridizing these cats to see what he could learn about this uh, scientifically speaking to help save cats.\nYeah.\nAnd we should say, I mean, there's a lot of people who are very um, not happy with the idea that people are hybridizing cats and creating designer cat breeds when there's tons of shelter cats that need to be adopted.\nI'm um,\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWillard Centraal, though, he seems to have just he did this innocently, like he wasn't trying to create a new designer breed of cat that he could sell, right?\nHe was doing it for scientific research.\nUh, enter another uh, breeder, Jean Mill, who actually was a um, a purposeful breeder of this new hybrid breed of cats, the what became the Bengal cat.\nShe collaborated with Center Wall, and she was a conservationist.\nAnd that won't make any sense for a little while, but will Oh, I'll bring it in now.\nThe reason that she, a conservationist, was in involved in creating a hybridized cat was because she thought that if you got little cats out there that looked like leopards, um, it would make people more um, empathetic toward leopards in the wild and hence would dry up the market for leopard skin coats and may even help conserve wild leopard populations because people um, adopted like what looked like a little baby leopard bird at home.\nYeah.\nAnd it is not lost on us that her last name was Mill.\nUh, save your email.\nUh, and we'll mention one more guy before we break.\nA breeder named Bill Angler uh, who was a zookeeper uh, and animal importer.\nWorked a lot with exotic animals and um, he had a leopard cat named Shaw in the early '70s and he breeded them and created a bunch of Bengal kittens.\nAnd um, I don't believe this, but people have surmised because his name was Bill Angler that the name Bengal uh, came from be angler, but I think it's clearly from that Asian leopard cat's name.\nSo much so that I don't know why people even came up with the other idea.\nAgreed.\nI think that's break time, huh?\nYeah.\nLet's do it.\nWe'll be right back.\n[Music]\nOh,\n[Music]\nyou should know.\n[Music]\nUh, so these cats, even though I'm completely against this kind of thing and selling uh, pets like this that at like for two grand a pop, they're amazing looking.\nUm, they're incredible.\nThey're gorgeous little tiny leopards.\nUm, the rosettes can take a various forms.\nUh, they can be kind of pointy.\nThey can kind of look like arrowheads.\nThey can be more circular.\nThey can look like paw prints.\nUm, the marblecoated Bengal is one of the coolest looking cats I've ever seen.\nUm, but again, I I don't want to sound like I'm endorsing this kind of thing, you know.\nNo, but I mean like the these things do exist and they are beautiful to look at and they do seem like pretty interesting cats as far as cats go, their personalities and what they demand from you.\nI was going to say require, but it seems like a demand.\nUm, they're also different uh, colored.\nThey have different colored coats beneath their rosettes, too.\nAll the way up to white, which imitates snow leopard, so it looks like a mini baby snow leopard essentially running around your house.\nBut they also have like brown, golden, charcoal gray, silverish.\nUm, and all these different rosette combinations with different coat combinations means that there's a infinite variety of Bengal kittens just waiting to be bred.\nYeah.\nUh, they are uh, muscular.\nThey're very athletic.\nUh, apparently their hind legs are a little taller than the shoulder, so they they look even a little different than your regular house cat.\nUm, they weigh just sort of like the ones in the wild, 8 to 15 pounds, which is can be small for a cat.\nUh, and they're, like I said, they're very energetic.\nThey like to take walks.\nThey don't lay around and sleep all day like other cats, apparently.\nUm, they like to swim, which is very unique for cats, right?\nYeah.\nThey're into water related activities like swimming.\nYeah.\nShowering with their owners, water skiing.\nYeah, I had wake boarding.\nBut yes, either one.\nI stepped on it.\nThat was even better.\nI stepped on yours, too.\nSo, there you go.\nAlthough, kneeboard a kneeboarding cat.\nMaybe that's the best joke.\nI thought in knee boarding, too.\nI workshopped it very briefly with myself and said wakeboarding is the way to go.\nUm, the thing is is a lot of people buy these things and they're like, \"Oh, this is going to go with my purse.\nI'm gonna carry this cat around whenever I have my purse and then probably ignore it the rest of the time I have it.\nUm, they're buying these cats for their looks essentially, which is I mean that's kind of one of the things that that they're bred for is their looks.\nThe problem is even if they're expecting like this is a cat I'm going to take care of.\nMost people are totally unprepared for just how different Bengal cats are from your average cat.\nLike you said, all the stamina, all the um, if they get bored, they're very aggressive.\nSo, you don't want them to get bored because just say bye-bye to your errands rent furniture, right?\nUm, like you're like you are you're in for it if you buy a Bengal cat and take it as your own.\nYou It's just going to be way more work than the average cat, which can usually amuse itself.\nSo, a lot of people buy two to keep them busy with one another.\nYeah.\nUh, yeah, and I guess they have a lot of money cuz I saw that snow uh, leopard version can go for like two grand.\nI am surprised that's all.\nYeah, I guess I can see breeders charging way more than that.\nI'm really surprised.\nYeah, that's a value.\nWell, uh, apparently if they have wild parents or grandparents, um, it's even worse and they require even more socialization than, you know, which makes sense than the ones who are, uh, further removed from that wild uh, lineage.\nUm, and I looked up online because this article from How Stuff Works, not sure when it was, but it said like Hawaii as a state has put a ban on breeding and ownership.\nAnd then so I looked up and there there are quite a few states that either have uh, outright bans on ownerships um, or bans on breeding or both or if they don't have bans they have a lot of uh, like you have to have a permit and like hoops you have to jump through to get one of these things, right?\nSo um, yeah, people are kind of standing up and or you know cat rescue organizations are obviously standing on their podium and screaming like please don't support this kind of thing.\nDo not buy hybrid cats.\nYeah.\nIf you ever d drive past a strip mall and it says cats or puppies or something, kittens on a sign, you want to keep driving.\nOh, well, unless it's uh, they're doing like an adoption event on the sidewalk.\nThat's a little different.\nI'm talking more like a permanent sign that they pay a sign maker to put up like on the shopping centers directory.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI just wanted to draw that distinction because that's what they will often do is set up in front of like Petco or something.\nYeah.\nUh, Yumi and I were looking once at a Petco at um, before we got Mo.\nUm, and there was there were dogs they had it was so sad they had dogs that had all different kinds of special needs or handicaps kind of sequestered off from the other dogs.\nAnd among these dogs there was a little Chihuahua and apparently the only thing unusual about him was that um, he couldn't retract his tongue.\nSo his tongue was always sticking out and you had to keep his tongue moist.\nYeah.\nIt looks super cute.\nLike it was um, that's just always stuck with me.\nYeah.\nI mean there's there's a breed of dog that has that tongue out full time, right?\nI don't know that I think that like the the supposedly ugliest dog on earth that breed whatever it is that is like patchy hair and looks kind of crazy and has it I think they have their tongue permanently out.\nThey have a non- retractable tongue I guess.\nSo I'll look at We should do a short stuff on that dog because I don't like some calling an animal the ugliest whatever.\nNo, that sounds kind of internet clickbay, you know.\nYeah, agreed.\nAll right.\nUh, well, I think we're at the end of Bengal Cats, E.\nYes.\nOkay.\nSee you guys.\nShort stuff's out.\nStuff You Should Know is a production of iHeartRadio.\nFor more podcasts, iHeart Radio, visit the iHeart Radio app, APPLE PODCASTS, or
