So we gave it a shot. And today you're going to be listening to uh the replay of our episode on BlacKkKlansman. Uh, the true story behind that movie. It's a great movie. Love it. Love Spike Lee. Uh, and this is a great one. So uh, I hope you enjoy the show.\n\nWelcome to STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW from howstuffworks.com.\n\nHey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles Bryant. There's Jerry over there. You put the three of us together, it's Movie Crush. I mean, STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW. This does have some stank on it, doesn't it? Some movie stank. Uhhuh. I I know your game. It's cool. Uh, I didn't even ask you, have you seen BlacKkKlansman? I I was like, I can't I can't do this episode without having seen it, so I watched it last night. Oh, nice. Yeah, it's good, huh? Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah, I I like uh I like his choice at the end to like just completely pull a somersault on the viewer. Oh, sure. With that last bit. Yeah, like spoiler alert, there's an end to the movie. Spoilery. Yeah, for sure. We should probably say that out of the gate. If you haven't seen this yet and you don't want it to be spoiled, don't listen to this episode first. Yes. But um yeah, the I guess now that we've said that, we can speak freely, right? Yes. So, um the if if the entire movie was basically to disarm you up to the end, then I I think it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in my life. And even if it wasn't, that wasn't the entire point of the movie. It was still It was still great. And how he pulled it out at the end, I think. Yeah. Well, this was I don't know if you remember, but this is the movie I saw in Perth, Australia. So, that happens at the end. That big uh you know Mhm. sort of gut punch. Yeah. Of realism at the end. And uh I stood up and I was like, h like wonder what they they're thinking here in Perth, right? They're probably thinking, what just happened? What's wrong with America? Yeah. And I'm going, hi mate. Uh good to see you. I'm not American. I'm Canadian. Can't you tail bloke? Oh goodness. Uh yeah, it was it was one of those things where I was like I'm kind of slightly embarrassed right now. Yeah, like that. I enjoyed the movie though. I thought to see Spike Lee, who um just he's one of my favorite filmmakers in his 60s still just bringing the juice like this, I loved it. Yeah. I also loved that it was controversial, too. um in that like some people criticize Spike Lee for like not going far enough for maybe kind of um glossing over some of the ugly aspects of the the story. Yeah. You want to get to that at the end maybe? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But we'll we'll give it a pre-mention shout out which is what we just did. Right. So, we are talking about the uh the true story of the film BlacKkKlansman. Uh, Spike Lee's movie that won the grand prize at the Khan Film Festival. It's nominated for Academy Awards. Uh yeah, three Oscars I believe for including best picture. Yeah, I think picture director and supporting actor uh for who? I would guess Adam Driver. I didn't see really. Yeah, I was surprised because Denzel's son did a wonderful job as well. He loves he loves that being known as that, right? I can't remember his first name, but you know, Denzel's son. He uh he was um like there were several times when he was talking and I was like, &quot;Oh, you are definitely Denzel Washington's son, man.&quot; Just the the way he talked, the the um the sound of his voice, but also his acting, too. He's a good actor. Yeah. So, all right. Best picture, best supporting actor for Adam Driver. uh best director and best original music score. Oh, nice. Uh but yeah, he is uh I didn't know he was Denzel's son till after the movie. Yeah, I could see that. And he was a football player. Did you know that? I didn't. Who'd he play for? He played for Morehouse here in Atlanta. He was a running back and then played NFL on the practice squad for the Rams. And then eventually played a few years in NFL Europe and the UFFL until he hung up his cleats. six years ago. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Playing football in Europe has got to be a surreal experience, you know. Yeah, because it's a soccer ball. Everyone's like, &quot;What are you doing? This is all wrong.&quot; All right. So, should we back it to the 1970s? The groovy 70s of Denver, Colorado. First, first we should say his name is John David Washington. Oh, sure. You were kidding, right? Denzel's son. Yes. So yeah, let's get in the way back machine and see uh go inspect their terrible low-quality pot. So uh Ron Stallworth is is the true to life character's name who there was a football player growing when we were growing up named John Stalworth. So I'm always wanting to say John Stalworth. This is not him. This is a cop named Ron Stallworth. That's right. And he had a a few designations that are pretty important. He was the first African-American police officer uh to work for the Colorado Springs Police Department uh which he joined as a cadet at the age of 19. Yeah. In 72 and then a couple of years later on his 21st uh birthday on his 21st birthday. That's what I saw. Yeah. June 18th, I believe. Nice. Was sworn in as a full-on officer of the law. Right. And I'm not sure if like they just swear you in on your 21st birthday or if it just so happened that the swearing in ceremony was on his 21st birthday, but regardless, it was a big deal. He's the first African-American cop and then later on detective for Colorado Springs. So that's that's a big deal, especially starting out at age 21, too. That takes a lot of coahones, as they call it in Colorado. No, I think they call those Rocky Mountain oysters. That's right. That is what they call them for sure. So he uh worked undercover for about 30 years. Um long great career as an undercover detective. Um but it was this case which um only came out about four years ago when he wrote a book about it about his career um when he went undercover as a well as a clansman. But it's a little more complicated than that. It is a it was a very complicated operation. Right. Yeah. And and this wasn't something that like um I mean he even says in this NPR interview that he didn't it was just a job at that particular point in time and when that particular job ended that is the undercover stint which was about what eight or nine months I moved on to something else and it just happened by circumstance. So he didn't come in there uh with a bone to pick with the clan aside from probably every bone to pick that he had with the clan right just as a black man in America. Yeah. And it would probably help to give a little background on the clan at the time because, you know, the clan was very well known for being really big and really violent at over three waves is basically how the clan history is divided. Yeah. Like the first wave was when they were um they were founded in the wake of the the civil war. Um then they they had a the second wave came around the 19s like 1915 I mean um that that era and then they they had another big resurgence during the civil rights era in the 50s and 60s. But you know in between these waves and after that third wave it's not like the clan just went away. They just they kept on going. their profile was lower and maybe their um the uh the public violence or terrorism that they were engaging in wasn't quite as pronounced, but they were still there. And in Colorado in particular, it had a really long history with the clan where basically the city of Denver was in the under the control of the clan back in the 20s, just, you know, 50 years before um Ron Stallworth started working there. Yeah. He was uh he got when he when he got hired there, he got access to files, like secret FBI files, right? And he got to go in and dig in and look at the history of the clan in Colorado. And boy, like you ain't kidding. They were uh in the House of Representatives. There were senators. Both senators were clans members. Uh the mayor uh Benjamin Stapleton, who the airport was named after until 95. Yeah. his great-grandson ran for governor um on the GOP ticket this past election and and lost to uh who is Colorado's first ever openly gay Jewish governor. Oh wow. Mhm. Colorado is a weird state. It is an odd state for sure. A lot of different ideologies all packed in together. It's very purple in all sorts of ways. Yeah. So, uh Mayor Benjamin Stapleton was a clan member. Uh the governor, Clarence Mley, was a clan member. Um the chief of police, which is I mean, you don't want anyone in these positions to be clan members, but I imagine a chief of police is one of the more problematic areas to have a person in that kind of control. Particularly that one, too. He was basic he was picked by the clan, the the Colorado clan um and basically foisted on Benjamin Stapleton who who who was even like wow this guy's even too much for my tastes and um eventually fired him but like the clan picked the chief of police of Denver, Colorado back in the 20s. Oh yeah. And they tried to recall Stapleton at one point. Mhm. Uh it didn't work and when that effort failed uh the clan burned across on the top of Table Mountain as a celebration uh a show of public celebration. Right. So the the clan has deep roots in a old story in Colorado or at least they used to and they were still very much around when um uh when Ron Stallworth started his his investigation or started as the um the first black uh detective in Colorado Springs. Right. That's right. And so he started out, I guess, as kind of plain clothes and was assigned um undercover work pretty quickly just just by his um just by being the only African-American uh officer in the police force because Stokeley Carmichael came to town once. That's right. And this is in the film. We're going to talk about a few differences between the movie and and the real story, but uh he did in fact go to a uh a speech and a rally by famous Black Panther Stokeley Carmichael. And he was, you know, fully kitted out in his bell bottoms and uh his wearing a wire. He picked his afro out. And he in fact did make a point to meet him just like he did in the film. And Carmichael did apparently say, &quot;Arm yourself and get ready because the revolution is coming.&quot; And I imagine Stalworth had some mixed feelings about that assignment. Yeah, I would guess so. Um, it's kind of like I don't really have any idea of what he he personally was like because the movie mixed things up so much and like added layers that weren't necessarily there. So, I have no idea what what that experience would have been like for him, you know. Yeah. One thing we do know is not true is the character in the film of Patrice, uh, whom he meets at that rally, a young woman that he falls in love with, uh, she was made up for the movie, uh, Spike Lee wanted a a love interest basically and to represent sort of the the female black power movement as a whole, right? So, she was completely made up, but she was terrific in the film. Yeah. Yeah. Laura Harrier, she's in the the new Spider-Man movies, too. She's awesome. Cool. the new Spider-Verse movie. No, no, no. That's animated. Oh, okay. Well, she could have been a voice actor, I guess, right? Yeah. No, she's in the one the new ones with the the new the new kid. Okay. The new Spidey kid. Current Spider-Man. Current Spider-Man, which is great. Those are good movies. I haven't seen any of them. You're not super into that stuff, though, are you? Well, I saw the uh Infinity War one. He was in that, I think. Yeah. He's a bit of a smart Alec, frankly. He is. Um, so okay, he he does his research on the deep roots of the clan in Colorado. He goes undercover and then I don't think he was even assigned this thing. I think he kind of came up with it on his own by chance almost uh in October 1978. He was 25 at this point and he was looking through the local paper. Well, that was part of his assignment to gather intelligence by reading the paper. Well, right. But I don't think I think this was his idea to go undercover like this. That's the impression I have too. He seemed like a a self-starter uh in a lot of ways. So he found this ad um a classified ad in the paper for the clan uh said get in touch if you want further information. Uh he sent a letter posing as a white racist uh to a PO box just thinking that he would just get back some pamphlets or something. Right. So, he signed his real name, which is uh he didn't really think that one through. No, he didn't. And he did he never really fully explains it aside from the the the best explanation I saw is that he didn't think anything was going to come of it. He thought he'd get, like you said, a couple of pamphlets and that would be that. Um, and he just wasn't planning to to create like a large investigation out of making contact through this this ad. And and again, we should probably state this. It was an ad in the paper for the clan to get in touch with the clan to get more info about the clan and maybe you might want to join. Who knows\n\n\nRight?\nUm, so, so he makes contact with them by sending off a letter.\nAnd if you ask me, if if Spike Lee were directing this episode, he would put an ad break right here.\nThat was good.\nWho are we to disagree?\nAll right, we'll be right back.\n[Music]\nOkay, so like we said, Ron Stallworth is thumbing through the newspaper.\nHe mails off a uh a letter to get more info about the clan and um he uses his real name and and like like you said, Chuck, he was expecting like a pamphlet or something in return like, \"So, you want to be a clan member?\" or something like that, right?\nUm instead, about two weeks later, he got a call from the the number.\nSo, he used everything as far as the undercover operation would go.\nUm he used all of his undercover info except for his name.\nSo he got a call on his undercover phone line from a guy named Ken Odell and he was pretty surprised to get this call because again he was expecting a pamphlet and instead he had a real live living breathing Ku Klux Clansman on the other end of the line saying hey uh I got your letter about hating black people and other minorities.\nLet's talk.\nYeah.\nHe was like why are you interested?\nAnd Stallworth immediately just kind of goes into character.\nUh, and I guess that's what you, you know, when you're undercover, you you got to be part improv actor, right, to be able to pull that off.\nWell, he also, he said he drew from his own personal experiences because he grew up in El Paso and and encountered a lot of racism there and I'm sure on the force in Colorado Springs, too.\nSo, he drew from his own experience as well.\nYeah.\nSo he uh basically right out of the gate says, \"Well, you know, uh my sister's dating a black man and every time he puts his hands on her on her pure white body, I cringe and I want to do something about it.\"\nAnd Ken Odell says, \"You sound like a great guy.\nWhy don't you come on down and let's meet because you are just the kind of uh kind of dude we're looking for.\nYou sound like real clan material.\"\nYeah.\nI thought about maybe doing an episode on the clan.\nI thought about that, too.\nAnd then I'm like, do you want to give them a platform?\nYeah.\nBut then I thought, or, you know, you could just talk about it and how stupid they are.\nAll right.\nLike it when I was a kid.\nI mean, of course, being in Georgia, that stuff was around.\nI never like saw it firsthand, obviously.\nYeah.\nBut you heard things even like growing up in the 70s in Georgia and I was always so scared of the whole thing because of the outfits and everything and the fire, right?\nUh and I was a good little Baptist boy.\nSo there was a lot of fear, but then I got a little older and I was like, they're just dumb rednecks wearing sheets, right?\nSort of demystified it.\nThis is the moment you become an adult.\nYeah.\nBut I mean, of course, then I would later learn that they did real horrific things and took lives and, you know, are a terrorist organization, right?\nRight.\nBut I think what you're saying is they they made themselves up to be boogeymen.\nYeah.\nExactly.\nAnd they definitely can be that way, especially in the a young mind or something like that.\nBut Yeah.\nYeah.\nUm, so, so back to the story, Ron Stallworth is on the phone with this guy named Ken Odell who wants to meet him to see if he'd like to join the clan.\nAnd this is a big problem because I think as we mentioned a couple of times, Ron Stallworth was African-American.\nYeah.\nHe's like, \"Oh boy, what do I do here?\"\nRight.\nSo, he actually uh recruited a fellow detective who he in his book calls Chuck.\nThat's all he's ever publicly referred to the guy as is Chuck.\nWait, was it you, Chuck?\nIt was not me.\nUh that that gentleman is I guess either still undercover or just never wanted his identity out there.\nRight.\nSo he uh yeah, he may still live in Colorado Springs.\nWho knows?\nMaybe he's on a case right now for all I know.\nBut uh so this Chuck guy uh he's he was recruited by Ron Stallworth to play Ron Stallworth to the clan because Chuck was white.\nHe was already an undercover narcotics agent.\nAnd apparently he was friendly enough with Ron Stallworth to say, \"Yes, I will I will join this investigation, buddy.\nLet's do it.\"\nYeah.\nAnd here's the thing, though.\nHe was uh he this wasn't his like primary case.\nSo Chuck is undercover on a lot of different assignments.\nSo he's not around as much as Stallworth needs him.\nMhm.\nSo like in the movie, most of this stuff is done over the phone.\nLike he spends a lot of time in this investigation on the phone.\nMhm.\nspeaking uh to these clansmen who think that he's a white man.\nAnd when they needed to meet, he would send Chuck in who uh and we'll get to the voice part in a minute because that's when I was watching the movie, I was like, \"Do none of these dummies not realize that they don't sound anything alike, right?\"\nYou know, cuz they've been talking to him on the phone at length.\nYeah.\nUm but they had they had their first meeting.\nUm they uh they got together and I believe they met um they met somewhere at first and then went to a bar after like as the second part of that meeting.\nYeah.\nThey met at a conven so the movie supposedly portrays this realistically.\nThey they this Chuck guy who is portraying Ron Stallworth to the clan um met they met at a convenience store and he was said he was told to get in the car and then they drove to a second location which man that's scary stuff.\nAnd also he's also wearing a wire at the time.\nLike that's something that that the the movie kind of gets across but especially in like articles about the story don't necessarily dive into.\nThis Chuck Cat was like putting himself out there.\nOh, sure.\nAs every undercover detective does, right?\nSo, I mean, Ron Stallworth is conducting this investigation.\nHe's the mastermind of it.\nHe's leading this whole thing.\nBut this poor Chuck guy has to go hang out with these, you know, violent clans members or clan members on, you know, like fairly frequently from what I understand.\nSo, hats off to him.\nOh, yeah.\nAbsolutely.\nI mean, it was it was definitely like it required both of their best efforts to get away with this for that long, right?\nwas quite the ruse.\nSo, uh, Chuck meets with them, eventually earns their trust along with the the phone work of Stallworth, and then he actually gets, um, successfully admitted about 2 months later and got his little I guess you get a little membership card.\nHe still has it.\nHe does.\nHe did not throw it away like in the movie.\nHe has it framed, in fact.\nUh and on the back of the card were six codes of conduct.\nOne of which said um never discuss any clan affairs with any plane close officer on a state, local or national level.\nRight.\nSo there is a lot of comedy in the movie if you haven't seen it.\nUm\nI mean it's it's a serious thing that they're doing, but there are a lot of laughs as well.\nA lot of laughs and a lot of like movie formula steps that that Spikeley purposefully follows, you know, very faithfully, too.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAbsolutely.\nSo, um, there's a big point there that we left out though, Chuck.\nSo to get that membership card supposedly like again as they say in Colorado the oysters on this guy his he had so he met so the fake um fake Ron Stallworth Chuck met with the clan impressed them enough between Ron the real Ron Stallworth's phone calls and Chuck's whatever Chuck was saying in in person.\nAll this combined made the the Colorado Springs clan members say, \"Okay, we like you.\nWe want you to be a member.\nfill out this application and we'll send it off to the um to the national director of of again the clan we should say I don't know if we've ever said this the clan calls itself the organization right rather than the clan so they and and the guy who ran the thing I don't know if he still runs it or not but he definitely did at this time during this investigation is a guy named David Duke who if you grew up in the 80s or I think even the 90s you were probably pretty familiar with David Duke I believe he ran president once, didn't he?\nI don't know.\nI mean, he he was Wasn't he the governor of Louisiana?\nI don't Maybe that's what it is.\nMaybe he ran for that.\nBut he was the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Clan, and he was trying to make it a more political organization, less less of a terrorist organization and more of a political organization under his guidance, but it was still the Ku Klux Clan.\nLike there were still plenty of times when he was wearing robes and stuff.\nHe just never did in public.\nSo during this time, he was he was the national director, the grand wizard of the clan.\nAnd when Ron Stallworth didn't get his application pushed through fast enough, he picked up the phone and called the national headquarters and ended up to talking with David Duke and saying like, \"Hey, my application's taking a while.\nIs there anything you can do about it?\"\nAnd this kicked off like a what what um Ron Stallworth would later characterize in a weird way as a friendship between him, a black undercover detective in Colorado, and David Duke, the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Clan.\nYeah.\nAnd by the way, I don't want to get uh angry emails from David Duke's supporters.\nUhhuh.\nUh he was a uh Republican um Louisiana state rep.\nHe was not governor.\nUm but but I think he ran for some some high office.\nOh, he did.\nHe ran uh he was a candidate for the Democratic presidential primaries in the late 80s and then the Republican primaries in '92.\nHe ran as a Democrat and then a uh I could see that solid South kind of thing.\nYeah.\nAnd I think he ran for state senate and lost.\nUh US Senate and lost, uh US House and lost.\nAnd he did run for governor of Louisiana, but he lost.\nGotcha.\nOkay.\nand and you may be if you're if you didn't grow up in the 80s, you may have heard his name more recently uh because um he fully endorsed uh Donald Trump's campaign and after Donald Trump won, he um this was his quote on Twitter.\nUh make no mistake, our people have played a huge role in electing Trump.\nSo he was he was in the news again more recently.\nWell, he was also in Charlottesville um if not leading the the rally to unite the right.\nDefinitely a a big speaker at it, a big a big part of it.\nUm and Spike Lee uses some of his footage from that rally u to kind of get across that, you know, this stuff is still going on.\nThis isn't from the 70s or or earlier.\nHow great was Toe for Grace?\nHe was wonderful.\nHe was so good.\nAnd he looks a lot like David Duke of the 70s.\nHe really does.\nUnfortunately for him, the stash and the three-piece suits and all that.\nSo yeah, he did a good job.\nBut so so yeah, in the movie Toe for Grace from that 70s show.\nUm always he will always be from that 70s show.\nYeah, he plays um what do you want me to say?\nLike he he had a bit part in Oceans 11 or something.\nBrad Pitt's character was teaching him to play poker.\nI think I forgot about that.\nYou know that guy.\nNo, he's that 70s show of course.\nSo, so he uh he plays David Duke in the in the movie and there this this is this is it's really funny like Spike Lee added stuff that just you you would think like well yeah of course it's totally believable like Chuck being Jewish in real life and he actually wasn't.\nThat's that's fabricated by the movie.\nSo you would just not even think twice about that.\nBut it turns out that's not true.\nThe stuff that seems the least true is actually the stuff that actually happened.\nAnd for a very long time, well, at the very least over the course of this 9-month investigation, there were multiple phone calls that were very cordial and friendly where um Ron Stallworth would call David Duke and posing as a white clan member and pump information.\nThey would talk about, you know, David Duke's family and like just have nor normal conversations that would inevitably turn back to racism and the um the the weakening of the white race uh at the hands of, you know, the Jewish media and all the minorities who were taking over.\nAnd so it would it would inevitably turn disgusting.\nBut he he said later, I think in the book and in interviews where if you could separate that stuff out, he was actually a pleasant person to talk to.\nAnd that's where that weird friendship that he characterized it as kind of developed from those conversations.\nBut there is like he couldn't make this stuff up, you know.\nExactly.\nBut there is at least one video of David Duke basically admitting that yes, this he had conversations with this guy.\nHe tries to downplay it.\nSure.\nBut uh he does basically verify that yes, that's true.\nThat really happened.\nWell, and Duke's probably like I can't remember every phone call I had with every random racist over the years, right?\nThere were a lot of them.\nEven this guy posing as one.\nUm, all right.\nWell, let's take another break and uh we're going to go uh we're going to talk a little bit more about this weird David Duke relationship right after this.\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nAll right.\nSo, he's buddying up with David Duke on the phone.\nHe's fooling everybody.\nAnd he even like you get the sense that he does have a little bit of sense of humor um Stalworth because at one point he even goatated him on the phone a little bit and this is in the movie and it was totally true.\nYeah.\nHe said you know Mr. Duke have you ever worried about like a black man posing as a white man and infiltrating your organization?\nAnd Duke said no.\nAnd he said uh and this this is from the NPR interview with Stalworth.\nsaid, \"I can\n\n\ntell you're white because you don't talk like a black man.\" He said, \"You talk like a very smart, intellectual white man, and I can tell by the way you pronounce certain words.\" And he said, \"You know, give me an example.\" And he said, \"Black people tend to pronounce the word r, ara, and I can tell by listening to you that you're not black because you do not pronounce that word in that manner. It's science.\"\nCase closed.\nOh boy, he was so easily duped. I love it. Uh and then they also uh did in fact meet in person. Um that part is true as well. Duke came to town um and was having lunch. It was not a big ceremony uh like in the movie, but he came to town to have lunch and the department assigned Stalworth to protect him. And so he goes there to the restaurant, introduces himself to protect him. Duke says, \"All right, I appreciate you uh them, you know, sending someone my way.\" And Chuck is undercover there as well. And he does in fact Stalworth pose with David Duke and gets a Polaroid with him.\nSo this sounded to me like what what was the what was going on here? Like I mean like you've got this investigation going. This is this takes place during this this undercover investigation that Stalworth's conducting.\nYou have a guy who's already like putting himself out there, Chuck, as as the white Ron Stalworth. And then the chief says, \"Oh, yes. By the way, um you the only African-American police officer in our entire um squad, you go be David Duke's uh bodyguard for the day while he's in town in Colorado Springs.\" Like, that was just bizarre. And not only do it um do that that that very like obvious overt act slap in the face to David Duke, which is great, but if it but it could have jeopardized like this whole this whole thing because you also you had the guy portraying Ron Stalworth uh um in the same room at the same lunch. It just seemed really strange. And again, that was one of those things where when you watch the movie, you would think like, well, that's just made up. No, that actually took place, at least according to Ron Stallworth's memoirs, and that that that Chuck was in the room, was asked to take a picture by Ron Stalworth with David Duke and the Grand Dragon, I guess, who must be like the head of the state in Colorado. And then at the last second when he was counting down, he put his arms around the shoulders of the two clan guys and then got his hands on the picture.\nApparently, all of that was the case, but he's since lost the picture.\nYeah. And Duke really did try to get it back and uh Stalworth like got to it quicker and said basically like if you try to take this thing, I will have you arrested for assaulting a police officer. Like don't do it. Don't think about it.\nRight. So, he said he lost it in a move. He wish he had taken better care of it. But, um the idea that it was like that's just so nuts. It tells you a lot about the investigation though to me. Like it makes you say like, \"Okay, how seriously were they taking this investigation at the time?\" If Stalworth later said, \"All right, this is this is just um you know, this is just another job to me. When I started it, I did the job and then when it was done, I moved on to another job.\" The fact that he didn't talk about it much until I think he spoke about it to the press once in 2006 in a a Desert News article um and then didn't talk about it again until 2014 when his memoirs came out. Um it was just like a a thing that they were doing that other people were doing other stuff too. Um and then to to have like that part of it that the idea that you would you would jeopardize it in that way just makes it seem like they weren't taking it as that big of a an operation as as like the movie would like to to believe. I'm not sure. Well, I think in in real life it was a it was a information gathering investigation. Like it was never we're going to take down the clan in Colorado. Um it was let's infiltrate and get as much information and factf finding as we can.\nMhm.\nUm and in the end after 8 months um that's kind of what happened. It was he considers uh Stalworth considers it a success in that they fulfilled their mission. Mhm.\nUm they did prevent three cross burning ceremonies during that 8-month span or 9-month span, right? And they did identify um clan members who worked at NORAD, right? Who apparently they said they uh I mean these days they would be fired probably, but they said they reassigned them to like Greenland or something, right? Because they had access to the to nuclear weapons. Apparently they had very high level clearance at NORAD, which is scary. And then they also found plans that they didn't act on. Like the whole bomb plot in the movie was was made up for dramatic purposes, but uh they did find links between a for a plan to um bomb a gay nightclub and another plan to steal automatic weapons from an army base, like an inside job.\nMhm.\nSo, it was, you know, it was valuable work they were doing for sure. It just wasn't like we're going to take the clan down. Like I don't think it was the the department's big uh big job at the time.\nNo, certainly not. And and in the memoirs and in the movie too, the the reason that's given for the the um the undercover operation to end is because it started to become successful. Um Ron Stalworth was nominated to lead the Colorado Springs chapter of the clan. Like Ken Odell basically said, \"You should take my job. Everybody likes you. You're really good at this. You're smart. um you should lead the clan here. Uh and the the police chief of Colorado Springs said, \"That's it. Close it down. Burn all the evidence of this investigation.\" He apparently was worried about what what a PR nightmare it would be if it got out that some of his detectives were in the Colorado Springs clan. But at the same time, what strikes me as odd is that the FBI wasn't like, \"Oh, well, geez, this guy is like being nominated to lead the Colorado Springs clan, right? He's talking to David Duke.\" Like really that this this could not be kind of blown up into a larger investigation or a larger sting or something like that. And then secondly, and um Ron Stalworth himself addresses this, the there's a very frequently a criticism of well, if this was such a big operation and they found all this stuff, why wasn't anyone arrested? Why weren't there any arrests? And David Duke says, right, not just David Duke. Stalworth says also that some that in law enforcement too, people question that like why wasn't anyone arrested? And he said it was an intel investigation and and that's what they did was they gathered stuff. But then he very rightly points out like you said like the fact that they prevented cross burnings alone makes it a worthwhile and valuable operation. I think just some people on the outside are saying well why wasn't why wasn't more done? Why didn't more come out of this? You know and I'm not quite sure what they're driving at but there are you know Stalworth brings that up in an interview I read with him like that people do ask that and wonder about that.\nYeah. And Stalworth uh is very proud of the fact that with the cross burnings he was like no I can't remember the quote but he said something about like no children in Colorado Springs got to you know no young black kids had to see crosses on fire right during that eight or ninemonth period and uh very proud of that as they should be.\nYeah for real.\nUh, so I mentioned the voice earlier and the fact that he had a a different voice obviously than Chuck and um he said one time, only one time uh and I think this was in the movie, wasn't it?\nUm, or was it? It's been a while.\nYeah, it was actually. No, it was. I remember.\nYeah.\nSo, one time in the whole investigation did someone say like, \"Wait a minute, you sound different.\" Um Chuck had just been at a in-person meeting, came back uh and then um Stalworth wants to follow up on the phone with Ken Odell about something right afterward. So he had just heard Chuck's voice for whatever this whole meeting and was talking to him and he was like, \"Wait a minute, you sound different. What's going on?\" And he he just pulled it off. He coughed and said he had a sinus infection and Ken Odell was like, \"Oh well, here's how you clear that up.\" And gave him some good sinus medication advice, right? Yeah, they definitely appeared in the movie. I mean, you could not make this thing up, you know? It's crazy.\nNo, for real.\nAnd apparently for a long time, Stalworth was saying like, \"Yeah, it was just another job. It was just another operation.\" And I guess he told some some fellow like law enforcement friends or whatever about it. And they're like, \"Dude, you this is a movie. You need to write this down. You need to get this out there. You This is a a one ina million story.\"\nYeah. I wonder one reason it didn't go bigger operationwise was because the sort of hackneed way they got into it. Like he's the voice but they're sending a a white man.\nI can see that.\nLike it's it's I'm surprised he pulled it off for that long.\nYeah, I could totally see that. Uh, one final thing that did not happen in real life but did happen in the movie and this is what when you usually will change real life is to to get a more satisfying ending. But uh, Stalworth did not unfortunately reveal his true identity to David Duke like he does uh to hilarious effect in the film unfortunately.\nNo, how sad to learn that he was saying like yeah, he just he didn't really talk about it until the 2000s. So, David Duke didn't know until I guess the memoirs came out.\nYeah. And you know, well, I guess we should talk about Spike Lee getting criticized. Um, Boots Riley, director, uh, who I had on Movie Crush, by the way. He um I know. What was his movie? Uh, sorry to Bother You was his film that he made.\nNo, I mean his pick for Movie Crush.\nHis pick was a movie called Mishima, A Life in Four Chapters.\nOkay.\nYeah, it was a great film and his like his knowledge on movies was deep. He turned me on to a lot of cool things.\nI thought for a very a very terrible second you were saying his pick was his own movie.\nNo. No.\nBut he uh you know Boots does not hold back on what he thinks. Um, and while you would think that he would be like, \"Oh, no. I'm going to be a champion of Spike Lee and telling the story,\" he came out very publicly on Twitter and ve very uh, intelligently criticized it. He didn't just bag on it. He wrote a big um, long statement on exactly what he thought was wrong with it. Yeah. He basically said, \"Look, man, if you take away all the embellishments that Spike Lee added to this movie, what you have is a a guy who who's probably biggest assignment, and I'm not sure where he got this, but he focused on that that um Stokeley Carmichael thing and the fact that um Ron Stalworth had worked undercover um to infiltrate the Black Power movement in Colorado Springs and that he had worked on that for like three years and that this clan thing was just a like a nine-month thing. And he also criticized Spikeley for making it making the movie seem like law enforcement and the black power movement came together to fight racism, right? And that that like that was a larger point or that that was historically accurate or something like that. Um it was a a really interesting it was like a three-page essay that he posted on Twitter that made some good points. He basically said, \"From what I can tell, it looks like Ron Stalworth was working for COINTELP Pro, which is the FBI's um it was their their program to undermine groups, including Black Power Groups, which we mentioned it in the Black Panther episode we did, and it co-intelpro definitely deserves its own episode.\" Yeah. And it was it was ended officially in 1971, but I think Boots Riley's point was um it might have been officially ended, but the the work was still going on. And if this guy was infiltrating black power um like groups in Colorado Springs, he was almost certainly trying to break them up one way or another, probably using co-intel um purposes or or practices. And Ron Stalworth, he had a pretty great quote in response to it. He said, um, I pray for my demented, dissolute brother in response to Boots Riley. And Spike Lee has no comment about it whatsoever. So, who knows? But you make a good point that like he's he's he's not just giving like blind allegiance to anything. Sure.\nWell, Spike did comment eventually. Um\nOh, I didn't see that.\nYeah, he was he was in an interview and the first thing he said was like, \"Hey, I'm a I'm a young man of 61 or something like that.\" Like, you know, young me might have kind of gotten into a war of words, but he's just not into that anymore. Um, but he did say uh briefly something about Listen, I'm not going to come out and say that all cops are racist and all cops do bad things cuz they don't all do bad things. There's a lot of great cops. There's also bad cops. Um, and he kind of just couched it in that and then was like, but you know, I'm not going to be really talking about this anymore.\nRight. Yeah. I hadn't seen that. That he'd even have that comment.\nYeah.\nSo, it's interesting stuff and it's a good movie at the very least.\nOh, for sure.\nYou know, I think I think\n\n\nRon Stallworth is like, man, they made a movie about my story. That's pretty awesome. And at the very least, it's a pretty great movie. How about that?\nTotally.\nSo, um, if you you got anything else?\nI got nothing else.\nIf you want to know more about BlacKkKlansman, you should probably go see that movie. And I guess we probably should have said at the outset, this episode is not an ad.\nNo, of course not.\nWe just like the movie a lot, right?\nYeah. I mean, you could say it's an ad, but like no one gave us money or asked us to do this.\nSure. Uh, okay.\nBut I am endorsing it.\nOkay, there you go. I am endorsing it as well. It has two thumbs up as it were.\nYeah.\nRest in peace, Roger Eert and Jean Cisco.\nTwo thumbs.\nUh, okay. So, if uh or I already I already said that. How about some listener mail?\nYeah. I'm going to call this pingpong response from a former pro.\nOh, nice.\nHey guys, want to commend you on the job you did covering a sport that you didn't have an extensive uh extensive knowledge of. I'm a professional table tennis coach and former player. I started playing in college. Thought I was really good until I was coerced to go to a tournament at Princeton University about 20 years ago and I got destroyed. I didn't like that. So, I sought out to coach uh and the rest is history. Uh you guys clearly did a lot of research and uh to highlight the things that most novice players aren't aware of, but there were a few things I couldn't help but point out. Uh Josh, you mentioned the components of the modern racket. You said the pimpled sign, those are called pips, are for spinning the ball, that the smooth side is for defensive play, but the opposite is actually true.\nOh, no.\nUm I I didn't catch that because I would have pointed that out. I thought everyone knew that.\nThank you for that. You get good spin on that smooth side. Uh\nfor real?\nOh, yeah.\nYeah. It's grippy.\nAll right.\nUh he said the smooth side is very tacky. Um as in sticky.\nOh.\nAnd that combined with the sponge underneath allows the ball to sink in just enough so that the tacky surface grips the ball and generates a lot of spin. Also, you can have uh really have any combination of rubber that you want as long as it's ITTF approved. Players are not restricted to having one smooth side and one with pips. Uh, but one side does have to be red and the other black.\nUh, most defensive players use pips on their backhand because pips vary the spin that is coming back at you and is very hard to read. Uh, also Chuck, you mentioned that defensive players are called chislers. They're actually called choppers as they chop the ball back with varying backspin. I've never heard the term chislers. I'm wondering if it is extremely outdated.\nMaybe.\nI bet you that was the case.\nYeah, I had old research. Chislas.\nThat's what they call it in the 20s.\nHe said, \"If you guys are ever in the Dunellan, New Jersey area, stop by.\"\nWe're there right now.\nStop by the Lily Yip Table Tennis Club and I'll gladly hook you guys up with a lesson.\nI will gladly humiliate you in person.\nUh and that is Thomas from uh Philly.\nThanks, Thomas. Um much appreciated. We like it when we are gently corrected because we like to be right. So, thanks for that.\nUh, if you want to get in touch with us, let us know um, I don't know, something we got wrong about BlacKkKlansman, let us know.
