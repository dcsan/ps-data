  "cleanText": "[Music]\nWelcome to Stuff You Should Know, a\nproduction of iHeartRadio.\nHey, and welcome to the podcast.\nI'm Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here,\ntoo.\nAnd this is Stuff You Should Know.\nThis is, I guess, a timely topical\ntrue crime edition.\nThe three T's.\nCOA alert.\nYeah, I feel I should sound the clocks\non this one.\nUh, yeah, we're issuing a COA on this one.\nA pretty a pretty robust one because uh, this is\nsomething we don't do a lot, which is\ntackle uh true crime and uh almost real\ntime as far as the fact that none of\nthis has settled uh the alleged crimes.\nWe're probably going to say alleged a\nlot because uh there's not even been\ncourt uh dates a lot of times for some\nof these cases.\nUh, where you know we're\ntalking about potentially six murders in\nthree states by uh a group that may or\nmay not have done it that may or may not\nbe a cult.\nSo just a big COA there.\nUm, this is one of the true crimes where\nlike neither one of us are going to be\nlike, \"well, here's my theory on this,\" cuz\njust who knows this has got to play out\nfirst.\nUh, and the other big COA is a lot of uh\num sort of a disproportionate\namount of members of uh the Zizians who\nwe're going to be talking about are\nmembers of the trans community.\nUh, and\nit's just one of the sort of facts of\nthe case.\nIt's obviously no uh\nsuggestion or judgment on our part of\nthe trans community, but it's it seems\nto be a big sort of part of uh this\ngroup of people who got together.\nSo\njust kind of keep all that in mind as we\nlay all this out there.\nRight.\nNice\nwork, Chuck.\nThank you for that.\nYeah.\nUm, so like you said, we're talking\nabout the Zizians.\nHow did you hear\nabout this?\nThis is your pick.\nYou know\nwhat?\nI have no idea.\nAnd even went to\nlook to see if somebody has suggested\nit.\nNo one had.\nI think I might have\njust seen a news story and been like,\n\"Wait a minute.\nThis is this is\nsomething that hasn't been a 10- part\nNetflix series yet, right?\nSo, it must\nbe super super current.\"\nWhich it is.\nMy\ntheory is that the great Gazoo said, \"Do\none on the Zizians,\" do\nand you were like\nI should do one on the Zizians.\nYeah,\nthanks for bringing a joke into this\nthing.\nSo, uh, the Zizians are called\nsuch because they center around Ziz, um,\na trans woman who is often portrayed as\nthe leader of this cult.\nUh, and I mean,\nyou can make a pretty fair case that at\nthe very least she's the leader or the\nmost influential member because the\nwhole thing's named after her.\nAlthough\nwe should say that this uh group of\npeople do not call themselves the\nZizians.\nThat was a name that was given\nto them by um somebody who's critical of\nthem, an anonymous person who's critical\nof them.\nYeah.\nBut Ziz herself um we\nknow was born in 1991 in Fairbanks,\nAlaska.\nAnd like the other people that\nshe attracts into her orbit, um she was\nbrilliant.\nI mean very precocious as far\nas like working on computers goes, as\nfar as mathematics goes.\nUm, I think by\nthe time she was at uh the University of\nFairbanks in Alaska, she had internships\nat both Oracle, the cloud computing\ncompany, and NASA.\nSo I mean like a like\nshe had a pretty pretty great resume, I\nguess, is what you'd say if you're on\nLinkedIn.\nYeah, for sure.\nAnd like you\nsaid, that's this is going to be sort of\na common thing with everyone who got\ntogether with with Ziz and the others.\nUh, so in college uh Ziz started learning\nabout uh what's called the the\nrationalist movement or the rationalist\ncommunity which were also uh very\nscience-minded people.\nUm, they kind of\ngathered around Silicon Valley.\nAnd one\nof the big things with rationalism is uh\nand a lot of this stuff makes sense like\na lot of the stuff that they're laying\ndown like, \"hey, let's use logical tool\nto tools to to just always question\nourselves.\nLet's let's not get set in\nour way of thinking about anything.\nLet's always revise the what we're\nthinking about everything.\"\nAnd one of\nthe key people here, one of the names\nthat'll you'll hear early and then uh\nlater on is a guy named Eleazar Yudkowski\nwho is an AI researcher who is um kind\nof doing something different than what a\nlot of AI researchers are doing in that\nhe has devoted much of his career to\nbasically saying, \"Hey, warning.\nThis\nthis could really go wrong and I'm going\nto do everything I can to make sure it\ngoes down in the right way.\"\nYeah.\nHe\ndedicated himself to solving the AI\nalignment problem, which is how do you\ncreate an artificial intelligence whose\nmotivations are totally aligned with\nhumans and we don't accidentally wipe\nourselves out with the AI we create.\nYeah.\nUm, and like you said, it kind of\nflies in the face of especially what's\ngoing on these days, which is like, \"hurry\nup and build an AI or else China's going\nto do it first and and we're going to\nlose out and there's so much money to be\nmade off of AI.\"\nUm, and Eleazar Yukowski\nis a very very interesting duties\nself-taught AI researcher incredibly\nbrilliant and just by happenstance I\ngot an email yesterday from uh somebody\nat a publishing house that mentioned\nthat um he has a new book coming out in\nSeptember um with Nate Sorbs, one of his\ncollaborators.\nUm, it's called If Anyone\nBuilds It Everyone Dies and it's about\nAI and from what I understand he's\nthrown in the towel.\nHe's basically said\nit's it's too late.\nYeah.\nUm, we are not\ngoing to be able to create a friendly AI\nbecause not enough people are working on\nit and it's about to happen any day now.\nA super intelligent AI is going to come\nout.\nAnd so we have to figure out how to\nlet humanity die off in the most\ndignified manner is how I saw it\ndescribed, right?\nWhich doesn't have a\nwhole lot to do with the Zizians, but\nthat just sets up kind of who this guy\nis.\nUh, in 2009 he founded a blog uh\ncalled less wrong as in let's do less\nwrong and uh I mean I assume that's what\nit means it means um so it it's about\novercoming your biases like you want to\nbe less wrong uh kind of it's all about\nthinking clearly and not letting your\nbiases guide your thinking I think yeah\nso they um started gathering uh as I\nguess a deacto sort of community of\nrationalists uh a lot of This again is\ntaking place in and around Silicon\nValley and Northern California.\nAnd uh\nhe founded a couple of Berkeley uh\nCalifornia-based organizations um\nthat'll come into play.\nThe machine\nintelligence research institute or MIRI\nuh and again that's about you know\nminimizing the risks of AI and then the\ncenter for applied uh rationality or\nsefar.\nUh, and again, same deal.\nUm,\nclear, unbiased thinking is what they're\nafter.\nNever getting too set in your\nways and always trying to revise how you\nthink about things, right?\nUm, they're\nalso very closely tied with effective\naltruism, which is essentially using\nrational thinking to um donate your\nmoney to the greatest good.\nWe did an\nepisode on on that if I'm not mistaken.\nWe did, my friend.\nAll of this attracted\nZiz to um move from Alaska down to the\nBay Area in San Francisco.\nUm, and she\ngot involved with Sefar, got involved\nwith u Mirie um, and dedicated herself\nalso to trying to figure out this AI\nalignment problem too.\nUm, and she the\nthing about this rationalist community\nis they are as open as you can be.\nYou\ncan be a Nazi and show up and be like,\n\"I'm a Nazi and here's what I think about\neverything.\"\nAnd they will engage you in\ndebate because that's just what they do.\nThey like no thought processes off the\ntable.\nAnd that attracted a lot of\ninteresting people who were would the\naverage normie would probably not\nnecessarily feel comfortable sitting in\na room with just because, you know, of\nawkwardness, but also because they\nprobably wouldn't have much to converse\nabout because the people we're talking\nabout in this rationalist community are\nso brilliant that they probably would\nnot be able to relate to the average\nperson and vice versa.\nYeah.\nOr at the\nvery least on on some of the radical\nfringes of whatever movement that\nthey're in.\nUm, Ziz is one of those\npeople and was uh started writing on the\nthe less wrong side and her own blog and\nwriting about again stuff that's on the\nmore radical end of the spectrum like,\n\"hey, we got to, you know, sort of a uh 12\nmonkeys kind of stuff.\"\nUm, like, \"hey, we\ngot to do whatever it takes.\"\nUh, some\npeople might think, you know, something\nwe're we're doing is evil, but if it's\nin the service of we what we think has a\ngood end, uh, then that's what we should\ndo.\nUm, sometimes she calls herself a\nSith, as in, you know, Star Wars.\nAnd\napparently the name Ziz comes from a\nspeculative fiction story called Worm,\nuh, that a lot of rationalists love, in\nwhich Ziz in the story is a is a\nvillainous entity that if um they're\nlistened to for too long, uh, you will go\ncrazy.\nAnd so Ziz is all of a sudden\nhanging around the Bay Area going to\nthese rationalist uh hangouts and\nmeetings wearing uh black robes as and\nsort of dressed like a Sith.\nSo um all\nthis is what around 2016-17 that this is\nall starting that Ziz is showing up.\nUm,\nand again like I said this community is\nvery open.\nSo even though Ziz would show\nup wearing black robes declaring herself\na Sith um lord and that that's her\nreligion is is Sith, but despite that\ncommunity being open, she still stood\nout not necessarily because she wore\nblack robes and call herself a Sith, but\nmore because she was more intensely\ndevoted and dedicated than even the\naverage rationalist, right?\nSo she did\nstand out some.\nOne of the other things\nthat she was radically dedicated to was\nuh veganism and animal rights.\nAnd this\nwould actually end up separating her\nfrom the rationalist community\neventually.\nAnd that you can kind of\nmake a case it seems like is the initial\nschism that caused this wedge that led\nto all the events that would follow.\nYeah.\nLike basically, \"hey, you're you're\num trying to protect human life.\nLike\nwhat about the animals?\nLike every\nsensient animal is a person.\"\nUh, and\nthat this is these are Ziz's words.\nUh,\nand you know so we gota we got to kick up\nthe uh the intensity on the animal front\nas well.\nUh, the problem with all of this\nis that this was around San Francisco\nand Silicon Valley where it's really\nreally expensive uh to live and uh if\nyou're someone like Ziz, you're you're\nnot uh you know going out and getting\nsome big tech uh job where you're making\ntons of money to afford that condo\ndowntown.\nSo you got to live somewhere.\nAnd this is when Ziz meets up with uh\nsomebody named Gwen Danielson.\nUm, had a\nlot in common, another rationalist,\nanother uh transwoman, another person\nwho was uh very much into animal rights.\nAnd Gwyn happened to live on a sailboat\nin Berkeley Marina and said, \"Hey, this\nis much cheaper rent here.\nWhy don't you\njust come and live on this boat with me?\nI'm also into math.\nI'm also into\nscience.\nAnd I'm also have some pretty\nradical ideas about stuff.\"\nYeah.\nAnd so\nthe point of this was if you, and this\nis um Ziz's um belief, if you could free\nyourself from things like paying rent,\nespecially the high rent of San\nFrancisco, and keep your cost down to as\nminimal as possible, you could devote\nthat much more time to figuring out the\nAI alignment problem, figuring out how\nto push Sefar and Merie into protecting\nanimal rights, too.\nLike just thinking\nand learning to think better.\nUm, that\nwas kind of the the point.\nAnd so I\nthink Ziz initially moved into the\nsailboat with Gwen Danielson, found that\nthey were not quite exactly compatible\nroommate wise, but still friends.\nAnd so\nZiz bought her own sailboat and docked\nit at the same marina in Berkeley.\nAnd\nthey became uh what was called the\nrationalist fleet.\nUm, this they invited\nmore and more people to come join them\nat the marina.\nAnd they actually went so\nfar as to buy an old tugboat that by\nthis time was in its 70s or 80s maybe.\nNot like and not a good age for a\ntugboat.\nAnd they actually bought it\nfrom Alaska and tugged it down or sailed\nit down all the way to San Francisco.\nYeah.\nThe name of this boat was Caleb.\nUh, so now it's in Half Moon Bay, south\nof San Francisco.\nAnd uh Caleb was a\nproblem though.\nCable, like you said,\nwas an old boat, an old World War II era\ntugboat.\nSo, it wasn't like, you know,\neven like a a a mid-70s houseboat would\nhave been a better option probably.\nUm,\nthis thing they couldn't they had a hard\ntime anchoring it.\nUh, it was too\nexpensive to maintain.\nUh, it would\ndrift out of control and hit other\nboats.\nSo, it was not, you know, uh,\neverything they thought it was going to\nbe.\nSo, just, you know, sort of park\nthat for now.\nI'm going to say that a\nlot because we're going to be parking a\nlot of things as this jumps around.\nUh,\nand it's at this point we have to\nintroduce some new characters to the\nscene.\nUm, again had a lot in common with\nZiz and Gwyn.\nUh, in that they were very\nvery smart, very much into math and\nscience.\nUh, some were trans and some\nwere non-binary.\nUh, and the first player\nhere is uh someone named Emma Bannian.\nUh, a programmer worked at Google but\nleft Google because uh they thought the\ncompany was corrupt.\nYes.\nUh, and we should say these people\nfell into Zizz's um, orbit because Ziz\nwas a prolific blogger and blogged in a\nway that like a lot of the language and\nthoughts and and ideas were impenetrable\nto all but a certain group of people and\nthese were the people that she ended up\nattracting through her blog.\nUm, there's\na really great Guardian article about\nall of this written by uh Oliver Conroy\nand um Conroy says that uh there was a\nglossery that somebody gave him that one\nof the one of Zigg's blog followers\ncreated of Zigg's words and that when he\nprinted it out it was 48 pages long.\nSo\num like she had a certain thing going on\nthat attracted a certain kind of person\nand these were the people who were\nfalling into their into her orbit at\nthis time and we should also say all of\nthese people were in their early to\nmid20s.\nUm, I think Ziz was the oldest maybe at\nthe time at 26.\nSo they were all\ndisaffected, brilliant, often trans\nvegan 20somes who were living um very\nclose to homelessness in San Francisco\nin the late 201s.\nYeah.\nSo the second\nperson was Alex Letham uh occasionally\nknown as Somni uh a mathematician in\nthis case um went to UCLA, studied at UC\nBerkeley as well.\nUh then we\n\n\nI have Michelle Zashko, a biometrics researcher, another smarty pants. Uh, and then someone named Alice Monday, who was Zashko's girlfriend and a bit of a mentor, apparently, according to Ziz to Ziz. And they started sort of just getting together, talking about their ideas. Um, they came up with a name for one of their theories, uh, or sort of their overarching theory called vegan anarchhumanism.\n\nUh, and Gwyn Danielson developed this idea that the hemispheres of the brain were basically separate, and they could operate independently from one another. Uh, you can be different genders at the same time. You can be good and evil or good or evil at the same time. And they started these experiments called uni, uh, uni-hemismic sleep, where they were saying you can be asleep and awake at the same time. One can be asleep, and then one can be active and awake. And we say this because there are people that have accused um, Ziz and others in the group of basically, uh, keeping you sleep deprived through these experiments, uh, potentially leading to a couple of suicides that we'll talk about. Uh, and again, I, I have no judgment on whether or not they are a cult or not at this point, but if you're making a case for cult, sleep deprivation is a very big hallmark of something that oftentimes happens. Yeah. That's like chapter two in the cult leaders playbook. Yeah, we should say also that uni hemispheric sleep theoretically is possible. Humans don't do it, but dolphins do, whales do, migratory birds do. So, it's not like it just doesn't exist. It's humans trying to figure out how to do it themselves so they could think longer, more hours in a day, essentially. Yeah. So, this group is getting a little more, uh, upset and aggressive toward the official rationalist movement and community. Um, they think again that Mary and Sefar, uh, you're, you're not doing enough for the animals. Um, you need to expand your, um, I guess, viewpoint on, uh, sentient beings and what that means. And you're also biased against trans people. Yeah. And there was another thing, too, that Ziz got really upset about. She came to believe that Mary paid off a blackmailer. Another way to put it is that somebody accused people at Merie of sexual assault or statutory rape, I think it was, and that they paid the person to go away. Some people would call it a settlement. To Ziz, it was a blackmail, paying off a blackmailer. And that you just did not do that. That that violated some of the basic tenants of the rationalist community and the way of solving problems that they use. So that with the ethical veganism combined really separated her from this rationalist community. And with this growing group around her, they decided that they were going to show up, uh, go to the SEFAR seminar conference that was being held in 2019.\n\nUm, and they were going to present their problems and their issues and in a very rational way, just like Sefar would want them to. And the the people who organized Sefar were like, \"You guys are way too aggressive for our tastes. You can't come to this Seafar retreat.\" And one of them said, \"You've got a Nazi in there.\" Right? So, four of them, uh, Ziz, Gwen Danielson, um, Emma, uh, Bannian, and, and it gets a little confusing with all the names, and Alex Letham, uh, they went anyway, and they had their Guy Fox masks on, and they had their black hooded robes on. They blocked the exits with their vehicles, and they were like, \"Here, you're going to listen to us. Here's our flyers. Here's our problems and our issues.\" And the staff didn't know what was going on. They called in a report of a possible active shooter and the cops came. Uh, they did not have arms on them or anything like that, but they were arrested, uh, on charges of false imprisonment and child endangerment because there were kids there. It was a campground where they met north of San Francisco. Uh, and the defendants, we should point out, the four of them did end up filing a suit um, against the police alleging mistreatment. Yeah. So the rationalist community is like, that's it. Not only can you not come to Sefire retreats, you can't even hang out on the Less Wrong blog. You can't come to our um, uh, cocktail meetups that we have, which are a lot of fun. So, you're probably going to be upset. Um, they've just got booted out. So, now this wedge was a gulf. It was a, it was a break in communication between the the group that would come to be known as Zizians and the rationalist community. And with that, that group became more and more isolated. And their ideas got a little weirder and a little more far out and a little more aggressive because they were all similar people who were feeding off one another in this isolated situation. There weren't people on the outside coming and be like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's, let's rethink what you're saying.\" It was like, \"Yeah, that's a really good idea.\" And it just kept going from there. All right. I think that's a good, uh, you can kind of park all that stuff for now because the story kind of jumps around the country a bit, and when we come back, we're going to pick up with part two a little north of San Francisco in Vallejo, California.\n\n[Music]\n\nStop.\n\nYou know, stop. You should know. No. Stop.\n\nYou know. So, um, Chuck, one of the, uh, outcomes of being like pushed out of the rationalist community, somebody launched a website called Zizians.info.\n\nIt's still around today. And they basically chronicled all the things that they accused the Zizians of being a cult or that backs up their accusation of the Zizians being a cult. And two of the things are something you referenced earlier. There were two um, suicides by people who were um, said to have gone through this uni hemispheric sleep um, I guess boot camp, and it resulted in their, their suicides, allegedly. So, um, the Zizians just have a really bad name at this point. The marina thing is not working out. The rationalist fleet is kind of sinking as it were. And they just happened to meet somebody at the marina named Curtis Lind, who was a 70-something guy who loved people, loved artists, and had a bunch of land down in Vallejo and said, \"Hey, um, I want artists to come live down there. You guys seem kind of artsy and odd. Why don't you come live there for really cheap rent?\" And the Zizians were like, \"Heck yeah.\" All right. So Curtis Lynn offers, uh, you know, them the chance to go live, uh, you know, they paid rent, but I, I don't imagine it very much. And in this, you know, we're going to be introduced to some more players at this point. Um, one of the members of the group that had joined up at this time, her name was, uh, Siri Dao, and she was fresh out of high school and, uh, a leftist blogger, and, uh, just sort of put a pin in this. At one point in a Discord chat, she said that she had had, uh, very dramatic fantasies about becoming a knife murderer. Uh, and there's, you know, up to 20 people at this time on Curtis Lynn's property. Uh, the neighbors get a little freaked out. They're like, \"Hey, they're walking around naked sometimes. They're wearing gas masks.\" Uh, Lind eventually is like, \"You guys aren't even paying rent anymore.\" Uh, and they said, \"Yeah, well, there's a co-eviction moratorum, so what are you going to do about it?\" So everything just starts going really, uh, pear-shaped, as you say, in like 2022. Yeah. Also, Chuck, I saw that they would carry katanas around like samurai swords. So imagine seeing your neighbor walking around naked wearing a gas mask and carrying a samurai sword, and there's 20 of them. It would be hard, especially in the context of California, to not be like, I think they might be a cult. Good point. So, in 2022, um, like you said, things just really start to take a, a terrible shape. In August, Ziz's sister and Emma Banian went to the police and said, \"Uh, our friend Ziz fell over while boating.\" So, Ziz died during in a boating accident. The Coast Guard, um, launched a huge search, and I guess after 18 hours, they said there's no way that she could have survived. And she was, although they didn't have the body, they still declared her legally dead. Um, and her sister was given a death certificate. And around the same time, uh, Gwen Danielson, who was one of the OG members of this whole group, she died by suicide, too. So, this group is just rocked by these two deaths in 2022.\n\nThat's right. So, uh, while this is happening, uh, it's kind of at the same time this COVID, uh, eviction moratorum runs out. So Curtis Lind is like, \"All right, now I can actually um, get these people off my property finally, probably like this November, uh, two days before he was able to do that and sort of drop the news that they were out of there, uh, Siri Dao called, uh, called him in and said, \"Hey, there's a water leak on my property here, uh, or in my trailer. You got to come and check this out.\" Uh, Curtis Lynn says, \"I went to address the issue with the water, and I was assaulted. Uh, they hit me over the head. They stabbed me with knives. They stabbed me with a katana, the samurai sword. Uh, he ended up losing an eye. He was stabbed through the chest. Uh, apparently he, he alleges that Alex Letham was the one who stabbed him through the chest. And so he shot Letham and Emma Bannian and killed her dead. If you ask the the Zizians that were there, they said, \"No, that's not what happened. Um, he'd been harassing us, and he just opened fire on us one day.\" So, um, the authorities tended to agree or believe, uh, Curtis Lind, uh, and in fact, Letham and Dao were arrested, charged with attempted murder, and then also charged with, um, the death of Emma Bannian because apparently in California law, if you do something that causes the death of somebody else, even incidentally, um, you are responsible or you can be held responsible for that death. And the thinking was that Curtis Lynn had to kill Emma Bannonian because of the actions of Dao and Letham. Right. Right. So now Siri Dao and, uh, Alex Letham are in jail in California. That's where they are. So just park that, like you said. That's right. So, uh, police, uh, took another member of the group, um, at the time. Uh, she gave her name as Julia Dawson. They said, \"Come down the station with us. We got to question you.\" Mhm. Uh, at the station, she seemed like she was having a medical emergency. So, they're like, \"Well, we got to get her to the hospital.\" Stat, uh, took her to the hospital, and she disappeared from the hospital. Detectives started investigating, uh, what happened there, and they said, \"Oh, you know who that was? That was Ziz. Ziz is not dead at all.\" And they also determined, guess who else was there? Gwen Danielson. Uh, she's actually alive as well. Yeah. So, if you've heard our faking your death episode, this is a, it's a big deal to fake your death, especially successfully. So, the Zizians never thought they were dead. If they did, it was for a very short time. It was to protect themselves from the authorities. One of the other things that was really a, an unsettling find after Curtis Lind was attacked, um, they found a, a vat of lie that suggested that they intended to kill him and that they were going to dissolve his body in it. So, um, it's starting to become clear, like these people are no joke. But at the time, this was like a, a, an isolated incident. It wasn't related to anything else. The, the authorities did not know that this was a group known as the Zizians or anything like that. This, there were pieces that were starting to lay out on the table, but no one had put them together yet. Yeah, exactly. Um, all right. So, now you can park all of that because we're going to move once again across the country. Uh, this time Pennsylvania is going to come into the picture, uh, in 2021. So, this is, you know, a little bit before these events. Uh, Michelle, uh, Zashko that we mentioned and Alice Monday, who were, uh, girlfriends with each other. They moved from California to Vermont to Northern Vermont, pretty rural area, and they were joined by a guy named Daniel Blank, another like-minded person. He went to UC Berkeley, uh, bioengineering and electrical engineering code, uh, and then worked at startups, and he was also a vegan and, um, started to sort of get a little more radical about it. Uh, got distanced from his parents, started judging them for eating meat. Um, and he hooks up with Monday and Zashko in Vermont. Yeah. And so by this time, I think, I don't know if you said it or not. I think you did. Um, Ziz had credited Alice Monday as being like her mentor. Yeah. Um, she had, she modeled herself largely after Alice Monday, too. Like she was apparently really assertive with her beliefs and ideas, and Ziz became more and more like that after meeting Alice Monday. By this time, though, she considered Alice Monday, uh, an enemy, what she called a vampire. And I guess Zajko was by, by association, guilty by association. And from what I could tell, they, Alice Monday became her enemy because she and maybe Zashko were warning people away from Ziz, saying like, you need to steer clear of this person. So, Ziz considered them enemies, and she contacted Zajko and said, \"Hey, um, if you want to earn my trust back, you need to murder Alice, and if you don't, I'm going to come to Vermont and murder you.\" And this was the kind of a precarious situation as, as far as, um, Zashko was concerned, Michelle Zajko was concerned because, and this really, I think, kind of gets a lot across. She was like, I really had to kind of decide, you know, did I want to murder Alice to make Z\n\n\nIs happy, or should I kill Ziz?\nThis is the position that Ziz was putting people in by this time.\nAllegedly.\nYeah.\nShould we just have Jerry drop in the word allegedly like just every 40 seconds?\nAllegedly.\nBeijing, Mr. Herman.\nUh, I know I promised Pennsylvania, and we've been in Vermont for a second here, but here's where Pennsylvania comes into play.\nUh, uh, December 31st, uh, last day of the year, according to many, in 2022.\nThis is about a month and a half after Curtis Lind was stabbed and after that all occurred in Viejo.\nSo, Michelle Zazco's parents, Richard and Rita, were murdered in Pennsylvania.\nUh, they have ring camera footage from a neighbor that shows two people arriving at the house a little before midnight.\nAnd on the camera footage, you can hear, uh, what sounds like mom, and then a few seconds later, oh my god.\nOh, God.\nGod.\nAnd the parents of Michelle Zashko were found shot in the head, uh, kind of execution style in their bedroom.\nYeah.\nSo, the Pennsylvania state troopers went to go visit Michelle Zajko in Vermont, and she's like, \"I haven't been to Pennsylvania in almost 20 years or more than 20 years.\nI haven't talked to my parents in a year, so it's not me.\nI don't know who killed them.\"\nAnd in fact, she showed up, um, to a graveside service a couple weeks later, uh, and I believe was the sole beneficiary maybe of her parents' estate.\nUm, while she was there for the service, she, uh, was accompanied by Daniel Blank, and I guess they had drawn some attention at the hotel because they were both wearing black, and one of them was said to have been carrying a gun around the hotel grounds.\nSo, the hotel called the police, and the police started surveilling them.\nAnd after a very short time, they, um, went into Michelle Zajko's hotel room and searched it.\nAnd I think they searched your car, found something like $40,000 in cash, and they were like, \"Yeah, we're just going to take you down to jail.\nAll this stuff is kind of mounting.\nWe still think you might have killed your parents.\nWe're going to take you in for questioning.\"\nAnd she said something to the hotel person that was there said, \"Can you contact Daniel Blank?\nHe's in another room here and tell him what's going on.\"\nAnd the police were like, \"I think we'd like to talk to him, too.\"\nWent and got a warrant, and then they went to Daniel Blank's room shortly after that.\nThat's right.\nUh, they detained him.\nUh, they did not, uh, were not able to keep them for very long.\nThey were released pretty quickly.\nUh, but we should mention, too, in addition to that 40 grand in cash, they also found several prepaid cell phones, which is a bit of a potential red flag as well in Michelle Zashko's car.\nAnd while they were arresting Blank, there was someone else in the room.\nUh, they were lying on the floor.\nThey wouldn't move.\nThey wouldn't speak.\nAnd that was, drum roll, Ziz.\nUh, so Ziz is getting around at this point.\nUh, police arrested Ziz on obstruction of justice, uh, disorderly conduct, I guess, just for not, you know, complying, I guess, and getting off the floor and, uh, stuff like that.\nUm, it was a misdemeanor charge, but, uh, they did hold her in jail for five months, uh, instead of, or I guess in lieu of a $500,000 bail, which just could not afford, obviously.\nAnd the judge said, \"All right, we're going to release you.\nYou got to, uh, promise to pay 10 grand if you miss court.\"\nUh, she did return to court for that August hearing, uh, in a wheelchair pushed by her mom, but when the trial date came up of December of 2023, she did not show up.\nUh, so I think that's probably a great place for our second break because the story is really heating up now.\nSure is.\n[Music]\nStop.\nYou, you know, stop.\nYou should know.\nNo.\nStop.\nYou, you know.\nAll right.\nSo, now we're going to find ourselves partially in North Carolina, uh, and back in Viejo, and also back in Vermont.\nAnd we're going to introduce, uh, what, I guess, three more people.\nUh, Olivia Bakult, Maximillian Snyder, and Milo Young Blute.\nYeah.\nUm, so, Aphilia Bakol, uh, was German by birth.\nUh, and she was described as naive, altruistic, and trusting by friends.\nShe, uh, fell into Ziz's orbit, I think, by starting out reading her blog.\nUm, she was trans.\nShe was a math genius, and she was really, really interested in effective altruism.\nI think she made a couple hundred grand a year as a, um, a quant trader in New York and donated all but 10% of it to effective altruism causes.\nSo she was very dedicated to this.\nBut something about Ziz's philosophy grabbed her, and she ended up leaving New York one day, cutting off all contact with everyone else in her former life and moving to North Carolina and essentially starting a new life in this orbit of Ziz.\nYeah.\nSo, Maxmillian Snyder was, uh, a data scientist, another super, super smart person, and Milo Younglute, uh, went to an elite private school in Seattle, uh, with Maxmillian Snyder, and they got together later on after that.\nAnd in May of 2024, uh, Young Blute's parents said they're, they're missing.\nUm, I don't know where they went.\nThey and Snyder applied for a marriage license together in November of 2024, which is, uh, November 5th specifically, which is Guy Fox night.\nMhm.\nAnd apparently they all got attracted to the Zizians just through online.\nThey never met Ziz.\nThey never met Gwen Danielson.\nThey never met any of the other, uh, rationalist fleet Zizians at all in person.\nYes, that seems to be contested from what I can tell, Chuck, that there's, um, it's possible that there's evidence that they did meet them, but I, I don't know who said what or why, but that's, yeah, that's a contested issue.\nSo, um, in January of 2025, Jungl Bakol, they're in Vermont, they're a short distance away from Michelle Zajo's, um, house.\nSo, um, shortly after the move where everybody was in, um, Chapel Hill, Young Blute and Bakolt, um, traveled to Vermont, and they stay, they checked into a hotel that was not too far from Michelle Zashko's house.\nAnd, um, I thought initially that they were there to kill Michelle Zashko, but I found that they, uh, had made contact with her enough that the police think that she bought them some guns or gave them some guns that she bought.\nUm, I'm not exactly sure what they were doing in Vermont, but they were eventually, they fell under the radar of the Border Patrol, who, um, pulled them over near the Canadian border.\nAnd when that happened, they were pulled over.\nUh, at the very least, Young Blute, uh, allegedly got out and just opened fire on the Border Patrol agents.\nYeah.\nThey, the Border Patrol said that Bakold attempted to draw a gun.\nUh, they fired back.\nIt's basically a firefight at this point.\nAnd, uh, Buckold and a Border Patrol agent named David Maland were both killed.\nUh, Younglute was injured, uh, arrested, obviously, on assault charges.\nUh, police found hollowpoint ammunition in their car, found, uh, those burner phones wrapped in foil.\nThey found full-face respirator mask.\nThey found a night vision moninocular.\nSo, it's sort of the mayhem starter kit in the car.\nSure sounds like it for sure.\nSo, yeah.\nAgain, I'm not sure what they were doing in, in traveling from North Carolina to Vermont.\nUm, but this was a, this was a big deal, and they killed a border patrol agent.\nEspecially, um, when a pair of trans, uh, people dressed in all black just opened fire on a border patrol agent and made national news, and this is when, um, people started to connect the dots.\nNot only did you have the attack of Curtis Lind, um, a couple years later, as everybody's starting to go to trial, Siri Dao and, um, Alex Leam are moving toward trial.\nUm, Curtis Lind is a star witness.\nUm, I guess allegedly to shut him up.\nMaxmillian Schneider shows up in Viejo and murdered Curtis Lind before he could testify.\nYeah.\nAnd this was just three days before this shootout in Vermont.\nSo, it's all really coming to a head very quickly and almost real time to where we are today.\nUh, so on February 16th of this year, uh, three people dressed in all black driving a couple of white box trucks, um, all, all of a sudden we're in Maryland.\nThey went to Maryland, uh, to a property owner and said, \"Hey, can we camp out here for a month?\"\nHe did not, uh, take kindly to that.\nSo, he called the cops, and it turns out that was, uh, Daniel Blank, uh, Ziz, and Michelle Zajko.\nAnd they arrested them initially on trespassing charges.\nUh, but they found a bunch of guns in the trucks and said, \"Oh, wait.\nThese are the three people that, like you said, they started really connecting the dots at this point in February.\"\nYeah.\nAnd I couldn't find out what Michelle Zashko or Daniel Blankro wanted for, but Ziz was wanted for jumping, um, bail for that court case in Pennsylvania.\nWell, they were arrested for trespassing.\nYeah, but I don't know what they were wanted for already is what I'm saying.\nSo, that was February.\nUh, as of May, late May, last month, a couple weeks ago, a couple days ago even, you could say, um, Ziz, Michelle Zajko, and Daniel Blank are all in jail in Maryland for trespassing.\nUm, Letham, Dao, and Snyder are all in jail in California for the attack on Curtis Lind and then the murder of Curtis Lynn.\nAnd then Young Blute is in Vermont for allegedly trying to draw a gun on the Border Patrol agents during a firefight where a border patrol agent was killed.\nSo the, um, the Zizians are still, like, around, essentially.\nThey still will say, like, we're not a cult.\nWe're not even called Zizians.\nBut now there's more and more journalists who are starting to dig into it and putting together, um, deeper and deeper profiles of this group and what was going on.\nBut like you said, this is real time, man.\nThis is, there's no resolution to this.\nThis, this is, this is where it stops because this is as far as it's gotten so far.\nYeah.\nUh, they're still writing, apparently Daniel Schneider in jail is writing stuff to the rationalist group saying, uh, hey, like you still need to focus on animal rights.\nAnd Michelle Zajko is writing, she wrote an open letter to the world, uh, that's in quotes, stated March 9th of this year, and where she was like, \"Hey, I didn't kill my parents.\nUm, Ziz hasn't done anything wrong.\nUm, a lot of these people, like, I don't even know those other people.\nI'm not with Maximleian Schneider.\nLike, I've never met these people.\nThey're not, um, Zizians aren't a group.\"\nLike Josh said.\nWell, she didn't say like Josh said.\nThat'd be kind of fun though.\nUm, but they're not even associated with us as a group that we don't refer to ourselves as Zizians, right?\nSo, Alice Monday and Gwen Danielson are thought to be alive still.\nAlice Monday I saw is, um, thought to be in hiding, that she's very scared of Ziz and the Zizians, especially now.\nUm, and then there's other people, there's people in the rationalist community who were willing to speak to journalists about this, but not, not like anonymously because they're scared of the Ziz, too.\nSo it's still a thing, even though Ziz is in jail.\nUm, and it's just a question of where it goes from here.\nUh, but just to kind of wrap everything up, we'll go back to Half Moon Bay where the Caleb was docked in, uh, the Berkeley Marina, and, uh, since the Zizians abandoned it, it has sunk in the marina, half sunk, and is a nuisance to have that you have to get around now.\nPoor Caleb.\nYeah, Caleb's like, \"What did I ever do?\"\nYeah, I just wanted to help people.\nI'm a born tugboat.\nI know.\nUh, if you want to know more about this stuff, go look it up.\nThere's a lot of stuff to read.\nUm, and, uh, just keep an eye on the news.\nWe definitely will be, too.\nAnd since I said that, I think it's time for listener mail, Chuck.\nUh, this is from James.\nUh, hey guys, I'm fascinated that terms we take for granted often come from slurs meant to suppress and in some cases similar slurs.\nI love knowing that pagan came from a word that, as Chuck puts it, means bumpkin.\nUh, it was meant to belittle and diminish, and now it covers a huge chunk of the faith pie.\nUh, I was reminded of the word jaywalking.\nI feel like we've talked about this in something.\nMaybe the origins of jaywalking.\nMaybe, maybe, uh, as cars became a thing and started driving with some velocity in the places where people were used to walking.\nBig car had to make sure they weren't the bad guy.\nThey had to rewrite convention and get people, uh, pedestrians specifically, off the road.\nSo what did they do?\nSlurs, obviously.\nUh, if I remember correctly, J, like, uh, Paganis meant an uneducated country folk too stupid not to walk in the road like a dingus.\nUh, this word must have worked because now it is a legal term to describe the act of crossing a street at a non-crosswalk.\nBig car one, Constantine won.\nThanks for the potting, guys, and for filling my brain with stuff.\nThat is James.\nUh, thanks a lot, James.\nThat's a good one.\nAnd, uh, I think you jogged my memory to an episode about, like, how cars became the dominant mode of transportation in the US.\nSounds like that might have been the one.\nI think that was, that was a good one.\nThat
