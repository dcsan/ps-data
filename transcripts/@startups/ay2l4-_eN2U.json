Uh, for the press and everybody wanting to aggregate my opinion on uh recent events on X uh with some friends of mine and the president. I am going to demure Alex from commenting cuz all that's going to do is get aggregated. Friend of says X, Y, and Z. Uh yeah, my opinion doesn't matter. This this falls under the the umbrella though, Jason, of your kind of 72-hour Trump we've talked about on the show a number of times. So, wait a little bit and see what happens. Uh, I'll I'll just I I said this before we started, but I'll just say this. It was once again a very interesting and fun day on X, and I have not had that much fun on social media in some time. So, I do appreciate everyone providing uh the popcorn for us. But Jason, we have a lot to get to in the startup realm. And I thought we'd start with a couple of updates uh from Wednesday's show. Some big things have happened, and I just want to make sure we kind of close the loop on a couple stories. Let's do it. First up, Circle, the American stable coin company, previously a startup, tried to go public via spa back in the day, went public this week, and I got to say, I am blown away by the results. For folks who don't recall, it was initially looking at a 24 to $26 per share range. Jason, back up on up to 27, 28. Went out at 31, and then it opened at 69, closed yesterday at $83 per share, and then today it closed at $107.70. And what I'm blown away by, Jason, is just the scale of the the the growth in value here. I mean, I'm I've never seen an IPO of this scale go up so quickly so much. Like I I it's it's mind-blowing to me. Bullish for IPOs, bullish for stable coins, bullish for crypto. Seems like a big win. But I wanted to ask you, if you were an investor in this company and it listed at 31, um how peeved would you be that it didn't price higher? This is a classic issue. You know, when you do an IPO, you're offering the public to buy shares in the company. The public bought shares in the company at $31 a share and then the market price for the shares is now $100 or apparently 107. So this means and it was 25x overs subscribed. What this means is they left $70 per share on the table. So, if they raised $1 billion, they could have raised roughly three times that, four times that almost, um, if they had priced at $100 a share. Now, it's hard to know that that was going to happen, but with 25 times the demand for the shares, you did know that this was going to really ramp up. And this is where having an auction for shares or a direct listing of a small number of shares without raising money is a better option. So what's a direct listing? You put the shares up, but you're not selling any shares at that time. You're just saying, \"Hey, the shares can trade.\" Then you make an offering, right, Alex? And so Spotify, when they went public, they just went public. They started trading the shares. And um that if they wanted to raise money, they would do it later when they got the market clearing price. If Circle had done that, they probably could have issued their shares at $50 to $100 a share, you know, later this week. So, they did leave money on the table, but I think this is like a moment in time. This shows to me two things, actually three. Number one, Jeremy is an incredible entrepreneur. He builds real businesses. I've known him through three different businesses, Breite Cove, etc. And he's just been one of these, you know, incredible, you know, entrepreneurs with a long track record. So, number one, Jeremy is what this is about. Number two, it's about crypto regulation. So, uh, David Sachs, the Zar of crypto, uh, and SEC and this administration want to make clear rules. Under Gary Gensler, it was, you know, our way or the highway. Unclear. I think people were, you know, unlikely to go public because they were a little bit nervous. What if it gets unwound? And so, in fact, Circle was going to go out via Spa 2 years ago, 3 years ago. They chose not to, I think, because of the regulatory environment. So, that's number two is the crypto regulatory environment. Number three is public markets. Uh, you know, there's not enough opportunity for the dollar. So, everybody wants to own the Mag 7. Everybody wants to own, you know, these great companies, you know, that are right behind the Mag 7, Coinbase, Robin Hood, Uber, Door Dash, you know, that Airbnb, that whole cohort, let's call it the class of uh 2010. Sure. And um yeah, pent up market demand for uh you know, these products. And so we had Coreweave and Cororeweave has done pretty well post uh IPO. I believe that their their stock has run up as well and eToro as well has done well post IPO price. So I mean the way that I framed this was it's three for three for technology IPOs this year in the US and they seem to be doing increasingly well which is very, very bullish. But for the for the nerds out there, Jason, who are really into crypto, I I came up with a new useless metric, which is, okay, what percentage of USDC circulating stable coins is uh circle now worth? And it turns out they have about 61 billion in circulating USDC stable coins and their market cap is now about 20 billion, which means that they're valued at about .3 stable coin AUM as a ratio. And that's actually high. Yeah, that is actually a very interesting metric because what you're saying is how they they don't own those that value, right? The the value of the stable coins is money that was given to them that they have put on chain that they own treasuries for. But by doing a percentage, the market cap is hey, how much could we value what's the value of those stable coins of those deposits essentially? Sure. So the deposits are making four or 5% a year. So that you're giving them credit for six years worth of, you know, revenue coming in, but they split it with some of the markets where they're at. So maybe it's really like net two or three points. So you're giving them in that case if it was net two, you're giving them like 10 years or 20 years of revenue. Credit uh yeah, that does seem extremely high. Obviously, it's overvalued right now. Like Palenter is all overvalued. You do have these moments. Um, that doesn't mean I would short the stock. It just means this would not be the entry price where I would buy in if I was making a trade. Yeah. Um, and you know, these things happen. Things spike up in value when there's scarcity and there is scarcity. Coreweave is probably another one of those where I don't know what their price to sales ratio is right now um or their earnings, but you know, price to sales is a pretty good way to look at these businesses. And you you really do need to look at these crypto businesses with a fresh fresh metrics and fresh eyes. The the problem with stable coins or the thing to be aware of is they are dependent on the return rate of treasuries, of bonds, of whatever devices they're putting that money in very predictable four or 5%. What if it goes down to 1% again? What if it goes down to 2%. Yeah. Or zero. I mean, we were zero for a long time. It's it's interesting to me and this is just inside baseball, but currently Jerome Powell over at the Fed by not cutting rates is really throwing a huge bone over to Jeremy and and Circle. And by the way, if you want more from Jeremy Allaire, uh we had him on TWiST500 episode 2004, Jason, that was September 6th, 2024. Really fun chat with them in a kind of pre-IPO context if you want to go back a little bit. Correct. Uh yeah, I think you're dead on though about crypto regulations and regulatory kind of certainty being key here because we also saw today this afternoon that Gemini announced that they have filed privately to go public. If you don't know Gemini, it's kind of like Coinbase, kind of like Kraken. It's a consumer crypto exchange. Does a lot of business probably best known, Jason, for having the Winklevoss twins behind it. Uh they're best known for their early Facebook era, but they've really had a crypto second act, if you will. Now, we don't have any numbers here because this is a confidential filing, but they made noise about it, which gives a lot more credence to them actually going out because in March, we heard they were preparing a filing privately, but it wasn't really from the company. It was more like, you know, the journal and Bloomberg and such, but now they're really pushing forward. And I'm not shocked to see this drop right after we saw Circle do so well. Clearly, they were watching this and hoping that it was going to go well to push the button.\n\nAll right, we all know if you're a founder or even if you're in a small business, you're thinking about your company 24/7, 365 days a year. That's the life of a founder. This is not clock in, clock out, 9 to 5 gig for you as the business owner. So when you're hiring, you want a partner that's as equally as committed as you are. And that's of course LinkedIn Jobs. LinkedIn Jobs is like your co-founder. They're going to make it so simple for you to post your jobs for free on LinkedIn where there are 1 billion members. You're going to be able to share what you're posting and actually keep all the promising candidates organized in one place. And also, LinkedIn is going to help you quickly write a job and get it in front of the right people, whether you want to post for free or use some promotion to get it in front of even more qualified applicants. So, do me a favor. Don't take my word for it. I mean, you should kind of know what I'm talking about. is where I find my great people. But just understand that 72% of small businesses using LinkedIn said that it helped them find the best candidates. So find out why more than 2.5 million small businesses already use LinkedIn for hiring. So here's your call to action. Post your job for free. Why wouldn't you do it? It's free. Fr. That's a good price. linkedin.com/twist. Once again, that's linkedin.com/twist to post your job for free. Terms and conditions do apply, but we could see another pretty big IPO here in the States. So, I I'm just feels great. Yeah, it's great. You know, I think these marketplaces have shown that there is a market for people who want to trade stocks, cryptocurrency, other financial devices, shorts, whatever. Obviously, I'm a long-term shareholder of Robin Hood. Never sold a share in it. And I think it broke $70 a share. It's at all-time high right now. 74.88. It's worth 66 billion, which actually leads me to my question for you because Coinbase is currently worth 64 billion, which sets up a really funny split screen between those two companies. Now, they started off different places. Robin Hood was zerocost consumer trading of equities that moved into crypto. Coinbase, of course, started off with a cryptobase and it's been moving into other products as well, but they're worth the same now in terms of their market cap. So, if you had a dollar, which one would you pick? Yeah, I mean, I'm I'm team Robin Hood, but these are, you know, great contemporary. So, you might be looking at a, you know, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta kind of situation here. These are all great companies. I don't know enough about Gemini to know if it's a great company like Robin Hood or Coinbase. I I don't suspect it's as good as those companies yet. You know, what makes Robin Hood very special is Vlad is an incredible product guy who keeps adding products to the mix. And so I think they have, you know, many different products, including their credit card, which now has millions of people on the wait list. I have never sold a share. We distributed those shares from our first fund at, I think, 12 or $14 a share. I probably should have held those shares and distributed them like two years later and distributed half and half because then we would have gotten credit for you know on our books but I you know I did tell everybody when we distributed them I'm not selling just as a one piece of data for you and making your decision and then people who were LPs in that fund I talked to a couple of them who didn't sell and you know that's a four or 5x difference right more you 5x difference six 6x difference that would have made that fund which was close to 5x on paper and 1.\n\n\n2 or 3x DPI already, and there's still a bunch of different assets in that first fund of mine.\nI think it would make the fund like maybe double that, right?\nLike, and so, you know, this is, um, the nature of venture, but these things going public, when you see all these companies go public, what you're seeing is a bunch of venture capitalists get their wings, you know, um, and a bunch of LPs get distributions, and then it's up to the people who are LPs in these funds to decide if they keep them or not.\nI wouldn't sell a share of Robinhood ever.\nI mean, I think the amount of assets they have under management and the way they keep releasing great features to me makes it a huge winner.\nStable coins, you...\nWe saw Uber.\nDaro was talking about maybe having stable coins for uh currency fluctuations between their different markets.\nSo I think the idea would be, you know, if they have dollars in South America, in Europe, in euros, etc., in Japan, wherever, you know, do you keep them in yen, or do you move them into stable coins?\nDo you move it into dollars at some point?\nAnd this will reinforce the value of the US dollar.\nSo, we're going to see many more IPOs, and I'm hoping the regulatory frameworks around crypto continue to become really tight and regulated tightly so that we don't have people losing their money.\nI was just in Singapore, as you know, and um, I'm talking to a lot of people in Dubai, Singapore about the possibility.\nMhm.\nThat venture funds will become tokenized.\nUh, so, Jason, tokenizing a Venture Capital fund, what would that look like in practice?\nLet's say we have a $10 million fund.\nIt's a, you know, Alex's first fund.\nAnd I decide I'm going to put a million dollars into it.\nAnd Mike Cavino decides he's going to put a million dollars into it.\nDavid Sax puts a million in.\nChimath puts a million in, etc.\nSo, you got 10 people each own a million.\nLet's say one of those people says, you know what, um, Alex has done great.\nHe invested in Robinhood.\nAnd it's, you know, we think this has, we think the value of his fund went from 10 million and the Robinhood shares have gone up 50x, and Robinhood makes up 10% of the fund.\nTherefore, it's like a 5x fund on paper.\nI'm willing to sell you my million dollars in that fund knowing that million represents 10% of the fund's Robinhood holdings.\nAnd I'm just going to write down all the rest of the holdings or put those at zero.\nBut there's a winner in the fund.\nSo, I'm going to sell my million-dollar position, which is going to be worth, you know, whatever.\nYou could debate it, but let's say 5 million.\nUh, I'll sell it to you for four or three.\nWell, we have that Destiny publicly trading open-end or closed end fund that has SpaceX in it, right?\nAnd every time SpaceX news comes out, if people want to have access to it, they buy that Destiny fund because it's a quick way to instantly get access to it.\nWell, then it would be a way if I had Uber in that first fund or Robinhood or whatever it is from Breakout, those people could, you know, maybe cash in some chips, and then people who wanted access to that pre that early stage fund, that early stage startup could get in, and it would then create a market for and a market clearing price for a fund, which would then mean I'd have to release a little bit more data, or people would have to be more speculative, and then I would have to put some rules on it, like I need to approve who that LP is, or we need to know who that LP is, and they need to, I don't know, be an American citizen, or, you know, uh, have a certain net worth, or we have to have their driver's license.\nWe have to know they're not on a terrorist watch list.\nWe have to know our customer KYC, right?\nSo there have to be some rules of the road.\nBut if anybody out there is working on this, um, you know, it's, it's not clear on regulations who can do this in the world, but there are definitely markets where people could do it.\nSo you have to be thoughtful about it is the end of it is the long story.\nIt's so interesting to me because I see a couple of things that could get a little silly.\nLike, for example, let's say that the fund hasn't called all of its LP capital yet, but I'm an LP and I want to sell my theoretical allocation of the total fund.\nCan that only happen after all the capital calls?\nBecause then I could sell my interest and then not do my later capital calls and wiggle out, and that would get a little dicey.\nBut my my question is that would have to be in the smart contract, right?\nThat if you haven't completed it, you could only sell interest in the smart contract of the called capital.\nSo if you had a million and you had 500k called, you could only sell that 500k.\nYou couldn't sell the other 500.\nThis to me seems a little bit complex when we have venture capital funds that are already publicly traded like Molten Ventures over in the UK.\nYeah.\nWhich shows that you can have a more liquid valuation set on a venture firm at the...\nWhat are they selling when that company's public?\nAre they selling the management fees and the returns to the uh GPs?\nI think that's what they're selling.\nI think it's actually the assets, but I'll I'll double check that and get back to us on Monday because I haven't actually looked into Molten for a couple years, so I'm a little out of date.\nBut it is that is one way to go about this.\nI always get a little concerned people want to tokenize something, Jason, because it sometimes can be a little bit more complexity than value.\nBut if you're talking about it with that many people, I presume this through.\nI think it's the next big innovation in Venture Capital would be, you know, if venture funds are going to exist for 15 years as opposed to just like, you know, 10 to 12, because that, you know, then maybe it would be good that they could trade.\nSo maybe you can't trade them until year five, but, you know, years six on you could.\nSo then you could leave the fund open for 20 years and allow people to trade in and out of it.\nSo, if you had Stripe in there and you were a 13-year investor in Stripe, 14-year investor in Stripe, or 12-year investor in Uber, 13-year investor in SpaceX, you wouldn't have to do secondary transactions of selling the shares.\nYou would just sell the share in the fund, and people would know the fund has this in it.\nI think it would also be fun for there to be like, I would take that fund and I would have all of our holdings be public, and I would release like quarterly statements maybe of those companies and what we've invested in.\nSo it'd be kind of like an index fund where, you know, I told you I bought that KD depth, the Korean defense fund, and boy, that's up like 30%, and you know, I bought like a quarter million dollars worth of it just because I bought Korean defense fund.\nThat sounds interesting.\nOh wow.\nAll right, founders, I know you got a lot on your plate.\nRunning a company means you have endless tasks.\nYou're juggling priorities all while trying to hit your KPIs, right?\nYou got to keep the train moving.\nAnd that's why I love Coda.\nIt keeps my world under control.\nIt's the all-in-one platform, and it's going to consolidate all your documents, all your spreadsheets, and most important to me, apps into a single scalable workplace.\nThe user interface in the product's amazing.\nI use it for something like twist500.com and for Founder University.\nIt's intuitive.\nIt's powerful, and it's going to make all your workflow seamless.\nIt gets stronger by the day.\nCoda empowers your startup to strategize, plan, and track goals effectively.\nSo take advantage of this limited time offer just for startups listening to This Week in Startups.\nYou're going to go to coda.io/twist and get six months free of the team plan.\nOnce again, that's cooda.io/twist to get started for free and get six months of the team plan for f your favorite price.\nYes, it's done.\nI think I bought it at $28 a share and it's at 36 or something.\n37, and it's up a total of 74% so far this year if you bought it at January 1.\nThat's incredible.\nYeah, I I bought it like whatever, three or four months ago.\nI think people are starting to realize that like defense contractors outside the US are going to do quite well.\nUm, you know, and there's there's a bunch of them.\nAnyway, that's this is my thinking is like there's going to be some very interesting opportunities, and then maybe the ability to tap into markets where, you know, somebody's sitting on a billion dollars of crypto, 100 million in crypto, but they say, you know what, I want to slowly move my crypto wealth over to startups, over to real estate.\nI'm not in the real estate game, but if somebody was in the real estate game and they tokenized, you know, their thousand apartments they owned across the US in a a real estate trust or something, and it was tokenized and you could buy in and out of it, that person could then use different coins to buy it, or they could get loans against their coins to buy into it.\nSo, there could be some very interesting ways that money could flow.\nUh, and even programmatically, maybe you say, you know, I just as my crypto wealth grows, I want to move 10% of it into startups.\nSo if my bitcoin, if I got 100 million in bitcoin and I bought it at 50k and now it's 100k, it's worth 200 million, okay, that 10% that was 100, 10 million of the 100 million is now 20.\nI wanted to automatically buy into and buy more shares of these venture funds or real estate funds so that I day in that, you know, private asset, alternative asset world more balanced, right?\nSo, you can do interesting programmatic things.\nOh, I just want to say I'm so blown away that I've heard you say both tokenization and programmatic on the same show without you casting dispersions on crypto.\nI've also come around a little bit on crypto in the last 12, 18 months.\nIt does seem to be these companies are maturing.\nUm, I'm just glad we're we're past the the NFT boom and kind of some of the silliness.\nWhere there's utility, there's value.\nWhere there's value, there's business.\nI'm fine with that.\nAll right.\nUm, let's keep moving on.\nSo, on Wednesday, um, we talked a little bit about Wind Surf, the coding service.\nThey got cut off by Anthropic, and they threw a very polite public fit about it, saying, &quot;Hey, we want to give them money.\nWe want to use their models.\nThey've cut us off.&quot;\nAnd what we didn't have at that point in time, Jason, was Anthropic's response.\nThe good news is that we now do, and the gist is that they want to basically work with people for the long term, and because OpenAI is broadly expected to be purchasing Windsurf, that deal hasn't closed, oddly.\nI don't know what's going on there.\nIt's a little weird that everyone's been talking about it for this long and it hasn't reached the sign dotted line yet.\nUm, but they're basically saying we're not going to let an open AI thief use our stuff.\nSo it is what we thought.\nIt was a competitive point.\nBut I just think that it underscores platform risk for sure, foundation AI model companies in a way that I don't think people were thinking about before.\nBut as Anthropic as OpenAI develop their own cloud code and codeex tooling, there could come a time when they don't want to serve competing companies that are building on top of them.\nAnd I I wonder if Anthropic is going to regret this decision later because it's poisoning the well a little bit for commercial AI models.\nIn my view, I think what's actually happening here is that there was probably an auction, and Anthropic had the chance to buy Windsor, and they didn't clear the bid, and they said, &quot;Okay, well, if we were the home team and we helped you get here and OpenAI is out bidding us, well, we reasonably need to uh not empower you, and we have this like one chance to extract some pain from our suffering that we didn't get to buy the company.\nSo, we're going to do it.\nYou know, it's a like there maybe a little bitterness from Anthropic that they weren't a...\nThis is all speculation.\nSpeculation.\nI...\nThis is...\nYeah, don't reblog.\nI don't have inside information here.\nI'm I'm literally just speculating on what typically happens, right?\nThe board of Windsurf obviously would do their diligence and their duty to all shareholders by creating a marketplace.\nIf OpenAI was part of the acquisition marketplace, so was Google, so was Grock, so was, you know, Microsoft and obviously Anthropic and Amazon.\nSo they all had a chance at buying this.\nI'm certain.\nAnd probably Anthropic was like, you know what, this Jared Kaplan, who's the chief science officer, was like, yeah, their value comes from our model or some significant comes from our model.\nSo what are we doing here?\nYou know, and uh, yeah, so everyone loves Claude, man.\nI mean, Claude's coding abilities get consistently high marks across the internet.\nPeople want to use it.\nAnd another company that does is Cursor.\nWe'll talk about them in detail in a second, but I found it interesting that Enthropic while talking to tech at their event about this decision, cited Cursor as a long-term customer of theirs.\nSo, I went back through the Cursor, which is the product made by any sphere, but we call them Cursor because it's easier.\nUh, they raised some of their earliest capital from Open AI.\nOkay.\nWhich just goes to show how how intertwined everything is here.\nIt's kind of no conflict, no interest.\nYeah.\nI mean things grow and people place bets.\nIt happens all the time.\nYou know, I'm an LP in other funds.\nThose funds might invest in a competitor to a company I'm working on.\nA company I'm working on might pivot into a business that they're already investing in.\nAnd yeah, you know, bad feelings happen.\nAnd you know, but all's fair and love and war and startups.\nSo, on that point, one last final question about this because I've been I've been trying to figure out what the advice for founders here should be because on one hand, you're not going to get cut off by Anthropic unless you're a big name and something goes ary, but at the same time, if you were picking a a way to go about building your startup and you have closed models and open source models, would this anthropic windsurf beef push you more towards the open source side to avoid it?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nAnd or being multimodel.\nAh, so you know, if you were building, you know, a product, you would\n\n\nI want to just be multimodel for sure.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd then you can swap out models as needed as they improve.\nThat makes a lot of sense to me.\nSo essentially, you just don't want to have platform lock-in, effectively.\nCorrect.\nOkay.\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense to me.\nYeah.\nAnd and I think they probably have the ability to move it over, but you know, who knows if they're ready to do that under what time frame.\nAnd this is why you have an agreement and a long-term agreement.\nSo if Windsurf was being built off of Anthropic's products, you would probably want to have a 2-year contract, a three-year contract to avoid this kind of thing happening.\nSo who knows if they're on a month-to-month contract, a quarterly contract, but that's what a 2-year contract would do.\nIf this was a two-year contract, they couldn't be cut off, right?\nOr else they would have a legal action they could take.\nSo yeah, this is complicated stuff.\nOr there used to be a break clause that got them money or something other than, you know, having their API access snipped and then having to go tell their users, \"Sorry.\"\nAll right.\nUh, moving on.\nOne last update from uh some recent news.\nJason, we've been covering the Ripling spying saga.\nUh, spying.\nSorry.\nThe alleged Ripley spying.\nThank you.\nUh, Ripling is an American.\nYou want Alex to get sued?\nDo what what logo is right there, man?\nThat's Yeah, we I'm This Week in Startups.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSue Jason, not me.\nUm, Rippling is an HR, tech, and payroll giant.\nUh, recently raised a series G at about a $17 billion valuation.\nDeel in the same space was worth at 12 billion.\nJust giving people context about the companies.\nThe background here is that earlier this week, Deel tried to create two bits of news, Jason.\nThey said that uh one rippling former contractor now employee had done something slightly untoward.\nFair enough.\nAnd also that they reached the 1 billion ARR milestone.\nUh Ripley came right over the top of that with new allegations and I want to get your your take on a couple of things.\nThere's some stuff in here that I would say is not surprising.\nUh Ripling writes in its new suit that Deel was regularly bragging about new hires bringing secrets from other companies that I think the CFO said that he maintains quote spies at other companies and that Ripley was behaving poorly.\nNone of that's kind of a shock given the other allegations that they have said.\nBut something that did catch my eye was this, and I'm going to quote from the suit here.\nSo again, I'm not saying this.\nThis is what has said.\nUh around April 23rd, 2025, just 2 days before the financing was scheduled to close, this is their series G.\nA quote tier 1 investor quote in a position to know about um Deel's response to Rippling, contacted a very senior partner at Rippling's series G investor.\nThat person claimed Deel would quote soon be hitting back with material information against Rippling in this litigation and urged the investor to delay until Deel's response came out.\nAll right, founders, let's be honest.\nHow much time is your team wasting on debugging your products?\nIf you're like most startups, it's too much time.\nAnd that's where Sentry comes in.\nIt's a real-time error monitoring and tracing platform, so you know exactly when something breaks, where it happened, and most important, why.\nNo more 1:00 a.m. Slack threads or digging through endless logs to figure out what's going on.\nNope.\nNow you're going to meet Seir, Century's new AI debugging agent.\nLike a new engineer who already knows your entire codebase, Seir finds the root causes of the issues 94% of the time, and it's getting better every day.\nHere's your bottom line.\nYou're going to ship faster.\nYour team isn't going to drown in bug alerts.\nAnd instead of grinding through your logs, your developers are back to building great product.\nHere's your call to action.\nNew users get 3 months free of the team plan.\nThat's going to cover 150,000 errors.\nGo to century.io/twist and use the code twist.\nThat's s ny.io/twist.\nwhich to me is a bit of a surprise because if I was an investor in Deel and this had gone down I I would be trying to back away from the company to a degree just given the ethical lapses that are alleged to have happened.\nI was surprised that an investor would try to scupper Ripley's own round and then perhaps hope that that wouldn't get out.\nSo question for you is is that sort of skull dudgery scoldery normal in venture circles because this seemed more underhanded than I could have anticipated.\nIf it was two friends and we worked together and we we went to business school together and I was helping them out and just giving them a heads up like, \"Hey, Deel's got their own response coming.\nYou might want to just hear that cuz it's coming out tomorrow.\"\nThat wouldn't be dirty.\nThat would be helping your friend out, right?\nAh, so there's a possible um humanitarian that would be maybe how Yeah, that person might explain it.\nNow, if you had met at a trade show and you've been at conferences and you knew each other and you know you were at, I don't know, Andre and I was at Sequoia or Spark or COTU or YC, you know, all these shared backers, whatever.\nAnd I said, \"Hey, you know, uh, you might not want to drop that wire and sign that term sheet until you hear the full story because, you know, I've seen it and it's pretty gnarly, brother.\"\nUh and you were doing it to sync the funding, you would be there are some legal concepts around trying to uh impede the other person's ability to do business.\nUh, but it would be very hard to prove.\nI think I'm not a lawyer, but yeah, generally, yeah, it would feel like it all feels a little dirty and backhanded and back room unless it was like, hey, we were, you know, fraternity brothers, sarity sisters, and I was just trying to let you know like, hey, just heads up here, you know, and you you you you make your own decision as to what level of risk you want to take because obviously the person who is doing the series G knows about this lawsuit.\nThey know all about it.\nThey just don't know the response.\nSo, he's just saying, \"Hey, just, hey, the response is coming.\"\nUm, yeah, but it does feel like, yeah, maybe this has gotten so bitter that we're just going to have a hundred of these little updates until they settle.\nUm, and then I think the big winner here is that both of these companies now are probably going after something very significant.\nSo, there's the big prize.\nTherefore, people are behaving badly allegedly.\nAnd sometimes when there's a big prize, people get petty or they lose their ethics and morals and and do crazy things.\nUh, you know, so I've seen this kind of thing before when you have two competitors who are dogged and aggressively going after each other and yeah, I've gotten emails, you know, uh, or back channels during the lift Uber days during That's what I was thinking.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI mean, there's this, you know, Robin Hood and everybody else, whatever.\nYou know, I've had these call.\nI had one time somebody calling me trying to just character assassinate you.\nOh, this person is a bad person for these reasons.\nAnd you know, it's like literally another VC calling me to sort of badmouth the founder that we were investors in.\nAnd I think we were it was during a funding round because we were going to invest more.\nSo yeah, these kind of shenanigans can happen.\nSo, the way that I'm reading this very very selfishly is that all the complaints by venture capitalists about quote hit pieces is just them projecting contained guilt for them bad channeling on the back channels versus, you know, doing it in public.\nUm, one more little detail from this case though, Jason, because this both can be true.\nBoth.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nIt's true.\nSo, apparently Deel um had a agreement with a startup accelerator, not named, but there's only so many out there.\nAnd I know it wasn't launched because I'm pretty sure you would have told me uh that essentially Deel stole their CRM which Ripley describes as its trade secret customer database containing confidential and valuable non-public information about customers.\nThey just took it.\nThey took the accelerator CRM.\nYeah.\nSo part of the part of the the new allegations from Ripling is that there's other companies that have been harmed in similar ways.\nSo if DL went to YC or Tech Stars, the allegation would be they downloaded their CRM, but it could be the public list of companies on like YC's list of p companies and techars are listed on their website.\nBut that's why it says confident confidential and valuable non-public information is the key key bit from so that means on the internal on bookface which is YC's internal they scraped bookface is going to be the allegation.\nIf it in fact is YC.\nIf it is YC.\nYeah.\nIf it's YC, then it would be that they scrape Bookface, which might have the email addresses.\nYeah.\nAnd you know, whatever.\nYeah.\nAnd what's the board's responsibility here?\nUh, in terms of I mean, if they find out about it, they have to investigate it.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nAnd that's where that's where it stops or what?\nThey have to investigate it and then depending on what the investigation shows, you have to take action.\nSo, you do an investigation, you hire an outside counsel, they investigate.\nDid you steal this?\nWhat happened?\nThey find out who stole it and then they say, \"Okay, that person has to go and we have to inform the company that we, you know, took the data from that we've deleted it and and come to some settlement with them.\"\nSo, you can have all kinds of crazy things that occur.\nYou know, in a harassment or uh case, you would have something similar.\nThey would do an investigation.\nOh, this person harassed another person in the company or fired them for no reason.\nAnd uh yeah, or this person stole something or they were putting personal stuff on their corporate credit card.\nI've seen that one happen where somebody was putting stuff on their personal credit card they shouldn't.\nA little investigation occurs and then you say to the person, \"Okay, yeah, you're being fired or you're being demoted.\"\nYou could take whatever action the outside council says you should do.\nSo that's where lawyers make a lot of money cuz these investigations tend to cost 100k, 250k just to do them.\nWow.\nSo now you got a 250 I've been in the middle of it many times.\nI many times a few times actually.\nI take it back a few times.\nWell, I'm curious to see what the board eventually does in this case.\nIt to me again with the allegations just being allegations still, but if they are proven, um, I would hope that the board would move to replace leadership to rebuild the moral integrity of the company.\nAll right, tell me about what's going on with Cursor.\nFastest growing startup of all time.\nMaybe fastest growing startup of all time.\nWe have talked about this impending funding round several times on Twist.\nI'm glad to kind of bring it to a conclusion.\nFirst of all, one, it's more money than we thought.\nIt's 900 million, not the 500 we have been discussing.\nAnd the valuation is a little bit higher than I anticipated.\nIt's a $9.9 billion I presume post supply 9 billion pre plus the capital so call it 10.\nUh Thriveled and Dre and Excel and DST were in there all that blah blah blah.\nWho cares?\nIt's another AI round.\nWhat matters is this.\nCursor says that it's now not at 300 million ARR as was reported.\nIt's now above 500 million in annual recurring revenue going from essentially 100 to 500 in 6 months.\n100 to 500 in 6 months.\nSo that would be doubling every month.\nBasically, you went from 100 to 200 to 400.\nNo, less than double.\n50% a month.\nWent from 100 to 150, 225 to still 325.\nYeah.\nIt's it's like 50% growth month over month.\nIt's crazy.\nIt's absolutely insane.\nThat would be like 10% growth every week.\nSomething in that range.\nWeek over week 10% growth.\nIt's crazy.\nBut from a nine figure base, I mean if stay for a paid product like 10% would be fast for a free photo sharing app.\nYes.\nTo do it for a paid product is bonkers.\nThis is bonkers.\nSo it's spreading like wildfire.\nIt's kind of like Slack spread like wildfire.\nYeah.\nBut I wanted to go back and get some historical context on how fast is this growth because one of the best IPOs ever and going back to different ways to go public, Google went out via a reverse Dutch auction and that went so well that no one ever tried it again.\nUh, but I went back to their S1 and I pulled their numbers and Google went from 199 million in revenue in 2000 to 86 in 2001 to, and this was the key moment for them, 350 in 2002.\nYeah.\n4x.\nYeah.\nBut that's still so much slower than what we're seeing from Cursor here.\nSo, I think this goes to show one that AIdriven tooling for highly paid professionals is something that companies will just pay for.\nAnd also, I think it shows how much bigger the internet is today.\nJust I was about to say like 2000 there was probably 500 million people online and now there's four billion.\nSo yeah.\nYeah.\nIt's 10 times as many people online probably and you know probably three times as many developers and they probably all have corporate cards now and they weren't allowed to buy this stuff.\nIt's a it's this is combining the virality of consumer with you know the a subscription model which you know it's kind of like Netflix or Disney Plus.\nYou know, when we saw Disney Plus come out, it really grew fast for that first couple of years in terms of the membership, especially at $8 a month.\nSo, yeah, it's awesome.\nAnd, uh, this company could be going public.\nSo, Cursor, you know, if it if it does this again, if it gets to a billion in revenue, like, they should go public.\nI I mean, I think so.\nThere was an interesting story in I think it was Reuters a couple days back that said that Windsurf and uh, Cursor have negative gross margins.\nI don't know if they actually meant negative gross margins or negative operating margins.\nI would be shocked if they actually had\n\n\nNegative gross margins, but there's an interesting kind of split screen here that we can draw.\nSo, we've talked about Anthropic, the Punish Native Model Company, $60 billion reportedly at a $3 billion run rate.\nNow, 20x recurring revenue more or less.\nWhat's interesting is Cursor, 10 billion, 500 million, also 20x.\nYeah.\nAnd they both just seem so cheap to me given their pace of growth.\nIs the market just concerned that they're not going to keep growing this fast or 20 times top line is you know pretty juicy if okay but appropriate if you're growing if you're doubling year-over-year, tripling year-over-year, etc.\nSo you know you're getting a big premium there because when it becomes a public company it will be 20 times earnings as opposed to topline, right?\nSo you know sometimes people conflate the profit with the top line, you know, sales.\nSo sales here is 20 times sales, not 20 times earnings.\nSo at some point the quality of this revenue, is it profitable, is going to be the question.\nNow we don't know how much compute is being used by each of these players.\nWhat if, you know, uh, like YouTube or other businesses, you know, they were in a J curve or Uber where they're selling rides for less than the ride cost and they're losing money every ride.\nYou know, that J curve could be what's driving some of this revenue growth.\nThey could be selling $100 bills for 50 bucks right now, and they need to fill in that gap.\nAnd that gap would get filled in by people becoming addicted, the price of compute going down, and maybe their ability to charge going up.\nAnd that's the J curve, right?\nYou invest and you lose money, lose money, lose money.\nThen you stop having to invest money and you're growing, growing, growing, and then wildly profitable because the costs stay fixed.\nYep.\nAnd you're raising your prices and it's growing viral.\nAnd you don't have to pay people to download the Uber app because they're just getting invited to Uber Teen by a friend.\nOr you don't have to get somebody to know what Cursor is because the other four developers that they know are like saying to the two developers, you don't use Cursor, are you an idiot?\nAnd the and they get pulled in without an advertisement whereas the first couple might have needed to get hit with an advertisement.\nYeah.\nSo these are going to be incredible businesses.\nThe business is strong.\nVenture has a bright future.\nThe wrath of Khan is over and I think DPIs are going to spread through the heavens and um America's going to win again.\nAll right.\nNow, I know we have to go, but before we do, let's just take one quick look at Poly Market.\nNow, I have I have pulled what I think is the juiciest single chart I've ever seen on Poly Market for us.\nThere's a great market that they're running uh discussing what's going to happen with uh interest rates in the US.\nJason, you and I pay a lot of attention to the labor market and the price of money.\nAnd if you take a look at this chart here, this is about the Fed decision in September.\nNow I we're at the furthest edge of this particular market on poly market.\nSo the dollar volume here is much lower than for the June decision or the July decision because there's multiple Fed meetings coming up.\nYeah.\nBut what I really appreciated about this is if you look at the chart, you see a lot of movement in the last couple of days.\nAnd two things happened that really shook the numbers here.\nOne, ADP dropped a very small drop report if you will saying that employment growth was very low and so people said that hey there's a higher chance of a decrease by September in the federal rate as a response to that then today the BLS dropped a different data that was much more positive about the labor market and you can see how it swapped yet again so this to me shows that the poly market betting is incredibly responsive to news events on a very sober basis I think it's pretty good to see you know yeah I mean there's The majority chance is no change and the second uh most uh expected outcome is a 25% decrease 39% no change 57%.\nSo most people believe the Fed's not going to do anything in September.\nAnd like the July and June numbers are even lower.\nIt's like 98% and 80%.\nSo basically with the GDP report there's some projections that GDP is going to be like 4% 3.8% 8% in the second quarter.\nFar from a recession, which is two negative quarters of GDP.\nSo what this means is no rate cuts.\nThere's not going to be free money.\nSo stocks are not going to go crazy because the economy is healthy and GDP strong.\nYes.\nSo in one case you get cheaper money because the economy is weaker.\nIn the other case, you get consumers and enterprises that are strong because the economy is strong and they have more money to spend.\nAs a startup, both of these things can be helpful.\nOn one side, you got great consumers who want to buy cursors products, who want to buy Deel or Rippling and they're adding employees because the economy is strong.\nOn the other side, you get free money, which means you can invest in starting new companies because you're in a zer environment.\nSo, I think what we're looking at is the former.\nWe have a strong economy.\nTherefore, don't expect the rates to come down.\nWe're not going back to that, which means homes and mortgages and car loans and all that stuff is going to be expensive for some time to come.\nYep.\nSo, hopefully you're buying everything in cash, everybody.\nJason, I know you have to go.\nWe're back on Monday with even more twist.\nIt's going to be a blast.\nBye, everybody.\n",
