Should they just go\nfor the revenue? when should they go for\nuh an investment? When should they wait?\nUh and who should they target? All\nright. So, on the show today, we have\nPaige Doherty. She's a founding\npartner at Behind Genius Ventures, which\nwrites quarter million dollar checks and\nas of today, we checked before the show,\nhas written 52 different investments.\nThen we have Megan Reynolds, a partner\nat Altimeter Capital, where she is the\nhead of capital formation. If you don't\nknow Altimeter, they're a technology\ninvestment firm that invests in both\nstartups and public companies, or as she\nputs it, from series A through public.\nAnd then of course, we have Jason\nCalacanis here today, not in his suit,\nwhich gives five demerit points, but he\nis the founder of the launch fund and\nthe launch accelerator. And as Jason\nsaid, my name is Alex. So guys, today I\nknow that everyone wants to talk about\nsecondaries, so I thought we'd just\nstart there to set the groundwork here\nfor everybody. Do recall that industry\nventures data shows that global\nsecondary activity is rising and should\nset an all-time high this year. If\nyou're on the audio version, the firm\nestimates that there'll be about $122\nbillion worth of VC secondary this year,\nup from say about $ 105 billion in 2021.\nPaige, starting with you, how is your\nfirm considering use of secondary for\nliquidity? And do you think it's going\nto replace M&A as the majority source of\nliquidity for early stage funds? Okay,\nAlex, thank you for the great question.\nThere's a couple of pieces in that that\nI want to discuss. Like one one of your\nquestions was like, do you think that\nsecondaries will replace M&A and IPOs as\na primary source of liquidity? I think\nthere was like a there was some data\nshowing recently that 74% of exit value\nhas been from secondaries, whether\nthat's GPLE, LPLED, or tender offers. So\nI feel like the secondary's market will\ncontinue to rise as like a primary\nsource of liquidity. However, when I\nthink about that on the fund level, the\npremiums are rising for secondary. So it\nused to be that secondaries would trade\nat a pretty significant discount. Um,\nand I think that that as premiums rise,\nlooking at like opportunistic secondary\nsales where they're almost like inbound\nopportunities,\num, I think those will be the ones that\nwill have like the best price on the\nsecondaries. Uh but when it comes to\nlike Behind Genius, I think it's really\nlike deferring to our LPs and their\nliquidity needs and really understanding\num you know based on the timeline that\nthey're expecting like how can we come\ntogether to create a solution? Jason, I\nwant Jason I want you to weigh in on the\ndiscount and premium side of things.\nWhat is launch seen in the market and\nhow much more or less attractive have\nsecondary offers been to you in the last\ncouple quarters? Well, during peak zer,\nwe took advantage of a number of our\nunicorns uh that had secondary\nopportunities. And when we did that, uh\nlooking at say the top two in both of\nthose cases, those companies four years\nlater, three or four years later are\ntrading at below or you know far below\non the secondary market the price that\nwe sold at. So that would be a great\ntrade and we look really smart to our\nLPS for having trimmed our positions and\nstill having a lot of our position left.\nIn both those cases, we still have 80%\nin the game, but we've trimmed 20%. One\nin two transaction, one in one. And when\nI look back at my Uber sales, I did uh a\nsale confidentially, don't tell anybody,\ndirectly to the company uh when the\ncompany was at a peak valuation,\nprobably around 30 or 40, low 30s a\nshare. uh my friend Travis who was\nrunning the company at the time uh was\nable to provide me personally with some\nliquidity which was incredibly good for\nmy family uh and for my diversification\nbecause it had become such a polarized\nposition on my balance sheet and um then\nI sold some to Masan Masayoshi and then\nI held the rest and still hold to this\nday and that those have also been good\ntrades. So, you know, even though I sold\nsome to Masa, I think at 37 and a little\nbit to the company at 30, you got to\nremember that was like 8 years ago and 6\nyears, maybe five years, six years ago.\nSo, if you look at those two trades,\nMegan, I think, you know, they you you\nhave to look at time. I put that money\nto work in other investments that also\ndid fantastic in that time. So, while I\nmay have left 2 and a halfx on the or 2x\non the price of Uber today in its 80s, I\nwas able to buy a house that doubled in\nvalue in Hillsboro.\nSo the same and I got to live in that\namazing house. So this is where I think\nBill Gurley said you can't eat uh uh the\npaper gains TVPI. You can't eat TVPI.\nYou can't eat TVPI. Megan knows his\nquote. And so you know the way I look at\nit now in talking to my LPs I've told\nthem we now have an explicit and this\nmight be the difference between Paige\nand I now I've gotten my ass kicked for\nyou know maybe I guess maybe six or\nseven more years than Paige. I'm like,\nany chance we get, evaluate it. So much\nso that I took one of our 11 investment\nteam professionals and I put them\ndirectly in touch with all the secondary\nmarkets and I said, I want you to tell\nme every change in price and I want you\nto guys to keep me honest and tell me\nwhat we should trim, what we shouldn't,\nand why. And so we do this now as an\nongoing thing. And Megan really informed\nme of this. We were on a trip to um Abu\nDhabi and Dubai in the region years ago.\nBy years I mean two maybe.\nDog ears. Dog ears for us. tough couple\nyears. And on that trip, you know, I was\njust asking her a lot of questions about\nthis and portfolio construction and\ncommunication with LPS. So, I added two\nthings to my fund. We are hyper\ncommunicating with our LPs. And we have\na very, very specific strategy. Sell 10%\nwhen we're 50x, sell another 10% when\nwe're at 100x, 200x, and just keep doing\nthat four times. Four four 10% cuts\nuntil the eventual exit is my strategy.\nAll right. All right. So, Megan, I'm\ncurious. Is Jason's approach here\nsomething that you're seeing in funds\nthat you guys back or is he a bit of an\noutlier in formalizing a secondary\nprocess as opposed to just being\nopportunistic with a chance to get a\nlittle early liquidity?\nYeah, look, I mean, the pressure for DPI\nis very real for GPS today. I mean, I\nthink I saw a stat recently that if you\nlook at all funds 2015 to today, 75% of\nthose funds have not returned a dime.\nNot a single dime and that's inclusive\nof funds that are 10 years old and so\nthere is huge pressure from LPS for\nliquidity and that comes in two forms\nwhen you look at the data that you put\nin the chart earlier there were two\nstacks one of those is the LPS that are\nselling funds\nand so there the LPs on their side are\ndriving liquidity and the other is\ndirect secondary so this could be that\ncomes in a different form that's GPS\nthat are selling positions direct\ndirectly or strips of positions or\nslices of their portfolio or it's GP\nlike secondary funds that are investing\nin secondaries on company cap tables\ndirectly so employee liquidity etc. So I\njust want to draw that distinction. I\nthink there's going to be an explosion\nof both. I think the secondary market\nfor venture is maturing in real time.\nCan you explain strips and slices for us\njust for folks out there a little bit\nless familiar with the different forms\nthat secondary transactions can take?\nThat's right. So if and Jason was just\ntalking about this about him selling a\npiece when I say a slice of a position.\nSo Jason's 50x into a deal and he\ndecides he's going to send 10 sell 10%\nof the value of that to a buyer. I would\ncall that a slice. I'm selling a a\nlittle slice of my position. I still\nhave plenty of skin in the game, but I\nwant to return some capital back of my\ngains to my LPS. Another way that you\ncan do it is you can actually sell a\nstrip, what I call a strip sale of your\nwhole portfolio. So, I'm actually going\nto effectively just sell and I think I\nthink maybe NA did this this year. There\nwas a big fund that had announced this\nthat they had done a strip sale. So, it\nbasically just said I'm sold 10% of\nevery single company in my portfolio\njust to it's not making a call on one\nposition or the other, but I'm just\ngoing to sell sell a strip of the whole\nthing.\nHey founders, I want to share with you\nan experience I love. It's when I get an\nad that is relevant and not some\nnonsense. Like the other day, I got an\nad for a fund management platform and it\nwas like a new one I'd never heard of. I\nclicked on the ad because well, I\nmanaged four venture capital firms. We\nscheduled a call with them and it was\namazing. How did this happen? Well, I\nwas on LinkedIn because I like to share\nlinks from the podcast This Week in\nStartups right on LinkedIn. In fact, we\nlive streamed to LinkedIn three days a\nweek and we had a great audience over\nthere and I happened to be presented\nwith this fund management platform and\nit was a direct hit. Like I mean talk\nabout hitting the bullseye. If you're in\nbusiness and you're making a product or\nservice, it's really hard to find\ncustomers in the businessto business\nspace and doing B2B advertising is hard\nbut LinkedIn makes it so easy because\nyou know their tools let you target\npeople by job title, industry, company\nsize and more. So, this fund management\nplatform obviously was looking for\npeople in venture capital who had a fund\nsize and a number of people, maybe 10\npeople, maybe 50 people, and they found\nme. They got me. They split the arrow.\nBoom. Right on target. And there's two\nthings you really need to know about\nLinkedIn going into 2025. First, they\nbroke a billion members. And 130 million\nof those billion are decision makers and\n10 million of the billion are sea level\nexecutives like myself. Where can you\nget to those people? It's really hard.\nAnd the second thing you need to know,\nLinkedIn makes an impact. B2B marketers\nreport two to five times higher return\non ad spend or rorowass return on ad\nspend. You should know that acronym.\nCompared to other social platforms, 79%\nof B2B marketers say LinkedIn is the\nbest platform for paid media. LinkedIn's\ngoing to let you build the right\nrelationships. It's going to drive\nresults and you're going to reach your\ncustomers in a super respectful business\nenvironment. It's not a place where\npeople are dancing around saying\ninappropriate things or debating\npolitics. Nope. LinkedIn equals\nbusiness. Business equals LinkedIn.\nStart converting your B2B audience into\nhighquality leads today. We'll even give\nyou a hundi a $100 credit on your next\ncampaign. Go to linkedin.com/thisweek\nin startups to claim your credit. That's\nlinkedin.com/thisweek\nin startups terms and conditions do\napply. I think that's what industry\nventures and Dave Mccclure's fund are\ndoing as like their primary activity now\nis those strip sales. They'll they do a\nlot of that. There's another thing that\nyou you'll hear in the market that's\nvery popular to talk about called\ncontinuation vehicles. So, this is where\nyou actually take an asset out of a\nfund, roll it into a new fund, you give\nyour LPS the option to participate or\nnot, but it's a way to deliver. So, you\neffectively return the capital back to\nyour fund, but you continue to own it.\nthere's some LPs who won't want to\nparticipate and so you bring in people\nlike Industry Ventures or Dave Mccclure\nor Stepstone Group or Caller Capital\nlike there's tons of secondary buyers\nout there. So there's all of these\ndifferent technologies for returning\ncapital and all of them are important\nand growing in a world where there's\njust there's no M&A and no IPOs. like\nthe volume is still like it's just not\nwhere it has been in the past and it's\nnot commensurate to deliver liquidity\nthat people that our LPs need to\ncontinue to fund the ecosystem. It it's\nfunny when I learned about venture\ncapital we didn't talk about strip sales\nand slices and secondaries as much and\nit does feel a bit like the private\nequityization of venture. second. I'm\nI'm curious, Paige, if you thought you\nwere going into like baby private equity\nwhen you started a venture capital fund\nor you thought you were actually going\nto get to uh some IPOs. Well, I guess I\nactually started in what you would call\nlike baby private equity. I had an\ninternship at TBC Capital, which is a\ngrowth equity firm um in San Diego and\nfocused on buying uh large minority\n\n\nPositions in software companies that were doing between like 1 to three million in ARR.\nSo, like, ironically, that's almost the profile of like a seed a company today, uh, given how much metrics have moved.\nAnd so when I was there, I learned a lot from the partners about like the secondaries market in growth equity and how that was growing.\nUm, so I I feel like it was something that I came into venture with a consideration of.\nAll right, I want to talk about M&amp;A a little bit.\nIt's the other side of the liquidity equation.\nAccording to NVCA data, we did see a relatively strong Q1 compared to recent years in total exit volume.\nStill very much below what we saw in 2021.\nRecently, Crunchbase reported that in May, we saw a strong uptick in global venture-backed M&amp;A.\nPretty encouraging.\nClearly less than March, but certainly a lot better than we saw in 2024.\nSo, I want to go around the horn here.\nWhat are we seeing in the market regarding M&amp;A transaction velocity and pricing?\nAnd are you guys optimistic that things will get better?\nAnd Jason, we'll start with you.\nI always look at not what the administrations say, but what they do.\nMany administrations are effervescent and vocal.\nMaybe they start with incredibly bombastic behavior and words, and then we see the reality.\nSo if you were to look at, say, trade and tariffs, it started with this incredible bang, and you know, depending on how cynical you want to look at it, it's moved to a 2.0 phase, which seems incredibly reasonable.\nWe can debate if you should do extreme things and then do very, you know, moderate things, and if that's chickening out or a strategy in 4D chess, come out with a big ask and then revert back to what you actually want.\nPolitics aside, every M&amp;A transaction during the Biden administration and the wrath of Lena Khan was faced with extreme pushback.\nEvery single one of them.\nI I can't remember one of them where people weren't hand-ringing, and we even saw the unwinding of the great Adobe Figma 20 billion dollar, you know, rain down pure cash on the venture industry that was a pure cash boom, you know, massive amount of distributions that company was half owned by venture.\nI'm sure would have been $10 billion to the L people, and what do we have, a two-year wait, right, till they go public, probably.\nSo that's two more years, and I I bet you the IRR is only going to go down on those investments.\nMegan will back me up here because she probably has the inside dope on it.\nSo, because that got delayed two years, there is a value to money, and it's going to be the same valuation, perhaps less.\nSo, if it's a lower valuation, those folks are going to be like, \"Ah, bummer.\nI could have got that money back, put it to work, and got two years at 10% or, you know, just in money market for 6%.\"\nBut when I see Salesforce make a big purchase, when I see uh the new uh potential king of M&amp;A, Sam Altman, make two purchases in one month, he's he, you know, he's he studies people.\nData Bricks has been inquisitive.\nData Bricks, thank you.\nUm, Uber's been buying little, you know, tuck-ins here and there, uh, you know, in different markets.\nThat's pretty interesting.\nDoor Dash as well.\nDoor Dash bought two.\nMhm.\nAnd these, if you look at them, I think all the ones we described, Megan, are 1 to six billion on average, 1 to 8 billion, and Whiz obviously happened.\nI think that's your big spike there.\nSo even if the MAGA folks are anti-tech, supposedly anti M&amp;A, supposedly, this is a flurry of really exciting deals, really exciting deals.\nAnd then the 10%, 20% of the last value of a company offers we were getting in the crowd are now to 50, 60, 70% of the high water mark.\nSomething's happening here.\nPeople are optimistic based on their behavior.\nPut aside all the news report, all the debates on allin, all the debates on Behind Genius of politics of hand-ringing and administrations game on the field.\nStock markets about to hit a new high.\nTariffs have been, they retreated on tariffs, and M&amp;A is going crazy.\nPaige, Megan, I'm curious if you're seeing similarly strong M&amp;A vibes out there in the market.\nMegan, start with you.\nI would definitely note exactly what Jason was saying that there's Yes, we haven't had this big deal hit the market that creates a wave of cash coming back to LPs, and Figma not happening yet.\nWhiz is going to take a year to close.\nI mean, it's going to take a while, even if you have a big announcement, for some of these things to actually hit LP's pockets.\nBut in the meantime, smaller deals have been happening.\nYou know, they they really don't hit the radar.\nAnd unfortunately, when you have a concentration of growth assets that represent a large percentage of value in venture portfolios, it's hard to feel the effect of the Data Bricks $2 billion acquisition of Tabular.\nBut it's but it is happening, and I am optimistic about the market.\nI don't think venture is dead.\nI don't think M&amp;A is dead.\nAnd I think IPOs are going to come back.\nIt's a matter of time.\nAnd in the meantime, the secondary markets that we started talking about are a creative way to put some cash back in LP pockets to keep the funding ecosystem going.\nOne of the sales I thought was really interesting was um Zuck's 49% purchase of Scale AI.\nI think that the regulatory pressure that's been happening in the M&amp;A world, like I had a friend at Figma, and like that would have been like a life-changing acquisition for her.\nAnd um it was really interesting to see the aftermath and ambiguity of it.\nAnd I think we'll start to see more purchases in that like 49% that doesn't um trigger some of the regulatory pressures.\nUh, I remember reading that headline being like, I think we're going to start seeing like a lot more of these, especially for larger companies so that they can um still operate like autonomously but provide liquidity to the ecosystem.\nIf you're a startup founder, you've got a million things that you're worrying about at this moment.\nYou know what?\nYou shouldn't worry about your bookkeeping.\nYour bookkeeping should be perfect, and you should have a partner who makes sure it is so.\nAnd that partner is Pilot.\nIt's the industry standard.\nPilot is the largest accounting firm out there built for startups.\nThey know how high the stakes are.\nAnd that's why companies like OpenAI, Scale AI, and Air Table trust them with their books and have done so since day one.\nWhen you use Pilot, you're going to get a dedicated team for everything you're doing from bookkeeping to taxes.\nAnd now, you know, listen, if you need that CFO level guidance, they're going to give you that.\nSo, you can stay focused on what matters: building your team, building your product, and delighting your customers.\nYou should not be stressing over spreadsheets with your P&amp;L and all this nonsense.\nYou want accurate financials delivered on time every time, and you want to be compliant with your taxes.\nYou don't want any last minute surprises.\nAnd when it's time to raise your next round and you're scaling up, Pilot CFO services team is going to help you plan and grow with confidence.\nStartups that use Pilot tend to raise a bigger series B and a bigger series C round than the average startup.\nWhy?\nBecause when you're buttoned up from the start, everything gets easy.\nFocus on your product.\nLet Pilot handle your bookkeeping.\nThis weekend, startups listeners get $1,200 off their first year.\nJust go to pilot.com/twist.\nThat's p i l o t.com/twist.\nHere's the thing.\nWhen you come up with a hack, it has a halflife.\nAnd I think when Zuck does the hack, that's the end of the halfife.\nAnd we're done.\nYeah, I think we're done because people don't like Zuck, and people have a lot of scar tissue about that Instagram and WhatsApp application in government.\nWhen Tim Cook does something, Satya does something, Google does something, it's like, \"Oh yeah, I like Google.\nGoogle search is good.\nOh yeah, I have Windows.\nMy kids use Xbox.\"\nAnd you know, you bring up a toxic brand like Meta, um, which people are like, \"Yeah, Instagram is a, you know, scourge on my family, and my daughter, you know, is like obsessed with it.\nOh yeah, you know, people are getting bullied and harassed on this other platform on Facebook.\nI stopped using it.\nIt's like a certain toxicity there.\nAnd I think Lena was starting to investigate this before she left.\nI think he's just basically put out a huge sign like, look at me.\nI don't care what you think.\nYou can't stop me.\nI think he should have just done the regular acquisition and dealt with some interesting.\nYeah.\nSo I don't know.\nThat's just is my personal belief is we have a new regime in town, and I understand doing it with Lena Khan because she had no choice.\nBut he's been donating heavy to this MAGA stuff.\nHe put Dana White on his board to appease Trump.\nYou know, he did the big apologies.\nHe just made up with Palmer Lucky.\nShout out to my guy two weeks ago.\nMy guy Palmer Lucky and him broke bread, and now they're besties again.\nYou were there for the breaking of the bread?\nNo, no, I was there for the the before.\nOh.\nOh, when Palmer and I cashed things out.\nYes.\nUm, so yeah, I I I do think um he should have just gone straight.\nWhat do you think, Megan?\nI'm curious.\nLike, do you think like these hacks are a good idea, a bad idea?\nI don't know.\nI I I'm not sure that I have a view to be honest.\nMaybe 49% hack.\nUh the 49% hack.\nPeople are Look, people are they're smart.\nThey're going to find a way, and they're they're just they're going to you're just going to find a way.\nAnd this is like in the world in the there is no way that Zuck is going to lose in the battle for AI supremacy, and he is going to find a way to do it, and whether it's a 49% hack or stealing teams or other things like I I wouldn't I wouldn't bet against him, and I think he's very strategic and is going to do what he needs to do.\nBut um in the and in the meantime, like these big companies, Gurley was talking about this on Invest Like the Best and was just talking about the cash balances of these large companies where they they've got the capital to put to work.\nIt's going to find a home.\nWe're going to find a way to do it.\nWe're in a more friendly regulatory environment, but in the meantime, we just haven't the ecosystem hasn't really reaped the benefits of it at all.\nLife h life, what's the word?\nFinds a way.\nYes.\nThat's my Jeff Goldblum.\nIt's terrible.\nI got to work on life uh finds a way.\nIt's good.\nI think I think Megan's point though is really good because Meta has had enough money and enough profit to lose tens of billions of dollars on VR and then keep doing that while also investing so much in AI.\nIt really speaks to the the fundamental strength of the Meta model over the last couple years.\nI'm I'm blown away, Megan, by their ability to just have that much cash.\nUm I want to look back.\nThey've gotten fit.\nThey've gotten they've gotten fitter.\nI don't think preserving cash, right?\nGetting more efficient, being more efficient.\nAnd so, well, we'll see.\nLots There's lots that's going to play.\nI mean, this this year is just going to be less employees now than they did three or four years ago when Brad started dunking on and being like too many people.\nLike, I think they literally have less people now than three years ago, and they're growing at 15% a year.\nI mean, that's crazy.\nYeah.\nBig big tech has slimmed down.\nI think we've all seen that in the uh forums from recent graduates complaining about a der of uh of job opportunities.\nI want to put a cap on the secondary conversation though, cuz I'm just curious what founders should know about approaching Jason raising capital from investors that might be leaving their board earlier through an exit or just having to deal with multi-stage funds versus early stage investors.\nThere does seem to be a bit of a dichotomy now between people that will exit early and people that will exit at IPO.\nSo for founders, just advice on how to handle the new secondary.\nVery simple for founders.\nIf there's a market for your shares, control it, embrace it.\nUm, do not try to fight it because it will happen with or without you.\nMark Pinkis learned that people just started trading his shares, and then the, you know, the horse was out of the barn.\nUh, just say we're going to do it twice a year.\nUm, we're going to put a price on it.\nAs CEO, I'm going to do the price discovery.\nI'm going to control who sells.\nYou put in your requests, and then now you've got ball control.\nYou've said to the market, this is going to occur.\nIt's going to occur July 4th and uh, you know, the week after Thanksgiving.\nThose are the two dates.\nYou put in how many shares you want to how many shares you own, how many you want to sell.\nWe'll get back to you in two weeks after that as to if we can fill any of that demand.\nAnd now you don't have people going off and running a muck on the street trying to find buyers, right?\nYou have ball control.\nYou've told them.\nNow you now you've put it in the VCs and the LPs and their hands to say, \"Oh, no, no.\nI want to go around the back door, and I want to disrespect you.\"\nJason, I have a question.\nWhat do you think is the the size threshold for that?\nLike at what point, at what what size of a company do you think it needs to be for them to take that institutional approach to liquidity?\nIs that something that an like a series B or C company needs to be thinking about because they're 10 years into their journey or like how do you if you're advising founders, like that's obvious if you're BiteDance, if you're the Carlson brothers, but like what at what point do you think that happens?\nI I think it's a distraction, obviously.\nYeah.\nSo I would set the parameter that employees who have been with the firm for four years can make requests.\nInvestors who have been in the company for three years can make the request.\nSo I would do it based on how long you've held your investment that you know we're going to provide this for people who've been investors over x amount of time.\nNow you've narrowed the pool.\n\n\nPeople who are at the end aren't flipping, and you get this sort of transient nature to it, and you're rewarding the people who are the early investors.\nSo, oh, Paige and I did a seed round, and Brad wants to double down with Altimeter, great, we can participate.\nOh, Brad buys a position, and it's year two, and Brad's like, \"Oh my god, this thing's 3x, I need liquidity.\"\nThe founder can say, \"You know what, Brad, you just bought your shares, so can you just hold your horses here?\nUh, you know, give us three years of your investment.\"\nSo, I like that strategy rather than the revenue or whatever.\nAnd it really is demand side.\nThere's no demand.\nThere's no demand.\nSo, you know, but I, I, it's this is a new thing.\nI, I, my, my only piece of advice for the founders is have ball control, set your own rules, and then force your employees, force your management team, force the LP and VC community, force retail investors to stay within your rule set.\nAnd then, you know, if they want to step out of it, great.\nNow, they're no longer friendly with that founder.\nAnd as a founder, you should then just call them, and you should say, \"You'll never invest in another one of my companies if you go off the reservation.\"\nYou jump the fence, you're out of the family.\nYou play by the rules and you're respectful, you're in the family.\nWould you like to be outside the family or you want to be in the family?\nAll right, Paige.\nIf a founder calls you and tells you that, what are you saying back?\nUm, well, I, I guess like I would, I'd be like, \"All right, sir.\nYes, ma'am.\nUm, yes, ma'am.\"\nUh, the also, like, the other thing of like staying inside the family is there are like QSBS holding requirements of five years.\nSo, you wouldn't reap any of the capital gains benefits, uh, if you held for under five years.\nSo, I think that would also be a consideration if you're like an individual investor and you're like, \"Hey, like at 3x, I want to get out, but I might have some tax liabilities because I haven't held for that long.\"\nYou can like determine that.\nBut, I feel like most funds would hold through the QPS holding period because it's like 10 million in, in the QPS side.\nSo, I, I feel like there is sort of a lock in due to that naturally built into the system.\nAnd QBS is the qualified small business, uh, exemption, I believe.\nYes.\nYeah.\nAnd I, I think that's like something that a lot of people gloss over as well in these discussions.\nBut yeah, usually you have to hold a company shares for five years.\nSo, you almost have that, and you have to have been invested when it was under 50 million.\nSo, this applies to seed funds in a major way.\nHey, it's a major part of the seed event.\nFirst 10 million, no cap gains.\nYes, let it sink in.\nYum, yum.\nAI is changing every aspect of the way we do business.\nWe all know that.\nBut lots of people, well, they're not getting enough out of it.\nThat's my belief.\nYour AI apps need to connect to

on the optics, like why should Paige and Jason as seed investors, you know, get 10 million tax-free because, you know, my mom who's a nurse has to pay taxes every year, and it's like because we're taking bets that go to zero 90% of the time, and if you don't give us that kind of tax advantage, we might just move further down the line, and there'll be no angel investors, no seed funds, at least that's Paige and I's position.\nWe're going to keep to that, that we would quit if you take it away.\nPaige and I and the rest of the Invest the innovation detrimental dead.\nWe're gone.\nPaige and I are retiring.\nShe had 26.\nMe at 54.\nWe're done.\nAnd we're taking 100 C.\n100 C funds are retiring as well.\nPolicy then.\nWhy don't we try to double the number?\nWhy 10 million?\nWhy not 20?\nWhat would that unlock for the early stage?\nOh, well, remember you have to be 50 million under assets.\nSo there's like some reasonable math here that has to math out.\nOkay, we can't own more than 10% of a company in, you know, in our best investments.\nUsually it's five.\nYou know, Paige is doing 250k checks.\nShe's net, net hitting five to 2%, 2 to 5% ownership on average and getting diluted by 50%.\nSo, we're, we're, we're small ball.\nYou don't worry about us.\nWe're just, we're just sliding a little check.\nDon't worry about.\nWell, no.\nI, I really, I care a lot about the small investors because data on emerging managers is pretty stark.\nI want to show everyone a chart here.\nOh, let's show the chart.\nThere's the segue.\nLook at that.\nHe set a screen and he just boom dropped the ball on two wheels here.\nHow about that for a segway?\nElegant.\nAll right.\nHere is a chart that Bloomberg called trouble for new VCs.\nThey define emerging managers here as firms in their first three funds.\nAnd it shows, if you're on the audio version, a rise in the amount of capital raised by these firms through 2021, and then what I will call a precipitous collapse.\nTo put some numbers on this, uh, emerging funds raised 64 billion in 2021.\nThat fell to 17 billion in 2024, and through May 8th of this year, it was $4.7 billion.\nI think that is a collapse.\nAnd so, Paige, just starting with you because you are the emergingist manager here, uh, what the hell has happened on the LP side and why is everyone struggling to raise a couple of nickels?\nIt's always a joy as an emerging manager to wake up and see that chart.\nUm, but I like, I think.\nWhy is it a joy?\nCuz you survive.\nI'm joking.\nNo, I'm joking.\nUm, no, you, I would actually argue that you should feel joy cuz you did.\nYeah, you have a fund.\nYeah, that was like very exciting to make it through cuz when we raised our first fund, it was 2021, raised 5 million.\nLike I would say the fund raise was on all we talked to like a lot of investors.\nWe have like 120 LPs, but the second fund was like much more institutional.\nThis like sales cycles for um closing institutional investors is longer.\nUm, but I think there's almost the same like time expansion happening that you're seeing in funding of companies, like the time to go to a series A has never been longer, and each like milestone keeps expanding.\nSo, I almost think it's like that happening, but in emerging manager land where we had this like massive influx of capital in one year where it might have in other markets been spread out.\nThe rise of family offices moving into um the venture space can also have a dramatic impact because venture is like a tiny crumb of the overall private equity market.\nUm, if family offices get super excited in one year about the massive returns they're seeing in venture and they're like, let's all pile in, and then, uh, you see like a large market drop in 22, 23, and those were like very challenging fundraising years.\nUm, those, yeah, those like sales cycles take longer, the relationships that you're building, um, have to go deeper.\nSo, I, I think it's been like a very interesting ecosystem to navigate, and I feel very lucky to have closed our second fund in such a challenging environment.\nUm, yeah, and then just like continuing to educate folks who are interested in like professionalizing their either like angel or syndicate investing into um a fund.\nUh, and then last point on this is I think there's like, there's also a dramatic opportunity cost, like with this whole AI gold rush going on, like you have a, um, you know, if you're a super talented generalist who understands growth and distribution, like analyzing companies, why would you not go join an AI company that's like growing at a dramatic clip that could um, yeah, change your life?\nIt's like because you love doing the work.\nSo, I think that's been the one of the other things that I've been seeing.\nMegan, I want to get you in on this because you know the LP side best.\nSo, why have the purses begun to constrict around the necks of these emerging managers who are doing God's work by funding people with an idea?\nYeah.\nCan you pull up the chart again?\nAbsolutely.\nI just want to point.\nLet's do it again.\nLet's, I just want to flash it because I want to like have a kind of like Squid Game page.\nIt's like Squid Game.\nIt's like me, you, and like four other people are still in the game.\nOh yeah, that's right.\nThat's right.\nYou're red light, green light.\nOh god.\nOh god.\nSo, it is that tough though.\nIt's so, so tough.\nUm, I, you know, I compare emerging manager fundraising to like basically going to Hollywood.\nLike it is that hard.\nLike there is so much exceptional talent out there, and there is talent that's been around the industry that's has an amazing track record and has big films under their belts, and they're competing against the same roles that you are.\nSo, like breaking in is that hard?\nAnd the reason I was referencing the chart again is because the last time you saw the same drop off in emerging manager fundraising activity was 09.\nIt's a liquidity issue.\nLike that's not a surprise.\nLiquidity is the problem.\nThat is why managers are not getting backed.\nBut there's a few other dynamics I want to mention.\nOne, the primary funding base of emerging managers is endowments and foundations and family offices.\nBecause if you're a large institutional investor, you're not, it's, you're not going to write small enough checks unless you dedicate capital to emerging managers.\nLike you just can't get enough capital to work to make it move the needle in your program unless you have some strategic reason to be doing it.\nAnd who's been hit the hardest in liquidity shortfall?\nEndowments and foundations.\nAnd so they are the ones that are with, and I'm sure you've talked about on the show or there's been so much press about what's going on in the endowment community and their constraints, but the fact that they have, they have very limited capital to be putting to work in new managers is part of the reason they're facing this constraint.\nPaige, something that Jason and I talked about on the Monday show was this data set from Andre Horowitz.\nUh, this is the enterprise generative AI startup benchmarks that I really think blew a lot of minds.\nNow for people watching this, this shows bottom, median, and top quartile results.\nJason and I kind of thought that if we're just looking at companies that and Jason has backed or has gotten to the point in which they've gotten data during an investment conversation, we're talking about already the cream of the crop.\nBut these numbers that we're seeing here, you know, enterprise gen AI companies going from zero to 5.3 million in the top quartile in a year is is pretty bonkers.\nWell, I mean, like when I, when I started investing in 2021, it might be like, okay, you need to maybe have like a million or a million and a half to raise an A.\nAnd now it's like, okay, you need like five and to be growing at like 20% month over month.\nLike the, like metrics have gotten much more aggressive.\nAnd then like I'm going to YC demo day um later this afternoon, and they, I think most of the companies in the batch have been told to like, you have to hit like 200k in MR in.\nI'm forgetting what it was, but they all have this like very um specific like timeline on it.\nAnd I think if you, they're like a pretty good signal to look at for like how the market is moving with regards to the targets that they're setting.\nBut Paige, just jumping in, 200,000 MR AR for a 200k in MR.\nWell, YC's, I mean, depending on like how you think about YC, I kind of consider as like premium pre-seed, I would say.\nSo it'd be like to get to either a seed or a, cuz I do feel like a lot of the companies are getting um more capital efficient or they're being forced to because it's like, okay, it's no longer like good enough to be at 5 million an ARR or series A.\nYou also have to have like not raised a ton of cash to get to that point because they're looking at like burn rate.\nSo it actually is becoming more like baby private equity with the venture optionality of like 50, 100x on these companies.\nSo as your 50 out of your 50, how many went to a combinator would you say?\nUm, I think six.\nGot it.\nIs that right?\nDo you think you can actually do the portfolio math in your fund paying 30 million for a pre-seed company with, I mean, we don't pay, we don't pay 30, like our, our average entry point on our fund today is 16 million, and in fund one it was, uh, 15 million post.\nSo we, we own like 1% in fund one and like roughly 2% in fund two, and I would say I've been like pretty dogmatic, and then we've made exceptions for like exceptional founders, like in one case, we like doubled, um, doubled our like average seed check size in a, in a company that was more expensive that was led by like top VCs because I want to get our ownership.\nThat's the big lesson, Megan, is like if you, you need to have a real portfolio strategy here, right?\nYou have to have, uh, some, uh, bankroll management and entry price does matter.\nAnd if you're going to own, you know, 50 basis points versus 2%, you know, and you're going to get diluted 50% along the journey, that's 25% or one 25 bips or 1%.\nYou know, the math just doesn't matter.\nEvery investment has to be a fund returner.\nUh, and I have a couple of winners in fund three where we made small bets to kind of get to know the firm, you know, put in a 50k or 100k check, and then it got away from us.\nNo way to invest.\nAnd now we're sitting there with a, you know, 50x on 50k and it's\n\n\nGreat, except now we have to explain to LPs why we suck at our job and we didn't put a bigger check and we had conviction or why we didn't put a second check in. It's like, well, they went from, you know, a $30 million valuation to $500 million, and it's like, yeah.\nSo, I just, there's so much nuance to it.\nIt is.\nAnd it's like people ask so many questions to your point too, like they, you have to explain every portfolio construction decision in the way that LP's diligence funds today.\nIt used to be they were like, \"We like you. Great story. Okay, here's a check. Performance looks great. Performance looks good.\"\nAnd now it's like, um, our analysts were looking at, um, these seven companies and we, uh, did a, you know, a search on them and it looks like they were complete utter disasters.\nTell us, uh, why did you back this?\nAnd I'm like, yeah, they totally absconded with the money.\nThey didn't return our emails for a year and, uh, they kept their laptops.\nAnd I'm like, \"Welcome to the game, guys. Oh yeah, that founder was committing securities fraud.\"\nYeah.\nIt's like this is the wild west out here on the margins.\nLike crazy stuff happens, you know, like you back somebody and they, they disappoint you.\nSo it's, it's hard, but I, I just don't think the math at Y Combinator mats for seed funds, which is why my best advice, and this is don't aggregate this, folks.\nNothing against YC.\nWe, we don't really compete with them because we accept less than 1%, they accept less than 1%.\nYou know, we, there's just plenty of people if you want to make 125k bet on them in an accelerator.\nThe issue is if the valuations are that overpriced, which you have to ask yourself in one year when they come back to market to raise their next round, what will the valuation of those companies be?\nIf they were valued, you know, if they're at 100K in ARR, I think is what the data was showing in that sample.\nWas it back up?\nI think it was 200 or 200.\nLet's say it's 200.\nWe'll give them a huge benefit at 30 million.\nOkay.\nSo, or let's say it's 300.\nSo, they're trading no two.\nLet's do 150.\nSo, they're trading at 200 times revenue.\nBizarre to even put that valuation on it.\nI know, but that's not how you're making the bet, but it's part of it.\nOkay.\nSo, they're trading at 200x.\nThey go back to market.\nOkay.\nWhat do you think they're going to go back to market at after they've doubled their revenue?\nOkay.\nNow, they're at 300.\nThey're going to go back to market at 100 times revenue again, 30 million.\nThey're going to do an extension 99 times out of 100.\nThey're not going to get an up round.\nSo, just stick around the basket, maintain the relationship, say, \"Hey, we couldn't get there, but we want to be helpful to you.\nWe'd like to get to know you.\"\nAnd you check in with them.\nHey, can we get coffee again?\nHow is it going?\nAnd that's what we do.\nWe just like if we meet somebody, great.\nHey, let's stay in touch.\nI, I would say the other piece of this puzzle is that nobody ever talks about the bottom third of Y Combinator companies that don't clear market.\nSo all these statistics are so massaged, I trust none of them.\nI don't trust any of this data that we pull up here because the game I see on the field is selective, um, data sets.\nWhat are the selective data sets?\nI saw like a Y Combinator slide you showed me the other day and it was all based on TVPI.\nPutting this one aside.\nRemember the TVPI one?\nNicole's tweet.\nYeah, this is from Jason talking about data.\nI thought I'd put it up.\nThis is from Nicole Whiskoff Ventures.\nAnd this shows YC's class of spring 2025 against a number of similar stage companies outside of the YC.\nThese are the ones she met with, just to be clear, not all.\nM, so you would think she would meet with the best ones cuz she's a good venture capitalist and she has some thoroughness in who she meets with and they would probably pick her and but you know this basically shows 5x leverage to invest in seed seed companies preede companies that don't go to YC that actually tracks my lived experience.\nI don't know why I say such an interesting one because I, I do feel like a large amount of the valuation actually based in like the network of founders that they bring and like the talent that they're able to recruit as a function of like having the YC brand.\nSo I almost think it's like if you look at it in like a purely metricsbased thing, like yeah, it might look different, but I think that they have built such an incredible brand in the ecosystem, like YC is like you could go like talk to someone in the Midwest and they'd be like or like a family office in the Midwest and they'd be like, yeah, like I know YC, like I, you know, um, and so I think that there, there is like a global brand element that they've done like an incredible job building and then they also have like very strict guidelines around like each cohort.\nSo, and they like move with a market, like they establish like an additional cohort.\nUm, so I, I don't like it's like if you look at on just a metrics basis.\nYeah.\nUm, twice the price, it'll be different, one-third the metrics or the traction.\nSo, you know, but they're okay.\nBut the argument is correct.\nThey also started, they started later.\nSo some of the seed companies that you might be looking at might have started like three, four years ago and might have raised capital.\nLike a lot of these Y Combinator companies are coming in only having raised YC and maybe like 100K in angel checks.\nAnd so like you're paying up for like their velocity as well.\nIt's like they went through the YC program and like got to 200k in ARR in like a much faster time period than another company.\nSo that's like also to your time value of money question.\nYeah, I would, I think it's a good counterargument.\nAnd the other counter argument is yes, they have a selection process that only accepts 1% like Harvard.\nSo if you're only selecting great founders, you know, you do get less, I think you know, mistakes in the portfolio as it might be like people who just aren't cut out to be founders.\nSo there is that.\nSo you are paying for value and then the question is, I think if you're a hardworking seed manager, your job is to find all the people who are the second, third, fourth percentile that didn't get in cuz they're no different than the first.\nThat's your job as a seed fund is to find value.\nWarren Buffett's whole premise and his whole career is based on buying companies, you know, when they're not popular and you can get a good entry price and then these businesses and these management teams just keep growing with them and you just want to own that business forever.\nYou know, that's kind of the philosophy I've come to in my life with my own family office.\nI'm never selling a share of Robin Hood.\nI'm never selling a share of Uber.\nThe end.\nLike why would we sell any shares in these companies if their management is extraordinary and the products are extraordinary, they'll be here in another 10 or 20 years, but, um, I think as a scene manager, Megan, what I've come to is it's my job to find companies before they go to Y Combinator and the ones who are in that second, third, and fourth, and then be able to buy three companies for the price of one YC company and I'm willing to have seven people screening companies in my company who are researchers and analysts in in order to find that those ones so that I can make three bets for one.\nWhat do you think of my strategy?\nRate my strategy as an LP might candidly, brutally.\nAm I wrong?\nAm I right?\nI give it an eight.\nOkay.\nEight.\nI love it.\nRoom for improvement, but it's solid.\nYeah.\nNo, I think that's a solid strategy.\nI'm devastated right now.\nI always me right now.\nShe just literally, she knows how to motivate without having without having, you know, the chance to really distill it.\nI think, no, I'm just kidding.\nI mean, that's good.\nI like it.\nI think, look, I think that like the, the 1% right there is like that's the selection rate.\nLike you said, there's a million, there's, yeah, there's other great founders out there and finding those that may not get in but need to find the right home.\nAnd I just figured out how to frame it and make it a nine.\nMegan, let me try one more time pitching you.\nOkay, do it.\nOkay, let's see.\nAll right.\nOur job is to out hustle the other seed funds and we want to make three bets for every one for the lazy funds that just go to demo day and just pick whatever, you know, the, the great team at Y Combinator is pre-sorted.\nAnd here's the truth, Megan.\nIt's an uncomfortable truth for Y Combinator, but the best founders do not take the Y Combinator deal.\nThe best founders say, \"I can do better.\"\nAnd so when you see the 1% that get accepted to Y Combinator, in our lived experience, that's the 6 percentile, the top 5% did not go to Y Combinator.\nThe majority of unicorns that you see that have gone public did not go to Y Combinator and those are the ones we're focused on.\nAnd then we focus on 7, 8, 9, 10 that percentile.\nSo if you look at the top 10% of startups, top 5% don't go to Y Combinator.\nThe bottom 5% after the sixth percentile that Y Combinator gets, they're of equal value, but you get, they're of equal quality, but you get to invest in three for everyone.\nSo that's really our portfolio strategy is Y Combinator is awesome, but you can't overpay for startups or else you break your portfolio construction.\nI'm sure Gary Tam won't have any thoughts about that whatsoever.\nNo, wait.\nNo, you maybe was supposed to score it.\nYou didn't let me score it, Alex.\nYou see from my score?\nOkay, I give it a nine.\nOh, and I, let me tell you why you got a point deduction.\nOne, I like data.\nYou had more data there.\nOh, good.\nI like data.\nBut you got a point deduction for calling them bets.\nOh, damn it.\nYou know, I don't like our investments.\nAnd you know, we don't call them bets.\nOur investments because we like to help them grow.\nWe're not looking for just, you know, to make a quick hit here.\nWe really want to learn from these investments.\nEach investment is a chance for our team to get better at and add value.\nYeah.\nOh, good.\nOh yeah, good punch.\nWe're learning Paige.\nLook at this.\nWe're getting free mentorship from Megan.\nThat's great.\nIt's always, yeah.\nYeah.\nJokes aside, it's always about the the founding team.\nIt's like the the teams and bringing them in as part of your community and hopefully, I mean, yeah, following like a similar playbook to YC and like building an incredible like community and brand around the firm.\nI feel like that, yeah.\nAnd then, yeah.\nAnd then all your companies will be able to raise a a 30 post right after the accelerator.\nI'm actually curious if we're talking about seed prices being too high for seedstage fund economics when that's not really the game on the field.\nThere was an interesting conversation about this and Bill Gurley weighed in, uh, discussing how seed valuations are going up.\nI'll just read this tweet.\nA mega VC with 5 to 10 billion annual funds is really searching for only one thing.\nA company they can pile over a billion dollars into with a potential to 5x 10x on that 1 billion.\nWith this seed fund is inconsequential money used to increase the odds of main objective.\nYou are collateral damage.\nAnd so I wonder cuz going back to what Megan said about, you know, you can put money into any fund you want.\nMega funds are getting larger as smaller funds get crunched.\nI wonder if seed pricing is more reflective today, Megan, of just what the Andreas want versus what's good for the launches of the world.\nI think the dynamics of fund size cannot be ignored and I think that it does have an impact all the way like from the top to the bottom of the ecosystem.\nI do.\nAnd look, I, I, I think that was a, that's a wise but generalized statement.\nAnd I'm sure there's and I haven't fully thought through it to say like why it's seed fund money still makes sense and why it's not just collateral damage.\nBut the idea that you have these very, very large pools of capital that want to deploy a billion dollars or at least $500 million or a billion dollars and don't have the same return thresholds that they that funds used to have before is really having some like a major impact on the industry.\nYeah, Jason, we've talked about this ad nauseium on the show just about how these mega funds just have a different expectation for returns and you guys have to work a little harder, uh, for your IR.\nI just love Bill Gurley after dark.\nYou know, Bill Gurley after benchmark is just great.\nHe just after dark.\nYeah, Bill Gurley after dark.\nHe's, he's got a, he's had a couple of ranchwaters.\nHe's, he's, he's lost a couple of big pots in the poker game and he's ready to speak truth to power.\nBut it's the truth.\nIf you have one of these mega funds, you know, you are going to make1 billion dollar bet.\nEverything you do that's investment, I'm sorry, investment.\nThank you.\nYou can, you know, you're looking for a billion dollar investment that can five to 10x to return the fund.\nYou need a fund returner.\nA C check where you own 10%, you know, the chances of it becoming, I, if it, it is just a way for them to get the option to be on your board or be in a board observer and have information rights so that they can preempt that billion dollar check.\nSo when you have Paige as an investor or me as an investor, we're with you all the way.\nWhen when you get dilution, it really matters to us cuz we're not putting a billion dollars in at a three billion or four billion or 5 billion in, you know, valuation.\nWe made that 125k bet, that 250k bet, we're probably not making another one.\nSo we're with you making sure, hey, you sure you want to dilute that much?\nYou sure you want to add that person to your board?\nYou sure you want to burn through your capital and chase like 4x growth this year instead of maybe being more thoughtful and going for two and a halfx and really getting your product market fit and your product team dialed in?\nSo, our investment in\n\n\nYour company is more aligned with you.\nTheir investment is aligned with an 18-month period between when they drop that billion dollar check in, that $500 million check in, and you going public or getting bought.\nIt's a much different game.\nIt's mezzanine financing.\nJason, the only edit I'd say to that is that I think the very large funds, the 5 to 10 billion dollar funds that are at the growth stage are not looking for fund returners.\nLike I don't actually think they're underwriting deals for 5 to 10x because I think that they are expect it's a different portfolio behavior than venture where you have a very high percentage capital loss.\nI actually think they're underwriting for zero capital loss.\nBut you have a two to 3x, they're underwriting for two to 3x outcome.\nSo it's just a little bit of a different dynamic.\nYeah, that makes sense.\nYeah.\nSo maybe three or four of those 4xers make the fund.\nYeah.\nLike you, you kind It's a more consistent driven return buildup.\nThen you have one, the rest lose money and one returns the fund.\nAnd maybe they hold into the public markets for an extra year or two after it goes public.\nYeah.\nAll right.\nI want to talk a little bit about revenue quality, moving a bit away from just kind of the intra venture dynamics because we've seen companies like Glean, Synthesia, Together AI, Cursor, Lovable, and others scaling to 50, 100, 200 million ARR.\nAnd whenever I see these headlines, I also see people from the venture world casting mild doubt on the quality of the revenue.\nPeople are worried that things are being conflated into ARR numbers or that ARR is not going to be actually recurring, that it's going to dissipate.\nUh, I'm curious from your portfolios, are you seeing revenue quality issues amongst AI predicated startups or are those only in other funds?\nAnd Paige, I want to start with you on this one.\nOh wow, that's uh, that's exciting.\nI mean, um, so in in terms of revenue quality, I think that one of the things I'm seeing is like as the our uh, founders got to raise their next round is that this is like a topic of uh, conversation when they're raising their seed, if we back them in pre-seed or their A, and so I'm having the conversation with them like far before they're raising is like this is what investors downstream are expecting and it's like part of the reason I moved to San Francisco last year is like more deeply understand the downstream capital dynamic.\nUm, is like revenue quality really matters.\nUh, I think like there can be mistakes or over representations in reporting that are quite common if you don't have the background of like startup accounting, which like if you're an engineer or like you did something else before, like you might not know it.\nSo I think um, some of it is like a factor of educating early stage founders on like here, like reporting ARR should be like an annual recurring contract.\nUm, if you're a marketplace, it should be reported as like this is your GMV and then you'll have like your um, like your uh, like net profit based on that and not reporting like the GMV of the marketplace is run rate.\nI think that's like a very common thing that I've seen in companies we've evaluated.\nSo I I think that that like more education on startup accounting is needed earlier stage as the metrics change to raise a seed or series A.\nI mean by series A you'll know, but like I think seed is getting more series A on the metrics that they're looking for.\nSo seed is the new series A, pre-seed is the new seed.\nAngel is the new pre-seed, and I don't know what we're going to do next, but there'll be like nano investments at some point.\nMore summers than we call it.\nUm, we call it year zero startups.\nIt's my big focus now uh, as we invest in earlier stage startups and uh, we found that half the applications for funding as Paige mentioned uh, with her strategy of building community come to us before they're incorporated with an idea, perhaps a prototype and a team member, but looking for a third.\nWe had all this energy and we told them, oh, listen to the podcast and let us know after you incorporate.\nUm, but then all of a sudden those founders could get away from us, right?\nThey could find another investor who believes in them and wants to write that check and then, you know, now we're chasing.\nAnd so we said, well, what how could we be of maximum value to them?\nAnd so we took a two-day event we were doing to help support Founders called Founder University and we made it into a 12-week program.\nAnd I put all 11 investment team members on this.\nWe are in our 10th cohort.\nWe have a curriculum.\nWe've invested millions of dollars in this and three or 4 thousand people apply.\nWe pick the top 300 teams.\nWe invest in the top 10% of those and we get to watch them work for 12 weeks.\nAnd boy has that changed how we invest and we will give people their first 25k check to form their company.\nWe found that was another innovation we found.\nPeople couldn't get their first check.\nFirst check's the hardest.\nSo we're like, okay, you just check a box every week.\nWould you like the 25k check?\nWould you like the 125k check?\nAnd it just changed everything for us.\nAnd on revenue quality, the fact that we're even having that discussion now is just so encouraging because a lot of investing but 10 years ago did not have revenue quality as a term, as a discussion point.\nIt was just what's the revenue, how is it growing, that's it.\nUm, there was no are you hacking the revenue?\nAnd again, I don't want to make this a pile on for YC, but founders are clever.\nAnd what YC, you know, did better than anybody was figure out how to create this really aggressive marketplace where everybody felt like they were going to get left behind in maximum FOMO.\nHow do you create maximum FOMO?\nTwo ways was how YC got to it.\nThey told everybody you cannot raise money or meet with investors until the last week.\nThat was like their best and kind of strong advice.\nIt wasn't they didn't ban people from doing it, but most people complied with that instruction.\nWhy?\nYou want to get everybody in the room.\nYou want to create a marketplace.\nAnd you know, all of the language around this is consensus in the industry.\nGet everybody into a 3-week process.\nGet everybody stoked, make it competitive, and then close fast.\nThat's actually really good advice.\nBut then people were like, \"Well, how do I differentiate?\nI can't just scream for one minute during demo day.\"\nI think it got down to like a one minute presentation.\nSo, it was kind of like meaningless.\nIt's meaningless.\nLet's call it what it is.\nIt's meaningless.\nLike just one minute of performance art where you go up there and scream like you're going to change the world and your cam is a trillion dollars.\nIt's meaningless.\nSo what they did was they created the handshake protocol which is another high pressure sales tactic and combined it with a chart.\nAnd when we slowed down the process we would just say to every founder which is why we kind of opted out of it the whole process.\nWe just say well we take like you know 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks to make a decision.\nIf you're on a 3, 4, 5, 6 day, that's not for us, but we'll talk to you the next round and some founders were like okay we'll talk to you next round, majority of them were like oh no no we'll you can take as much time as you need Jay Cal, we want you on the cap table.\nWhen we looked at their charts, we found a disturbing trend when we asked where how did you source these 10 customers?\nFive of them were other YC companies, two of them were friends of the founder.\nSo a ve the that high pressure led to unnatural acts.\nAnd the unnatural act was to make a 12-week chart that didn't have quality revenue.\nWhere did you source the first 10 customers?\nWe ask them, \"Who are your first 10 customers?\"\nThey say, \"Oh, we can't share that with you.\"\nOkay.\nThey're like, \"Okay, so you want to invest?\"\nNo, we can't invest without knowing who those 10 are.\nThen we say, \"Okay, these are the 10 first customers.\nHow many, what's their usage like?\nHow many of them used it in the last 10 days, the last 5 days, today?\nWe want to see the actual usage of those.\nOkay.\nAnd now give us where you sourced them from.\"\nAnd boy did that change.\nAll of a sudden, people started panicking when we asked for that simple information.\nThat seems like very basic diligence.\nIt's very basic diligence that a dentist has no idea about.\nSo if you invite a bunch of dentists, they're like, \"Oh my god, this is Airbnb.\nThey told us you invested in Airbnb.\nThis is Airbnb.\"\nThe problem is, you know, when you, and this isn't all companies, we just we found too many of these for it not to be an explicit trend.\nAnd we asked people, \"How did you come up with this strategy?\"\nThis is the Y combinator strategy.\nSell to other Y combinator companies.\nNow in some cases, startups are the best customer because startups will take a chance on that.\nThat is actually really good advice.\nBut then the gamesmanship that happened was you buy my product, I buy yours.\nCan I get five people to buy mine and and people kind of created these little round robins that I don't want to say it's unethical, but it's unethical.\nPaid thoughts.\nI'm gonna throw doesn't want to like, you know, throw bombs.\nI don't care.\nMy I'm already rich.\nI'm already on my fourth fund.\nIf I can't raise another fund, I can just use my own money.\nI don't care.\nI'm going to be Bill Gurly after dark.\nI know, but I want to give Paige a chance here to stand up and get your career and relationships.\nGo.\nOh, thank you so much for that kind introduction.\nNo worries.\nUm, so happy to be here today.\nUm, I mean, I don't know.\nI I feel like uh, my belief is like they have built a strong brand and community.\nI think it has gotten to the point where there are people who see it as like a shiny badge that they want to like check off and might not be going into it for the right reasons, but have like the chops and the mission and the product to like get in and and I think that's a reality of like whenever a brand or community gets big, you're going to have those actors in the system, but I think there's still like incredible talent.\nI would say the the way that I meet most the YC companies that we invest in is like the first one we invested in is Beacons.\nIt's one of the first investments I made like a LinkedIn bio tool, um, grew super fast or like one of the leading greater tools uh startups and then they introduced us to like a few more YC companies.\nSo I feel like for me it was more like finding a founder who I really loved working with and then they would refer me to other YC founders and then I didn't really have to deal with any of the competitive dynamics.\nSo it was just like is an awesome investor.\nWe love having her on the cap table.\nLike you should take your money.\nSo then it was it was no longer.\nSo I've always found like if there are more competitive dynamics, it always helps to have someone in their network refer me.\nIt's always like the strength of the introduction and like vice versa.\nIf if a founder like one of our portfolio founders uh yesterday was like I have this founder.\nI will like I'm like dragging her by the arms like all of my investors offices.\nLike she is the one like you need to bet on this founder, like that will make me like very incentivized to um yeah to like take a deeper look.\nSo I I think it's like the same in like competitive situations.\nYou have to have like a really strong founder reference um and then do your due diligence.\nAll right guys, we could literally talk all day because there's so much going on, but we do have to make sure Paige makes it to demo day on time.\nSo, what we're gonna do to wrap up today, your badge doesn't work.\nPaige, you wait.\nYour badge didn't open the door.\nJust stand like 10 feet away from me when I start throwing those bombs.\nSo, one question for each of you.\nWe're going to go in order of my screen, which means Jason, we're going to start for you just quickly.\nWhat is a contrarian place or market where you are currently looking for startups and founders today?\nOh my god, what a spicy question.\nContrarian place.\nUm, I think AI enabled services like Athena are you know one of these areas where investors say oh that's a services business, it does, you know, it's not venture scale, just like they told me oh Uber's in the real world, Airbnb's in the real world, Tesla's in the real world, SpaceX in the world, those are not venture scale businesses.\nWhen I hear it's not a venture scale business and the founder says I I I think there's a way for it to be a venture scale business, here's how I think it gets really big, then I pay attention.\nAnd uh, you know, sometimes it turns out to be CPG and it's a dead end.\nIt's a road to nowhere.\nOther times, you know, they they do figure it out.\nHardware as a service like density.io.\nWe're not investors in Whoop, but I would put Whoop in that category where the hardware just enables a SAS subscription.\nThat's very high.\nEightle I think is like kind of like um a healthcare product more and we're investors inleep.\nI think it's a healthcare product.\nSo you know hardware as a service would be one that I I think we we figured out early and then this new one which is okay you're abstracting some human services, maybe picking the developers as micro one does with AI and providing AI human services, these could be very interesting um and most people would say that's not venture scale and when I hear that's not venture scale but I see it growing quickly, that Cognitive dissonance makes me go say more.\nAll right.\nThank you, Jason.\nUh, Paige, over to you.\nWhat is a breakout portfolio company that you have that you think deserves more attention?\nOh, um, one I'm really excited about is a company called Intramotive.\nUm, so one of our big thesis is backing incredible technical storytellers.\nUm, and the founder, Tim Luchini, was a engineer at Boeing.\nUm, based in St. Louis.\nThey have like an incredible team of 50 engineers building electrified autonomous trains.\nUm, and it's just like it's so cool.\nLike I watch their videos and their investor updates and I'm just like I can't believe this is my job.\nUm, that's a company that I am What's the URL?\nExcited about intramotive.com\nI think.\nLet\n\n\nMe.\nIntramote.com.\nI just asked for an intro.\nYeah, just like, it's so incredible.\nSo I'm excited hopefully to get to go out and visit them.\nYeah, I mean, like, how sick is that?\nSo, uh, we've invested heavily in applied AI, um, consumer wellness, and longevity.\nAnd then the third space I'm spending more time in is deep tech.\nI spent like three years at Northrup Grumman in college and studied mechanical engineering and computer science.\nSo that's an area of like deep passion of mine.\nUm, and then yeah, my dad was like a, it worked at a contract manufacturing company that built MVPs of like Formlabs and EcoATM and Minute Key, all these like cloud-enabled kiosks.\nSo, I'm really interested in the intersection of um, hardware and software as it relates to like what happens when we get to like human AI symbiosis.\nUm, and then on the other side of that, like, how does that affect like, uh, us as humans living like healthier and longer lives?\nSo, it's kind of like the dual enterprise consumer lens I take.\nAll right.\nThank you very much.\nAnd then to close this off, Megan, last word goes to you.\nI was thinking, what could I ask her that would drive her slightly nuts?\nAnd I figured this is the most annoying question I could possibly come up with.\nSo, does the stock market close this year above or below current levels?\nPrognosticate above.\nAbove, obviously, not annoying.\nOr not annoying.\nEasy, easy.\nEasy.\nWe're, no, we're at Altimeter.\nSuper constructive on the outlook for the back half of the year.\nI think we think we've, we're through the worst of the volatility.\nOf course, there will still be some volatility.\nUm, the what one LP called the tariff tantrum took us all on a big ride.\nUm, but we are very positive, particularly in tech as we look forward.\nAll right.\nWell, thank you Megan, thank you Paige, thank you Jason.\nThis has been Twist.\nWe'll check on Friday for Alex.\nGood job.\nThank you.\nWow, Alex, very turns out I've been doing this since I had hair.\nBut thank you all very much for coming.\nI appreciate it.\nTwist is back on Friday with the live news at noon Texas time, 1 p.m. Eastern.\nWe'll see you then.\nBye.\nBye.\nBye.\nThanks, guys.\n",
