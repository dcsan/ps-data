  "cleanText": "Tell me a little bit about secrets to recruiting you've learned the hard way. You know, people who look great on paper or hey, they were at, you know, whatever company, Microsoft, Salesforce, whatever. They were selling all this stuff, but it had more to do with that company and their product-market fit than maybe the grid, right, of that individual salesperson. And then also, I think it's a really interesting topic of integrating people into the team and making them feel that they're part of the team even though, you know, they came from the outside. Maybe they weren't part of the formation of the company, but you got to make them feel that they're really part of something. It reminds me of Kevin Durant coming to the Warriors. He never quite felt like he was part of the core, right?\n\nSo, I hate giving away my secrets on these podcasts, and I I've known you for a long time, Jason.\n\nFor example, when I'm recruiting against a Google, okay, I say to the candidate,\n\nThis Week in Startups is brought to you by LinkedIn Ads.

Welcome back to This Week in Startups. Very lucky today to have two of the legends in venture capital. Doug Leone, who got me my start in many ways in the venture business from Sequoia, which he ran for a couple of decades. Now my guy Rulof and my friend Alex are running the show, and you know some of his amazing investments. New bank service now Wiz, just bought by Google. How you doing, Doug?\n\nWonderful. I am no longer a very active partner, meaning I only do an occasional investment, but I am on eight boards for Sequoia, and I'm fortunate enough to have what I call a good backlog of companies, four of which are in cyber security.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat's it like going into retirement? You're not the type who retires. You seem just as busy, and I, you told me you were retiring a couple years ago, you're transitioning, and then every time I go to the office, you're there, and it's 8:00 in the morning, 9 in the morning.\n\nYeah, it's not retirement. The 809 boards keep me quite busy. I co-founded a biotech company, something I don't talk about publicly, but we just raised a series C for $200 million. I happen to be one of the three founders, so that keeps me quite busy. So, I've got a fairly full plate. And if something magnificent comes across the desk and somebody wants me on a board and we can make an investment, I'm happy to do it. What I don't want to do is listen to 50 new companies a week. So I'm not really retired. I'm picking and choosing my spots a little more.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd you brought one of your friends here today, Gili Raanan, who was at Sequoia for a bit and now runs Cyberstarts. That's a venture capital firm that's focused exclusively on cyber security. Is that regularly?\n\nAbsolutely right.\n\nNow, famously, you guys have been working together for a bit, and you did, I think, the largest acquisition in Google's history, Wiz, which we just had happen earlier this year. Maybe you could tell me a little bit of background of how this company started, Gili, and then how Sequoia got involved.\n\nLove to. Pending acquisition, by the way, but that's important. Actually, you know, we, Wiz, is a company that both Sequoia and Cyberstarts, Doug and myself, were the seed investors, and it's the second time we back the same team. We were lucky to invest in that in the in their first company, Adelom, in 2012. I was still with Saka Capital in Tel Aviv. They were a typical young team coming out of the Israeli Intelligence Forces, what many people know as 8200, and we backed them with a small seed. That company had a nice, modest sale to Microsoft 3 years later, and then happened the real transformation. You know, these guys got a lot of responsibility and built a billion-dollar worth of cloud security business within Microsoft and then went out to start their own cloud security business, and we were there waiting for them to go for this amazing journey. Doug, this is a reoccurring theme. Second-time, third-time founders, if they still have the energy,\n\nyes,\n\nyou just snap back them, right? Like, and then how do you know if this is like maybe their third or fourth company where it's a vanity play or maybe they're not really into it or if they still have that energy to lead a company, which we both know is just that's a large amount of energy you need to have.\n\nSo, there are two funny stories I want to tell you prior to answering your question. The first funny story is when I met Assaf, an Adelom, I went to Israel. I met Assaf, and somehow he got his wire crossed. He thought I was DM Valentine, and it was he was very surprised that I was as young-looking as I was 10, 13 years ago for a 70-year-old. And so that's the first, that's the first part of the funny story. The second part of the funny story, when we invested in Wiz, they did not know what they wanted to build. In fact, I'm now told they created a bologna presentation with Hoya the night before so they can pitch something. And truth be known, we had no idea what they were talking about. We have a partner who's far more technical than I called Boamill. And I asked them, \"Hey, Bogamill, I don't know what these guys said. You got to write the memo because I I can't write a memo based on what they told us. It makes no sense.\" Of course, it made no sense. It was a made-up pitch, but invested. And now I'm going to answer your question. The thing we look for is second-time founders who had a modest M&A exit. It's one thing if you've got second-time founders who maybe built a $40 billion company and they have the summer house, the third wife, want to go play in LA. But second, but second-time founders who had a modest exit have gotten a little taste of success. Maybe they sold too early, and the second time they're real serious.\n\nAnd now look here, the second time was an M&A. It's the largest M&A in a for a private company ever done. It's still an M&A. You know, who knows what could have happened to if we had kept it private, maybe would be much bigger, but a $32 billion with with a founder and a board just motivated because it was a great price, we decided to sell. But we look for the second-time founders, not who had a smashing success the first time, but who had a modest success.\n\nBecause Yeah. When you had that modest success, you still got a little fire.\n\nYeah, you sold too early. A little chippy. Something still to prove, but you got that taste.\n\nYeah, I liked it.\n\nUh, and it's worth pointing out, Don Valentine, for those youngans listening to the program, founder of Sequoia from the Bronx, um, from Brooklyn. Both of us went to Forom. He, uh,\n\nYes.\n\nNew York.\n\nYeah. Uh, and, uh, he always had this amazing, um, 4x4 quadrant that he would explain to young folks at Sequoia. Agreeable, disagreeable, competent, not competent. This uh where we make our money as venture capitalists. So I guess the punchline, and I don't remember the quadrant, was all the adjectives that people throw at founders, irreverent, doesn't listen. Those are things we look for. Uh, and quite frankly, those are the traits the Sequoia partners have. Uh, and so we look for those outliers. We look for those people that are special in some ways. Uh, they're outliers. Uh, and they can be outliers in drive, in intellect, and knowledge in some ways. And they're missiles. And our job as venture capital, let them do their black magic because that's the part that we can't do. But then help them build a business, take this incredibly raw asset. And if you think of the people coming out of 8,200, they're not only in Israel, but they're far away from the market. And they and they haven't been a commercial near a commercial enterprise. It's not that they worked at a tech company for 5 years and have seen something. And so the magic that they do, we can't replace you. We can't come close. What Gili and I do is the mere mortal stuff is the are the things based on many years of experience. When do you hire your first salesperson? What does your first CRO looks like? When do you inject product marketing? Those are the kinds of things that I think would become the very best in the world at doing, and I and I would Gillian along with Sequoia.\n\nHey founders, I want to share with you an experience I love. It's when I get an ad that is relevant and not some nonsense. Like the other day I got an ad for a fund management platform, and it was like a new one I'd never heard of. I clicked on the ad because well I managed four venture capital firms. We scheduled a call with them, and it was amazing. How did this happen? Well, I was on LinkedIn because I like to share links from the podcast This Week in Startups right on LinkedIn. In fact, we live streamed to LinkedIn 3 days a week, and we get a great audience over there, and I happen to be presented with this fund management platform, and it was a direct hit. Like I mean, talk about hitting the bullseye. If you're in business and you're making a product or service, it's really hard to find customers in the business-to-business space. And doing B2B advertising is hard, but LinkedIn makes it so easy because, you know, their tools let you target people by job title, industry, company size, and more. So, this fund management platform obviously was looking for people in venture capital who had a fund size and a number of people, maybe 10 people, maybe 50 people. And they found me. They got me. They split the arrow. Boom. Right on target. And there's two things you really need to know about LinkedIn going into 2025. First, they broke a billion members, and 130 million of those billion are decision-makers, and 10 million of the billion are sea-level executives like myself. Where can you get to those people? It's really hard. And the second thing you need to know, LinkedIn makes an impact. B2B marketers report two to five times higher return on ad spend or ROAS, return on ad spend. You should know that acronym compared to other social platforms. 79% of B2B marketers say LinkedIn is the best platform for paid media. LinkedIn's going to let you build the right relationships. It's going to drive results, and you're going to reach your customers in a super respectful business environment. It's not a place where people are dancing around saying inappropriate things or debating politics. Nope. LinkedIn equals business. Business equals LinkedIn. Start converting your B2B audience into high-quality leads today. We'll even give you a $100 credit on your next campaign. Go to linkedin.com/thisweekstartups to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/thisweek in startups. Terms and conditions do apply. Julie, these uh tactical strategic important parts of the playbook. Um, these things founders haven't done in some cases. So when they come to them, they might, if they're irreverent, if they're a rule breaker, they might want to reinvent it. So maybe you could talk a little bit about that conversation of the founder wants to do something non-traditional.\n\nYou don't want to squash the non-traditional, but hey, you probably don't want to get too creative with legal and accounting and the HR department, and maybe on the margins, they want to totally reinterpret things that, you know, maybe the SEC or the IRS don't want reinterpreted. So, maybe you can take us through some of those conversations you've had and and when to let the founder run a muck and and innovate and when to tell them, hey, let's just do this one by the books and and save the innovation for the the product.\n\nYeah, absolutely. And as you mentioned, I spent nearly a decade with Sequoia Capital before I started branched out at Cyber and started Cyberstarts. And one of the learnings I had was that, you know, we spend a, you know, specifically at the very early stage, at the seed stage, we spend so many calories on product ideas and technologies and markets that do not exist because within 3 weeks it would be something else, regardless of what the founders have told you, and then 3 weeks later it would be something else again. So at Cyberstarts, I became a complete purist on that, and I stopped asking, asking any questions about technologies, product, or market, focused solely on the talent, and Wiz is a great example for that, where, you know, they started with a different name for the company called Beyond Corp, different idea, and you know, within 60 days after having a series of conversations with security practitioners, with chief information officers and chief information security officers, they switch their idea to cloud security, and the rest is history. And we had those conversations to begin with just to make sure that they are not locked on the idea and understand that we are locked on the team, but it doesn't happen, you know, there are cases where founders had had have been right with the idea from day one. You know, speaking about another terrific company Doug and I invested in called Island, these guys came to us with the idea to build an enterprise browser, and that was a shocking concept for us. Does the world need another browser? And it turns out that yes, the answer is yes. So specifically inside an enterprise where that is the number one attack vector you can contain. I remember hearing that pitch back in the day, and I was like, a new browser? Yeah, that's necessary. And it was it was a really great pitch.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah. So I I don't think there's a cookie cutter for that as long as you keep, you know, true, honest conversation with with the founders and you you train them not what to do, but what questions to ask and to keep their ear muscle flexed enough to to listen well and adapt. I think that's that's the key lesson.\n\n\nFrom those experiences. You see the founders are super smart, and we learn from founders recruiting from Google. You know, we have all these lessons that we borrow from one company, if you will. We're inspired, if you're in the jewelry business, by one company, and we bring it to another. But the thing you don't want to do is pull the rug from under the founder. So if we talk about the case of Wiz, the operating plan that was put in front of us was absurd, or it looked absurd. I mean, revenue growth of that magnitude, we hadn't seen it. I had never seen it before. So the deal we cut with a team is, let's make sure we have linear headcount increase. You keep on making quarters. We keep on doing this what looks like an absurd looking headcount. And yet they made quarter. Actually, they beat quarter after quarter, and so retrospectively, it didn't look so absurd. Uh, you know, the fastest company to, whether it was 100, 200 million in bookings and so on, but that was the courage and the vision of yet another way to do things. And so to me, you want to let the founder run unless it's something extremely silly, like you said in finance, we don't want creativity in finance. Uh, but here we have creativity in the speed of go to market. It was really, really fast.\n\nWhat was that secret? What was the go-to-market secret? They discover vision, exquisite timing, and product-market fit. That's the only way you can get away with that because the product has to fly off the shelf. Uh, but I insisted in linear headcount growth so we could have a check off every quarter. So we would hire 500 salespeople. I'm making up the number right now, and find out that no one's selling and that we're stuck. If you want to hire 500 salespeople, let's get to it by the end of the year, but let's hire, if you will, a hundred a quarter. Again, these are not the real numbers, but it just makes the case. So, so we can preserve cash in case we're off a little, in case we didn't hit the bullseye. In the case of Wiz, they completely hit the bullseye. If you think of an arrow and a bullseye, they could not have hit the middle any better. Uh, but even some of the other companies, I would say that Island has done that. Sierra, which is another data security company, uh, they didn't hit the bullseye right away. We had, uh, we had the board meeting. Oh my god, the business plan made sense, but people don't seem to be interested in securing their data. That lasted two quarters, and then the world exploded. Everybody wanted to secure everything, and but that wasn't one that from day one it hit. It took 60 days for the market to come around, or maybe a quarter and a half for the market to come around. Uh, and now that company's running extremely fast. And so, but the trick is, let the founders do their thing and just install some guardrails so you can protect the company. Let's talk about product-market fit. How do you know, Gili, when you've got the start of product-market fit, and then all the way at the end is you're taking orders, the phone's ringing, the product's flying off shelves, you show up at the storefront and there's 10 people in line already. You know, you got the best bagels in Brooklyn when people are there and you sell out by noon, you know, but it's a journey to get there. So maybe let's talk a little bit about that journey and the iterative process, and then when the founders actually know they're sort of tipping in from having to call a customer and convince them and do a long sales cycle to, you know, how many would you like, and then, you know, eventually, uh, they just come running in the store and just self-order.

Um, I call it company-market fit because it's much bigger than just a product exercise. Um, at those companies at Wiz, Island, Sierra, uh, we had the founders, uh, run a process we call Sunrise, which takes 9 to 18 months. So it's a long process where you go and ask all the tough questions about your company in a way you are going out and breaking your company every week and then fix it and break it again, and you address questions like, you know, what would make people move faster to procurement with me, not just what's their biggest pain or would they buy it? Would they spend money on it? But what would make them run super fast with me? You know, what are the right channels? How would they evaluate the product? So, in a way, it's a simulation for the founders of everything that can go bad for this company in the next three years. But you do that in a very condensed time frame, you know, which is something like 12 months, and if you do that right, and if you ask all the tough questions and you challenge yourself and you challenge your customers. So in a typical sales cycle, in a typical sales call, you know, you don't present your competitive product. If a, you know, if the prospect is happy, you are rushing to get an order. In a Sunrise, even if the prospect is happy, you present the competitive products and ask them why wouldn't you buy from the competition, for instance. So you are breaking the company and then fixing it, and the outcome are companies that are perfectly matching the market. So a company like Wiz can conclude that process and then go and and and really run as faster than any company has done before, or a company like Island or a company like Sierra. You look at those companies, they run faster than anything else than any of the other players in the market. And the reason is that those companies, not just the products, are perfectly matching the market.\n\nTakes a little bit of courage, huh, Doug, to ask, wow, you know, what's going to kill this company? What, where are the breaking points? Where are our competitors actually better than us?\n\nWell, so I have a visual that I tell to founders. I said your company's a river, and there are rocks in a river, and your job is to remove the rocks and let that water flow as fast as possible. And we built a methodology at Sequoia called the merchandising cycle that that goes from product management to product marketing to demand generation to sales. And the trick is to debug this merchandising cycle backwards. Why isn't the sale going fast enough? Oh, because we don't have enough leads. That's the answer you get. Okay, let's get some BDRs. Let's hire some more BDRs. Well, now they get the budget and you have the conversation. You find out, well, you know, it's not a matter of more BDRs. The pro, the story is not resonating. Ah, okay. Let's keep, let's debug into marketing. Now, we're in product marketing. We're the leader of, and you go online and you type the category, and they just showed up on page one, page two, page three of Google in SEO. Well, if you don't shop on page one, you might as well be in the final scene of the Raiders of the Lost Ark, if you're old enough to know what I'm talking about. You know, the warehouse scene. Yeah, your warehouse scene where you're lost forever. Sometimes it's product management, and it's never engineering. Sooner or later, the product goes work, and it's often the vision. But assuming the vision's right and the and the product works, you've got to debug this merchandising cycle from sales on backwards so you can run like a bat out of hell. So that that stream, that water can come down as fast as possible, and that is the exercise that we bring that we ask our founders to go do. You know, why is it that the plan is the plan? Why is it you want the net new ARR to triple next year? Why can't it be four times, 5x, just as a thought exercise? And usually it's market size, it's cash, it's unit economics on each sale, maybe they're horrible, and you don't want to go any faster. And what it's often is Mandarin's ability to manage maximum growth because these are young executives. These are young founders, and so once we get on that beaten the issue, then how do we surround them with the right people so they can go faster? And that's what we do as board members.\n\nYeah. And this um process of understanding who the right talent is, this is always a crucible moment uh for a founder. Gosh, I brought a team together. These are all my friends. We went to college together, or we worked on this previous two projects together. But listen, the this drummer is not able to drum at the pace we need. We need a better drummer. And this is where hard conversations that boards happen. How do you manage that piece? Uh, Jill, and then I'll come back to you or or Doug, you can take it if you want. The hard conversations about talent.\n\nSo I'll start, and Gilly should give the long answer. To me, it starts with a founder equity split because I tell them, you don't get that right, somebody's going to leave the company because the other founders are going to get upset about it. So, have a very honest conversation on what you all bring to the table and get that equity split right because if you all go uh the kumbaya third, a third, a third, it's never third, a third, a third in talent. It turns out one person usually has, you know, or maybe two people have talent. We often see two founders 50/50 where it makes sense. But the moment you have more founders where n is three or above, those equity splits are usually off, and we ask them to think about that good and hard so we can retain these founders because there's no faster way than a founder to be removed by other founders to have a huge equity share and not carrying anywhere that level of load. So we ask them to be thoughtful at that point among them. It's not for us to opine. And then there's everything else. People in a company that Gilly can address that.\n\nYou know, it's kind of interesting. It turns out the uh Steph Curry doesn't get paid the same amount as the five players on the bench on the Warriors. Yeah. They all have different salaries based on their performance. But a hard conversation to have, I think, uh Gilly, because people go socialist. Hey, yeah, we have three founders, that's 33% each, or it's four of us, it's 25% each. Clearly, that's going to rub some people the wrong way when the fourth one doesn't show up for work. You know, when I was much younger, Doug taught me one uh, you know, one lesson, which is, you know, there are many ways to to hell, but there's more than one way to to heaven, which means in this case that I'm not sure there's a one great way to to address it. Um, you know, take for instance, uh, we you have four equal partners and amazing partnership and you know, wonderful company, and we had uh portfolio companies where uh founders uh departed for whatever reasons. Uh, I think it all comes back to having true partnership with with the founders. It starts in in day one, and and the same uh transparency and and honest conversation about products, about markets, you know, goes uh also uh to to the essence and the core of of of the partnership uh among the founders. And if you if you have established that level of trust with with the founders, and that what early stage investors like Doug and myself, you know, practice, if you if you establish that level of trust with the founders, you know, you could you can resolve any situation. And you know, whenever you have people, you'll have social situations that you need to resolve. There's there's no way to avoid. Yeah, humans are human, and they're going to do human things. But I love the idea of like, hey, let's talk about the equity split because now the entire formation of the company, Doug, is being the foundation is performance and what do we get if we perform as opposed to everybody just gets what they get. It's it's just a math equation as opposed to a value-based equation. Yeah.\n\nOne of the themes we talk about over and over again on This Week in Startups is making sure you do your chores. I'm no expert on these things. I have some experience. Steven Estus from CLA is an expert. Let's talk about being cash efficient. Tell us about efficiency and what you see in the in the top-tier startups in your practice.\n\nWe're seeing kind of an interesting trend out there where companies aren't needing to raise quite as much as they had in the past. You really have to be careful as a founder to only take on as much money as you really need. You got to do the forecast and you got to do the modeling and you got to dial it in and get it right. Otherwise, you're going to end up either not raising enough capital to get to where you're going and you're going to have to go get venture debt or go back have an extender to the round, or you're going to give up too much of the company because you just didn't recognize how much money you actually needed.\n\nYeah. Very important to get this stuff right, folks. And that's really a bummer when startups don't do things in a button-up. They always have a great partner, a good partner to have on this adventure. While things change, my friend Steven over at CLA. Visit claon.com/tech. And don't forget to mention that your boy Jal sent you. That's cla.com/te. Start today.\n\nYeah. Look, the things get interesting more when you start asking questions of who do you bring in when, you know, what should your salesperson look like? And the answer, the short answer is never suits. The short answers is catching talent on their way up and hire, hire for uh, uh, smarts, hire for hunger, uh, and a bit of experience. I'd\n\n\nRather have that than a whole bunch of experience and all the downsides that go with that.\nBut by plugging in this outside talent, imagine you have four founders even in Wiz.\nJust imagine you have a closed circuit.\nBy definition, you have four people that are like brothers that we're at Adalam.\nNow, how do you integrate outside expertise to that so they feel part of that team?\nThat takes conversations, that takes skills, that takes the board being aware of that issue, that takes the four founders being aware of that issue, trust between the founders of the board because that is not an easy thing.\nAnd when you make a mistake, you recognize it quickly and you move on.\nAnd it's really that simple.\nI think unpacking, there's like an important piece to unpack that you said there, Doug, which is, and having been on a couple boards here and seen this movie, there's some incredible salesperson.\nThey look incredible on paper.\nThey show up.\nThey've had four, you know, top tier jobs.\nThey've got the cuff links.\nThey've got this polish, but they're not hungry anymore.\nThey're negotiating their exit package on the way in.\nThat's their focus.\nBut this is critical.\nLike the person is coming up.\nThey've got enough experience.\nThey've got but they still have the hunger and they're not kind of just uh delegating work and uh maybe more concerned with the accoutrements of the executive position.\nYeah.\nSo, I've been shocked by people that can sell $8 million a year at a major tech company and can't sell $500,000 a year for a startup.\nThat is one of the problems.\nThe other problems of people that have sold widget versus solutions.\nA widget is a straightforward sales, a solution.\nYou have to understand the bigger picture.\nI've been shocked at that.\nUh, and so those are the mistakes that we try not to make.\nAnd the other thing is what does your first VP sales or head of sales as we call them early on look like?\nIs he someone that has managed 200 million or someone that's managed 30 million?\nYou can't get to person that's managed 200 million because that person you have no customers.\nYou may have three customers maybe.\nAnd so there are these uh there are these steps you take.\nYou know, at Snowflake, the first person they hired who was a fairly low-level sales manager ended up running all of sales.\nUh, and he rose.\nAnd it's our hope when we hire these people that they go all the way, but often they have to make a stop and become a regional manager, maybe stop there to get some experience.\nWe hire someone over them.\nSo those are the things we we get to do.\nUh and to convince our founders that's how you should build a team.\nUh and we do that often.\nGilly, tell me a little bit about secrets to recruiting you've learned uh the hard way.\nYou know, people who look great on paper or hey, they were at, you know, whatever company, Microsoft, Salesforce, whatever they were selling all this stuff, but it had more to do with that company and their product-market fit than maybe the grit, right, of that individual salesperson.\nAnd then also, I think it's a really interesting topic of integrating people into the team and making them feel that they're part of the team even though, you know, they came from the outside.\nMaybe they weren't part of the formation of the company, but you got to make them feel that they're really part of something.\nIt reminds me of Kevin Durant coming to the Warriors who never quite felt like he was part of the core, right?\nYeah, absolutely.\nAnd you know, I'll take even a step backwards and and and mention that many of those cyber security all those cyber security companies that Doug and I invested together, I think those are seven companies by now, they all started in Tel Aviv with an office that's mostly R&D.\nSo for many companies when you build an office you build actually the DNA you know you have a center of gravity for that for that company and you build your DNA once and once you you have 50 maybe 100 maybe 200 employees most of them in the office you've got the company's DNA for those companies that coming out of Tel Aviv you have to do to do this DNA uh buildup twice because you build the DNA in Tel Aviv.\nMaybe you've got it right, but then you know you need to build another office maybe in New York, maybe in San Francisco, maybe in another location.\nSo, you've got to go through that exercise twice, which makes it, you know, riskier and and and definitely more difficult.\nUh and there are many reasons why I've seen uh new hires that have done amazingly well in in previous lives and didn't do well.\nYou know, maybe they they were younger and hungrier.\nMaybe, you know, they work with a different set of founders that brought different set of qualities to the table.\nUh I think when it comes to you know to hiring especially you know the the first line of executives it goes back to to first principles you know how um high energy you know energy is so important uh for for early stage company you know because you're going to fail a lot you're you know early stage is all about failing learning and fixing.\nUh so high energy, high intelligence and terrific teamwork and if you go back to those first principles, you'll do, you know, you have higher likelihood to do well.\nDoug, I want Okay, Doug, you want to add something to that?\nYeah.\nSo, I hate giving away my secrets on these podcast and I I've known you for a long time, Jason.\nSo, for example, when I'm recruiting against a Google, okay?\nI say to the candidate, \"My god, working at Google is fabulous.\"\nI said, \"The food, have you seen the food at Google?\nIt's ranch meat.\nHave you seen those colors?\nIt's always red, yellow.\nThey have those beautiful colors.\nThey have bicycles.\nThe campus is a blast.\nThey pay a lot better.\"\nYeah.\nNot a thing you can do to drive the price of that stock by one penny.\nYou're you're a small cog in a large machine.\nLet me tell you about our company.\nIn our company, the food stinks.\nIt rains when it's sunny and outside.\nIt rains even indoors at times.\nWe don't pay that well.\nYeah, you you're going to get stocked, but if you have an idea at 10:00, we could implement it at 10:30 and you can change the course of the company.\nSo, go look in a mirror and tell me what kind of human being you are.\nAnd if you're interested in our job, come talk to us again.\nAnd that's I recruit against the big companies.\nI force these people to have it come to Jesus with themselves, whether they're just are done in life basically or they want to do something.\nMissionary.\nYeah.\nOr mercenary.\nYeah.\nLike if you're just going there for the food and the steak and you getting your RSUs.\nThey really have.\nIt's so interesting how big tech has created this rest invest culture, you know, even lampooned on the HBO show Silicon Valley with the Hulie company.\nIt's like and Google was such an intellectual powerhouse, but when things get big, it is to your point like how do you make an impact?\nIf you're going to go work at Facebook for Zuckerberg, he has to offer you these crazy incentives as AI versus going and working for Elon or, you know, some other company that's got grit and is just starting, you know, from the beginning.\nYeah.\nYeah, that's exactly right.\nLook, a new hire can shift the trajectory of one of our little companies uh for the better or for the worse.\nYeah.\nUh but they'll have impact.\nYeah.\nI I I want to talk about revenue quality.\nI know it's like a kind of a boring subject, but it is one of the things I've seen is so profound.\nWe have these companies that appear to be rocket ships.\nThey're getting elevation and looks like they're going to get to, you know, orbit and then all of a sudden it explodes, goes off and you're like, what happened?\nAnd you look at the revenue quality and churn, not profitable, etc.\nDoug, how do you assess the quality of the revenue of a company and if that needs to be fixed, you know, at the early stages?\nAnd I see it today with AI, and I think we saw it with apps for a little bit.\nPeople would sample a lot of different products, but they didn't actually use them.\nAnd AI, I'm seeing this all over the place.\nPeople will spend $300 or $400 on an AI product for the year, put it on their corporate card, and then they never use it.\nSo, there's many answers to that.\nFirst of all, there are transient markets like we saw with these apps where things exploded.\nThe internet got so big, you have enough people trying things that that looked like momentum.\nUh, and you and if you probably had an AI engine analyzing the quality of revenue, you probably would have been told that.\nUh, but but even if you had a brain, you could have known that.\nThe other though that we found in the enterprise where Gilly and I spent a lot of our time is these companies that sold to other little tech companies.\nThe company formation was so rapid for such a long time that companies got revenue by just selling to all the other little companies and as long as the venture investors were funding and so on.\nNow, superimpose that to the fact that you start usually at the low end, the mid-range and then you get pulled up market.\nIn order to sell to the enterprise, you have to earn the right to sell to the enterprise.\nAnd to me, revenue quality uh starts being interesting.\nEven if you start on low end, but now you get dragged up.\nI remember when we looked at Figma.\nFigma, yeah, it all started with credit cards, people buying it, but now you saw people saying, \"I want 5,000 licenses.\nCan you send a sales rep over?\"\nHoly cow, we didn't have a salesman.\nIt was PLG, you know, uh, we we better hire some enterprise sales reps.\nAnd so, yeah, you've got to be careful in the enterprise of the low-end selling to other tech companies or people trying things for the heck of it.\nAnd you've got to look for those leading indicators, you know, a few companies sticking their neck out and wanting to to spend a lot more money.\nAnd then you know that you have something.\nAnd then the low end becomes a lead gen vehicle.\nIt doesn't become revenue.\nIt looks like revenue, but it's really lead gen for everything else.\nYeah, Gilly, it seems like founders sometimes they run learn the wrong lessons.\nThey're hackers and uh, you know, I won't mention any specific, you know, startup accelerators, etc., but I remember we had to learn this lesson as pre-seed investors.\nWhen they would show us their first 10 companies, we'd be like, \"Oh, that's pretty promising.\"\nThen we said, \"Well, can you just in the Google sheet when you send us the 10 companies, what date they started?\nYou know, were they did they use the product and how did you source them?\nAnd you know, we had one company was like, \"Yeah, these seven came were our in our accelerator and these three were our fraternity brothers.\"\nAnd we're like, \"Have you tried to sell to somebody on LinkedIn like a cold email or did anybody Google you and find your product?\"\nAnd yeah, so the sources of the company, the the the customers was how we unraveled this little gamesmanship that was occurring.\nBut maybe some thoughts on the quality of revenue, Gilly.\nSo maybe I'll add two two insights to that.\nUm because I thought that Doug's answer was perfect.\nUh one is um most of the companies all of the companies we we invest in in cyber security are B2B software companies.\nUm and they're all approaching new market solving new problems.\nSo you can go up market, down market, enterprise, SMB, you know, everything is open and our recommendation is always to start with the more difficult uh longer um uh journey which is to sell to to larger organizations.\nSo just go right to the pain.\nGo right to the hardest task.\nGo to the most sophisticated buyers and users because if they buy it and if they use it, everyone else would follow.\nAnd that's why you see the first deal of Sierra was a company that bought it for $400,000.\nThe second deal at Wiz was a million dollars.\nUh the third deal at Island was half a million dollars.\nSo those are large organizations sophisticated users and they do a lot of diligence before they they add a new product to to their arsenal and that is terrific for the founders although it looks more difficult on the surface and it's great for investors to build confidence in the team and in the product.\nThe other insight is that in many of those companies once they get to 10 20 logos so it's not about the first few deals but once they get to some number of deployments you know our ask at the board is that first slide would be usage not a show usage and if you see us you know if you see the usage graph going like steady not growing that's a major red flag.\nSo usage adaption stickiness are in that stage super important.\nWe have a company we have a company called Zaffron that uh the first few customers are all four $500,000.\nA lot of it happens because it's the founders who sell those deals.\nAnd then you start bringing the mere mortals, the sales rep.\nSuddenly you may see then the next 10 deals being 150k cuz now the found you know one of the things that we look for is a repeatable sales model.\nWhen is the first deal the founder doesn't have to be involved and it turns out the founders are often the best salespeople.\nYeah.\nThe there's an authenticity and a transference of enthusiasm when the founders in the room explaining why they made something that you could feel the enthusiasm just go right across the table or in nowadays the zoom to the customer where they're like I want to be part of this I want to be part of this new paradigm.\nYeah.\nAnd how do you get sales people to have that same level?\nI want to talk a little bit about sort of our jobs as investors and the game on the field.\nThe number of uh and it seems like it's because of AI but obviously cloud computing over the years uh we work and and office sharing everything has made the cost of starting a company go down um and the the skill levels going up and the ability to to get the first product out the door.\nSo what are we seeing in terms of team size Gilly and what it takes to stand up a product today versus 10 20 years ago?\nBut even in the last two years with AI sort and these AI solutions coming it feels like my lord some\n\n\nCompanies are getting to their first million with just a handful of people at the company. So, are you seeing that as well, game on the field?\n\nLook, I think we're still really early on in a cycle, but the trend is there, and we would see companies getting to milestones like the first 10 customers, the first million dollars, the first hundred million of ARR with a lower number of employees, and it would not just be for building products. It's everything around that. It's the design, the customer success support, BDR, and maybe five years into the future, sales. So, I think that the day where we would see the one-employee company with a million-dollar ARR is very, very soon. I think that time we would see maybe the less than 100 employees company with a hundred million of ARR is probably. Yeah, it's happening. Yeah, some of these companies are catching fire. It's behind the corner. Yeah, some of these co-pilots like Kurser had hit pretty crazy revenue numbers with even more than a million dollars per person, Doug. And you've got enough history in the business to have watched this trend, you know, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, YouTube, just Instagram, you guys were investors in that as well. You know, large number of users, large amounts of revenue coming in with a small number of employees. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Maybe that's going to happen in consumer. And we've all heard what Toby at Chapify said, \"I won't give you any tech headcount unless you can prove to me it can't be done with AI.\" But that's a mature company. I actually have a contrarian here. Yes, we can do more with less cost of cloud computing, blah, blah, blah, but we also have to run a heck of a lot faster than we ever had to. There used to be a time, I don't want to outdate myself here, where we could build a product, get our first few customers, take our time, hire two salespeople, get the US profitable, maybe we'd go to Europe. Can't do that anymore because if you would do that, it's going to take you three years, you'll have 23 competitors. The speed of company building has gotten so fast that we have to hire headcount. And also, if you're selling to the enterprise, the enterprise is not interested in a one-man vendor. The enterprise wants to see bodies, wants to see support. Try dealing with purchasing. You know, like after you've sold your product, now you've got to go fight another war with purchasing. Try doing that with an AI agent and see how far that goes. So, I think we got to segregate the B2B and B TOC. I think we're going to see some of these smaller companies in B TOC before we see them in B2B. And yes, once you reach the scale of Wiz or Sierra, now we can talk about efficiency in engineering, in R&D, you know, and so on. But when you've got the first three guys working until midnight trying to build a product, I don't think an AI engine is going to help you that much. That's just my view.\n\nYeah. Let's talk a little bit about this concept of overfunding companies. It happens every 5-10 years. New entrants come in, venture tourists, Doug, they start dumping money on top of, you know, companies that we've, you know, really been thoughtful about building, and founders, of course, look at it and go, \"Hey, Doug Gilly, I've been offered this crazy, you know, check with no board seat, no information rights. I've never heard of this firm, or maybe they do public stocks and now they're dipping into privates.\" Um, and that created quite an overhang in the SAS space. CI Gilly, like where we had maybe companies get overfunded, and then you have, you know, some members of the board who invested at, you know, $2 billion, and the other ones invested at 200 million, and the companies in between those two realities, and then it becomes a lot of hand-wringing and pain, yeah, and suffering. Maybe where are we at in that part of the cycle, Gilly? Seems like people are getting super excited again, just this year.\n\nYeah. If my view is that the venture business is a complex business, and if it was easy, then everyone would do that. So, some of the complexity is to keep the balance between the need for speed and then not, you know, throwing too much money on a company, and that's a fine balance because I, in my experience, that is that in order to build a large, important, sustainable business, definitely in cyber security, which is my focus, that's an expensive exercise. It's expensive. You need to build a massive amount of code and products, an army of people to sell and support the product. It's an expensive exercise. So, money and sufficient capital for the company early on, that's really important. Um, but you're right, there are tourists. There are all kind of unhealthy situations, and again, it goes back to the same elements I've touched earlier, which is, you know, having an honest, transparent conversation with the founders, and they may have all type of temptations, and you simply address that through a conversation. And if you've built the trust, and if you are fair as an investor, you know, the founders would listen.\n\nDoug, we've seen this movie over and over again. So, you're going to find my answer sarcastic. First of all, the sham of the SCAM that is called venture capital. Let's take a look at this. We get paid, we raise money for which we get paid fees for the pleasure of investing the money. If we lose the money, so what? And if we make money, we get to keep somewhere between 20 and 30%. You wonder why the balance between greed and fear always lean towards greed. A much more fair review would be, \"Here's the money, no fees, and you have to match dollar for dollar what you raise with your own money.\" Now you would see the greed and fear balance. So, already you have this proclivity to lean in because of the compensation structure. Point one. Point two, we have seen every generation, and by the way, I know my partners, or certainly in Sequoia, marketing won't be happy that I said all that, but who cares? You know, I'm old enough that I can say that. Second, we've seen every wave to be stronger and stronger. If we just look at the internet wave, 1995 when Netscape goes public, 1999, two great companies get built, then, \"Oh my God, the internet is a fraud,\" 9-10 years death, and then here we go again. Mobile, there wasn't a 10-year gap. There was a two-to-three or four-year gap between the head fake and reality. And I think AI is going to give us even a smaller head fake. So, I think the opportunity in front of us is huge. So, you have a proclivity to lean in by the money and the fact that we know each wave is bigger, is quicker and quicker, and bigger and bigger. And so, I think we're in for quite a show, actually. And the trick is to pick them, though, right? Because if you invest in everything, you're going to get nailed. And so, like everything else, it's a pick-them business. And we do know that if you pick them right, chances are it doesn't matter which round you came in. But I'd also urge all your listeners to think about all the dead FMV, all the dead companies that exist. Think about the thousands of companies that have revenue run rates 30 million, growing to 33 million, who are being carried on their books maybe at 120 million value, and they're really worth nothing. And so, as you think about leaning in and doing something silly like some venture investor did four, five, three, four years ago, I won't name any names, who had a theme investing in everything, you're going to get nailed. And so, there are all these great forces, and the trick is just being in the right one. There's two or three or four investments a year that matter, and be those, and you'll do just fine.\n\nYeah. And that is overindexing on the companies that lose. Even though your reputation is kind of built with those founders, right? We talked earlier about second-time founders, kind of a sweet spot, you know, and sincerely investing in teams. Your reputation in some ways is made equally by the companies that don't make it. But obviously, the power law defines, you know, by definition, is one or two companies per fund determine the fund success.\n\nLook, the real tough thing is do what Gilly and I do, and that is pick them early. Find them early. I mean, it's easy to find Wiz at the 10 billion round. You know, it was a made company. And the question on that point was, \"Am I going to make twice our money or six, seven times our money?\" And nobody knew. And you buy yourself either a poster or a small return and a poster. The real trick is getting there as early as you can.\n\nYeah. And that is a function of how your reputation, your deal flow, how many companies you meet with, and your ability to actually identify talent. Yeah, Doug.\n\nYeah. It's, and I might add a little luck, you know, a little luck does help. You know, I made a trip to Israel. Yes, may have been a fake Don Valentine, but that trip to Israel is what eventually got Assaf to say, \"I'd like Doug on a board.\" So, there's all this serendipity that has happened throughout my life. The Ron Conway call on Google. You know, Ron and I became friends, God knows from where, we share maybe one glass of wine, white wine, too many, but that led to a Google call. And so, these things happen, and you just got to do the right thing for years. Make sure you do the right thing by others. And if you do that, chances are you're going to get some calls at the right time. It really is like your reputation and the effort you put in. Saying yes to a couple of random things works. I was at a party once, not to make it about myself, and somebody said, \"You got lucky investing in Uber.\" And I said, \"Yeah, you're right.\" And Travis was standing next to me, and he said, \"Uh, I'm going to stop you right there. You don't know this, but JCAL helped me on my first two companies, Scour and RSO. And whenever I needed help, he was always picked up the phone, and he always took me out to dinner and talked to me about my companies. All of that is why he got that investment.\"\n\nExactly. And you just, and you and I, Jason, that's how the relationship was built. You needed a little help. I gave you two hours of my time, maybe an hour, and now we have a relationship. And that's the way it's, and Gilly the same way.\n\nYeah. Uh, you know, Gilly and I are now friends, but that friendship was built by helping one another out. It's, I want to talk about firm building specifically because, you know, I have this podcast for selfish reasons. I love to talk, but it's also a great way to learn, and here I am. I got my own firm. I'm four fours in. And we're all seem to be getting earlier. Earlier seems to be the focus. It seems to be getting very crowded. Obviously, Series B is bonkers. Series A also getting very crowded. People want to take the whole round. So, we're all moving earlier. Sequoia's experimented with Arc. I'd like to hear how that's going. I know Gilead, your firm, you do some incubation. Maybe what have we learned about going earlier and maybe creating some programs for folks. Gilly, I'll start with you.\n\nSo, first of all, we don't do incubations.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe are dedicated to investing as seed investors. We are the first check with amazing teams that we believe can build important cyber security companies. Um, and the, you know, we started, you know, I started Cyberstarts, you know, in 2018. It was super small, super, super humble fund. We started with a first fund was $50 million, really small, solo GP, and then, you know, and invested in, I would say, nine teams out of those $50 million. And many people thought that my approach is complete craziness because you've seen a grownup writing large checks, multi-million dollars checks to young fellows without asking them what do they do. Um, and then three years later, the world found out that those nine companies valued at over $25 billion. That was a major branding event for Cyber Start. So, that's really helped Cyber Starts accelerate and and and build into a bigger operation. And today we have four GPs, four general partners on the ground in Israel and two operating partners in the US. We've raised multiple funds, more than $700 million.\n\nTalk about deal flow. How did you get those first nine, and then how do you get deal flow now? I mean, one of the things I've read is that early success in venture capital is a predictor of later success because the founders and the LPs all chase the people who have early success. So, there's some manifest destiny there, I guess, or some self-fulfilling prophecy. But the first nine, how do you source those companies? And then today, I'm sure the success of Wiz and Island and other companies drives founders to come to you because they want to have the investor who did Wiz. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And again, keep in mind that in our business, we are always as good as our next investment. So, having a wonderful portfolio, that's great, no complaints, but you always, you know, if you feel too comfortable, you already lost the game. So, um, the, you know, at Cyber Starts, the first batch of companies, we, you know, it was simply through the network of entrepreneurs I've already knew by then, you know, spending 10 years with nearly 10 years with Sequoia and being an entrepreneur and founder of two cyber companies beforehand, but they were mostly younger guys and girls out of 8,200 looking to build their first business, and they weren't, you know, 2018, keep in mind, cyber security wasn't cool. No, it was this, the opposite, you know, boring office within it, you know, nobody cared about cyber security. So, if you were, you know, a 25, 27 years old individual with a desire to build a cyber security company, and you had a vague idea what you'd like to build, you didn't have many options, so they found me, and I helped them to build those businesses. Now it's a little bit different. Um, and you know, we\n\n\nWe are very lucky to get um many entrepreneurs call us, but we still, as I said, we don't get ourselves too comfortable.\nWe work uh really hard to get ourselves in front of uh amazing founders.\nDoug, maybe you could talk about this uh getting earlier and earlier.\nSequoia's got a reputation of backing people before the product launches, doing series A's and obviously later stage funds now.\nUm maybe a little bit about the ARC program and and just how getting earlier is important today.\nUh maybe it's always been so many roads to heaven.\nYeah.\nUh you can make money at every stage.\nWe vertically integrated.\nWe had a seed fund, a venture fund, a growth fund, and a public market vehicle.\nSeed, we've done a number of seed.\nPala Networks was a seed.\nDoor Dash was a seed uh and many others.\nSeries A, Wiz Island, uh and so on.\nSeries B, Sierra kind enough, Gili gave me the call and so many others.\nGrowth just quickly.\nUh, you know, Zoom, Snowflake, and uh and even public Shopify.\nWe made as much money in Shopify in the public market.\nWe held that thing for, you know, we made a ton.\nUh, but when you get there early, you have a shot investing in every fund.\nOne, and two, you have a shot of really helping the founders set in the right footing.\nUnfortunately, the venture people, the venture industry has a lot of people, not everybody, but has a lot of people that are don't really have as much experience as you'd like.\nLet me just leave it at that.\nSo, we we do want to go early.\nThe ARC program uh has worked quite well for us.\nUh we've decided to limit it though, not to go and mass, not to have hundreds of companies because at the end of the day, uh you know, they all have your brand.\nThose are all founders that expect your help.\nLike like you can't say to an NRC company, okay, we're only going to give you an hour and a half.\nThat conversation is not a brand augmenting type of conversation.\nThat destroys your brand.\nAnd so we keep it tight, you know, whether it's 15, 20 companies a class, but that's worked well.\nBut we do try to be the first money in uh the first of seed or otherwise.\nAnd if we can't meet that, then we want to be the first series A money.\nUh because once you get to series B now the ownership comes down.\nLook the ownership has come down already a whole bunch.\nWe used to own 30% then 25 then 20.\nNow a series A may get you 15 points.\nUh and so it's really brutal.\nThe the venture industry was a niche business.\nNow it's a broad-based business and everybody in and their mother and fathers are venture investors.\nAnd so the thing we know is is to ingrain ourselves in the entrepreneurial type community and get there either as I think of it through a salesforce, our own partners or an indirect channel.\nYou can tell I'm a go to market guy.\nYou are direct channel Jason.\nYou call us things.\nGili's an indirect channel.\nAnd so we have both a direct and indirect channel.\nAnd we try to get to as many things as early as we can.\nAnd when we either miss them or make a mistake at the series A, we try to pass in the most elegant ways because we may want to catch them uh one round later.\nUh and so on.\nAmazing.\nAll right, listen.\nUh great job, gentlemen.\nUh let's do it again in a year.\nUh I'm going to book you both and we're going to check in uh both on your uh very uh modest retirement.\nDoug, this isn't a retirement.\nYou're working just as hard.\nYou're just as engaged.\nBad word.\nIt's a Yeah, you're just as engaged and look, you know, uh I I don't you you you look young and you look energetic.\nYou look vibrant.\nI think it's great uh that you're still in the game.\nI don't know about this.\nLike it's so weird that a lot of the firms have this like forced retirement at a certain age or these weird rules because we're all living so much longer and and your cognitive function is is continuing on.\nI don't know.\nThere's and there's all this wisdom to be passed down.\nSo, I just love the fact that you're still in the game, Gili.\nGreat to get to know you and uh I'll look forward to seeing you in the region the next time I'm over there.\nAnd we'll see you all next time on This Week in Startups.\nBye-bye.\n",
