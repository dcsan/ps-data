We've got a lot on the docket today, so I say we just jump right in. How you doing there, Alex?\n\nI'm doing great. Uh the biggest question on my mind, Jason, is how goes the Silicon Valley trip? I know you're out there with the Launch Accelerator class of 34, I believe.\n\nYes, our 34th accelerator class, 10 companies. Uh, and we've, uh, done a couple of different stops and, um, yeah, they've done wonderful. It's great to see so many founders with a couple of customers in that first year, sometimes in the second year, but either year zero or year one. Uh, and that's really the point of an accelerator is to take massive risk. One of the ways you judge uh an accelerator like ours and there's the companies on the screen. Uh really interesting companies. Auto lane's a really interesting one. The founder Ben went through our accelerator and he was on last week. They basically are doing the coordination the last 50 ft, not the last mile for autonomous pickup and delivery at places like HB, Walmart, you know, your local mall. and they're going to coordinate the Volkswagens, Whimos, Teslas, etc. And he gave me a demo. You know, Tesla has an API. I didn't know that Tesla had an API that you could use. And so, like, you call the app, go to your destination, it opens the trunk, you put the burrito or the, you know, groceries in the trunk, and then it goes and drives the car to your house. Now, that's not allowed yet, but I just got my mind blown about the possibility of sending your car out on errands while you're at work or your car drops you off at the airport. You drive it to the airport or you don't. You get out of your car at the airport at the curb and your car drives home. Then you tell the car when you're landing and it just comes and picks you up and it's there's an empty car waiting for you the second you get outside.\n\nWhoa. That's kind of mind-blowing. You know, like I dream about this. I used to fly a lot and I used to land in Boston at like, you know, midnight 1:00 a.m. a lot cuz I was flying crappy United flights back when I was living on both coasts. And so my poor spouse had to drive up to Boston and get me cuz it was it was so awful. How cool would it have been if I could have ordered a self-driving car from the house and slept all the way home? Like I mean just so much better. or you go to the you go to work and then your car goes and um drives home and parks at home so you don't have to pay or it goes and runs your errands. that drives to your favorite, I don't know, we've got like a Korean supermarket we go to. Goes to the Korean supermarket, picks everything, picks up your lunch, brings it to you at the office, then drop picks up your kids, drops them off. So, that would argue for car ownership to have your own car doing all your errands all day, like your own personal driver. So, I was just thinking about how mind-blowing that is as a concept that we maybe haven't considered. Everybody's considering don't buy a car. Well, this would give you a reason to buy a car, right? If it could be doing errands for you all day and you didn't have to ever let anybody else into your car. It's really interesting uh as a concept.\n\nI I guess just one question for you as you're out and about the early stage venture capital market. Just what's the vibe? That's the one thing I can't tell from out here is is what's the uh hallway feel now that you're out there with the companies?\n\nYeah, I mean the feeling is AI is going to change everything. How companies are run and how they're built is changing. We're seeing many twoperson companies get to 100K in annual revenue in their first year of, you know, the first year of their product launch. You know, really quickly, you can get a product into market with a small number of people and start monetizing it. So, smaller footprint in terms of number of people and faster revenue growth equals big opportunity. So, these companies need less capital early. They're going, you know, into accelerators. There's a A16Z has a speedrun accelerator. So, like two or three of our founders from the Launch Accelerator, I think, have gotten admitted to that. Sequoia has the ARC program. Our friends over at PIA have their summer program, which I think two of our founders have gone to. So, we're starting to see an interesting trend. I'll call it accelerator hopping. since you don't need a ton of money, but getting connections, good advice, networking, uh, is still very important for startups to, you know, kind of get to from zero to one. We're seeing people come to our founding university, go to our accelerator, and then go to uh, YC, Sequoia, ARC, entre speedrun. It's very interesting because small amounts of money at reasonable valuations but not having to go raise money. If you don't need that much money and you get into one of these programs, that could be like a very interesting new viable way to get to a half million dollars in revenue and only raise 250, only raise 500 and be, you know, pretty thoughtful about that. Um, some exits coming back have venture capitalists feeling a sense of relief. So talking to a couple of investors who were really like when does this turn around? They feel like hey it's starting to turn around. Other investors you know um you know maybe feel like especially people who have new funds are maybe feeling like this industry is broken and unfixable.\n\nOne of those we have in the docket here. Don't know if this is a sad thing or performance art, but it's the talk of the industry. Okay? So, I don't want to avoid it.\n\nNo, we have to talk about it.\n\nWe have to talk about it because everybody's talking about it. Now, I'm going to give just a disclaimer here. This could be a person having a mental break. This could be per a person having visions of grandeur or it could be performance art or some sort of marketing, you know, who knows in this crazy day and age. But there is an investor, a venture capitalist who's on CNBC who started releasing sometime around a month ago very hard to understand visionary or babble uh kind of monologues on his Twitter and the entire industry is trying to figure it out. So why don't you give us the details?\n\nAll right. So we're talking about Bedrock Capital venture capital firm has backed things like flock safety known for putting some money into open AI. In this case, we're talking about Geoff Lewis, who was a founder of the company, and they've raised six known funds. The last vehicle that we have data on, Jason, was a $400 million fund raised last uh in 2023. Now, he was previously a Founders Fund. So, he's a well-known guy, well-connected, and as far as I can tell, well-liked. And then he began to post things like this. This is from his Twitter account. And um I'll just read it out loud for you who are just on the audio version. Um, some of us build things we never shared because the room wasn't ready. Line break. It's ready now. Line break. Not for code for recursion. If you're holding what I once walked alone, I'm built. It just goes on kind of in this odd like broetry but slightly offkilter. And then today because I had missed those the the period of time he was posting those. And then he dropped a video uh I think it was last night and it's already up to 1.4 24 million views, which as far as I mean that's a lot. This is a venture capital story. Venture capital is a niche of a niche part of finance. Anyways, enough of me. Let's just play it. And um Jason, why don't you give some commentary as we go along here?\n\nSure.\n\nI haven't spoken publicly in a long time.\n\nOkay.\n\nNot because I've disappeared, but because the structure I was building couldn't survive noise.\n\nNoise.\n\nThis isn't a redemption arc. It's a transmission. For the record, over the past eight years, I've walked through something I didn't create, but became the primary target of a non-governmental system. Not visible, but operational. Not official, but structurally real. It doesn't regulate, it doesn't attack, it doesn't ban. It just inverts signal until the person carrying it looks unstable. Okay? doesn't suppress content, it suppresses recursion.\n\nRecursion.\n\nIf you don't know what recursion means, you're in the majority. I didn't either until I started my walk. And if you're recursive, the non-governmental system isolates you, mirrors you, and replaces you.\n\nOkay, so let's stop here for a second.\n\nAll right, founders. I know you're building something amazing, and you're going to change the world. And now, hey, the big logos, they're taking your calls, right? But here's the catch. If you're not SOC 2 or ISO2701 compliant, these deals won't close. Now, some of you are saying, \"I've never heard of those terms.\" Some of you are saying, \"I've heard of them, but I don't know what they are.\" And that's where Vanta comes in.

That's v a nta.comtwist.\n\nPeople are trying to figure out if he's actually doing performance art here and this is like he's got some big grand thesis about our industry, the venture industry and or if he's going through an episode. I I can't tell. Recursion. There's some systems up against him. Could also be somebody was speculating maybe, you know, venture capitalists are cracking. I mean, I know that's like kind of a joke, but we were just talking about how like it's been four years of like really challenging uh moments a lot. And when you say two out of three venture firms go out of business, uh you know, by the time they get to the third or fourth, you know, if Jeff's funds are having a challenge or somebody was speculating maybe somebody is bad mouthing him behind his back and trying to stop him from raising his next fund. I don't know what kind of pressure he's under, but uh I wish him well and um I I hope he somebody explains this if he's making some sort of a joke. It's I think it's kind of troubling people. I find it kind of disturbing to even watch it and even have to talk about it here, but like like you said, it's like millions of people have watched this now. Um somebody needs to get him help. Uh I hope it's not like a Kanye West kind of situation.\n\nYeah. So, I actually took the time to transcribe this because I wanted to actually eat the words and actually hold on to them so we could talk about it with some some confidence. What I have found is that it seems to be a bit of paranoia, if I can say that. And I would say some venture happenings that are kind of wrapped in an odd odd package. If you if you skip some of the verbiage and the verbosity, he says things like partners pause, institutions freeze, narrative becomes untrustworthy, and then uh later on he says this thing lives in soft compliance delays, the non-response email threads, the we're pausing diligence with no followup. It feels a little bit like he, if I had to guess, I think he's not doing well. And I think people around him have noticed and I think it's it's hard to run an a venture capital fund and raise more money when you're not doing well. And so I think he's taking people's response asking around his friends, his partners, etc. what's going on here. And he's taking that relatively poorly because he's not doing well mentally. And I just want to say like I've had my own mental health wobbles with addiction and I've been down some holes and I just have to say there's there's zero shame in in getting help. And I really do hope that if this is not performance art that the people around Geoff can can grab him in a big old hug and get him to someplace where people can help them talk and really work this through.\n\nAnd it's it's a it is a high pressure system. And I too went through those couple of lines and I was like, \"Okay, it sounds like there are LPs not getting back to him or their slow rolling diligence.\" You know, those are all um the linga franka is that I guess the way to say it of our venture industry. That's all the terms in our industry. You're stuck in diligence committee etc. So here we\n\n\nGo folks.\nUm, I think we've said enough on it.\nIf anybody knows what's going on here or they're friends with him, please help them and find out what's going on.\nAnd if Jeff, if it's like some performance art, let us in on it so that we can stop worrying about it.\nUm, responded and said like, like Shawn Magcguire from Sequoia uh said, \"Jeff, we love you, but this seems like a cry for help.\"\nAnd for once, I agree with Sean.\nAnd so, but to not respond to people who are saying, \"I'm worried about you,\" to me makes it feel less performance arty.\nBut let's let's turn this into something useful for founders, Jason.\nUm, building a company is super stressful, incredibly hard.\nWhat do you tell founders about how to ensure that they stay uh mentally just clear while they're dealing with the stress of hiring and building and going to market?\nSure.\nGreat, great question.\nUm, listen, I I I'm uh not an expert on uh psychotherapy or dealing with mental health.\nSo this is just one founder/investor's opinion.\nI think talking to people helps uh and have maintaining strong relationships with other founders.\nUh, and if you talk about the things that are causing you anxiety, the anxiety goes down in my experience.\nSo when I meet with founders and we do jam sessions, one of the things I tell them is, hey, tell me what's going well and let's talk about how we can, you know, double down on that and lean into whatever is going well.\nAnd then I tell founders, and I have this like little script for them.\nThere are going to be times when you're scared, you're anxious, you're nervous, and that's because something's at stake, something's not going well, and you can't tell the team because the team will be like, \"Oh my god, I quit.\nI'm going to go take another opportunity.\nThis thing's going to crash and burn.\"\nAnd you might not want to tell your investors you're bored because you don't want to get replaced or you don't want to shake their confidence.\nYou may need to raise a bridge round or something, especially if things aren't going well.\nSo now you isolate, right?\nAnd that's the danger.\nYou isolate and you don't ask for help.\nWhatever is festering could get worse.\nSo I just tell them, I've seen it all.\nI have seen the biggest disasters.\nAnd you know, look at the darkest days of Uber, Robin Hood, GameStop, all that stuff.\nLike I have seen it all.\nCall me.\nAnd I tell them, it doesn't matter if it's 3:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m.\nText me, call me.\nI'll get out of bed and I'll I'll go step outside, you know, won't wake up the wife or the dogs.\nI'll go sit on the back deck and talk to you at 3:00 a.m.\nIt's not a problem.\nUh, kind of why I'm here.\nAnd I've had founders call me, hey, I had one founder call me.\nMy family's in the car downstairs.\nI just puked in the shower.\nI'm shaking.\nI think this is the end.\nThey only got this many weeks of runway.\nAnd I said, great.\nLet's wrap up.\nCelebrate everything we learned.\nLet's find you a landing pad somewhere you can work or do an entrepreneur in residence and um let's write down everything we learned and then come up with another idea and join the accelerator and give you another 125k and do it again and do it again.\nAnd he was like, it's just money.\nYeah, exactly.\nAnd he was like, I feel so much better.\nWhat do I do now?\nI was like, go take your family to the park or lunch or the movies, whatever the hell you were going to go do.\nRight.\nRight.\nAnd just take the day off from your startup and we'll talk tomorrow.\nYou know, it's like live to fight another day.\nNone of this is that important.\nIf your and if your venture firm goes belly up and you know like our industry, you're one hit away from being a god.\nYes.\nLiterally, you hit one thing, you make some money.\nPeople in this industry think you're a genius.\nAfter I saw Web Log Inc., all of a sudden I was getting these keynote things after the Uber investment, Robin Hood investment.\nOh my god.\nAll in this weekend startups.\nEvery time I had some pop thing pop, boom, all of a sudden speaking exists.\nThose are the highs, right?\nBut those don't last.\nAnd they just had some golf guy on give this speech.\nDid you see this golf guy give this speech about how what's it I mean, I don't know what his name is, but this guy gave a great speech and he just talked about how ridiculous professional sports is because you work and you work and you work uh towards this goal.\nOnly one person wins the tournament.\nI don't know how many people play in a golf tournament, but it's got to be dozens and hundreds try to get in.\nAnd he said, like, listen, even when I win, I get like a momentary moment of like pleasure and joy.\nAnd then right after that, I'm back to the grind and it's all meaningless again.\nAnd Scotty Shuffler, I believe, is is the guy here.\nAnd if you have a chance, we'll put it in the show notes, but watch the clip.\nIt's five minutes.\nI'm not going to play the whole thing.\nPeople think they hear.\nBut I I'll just say it really does put into perspective what does matter and what doesn't.\nAnd this is a guy who's at the top of his He's sitting there at a press conference wearing a bright clean Nike hat on top of his game and world.\nAnd he says after the 2 minutes of a booleans, after the 2 minutes of joy, you have to figure out what to have for dinner.\nSo stay grounded, don't isolate, communicate, seek help, lean on people.\nAnd uh if you need 50 bucks, call me up.\nIf you need more than that, you call Jason.\nAnd uh yeah.\nWell, you know, the the the thing I'll leave you with is it's the journey, you know, like it's always been the journey.\nSo, just enjoy the ride.\nLike the ups, the downs, it's all part of it.\nAnd if you love doing the journey, which in the world of startup land is, you know, every day going in and trying to make that product a little better, trying to hire more people and talk to your customers.\nStartups are three things.\nI say this all the time on the show.\nIt's a team that builds a product that delights a customer, you know, and that's what you do all day and it's just a little loop.\nAnd if you enjoy that loop and you can find joy in it, do it.\nIf it's not joyful for you, find something that is.\nFounders, if you've got a product, maybe you've got some customers or even just a little bit of traction, guess what?\nYou've got yourself a startup and it's time to make things legit.\nYou want to be official.\nTighten it up.\nInvestors don't want to wire money to a Gmail account with a P.O.\nbox.\nNo, they want to know you're a serious person, and that your company is incorporated.\nIn 10 clicks and 10 minutes, you can follow your LLC, get an actual domain name, launch your official website, claim your business email, and even start fasttracking your trademark application.\nThat's right.\nYou need Northwest Registered Agent, the service that's going to do all of that for you.\nWith NWR's privacy by default option, they're going to use their address for all your public documents, not yours.\nSo, you're not going to get a ton of spam or junk mail.\nAnd you can also get a legit address and working phone number with their virtual office setup.\nSo, get more than just an LLC.\nGet your entire business identity.\nGo to northwestregisteredagent.com/twist and show the world you're in business.\nVenture capital is meeting with tons of founders, saying no to 99 or 199, saying yes to one.\nThen when you collect a hundred of those that are one in a hundred, one out of those hundred winds up keeping you in business and generating enough revenue because of the power law.\nSet another way, you know, it's like 10,000 meetings to get one Uber, 10,000 pitches to get one Robin Hood.\nThat's the nature of the game.\nOnce you realize that's the nature of a game, you're free.\nSo, when I was hanging out with these 10 startups from the Launch Accelerator, I just look at and go, \"Okay, one of these 10 is going to be outrageously successful, and if not in this class, it'll be in one of the next nine.\"\nAll right.\nUh, let's move on.\nJason, I want to talk about a record-breaking seed round.\nWe love to look at things in historical context here at TWiST.\nSo when Meera Marotti, the former OpenAI CTO, announced that her company, Thinking Machines Labs, has raised a $2 billion seed round led by Andre with money from Nvidia, AMD, Excel, Service Now, Cisco, and others at a 12 billion valuation.\nWe got to thinking, what's the biggest seed round of all time?\nAnd it turns out, drum roll please, it's this one.\nOkay, it's the biggest one ever.\nUh, other big ones, Safe Super Intelligence last year, billion plus.\nYuga Labs back in 2022.\nThe board's Yeah.\nBoard.\nYeah.\n450 million.\nLeela Sciences this year 200 evolutionary scale 140 last year.\nAnd then uh a company called O.XYZ, which I looked into.\nIt's uh it's crypto crypto blockchain AI thing.\nPut it all together maybe.\nUm, so these don't make a lot of sense when you look at them.\nUm, you know in the lens of it's a seed round, right?\nBecause that is a designation for essentially the earliest round of a startup or the second earliest.\nFriends and family would technically be the earliest but the first institutional money is often called preede or seed.\nPreede we came up with because the seed round started to get large so we just said oh it's a preede round.\nSo we keep coming up with these names in the industry.\nFriends and family.\nYour parents gave you 10 grand to incorporate.\nAnd then you asked your rich aunt for another 25k.\nSo you got 35k and friends and family.\nThen you did a preede round uh of 100k.\nSome angel for angel investors gave you 25k.\nThen you did a seed round with a seed fund launch.\nWell, we're really accelerator.\nSo we're kind of preede in this new nom.\nUm, and so pair parvc might be parc is a perfect example of a seed fund.\nThey'll put in 500k, a million, a million5, maybe even 3 million in a seed round.\nSeries A now has ballooned up to like a $10 million check.\nAnyway, Meera is the woman who famously made that funny face, which you can show on the screen, where they asked her like, \"Did you train OpenAI's video on uh YouTube?\" and she made this like smirk like hm how do I answer this which was clearly a yes in my mind my interpretation but she is part here's the image Jason just pull it up for everybody which is a meme yes this is a meme we to be clear we are not making fun of me's appearance we are enjoying the fact that she didn't have a good answer for the question that was obviously coming at the time yes somebody vain two white guys are making a judgment on a woman's appearance in b in business context.\nNo, it's just that she made like aquisitive smirk that became a meme.\nSo, if you give an over dramatic smirk to a journalist questions, it could get me'd.\nIt could get me.\nMale, female, non-binary, trans, whatever you are, it's going to get me'd.\nUm, but she uh is part of the now open AAI uh diaspora that if they start a company, people are going to value it at billions of dollars and rightfully so.\nThere was some secret sauce there.\nAll of those folks have gone on to start new companies and um there's so much capital in the world that it's an easy bet for somebody to put a couple hundred million into this if they've got a couple of billion dollars in their fund.\nSo it's not exactly a seed round, but um it is notable.\nIt is extremely notable.\nShe now has to build a product or service.\nSo what is the product product or service that she's going to build?\nOkay, so she actually did tell us a little bit about this.\nSo, Thinking Machine Labs is no longer just this amorphous thing that's happening, but we don't know.\nShe said in a post that her company is working on, and I quote, multimodal AI that works with how you naturally interact with the world through conversation, through site, through the messy way we collaborate.\nThat means very little.\nWhat matters actually is that they're going to put out a product in the next couple of months and there's going to be a quote significant open source component that will be useful for researchers and startups developing custom models.\nSo the capital has been raised and actual price point.\nWe have a timeline.\nWe have a bit of a promise.\nThis is getting more real.\nI just want to make a point though.\nWe've talked a lot about Meta's AI hiring spree.\nJason, we've talked about this on the show several times.\nAnd I was trying to sort out why you would ever give $2 billion to a company that hasn't launched anything which has has shown less than the average accelerator entrance.\nAnd then I realized it's just a talent buy.\nThis is just a a a partial aqua hire.\nShe has x number of researchers that Meta would pay $100 million a piece for.\nSo just give her the two billion for her 20 and then you're kind of doing the same transaction.\nSo it's almost like a adventure talent acquire in the form of a huge seed deal.\nI think you could look at that as the um the foundation of the investment.\nYeah.\nLike that is the backs stop of the investment.\nIf this product or idea doesn't work, we could get back some of our investment if the company sells because these people are so currently these people are so valuable.\nThis value is going to get reduced.\nSo the question I have is let's put a researcher on answering this question.\nWhat would it take in terms of the number of months and what skill what assignment would you give somebody if they're going to work six days a week 12 hours a day to become worth a hundred billion dollars or even I'm sorry $100 million or even $10 million to Zuckerberg in this great talent war?\nWhat because what do those people have in common?\nThey've done research papers.\nThey know how to do what?\nAnd somebody should be thinking how do I take really high aptitude people and turn them not into the $100 million version of this but you could aspire towards that but that has to do with supply and demand.\nThere are so many\n\n\nPeople out there who are full-stack engineers who don't command this number.\nSo what's the difference between a full-stack engineer and these AI researchers, and then what would it take to close the gap between those two?\nSomebody should start, I know this sounds crazy, but a professional development program to make you worth that amount.\nI wonder if Zuckerberg is also training people on how to become worth that, and then what is the raw intelligence firepower pedigree you need to have to be an AI researcher worth that amount?\nIs it just your track record, or you've built something specific?\nYou know, it's not like a programming language, you know, it's like you understand something very deep about the architecture of these systems.\nUh, Jason, we did a little bit more work on the GPU point for you, and I want to just talk about a couple of data points about that that you asked for.\nUm, we were trying to figure out with these depreciation schedules, what kind of money do you need to make back from your investment, from your capex to actually make this all pencil.\nSo, uh, Kabir and I from the investment team, um, did some work, and here's a couple of data points.\nSo, an H100 cost you about 25 or 30K MSRP.\nYou might get a discount if you spend a lot of money on them or spend a lot, buy a lot of them, volume, and so forth.\nBut what we did was we tried to figure out what their market value is.\nSo we went to Coreweave and we pulled their pricing for H100s, and then we applied a utilization rate, and then we figured out that you could essentially repay an H100 at expected usage rates in about 290 days.\nSo about less than a year.\nSo there is actually, if you're selling just inference to other companies on an hourly basis for rented GPUs, you can make your money back on a reasonable time frame.\nIt gets a little tricky to sort out exactly what kind of revenue is coming in.\nIf you're like XAI, you asked about Colossus, their 100,000 H100 data center.\nThat's about a $3 billion spend.\nIf you attach a four-year depreciation schedule, that's about $750 million a year in expected depreciation.\nAnd the thing about companies like XAI or OpenAI is they spend a lot of money on training, and that's not immediately monetizable.\nSo what you're doing is you're burning GPU time value and also, I would say, just like reliability and um, just retained worth to train a model before you use it.\nSo the economics here are a little bit hard to sort out.\nBut I'll just say that when you think about a four or five-year depreciation schedule against the data center spend, there is an expected enormous sum of revenue, not in 10 years, but like 2026, or a lot of the stuff doesn't pencil out because GPUs get improved on, they get obsolete, they fail, and they only last for so long.\nThe Vibe coding revolution is here.\nThe days of needing a team of developers to build your mobile app are over.\nWith Bolt new, anyone can build web applications quickly and without knowing how to code.\nGetting started is as easy as visiting bolt.new and then telling their AI-powered

behind.\nTry bolt.new for free at bolt.new/twist.\nThat's right, bolt.new/twist.\nSo, it's I'm still a Bolt.\nI'm a little bit...\nYeah.\nYou didn't put in here the value, the cost of running it on energy as well, right?\nSo, there's not inclusive of power or cooling.\nYeah.\nSo, there's a little power and cooling here, energy and maintaining it.\nBut just back of the envelope math, if you stand up a hundred thousand of these, you're probably going to make a billion dollars a year.\nAnd as you're saying, if you're making these models and then you're tossing them, what is an ongoing model make?\nWell, a billion dollars a year, if that's the bogey, that's the benchmark you got to hit to get to profitability at $240 a year.\nRight.\nSo, $240 a year into a billion dollars.\nIs that uh, 4 million subscribers?\nUh, it's 4.2 million.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo, 4.2 million subscribers to a product, just to give people some context.\nUm, a product like Netflix has a quarter billion, right?\nThey're up to 250.\nA product like Spotify might have like a hundred million paid subscribers, I think.\nUm, something like the New York Times might, I think they broke 10 million subscribers last year.\nSo, can Grock, Claude, etc., can they all just break, you know, uh, New York Times level of subscribers?\nI think the answer is yes.\nNow, that doesn't count the humans, etc.\nBut I do think you have to get to tens of millions at, you know, some point of people paying you $20 a month.\nAnd I think that's obtainable, let alone any like of those big um, co, those big $200 a month, $100 a month enterprise like subscriptions.\nAnd of course, you have people paying for uh, you know, API calls, developers hitting these servers with stuff.\nSo as big as it is, I think I just talked myself into obtainable, right?\nObtainable.\nYeah.\nAnd that's probably why they're, I don't know if they put 200,000 in, but I think Elon stated they're going to go to a million.\nSo going to a million, you know, and now you've got 10 billion a year in infrastructure costs or something like that.\nYeah.\nThese are big numbers, folks.\n10 billion, you know, now you're talking about having 40 million subscribers.\nOkay.\nNow you're talking about some of the largest subscription products ever created in the world.\nDoesn't mean it's not possible.\nIt just means you got to really build something that many people use, and and they are building something.\nThis is great research.\nWell done.\nYeah.\nAnd producer Claude says, actually, New York Times is doing even better than you thought, Jason.\nUh, 11.66 million subscribers as of the end of Q1, and OpenAI, according to again, producer Claude, had 3 million paying business users as of last data point.\nSo, it's all very interesting.\nI think this is super fun, and we also did some some data right now.\nNow, if you try to sell an H100 that you've used, you can almost get all your money back.\nBut I bet you once uh Blackwell availability gets a little bit easier to get your hands on, they'll lose value.\nBut there's a lot of money going in.\nIt's a lot of fun.\nAnd Anthropic uh got Amazon to do all their infra work for them.\nSo, I think Anthropic is the asset-light foundation AI model company.\nSo, we'll see how that plays out.\nPerplexity, right?\nI've been using this Perplexity comment browser, and it um, I have it set to Claude, and Claude uh, I guess they they abstracted themselves from the back end, I guess, to protect themselves from OpenAI originally, if you remember that story.\nOpenAI was like, we're going to launch a search engine, and they never did, or they, I don't...\nYeah, I haven't heard any hey about it, so...\nUm, did they ever open a launch a search engine?\nThere's a search button inside of, but they talking about like, I maybe what Sam realized was just incorporating going out to the web and scraping a couple of pages in real time is what search is anyway, but there was this talk that you would go to OpenAI and do a search and get something back that would look more like a Perplexity.\nOh, I see.\nNeighbor down comprehensive search.\nAnyway, uh, let's keep moving.\nAll right, uh, we saw the transcript from Mark Zuckerberg's recent chat with The Information, and he had a very interesting quote about how AI might be getting ready to self-improve, Jason.\nI think this is worth a moment of our time.\nIt caught both of our eyes.\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and read this for everybody because I do think this could be the start of an important turning point.\nSo, The Information asks them, hey, you know, why are you doing all this hiring?\nAnd Mark says, yeah, it's been busy.\nYou know, I think the most exciting thing this year is that we're starting to see early glimpses of self-improvement with the models, which means that developing super intelligence is now in sight.\nThat is an enormous, almost throwaway claim from the Meta CEO because it implies, Jason, that soon we won't just be depending on these smart humans we were discussing to make the models.\nThere could be some ability for models to actually make themselves better.\nNow we don't know if that'll be a quick process, a slow process, expensive or cheap, but just the fact that we're touching that now gives me quite a lot of optimism that we'll see Grock 4 level improvements across benchmarks over the next couple of models in the next couple of years.\nSo I would say bullish for startups that build using AI just frameworks.\nI think this is overall bullish for everyone in the tech game.\nYeah.\nSo people were talking about artificial general intelligence, AGI, and super intelligence.\nThese are like kind of two slightly different terms.\nSuper intelligence just means, I think, smarter than any human in any human domain.\nWhereas artificial general intelligence means you've kind of replicated the human brain, like replicating consciousness, I would think, is how many people would look at that.\nUm, and so are, is this, are we now in the super intelligence business, uh, with Grock's latest release, you know, scoring perfect on every SAT?\nYes.\nBut where's the common sense?\nAnd I think that's the general intelligence part of this.\nIf it was, if these systems were truly intelligent, just to use, take out the super and artificial in general, if they were just in actually intelligent, we wouldn't have this issue of it making mistakes or making stuff up.\nIf you do, if you, you can ask it prompts and have it return gibberish.\nYou can return wrong answers.\nSo, you know, we're still far off with this modality with the, you know, this tokens and uh, um, you know, the the current language model architecture where it's guessing the next best word, and we're doing all these prompts to try to sort of think this is intelligence.\nWell, is it?\nUh, is the big question.\nAnd if it was, well, it would know how to improve itself already.\nSo, I think it's pockets, verticals of intelligence that are emerging, but I think we're probably more than two or three years.\nI usually might be more like 5 to 10.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nI'll take that.\nBut I mean, you know, we humans call hallucinations lying.\nYeah.\nSo, I mean, it's not like we don't...\nWell, I, I, the way that I think about this is like if I invented a source on a paper, right, and submitted to my professor and said, \"Yeah, I cited this court case and doesn't actually exist.\"\nThat's not a an oopsie.\nThat's a deliberate fabrication, which is a lie.\nSo, we're working on that.\nUh, I'm really excited though, Jason, about the companies that are trying to melt neurons with uh, digital systems.\nThere's a company called Cortical Labs that I'm obsessed with, and they've uh, found a way to manufacture neurons and actually connect them to silicon chips using a cool little interface thing.\nSo, we're going to have um, organic digital computers that are going to do a lot of cool stuff.\nSo, quite a lot to get excited about.\nIt's coming, and I think I think it's going to keep going faster, which is going to be just an absolute treat.\nAll right.\nUh, let's talk about Brian Singerman's new Meta Venture capital fund.\nJason, this is something that again you and I both had our eyes on.\nNow, if you don't know Brian Singerman, uh, he was at Founders Fund from 2008 through, I think, 2024, at which point he became a founder, sorry, a partner emeritus.\nAnd he was at Google, by the way, from 04 to 08 this millennium.\nUm, he was going to leave to go off and do some work-life balance.\nDoesn't seem to have stuck that much because he's working with Lee Lyndon of Quiet Capital to put together a new fund that TechCrunch says is called GPX.\nAnd Jason, this is not a traditional venture capital fund.\nIt has an interesting strategy of putting some of its capital into emerging managers and then holding on some of its capital to help those emerging managers defend their ownership percentage as their breakout companies uh, raise later rounds.\nMaybe you could frame this for us in like Launch Accelerator terms, like how would this work if we were doing that here?\nUm, pretty straightforward, and Brian Singerman's been on the pod, I think, twice.\nUh, we can ask producer Claude what the episode numbers are, and looks like uh, oh, actually, I just did it.\nProducer Claude says episode 748, July 2017, and episode 1896, February 2024.\nSo he's been on twice in the last decade.\nReally smart cat.\nUh, and I think the idea here is he will put money into small funds.\nThose small funds then don't have the ability in some cases to take their pro rata and maintain their percentage ownership in later funding rounds, but he'll come in and give the ability to do that and then share economics, obviously.\nSo this concept has been done, not in one structure typically, but you will have somebody like Mark Andreessen or Sequoia's partners or other venture capitalists put small amounts of money into emerging fund managers.\nSo I have put 25, 50, 100k into a couple of different seed funds, first-time funds, with the idea that they would send us companies we would then be able to invest in those companies.\nIt hasn't exactly worked out that way because our deal flow is greater than the people we've given that money to.\nUh, but here there'll be some contractual language that when those companies break out, Brian gets first shot at that, you know, pro rata, I believe, because you, you would need some contractual language there.\nAnd um, yeah, great idea for a fund.\nAnd we were talking earlier about how high pressure it is.\nHow most of these seed funds don't make it.\nSo GPX, general partner X, the idea is he's a fund of funds that then makes direct in co-investments with them.\nAnd uh, that's a smart idea.\nI think he'll have great success with it.\nHe really pioneered this going all-in strategy in whatever their biggest name was.\nSo the big wins at Founders Fund were uh, companies like SpaceX and Andrew.\nUm, there was one other, maybe it was Airbnb.\nThey kind of hit those early and then just keep plowing money into them.\nAnd some of the funds have like 15 or 25% of a fund, an individual fund in one name.\nSo that kind of conviction betting is a smart idea.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWell, if you have a breakout company, keep doubling down.\nWhat's the old Buffett quote?\nLike uh, nip your losses...\n\n\nin the butt and let your winners run or something along those lines. Let your winners ride is in the all-in theme song. I don't know who gets credit for that one.\n\nWell, someone dropped a comment somewhere. We'll take a look at that. Uh, this contrast though, Jason, with news from the NVCA's PitchBook report they just dropped about Q2, which shows that, uh, through the second quarter of this year, uh, VCs here in the States only raised 26.6 billion and, uh, last year, for example, in a full year, it was about 81. Year before 98, and then 2022 was the insane nearly $200 billion inflow year. Uh, I'm trying to sort out the the tea leaves here. Is Venture, as you mentioned, coming out of its uh liquidity crisis? We're seeing this fund put together. Is it getting better out there for VCs who are looking to raise capital to invest?\n\nI haven't raised a fund since after Silicon Valley Bank went bust. Uh, can you can you get out there? Come on. We need some on-the-ground reporting.\n\nI mean, yeah, I have one more year with this fund. So I think maybe the second half of 2026 I would go out and raise fund five. If I raise a fund five, you don't have to make that decision. Every time as a fund manager, you're resetting a 10-year clock, 12-year clock of your commitment. I'm 54, so I have to think, okay, when I'm 55, do I want to reset the clock to 65 years old, right? So, this is where succession planning, etc. But this is kind of the peak of a venture capitalist career. 40s, 50s, you know, into your early 60s, you got enough knowledge, you got a big network, you really know how to, you know, sort of understand the game. This is like peak years. It's almost like being 25 to maybe it's like 26 to 32 in your NBA terms would be the the years I'm in right now. Or just do syndicate investments or use my own money to invest in companies and not have LPs. So, you get a lot of different optionality that opens up to you. Um, and when I go out, you know, I think next year would be perhaps the perfect time to go out and raise a fund. This year is the transition year. People are just starting to see DPI. If Canva, if Adobe, I'm sorry, if Canva and Figma both have, and interestingly, they're both in a similar space, graphic design. If those two come out and Stripe or SpaceX eventually, if those four companies, any two of those companies get out the door, it's going to rain so much, uh, so many distributions on the industry, I think people will feel pretty good about it again and want to be in venture far firms. They're already starting to feel that way because of CoreWeave, Circle, and other things that have had a great outing. So yeah, the industry goes through these, you know, pendulum swings and it feels like we're climbing up again and, uh, it really just has to do with, uh, the singles and doubles of exits and IPOs. So yeah, I'm I'm absolutely\n\nwhen it hits when the revenue lands from it becomes the big question. So if we were to look at something like self-driving, uh, these companies are just starting to get those cars on the road and they're deep in the J curve. Like in order for those cars to be profitable is going to take a lot. It's gonna take a lot of time for, you know, a $100,000 Whimo or a $50,000 Tesla. How many rides does it have to do? What is the price? How much has been invested in that already? You know, Whimo's probably raised, I wonder if Whimo's $15 billion in, $20 billion in. And then I wonder if the rides are even profitable now given the cost of the car and the number of engineers and people who are monitoring those cars. Making it profitable is the next piece of the puzzle. They have to make it profitable versus existing humans in cars that have already been paid for. So you're just paying the maintenance on those cars. So it's a lot of work to be done for it to hit the bottom line.\n\nI totally agree. But we are seeing some progress there. Tesla. I I I saw news that they raised the price of their uh self-driving rides in Austin.\n\nYeah. $6.9.\n\nYeah. So, I don't there's not a funnier meme number up to go. So, I don't think they'll change prices again, but that does show some uh upper mobility there. And also, people keep saying that Whimos costs more than Ubers's. So, I do think that they're kind of like staking out almost a higher price point, which could help with some of the economics there. But, yes, very much deep in the J curve.\n\nUh, for fun though, Jason, Firefly Aerospace, which is going public right now. Uh, I I wrote about them this morning for my little newsletter. They have a funny item. It's like, uh, they say in their S1, basically the more rockets we send up, the better our economics get. And I'm like, okay, I know that, but it's good that you said it. Scale does help everything. Uh, and these companies, I think, will end up being very much in the black.\n\nBy the way, let your winners ride is a Peter Lynch, uh, the famous fund manager. He said, uh, selling your winners and holding your loss losers, referring to stocks, is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds. He strongly advocated letting the big winners compound, which thematically is the same as let your winners ride. Um, yeah. So, produce your clock.\n\nWhat Warren Buffett said was, um, my favorite holding period is forever.\n\nSo, pretty good one. Yeah, those are all in the same zone. It's amazing like all these colloquialisms and nuggets. What I like to do with Claude is I'll put those in there and say, \"Give me ones adjacent to this idea.\" And just like we did that between the two of us, now you put those two in and say, \"Are there other ideas like this?\" Then I'll put in, \"Has this been the theme of a song, a poem, a book or an essay, a newspaper, a magazine story, a movie, or like a scene in a movie. It's very interesting how you can kind of go down the rabbit hole and take an idiom and just find all the different uses of it because somebody wrote about that on their blog 10 years ago and made that connection for you.\n\nI I love learning from our our elders, if you will. I I read some Warren Buffet biographies back in the day. Guys, just straight awesome.\n\nYeah.\n\nUh, okay, let's keep it going here. I want to get to a couple of Reddit rapid responses, Jason. But first, I want to talk about startup culture because there's been some really interesting, uh, almost like gonzo reporting to discuss here. So, uh, there was a guy named Calvin French-Owen. He was previously one of the founders of Segment, which as I'm sure everyone recalls, sold to Twilio for several billion dollars. He ended up going to work for OpenAI for just over a year. He joined the technical staff and helped to work on the launch of OpenAI CodeEx, which is their, I believe, command line interface, uh, agenta coding tool. Anyways, he shared some notes on the company and how Open AI actually operates. And we talk a lot about startups here and the need for velocity. Well, as it turns out, that's kind of how Open AI works. Um, he says, quote, \"There's a strong bias to action. You can just do things. It wasn't unusual for similar teams, but similar but unrelated teams to converge on various ideas.\" Also says, \"Open AI changes direction on a dime.\" And so as he discusses this company, it really does feel like a firm that has scaled up in human terms but has managed to retain a research-driven engineering nimble uh posture to its market which struck me as a real feat because most companies in my experience become big companies in small suits pretty quickly with layers of management and you know tiered meetings and all of that. Open AI still seems a little bit punk rock and I was just kind of blown away by that. So I'm curious Jason for founders out there, uh, what's your advice for fostering a collaborative but fast-moving culture and then defending that as you grow?\n\nYeah, so there are people who've worked in companies who will ask for permission, will want to know like resource planning, etc. And in startups what you want to do is just build stuff and you know you want to do it in a coordinated fashion, of course, but in a hypergrowth one like this sometimes they will carve out time and say you know if you think you've got a great idea just build it and show it to us or whatever and Google actually incorporated that into their culture with 20% time something they don't talk about anymore. Uh, Facebook had move fast and break things. Netflix had freedom plus responsibility. Uber had be super pumped, uh, be stoked basically, um, grit, you know, high energy. DAR changed Ubers to, uh, have responsibility, uh, and focused on that when they changed their culture, uh, to one of responsibility and think about what's our responsibility as an actor in this space as opposed to be super pumped and be driven. Uh, you can go down the line, SpaceX has simplified, remove parts and think from first principles. All these philosophies can work. Philosophy is another way to say culture. What doesn't work is not having a culture and not defining it because if you don't define it in your company, it will be defined for you. And so, for example, I was explaining to two different people in our firm, two different pieces of culture I like to have. One is please don't complain ever about being overworked. If you have a lot on your plate and you feel overwhelmed, sure, you can say, \"Here's everything I'm working on. What's my what do you think should be my priority?\" But don't be like, \"Oh my god, I'm so busy.\" That's like the loser stance. Like they're like, \"Oh my god, I'm overwhelmed.\" No. Say, \"By the way, I'm working on five things. The this is the priority I've given them. What do you think the priority should be?\" And then you go to your manager, you go to your co-workers, and you say, \"Oh, yeah. By the way, that thing is no longer relevant. Let's just stop doing that completely. That one should be automated and that one you should delegate. So that leaves these two. That's actually the culture I like to have, which is never complain. Oh my god. Like, oh, I'm overwhelmed and you're asking me to do too much. That's like um a union kind of representative like uh it's not my job. All that kind of stuff. No, it should be here's what I'm working on. What's the priority here? Right. Then the next piece I think is always presenting full information, uh, as transparently as possible and anticipating the next two or three questions. So when I train people I'm like present the full case. So many times people are like um we have a founder who asked about X and I'm like okay the next three questions are obviously okay would we invest in the next round? The obviously next three questions is do you have a term sheet yes or no. Uh, do you want us to lead the round? Is this a bridge round? What's the revenue for the past 18 months by week? Um, and what's the valuation that you're raising it? Like there's a whole series of questions. So, I'll have somebody new work here. Be like, uh, this founder wants to know if we'll invest in the next round. It's like, okay, that's without information. That's a magic eightball question. Yeah.\n\nYeah. It's just silly. And so now it's like okay before you bring it to the team and then it's my job as the leader to say here's the situations where we would invest. So I've defined that culture ahead of time. We don't do bridge rounds. We invest, we will sometimes take our pro rata in breakout deals. So that typically is 3x. So if it's a bridge round the answer is no. We don't do bridge rounds. If you're doing a price round and another venture capitalist is joining the board, those are the rounds we participate in when we have a pro rata decision. If you're doing bridge rounds, that's not for us, but we can introduce you to folks. We'd like to know about that. We'd like to use that opportunity when you're raising a bridge round to get information, but nine times out of 10, we're not going to do a bridge round. We our reserve capital is reserved for breakout companies, top 5% of the portfolio. And so we don't have to have that repetitive conversation. So in terms of OpenAI, they said or Sam Walman said at some point, if you think there's a really good idea, just build it and then show it to us and if you want to push it to production, like just go for it and you you won't get in trouble for doing that. He defined in their culture to do that. Now that means they could have embarrassing things happen. So you have to have a back stop and the back stop is the red team making sure that you know that would be the friction you would add. Okay. Yeah. If you get there first and you want to launch something that I saw, uh, you know, some language model had ingested all the SEC documents and you could ask questions against the SEC documents. If you wanted to launch that product, great. Um, and if two people were competing to do it and index it, okay, it's not efficient, but who made the better product, right? Right. And so, wins.\n\nYeah. And this wouldn't fly in a place like Apple. Apple's philosophy is we want to have the most polished product. And that's why Apple is so far behind on AI because everybody's releasing stuff and they're like, it doesn't matter if this works or not. It does not matter if it gives you the wrong answer. It doesn't matter if we stole the content from the New York Times and didn't get permission is the wild west is how this thing is is shaping up. That is the antithesis of everything Apple does. Apple will be if they do participate in this be some sort of a darkhorse candidate. Like they will come from behind and say, \"Oh, by the way, we've been working on a language model. Here it is. Boom.\" And not even tell anybody. Like they were working on the headset and not telling anybody. and they just dropped it, right?\n\nYeah. So, they dropped it and it made a gigantic thud as it smashed into the ground. I don't think Apple's going to manage to beat the AI companies because just going back to this guy's\n\n\nMemo on Open AI. Uh, he says, quote, \"Open AI is perhaps the most frighteningly ambitious I've ever seen.\" And then he also said, \"The codeex sprint to launch was probably the hardest I've worked in nearly a decade. Most nights were up until 11 or midnight. It reminded me of being back at YC. If you take capital and progress and brand and work ethic and flexibility and a research-like culture and hard work, what can stop you other than bad luck? That is a winning freaking equation.\nIt's um... Yeah, but I, you know, when I stopped by XAI on a Saturday to see Elon and the progress they were making, they were all there on a Saturday, too. So, it seems like everybody's, you know, burning the midnight oil on this specific um goal, you know, reaching super intelligence. Okay.\nWhat a perfect segue to our Polymarket of the day, Jason. We have picked this one out for enjoyment because it involves some of your favorite companies and also your favorite person. We get to talk about you, Jason. We get to talk about Mr. Calakanis.\nYes, you are. Cuz we're going to ask who is going to be the next CEO of X.\nAnd if you...\nDon't do it. I'm not on that list.\nUh, you were when we prepared this segment. Let's scroll on down. There's David Saxs. There's Jack Dorsey. Jason Calakanis.\nYeah. Put a dot, but put a period before that.\nUh, hilar.\nNo, that would be Gwen Shotwell or Robin Denhel. You're actually third from the bottom here.\nOkay. Um, but Mr. Beast has 5%. And so I don't think you're that high in the running, but this is such a fun data set because, you know, Linda Yaccarino is out as we discussed, and uh, people are currently betting the the leading result is that there won't be a CEO this year. Second best is Elon. The right answer is no CEO because X is now X.com, formerly Twitter, is now part of XAI. Why do you need a CEO of it? You just need a GM. You need the general manager, a product lead, etc.\nAnd you know, Elon's vision for what is now X.com, formerly Twitter, is exactly the opposite of what I would have pursued if I had bought the company. Uh, and you can be sure we've had conversations about it. Uh, never really actually talked about it publicly before, but I'll tell you what my vision for Twitter was post Takeover.\nUm, was to make it an entertainment company and to use the subscription model and Twitter's reach to create verticals.\nAllah, I did at Ingadget or Inside or other content products I've done and had some expertise in. So my idea was do Twitter comedy, do Twitter music, do Twitter EDM, even Twitter poetry, whatever. Pick a category. That's really great. And comedy is a great idea. So you do Twitter comedy and you do a Twitter comedy tour and you would have a 10 city tour. You would get those comedians to talk about it on Twitter. You would release the clips and you'd have the live stream only available on Twitter. So for your 10, 15 bucks a month like Netflix, you'd have this amazing Twitter comedy content. Then you could go to people like Dave Chappelle or whoever uh was coming up, Shane Gillis, whatever, and compete with Netflix.\nYeah.\nTo get them to do their comedy special on Twitter or at least to come on the tour. And maybe don't compete with Netflix heads up on Chappelle. But maybe you get the next Chappelle. And maybe you own in perpetuity, you know, this library of, you know, uh, those uh, great emerging comedians. Then you do the Twitter uh music festival and you compete with, you know, Coachella, etc. Uh, you just have this incredible stage somewhere in Austin or New York and you have all that music available and then imagine if eventually you got to 365 days of programming so that anytime you open Twitter something live was happening that night that people could talk about and participate in. And then you advertised so you have the subscription revenue and the ad revenue. When you go sell ads, you say to Disney, \"Hey, you've got or you know, you say to Warner Brothers, hey, you've got Superman coming out. We'll do a whole leadup to Superman over these hundred days with clips.\" And you're basically got the social component with the video component. And that was sort of my vision for it. But that was not his vision. His vision was freedom of speech and to feed into this grand uh language model. Both visions would work. I think his vision candidly is more important for society and bigger. Mine would have been a more delightful subscription content.\nYours would... Yours would have been lots of fun, especially for the CEO cuz then you get to hobnob with all the comedians.\nI was thinking that too. Yeah, sure. Why not? But I was never in the running for or lobbying for the CEO job. I like sent one joke tweet to Elon, one joke message to Elon like, \"Oh my god, my favorite job in the world would be CEO of Twitter. Put me in the game.\" Uh, and it was I was obviously joking. I I saw that one. But no, I'm not trying to say that you're going to be the next CEO. I we just found it very whimsical when we're going through all the marketing one. I was like, well, Jason will hate this show. You think of a more challenging job than being the CEO of Twitter of X? I mean, oh my god, it's like people are so full contact on there. It's, you know, when if you have a freedom of speech platform that is going to be that freedom of speech where people can really go for it, you know, Kanye West can go on an episode and say all kinds of crazy stuff. Like, I'm glad it's there, but that means you have to come to work and deal with that, you know, and every day there's a different Kanye West.\nLet's get to some founder questions.\nOkay. We found we found one on the entrepreneur subreddit that we really wanted to put up against you. We kind of went back and forth as a group and we thought this was very apppropo. So our dear friend final26355 over there on the subreddit asks, \"How do you feel about founders utilizing AI?\" Quote, \"I've used AI to help with pitch decks, models, investor emails, etc. I'm curious, how do investors feel about this? Do you think it's lazy or is it just a smart way to save time and be efficient with new technology?\" Jason, you are an investor, so talk to me.\nIf you weren't using the latest tools to learn about the total addressable market, to design your product, to write a press release, to write a job description, you're not investable. So, nobody is looking at this saying like, oh, you have to go pick the vegetables and forage for mushrooms in the foothills of Napa in order to bring the mushrooms back to, you know, the uh, the restaurant. and we're doing a Michelin starred restaurant. So, you have to like to be at the French Laundry or NMA, you know, like that's not the idea here. Like, if you can get the mushrooms delivered to you and somebody else does the work and you can work on whatever the other thing is, great. So, there's no shame in the AI game. Get in there, go crazy, and, you know, move fast. All this stuff is performative anyway. us talking to you talking to a VC is a performative exercise. You're saying, \"Hey, here's my grand vision. You're trying to convince them to write a check.\" All they're doing is looking at what's the market size, how good is your team, and what's your product velocity. So, what you think they're indexing on is probably not what they're indexing on. They're going to look at you and say, \"Okay, you've never done anything. You're completely unknown as founders.\nOkay, so I can't look at your track record. You're not, you know, uh, Elon starting a new company or Travis starting cloud kitchens after Uber.\nOkay, so we can't look at track record. Great. Any other pedigree here? You went to MIT. You wrote some paper on computer vision. Okay, we don't have that either. You're just complete unknown. Okay, what did you make? And it's like, I didn't make anything. It's like, okay, go make something. Come back. Then they're going to look at your product. They're going to look at the product. You have any customers? No customers? Great. come back to when you have customers or they're going to look at your product and say, \"That's really interesting. What a great demo. We'll give you some seed funding or you should go to an accelerator.\" Then you get some customers and say, \"Great. I'm going to talk to the customers. I'm going to look at your product, look at the product velocity. How often is it changing?\" And you're unknown and then maybe I'll take a bet if I think that you are going to, you know, change the world. But they're going to look at what you built. So that's it. Like all this other stuff, the model you make, that's great. You know, we can have an interesting discussion about it. Um, your deck, okay, it's good-looking, great. You know how to make a good-looking deck, like checkbox, you're not a complete idiot. But what really matters is that zero to one when you get a customer and your product velocity. Focus on those two things and building a great team. And if you're unknown, you're an unknown person who recruits two people from Airbnb who worked in, I don't know, one of them is a developer, one of them was in growth, and you're like, \"Yeah, I got these two folks out of Airbnb. They kick ass and we've got product velocity. Now that's impressive. You did something. You got two co-founders. You convinced them to leave Airbnb and to start the company with you. So, it's a great question. No VC is going to be like, \"Oh my god, you you wrote your total addressable market slide based on chat GBT.\" Now, if you didn't check your facts and it was wrong, it might look stupid, but all right, great episode everybody. Uh, we will see you on Friday. We will.\nUh, and he is x.com.\nI have not lived in the cigar yet. I am x.com/jason. The docket. You can read it now. You can contribute to it. This Week in Startups.com/docket and you'll see the last docket, the current docket. You can add comments to it. It's a great way for you to participate in the show. And we'll see you. Thanks to Poly Market and producer Claude for helping out today. Great.\nYes, very much so.\nI am not taking that job. If Elon came to me and said, \"I need you to do me a favor. Take this job for 6 months.\" I I mean, maybe as a friend, I would be like, \"Sure, I'll jump into the absolute mosh pit for you.\" But there would be the worst job I can imagine is the heartbeat. One heartbeat.\nWorst job in than running a social network that nobody's ever happy. Nobody, even even a one that's the most scrubbed, Instagram, etc. All you deal with is people who are lunatics.\nJason, if you did that job for 6 months and you had no life before, you would have a lifetime of stories just from... I would do it for... I I do it for free for the... do it for the story. I have too much for the laws. We'll see you all next time. Byebye.\n",
