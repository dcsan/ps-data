With me again, Alex Wilhelm. Alex, what do we got in the docket today? Give me the top three stories and then we'll get into it. What do you think the top three stories are today? Top three stories. is I'm going to have to say Chime's IPO and the results from it. That to me is just such a milestone event for the technology scene. I'm going to say the combination of Stripe, Shopify, Amazon, and Walmart advancing their stable coin initiatives. And on the startup front, Jason, I went through the YC batch and I pulled out some themes and some notes for us just in case we want to do a little bit of a dive into uh the upcoming uh new generation. Okay, YC class number 723. My god, been around forever. Congratulations to the team at YC. They do a great job. Okay. Uh so hit us up. What's the first story? All right. So we're talking about Chime's IPO. Now, everyone, I'm sure knows, but I'll remind you Chime is an American neo bank. That means it's a software company or a software layer on top of traditional banking services. Popular amongst consumers, mobile first, youth-friendly, popular around the world. Chime Jason went uh up to a $26 billion valuation during the Zerp era, the kind of 2022 era moment in time and went public at about 11.7 billion. It priced at $27 a share above its range, positive, and then had an absolutely great first day. Ended up closing at 37.11 per share, up 37%. Not a crazy pop. Nothing that's going to get Bill Gurley too mad, but a very solid first day result for yet another 2025 decacorn IPO. All right. So, Chime is a neo bank. A neo bank provides services like checking, banking, but it does it in a modern fashion so that it's easy to set up an account, easy to get into your checking, it's easy to move money around, move money around, and they tend to have a much better deal on fees. The playbook for startups is what services do you hate? Who's got the worst customer service? And if you think who's got the worst customer service, a bank. Mhm. Anything that's monopolistic, like if you only have cable in your neighborhood before Starlink existed or 5G, you know, you can order 5G for your house, I think, now in some markets. So, whenever you have one person who's got a monopoly, they tend to let their customer support go down. They take their customers for granted. That's what happens in socialism and uh communism. You have like one bread. Take it or leave it. And if you don't like the Brad, you don't really get to write a Yelp review. So you don't have to fight. You don't have competition like in capitalism. So one of the great playbooks in a capitalistic society is try to find something people hate and try to make something better. People hated New York City cabs. They had a long list of reasons of why a New York City cab sucked. They typically were dirty. They didn't smell good. drivers drove like lunatics because they were trying to make a ton of money and they were under the gun because they have to pay $125 at the beginning of the shift to rent the car. So they're basically for the first 8 hours negative. They literally are losing money for 8 hours. Then uh we have the next stage of this which is uh you know you couldn't get one and they were unpredictable. So, uh, what you would do is you, uh, look for one of these. And I think New Bank, Chime, and all these great companies looked and found these. And so, congratulations to them. Uh, and there's crypto exchanges who did this, but crypto was a new space. Robin Hood did this, too. Yeah. Uh, trading on Erade or Ameritrade or some of those old clunky services that were expensive and slow. Expensive, slow, bad customer support equals new opportunity available. Absolutely. Sometimes though it's it's hard to go after these spaces. It's not easy to get into the banking world chasing with regulation and you know incumbents and I would presume just institutional dislike of change. But that's also where sometimes you can make the most money. I mean Uber had to take on governments, local governments, state governments, entranced interests, taxi drivers. Like they had a a myriad number of people who wanted them to fail. But the prize was big enough to keep going after it. And in the case of Chime, a lot of folks made a lot of money. um people that owned more than 5% of Chime at its IPO. DST Global, Cross Link, uh General Atlantic, Menllo Ventures, Cath Innovation, a lot of people are eating off this deal. So, I'm going to ask you the same question I do every time. How much will this liquidity help the drought that you and I have been talking about for what feels like 10 years now? Yeah, I mean it's obviously super helpful when you know DST which is Yuri Milner's firm I believe uh you know and that's his money I think primarily I don't think he's got other LPs now but for the other folks who were in this they might have been sitting on Chime I'm not sure when Chime was founded but this is a 10 plus year old company I believe uh you can check that and you know this is a long wait they might have had opportunities to sell in secondary as we talked about during our venture round table on Wednesday which went really well people seem to like that um you know this is great for the industry and um looking back we had um a circle IPO that went 4x we had a coreweave IPO that went 3x and now we have chimes IPO and what was the pop 50% 60% it closed 37% it opened up 59 just under 60 but closed today up 37 but still a very strong result those are three in five weeks do we should every time we Um, I wanted to have like an IPO tracker here. So, at the end of the notes, let's always have the last, you know, a running total. We can copy and paste it in the docket. For those of you who want to follow the docket and really get smart and and really understand the industry well, go to this week in startups.com/doccket. Alex does a great job. So, in the IPO tracker here, when was uh coreweave? What date? And then the one before that one after that was Coreweave was March 28th, 2025. And then we had E Toro which was May 14th and then we had Circle which was June 5th and now here on June 13th. So about a three-month run for a number of successful mostly fintech IPOs. Got it. Well, so there's this is why we make a list Alex is because we trends. So Stablecoin Mhm. stock trading app, new bank, and then uh an AI hosting company, Cororeweed. Stands out a little bit of the last is AI is going to be the next wave. I predict we're going to see a series of AI IPOs in the next year. Um maybe Grock, maybe Open AI if they can clean up their uh issues. I think you could see a whole flurry of IPOs. Just to be clear though, you mean Grock GR O Q, not Grock, the AI chatbot that we use over on X, correct? Uh, Grock, the infringe chip backed by Chimath, my friend Sandep Maj, your friend of the pod. He's working on there. His company was acquired by them. I could see them going public. I don't have any inside information, but you know, if you get towards a half a billion dollars in revenue, a billion dollars in revenue, and we're seeing this. So once again, um we we this is not a political podcast obviously, but when you're trying to assess what's happening, it's very easy to get emotional and talk about, you know, oh, this person's, you know, out of it and Biden's uh, you know, weekend at Bernie's or Trump is anti- big tech. Put aside all the noise you hear on MSNBC and Fox. Irrelevant. Look at the data on the field. That's what I like to do. The data speaks. got four IPOs in four months that are significant. We also have I think we're up to about 10 M&A transactions and uh we'll we'll go through those again, but we we can even do them off the top of our head because we cover this so deeply. Two for Door Dash, two for Open AI. I think there's maybe three for Uber this year, you know, really tiny tuckins. Uh and then one for Salesforce. That was uh yeah, that was the Moon the Moon company. But actually, this is a a great segue, Jason, because uh we've been tracking stable coins quite a lot, and we just found out this week that Stripe is buying a company called Privy, which comes after its purchase of Bridge. Bridge was their stable coin investment, and Privy is a crypto wallet startup last valued at 230 million. Now, we don't know how much they paid for it, probably less than that if I'm being honest. But yet another deal that is a tuck in acquisition now this one in the fintech space but I think it just goes to show that the momentum in M&A that we're seeing is persisting and across a pretty good cohort of companies founders let's be real finding the right developers is timeconuming it's arduous it's painful you hear the tone of my voice and you're trying to scale your startup well my friends at lemon.io IO can save you time. They're going to save you money and they're going to get rid of the headache that you have right now, which is finding great developers. They've done all the leg work and they have prevetted developers and they're ready to help you ship product. They're experienced. They're resultsoriented. Lemon.io isn't just finding you great developers, but they're helping integrate them into your team. They're skimming the cream. They're only offering handpicked developers with at least 3 years of experience. This is the 1% of the 1%. This is the deme. And if something goes wrong, lemon.io will find you a replacement developer ASAP. That's the time frame I like. Twist listeners get 15% off their first four weeks. I think that's a month. 15% off the first month. Pretty good deal. Totally unnecessary. You guys have great prices anyway, but uh hey, we appreciate it. So, stop burning money. Hire developer smarter. Visit lemon.io/twist. I I do want to point out though that it does feel like Stripe and Data Bricks and some other these like quas public private companies, you know, the the private companies that tell us their their numbers and they basically act like public companies, they're getting pretty acquisitive and I think that's really healthy for the technology scene, but it probably does complicate liquidity a bit because if you invest in a company and you know, Stripe buys it, I guess you might get cash for, but if you get Stripe stock, you might still be kind of locked up. So, I'm not sure if all these acquisitions are as liquidity inducing as, you know, Google buying you or whatever, but still super positive to see that amount of, you know, shares trading hands. Okay, great. What else is in the news? All right, so sticking to the stable coin theme, a couple things we just talked about how Stripe is buying Privy. Uh, other news items from the world of stables this week include that Shopify is now going to support merchant transactions using the USDC stablecoin from Circle on the Base blockchain, which is Coinbase. So, we're seeing those companies work together to increase the availability and usability of stable coins. And then news today is that Walmart and Amazon, and then quoting the journal here, and other multinational giants have recently explored whether to issue their own stable coins in the US. So, we could see a dramatic expansion in the number of stable coins in the market. And it seems in response to that, Jason, Visa, Mastercard both lost about four or 5%. Because they might be essentially circumvented in some cases. Now, both Walmart and Amazon have more than $150 billion in quarterly revenue. So, we're talking about in theory a lot of money movement that could be swapped over to stable coins. And that I think really opens up a lot of opportunities for startups because there's probably a lot of tooling to be built in and around the stable coin space. And I don't think that the couple of stable coin starts we have in the twist 500 uh one money and stably are all the companies that are going to do well here. But I think our thesis about stable coins is really coming good. All right. So, uh, Stripe bought bridge. We remember that stable coin. We don't have the date here in the notes, but I think that was in February or March. Let's always have the dates here so we can really understand the industry tightly. Yesterday, Stripe made a second purchase, which was a wallet company named Privy. And so these two, I guess the thesises are some way related and that Stripe is going to give their partners, maybe even customers, I don't know. Are they going to go to the customer level and let people have wallets and then let people buy stuff with stable\n\n\nCoins, or are they going to be the provider of stable coins to their top merchants so they can make their own? This is a theory, you know, I've been thinking about, like, maybe everybody who does over a billion dollars in transactions could have their own stable coin. If I send you a million dollars in Amazon as a supplier, and you give me a million dollars in Shopify, it's all the same thing. Who cares? They're all backed by US treasuries.\n\nWe're going to need some...\n\nYeah, you are. And I, I will point out that Privy is less of a consumer wallet service, Jason, and more of, like, wallet infrastructure. Sorry for the buzzwords, but it provides a technology that underpins crypto wallets. So, I wouldn't say consumer-facing. I mean, Stripe isn't, right? That's not their main thing. They're not trying to be a company my mom knows, but they want to be a company that everyone who sells to my mom uses. Uh, on the everyone with a billion dollars or more in revenue, I would pause on that for a second. I wonder if, you know, Stripe at some point will make a play for the consumer wallet, and if they're buying something that enables crypto wallets, why wouldn't Stripe have its own, you know, PayPal type product? I've always wondered, like, that would be quite creative. The reason I think that is because they said Shopify would never have, like, a portal, and they have Shop, and I have the Shop app, and I have shop.com. Uh-huh. And I find myself looking at the, you know, just on this, like, three or four times since they got a little more frisky and buying direct from different bespoke brands, as I was just buying stuff on Amazon, which I was finding, like, the quality was going down, and I was looking for the slightly higher quality products. So, these glasses that I wear, my readers, are from Kadis, K A D I S. Okay. And, you know, Kadis, I think, is a Shopify store. So, when my delivery comes, they put all my Shopify deliveries in one location, the Shop app. So now I have that app. I wonder if Stripe will make a play eventually for consumer wallets in some way. It could be. And, by the way, just so everyone knows, the Shop app is actually very highly ranked. It's currently number 21 on the US free iOS rankings. So, interesting. I mean, top 50 is a big deal. Top 25 is a hit. I'll add to your point though, Klarna has an app that lets you, I think, search around and buy things because they want to drive more GMV. So, why not help with that? So, I guess the question is, the buy now, pay later app is saying, if you here are the merchants who support buy now, pay later. So, if you're buying things in installments, start here. It's almost like those stores, what were those stores called? Layaway stores that existed in the 80s or 90s. You could go to a store that you could rent to buy. Remember those stores? Rent-to-buy stores. Rent-a-Center. Rent-a-Center. Correct. So, maybe that's kind of like Rent-a-Center for them. Interesting. So, that seems to be an interesting theme. If you own the merchants, you own the businesses at some point. Do you subtly make a play for consumers? And the Shopify, the reason, do you have Shop app on your phone?\n\nI do not. I do not have it on my phone. So, if you, the reason to get it is if you buy something, they kind of push you towards it to get your updates on shipping.\n\nAnd so, for shipping updates, it's like reminding you, but when you go in and look at your shipping, like, oh, your Cadence glasses are coming, it's like, and, by the way, by the way, your glasses are coming, and if your glasses are coming, here's some other things that are related to glasses previously. I thought so. I thought, I thought that might be the corollary there. Uh, the only thing that I'll say, just thinking about this out loud with you, is I think it's really cool to see Stripe expanding its product remit, but I just don't want to see it trying to eat space in the market that other companies kind of fill, because I think that would be, I don't know. We don't need any more incredibly broad incumbents that want to do everything. I kind of like that Stripe does, like, five things really, really well. I wonder if they would be good at consumer, but at the same time, I guess all companies need to keep growing. So, we'll see if that happens. Um, one more data point here, Jason, is that when I was going through the Y Combinator batch of companies, not a single stable coin entry in that list for this last cycle. That, that really surprised me. I thought there would be three, just because... What's your analysis of that as a classically trained journalist, and then I'll give you the insiders. We'll see if we're in sync. Okay. Why? Okay, let me just one clarifying question. Why are founders making less stable coin companies, or did YC admit no stable coin-focused founders? Probably both of those things are true, but generally speaking, the accelerators don't define what the companies are. They accept the best teams and what they're working on. So, I think you could leave the YC part out. YC is going to pick the best founders, and the founders are going to pick what they work on. So, if you come with that premise, then it means less founders are doing stable coin companies. Why would less founders engage in the stable coin company building stable coin companies?\n\nI think it's because that opportunity to build them was 5 to 10 years ago. Yeah. Whenever these stable coin bridge, whenever Bridge was started, that was probably the ideal time, and the exit was a billion dollars. Whenever Tether started, that was over 10 years ago, and USDC was probably six or seven years ago. So, I think they probably think this is an established technology, and there's no opportunity here. Not dissimilar to hard drives, you know, like, why aren't there hard drive startups, you know? It's like, are you kidding? Like, that technology, they've rung every ounce of it. They get 5% better a year. It's a mass commodity, low margin business. So, that's what happens with tech opportunity goes away. I can imagine a couple things here, because going back to your point about the $1 billion revenue, making your own stable coin, if you're going to eventually want to be able to trade Stripe bucks for Amazon bucks, you're going to need a centralized place that can do the swapping with regulatory approval and such. That's a cool idea. I still think more... I mean, or maybe you just... Maybe the market is so robust, you just have a wallet, and the CFO at Amazon has a wallet, the CFO at, you know, wherever, has a wallet, and their bank, Wells Fargo, supports it, or they don't, and they just send direct, and, like, the money is in a wallet. I mean, I know that sounds crazy, but I think that's where this is headed. Yeah. Oh, well, okay. Well, maybe there's less room than I thought, but I will say we do have two of them, uh, stable coin-focused on the TWiST500. So, I'm hoping that those...\n\nWhat do those two do? And that's actually a really good thing to look at, because then we could play the game, rule by them, or what's is their opportunity still valid. That's a very interesting thread we're pulling here.\n\nFounders are all about performance. That's how we do it. That's why founders are optimizing every part of their startup, whether it's your CRM, your cap table, your hiring process. But when's the last time you optimized yourself, your health, your mental well-being? Well, now there's a way for you to monitor all this and manage it better. It's called Superpower. I am obsessed with this company. I've gifted it to, like, five of my family members and team members already. It's the ultimate founder health membership, and it keeps high performers at their peak.

I wish I had this 20 years ago, but I'm going to use it for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years. Whatever I get on this planet, I'm going to be a subscriber to superpower.com/twist.\n\nOkay, so this is what happens when a, when a, when a market becomes robust, all the players are looking and saying, \"Okay, we're, we're, we're leaving the midgame in chess.\" You know, you have, like, the opening. Opening happened 5 years ago. We're in the midgame right now, and then we're about to enter the endgame. The pieces are consolidating, right? In the endgame, the, you have less pieces, and the pieces are more developed. The pieces here are Bridge getting bought and Privy getting bought by Stripe, USDC going public, the G, what was the act called? Uh, the Genius Act. Genius Act, right? I got that right. The Genius Act, maybe even Tether getting more legitimized and moving to audits. All of that is endgame behavior. So, okay. I think we're in the beginning of the endgame. This is the beginning of the endgame. Let's go over those two companies, and let's see what they do. Call it an audible here, and then we'll try to guess the outcome, and then we'll look a year from now. We'll put a reminder in Notion to remind us in 6 months to check every 6 months if we got this right. Notion is such a great piece of software. I'm, I'm filibustering while Alex does this. But Notion is such a great piece of software. notion.com/twist, I think, is our code that you can literally put reminders in it to remind you in a document, like, how cool is that? Like, the document or database will remind you to check it. Okay, I think we used to call that no code, sorry, low code, but now it's just a standard feature. All right, answer your question. This is the first one we added to the TWiST500. It's called Stably, and the reason why I picked it initially was it offered what it calls stablecoin as a service. And you and I share a thesis in which we think people are going to make a lot of stables. Why reinvent the wheel? Why not go to the company that's good at it? They have expanded, Jason, into doing some other stuff, including some kind of on-off ramps for stable coins. Now, I think this number, this .5% VIG, is going to go down as there's more competition, but they have expanded. Who buys it? Who buys it? I mean, you can make an argument that Circle buys it just for one, take it off the market. I mean, they, you would be a buyer, build, and if they have this would get bought for one of two reasons: the technology is so advanced that you want to save a year building it if it's, you know, a year build. Yeah. So, somebody like, you know, some companies like Apple or Elon or Tesla, they're build folks. They have, like, an incredible dexterity in building stuff. They don't buy. Other folks, like Zuckerberg, they're good at building, but they're not innovative, obviously, so they like to buy. So, and then Google kind of sits in between. Google will make a Gmail. They'll make their own Chrome browser, but they're also frisky and will buy a YouTube, you know, now and again. So, I think this gets bought for that reason.\n\nYou want to save a year by one of those companies, or it gets bought by a legacy player who doesn't have the ability to ever get this done, or if they did have a number of key customers, and you're Stripe, and you want to enable a bunch of this, or you're Bank of America, and you decide this is critical for you, you're kind of buying the customer base. So, just something to think about as a company. Okay, the endgame's happening. What happens to your company?\n\nA legacy player will overpay. American Express, Visa, they'll overpay. Banks, why will they overpay? Because they want to get those leaders into the company to jumpstart the company. Yes. Uh, somebody who is has dexterity might buy you to save time and to get your customer base. So, you can work on those three things. Every customer you get, it makes it easier for an acquirer to justify the acquisition because they don't have to close that customer, and you might be, you know, in the skunk works and hard to rip out. That's a really good, uh, sort of thing. And what's the second one? Any question, any questions on that analysis? No, I, I don't disagree with it. I'm just trying to figure out what it's worth. Uh, because I think that if you're selling to Visa, Mastercard, you're selling potential team and technology over revenue. You know, how fast are your customers buying more and so forth? You're buying more potential. So, let's just say that it was valued at, I don't know, let's say 100 last time, you could probably get Visa to pay you four or five for it. I can see that 100 if it's valued at 100 million. The way people will make these acquisitions is, um, a legacy company will, with a lot of cash, they'll just make a very, um, some people might say, not logical bet. They'll overpay, in other words, because they could see this as a threat to the mothership. So, if they have a hundred billion business, and they spend, you know, a billion dollars on this, that 1% of their market cap to buy this, if they felt that this was going to be a headwind against them, and they could lose 10% of their market share, but if they spend 1%, maybe they only lose 5% market share. So, that would be, like, the defensive justification. The M&amp;A team might come in to the person at American Express, Visa, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and give that justification. Hey, we got to defend the castle. The other one would be the opportunistic one. Hey, we have 10,000 customers who all would want to participate in stable funds in some way. If we convert 1% of them a year, that's a hundred new customers. Each new customer is worth a million dollars a year, lifetime value of $10 million. Therefore, you know, every hundred of them we get is a billion dollars in revenue and lifetime value. We can easily afford to pay for this if we just execute on a 1% thing. That would be the opportunistic way to look at the acquisition. is defensive and then growth opportunistic. I'm doing a little bit of math right here, and I'll explain why in a second. Uh, here we go. I can do division without touch typing. Okay. So, one thing you're talking about a little bit, Jason, is how much of a company's worth do they spend on an acqu...\n\n\nIs it an acquisition? And this is a really great rule of thumb that everyone should use when they look at a deal because often you'll see a large dollar amount and think, \"Oh, this is an enormous transaction for the buyer.\" When in reality, it's not. So, we're going to talk a little bit later on about Meta essentially purchasing scale, and they put in $112 billion. Oh my gosh, $112 billion. Well, that works out to 6% of their market cap today, right? More or less. So, that's a rough calculation. Don't quote me on that. But, I mean, it's not much the company's total worth. This is the way to assess them is to look at the percentage of your market cap and then say number one, what does this give us in additional market cap? Or number two, how does this protect the kingdom?\n\nWhen Amazon bought Whole Foods, for $12-$14 million. It was something in that range. Um, and it was a long time ago. So they bought it for almost $14 billion. The stock went up $30-$40 billion the next day, which is another way of saying they got it for free. Yes. No, they they got paid to acquire it. There you go. In in a certain way. Um, now you want to look at the revenue quality because you could have the market cap go down. You could you could lose a billion dollars a year running Whole Foods, etc. So you do have to integrate well, and for every three you buy, every three Whole Foods you buy, two of them go to zero. So that's another rule of thumb. So it better you know grow, but this is why the wrath of Lena Khan was so damaging to our industry is people stopped taking big swings and thinking big, and we want companies thinking big. We want them thinking, hey, if we put these two things together, we can compete with a bigger player. Hey, if we buy this, we can add a new service and give it for free to customers or at a discount. All of this is accretive to lower prices for consumers. I I've we had this discussion, I think, when you first started here as co-host of like, give me an example of an acquisition that resulted in higher costs or lower choice customer. And it's like, you could there's many places you can post images other than Instagram. You can use many different messaging apps than WhatsApp. There's a zillion other ones of each of those, and those are still free.\n\nWell, I mean I I guess because I was looking at this uh earlier on today, DoorDash bought Walt, Uber Eats bought Insta Cart, not Instacart. Um Postmates, Postmates, Postmates. So, we have seen some contraction occasionally, but those have remained robust competitive markets, which I think is I I think it's okay to say that a deal might be constrictive of competition, but because there's so many players still left, it's sufficiently competitive to not warrant risk. And I think that's where Lena Khan went a little bit wrong because I think she thought that any reduction in competition was net bad without thinking about the broader market itself. If I can be a little bit broad, I think it's a pretty good way to phrase it. I think she thought anything that could potentially harm future competition should not be done. Yeah.\n\nWell, you know, according to who? Whose judgment? Lena Khan, who's never run a business before, who's never started a company, who's never been in venture capital, has zero skin in the game, some elitist Ivy League theorist writing papers, no offense. Uh, I said offensive things, but no offense, but an elitist person sucks, but I love you. No, but I mean an elitist, you know, uh, idol with no skin in the game and no experience in the trenches, you know, in the arena is like, I think I can predict what's going to happen in the future.\n\nInvestors like me are not going to invest in your business unless you're structured properly. So founders, if you're serious about raising money, you need to set up your business the right way. And that starts with a registered agent. Before a venture capitalist can wire you a single dollar, they're going to check if your company is incorporated and it's in good standing and it's compliant. That's where Northwest Registered Agent comes in. For just $39 plus state fees, they're going to handle your paperwork, keep you compliant, and make sure investors see you as a serious business concern that's worth putting money into. In just 10 clicks and 10 minutes, your business is officially investor ready. Thousands of founders trust Northwest. So don't let paperwork cost you your next funding round. Go to northwestregisteredagent.com/quist and get your business investor ready today. For just $39 plus state fees, you can set up your company the right way. Fast, private, and compliant. Go to northwestregistered agent.com/twist today.\n\nHere's what 99 out of a hundred of these things proved. Uh, things get cheaper for customers. Customers' lives get better. Like I'm trying to think of an example of any acquisition where things got worse. Even the one you're talking about, you know, where there was consolidation in food delivery, and there has been some. Yeah. Yeah. What was bought were tended to be the unprofitable, you know, dying companies or sideways companies that everybody throw the writing on the wall like Lyft's not going to make it out, Postmates wasn't going to make it out, you know, whatever, GrubHub this or whatever. Like they were just things that were Yeah, exactly. There were they were kind of things that just weren't as good as the ones that consumers selected. So, in that case, consumers picked DoorDash because DoorDash, listen, I'm going to I'm team Uber, you know that, but I think DoorDash had a better interface and had better restaurants on it. They were about 20% better on a product basis. That's why they were leading. Uber has since caught up. Uber has added some other things, but I would still give a 5% edge, maybe a 10% edge to DoorDash's UX. I think they've just they've polished it a little bit better, and I think they had some exclusives, and that's called competition. And their fees are still going down. The fees are going down. The membership programs are going up.\n\nThe robots are all over LA. I There are Cocoa robots everywhere on Melrose Place. I'm I'm staying in the like Melrose uh you know place, you know, kind of area of LA this week and I have seen I don't know if it's the same five, but I have seen no less than 50 deliveries going on. And these things are the same five robots. It might be the same five. And I just they're they're on the same five blocks. But these cocoos are everywhere on Melrose Place. And just to add to this everybody, uh Coco recently raised $80 million according to my dear friend Rebecca Screw over at Techrun. Um I actually didn't have this little bit of data, Jason, in the uh the docket. I cut it to focus on some other rounds, but because you brought it up, I wanted to throw it out there. Can we add them? I think we should add them to the um robotics section of Chris 500 or at least consider them and we should check that we have those other robotic companies in it.\n\nThose robotic companies people are not taking people are not taking into account exactly how impactful robots are going to be. I have just two examples. Okay, those robots. And then if you can pull up Figure tweeted on and it's the number one on their uh this is the number one story I think on their X feed Figure Robotics. Remember Figure the company Figure? They make a humanoid robot. They were raising at an extraordinary valuation. I think it was close to 40 billion. People were complaining the back channel inside the industry was it was a bunch of SPV, special purpose vehicles with what venture capitalists consider Genpop, you know, rich dentists putting in money on a pre-revenue company that didn't even have a product in market. That was the claim. That was the back channel. That's what the hand wringing was about. You might have even seen RUF say, \"We're back into this market where SPVS are being done by people with no skin in the game.\" In other words, the, you know, the people who are running these SPVS aren't putting their money in. They're just getting the value of it. And so, they don't care what the valuation is cuz they didn't pay for it. You put all that together, uh, and then there was this famous BMW story where the BMW, their lighthouse customer, the customer that was supposed to convince you to pay 40 billion, was uh, said something like, \"Yeah, we're not using that in production.\" And then like two days later was like, \"Well, we are in production.\" So obviously this got to the founder. I think this is my dime source psychologist. I think this got to the founder of Figure who probably was like, \"Yeah, you know, they're accusing me of securities fraud here. This is pretty serious. Uh, I'm going to prove that our product kicks butt.\" So they've released not a six-minute video, a 60-minute video of a figure robot. And I'm going to talk over it here. Alex is a figure robot. It's on a tether, I believe. I think it's hanging from a tether because these things don't stand very well. Um, so they're not like the Boston Dynamics one, but this is sorting packages, putting the barcode down, and then moving it. And so pretty slick.\n\nSo yes and you're tech you've been covering technology for two decades. So you understand that if it can do this today, next week it will be going 15% faster and then every 6 weeks it will be going twice as fast until physics like the physics of you know moving objects in the world but this will become lightning fast and if the error rate here I don't know if there was an error rate stated but it was just given the general um it was given a very general kind of like a chat GPT prompt. Hey, just put the um just put the um bar face down, right? And and Jason, just to be clear, this is not CGI. This is not this is an actual figure robot doing this. That's my understanding. Okay. So So two things stand out about this. One, the dexterity of the robots tremendous. Just backing up your point that things are moving very quickly. But also this I think details precisely and exactly why I'm pretty excited about having more robots in the market and why I'm very bullish on humanoid robots in particular. This job sucks, right? Like, who wants to I don't want to stand there and do what is this? A package a second all day long. Just It looks like it's doing one, two. Well, we stopped at a weird time here. Four, five. It did two and 5 seconds. It looks like six seconds. Do one every 3 seconds right now. So, 20 a minute. Yeah. Yeah. So, you're correct. Um, now, how many people work in Amazon factories doing something like this? We'll assume this gets 10% better every month. Every seven months is twice as good. So, this will be doing oddsiz packages, larger packages, dealing with errors. It'll be doing a lot of other like slightly more complicated. But you're right, people are getting paid 15 to $20 an hour to do backbreaking monotonous labor like this, which is kind of akin to being in a torture chamber. Let's call it what it is. To spend 8 hours doing that is it's work. it. Listen, I no judgments. You got to pay for your kids food. Got to pay for shelter. I'm not making any judgments on people. I've been there. Literally, I've been there in life when, you know, I was working week to week to have food on my table and watch my parents do it. So, no judgment on the people, but as a human, as you're pointing out, to do this kind of labor is soul crushing. You can do it in a fun way. You can make the best of it, but it's soul crushing for 15 bucks an hour, 10 bucks an hour. These will cost $1 an hour and they will work 23.9 hours a day. Yeah. Just got to plug them in and squirt some WD40 on them and off they go. You're done. You're done. So, the job disruption the the job destruction, the job retirement that we're going to see, I'm writing a blog post on this I'm going to release this weekend is going to be greater than anybody anticipates. Uh and in our industry, okay, we don't want to talk about it anymore. My thesis is 5 years ago we would talk about it. Alex, you know why? Because it was hypothetical. No longer hypothetical.\n\nNobody was riding in them. Nobody was getting Coco or that other company, you know, delivering their burritos, serve robotics, delivering their burritos. Nobody had seen these robots doing things. And uh Cafe X, you know, I would get on the margins people saying like, \"Oh, is this going to get rid of every barista job?\" And I was like, \"It's going to get rid of a lot. It's going to get rid of the people who are not doing it for artistic artisal purposes because you want your coffee perfect. You go to Cafe X, it doesn't make a mistake. If there's a mistake, it's like, you know, educate. Whereas 30 40 50% of drinks at Dunkin Donuts and uh Starbucks have a mistake. Literally like one in three or four. Yeah. Uh so anyway, my thesis is job destruction in the hundreds of millions. I'm going to put it at four or 500 million according to my early estimates. I think four globally four or 500 million jobs 3 million 2 to three million jobs retired a year. I'll say 1 to three jobs I have to really refine this but I think 1 to three million jobs in the United States are going to be retired per year. So of the 60 million people, 62% of people participating in labor, 150 million people working jobs, I could see 1.5 to 3 million of those jobs going away per year. And what jobs replace them is the question. There will be jobs. How quickly? Because there could be a period of time in which we delete some jobs but haven't made the new jobs yet. I'm a very long-term believer that we're going to stay at full human employment for for forever, but I'm not convinced that there won't be a period in between the two. And that's what I'm concerned about for folks who currently make 15 bucks an hour doing this for for Amazon in the warehouse. But I have driven night shift berry harvesters for a farm for 12-hour shifts for eight bucks an hour and let me tell\n\n\nYou, worst job of my life. Like, it just sounds pretty rough, dude. You drive a 1 mile an hour in a straight line, and you just want to die. So yeah, I'm totally in favor of this.\n\nHere's my question: How did we get from stable coins to here? So, um, we were talking, I have no idea. The audience will tell us. We were talking, uh, oh yeah, acquisitions at the companies, right? Lena, competition, and then robots.\n\nOkay, I'm going to take us back to the beginning and just answer the other half of your question. The other company that we have in the TWiST500, and I've lost the tab now, is One Money, and they are building their own, uh, network blockchain strictly for stable coins. So the idea there, and this is a kind of a binary bet. It's either a billion dollars or it's zero. Um, is that existing blockchains are a bit slow, and so if you want to have something that can handle the kind of like transactions per second that a Visa or Mastercard handles, you're going to want something more purpose-built just for that. The anti-argument here is that base, the L2 that, uh, Coinbase runs, is very good. So, we'll see who, um, who ends up being right. But that's the latest on stable coins and competition and robotics.\n\nUh, pretty amazing how quickly, and you know, there's another founder lesson here that I think everybody should just internalize, um, because it's important. Sometimes it takes the third swing at the bat, fourth swing at the bat for these things to become reality. We saw ecash before the crypto movement. Then we saw crypto, then we saw ICOs, we saw all kinds of permutations over 20 years around digital currency, even PayPal, right? Um, and over that 30-year journey, it ended with the the optimal product is a stable coin. That's what consumers want. They don't want to worry about their money is going to disappear. They want to know it's back. They want it to be lightning fast. So, we came to a very basic conclusion that people knew in the PayPal days, the PayPal mafia knew it had to be safe and it had to be fast. So, you had to trust it and it had to be fast. And it just turned out the manifestation of that was a stable coin.\n\nRobotics, we knew it had to be intelligent. We knew it had to be predictable. And we knew it had to be cheap. Those Boston Dynamics ones were absurdly expensive. You know, those are half million million dollar. Yeah. You know, units, but they didn't have LLMs. They didn't have, you know, an ability to say what's on the table in front of me. Yeah. Put the barcode face down. And it's like, I know what a barcode is, and I know what face down is because I'm a language model. That's pretty basic.\n\nSo the manifestation of that was a large language model in commodity hardware that was driven to that point by the smartphone and the EV revolution, which made small batteries and incredible sensors and incredible processors and video games from Nvidia. So the ultimate manifestation can be predicted if you just assume all the technological barriers become cheap, and then it's just a matter of when it arrives.\n\nThis is getting so cheap that, uh, I couldn't find it in my notes, so I'm not going to spend five minutes looking for it, but there's a company in their latest spicy batch that made a $200 robotic arm that you can prompt using natural language, and it can play chess for you. Robotic arms used to be industrial only that cost you a bajillion dollars, and you need to set up for one single use on a assembly line for cars, and they would do one weld 20 billion times. Now they're just desktop toys you can program with with English. I mean that it just makes me so excited, Jason. The future's going to be freaking awesome, and I'm I'm excited about it.\n\nSo yeah, these two or three joint, um, gantry robots, I think they're called. Um, is, uh, you know, there's there's different types of these, but I think that's a gantry, um, cartisian gantry robots. Uh, three linear axis providing straight line movement are well suited for pick and place tasks and assembly. And those have been around for a long time. They are wildly expensive, and they're mounted, and you mount them, and you pay, I think they, you know, they got down in the the ones in the Cafe X machines, you know, it's pretty public knowledge. You can look at them. I think when they started, those were $30,000, $40,000, and now they're $10,000. If you want to have an industrial one that you can run for 10 years and not worry about. Now if you want one for home use and you're just going around, yeah, I could see conceivably making a $500 one.\n\nSo, here is, uh, the latest entry. This is Vassor Robotics. I did find it. And, uh, here is the demo I was watching earlier today that when I was going through the, uh, latest cohort from YC, it's doing like a language model commentary on its moves, but it's janky. But here's the thing: 200 bucks, and it's sold out.\n\nYeah. But toys become tools. Uh, that is a another pattern in Silicon Valley where things that feel like toys quickly become, you know, uh, tools, and that toy like Canva was a toy for a lot of people. Um, like Microsoft Paint was kind of a toy, uh, Canva was kind of a toy, then they become essential, and that will start and like that looks like something like for educational use to have fun, like Legos, that's like kind of modernday Lego, and smart of them to, you know, make them as Paul Graham always says, you know, founder of YC, do things that don't scale. It looks like a 3D printed, you know, janky, easy to criticize, you know, weird looking product, they sold out. How many did they do? A 100? You come up with a million.\n\nIt just like people did with the Roadster. Oh, he's making 100 Roadsters for 150K. It's a Lotus Elise. It doesn't have power steering. It's It's loud. It has no suspension. When you hit a pothole, you feel like your fillings are going to come out of your teeth. Like, this was the criticism of that car. And now you have Model Y self-driving around Austin. You know, I've seen the videos. I've seen clips. You know, I I kind of feel like there should be a safety driver in them for the first year, you know, putting aside Tesla or any company. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, just to go off on another divergent here, I think like having driven FSD since inception, and you know, I I just got the latest Juniper. It's unbelievable. But I think it's probably an intervention every hour for me on the hardware 4 and two interventions an hour on hardware 3. And there's a website. It's really cool. There's a website tracking disengagements, what they call critical disengagements. And there's an amazing group on Reddit if you want to really get into FSD and where it's at today. The FSD group and then this other group of like Tesla super fans. They're recording through the computer and uploading all of the data and tell telem. What is that word? Telemetry. Telemetry. Thank you. And they're publishing it. So, if you find this FSD tracker, I think it's called FSD tracker. Tesla.\n\nYeah, FSD community tracker. Tesla fsdracker.com.\n\nThere's a bunch of software. Uh, one of them is called Matter Key. And this is like super interesting. Uh, and it shows the number of drives with one or no disengagements.\n\nUm, city distance to critical disengagement, uh, in kilometers and miles. And so you can see over time what this different software is. And right now it's saying every 200 miles there's a critical disengagement. Well, 200 miles is incredible achievement. It's going straight up. So this is, um, you, I've been down the FSD rabbit hole. Uh, and FSD is extraordinary. I, you know, my gut tells me just to appease regulators and avoid, you know, what happened to Cruise and Uber and Whimo in the early days, which and Zuks just happened, you know, these little fender benders or, god forbid, a human getting hit, that's going to happen in all self-driving cars, Teslas, Whimos, it's just a matter of time, like random stuff happens. So we should be judging these based on how much safer they are, as you've pointed out, than human drivers, but that's not judged by regulators or the public or the press or just society at large. The majority of people are looking for these, I've come to the conclusion, to be superhuman, not human. Superhuman means I think perhaps LAR to see through fog and see through rain, which obviously Tesla's taken a different approach, although they're testing mules. I saw on this FSD forum on Reddit. But here's the data: Number of drives with no critical disengagements, 98% of drives. So, you know, basically it means like you could do 98 drives out of 100 and not have a disengagement. But that also means one in 50 people who take, imagine if one in 50 people taking a Whimo got a critical disengagement. That would be often, that means if you used it, you know, daily, or if you used it, you know, when you go out to dinner twice a week, four a week, 200 a year, you would experience one a quarter, one critical disengagement a quarter. That's too much for a human's brain to process. They will videotape it. It'll become a social media thing. Yes, etc. Just like it did for Whimo when that Whimo went around in a circle.\n\nSo, I think they should, I think the states should have the right to make their decisions. I don't think this should be a federal mandate because I believe in states rights. Number two, I think that they should have safety drivers be the standard for all autonomous driving for the first year or X number of miles, 100,000, million miles, whatever it is. Because a safety driver cost nothing, and they have the safe, they have, my understanding is they said there's two or three safety drivers per car for Tesla during the test, and that there's one, uh, or 1.5 for Whimo, you know, these backup drivers who are monitoring everything. So if that's the case, like there's no shame in the safety driver game. Put one in there for the first year and just have them sit there and talk to the customers and put their hands down and say, here, watch it, you go, I'm here in case there's a critical disengagement, a kitten runs across there, cuz we want to be better than humans.\n\nAnd here you see, um, city distance to critical disengagement. Uh, and this is only for people who have 2,000 miles reported. This yellow chart here, and as you can see, uh, you know, back when it was 10 and 11 and 12, you know, people were going version number, version number of the software. Thank you. Uh, you know, people were going 61 miles, then 146 miles, back down to 110, then all of a sudden in 12 and three, 148 and 237. So that's really, that slope is very notable. It's getting better and better and better. It will be getting probably exponentially better, but still every 200 miles, if the average ride is five, that means every 40, which was the math we just did, every 40 rides you get a disengagement. That's a little too much for consumers. Um, now of those, some number will be picked up by the remote drivers who are connecting to the car over LTE. Who knows, maybe he'll put a satellite dish in those. I was about to say who owns a satellite internet, you put Starlink in there, it would be even, I don't know if the latency would be lower than 5G actually, the top line bandwidth would be higher, but maybe more consistent or maybe just have both and and you just send the information on both, and if one, you know, you have some sort of redundancy, actually, that's probably what they would do, that's what I would do. So, uh, because the cost is so dimminimous, uh, so here you go, uh, keep an eye on that, and then the FSD group in Reddit, you can see all the nuances. For example, they figured out, uh, it's amazing what this crowd sourcing can do. They, there's a thing where if there's tire tracks on the road, you know, somebody peeled out or slammed on the brakes and they left tire tracks. Confuses the hell out of cameras. It thinks there's something on the road, which makes total sense. You think about a camera, all of a sudden there's a black streak, and it's a random black streak. It's not a predictable black. The car could have slammed on the brakes for 1 second, for 5 seconds. It could have spun out and made a circle. It's just like some random blackness. And I think that's where LiDAR wouldn't get confused. And so I have a feeling Tesla's going to have a very successful launch, but I think it should be very slow and steady with safety drivers. That's my best advice is safety drivers for the first 6 months or a year. Let them talk to people.\n\nI don't know what you think about the sort of deployment of this technology, but Whimo took five years with safety drivers, right? Something like that. Yeah, they took, they took forever. My question is, would you have this done on a per market basis or a perfleet basis? For example, Whimo is going to go to DC next year. Would you say that Whimo needs to have safety drivers for the DC market itself or because they've already done this in other cities, they don't need it anymore? That Whimo does safety drivers every time they go to new city because each city is unique. That's what I was shooting for here. So essentially, I think that your 100,000 or million mile mark I would do on a per market basis for all these companies, per city, per geo. And I, I used Whimo two or three times while I was here. Mhm. The wait times are terrible. Uh, the cost is more expensive than Uber. Uh, but it's kind of rock solid in the area of LA that it's in. It's on surface streets. I thought it was actually too aggressive. There were a couple of moves that Whimo did that I was like, that's a little too aggressive. Uh, like it cut somebody off. And so I was looking at it and I was like, I'm kind of shocked that a Whimo hasn't gotten into a serious accident in Los Angeles cuz people in LA are frisky with the way they drive. And I I I can't believe, you know, I think it's just amazing they haven't gotten into a serious accident yet or that that data is not out there. And the only caveat I'll give you to that data I was just showing at tesla fsdttracker.com is there's been a lot of back and forth of if you should trust that data because I've heard both arguments. These people are out to get Tesla. They're shorts and these people are super fans. They're long the stock. So when you h when you add a stock and a bet like Poly Market, shout out to our friends at Poly Market. I don't know\n\n\nIf they have a robo taxi, but we should pull it up if they do.\nThat would be pretty cool.\nUh, the when there's a public market stock at stake here, you could have people place a bet for a million dollars and then fake a crash in a Tesla.\nUm, and there was a very controversial Tesla crash where the person claims FSD drove them off the road, and it was actually there was data that the person jogged the steering wheel before it went off the road and disengaged the FSD.\nOh, so that's not so good.\nBut they but the person driving claims they were still in FSD, but the data shows they moved the wheel.\nSo this is kind of like shows one of those gray areas between the two.\nMhm.\nUh, oh, here we go.\nWill Tesla launch a driverless robo taxi service before July?\nThis was the most pertinent poly market I could find.\n28% chance.\nBut let's look at how they settle the bet.\nWhen you're doing a poly market, you want to know how this is reconciled.\nSo, the rules.\nThis market will resolve to yes if Tesla publicly launches a fully driverless taxi service by June 30th, 11:59 p.m. Eastern time.\nOtherwise, it will resolve to no.\nAny service that allows a member of the general public to summon and ride in a Tesla vehicle operating without any human on board or remote.\nOh, okay.\nActively controlling the vehicle will count.\nA human may be present in the vehicle or monitor remotely for emergency intervention, but they must not be physically positioned to take control.\nFor example, no safety driver in the driver's seat and must not actively steer, break, accelerate, or otherwise drive the car under normal operation.\nThat seems fair when they fully explain.\nI think that's a good way to resolve it.\nAnd I think that's probably this is why the devil's in the details.\nYes, there it's all likelihood that this will be still be in private beta and you would need to be accepted to the program.\nSo a public member couldn't just download an app and do it like you can just download Whimo now in Los Angeles.\nYou don't need permission.\nSo all right, great show.\nUh anything else we need to get to in terms of uh housekeeping here?\nUh on the housekeeping side of things?\nUm no.\nI have a really great Reddit rapid response for Monday for us to get through.\nOh, you want to do it today?\nLet's do it.\nYeah.\nI love a rapid response.\nA Reddit rapid response.\nHere we go.\nAll right.\nSo, I was over on our dear sister forum.\nOh, by the way, Reddit is suing somebody.\nWe didn't touch on that.\nDid you see that?\nReddit is suing somebody for uh ingesting their forums.\nAnd then there was This was the last week.\nWe missed it.\nThe Anthropic.\nSo, they're suing Anthropic.\nAnd then Disney is suing another company.\nSo all this Journey, Mid Journey is Disney is suing the Nudify people who did the that AI app.\nSo quite a lot of Okay, let me break it down for everybody.\nReddit, the online social forum is suing Anthropic, the foundation AI model company, best known for its Claude family, if you will.\nThe problem is Reddit's kept telling them, \"Please stop scraping us.\"\nAnd Anthropic's been scraping them.\nNow, I'm sure both sides will have allegations, but there's now a lawsuit.\nThe second thing Jason's talking about is Disney, the famous consumer media brand, suing Midjourney, which makes Generative AI models that make videos and images.\nNot a huge shock to see that.\nAnd then what's going on with Meta and Nudify?\nThey're suing the parent company of that service to stop advertising on their platform because they've kept doing that even though Meta said no because they didn't want to be associated with taking money from apps that will make uh Jason, help me out here.\nWhat's the term for when you make a synthetic to somebody.\nReal non-conensual artificial potential.\nYeah.\nNudes.\nI guess it's disgusting.\nYeah.\nSo, um the first two are the really important ones on an industry.\nThe the third one's obvious.\nYou shouldn't do this stuff.\nIt's illegal and they're going to pass laws for it.\nThe first two are really worth meditating on.\nI've been saying for a year, you should not be able to take Disney's characters and make Jedi.\nThat's their opportunity in the market.\nYou can be certain Disney is evaluating what consumers will pay to make, you know, our, you know, birthday card with me as a Jedi.\nIf you, if Disney offered me to make Jedi nights, I was just at Disneyland.\nI did um Rise of the Republic, Rise of the Rebellion is incredible ride.\nDisneyland's an incredible experience.\nMy my daughters want to go to Star Wars section immediately.\nAnd they sell the ability for you to buy a lightsaber and construct it.\nThey sell Jedi robes.\nThey sell pictures of you on the rides.\nIt's like the whole It's their IP that they spent billions of dollars on.\nTens of billions have been invested in it.\nThey bought it for billions of dollars.\nThe opportunity to create a Jedi image with you as a customer is Disney's and Disney's alone.\nAnd the fact that you can make a Jedi version of somebody on one of these services is because they ingested Disney's IP.\nYes.\nThey didn't train it, by the way.\nThey stole it.\nThey stole it.\nThey took it without permission.\nYep.\nThat's stealing.\nYou can't steal people's IP.\nSo, if somebody wants to create Shrek, Minions, Spider-Man, Darth Vader, it should say, \"We don't have the rights to those characters.\nYou can make a green orb.\nYou could make uh a samurai with a laser sword, but you can't make these other ones.\nGo to Disney, which has that opportunity.\nAnd by the way, Claude or Gro or Chatt, what an amazing opportunity.\nGive Disney a billion dollar deal for a hundred million a year to be the official partner to make these things and let them uh promote it for you and share revenue.\nAnd now you've figured out a way for the writers and for the artists to get paid and the companies that own their art get paid even more.\nTo underscore Jason's point here, we're not going to get to it.\nWe don't have time, but Tolit 500 company that does kind of the marketplace between IP and AI companies.\nJason, also created by humans and yes, I'm an investor and created by humans.\nYes, there's another one on the list as well that's escaping me now.\nThey dropped a report all about essentially AI scraping and how prevalent it is and how much is happening.\nUh the latest change here is that now most AI scrapes are not coming from model training but from rag essentially when you do a search and it goes out to find information for you.\nThose are now the majority case and the amount of traffic that is sent back remains effectively dimminimous.\nSo I think you're you're describing one facet of a larger problem, but we have not figured out how to repay IP holders for simple make the decision.\nIf you're willing to pay $6 billion to Johnny Iive for his company, you should be willing to pay a billion dollar for Disney for 10 years.\nLike literally, you could buy all the rights to the Disney characters for a billion dollars.\nI'm sure they would go for that.\nBut you're giving Johnny I six.\nSo, it just shows how, you know, I think people haven't thought this through.\nLicense Reddit like Google did for 50 million, hundred million a year.\nIt's not a lot of money compared to the value you're getting.\nYes.\nAnd then Reddit should be looking at their top contributors and saying, \"We've created a contributor fund.\nPeople who have accounts over 5 years old and that have done over a,000 posts are now going to get uh 20% revshare in the licensing data we have.\"\nand then just start shipping them Reddit gold and they can donate it to charity or they can sign up and $1099 when they hit $1,000 or $500 and take that money out.\nThere could be a beautiful system here that shows the world how to do it correctly.\nIt's not too difficult.\nWhat I just described could be built in under 30 days by the entire industry.\nChoosing not to do this.\nThey're choosing not to do it.\nWell, because right now it's free.\nIf they win these lawsuits, they're not going to win.\nThey're going to lose.\nThey're going to lose and they're going to lose hard.\nLike when I and when I say lose, they're going to get injunctions against them.\nSo what they should be doing, Sam Walman's a great deal maker.\nIt's like his best skill.\nGoogle's got a lot of history with doing deals.\nJust go to folks and say, \"Hey, what would be reasonable for the next 5 years?\nLet's come up with a system for 5 years.\"\nIf people want the output of your characters, they want to put in prompts around your IP, we can alert you when that is.\nYou tell us your keywords and then when the output happens, we can say officially licensed by just like if you want to use Getty images as your big bold images on your blog, you have, you know, that's not fair use.\nNow, if you want to crop, you know, 5% of a low res or a third of a low res getty image and you're making commentary on it, yeah, you could do fair use, but if you're doing that every day all the time, you know, you're probably going to need to get permission.\nSo, there is like a balance here and just be thoughtful about it.\nThis is my message to the industry is like be fair.\nPut the fair in fair use.\nIt's very simple, folks.\nWell, I couldn't have said that better myself.\nAll right, Jason, do you want to do the red wrap response for Safer for Monday?\nI You know what?\nI've got a call with a founder right now.\nSo, I'm going to demirure.\nWe'll do it on Monday.\nMonday.\nAll right.\nFor Monday.\nYeah.\nThis week at Startups.comdocckit and uh we have a Tik Tok account that I want everybody to go find and an Instagram account.\nGo find those.\nFollow those and just say hi to us over there.\nWe're trying to build up those channels.\nAnd we'll see you all next time on This Week in Startups.\nHave a great weekend.\nBye everybody.\n",
