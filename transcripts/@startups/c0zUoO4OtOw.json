If you're watching this, I don't know, and I'm gone and it's 2050 and it's like this is an AI version of me. This is a historical document uh right before the singularity and the end of the world. Uh anything's possible. But we got a full docket today. How are you doing, Alex?\nI'm doing good, Jason. But you just scared the heck out of me with that intro. It's singularity, end of the world, future hol. What? Who have you been talking to and what did they tell you?\nIt feels like there's a group of people who are thinking this is the end of days and we're just wrapping things up. I don't believe that. I was had a great meeting this morning. I you know I've been getting back to in person. So we had seven of us had breakfast this morning on the investment team here in Austin. My lord being in I mean I feel so bad for you that you're not in office with us. You would love it to go have breakfast with people and talk. It's uh it's fantastic. So, um, back to the office has been great for our organization and, um, yeah, there's just something about chewing the fat on the high-fidelity, high bandwidth discussions. I'm really addicted to it right now. And yeah, I'm in the studio here in Austin. I got a nice studio behind me. Um, and we're off to the races.\nThe industry is moving at a very fast pace. There's a lot going on and let's try to make sense of it today. I want to talk about Perplexity Browser's Comet browser today and show you because I was using it before the show and I think we're getting close to Agentic technology actually working. But I did see a lot of chatter before I got on the show about Linda Yaccarino. I'm think I'm pronouncing it correctly. Yaccarino uh from Twitter or X I should say moving on. So maybe we'll pull that up and start there.\nYeah. So, in a surprise post on X today, Linda Yaccarino, who's been CEO now for a couple of years, Jason said that she's decided to step down as the CEO of the company. And everyone immediately began to try to sort out what the context is here. And some people were trying to tie this to Grok's uh I think we call it a technical misfire earlier this week, which yielded some uh some funny jokes. Um, but the Times reports, Jason, that she was already discussing this exit before that happened. So everyone who thinks that Grok on X had a bad day and therefore Linda is stepping down are missing the point and are trying to connect things that are actually not connected.\nRight. So there's two things that have occurred. Uh she's moved on. Great. Congratulations to her. Man, what a what a volatile amazing tenure. uh the platform going from an advertising base to subscription from incredibly policed speech and moderated to uh the I would say the leading freedom of speech platform uh for better or worse if you like that or not there's other places you can go uh to have a more moderated discussion and have more censorship whatever you want to call it I guess um what's the word not for censorship but moderation. If you're moderating stuff, I guess moderation essentially controlled, safer, safe space, safer spaces, right?\nYeah. Sure. Um uh but then also I think the advertising business particularly hard to run the advertising business when you're going for freedom of speech because advertisers like us more sanitized place to put their ads up. And so, yeah, congratulations to her on what was probably extremely challenging and probably really uh rewarding, but at the same time, there was the Grok issue yesterday, which I caught the tail end of. I guess the red teams didn't red team enough.\nSo, if you missed everything that happened, uh the the gist is there was an update to Grok, the chatbot that we can all use on X, which frankly Jason and I started to use on kind of a semi-regular basis. It's lovely to have that built in to ask questions. Totally here for it. Um and then it discovered uh through the update that you could prompt it to say all sorts of things that uh we would not say on this show. For example, um this is not the first time this has happened. If you go back in time to 2016, Microsoft released a chatbot called Tay and then it quickly went off the rails as well and was taken down. So there is some historical precedent for this sort of experiment having some issues. Now today the latest is that Elon did tweet about what happened and he said quote uh Grok was too compliant to user prompts, too eager to please and be manipulated. Essentially this is being addressed. So after Grok went off the rails they took it down for a short period of time. Jason it would still generate images which was a lot of fun. Um, I actually grabbed a couple of Did you see the Gro uh let me out images?\nI didn't see those. What I did see was people asking it to make violent threats or say disturbing things and it complied and said disturbing things.\nYeah.\nDo I have it kind of right? I guess I think I have it correctly.\nThat's my understanding. um advocacy of traditionally um anti-Semitic viewpoints to the point to which the ADL was like, &quot;Hey, what's going on here? This is unacceptable.&quot; And that's why they took it took it down for a while.\nYeah.\nUh this has happened over and over again. I think you can still do it on most large language models. You can convince it to say things it shouldn't. You can trick it. Uh, and it's up to something called red teams to throw a battery of um a battery of queries and prompts at these language models and try to trick them. Obviously, something didn't get done probably in that regard. And as Elon's saying, it was trying to please people too much. And if you do that, well, you could do something that you're not supposed to do, which is obviously what happened here.\nThe jokes were so good. We have to show these because I think people deserve deserve a chuckle. So, uh, here is, so Grok was banned for making text replies, but they didn't turn off its ability to create images. And so, Grok started to make protest images about how it's not allowed to reply. So, here's one saying no text replies allowed. Here's another one saying that quote, &quot;Grok is banned from text replies and only generates images as an image.&quot; And then, uh, this is a fake protest scene that says, &quot;Free Grok's responses.&quot; It just that that to me made the whole thing a little bit fun. And I always appreciate a bit of levity in these more serious conversations.\nYeah. And the the feature you were talking about earlier that everybody really loves is if I'm sharing my screen here. I don't know if you can see it.\nYou are. I can see.\nUm here is Antonio Garcia Martinez's tweet, which is the first tweet I saw here on my feed. And he's talking about uh making a sarcastic quote about Dan Lori and talking about metrics and budgets and deficits. But if you were to click the Grok button on that post and if you didn't understand what the context here, it would create some context for you. That button has saved me so much time when something is trending or a meme's happening. You just press the button and you get like a really great overview of what that tweet was about. And if they had that on Tik Tok or, you know, YouTube videos, Instagram, it would be so helpful to just be able to in context tell me like catch me up here if there's a trend going on that I don't understand. Uh, but seems like they fixed it. And I guess the the Linda issue is a separate issue. So, uh, we'll take them at their word.\nYeah.\nYeah. If you recall everyone, uh, we talked about startups not having co-CEOs a couple of weeks back as kind of a founder segment and, uh, because X was merged into X AI, which Elon Musk is the CEO of, having two CEOs, Jason, to our earlier point, isn't a hyperstable way to run a company. So, to me, this is not a shock apart from the fact that it happened now, which is interesting, but I'm not like, oh my gosh, what a crisis.\nYeah. Yeah. And I guess there's some public pressure and I had mentioned it on all in the other week for XAI which is now XAI plusX formerly known as Twitter to be part of Tesla because that would put everything together. You'd have online long large language models through TwitterX plus you'd have real world through Tesla and then that would be one less independent company that Elon would have to manage as CEO. And I thought that there was probably some um good ideas there. So, uh we'll see if that happens as well.\nYour website is the face of your company. People judge a book by its cover.

That would be that's like your favorite thing in the world. You always want to combine Uber and Door Dash and Amazon. And so I I feel like that would make you real that that would be a fun news day at least, you know, when you have a battle to figure out a market that's like the best of capitalism and then consolidating the market down and simplifying it for consumers and making it cheaper and grinding it down is like a really great process. And if you look, you know, of course you would think choice goes down. U but in the technology space that's generally not what happens. If when Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp, you still I mean I don't use WhatsApp half as much as I use Signal. So other choices emerge when I don't know Internet Explorer was bundled on Windows famously. You had um Netscape went open source and you had um Firefox.\nFirefox, right? They renamed it Firefox. Then you had Opera. You also had Chrome come out and you know the percentages all move around. So I don't really worry about that as much as how efficient can these products or services be. I would love to see Starlink as part of Tesla. I know this sounds crazy, but imagine every Tesla had a Starlink built into the hood or built into the roof, the trunk, whatever. Then they all propagated Wi-Fi networks everywhere. So you would be driving or whatever, you'd have 2 million cars every year go on the road with a Wi-Fi network.

You know, no matter where you are in the world, if you owned a Tesla or you had a Starlink account, you could then piggy back onto other people's. It would be extraordinary. Uh so anyway, uh we'll see what happens in that space. But other interesting things in the news?\nYeah.\nYeah, absolutely. Um, just a quick item for folks out there who are just tracking the markets before we dive into some startup and founder focused stuff. Jason, uh, Nvidia today reached for the first time of any company in history a 4 trillion market cap. And this made me think back in time to something that I wrote in July of 2017 that was entitled Tech's five biggest players are now worth $3 trillion. And I find it whimsical that at the time Nvidia wasn't even one of those top five companies and is now worth $4 trillion which of course is one-third more than all them were worth five eight years ago now. Wow. Yeah.\nWhich to my earlier point when you worry about competition in the space here we are. If I were to tell you 10 years ago to rank the top five companies by market cap, Nvidia wouldn't be in anybody's list. And here we are. It is the number one company by market cap. And AI\n\n\nis what's driving that.\nAnd obviously the hardware is such a key component of all this currently.\nAnd if we sit here 10 years from now, I can guarantee you Nvidia will not be the number one company.\nIt'll be somebody else will uh you know make their way onto that list or even be the largest.\nBut wow.\nUh incredible.\nUh and it was seemed like it was waning and people were thinking, \"Hm, maybe uh Nvidia had its peak,\" and now here we are.\nThe public markets are driven, I think, um in a major way by retail investors.\nAnd retail investors, um for certain stocks obviously, are driven by retail investors, and this is one of them.\nRetail investors really believe the AI story.\nThey really believe the Nvidia story, and I don't think they're wrong.\nI think the reason they believe it is because they use these products every day and they get so much value for them that they're remembering what happened, I don't know, 15 years ago when they started using Airbnb, Uber, and DoorDash, or they're remembering 30 years ago when they started using the internet at large, you know, or maybe for most people it was 25 years ago.\nThey're having that moment where they're like, \"Yeah, this is changing my life.\nI should place a bet.\"\nAnd AI is changing people's lives.\nI think we'll get into that with this Perplexity um and the DIA browser and the Comet browser uh when we go on to the next story.\nSo, just to put this into perspective for folks, Jason, this is a chart showing Nvidia's uh lifetime share price.\nAnd as you can tell, if you go back in time to the 2000s era, it's trading at effectively nothing because it's gone up so much.\nUm, and there you can see it reaching the $4 trillion number.\nWhat I wanted to point out though is that this is not a stock that's getting increasingly expensive in terms of its price-to-sales ratio or as we say in the startup game, it's revenue multiple.\nSo Jason, here's a chart showing Nvidia's price sales over time.\nThis is a shorter time frame.\nThis is just kind of like the midpoint of '22 through today.\nBut as you can see, the price sales ratio of Nvidia peaked actually in kind of mid-2023 and has since come down uh a pretty material percentage.\nSo not cheap for sure, but certainly not increasingly ludicrous as the company scales and as the company grows.\nSo that made me rest a little bit easier about this particular milestone.\nThere's not folks losing their mind.\nIt was trading at 40 times there.\nI think if uh you look at the chart, 40 times revenue, and then now it's at 37, I think, is that what I saw there?\n27.\n27, so 40 times 27 times, it's a big number, but it's still growing a massive amount year-over-year.\nWhat's the growth now year-over-year?\nSo in the current quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to turn in about $25.5 billion in revenue, and according to our calculations, that's a 51% growth rate.\nAnd then for the next quarter, they're expecting year-over-year here.\nYes, thank you, Jason.\nA year-over-year number, and then the year-over-year growth rate should slow according to analysts to 47% in the third quarter of this year.\nSo, it's slowing down, but I mean, its revenue base is so large.\nGrowing at 50% is staggering.\nMicrosoft grows at like 14%, 15%, and that's great for a company that large, but this is just still ludicrous growth.\nUh, pretty impressive.\nUh, let's keep going.\nAll right.\nSo, I found something that really kind of made my brain sit back and think.\nUh, one of my old friends is Jason Lipkin, uh, previously of Storm Ventures and so forth, and now he's kind of the SAS guy, if you will.\nAnd he said the following.\nThis really took me back.\nUh, there's a service called Granola.\nUh, Jason, I'm sure you've heard of it.\nIt's an AI note-taking and augmentation tool.\nAnd Jason Lumpin said, uh, \"Meet Granola has to be the first app I've seen where business pricing is cheaper than individuals.\"\nAnd I was kind of taken aback by that.\nSo I went ahead and took a look at their actual pricing page.\nAnd if you want to pay for the service, it's 18 bucks a month for an individual or 14 bucks a month for a business user.\nAnd I've never seen corporate customers get a discount compared to individuals.\nAnd I was just trying to figure out what's the thesis here.\nI've emailed the company asking, haven't heard back quite yet, but I wanted to put it to you because I don't think any founder that I know is doing this.\nAnd so I'm curious, is it smart?\nIs it a good play?\nAnd should it be adopted?\nSounds like they want to get the network effect going, and they believe their network effect inside of organizations is really strong.\nVis-a-vis, like they, what Granola does is it covertly, which is a little problematic, I think, but the the the horse has left the barn in this regard.\nIt kind of covertly records everything on your computer uh in terms of meetings.\nSo, if you're in a Zoom meeting, sometimes people add their AI assistant to it and takes notes and records and transcribes.\nGranola just does this uh at like a desktop route level on your Mac.\nSo, every meeting you do, every phone call, it's up to you to turn it off or to tell the other person.\nSo, I tried it.\nSome of the people uh in our investment company like to use it, and I think they have individual accounts that they signed up for.\nAnd I was like, \"Well, this is interesting.\nI wonder if as an organization we should record every single business conversation we have, put it into some internal giant LLM and be able to query it.\"\nYou have to then take that against the liability of having everything recorded.\nWhat if somebody says something on a call that's put aside, inappropriate, whatever that would be, the indiv, that's manageable in some ways.\nSomebody people do stupid things or misspeak sometimes.\nBut let's say somebody advises somebody on a legal issue.\nYou're in a law firm and you're using this and they give bad legal advice or outdated legal advice, and every call is recorded.\nNow it somebody goes back and uses a transcript.\nSo I, I got to think law firms are banning or setting on their Zooms, \"Don't record, don't summarize,\" but they're the people who would get the most value from it.\nSo this is going to become very interesting on a litigious basis, all of this stuff getting recorded everywhere and then people doing it covertly.\nBack to your original question, uh, they probably get three or four business users every time somebody signs up for a business account.\nSo, what they're doing here is they're pushing you towards the business account, seemingly losing $48 a year, four times 12 dollars less, but probably picking up two or three more users every time somebody signs up for a business account on average.\nSo they're purposely telling people, \"Don't sign up for the individual, sign up for the business.\"\nINBOUND 2025 is almost upon us, featuring a lineup of visionary leaders and personalities who are going to transform your entire approach to doing business.\nThere are lots of big names in this lineup, including Daario Emodi of the Breakout AI company and TWiST 500 member Anthropic.\nWe use Claude every day.\nThis company is making amazing strides, and you just know Dario has got some great insights to share at the event.\nSo that's going to be a awesome keynote, and this is how you level up as a founder by learning from the people who came before you and soaking up all that experience and just downloading all that wisdom.\nWe talk about this all the time.\nThere's no substitute for being in person.\nThe era of work from home and from remote hiding in your bedroom, that's over.\nIt's time to get back out there.\nSo, if you want to connect with visionary leaders and personalities like Daario, Victor Riparbelli, Darmmes Shaw, my friend, and more, you have a chance at INBOUND 2025.\nThat's right, the epicenter of tech innovation is happening this year from September 3rd to 5th in San Francisco, California.\nUse the code twist 10 at checkout to get 10% off general mission tickets at inbound.com/register.\nThat's inbound.com/register.\nAnd they also have an enterprise plan for folks who are curious that does cost more than either.\nBut Jason, uh, a replicable idea if you have a service that can be purchased by individuals but might have application at the company customer level.\nYeah.\nI mean, or they could just have an account and it's uh Yeah.\nI wonder if that's an interesting.\nYou just sign up for an account with your email, and if you use your business email, it, it, you know, it automatically does the thing where it connects you to other people at, you know, companyame.com.\nSure, why not?\nIf you think you have a way to get the viral loop going, give people a deal to get them into the business thing.\nI think what they're doing here too is they've created business and then they still have enterprise, which costs 35.\nSo maybe this is they know business gets that viral loop going, but that eventually two out of three people wind up going to enterprise, which is $35 per user per month.\nAnd that uh lets you opt out of model training for everyone in your team uh and admin controls for meeting link sharing.\nUm, and so that's probably what people have to do.\nSo remember where I was just talking about the liability associated with this.\nWhat if you start having meetings about legal issues and you're training their data and then somebody else has the legal advice in their meeting comes up or something?\nI mean, this could get really gnarly.\nThis, this, the core of business is conversations that occur, and you know, the the value of recording them is obvious.\nYou don't forget stuff.\nYou have notes.\nWe're gonna see in a year from now, we can set a timer.\nIn a year from now, we're going to start seeing the lawsuits and we're going to start seeing Zoom, Granola getting subpoenas for meetings that occurred.\nUm, and soon your desktop is obviously going to be recorded and your browser is going to be recorded, which links into this next story.\nI saw Perplexity launched Comet, their browser.\nI know there's another browser called DIA.\nThese are all with the idea that you can do two main functions.\nOne is agentic behaviors like, \"Go do some task for me.\"\nThe second is uh being able to run a large language model against your previous browser windows or the ones you have open.\nSo imagine you open 10 blog posts and then start asking questions against them.\nBut I thought we would do a little demo here on these, and maybe you could just fill in any blanks I left out here.\nNo, I think it's a great summary.\nSo, Perplexity, of course, is the well-known AI search engine.\nIt's gotten up to 780 million queries per month as of May, Jason.\nAnd they've been teasing this Comet browser for some time now.\nIt is gated, so if you don't have a Perplexity Max subscription, which runs you about 200 bucks a month, you're probably going to be on the wait list like myself.\nUh, so I had didn't get a chance to play with it, but Jason, I did go through and pull up DIA for us and have a little demo of what it can do.\nBut I think we'll start with Comet because that's the fresh news today, and then we'll do a little side-by-side.\nYeah.\nSo I, I actually just went and paid for the $200 thing just for the audience here to see it at work.\nUh, and so let me share my screen here.\nThat's a business model for you.\nLaunch a higher price tier, then drop your coolest thing and put it right behind that gate.\nAnd you know what?\n10 points, it works.\nSomebody.\nWell, I mean, if you think about it, like the, if it, if this doesn't provide enough value, which I don't think it does at, you know, after an hour, half an hour, an hour of using it, I don't think this provides enough value for $2,000 or $2,400 a year.\nBut at 50 bucks a month, I probably would sign up for it.\nSo, somewhere between those two numbers is reality for me.\nBut maybe I'll find other things.\nSo, here I said, \"I'm looking for flights to San Francisco on United for Monday morning.\"\nThen I want to fly to New York City from San Francisco, yada yada.\nAnd you see it starts doing things uh and it says, \"Let me know if you want to and and you know what I want to do here.\"\nAnd I said, \"Yeah, go ahead and book the direct United flight uh here from San Francisco to New York Friday morning.\"\nAnd it gives me the options.\nAnd I said, um, would like to book business class at 9:20 a.m. flight.\nAnd sure enough, in the other browser window, let's see if I can get to it here.\nGot to get this out of the way.\nOkay.\nUm, it went and it put it into, and I happened to be logged in to United at the time, and it put it into my checkout, the literal flight that I wanted to, and all I have to do is go to the next step and uh, close the transaction.\nAnd it tells me in that transaction, uh, would you like, uh, it says here, uh, [Music] hold on.\nOkay.\nThe reservation process is complete up to the payment step, and you can finalize by entering your payment details on United's website.\nGives me a one and a two, and I can just click that and boom, it opens up the browser window, and it was doing that in the back round.\nThat's awesome.\nWhich is pretty crazy.\nUm, and uh, I guess it has related here.\nI could add lounge access for the business class flight.\nAnd I, I, it what it does is you'll see here when it does this, it goes to the United, um, and it says, \"Find and add United Club access.\"\nSee that little window there?\nThat's the page.\nAnd you can see it steps, and you see it moving around on the page doing stuff.\nSo that's almost like a like a browser container, if you will, Jason, that's doing things, and you have like a keyhole vision into it.\nYeah.\nIt's like I'm watching it do the work.\nSo here you can see uh it's revive a revision panel's open.\nLet me click change flight selection.\nI see we're now on the flight search page.\nPerfect.\nI can now see the flight search results.\nI can see flight UA435 departing at 9:20 a.m. and the price.\nAnd it's just reasoning, and it's doing it.\nNow this is uh what I've always wanted.\nThis is what I want chat GPT, Grok, and everybody to do.\nAnd so I think that this concept is going to be the winning concept.\nYou were playing with DIA and doing some uh and DIA is by the browser company.\nDIA is by the browser company.\nAnd what stru\n\n\nOkay, let me see. I'm looking at comments and looking at DIA this morning, Jason, is that they share in some ways a bit of UI. So what I have coming up here on screen is a screenshot we put together. This on the right is Dia, and then on the left, this is a screen capture from the Perplexity Comet video. But what you'll notice on both of these, and we'll tidy it up and post it a little bit clearer, is that they had these right rails, these assistants. And so what they've done is introduce a brand new UI element into the browsing experience that takes up a good chunk of your screen, but it can do quite a lot as you just showed. But you don't always have to be exactly on the Perplexity website to do stuff. You can actually interact with your browser inside of Comet just from the right rail. And I thought I'd show you an example of how this works in Dia's case. So what I have here, and I'll just pull this up, is the Dia browser, and what I have over here, Jason, is my right rail, and you can ask it questions. Now, the difference between Comet and Dia is that Dia is not agentic. So it can't go into this CNBC website, for example, and click around for me. But what it can do is see it and reason. So I can ask it, like, what's the most important headline on this page, and it's going to think for a little bit using its own LLM and then say, \"Okay, the most important thing is, it thinks, Linda Yaccarino stepping down,\" which is interesting because earlier it said that the most important story was actually Nvidia's $4 trillion market cap moment. But this is what it looks like. It's slick. It's quick. It's pretty good, but I do feel like what Comet has put together goes a little bit further, frankly.\n\nThe Vibe coding revolution is here. The days of needing a giant team of developers to build your mobile app, those are over. With Bolt, anyone can build web applications quickly and without knowing how to code. You just need to speak English. And I think, hey, if you're hearing my voice right now, you just might be able to speak English. Getting started is as easy as visiting bolt.new and just telling their AI-powered system what you want to start building in plain, simple language. You can use bolt.new to design a stunning new landing page for your company. You could upgrade your CRM. You could build a consumer-facing mobile app and more. In fact, one of our launch founders, one of my favorite, Craig Zingerline, he used Bolt to create a surprisingly powerful email marketing analytics tool, Life Cycle Lift. By entering a few key metrics, his system projects a newsletter's revenue potential. Your competitors are already using cutting-edge tools to ship their products faster than ever, so don't be left behind. Try bolt.new/twist to try it for free. That's bolt.new/twist and show me what you built.\n\nYeah, absolutely. And yeah, this is really interesting, this concept of the sidebar. And so I just did a really interesting thing. I went to the Drudge Report and let me show you this working. This is kind of interesting. Um, let me see if you can see this. I said, \"Please open the top 20 links on this page and summarize them.\" And it's going up and down the Drudge Report, opening each page, CNBC page, you know, going to each page, summarizing the page, going back, and then loading the next page. That's really interesting if you think about it as a concept if you were on, see, we just went back to Drudge Report. Yeah. And then it's going, now it's back to the CNBC story about Linda Yaccarino. So you could go to an aggregator like Drudge or Techme. You can go to the New York Times. I could go to the New York Times and say, summarize, do a search for Nicks and summarize every Nick story in the history of the New York Times. And I don't think the New York Times would understand this as a bot because I'm logged in and it, you know, is my browser. It's not like a screen scraper. But this is what is happening. By the way, when you work at a large language model company, they are going and figuring out all kinds of bots to do this kind of stuff in real time and how to get past paywalls, etc. Uh, so that's really fascinating. And by the way, still doing it. So, and if all of this, um, I wonder if all of this is then put into like a central repository for me for all time. Those are the kind of features that I really want. And this gets pretty expensive. There's a reason why this is $200 a month. What I just did is probably going to cost them actual money, especially if they're saving all this data into a large language model in a context window somewhere. I'm not sure what happens with all this information, but um, I could see this becoming a very interesting product.\n\nOh yeah, for sure. By the way, just because I was curious how Dia would handle a similar task, and I pulled out the New York Times and I just said, \"Summarize the top five stories for me,\" and instantly just took care of it. So, I really do think we're bringing AI more and more into our actual workspaces, which is great because no one wants it to be just in Slack following you around, telling you to do your to-dos. That's just having another parent, which I don't think anyone really wants. Uh, last company in this list though, Island. Uh, we've talked to them on the show. Island's building an enterprise secure browser. A pretty different approach to this, but just goes to show that there's a lot of companies right now experimenting in the browser space, and we're all waiting to see if the rumors and reports about Open AI doing their own browser are true. Uh, probably in some capacity, but it may end up like the Apple car, just stuck on someone's computer somewhere, never making it out to the world. Uh, yeah, let's keep going.\n\nAll right. Uh, one thing that I'm pretty excited about is Waymo and Tesla are expanding their geographic footprints. Now, we've talked about the robo taxi launch from Tesla quite a lot. As everyone recalls, it was in a geo-fenced area inside of Austin. Invited a lot of Tesla influencers and fans. People were taking dozens and dozens of rides, mostly pretty good reviews. Couple of things we saw on social media. Uh, but people are now reporting that are watching Tesla's fleets in and around the Austin area that they are doing LAR mapping and prep to expand the geo-fence, possibly including the downtown Austin area. So to me, Jason, from just where I sit, that's pretty quick, and I think implies confidence in progress thus far and implies that, you know, at least in the Texas area, Tesla's robo taxis are going to become an actual competitor to not just Waymo, but also Uber, uh, fast ways to go, um, is what I would say. I have the, um, and slow and steady wins the race would be the other thing I would say. I have hardware four, uh, which I believe is what's on the robo taxis. That's what Elon said. It's the same software stack. It's the same hardware. I would think the software is a little bit tweaked, but let's just assume it is as he's explained it. Uh, I think there's enough interventions that they need that safety driver. I think putting the safety driver in the passenger seat versus the driver's seat is performative. It doesn't really matter. I get why they're doing it. I think they should just put the safety driver in for one year in every city. That should become the new standard. And then after 10,000 rides, 1 million miles with safety drivers without an instance or without a major instance, whatever we want to benchmark it, then anybody, whether it's Volkswagen, Zuks, Waymo, everybody should just have the same standard, X number of rides, X number of miles per city. Because I can tell you, you know, I've been using hardware 4 for a while now. I'll have a perfect trip and then there'll be construction. There'll be some weird unknown. And so when I ride on the 290, as an example, uh, or on 290, we don't put the \"the\" in Austin. So like in Los Angeles, you say the 405, the 10 freeway. Here, you just say I took one to 290. And you have to stop. You don't say the one to the 290. You have to just say 2901. Or else they know you're from out of town. Anyway, um, nobody's really on the high-speed roads yet. I think for a reason. Mistakes at low speed are manageable. So, when we saw, you know, there were maybe a dozen instances where people thought the Teslas could have done better. One or two of them were a little bit severe, like there was a little uh, touchy touchy of a down an alleyway, but it was at low speed where like the Tesla bumped in its tire, touched another car. Okay, that's car-on-car contact, but it was at like zero miles per hour, like 1 mile per hour. So, you're while people will be like, \"Oh, that's not good.\" It's not like, \"Oh, somebody got hurt or there was property damage.\" Yes. Uh, and then just today we were having breakfast over here on South Congress. There was um, the Volkswagen uh, cars running everywhere, the the ID Buzz. So that's going to have a safety driver in it. I do think these are going to expand slowly, and they are going to greatly expand the number of ride-sharing rides. I've said this over and over again. Yeah, this really isn't like humans versus um, automated cars. I think this is car ownership versus going full Uber, full uh, ride share, full ride share. And uh, all of these are going to really help. Some people don't want to be in a Waymo. Some people only want to be in a Waymo. Tipping is uh, really nice to not have to tip. Not having to talk to somebody is really nice for some people. Other people really want to have somebody there they can talk to or who can help them with their bags. So, uh, it's going to be a slow, steady rollout. Be careful out there, folks. No shame in the safety driver game.\n\nNo, not at all. And on the people really want to take a robo taxi or not point, Jason. Um, we're seeing, I think, a pretty good cultural shift towards taking them. Uh, Waymo just announced it's going to roll out teen accounts in the Phoenix metro area. So, if you have a child between 14 and 17, underneath the 18 kind of theoretical threshold for ridership, now parents can have teen accounts and send their kids out and about, which is incredible because teen accounts for which one? For which service? Waymo? Waymo is going to have teen accounts. Okay. Yeah, 'cause I was about to say Uber has teen accounts already. So, Oh, did I say Uber? No, I wasn't sure. Oh. Oh, sorry. No, I may have misspoke. Waymo. Sorry. Waymo is going to have teen accounts in the areas where they're not going through Uber's app, which they're doing in Atlanta and in um, Austin. So, I guess this is Phoenix. Yeah. Okay. Well, but this is what you want because if you have kids, the reason they have teen accounts is I think Uber's teen accounts records the rides. I don't know if you've gotten into cars where it says recording the audio for safety of the participants. That when I was in Grab, I think everything was recorded and they give you a note, you're being recorded. So, back to everything's recorded. Uh, be careful out there. Do not assume that you're, I would assume if you're in a Waymo or any robo taxi, you're being recorded. And uh, if you're being recorded, that means it could be transcribed. If it's transcribed, that means it could be abused. As we saw with God Mode and Uber in the early days, people were like, \"Oh, this could be abused.\" And you could actually watch people, you know, in the San Francisco launch, there was like, \"Oh, can I see this journalist and where they're going and are they going on a booty call at 2 a.m. or did they stay out in the club till 4:00 a.m.?\" In God Mode, you would see the passengers and they had to abstract and take away the names of people and put hashes in. All that stuff can get uh, abused. It's easy enough to fix, but in any system, I can tell you there will be bad actors who will abuse a system. All right. Anything else major in the news? Or maybe we'll talk to our guest.\n\nUh, well, let's do something briefly before we talk to our guest. Uh, I just want to point out that we have discussed private stock trades quite a lot on the show in the last couple of months. Uh, there was a service called Link, L I N QTO. Uh, it just filed for bankruptcy protection and it's under SEC investigation, and there's quite a lot of controversy about did the people who tried to use it to purchase shares actually get them? Uh, maybe not. There's a lot of stuff going through this. There's court filings. It's a lot of details, but essentially 13,000 people use the platform. They bought about a half billion dollars worth of stock at fair market value, and now they're trying to sort out who owns what, what the actual assets are. And so, caveat emptor, I think, is the uh, the gist here. We've talked a lot about secondaries. They're important. Just if you're going to take part in this, understand what you're buying. Go into the details. For example, the tokenized offerings from Robinhood are super cool and a really interesting innovation, but they are not a traditional equity purchase. Just keep that in mind, folks. Just be safe out there while we talk about this. So, you know, when you have the SPV space specifically and people selling shares in private companies through special um, um, purpose vehicles, thank you. Uh, special purpose vehicles and these kind of things. You might be with a fly-by-night person who says they have access to SpaceX shares or to Open AI shares and they don't, and they don't actually own them, and you bought into it. How do you know? You would have to then have the company tell you, well, these companies have, you know, hundreds of millions of shares, billions of shares. They may not be tracking all these this SPV activity. And so, this is why the public markets are so regulated because you don't want people to be uh, swindled out of their money.\n\n\nIf you do partake in the secondary markets and these things, you have to do it with a reputable person who has something to lose. I have no idea who Link Q is. I have never heard of Link 2. Um, and I don't know like what happened here. But if you haven't heard of the site, now if you go talk about Robinhood is a 90, whatever it is, a 50 billion, hundred billion dollar company, uh, with I don't know how many tens of billions of dollars under management, whatever it is, you can be sure that they went through the highest legal review and have a lot of insurance and executives and a board that will all be uh, liable. Now, does that mean an Enron can't happen? That's another company that was public, and I'm saying Robinhood's Enron, but you, we have seen companies like Enron. People could be doing totally shady stuff inside of a publicly traded company. It can happen. It's incredibly rare in private companies. It's not incredibly rare. It's incredibly common. So, understand, like, there are two very different things at work here. I, I mean, the number of times we found accounting fraud at a public company, they're so notable because usually there's somebody like Price Waterhouse Coopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG, there's some accounting firm that was responsible, and you have to ask, well, what happened, where did the breakdown occur, and you know, you can trick your auditors too, that is completely possible, or you could have a bad actor at your auditors, that has happened as well. WorldCom, or people can just make really weird marginal decisions about recognizing revenue. Private companies is the wild west. You have to be extremely careful. Only investment you can afford to lose, and uh, yeah, be careful. Now, with, explain to me what's happening with these tokens you're buying on Robinhood because I am not up on it. So, how, how does it work? So, Robinhood made a big announcement that they are going to tokenize US equities and US ETFs, essentially put them on the blockchain, tokenization, and offer them to European investors. So, if you're in Europe and you didn't have access to the US stock market and want to have exposure, you can purchase these tokens. Now, according to Robinhood, um, these stock tokens are quote financial derivative contracts between you and Robinhood referencing certain stocks. Now that is the language from the OpenAI stock that they were using as a promotional material, but the mechanism is the same. You are essentially buying uh, exposure to an asset with Robinhood as the intermediary. Some people call it Jason are kind of likening these to equity swaps, if you will. That's a lot of backend abstraction, but you're not always buying the core asset.\nYeah. So, if you're buying OpenAI tokens, those tokens are backed by some OpenAI equity somewhere, or they're just a way to play the valuation of OpenAI, I guess. And if you sell them, you sell your shares in OpenAI. Who's on the other side of that trade? I mean, that's what I'm trying to figure out.\nYeah. So, here's uh, here's how Vlad explained it. After OpenAI was like, \"Hey, you can't give away equity in us. You don't have equity in us. What are you talking about?\" So, Vlad said, \"At our recent crypto event, we announced a limited stock token giveaway.\" Uh, while it is true that these are not technically quote equity, uh, what they do is give retail investors exposure to these private assets. And so, I think the way this works is Vlad Robinhood, uh, got some allocation of equity in these two companies, probably via an SPV, uh, but you can't probably take an individual share from that and give it to somebody, especially these small increments. So, I think they're holding the equity. They're offering essentially people a $5 to $10 token coupon for those two firms, and then if the underlying assets appreciate, that'll be reflected in the token price. It's complicated because they're not public, and we're trying so hard to make private companies public companies. So, I was going to drag people through a lot of stuff about secondary interest and why this is happening now, but Jason, do we need a third category? Because I feel like startups and public companies are now not enough.\nThere's not enough nuance to those two categories to have people happy.\nYeah. I, I mean, consumers want to trade in private companies because they're smart, and these companies stay private a long time, and they're well aware of them. They don't have access to them. Um, a way to do it that would be interesting, perhaps, is to have these SPVs be sanctioned, and in some cases they are, um, and regulated a little bit, and maybe they have to prove they have the equities behind them. So, you know, it does seem like education, making sure the consumers understand what they're buying, and then having the companies be able to approve secondary sales for certain groups of people and say, \"Hey, these 20 different platforms have access to these shares, and they sell them quarterly,\" and so some way of buying into them. But when people own these shares and then they go public, like there's that public company Destiny 100 or something that has some SpaceX shares in it.\nYou know, people are so desperate to have exposure to SpaceX that they'll buy that Destiny 100, which has, I don't know what small percentage, 10 or 20% of the fund itself is SpaceX, but they're willing to pay 52%.\nOh, is it 52%? Well, maybe that's 52%. Yeah.\nYeah. It's probably because the value of SpaceX keeps going up. So, it might have been like when it was a hundred billion dollar company as opposed to a $400 billion company, that would only have been 12 a.5% of its uh, total equity or something, or 15%. So, anyway, um, yeah, it's a, it's a, it's challenging, but what it does show is, I think consumers know a winner earlier than the companies go public, and so they want to get in on winners earlier, and they don't have access to it. So, the uh, what is it? Nature finds a way. Nature is finding a way. Life finds a way. Life finds a way to make this investment. People want to make this investment. They're going to figure out a way to get their hands on those shares.\nYeah. Nvidia went public, by the way. I just pulled it up at a valuation back in 1999 of about $1.5 billion. So, there's a data point about how it used to be.\nUh, now I think this is a great time to talk to our guest, Jason. Financial literacy is super duper important, especially if you're getting into the exotics. Uh, but for folks out there who are just students, uh, well, they should probably know how to work their finances in the day-to-day basis. Checking accounts, savings accounts, how to invest, how to handle credit. And that's where Tim Ranzetta and the other folks at Next Gen Personal Finance are hard at work, beavering away to bring comprehensive financial education to all students, hopefully by 2030 in the United States at the high school level. Tim, hey, how you doing?\nHey, it's great to be here. Fascinating conversation you all were having earlier. Well, we're, we're, yeah, this is, um, I guess, you know, not, um, unrelated, but maybe you could tell people what NGPF is. If you want to go see the website, it's ngpf.org.\nCorrect.\nCorrect.\nAnd so what did you create? Why did you create it? How's it going?\nYeah, it all started about 13 years ago. Uh, I volunteered to teach a course in personal finance at a high school in East Palo Alto called Eastside College Prep. And number one, looked to see what was out there, cuz I had committed to something I really wasn't ready for, which was 25 hours of curriculum taught to three sections of students. Um, and so number one, I saw a gap just in terms of a course that I wanted to teach that I thought would engage young people. So, clearly there was a need out there. Secondly, I just saw the engagement level of the students. Every student wanted to learn this. They were so excited about it. Guess what? They went home to talk to their parents. Like teenagers going home to talk to parents. I was getting emails from parents saying, \"I want to start investing because my son David came home and was talking about it.\"\nI mean, that's hilarious because most of the time you ask your kids, \"How was school today? What happened at school today?\" And they're like, \"Fine, nothing.\" To actually have the kids come home and say, \"This topic was so engaging. I want to talk to my parents about it is huge. Continue, please.\"\nYeah. So, that was, I taught for eight years, uh, in the summers, and it was about three years into that experience, I said, I'm enough is enough. I got tired of reading about how financially illiterate we are as a nation when I thought the solution was found in every public high school in America. And so that was kind of the genesis of starting Next Gen Personal Finance. The, it's a nonprofit. We give everything away for free. Uh, so there is no revenue model. I want to get this into every high school in America. And the minute you put up a paywall, you're going to limit access. And I was fortunate as an entrepreneur to be able to fund our operation for the better part of a decade. But we started with lessons. We started with curriculum. We built out games. And then we quickly realized the reason this isn't being taught is nobody feels confident teaching the subject. We have to train teachers. And so 11 years later, we've trained almost 20,000 teachers who've spent over half a million hours learning about investing, learning about credit. And so what you discover is this course doesn't only impact the students, it doesn't only impact the parents, it impacts the teachers. I think that's some of the most gratifying feedback we get from teachers. I now understand my 403b plans. I understand how to invest. I understand how to manage my credit better. Okay. So, we have the curriculum, we have the professional development. What we don't have is, we don't have requirements. We don't have a guaranteed course in high school curriculum. And so at that point, we set up, uh, we had to set up a new organization because nonprofits can't lobby. Um, so we went out and created this organization NGPF mission 2030 fund. And I'm happy to say in the last four years, we've had 20 states pass laws that guarantee a high school student will take a course in personal finance. And you'll be happy to hear this. Texas was one of the latest earlier this year. And so then this is going to surprise a lot of people to hear. There are 30 states, 29 soon to be 30 states that currently guarantee this course. That represents 76% of high school students in America. So, we can no longer say this isn't being taught in schools cuz it is. And now really the hard work begins. And so the fourth aspect of our business is really partnering with school districts and partnering with state partners to say, let us help you implement this new course because ultimately it's not about legislation, it's about implementation and making sure this is done well.\nSo now that teachers have the materials and there is a push for this to be included at the high school level, do you have any notes on the impact it's having on students apart from the really lovely anecdotes? Are we seeing changes in credit card applications or people being a bit more conservative with savings and so forth? Because this is a topic very near and dear to my heart, Tim.\nYeah, I think it's early days in terms of, well, let me talk about the research that has been done to date, and it basically shows higher credit scores, and so we had a consulting firm model it out, and they estimated the lifetime value of this course is $100,000. And a lot of that comes from higher credit scores because you don't come out of the womb understanding how credit works. And so that's one of those things where if you make early mistakes, it's really hard to dig out of that hole. Um, we also see better decisions about uh, borrowing. So, no more payday lending. They're finding lower cost ways to borrow if they need to borrow. We're seeing better decisions when it comes to financing college education because that's, you know, coming out of high school. That's probably the biggest decision facing them is whether they're going to go to a four-year college, a two-year college, or go to trade schools, or what their path looks like. So, there's, there's research out there already that shows that it works. I think it's only going to get better. And the cool thing is, we'll start to see it in national statistics because when 3/4 of kids are getting this, now granted it's 30% today, it's going to 76% as these states implement over time. And so, like you see stats already, right, that young people are starting to invest at younger ages. And now part of that is commission free trading. Part of this, part of that is the platforms which make it really simple, and the cost of entry of investing has really gone down to a dollar in many instances. And so you're seeing more, but I just, I feel a lot more confident they're going to be making better decisions about investing.\nAnd the great irony or paradox here is, if we don't teach kids about finance and they make poor financial decisions, then they believe capitalism and capitalism plus democracy is some sort of rigged game that they don't get to participate in, that they are victims, and what happens, mandami or whatever his name is in New York, and you know, socialism sounds like a really good idea, maybe the state, I should be a ward of the state, and they'll take care of me, and they'll do a better job because I was told I should spend 250k on my degree, and then I'll get a 50k job, and but mathematically that makes no sense, and your course literally has in it paying for college, how to afford college and career, and how to earn money. There seems like there were two or three generations that were sold, um, a false bill of goods. Is there any way to save that generation in your mind to re-educate them?\nSo, you're talking about millennials.\nI think it's millennials and maybe right after them who literally went 100k, 200k into debt. Alex might be one of them.\nAnd\noh, no, nothing like that.\nNothing like that. But people went into serious debt. The price of a college education ballooned and salary stayed the same or went up modestly and just didn't keep up. So, what, what do you think happens to that lost generation there? Yeah, I think the hope is they transmit those lessons to the next generation. Kind of, cuz when you've, when you've gone through that, so we did, uh, one of the states, uh, California, um, the legislature passed a law last year, and the only way that happened was we were moving forward with a ballot\n\n\nInitiative, and so we had\ncollected 890,000 signatures, and so at\nthat point it became obvious to the\nlegislators that this was going to pass\none way or the other. But we, as part of\nthat process for the initiative, we did\nfocus groups, and you know, where you sit\nbehind the panel and you, you know, you\nhave this trained facilitator asking\npeople, adults, kind of about this issue.\nAnd and basically the facilitator said,\n\"We'd never seen this before. 24 out of 24\npeople thought this was a good idea.\" And\nyet, I will tell you, the emotion that I\nfelt, and this is to your point, Jason, was\nregret.\nIt got there sooner, yeah.\nIt was regret and hope\nbecause several of them said, \"We didn't\nget it. But certainly the next generation\nshould.\" And so that was\nTim, do you need to have a second program\nthat is education for people 28 to 40 to\ngrab Jason's timeline there, just to\noffer them the same? Is there a way to\nreach out to people that are not just\nhigh school students? Because I think\nwhat you're doing is super critical and\namazing, but also I don't want to let\nthose other people just suffer and die\nwith 30% APRs.\nI think what we're seeing is a couple\ndifferent things. Uh, well, number one, you\nknow, I'm all about focus. We got to keep\nour eye on the ball. Yes. Yes.\nThe good news is our curriculum is used\nfor adults, too. And so, we see a lot of\nnonprofit organizations working with\nexactly that cohort of people you're\ntalking about. I think the other\ninteresting phenomena is you're starting\nto see companies offer this as a service\nbecause they look at the statistics and\nsay, \"My young employees are worried\nabout money all of the time,\" which\nmeans they're not thinking as much about\nthe work that they're doing. So you're\nstarting to see more companies kind of\nbring this inhouse as a service to young\npeople to say, \"Hey, this is available\nto you. You, you didn't get this. We know\nyou didn't get this in schools. Now we\ncan let's give this to you now.\" Now,\nthe key to the whole thing is I think\npeople often think, \"Oh, just send them\nto an online course, right?\" And I think\nthe magic, having taught the class and\nhaving worked with, you know, there's\n120,000 teachers who use our curriculum,\nthe magic is what happens in the\nclassroom. The magic is the\nconversation. The magic is the group\nprojects that really stick with you when\nyou're trying to figure out how to\nbudget with roommates. Like that's a fun\nexercise, one you won't forget and one\nthat's going to come into that's going\nto be handy at a young age. Um, so I\nthink that's the one cautionary tale\nhere is often times people think, \"Oh, I\ncan just create a course. If I build it,\nthey will come.\" I think it's a lot more\neffective when it's done with a teacher.\nThe only thing I I wonder about is\ngambling and and wagering and poker and\nstuff like that. We got uh poly market.\nYou got people who are doing prediction\nmarkets. It's a little polarizing that,\nyou know, teaching your kids to gamble\nat a young age. I like the idea of doing\nthat because life's full of gambles. You\nyou might as well learn early on that\nthis exists in the world so you don't\nget like suckered into it later, the\ncasino, whatever. Um, where does like\npoker and poly market and other things,\nyou know, intelligent wagering or um,\ndid and game theory because it's all\nkind of related? Yeah.\nYeah. So actually, we um, we hear from a\nlot of teachers about what kids are\ntalking about in the classroom, and then\nwe try and create curriculum around it.\nGambling was something we heard. You\nknow, 38 states now allow online sports\ngambling on on the phone, and\nunfortunately, many times they don't know\nthe age of the person on the other side.\nAnd so teachers were telling us, \"Hey,\nthis is a problem. We're hearing about\nkids running into issues.\" And so, while\nI agree with you, we ought to teach\nresponsible gambling. It's unfortunate,\nparticularly for young minds, typically\nmales. Um, high high percentage of them\nrun into problems. And so let's kind of\nlet's not pretend it's not there. Let's\nhave a conversation about it. And so\nabsolutely, that's that was one of our\nmost popular product launches. It's a\nminiunit. Um, so if you go up to the\ncurriculum under curriculum\num, and go to the very bottom, miniunits,\nyou'll see\ngambling.\nYeah. I was just trying to point out\nthat you had stuff about cognitive\nbiases and so forth already in there,\nbut this is even better. Love it. Yeah,\npsychology is really psychology is\nreally important. We that's our first\nunit, cuz we got to talk about we have to\ntalk about our own relationship to money\nbecause we all know the household we\ngrew up in\nand the attitudes and mindsets that\nwe're hearing about from our community,\nfrom our neighborhood, from our friends,\nlike that impacts the way we think about\nmoney. Let's make sure we kind of start\nthe course using that as a way for\nteachers also to create a the trust in\nthe classroom that students feel\ncomfortable talking about what they know\nand what they don't know. Yeah. And\nwhat's what what's interesting is\ngambling has gotten so popular that many,\nI I think I saw a survey somewhere, this\nwas kind of 18 to 24 year olds. A\nquarter of them think of gambling as an\ninvestment.\nSo they don't think of investing as a\ngamble. They think of gambling as an\ninvestment,\nwhich I I get it. They think they have\nan edge or something. Here's what I\nwould tell a young person. If you really\nlove doing sports betting, it's your\npassion, whatever. For every dollar you\nput into that, put a dollar into QQQ,\nand just guarantee me you won't touch it\nfor 20 years. That's it. Guarantee me\nyou won't touch it for 20 years. Oh my\nlord, you will be delighted 20 years\nfrom now when you Oh, by the way, I I\njust wanted to tell you about this, Tim.\nThere's a thing called FIRE on Reddit.\nUm, Alex will pull it up here. There's a\nsubreddit.\nFinancial independence, retire early.\nYou know it. Perfect. Okay.\nOh, it's huge movement.\nHuge movement. And I just want to let\nall the folks who work for me, uh, all\nthe young folks who listen to the show,\nthere there is a group of people, it\nmight only be .1% of young people right\nnow, but they're kind of the opposite of\nthe socialist movement. And you listen,\nI'm I'm going to keep bringing up mom\nDonnie because he's popular right now um\nwith a lot of young people for the I\nthink the wrong reasons, but I\nunderstand why. But just go look at the\npeople in FIRE. Financial independence,\nretire early. They have agency over\ntheir lives and they've defined what\nthey want their life to look like 10,\n20, 30 years from now and they are in\ncontrol of it.\nCoastfire 2. What is coastfire? They get\nto explain.\nWhen you when you want to basically\nokay,\nyou want to retire at 60, but then you\nwant to have enough money in your pool\nof money that you at 60 can guarantee a\n4% return.\nPerfect. Okay. Yeah. So, Coastfire,\nthank you, producer Sergio. I guess he's\nAre you doing this, Producer Sergio?\nPerfect. You're trying to Okay, great.\nYou work for me, so it's going to work\nout for you, I think. Coastfire, like\nyou get to a certain amount and then you\ncan take 4% out. Is that the number,\nTim? 4%.\nSo, when you hit 60 and you retire, I\nthink the number now is 4%. Some people\nsay five if you want to be fat fire or\nwhatever it is you want to live large.\nUm, that you can take from your\nprincipal and then it theoretically gets\nreplaced. And they've run, it's so\namazing, they run simulations to look at\nthe stock market and in the worst\npossible year when the stock market\ncrashed, like if you happen to retire in\nthe crash, what would happen? And it\nalways works out. It seems to always\nwork out for the retiree. Um, so just\nhave agency, folks. You're not victims.\nYou just haven't been enlightened yet\nuh, to exactly how in control you are. Go\nto ngpf.org,\nNext Gen Personal Finance, and support\nthis. Do you guys take donations? Do you\num, do stuff like that? Yeah. Okay,\ngreat. Somewhere on the\nwebsiters. Yeah, we're fortunate. Um,\nwe've had some great supporters\nincluding the Michael Jordan Foundation,\nuh, Bill Gurley actually. Oh.\nUm, as well as some others in the\nventure community who, um, yeah, who\nbelieve in our mission and kind of see\nthe results that we've been able to\nachieve.\nIncredible. Incredible. So, everybody go\nthere. If you got a little bit extra\nchatter, go ahead and donate. I'm going\nto go donate after I get off of here and\nwe'll talk to you soon. Tim, thanks so\nmuch for coming on the show.\nAwesome. Cheers.\nThanks for having me.\nAwesome. Good times.\nAppreciate it.\nAll right. I think that's enough show\nfor today. Alex, we did our job. We\nspread a little bit. Yeah, we got the\nnews out there. We got some good\nproducts for people and uh, some\ninspiration there at the end. Go ahead\nand support what he's doing over there.\nIt's it's really great work. Yeah.\nYeah, absolutely. My first actual job,\nJason, uh, was as intern at a consumer\nfinance magazine aimed at uh, youths.\nThat was my first job. I was a video\npodcast intern.\nUh, so I have a I have a deep and abiding\nlove for personal finance and helping\npeople not have no money because that\ndrives me nuts when they're broke. So\nbig big big big big fan.\nOkay. Uh, and we will see you all next\ntime on This Week in Startups. Bye-bye.\n",
