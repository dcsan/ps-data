All right, everybody. Welcome back to This Week in Startups. I'm Jay Cow. He's Alex. Tons of news going on in big tech, tons of startup news. We'll try to thread the needle, get between those two things. What do we got today in the news? What's the top? Give me the top two or three stories as you see them uh here on uh Friday, June 20th. As you can see, if you're watching the YouTube channel, uh or Spotify, I guess that's video, too. I am in Los Angeles. My road trip continues. How many airline miles do you have, Jason? Is it like 20 billion at this point in time? You know, it's very simple. I uh I all the when you own a company, all the miles collect to you 'cause you book all the tickets, right? So, anybody who travels business for our company, you know, we centrally consolidate all those, and then we get to use them. Um, you know, I always find that airline thing was a bit of a scam. When I was on the other side of it and I was an employee, I was like, \"Yeah, give me the miles.\" And I was like, \"Wait a second, this is incredible. They for for business they bribe the employees to buy higher level tickets to get more points, and then it's working against the best interest of the company.\" It was very funny. Um, I I have spent too many cycles. I try not to do this, but too many cycles trying to figure out how their systems work, and I realize, \"Oh, it's a video game. Miles, lounges, it's all a video game.\" Either you can play that game, and it takes up hours of your life, or I can read one more ad on a podcast or do 10 minutes of a speaking gig and make double that and never worry about it again. So now I just got the America's first platinum card, the United cards, and I paid 100,000 miles just to have a family plan for the lounges because it is getting a little uncivilized out there in in commercial travel. The crowds are I mean, I guess the economy, you know, I keep hearing the economy, and like maybe it's slowing down, um, or maybe people aren't flying as much domestically. Yeah. I mean, it's it's crazy at these airports. It's it's crazy in the airports. And what I'm kind of blown away by, and I I don't want to look back at my younger years and say those were better, 'cause I I, you know, rose tinted glasses, Jason, but does it seem to you that flights just don't really leave on time anymore? Never. And they also are always oversold. And so I feel like every time I go to the airport, I'm like, \"All right, putting on my gladiatorial gear,\" and I just want to freaking get on the seat that I bought and not be harassed too much and maybe have a coke, you know? Like I it's pretty crazy. I mean, I guess we take it for granted in some ways that you can fly anywhere, anytime for a a very reasonable price, which I think is the major success of this, but it does come at a price. Yes. If you keep lowering the cost and you keep working on that as a product strategy, and it's it it does seem to be pretty competitive. You know, you would think there was less competition in airlines because of, you know, how expensive it is. Except I I I feel like I have four choices, three choices of carriers every time I fly somewhere in the United States. Like, \"Oh, go Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, United.\" I mean, it's like almost everybody fly American. Here's what I want though, Jason. If you want to buy a car, you can buy a nice, a nice low-cost Kia. Super dependable. We'll get you where you want to go. Not flashy. Or you can go and get yourself um a hand-painted Bentley. Yeah. Where's the where's the the Porsche? Yeah. Cayman middle ground of airlines, you know, like the economy plus. Yeah, there should be something in the middle. You're right. I think who used to be that. I think JetBlue had a pretty good case to make there. Or Virgin America. Virgin. That was it. Yeah. No, Virgin America was great. So good. Can't believe they sold that. Yeah. It's a bummer. All right. So, what are the top stories in the news today? Let's go through the news and some startup news. Yes, sir. So the number one story I think is that Meta's enormous AI push is now really impacting the startup world. Recall, Jason, that they are trying to build a new super intelligence team. This is where the scale AI quas acquisition came into play. The latest story is that Safe Super Intelligence, which is the company that Ilia, I always forget how to pronounce his last names, Sus suts s u t-sk. Yeah, I think we got it. Yeah, that uh former OpenAI leader Ilia Suskver founded with Daniel Gross. Um, Safe Super Intelligence or just SSI raised, I believe, $3 billion and was recently valued at $32 billion. Now Meta wanted to buy it outright, and reporting says that, you know, Ilia said, \"No, thank you. I'm not interested in that.\" And so what Meta is doing is probably it is working on uh taking the other co-founder, Daniel Gross, and also his investing partner, Nat Freiedman, the former GitHub CEO, in kind of a package deal while also taking a stake in those two gentlemen's venture capital fund. So probably a pretty big investment here from Meta. Once again, underscoring how much money they're willing to put to work. I'm just getting a little perplexed, Jason, at these weird AI deals and why every single one of them seems to be multi-art and complex. And I I'm trying to figure out why, I guess. Yeah, there's a very simple why behind this. Um, if you go pull up the Facebook market cap and the uh and their cash hoorde, uh, just generally speaking, broad numbers, and then you put it against the prize for winning the AI race. um artificial general intelligence, super intelligence, superhuman intelligence. People are using different words for this. We had a little debate about it on All In, which will come out, I think, the same time you'll be listening to this. Okay. Um, it's a big prize. It'll affect many, many different industries. White collar, blue collar, we've talked about this. You know, you got self-driving cars and robots in factories like Amazon. Basically, every industry is going to be impacted by this. So, whoever wins uh gets there first or becomes one of the top three players is going to take part in a $10 trillion prize, let's say. And you have a market cap like Zuckerberg does of So, it's $1.72 trillion. Okay. $1.7 trillion. Yeah. In the last quarter, uh Meta's operating cash flow, Jason, was $24.0 billion, and its free cash flow was $10.3 billion. And the company's current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 70.2 billion as of March 31st. Okay. So you got 70 billion laying around. You pay a dividend, right? I believe that's the dividend-paying company now. Yep. And uh you've got a giant market cap. The market cap of this prize, if if it's 10 trillion, has the ability to double or triple your market cap. if you were to win, but 25% of it, you know, win 202.5 trillion dollars in market cap easily added, right? So even if you got the, let's say, gold gets 50% of the market share, and silver gets 25, and bronze gets 15, and everybody else shares the rest or whatever some distribution there, uh, which we see in other industries, absolutely, uh, you might see a similar thing with smartphones, right? Two players, a duopoly, and then a a long, long tail of like weird phone companies at the end. What would it make sense if you had a bet in poker and the implied odds were you could triple your market cap and secure your legacy. You know, how much would you be willing to gamble? How much would you be willing to risk is the question. I think he would be willing to risk easily 20%. 10, 20%. Would not even be a scratch, right? It's just like a bruise. It's not a big deal if you lost 10 or 20%. Like Elon losing a rocket the other day. It's like that's a little, \"Oh man, that's a little stingy,\" you know, like, \"Ooh, ouch.\" You know, it stings, but it's not like SpaceX is going anywhere. They're launching two or three rockets a week of the other ones, but No, but every time Starship doesn't crush it, Jason, it sets back the Alex gets to space date ever so slightly. And every day there, man. Like, I need I really want Starship to work. So, yeah, that's this is that's what this comes down to. On a personal basis, he's willing to risk 20% of his legacy. That's 170, that's $350 billion in market cap. uh 20% of their cash on hand, you know, and cash flow coming, and they could basically just say to the shareholders, \"We're not going to post a profit anymore. We're not going to do um a uh dividend, and we're going to be buying and investing in artificial intelligence like nobody's business.\" And well, yeah, we'll still do the Meta glasses thing, but that's going to be, you know, they're going to have to make it work with 10% of their budget. They can just make slow incremental progress. We're going for this prize now.\n\nAll right, we all know if you're a founder or even if you're a small business, you're thinking about your company 24/7, 365 days a year. That's the life of a founder. This is not clock in, clock out, 9 to 5 gig for you as the business owner. So when you're hiring, you want a partner that's as equally as committed as you are. And that's, of course, LinkedIn Jobs. LinkedIn Jobs is like your co-founder. They're going to make it so simple for you to post your jobs for free on LinkedIn where there are 1 billion members. You're going to be able to share what you're posting and actually keep all the promising candidates organized in one place. And also, LinkedIn is going to help you quickly write a job and get it in front of the right people, whether you want to post for free or use some promotion to get it in front of even more qualified applicants. So, do me a favor. Don't take my word for it. I mean, you should kind of know what I'm talking about. is where I find my great people. But just understand that 72% of small businesses using LinkedIn said that it helped them find the best candidates. So find out why more than 2.5 million small businesses already use LinkedIn for hiring. So here's your call to action. Post your job for free. Why wouldn't you do it? It's free. Fr. That's a good price. LinkedIn.com/twist. Once again, that's linkedin.com/twist to post your job for free. Terms and conditions do apply. So, here's a fun question. How much money did Meta spend in Q1 on dividend payments? Well, it turns out the answer actually, do you want to guess or just want the answer? Oh, well, let's think about it. Um, I don't know. Let me get you a number. Well, I'm going to say 10. I'm going to just say uh 10 billion. It was only 1.3 billion in the quarter, but they also rebought 13.4 four billion dollars worth of their shares. Um, I think we forget occasionally how much money the mag seven make because I'm like, \"Oh, you know, a billion here, billion there,\" it really adds up. It turns out, \"Nah, not so much.\" I mean, their their free cash flow is like three billion a month. The way you look at this is the same bet OpenAI made on Johnny IV. Yeah. So Sam Wman's out there like, \"I can't believe they're offering a hundred billion dollars to an employee of mine.\" He's collecting his pearls. Did you see that whole thing? like, \"Oh my god, this is terrible.\" Yeah. And it turns out he gave 6.5 billion to like Johnny IV for part-time work. Yeah. Like Johnny IV, I think probably Johnny Iv owns, you know, some significant percentage of that company. It was his company. So he owns at least half of it or two-thirds of it of that 6.5 billion. You got four billion. So you paid four billion for one employee, and you're complaining about somebody getting a hundred billion hundred million dollar signing boost when you just gave somebody 50 times that or 60 times that. Yeah. When this many smart people believe the prize is imminent and the prize is big, you get to see some unnatural things occur, and that's what we're seeing. I think that's totally valid. Now uh a question for you is when is it too early to sell? Because Safe Super Intelligence, Ilia's company is incredibly young. There's no product on the market yet. They haven't really even shown off much of what they're building. We know it's AI and probably super\n\n\nIntelligence with extra safety controls.\nI mean, just given the name, but Jason, you know, why wouldn't you take such an enormous potential check for post money?\nHe's post money.\nHe's got enough equity and OpenAI that, uh, again, when you're talking about individuals and individual behavior, it has to do, uh, often in the early part of people's careers.\nYou see this anxious grinding, desperately trying to get to money, and people seem like they are just aggressive lunatics doing cutthroat things.\nThen later in your career, you have money in the bank, you realize you're not spending it.\nYou realize the cheeseburger tastes the same if it's a $10 really good In-N-Out burger, a $50 one with a little wagyu in it, or like I had one time, like a $100 burger in New York.\nThere was like this craze, and it had, um, you know, black truffles on it for like, and you know, whatever.\nYou know, I sat there and I just, I was with a couple people, and one of them, well, one or two of them were billionaires and stuff like that, and I realized, ah, this is pretty interesting.\nA DoorDash driver could work 5 hours.\nUhhuh.\nAnd enjoy the same $100 hamburger as the billionaires and everybody in between.\nSo once you get to that level, you start to understand non-economic reasons to do things in life.\nNone of those billions matter.\nNothing after like the first 10 or 20 or $30 million actually matters, to be totally honest.\nSo here we are.\nThat's why he's making a non-economic decision.\nThe economic decision would be to take those chips immediately.\nYeah.\nUm, and if he didn't have the OpenAI shares and whatever else he earned in his career, I bet you he would.\nI was trying to figure out what is the dollar value of independence, but I think that's actually the wrong question to ask her.\nThe real question is, are you willing to once again go work for someone else instead of yourself if you don't have to?\nAnd the answer just appears to be no.\nAlso, producer Lawn pulled up that was called the money's no object burger, we think, Jason.\nSo, it was wagyu, it was grade A Hudson fuagra, an onion marmalade made with a port, and then also a quarter inch of freshly shaved Italian white truffles.\nUm, that doesn't actually sound good.\nIt's a train wreck.\nToo much going on.\nYeah.\nWay too much.\nActually, you know what?\nAn In-N-Out Burger is like one of the finest pieces.\nIncredible.\nYeah.\nI have like, there's so many run-ins with the tech industry in In-N-Out.\nLike Postmates put In-N-Out Burger.\nI think DoorDash did it without permission, and then they got in trouble.\nThey got in trouble for that.\nThey are making it happen in Dallas.\nWe, we talked about it before in a previous episode.\nThere are lots of eight-pound deliveries occurring right now.\nYeah, I'm more convinced than ever that DoorDash drivers are going away.\nThat entry-level rung job is going to be done by these little four-wheel R2-D2s.\nUh, the Cocoa and um, Serve Robotics, Serve Robotics, those things are working.\nI think they're largely flawless.\nAnd if one of them gets knocked out, who cares?\nThey are remote operated.\nThere's tele operation going on there, but soon it won't be.\nThe drone delivery seemed far, and now it feels inevitable to me.\nUh, one last thing on the gisting before we go on.\nI just looked it up.\nShake Shack stock price $132 a share went public at 21.\nOh, okay.\nSo, they're doing good.\nYeah, they're doing fantastically.\nSo, I wonder what the price earning is on that.\nI wonder if like, how do you value, I wonder if it's a meme stock or if it's like a legit just being valued like any other fast food gen.\nI don't cover that sector, obviously, so I have no idea.\nAnd there's also seems to be a very big trend with these.\nI wonder if it is built to last or if it's, you know, like the Korean yogurt phase of Red Mango and all those that swept California.\nI don't if you remember that, everybody had to go out for yogurt, you know, and get these like tangy yogurts, and then it just went away.\nUm, okay.\nTurns out it's uh, three to four X price sales just as a data point.\nAll right, moving on.\nUm, I want to talk about Midjourney.\nThis is a company that Jason, I had not actually put on the TWiST500 because they've effectively not raised any known capital, and so they were a little bit outside of the domain of the TWiST500, but after what they announced today and a couple of other reasons, I am going to put them on.\nI'll explain that later.\nThe news here is that Midjourney, which is famous for its image generating tools, has finally moved into the video space, and for a company that has reportedly reached nine figures of revenue and has quite a lot of market reach, it's kind of a big moment for the company.\nSo, uh, I took the liberty of grabbing an image of you, and I'm going to go ahead and show everyone this, a Jason-approved image of himself.\nI believe this is from the All-In show.\nAnd then if you take that image and give it to the new model.\nWow.\nYeah.\nAnd what's interesting is, Jason, this is actually a 5-second clip because it does it in 5-second chunks now, but it automatically made me four different versions.\nAnd so I just went ahead and picked the one that I thought made you look the least creepy because it doesn't quite get the mouth right.\nIf you watch, it's a little too static.\nUm, but this is prompt free.\nI literally just gave it this image and V1, their new video model, made this and a number of other things.\nVery impressive.\nWell, this is super impressive when you compare it to like The Irishman.\nNetflix did, you know, the Scorsese film where they daged folks, and um, yeah, I heard a story about that one where they wanted to use this deaging technology, but it would have required them to put like the ping pong balls and, you know, on Dairo's face and Aluccino's face, and they're like, &quot;Yeah, we're not doing it.\nIt's not for us.&quot;\nYou know, and they wouldn't, they refused to do it.\nBut then the Netflix team, you know, was told they're 18 months away from like the deep fake thing working.\nAnd so they shot it with that technology, and they said they'll, they'll get it done in post, and they, it was okay, but a lot of people complained about it.\nThen there was Luke Skywalker, uh, in The Mandalorian.\nThey daged, uh, at this point, you know, if you didn't see it, it's okay.\nUh, no, no more spoiler alerts, but they, they daged Luke Skywalker.\nMark Hamilton's obviously pretty old.\nThat one didn't quite cross the uncanny valley.\nThis is better than both of those.\nI want to show one more example because this is the first one that really sold me on this before I went ahead and made one of you, Jason.\nThis is from a prompt that a user had done over on the Midjourney service.\nAnd the prompt was just reading it for everybody.\nA portrait of a woman in the grass with sunset lighting.\nHer long hair is blowing in the wind and the red-colored light is shining on it against a dark blue background.\nThis is a hyperrealistic photograph with a cinematic feel.\nAnd as you can see on my screen, there is that image.\nAnd then you click play because it turned it into a 5-second clip.\nWatch this.\nI mean, that's incredible.\nYeah.\nIndistinguishable from the from real life.\nIf you were scrolling, I mean, if, if I told you like, we're doing a test right now, you have to pick the AI one.\nYou might pick it like if you really studied it.\nYou can look for little clues and stuff like that.\nBut yeah, it's, it's, it crosses the uncanny valley as defined by me as if it was scrolling in your feed, you wouldn't be able to tell.\nInvestors like me are not going to invest in your business unless you're structured properly.\nSo founders, if you're serious about raising money, you need to set up your business the right way.\nAnd that starts with a registered agent.\nBefore a venture capitalist can wire you a single dollar, they're going to check if your company is incorporated and it's in good

companies.\nTalked about them a lot on the show.\nCreated by Humans, one of your investments, Tolbit and Human Native.\nThe latest news here that I'm really interested in.\nExplain what those are.\nThat, that little, uh, Yeah, since most people are, it's a new category of.\nYeah.\nSo these are companies, startups that want to create a marketplace that connects IP holders, people who own a podcast like Jason or a blog like me and have content that AI companies may want to train or otherwise access.\nAnd essentially it creates a marketplace where they can reach commercial terms for that.\nThe problem that websites are facing is getting worse.\nPeople are scraping more, and they're sending fewer people back, and the ratios keep getting more and more out of whack.\nSo the news here, apart from just the overall situation getting worse, is that Cloudflare is building a tool that is going to, they claim, really wall off unwanted AI scraping.\nAnd if this tool works as well as Matthew Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, kind of says that it's going to, he joked that he's taking on North Koreans every day.\nHe can surely take on some CC corp based out of Palo Alto.\nUh, then it could overnight change the math on AI usage because people do a lot of AI searches, and that involves a lot of AI bots going out and scraping data.\nSo I'm encouraged by this as a person who writes on the internet.\nI'm also kind of thinking this is going to be a huge boon to companies like Tolbit because suddenly if they have no access to stuff, people are going to have to go out and pay for it.\nWell, I'm an investor in one of these, uh, created by humans, and I think it's great that there'll be a market, uh, for, uh, content on the web and allowing people to do the right thing.\nAnd I think the lawsuits are going to keep piling up.\nI know that people use RAG and all these things.\nThey, they search websites.\nYou know, when you do an OpenAI search now, it almost by default goes out to the open web and then creates your response.\nSo I think the reason they're doing that is the legal reason.\nI noticed that on OpenAI, at least the sources are kind of buried now.\nThey don't put them up prominently enough.\nI think they should say, you know, we collected this information from this website before they present the data.\nI think the content companies on the web should start forcing them to change how this stuff is presented to increase the clickbacks to their website, and then they could make a Google-like arrangement, which is, you know, you search, people search, we send you traffic, it should be okay with you, but honestly, I think everybody should block these tools, and they should on mass sue these LLMs for a licensing fee, you know, if you're doing it professionally for a business, and if you, now if you're doing a blog and you don't care if it's your personal blog or you're doing cautious optimism and you think I don't care, like, just put me in there.\nI want to be represented, and you know, they're, those people are never going to pay 100 bucks a year for a Substack, so who cares.\nThis is all good for the industry.\nThe industry starts need to thinking needs to start thinking about sustainability, not just doing what they're doing now, which is strip mining.\nUh, the strip mining by LLMs is going to just destroy the environment, and then there'll be nothing left for everybody else.\nUh, stop taking the Cali kite from Gorbon destroying the planet or the kyber crystals, you know.\nUh, if you succeed in stripping all this stuff, you're just going to be nothing left.\nIt's almost like overfishing.\nThey're overfishing.\nThey're going to take every piece of cod out of the ocean, and then they're going to wonder where the cod went.\nJust take 10% of the cod, you know, like you don't have to take 100%, uh, and, and maybe, you know, leave whatever the cod eat, you know, like you got to be sustainable.\nI think I said enough here.\nYeah.\nSo, uh, I also asked, uh, Created by Humans what they think is the best way to go about creating a more equitable marketplace.\nAnd they said something that kind of surprised me a little bit.\nThey wrote, I'm just going to quote here, &quot;We recommend evolving the robots.txt protocol into an AI-ROT.txt standard so that websites can specify what's available and what's not with a few lines of code.\nThis could free up most of the web for training without a license while ensuring that commercial or paywalled works are clearly marked as opt-in only and accessible through licenses.\nSo I think that's very generous, but I feel like people still just go around it and say that it's, it's RAG and it's fair use.\nAnd I, I don't think, I think they need to be meaner is my take.\nUh, you know, so there's two ways you can do things, you know, uh, as an industry.\nYou can be regulated, um, or you can use the legal system, or you can create your own system.\nIt's really three ways.\nA lawsuit can happen that you, um, produced a movie and my underage kid went to it and they were traumatized by it and they saw The Exorcist, and now I had to send them to therapy.\nI wonder if that happened.\nSo the music industry, the movie industry would then have to deal with a lawsuit and hiring lawyers.\nThen you could be regulated by the industry, the by the government.\nThe government can say, you know, you guys are out of control.\nWe're going to regulate you now.\nYou got to go to a sensor.\nWe got this like group in Washington that's going to check your work and, you know, we'll do it for you.\nOr you can do what they did quite sensibly and create the MPAA.\nYeah.\nWhere they gave a bunch of money to an organization that they created.\n\n\nAnd then,\nwhen parents came to them and\ncomplained, they said, \"Well, we have\nthe MPA. Would you please, uh, go visit\ntheir office, or, you know, they'll do a\ncall with you and explain the strategy.\"\nAnd, um, they're responsible, and they are\nthe arbiter of what gets PG versus PG-13,\nand you can take your complaint to them,\nand the government could go call that\ngroup, right? That's what the industry\nneeds here, and the industry should do it,\nor else it's going to be endless\nlawsuits, uh, and then there'll be\nlawsuits from consumers, and then the\ngovernment will eventually step in. And,\nuh, the great news to hear is we just\ntalked about how much money is in AI. I\nthink that the first firm to do a deal\nwith Disney to create characters,\nuh, you know, for image generation and to\ncreate short stories for it and have an\nexclusive in it is going to get 10% more\nusers. Go to Disney, say, \"We want to make\nthe ability for you to Jedi yourself.\"\nRight? You can go make a Jedi\nlightsaber. We want you to Jedi yourself\nand pay, and you, or you can make yourself\na Marvel character. So you say \"Marvel\nmate,\" and it makes Alex and Jason into\nMarvel characters, and we can put\nourselves as Iron Man, or, and we can make\na short video of ourselves in the Iron\nMan outfit. Press the button, the face\nmask opens, and boom, it's your face.\nWhoever does that first, whether it's\nXAI, Claude, Midjourney, pick the\ncompany, OpenAI, whoever has the wisdom\nto do that, some cynics might say, \"Open\nup the can of worms,\" just make a 10-year\ndeal, and then anytime anybody else does\nit, then OpenAI could sue Claude, or\nClaude could sue OpenAI, or Google Gemini\ncould sue whoever, or some new entrant,\nyou know, Ilas company could say, \"Hey,\nwe're doing it. We got the license. Now\nyou're infringing on our ability to do\ncommerce and Disney.\" And you got two\npeople who are upset. That's what\nhappens, you know, when, uh, you start\ngoing above board and you create\nstandards. Those commercial\nrelationships will then create consensus\nand voting blocks legally, and the, and\nthe industry can work it out themselves.\nSo, I really hope that people do this,\nand you would make a, a thoughtful\ndecision with cautiously optimistic,\ncautious optimism, sorry.\nI mean, I, I would, I mean, I just like\nmoney, so sure. If someone came to me\nwith a check, I'd be like, \"Thank you.\"\nMuch like what if five of them, I mean,\nif you said, \"Hey, you can ingest all of\nthis.\" Uh, and every time you read the\npage is $10. If you want to, if you want\neach, each of my articles is $10 to have\nin your, uh, LLM for all time. And there's\n20 LLMs that pay you $10 each. You get\n$200 in incremental revenue per piece\nyou write. By the way, that's when a\npiece gets paid in today's world. If\nyou're Zuckerberg, and you give a hundred\nmillion to a developer to join your\nfirm, you can start giving a million\ndollars each, or a hundred thou, $100,000\neach to a thousand different, you know,\nuh, writers. So, pick your favorite\nthousand rides. Now, will Zuckerberg\never do that? No. Unless he gets sued.\nAnd that's really what has to happen.\nSubstack needs to sue Zuckerberg and\nsay, \"You ingested this stuff. It's\nclear you ingested it,\" and Substack\nplus the writers should be going to\ncreated by humans. And now you've got\nthe writer, the platform, Substack, and\ncreated by humans all going to\nZuckerberg and saying, \"Hey, here's\n2,000 writers that you ingested. Here's\nSubstack, which makes a, is in\npartnership with them. And by the way,\nwe're in partnership with them.\" Yeah.\nSo, F Y P M, frack you, pay me. AI is\nchanging every aspect of the way we do\nbusiness. We all know that. But lots of\npeople, well, they're not getting enough\nout of it. That's my belief. Your AI\napps need to connect to your other\nprocesses, your other systems, all that\ndata you got sitting there. And you can\ndo that with this incredible new tool\ncalled Retool. R E T O O L. Now you can\nquickly create AI agents that will help\nyou get work done, like real work done,\nand solve real work problems inside of\nyour organization. Imagine you join a\nZoom after you had a dedicated AI\nassistant prep your meeting notes. Then\nit sticks around to give you all the\nimportant real-time context and feedback\nthat your colleagues are talking about.\nSo now you're going to be able to design\nreally sophisticated user interfaces,\nagents, and processes without\nsacrificing performance or\ncustomization. Retool is trusted by over\n10,000 companies, including our pals\nover at RAMP. So check out Retool today\nand get your AI on doing more than just\ntalking. Go to retool.com/twist\nto learn more. That's retool.com/twist.\nThe BBC is threatening to sue\nPerplexity. BBC is a British\nbroadcasting corporation, and Perplexity,\nof course, is the very well-known AI\nsearch startup. Jason, we talked about\nhow it crossed 100 million in ARR\nearlier this year. Hundreds of millions\nof searches done each month. And, uh, the\nBBC is like, \"Hey, stop taking our\nstuff. Delete what you have and offer us\nsome money.\" And Perplexity is saying\nthat the BBC's claims are manipulative\nand opportunistic and that they quote\nhave a fundamental misunderstanding of\ntechnology, the internet, and\nintellectual property law. The other\nthing here from the FT is that\napparently the BBC is in talks with\nother AI companies, including Amazon. So\nmy read here is that everyone else is\ngoing to pay. Perplexity didn't want to,\nand so they're going to get sued, but I\nthink that's a mistake. I think they\nshould have just paid. Yeah. I mean, you\nand I are on the content side. It's\nfairly obvious, you know, if it's just\nthe headline of the story and you're\nsending traffic, then Perplexity, then,\nyou know, FT and BBC and everybody else\nwould have a different position. When\nyou ingest it, put it into your\nlearning, you know, you summarize it. If\nit's maybe behind a pay wall, that\ncreates another issue. So, FT is behind\na payroll. So, here's the thing, though.\nWhat if your competitors aren't acting\nethically and you want to? So for\nfounders, let's say that their, their\ncompetitor is just scraping everyone's\ninformation without doing proper\ncompensation. How, where should you draw\nthe line on like maintaining your\nethics, Jason, but also not getting run\nout of time by a competitor who might\nhave a more fast and loose approach to\nsay fair use? Oh, well, what happens is,\nuh, these competitors all will then go to\nthose content providers instead of the\npot. It's kind of like immigration. Here\nwe go. Um, the people who are most\npissed off about an open border are the\npeople who came in and waited in line.\nYes. Which makes total sense. If you\nwaited in line for your hamburger and\nsomebody cut the line, you're like,\n\"That's effed up. I don't care if I've\nalready finished my, if I finished my\nhamburger 5 years ago and you cut, I see\nyou cutting the hamburger line. I'm not\nhappy.\" And I think that's what you see\nhere is like the fairness thing. And\nthis is all, you know, when you talk about\nfair use, there are instances of fair use\nthat people who are doing non-commercial\nprojects or using small amounts of the\noriginal work or doing commentary on the\noriginal work that Perplexity is just\nnot going to fall into. If Perplexity\nused a human to summarize these articles,\nread them and summarize them, even if\nthey're behind a paywall, you could do\nthat. That is fair use if a human does\nit. It is not fair use if you do it\nprogrammatically with a machine. Yes,\nfair use means that somebody's giving\ntheir opinion, they're transforming the\nwork, and they're making some commentary.\nSo I could literally take the most\nprotected image in the world, whatever\nit is, whatever it happens to be, could\nbe like who protects their IP the most,\nDisney, Mickey Mouse. I could literally\ntake a Mickey Mouse cartoon, do\ncommentary over it, picture in a\npicture, and play the entire movie. And\nif you want proof of this, there's a\nStar Wars film where a guy does his own\nvideo commentary over a Star Wars film.\nThis guy who was not a fan of the\nprequels speaks and talks over the\nprequels\nand does it. There's also a group of\npeople who redid the prequels and took\nlike Anakin's whining out and made it a\nlittle bit darker. And I think they took\nepisodes one and two and made it, or\nmaybe they took one, two, and three and\nmade it into like a three-hour movie,\nbut took out a lot of the whining and\nmade it more like, uh, hardcore. Uh, so\nanyway, long story short, people can do\ntransformative works. This is not that.\nAnd if you want an example of a\ntransformative work, it's called\nBusiness Insider. Business Insider's\nentire business was to subscribe to pay\nwalls and to circumvent them. So every\nstory on the information you can go\nwatch. Toeer Grace did this edit, did his\nedit of the Phantom Edit. The Phantom\nEdit. Yeah, there you go. Shout out,\nshout out Toeer. Well done. And you\nknow, if you do it non-commercially and\nyou're not making money, it's\ntransformative. You're making some sort\nof a statement, you might be able to get\naway with it. You know, you still could\nget sued, but, you know, people will have\na long-term debate. The thing that's\nvery interesting about fair use cases,\nthey all get settled. So to find a fair\nuse case that got actually to completion\nis really hard. Okay, let's keep going.\nAll right. Uh, Jason, it's time for an\noffice hours. I'm really excited about\nthis one. We are going to talk to Giram\nTaitana from Doctours. Jason, he is the\nco-founder and CEO. Doctours is in the\nlaunch accelerator cohort number 34. And\nwhile he comes up here on the screen,\nI'll just tell you their one simple\nsentence is that they are a medical\ntourism marketplace. Pronounce your name\nfor us one more time so we get it right.\nIt's Gum. Gum. G I R U M. Girum. It is\nactually your name. You don't know this\nis a Greek name. Girum topolis. It means\nto be wise and hardworking and return\nhuge amounts of tributary\nto your investors. This is what it\nmeans. Uh, that's exactly what we're\nworking for. Perfect. I heard you guys\nwere talking about Greek pes before\nthis. Yeah, absolutely. So, Gum, um, what\na great idea. You know, I love a good\nmarketplace. Tell us the state of\ntourism. I know people love to go to\nMexico to get breast augmentation,\nteeth. I don't know if it's a good idea\nor not. South Korea, amazing\ndestination. Eastern Europe. Uh, it seems\nlike, uh, cosmetic surgery is becoming\npeople's passion. Maybe too much in some\ncases, maybe too young. Putting it all\naside, uh, people want to look good.\nOkay. I, I'm not, no shame in the game, I\nguess. Uh, I've been considering it\nsince I got this ompic jowl here. I got\nto figure out what to do. I need to get\na little staple here or something. They\ntell me. Uh, my friends are now, they\nmade fun of me for being fat, and now I'm\ngetting made fun of for having a turkey\nthing here. I don't know. You tell me,\nGum, what I got to do. But, um, explain\nto me how big this market is. I want to\nstart with market because you have a\nmarketplace. The market size really does\nmatter. So, how many Americans are going\nand doing this? Where are they going?\nWhat are the top treatments? Yeah. So,\nI'll answer this across the world and\nthen just the US. Okay. Um, so if you\nlook at the the American market, uh,\nthere's about 1.4 million American\nmedical tourists in 2024. This number is\nup from 340k. So, the market is\nreally growing. Um, if you look at the\nglobal market, cosmetic surgery is the\nbiggest category of medical travel, like\nyou mentioned, but amongst Americans,\nit's actually dental. Um, so it's\ndental. Uh, globally cosmetic surgery,\ndental, uh, followed by fertility\ntreatment, uh, which is very interesting,\num, and a bunch of longtail, uh, pro\nprocedures down the line. Uh, if you\ncompare the number of medical tourists\nto the global, um, global elective\nprocedure spend, it's not that, it's\nactually a much, much smaller niche. So\nour vision is how can we dominate this\nniche and then grow it eventually to\ncompete with the local elective\nprocedure market. Uh, I see on the\nwebsite hair transplants are big, huh?\nThey are. Um, they're, they're growing\nmassively. We're working with. Yeah. So,\nI don't know if you, if you guys have\naccess to our slides or anything. If you\nlook at the Google Trends data is just\nexploding. Um, specifically in Turkey.\nUm, if y'all are on TikTok at all, you\nmust have seen this. I have seen this on\nTurk. In Turkey, the, they make this joke\nabout the airline flights. You see these\nguys have like their heads banded with\npeople going there. So what does it cost\nto do that in Turkey versus the US, and\nthen what can people expect in terms of\nquality? Let me start with attacking the\ncost question first. Um, by the way,\nthere's good clinics in the US. Uh,\nthere's good clinics abroad. There's\nterrible clinics in the US. There's\nterrible clinics abroad as well. But if\nyou have a budget of, let's say, $10,000,\nyou're going to the worst, um, clinics in\nin the US. You don't want to travel, the\nsame amount of money will get you the\ntop tier doctor, which would be\ncomparable to the top doctor here in the\nUS. Uh, so holding cost, co, uh, your cost\nconstant, the quality that you get abroad\nis much, much higher. The second thing is\nthe reason for platforms like doctor\ntours need to be around is to protect\nthe consumers from, you know, going to\nsome basement and getting a treatment\nthat isn't safe for them, right? We verify\nthe clinic, we look at their local\ncertifications, their global\ncertifications, uh, the number of\nAmericans they see every single year,\nverifiable reviews, etc., before listing\nthem to our website so that the American\nconsumer, uh, could trust that the quality\nof care that they're getting is, is much,\nmuch higher. Uh, I was curious how much\nwork is it to actually go out there and\nvet these markets, uh, yourself as a\ncompany, because I'm, I presume there's a\nlot of them. Do you have to go in\nperson? How do you do the quality\ncontrol on the recommendation side?\nYeah. So, so far, we've been asking them\nto, um, submit their certifications. If\nyou look at a country like Turkey,\nmedical\n\n\nTourism is a national level priority for them.\nSo they're quite strict, a lot stricter than the US is for hair transplant clinics here in the US.\nSo they submit their certifications.\nWe can verify it with the government websites.\nWe also ask them to submit verifiable reviews, which are mostly videos.\nOur go-to-market is also TikTok.\nWe partner with creators who have done their hair transplant abroad at the clinics we list on our site.\nSo there's very direct proof of the quality available abroad.\nDo you remove people from the site if you get complaints?\nIs there some sort of standard?\nI'm curious as you grow this because you're a year one or two startup.\nI'm not sure how long it's been around.\nSo we launched in January, so it hasn't even been a year yet.\nGot it.\nWe haven't had any complaints so far.\nBut yeah, we'd definitely take it down if something bad were to happen.\nYeah.\nSo, I think that's like the interesting thing is how do you certify and do you have multiple levels?\nCuz it seems like you've started with actually hand hair hair transplants is the first category.\nIs there going to be a certification level?\nCuz Airbnb now does like I forgot the name of it.\nI'm staying at an Airbnb here.\nI find myself now like Superhost.\nThat's the thing.\nYeah.\nAnd then there's One Fine Stay and VBO if you wanted to pay 20% more and you know it's going to be incredibly great design and managed by a management company.\nSomebody's going to visit you, maybe they pre-stock the fridge, all that kind of good stuff.\nSo, do you have that concept in mind for your marketplace?\nYeah, certainly in the future it's something that we'll have to do.\nRight now we just look at their local certifications, but you can imagine doctors having a board of surgeons here in the US that come up with standards and then now we go around our partner clinics and ask them to get certified and we can give them a special badge similar to the Superhost and that you know given that they follow US standards.\nThis has two benefits.\nOne, you know, it's a guaranteed safety for the American consumer, but also could be a great revenue stream for us as these clinics pay to get these certifications every single year.\nOne of the most interesting things I've just learned by clicking a couple clicks on your website is that there are eyebrow eyebrow and beard transplants.\nCorrect.\nStole my question.\nWhere where does a wait, where's the donor hair coming for?\nBecause my beard does not come in like a beard.\nIt just like I have a really thick goatee.\nIt's just it's a mess.\nIt's my Irish and Greek side competing with each other.\nLike my Greek side's got this great goatee and the rest is just patchwork.\nWhat how does that work?\nYeah.\nSo, the typical donor area is the back of your head.\nOkay.\nAnd then the sides as well.\nSo, if you've seen you know people that that lose their hair, like the top is gone, but you still have like the crown over here.\nYeah.\nAt the back and the bottom will still be there.\nYeah.\nThat's typically where the hair comes from.\nAnd sometimes you can ask your surgeon to take it from your back or your chest hair.\nUm a lot of times surgeons will deny that, but it is something you Wow.\nTake your back hair.\nI was talking to a number of companies that were in psilocybin, which is the active ingredient in what are called magic mushrooms or mushroom chocolates is how people typically ingest them at parties now in the United States.\nBut the psilocybin you can make synthetic psilocybin.\nI actually think Peter Teal was an investor in this company.\nUm, and I was like, why don't you find a country, send doctors, therapists, do it in a very controlled setting, have doctors ready?\nAnd that's exactly what started to emerge, which is psychedelic or plant medicine tourism.\nHave you looked into that, the psychedelic medicine and healing as a potential for doctors?\nSo, we're trying to stay away from the whole medicine side of things.\nA lot of investors ask us will you import medication from abroad and do arbitrage there etc.\nLike you said have people travel for psychedelics.\nIt's not something we're thinking about.\nOur growth plan is really winning in this hair transplant space.\nFigure out what is the next market, which you think would be IVF.\nAnd then launch dental shortly after that and just stack verticals one at a time.\nSoing IVF is I've gone through it with my spouse so I'm Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWe we have two IVF babies.\nUh infertility expensive.\nYeah.\nWell, as it turns out in Rhode Island, it's mandatorily covered as part of health insurance, which is a little state perk.\nYeah.\nSo, for us, it was actually incredibly affordable.\nWhat is it?\nWhat do you know?\nDid you ever look at the bills of what it actually cost your healthcare company?\nI I don't look at bills.\nMy wife is accounting.\nDo you remember how much you paid out of pocket?\nNo.\nOr was it zero?\nI It was some amount of money between zero and 10K.\nI didn't care.\nSo, just for context, if you were to get IVF done here in the US, it could cost you 30K.\nYep.\nUm if you have insurance, it come down to 10.\nGoing to a place like France or Spain, you can get the procedure done for under $5,000.\nSo, it's an insane.\nAnd that's the first world.\nWe're not talking about emerging markets, frontier markets.\nI mean, going to France or Spain sounds wonderful.\nPeople are going there every summer and going there for spring.\nLike it does feel like there's a lot more to IVF than a hair transplant.\nSo, do you think people would leave the country for a much longer period of time to do that kind of care because that would raise the price just for living expenses?\nOh, yeah.\nTravel.\nYeah.\nWell, well, people are already doing it.\nUh so, okay.\nIt doesn't matter what I think.\nUh will it grow is an interesting question.\nUm so, you can look at the Google trends data on this as well.\nUm for IVF, it looks similar to what hair transplants did in 2022.\nSo we think it's going to rapidly expand in the next few years.\nI was turning 30.\nYeah.\nOh, you think it's a generational thing?\nContinue.\nYeah.\nWell, Gen Z's turning 30.\nThey're expected to be the biggest user of IVF.\nUm, also social media is how the quality of care abroad is really shared and they are the most influenced on what they see on social media.\nSo, we think 2030, you know, plus or minus one year would be great for IVF.\nSo, we're probably going to launch that market next.\nI miss any questions for me and challenges you have with the business.\nMy question for you actually has to do with trust and safety.\nYou asked this.\nIt's the most commonly asked question from investors as well and I shared with you what we're doing on the back end to verify clinics and have them on our platform.\nUm I'm wondering what you think we should do to better communicate this with our consumers today.\nIt's not a huge concern, but as we scale into bigger and bigger markets, I imagine that'll be huge.\nYou famously invested in you know low trust businesses like Uber in the early days, Robin Hood even.\nHow have you seen them grow past this?\nAnd what advice do you have for us?\nProactive communication, rating systems, mutual rating systems all played roles in those.\nCustomer support plays a major role.\nUm blog posts back in the day were great ways to communicate complex options.\nSo here, you know, even in this conversation, you and I, you know, I asked you some questions about beards and you had like these incredible then I asked you, hey, what about like is eventually there going to be gene therapies?\nYou had a great answer.\nThese discussions are not on your website yet, right?\nBecause you're a young startup and or maybe they are, you know, I guess in your FAQ you have some of them.\nSo I think you know to the extent you can explain these things to where your audience lives, which seems to be TikTok, your Instagram, I would keep working on refining the quality of those.\nYou're in healthcare.\nI think making them really tight and highly produced, maybe a high quality here's what a hair transplant is.\nI'm here at this clinic, here's three people we interviewed about it, like really getting into it and then some of those is you might be able to put advertising behind and actually convert into customers.\nI'm assuming you get paid hundreds of dollars per referral, low hundreds of dollars, something in that space, or each transaction is worth low hundreds of dollars.\nAm I ballpark correct?\nIt ranges a lot depending on what clinic you go to, but we're aiming, you know, 750 per person all the way to 1,500 per person.\nGreat.\nSo, you're getting 10 20% of the procedure, which is pretty common in this kind of space.\nUm, I think investing, you know, five or $10,000 in a couple of short videos, you know, really well as an investor in the company, having that highly produced asset that builds trust and uh, you know, having a way to build that content on a regular basis that takes these questions headon, or finding a great doctor from a couple of clinics and then you having the doctor speak to it or you interviewing the customer and the doctor and saying tell me about recovery, you know, the scabbing, the itchiness, highly produced, you know, videos with the actual customers with the actual people doing that tours of the facilities, all those things would build trust and consistency in the brand and the design of the brand does speak volumes as well.\nSo if you look at both Uber and Robin Hood, their design, you know, today would be 10 out of 10, right?\nThis is like world world-class design.\nTheir design started not dissimilar to yours.\nUh your design's like a six or a seven, you know, in terms of aesthetics.\nAnd you know, if you were to go to 10 designers and say rate these websites, they probably give you a six or a seven in terms of, you know, 10 being Robin Hood.\nRobin Hood came out of the gate at eight and a half, nine.\nThey really worked on it.\nI would again as an investor say if you told me I want to spend $5,000 with two different designers to make our design worldclass, invest $10,000 in this and then throw it all away and then spend another 10,000 and do that in a year or six months later and I'm going to drop $20,000 on design.\nI would say probably a good use.\nPeople do judge books by their cover and really world-class design, although it seems of low importance.\nAirbnb was another one that was eight and a half, nine out of maybe a nine out of design.\nSo this is really an interesting thing.\nYou know, I really appreciate your question.\nDesign equals trust.\nWe can all remember the iterations of Uber.\nUh Alex will show you the first landing page for Uber.\nIt's very famous how terrible this landing page was.\nSo much so it's almost like a meme.\nPeople share it all the time.\nUh and I remember when Travis was showing me like an early version and we were doing like a little product review.\nI said, you know, I got a question for you about the the the cab.\nYou know, we're calling this Uber taxi or Uber cab.\nAnd I was like, you know, Uber Cab is a dumb name because it's not a cab.\nIt's So, can we drop the cab and just call it Uber.com?\nAnd he said, \"Yeah, we're doing that.\"\nI said, \"Can I get credit for that?\"\nAnd he's like, \"I don't understand.\"\nI was like, \"Can you tell the press that I came up with that idea so when they do the movie just like Sean said, drop the th I can get credit for that?\"\nAnd he was like, \"Sure.\"\nUm, but we've already made the decision.\nI was like, \"I don't care about the decision.\nI just care about credit because it'd be funny.\"\nUm, so here you go.\nAnd I'm friends with Troll Parker on demand car service via iPhone and SMS and it showed a cab and when the cab moved it hopped along the route as you can see in that image and it didn't change direction.\nSo when you see it at an intersection it looks like it's coming towards you off of a 2D map like it's going to like jump in the screen and fly into the air straight up.\nWhereas now it points the direction it's going.\nObvious.\nAnd I was telling him about that.\nHe's like it's my number one piece of feedback.\nIt confuses everybody.\nNobody understands it.\nDa da.\nI'm like, \"Yeah, but you could just make how many versions of the car are there?\"\nYou just do an overhead view.\nIt's like south, north, west, east.\nAnd he's like, \"Yeah, but then you have Broadway, which goes on an angle.\nYou got this street.\"\nYou know?\nI was like, \"Ah, yeah.\nSo, you just make one version and rotate.\"\nIt's like, I've had this conversation five freaking times, Jake.\nHow can we stop talking about it?\nThis looks like This is a five out of 10 in design.\nSo, you're ahead of Uber.\nThis is a one.\nThis is the worst thing I've ever seen.\nI mean it communicates what it does on demand car service via iPhone and SMS book car and the app.\nSo the check boxes in the bullet point join for free.\nThe call to action is good or learn more.\nThere is some good stuff here.\nHow it works pricing blog.\nThey did think through objectively what people's questions are and so you can kind of look in the in the history books and design equals trust is I think something we are going to put in our founder university and launch accelerator curriculum.\nSo, uh, somebody make a note about communicating that back to my team, please.\nI want a design equals trust and then they can go to this clip in Q&amp;A and and maybe build a little curriculum around it.\nIt's a very important.\nTell us a little bit about your experience in the program and we'll wrap.\nWe did founder you I think for a different idea.\nI don't remember how long ago.\nOh, really?\nAnd that's how Yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nUh, and that's how we learned about launch.\nUm, favorite part is, you know, getting intros to the investors after the pitches every week.\nIt breaks my heart not getting ranked.\nUm because\n\n\nThere are so many great uh other companies in our cohort, but um, competitive, y'all have it's very competitive, I think. Um, and uh, yeah, y'all have introduced us to some uh amazing first personal thinkers, um, you know, investors who want to see what the future of elective procedures uh, and we're we're thankful for that.\nAwesome.\nYeah, it's a device we have every week.\nWe ask the investors to say after they see the presentations, \"Hey, tell us one, two, and three, which was your favorite startup.\"\nAnd then we give two points for first place, one point for second place, a half point for third place.\nAnd then I create another device.\nThird place and second place, you just say the name of the company.\nFirst place, you explain why you picked them for first place.\nSo if you get first place, you get like an affusive couple of sentences from the person who picked you.\nWhat this device also does is, \"Hey, you picked us as number two.\"\nWas wondering if I can follow up with you and put us in our investor updates.\nYeah.\nSo, it kind of creates a little bit of a connective tissue with some number of investors.\nAlso, you know, if you don't get picked, you know, for three weeks in a row, you have to say, \"Well, why are these other companies getting picked?\"\nAnd then you start to, cuz you're seeing why those people are getting uh startup investor or product investor or market investor or founder investor fit.\nAnd it could be any of those things, right?\nThey they just love the founders's presentation ability.\nAnd they'll say that, \"I just love the founder.\nWow, so dogged, so funny, so clever, so insightful, great answers.\"\nThey might just say that, right?\nYou've experienced that, Giram.\nAnd they just love a founder.\nOther time they're like, \"I love this market.\nThis market's great.\nIt's ripe for disruption.\nOh my god, everybody's going to be doing more medical procedures.\nThey're getting safer.\"\nYeah, I love this market.\nYou can get all those things that occur, but what's most important is the the the competitive nature of getting into an accelerator.\nThen I said, \"Well, how do we make the accelerator itself have a little competition in it?\"\nMhm.\nJust to get people at the top of their game when you're playing basketball and everybody shoots 35 to 40% from three-point range or you know 80 or 90% from the free throw line and you don't you know what you're going to do?\nYou're going to come to the gym an hour early until you do because you want to make the team.\nSo if your design sucks, your market sucks, your business model sucks, and you see other people solving those problems, you just fix it.\nThat's the great part, I think.\nExactly.\nWell, if everyone wants to check out what Doctours is up to, it's drours.co CO and uh you can take a peek around there.\nIt's quite a lot of stuff on there.\nIt was really great job.\nWhere are you based?\nI'm curious.\nWhere are you based?\nI'm in Huntsville, Alabama today.\nLove it.\nYeah.\nAnd this is a co-working facility you're in or just a fancy background?\nThis is the ground floor of our apartment building.\nOh, wow.\nThey have like a co-working space.\nSweet.\nThey have a co-working space.\nYeah.\nAwesome.\nYeah.\nAnd fundraising.\nYou getting good feedback from investors?\nYeah.\nThey have a uh what when they give you like really considered feedback, any consistent feedback you're getting or feedback that you know is like they're just afraid to say \"I don't want to invest in this business.\nI'm just going to give you like a BS reason,\" and have you been able have you learned to parse those things?\nYeah, the liability question is definitely number one.\nUm, we've gotten some feedback from the launch team but also other investors to uh you know have the legal side be very robust and make sure that we're legally protected.\nI think that's what um investors care a lot about.\nI just want to pause you on that.\nWe are have an investment in Gigster and Meowto Stone Algo.\nThese are three very different marketplaces.\nCatsitting, Diamonds, Gigster figured out insurance in a major way.\nSo, if you want to meet Yuri and the team over there, um, just ask Jackie or Bianca to introduce you to Gigster.\nAnd then I think Meowel got their insurance for catsitting.\nThat's a really interesting thing.\nYou could say to the person who's doing the tourism, \"Would you like to get insurance in case your trip gets postponed or cancelled?\"\nThat insurance exists in the world.\nI get upselled on it all the time.\nY um I never take it, but I should think about it.\nAnd then there's uh insurance, you know, for the other side, which I'm sure they have, but they could get it for Americans.\nAnd if you said to them, \"Hey, we want you to pay $100 insurance, you know, as part of the spiff or whatever or the affiliate.\"\nUm, if people ask for it, will you underwrite it?\nIf that's like the thing that is factor for them, what's that?\nIf you're in Turkey, it's required.\nThe government requires clinics to have insurance for their foreigner patients.\nInteresting.\nBut yeah, yeah, this isn't true for for Mexico or um I'm not exactly sure about South Korea, but uh it is it is something that we could offer both sides.\nUm great idea.\nYou could become a blogging machine.\nAnd the I think if you just spoke into a computer with somebody interviewing you and then you had somebody who's a good writer write blog post based on what you're saying and then put citations into it.\nYou could start with just you have an FAQ but a blog about this and then put it on Substack, put it on Beehive, put it on LinkedIn and then you make slightly different versions of it for different platforms.\nNow you're getting multiple swings at bat in the SEO large language model.\nSo that one is like tell me about the insurance.\nDo hair, you know, hair transplant insurance, you know, Mexico versus whatever or a landing page for hair transplants or dental implants, Mexico versus Turkey, Turkey versus France, France versus Spain, what to expect, etc.\nWhat you'll see is in the SAS companies, the savvy SAS companies will make Salesforce versus HubSpot, HubSpot versus Salesforce.\nIt's very interesting.\nOn the Salesforce web landing page or whatever, Salesforce wins in their estimation.\nOn the HubSpot landing page, they'll go back and forth and have this really objective like shootout between the two products.\nMiraculously, HubSpot wins.\nAngel List did an incredible job of this.\nI send people, even though I have the syndicate, I just send people to Angel List.\nThey they got ahead of us.\nThey wrote all this incredible uh FAQs about angel investing, QSBS.\nThey they took the risk of saying, \"Hey, we're going to just put that information out there.\"\nOther people be like, \"Oh, don't give financial advice.\nDon't give advice on this.\nDon't give advice on.\"\nThey like just like, \"Screw it.\nWe're giving advice.\nWe're going to just explain this stuff to you.\"\nInvest Investipedia does a good job at that.\nSo, great job.\nYeah.\nI would look at those two sites uh or those couple of sites as inspiration.\nAnd it could be very lightweight for you to hire a writer to do this.\nLike it might be a $100 per page.\nYou get interviewed by them over a Zoom or you just talk into a microphone.\nThey make the pages.\nYou read them.\nApprove them.\nRead them.\nApprove them.\nRead them.\nApprove them.\nBoom.\nTotally.\nAll right.\nAnother amazing office hours.\nI can't wait to see you in Texas.\nWe're going to do some sort of Texas thing.\nWe have take You like barbecue?\nDon't tell me you're a vegan, please.\nBarbecue.\nYou like barbecue?\nDon't tell me you're a vegan.\nGreat job, doctors.\nIs it do or do usai?\nIt's do.co.\nWe're working on the do.\nI mean, it's a good name.\nDoctors.\nI like it.\nUm, it's very clever.\nI wouldn't worry about it.\nYou could uh get get doctors or go doctors.com as blockers.\nThen when you negotiate with doctors.com, you could say, \"Listen, we don't need it.\nWe've already invested the SEO in this, but if we could get it, it's nice obviously.\nSo, we'd give you this dollar amount.\"\nAnd that's actually becomes true, right?\nUm because the truth is like a great.com does build trust.\nUber went from Uber Cab to Uber.com and they bought that for a couple million bucks.\nYeah, good luck with it.\nUh and I'm really excited.\nI think you're going to have an amazing business.\nIt's going to cash flow great and uh great questions today.\nAwesome.\nThank you.\nAll right, we'll drop you off.\nAnd uh anything else in our docket that we need to get to here?\nAny housekeeping?\nAny founder university stuff?\nAny dates we have to promote?\nUh, no.\nAllin.com summit.\nAll AllinSummit September allin.com yada yada or you just do allin.com and just click on events.\nBut I like to say allin.comyattada yada yada.\nIt actually I think redirects to the all-inSummit.\nuh this week in startups.comdoccket and uh cautious optimism on Substack and I'm like calacanith I think.\nssubstack.com\ngo sign up for email newsletters.\nI I'm going to start writing again.\nI decided I got to unleash my superpower which is writing and get get back in the writing game.\nI'm so jealous of you writing every day.\nUh we'll talk to he's Alex.\nWhat is he?\nHe's Alex Wilhelm.\nSo that means on Twitter X he might be X.com Alex.\nYes sir.\nRidiculous.\nI'm x.comjason.\nEqually ridiculous.\nAnd my Instagram is at Jason.\nSo, go over there if you want to get cheesecake photos of me.\nUm, you know, now that I'm then I'm starting to do these.\nI send I take pictures of myself like with a sultry look and then I send them to my wife like me sipping a cup of coffee.\nI'm like I do this my little cute eyebrow up and then I send it to her and you know what I say?\nWhat?\nYou're welcome.\nYou're welcome.\nI love that.\nWas that Moana that had the song?\nYou're welcome.\nYeah, it's sung by the rock.\nIf I did that to my wife to I love that song.\nIt's so great.\nIt's the worst like most crazy thing in the world.\nAll right, everybody.\nUh oh, we didn't do the Tesla story.\nLightning round it for me.\nYep.\nInvites are out for the Tesla launch in Austin.\nThis is their robo taxi event.\nI believe they're still shooting for the 22nd.\nis going to be a geo fenced area with 10 cars to start.\nThere's going to be remote safety people, which you and I both think is a great way to kick off the overall push.\nAnd as far as I can tell from social media, Jason, they are inviting Tesla friendly influencers to be among the first people.\nAnd that's smart because that'll ensure there'll be Tik Toks, Instagrams, and otherwise tweets about what people are doing.\nSo, I'm stoked.\nI want more competition and self-driving.\nI want Whimo to be scared and in a hurry.\nSo, I can't wait and I hope it goes well.\nYeah, it's going to go well.\nUh I got to ride in uh one of them uh with the cyber taxi robo taxi as I said uh on Saturday in Palo Alto.\nDid three rides all flawless.\nIt's a bit more aggressive than the version I have is my perception.\nI that maybe just me projecting into it, but I actually sat in the driver's seat and um I think they're ready to slowly do testing with the safety driver.\nNow the safety driver in this instance is going to be in the righth hand seat.\nI saw a screenshot.\nSo when you do it, you can bring an extra person with you according to there was somebody had tweeted like the um somebody tweeted all like the details.\nIt's geoenced.\nIt's 6:00 a.m. to midnight.\nIf it's inclement weather, they're turning it off.\nAnd there's a safety driver in the right passenger seat, front right passenger seat.\nSo you can take the two back seats.\nYou can bring one person with you if they're 18 years old.\nYou can do social media.\nThe person in the right, I saw an interface.\nSomebody had screenshotted it.\nThere's two big buttons, pull over and stop.\nSo, the safety monitor, which is not a safety driver because they're not able to take over the steering wheel, can press one of two buttons.\nI think this is halfway to what what I think they should do.\nI think they should have just put a safety driver in, just called it a day.\nMhm.\nBut I guess they feel confident and I, you know, there is a big self-correcting mechanism here.\nIf they get in an accident, yeah, they got big problems.\nAnd then I also saw that the state, I don't know if you saw this, the state had sent a letter to Tesla.\nDid you see this?\nI I saw headlines about that as I was prepping the show.\nBut yeah, so there's a the state sent a letter like, \"Hey, we have some rules here.\nWe need you to, you know, dial this in.\"\nSo lest anybody think that there are not self-correcting mechanisms here for the self-driving companies, there are.\nAnd there was a Volkswagen ID buzz.\nPull up that headline if you don't mind.\nWell, we'll take take your time, but I just want to give people the full context of what's going on here.\nSo, uh, as you can see there, it's obviously geofenced massively.\nUh, the Tesla bears are like, \"Oh, didn't you say you can do it anywhere?\"\nOf course you can do it anywhere.\nThere supervised FSD can work anywhere.\nUnsupervised FSD cannot.\nSo, of course, they're going to.\nNow, that doesn't mean they can't quickly learn.\nThey will quickly learn because it's a neural net.\nIt's designed to simulate off of hundreds of millions of hours they've collected.\nOh yeah.\nUm but it's geofenced and um you know the terms of service and all that other stuff.\nThis is not like Whimo which is ahead of them obviously in terms of deployment.\nThis is like kind of Whimo.\nThis is somewhere between Whimo having a safety driver in the in the driver's seat and only doing Google and Alphabet passengers.\nYeah.\n\n\nAnd you know Whimo public.\nSo, it's just kind of right in between those.\nSeems very wise.\nAnd then here's the Volkswagen headline.\nSo, Volkswagen uh has a has its own self-driving group.\nUm, it's called Moya, M O I A.\nIt's been pretty stealthy.\nLike, they don't really talk too much, but they're doing really consequential work.\nZuks is also doing very consequential work in larger size vehicles.\nYes.\nThat the ID Buzz is an incredible car.\nOpens on both sides.\nSo, this is going to be good for the Uber uh pool lift line concept.\nI still believe five people will be op.\nIf I had to take a guess, I think there'll be five operators in a major city in New York.\nIn a major city in the US, five operators of robo taxis within two years in one city.\nOver under.\nWhat do you got?\nYou obviously have Whimo in Austin already.\nYep.\nOr, you know, imminently.\nLet's just assume Tesla figures out and next year Q1, Q2, they open it up to people.\nSo, that would be two.\nSo, three more got to be added.\nI would put Zuks, the Volkswagen, Volkswagen ID buzz, and then probably one other uh We China or Pony.AI.\nUm, I'm I'm bad at at sports betting, so I want to I want to be more aggressive than your timeline.\nDoes that mean I'm taking the over or the under?\nUnder.\nSo you mean taking under.\nThere'll be five in under 24.\nI'll take the over.\nI'll take the over.\nI think it's under, too.\nBut maybe I set the line to So if I said 18 months, would you be under 18 months or above 18 months?\nThat's that's kind of where my equilibrium point is.\nSo for the sake of being spicy, I'll say under, but that's probably Yeah, I'll take over on 18.\nThat's it.\nSo let's set a date in the notion to check back and then anytime we see a city hit three unique providers, we do that.\nI got a inside piece of information from China on self-driving.\nOh, hit me.\nAnd job destruction.\nWe didn't talk about the Andy Jassy letter uh which you can pull up.\nThe Andy Jassy letter was pretty interesting for me and I saw Andy Jassy at the code conference.\nI got to ask him a question or two.\nUh in China, I was talking to a major CEO founder from China.\nThis is a message from Andy Jassy about generative AI and its impact and that they're going to have less employees because of AI.\nMhm.\nAnd that's the white collar side of the business.\nBut I asked him about self-driving, zuks, delivery, drones, etc.\nI think the most impacted company by AI in the world is going to be Amazon.\nPositive or negative?\nPositive in that it's going to make their earnings go crazy.\nYes.\nNegative for society in that they're going to hemorrhage delivery jobs and factory jobs and white collar jobs.\nYes.\nThey're going to they're going to up and down the stack, decrease their staff size by 5% a year for 5 years, which net net compounding means they'll have 35% less people in the company.\nSomething in that range.\nIt's going to it's going to get very it's it's going to be a third smaller or a third of the jobs are going to go away inside of Amazon in 5 years.\nNow, do they add jobs for other opportunistic things?\nIt's possible.\nBut I think of the current job mix, I could see a third going away because of these technologies in China.\nThere's deep concern inside the party government about jobs.\nYoung men work as drivers.\nYes.\nYoung men unemployed ride in the streets.\nWe saw this in Greece.\nWe saw it in Italy.\nWe see it in the Middle East from time to time.\nWhenever the number of young men 18 to 30 years old, unemployment hits about 15 20%, you get a little bit of uprising.\nIf it goes above 20%, you get riots in the street.\nYou can look at Greece employment riots, Spain employment riots.\nUm, and other countries, Middle East, I think maybe uh Lebanon, Egypt would be another one.\nI think Egypt, uh, in that demographic, there's a lot of unemployment.\nAnd then those people have no time, have free time, and then they can become radicalized, right?\nAnd what does the Chinese Communist Party really value above all, which is political stability and maintainance of control?\nHarmony.\nSure.\nAnd so I think I'm showing a news article here showing that this is back from February.\nSo the data is a little bit old here, Jason, but youth unemployment in China rose to about 17%.\nHoly cow, what a pull.\nThat's shocking.\nYeah, it's really high.\nIt's much higher than the overall rate of unemployment in the country.\nBut a problem that China has is simply that its economy cannot absorb the number of highly qualified college graduates that it produces.\nAnd so they have a surplus.\nAnd so if we're talking about white collar job destruction being a problem here in the US, well, it's going to be twice as that is another situation where they're taking full villages in India and transplanting them to Singapore, you know, uh Dubai, Qatar, etc. for healthcare work, nurses, doctors, construction, etc., restaurants.\nSo they'll go to a village where there's no jobs and everybody's unemployed in India and they're like hey here's an opportunity.\nSo I was talking to so when there's dis displacement like this there's opportunity there's cognitive and you know atom and bitbased moving surplus of energy.\nYou can take this energy and use it.\nAthena is using it right taking assistance.\nGo to AthenaWow.com and get like a month or a couple weeks off.\nUh they're I'm the first investor in that company and a partner.\nAnd so they're shipping $3,000 a month assistance, $36,000 a year all in.\nNo extra health benefits, taxes, hiring.\nThey'll just swap them in and out.\nAnd you get an assistant for half the price of the United States who really wants a job, who will work harder than anybody in the United States ever would or 90% of Americans ever would.\nAnd they call you sir.\nIt's quite charming.\nUm anything else I can do for you?\nIt's like really service- based.\nUm there's an opportunity.\nYeah, there's an opportunity there.\nUh those folks in China who can't get jobs, what can the Chinese government use them for, what where could they be deployed and uh every time you see that and I think you know that's the thing I've been thinking about with job displacement in the US and somebody challenged me I think it was Sachs at this CO2 conference or whatever and I said well what if we just double the number of teachers, doctors, nurses uh and people who do uh elder care.\nYeah.\nWhat if like all these you could take those 16% who are unemployed and you could say you you now all work at nursing homes and your job is to watch TV with them.\nTake them on walks.\nDo a cooking class.\nYeah.\nYou know, basically be a camp counselor.\nBe a It's a camp counseling job.\nLet's call it what it is.\nThese people have nothing to do.\nThey're retired just like kids have nothing to do in the summer.\nYou're a camp counselor.\nKeep them busy.\nMake it fun.\nThe end.\nSo this is what I want founders to start thinking about.\nIf there were 10,000 door dashers available to do something else, what would you have them do?\nOh, interesting.\nSo how to get ahead of the freed up labor force of people that are currently ah 10,000 door dashers do if it's not bringing you boba?\nThey can make me boba and sushi, you know.\nI'm just kidding.\nThey could Well, no.\nI mean, is it's an honest question.\nAnd so is there a a handyman job?\nIs there a butler job?\nI know this sounds crazy.\nNo.\nUh, do you want to start a community garden?\nYou know, dog walking.\nThere there are other things that in society maybe rich people do.\nUhhuh.\nUh chefs, personal chef.\nRich people have personal chefs.\nPoor people like eat fast food and and don't cook.\nAnd you know, then there's everything in between.\nWhat if there was somebody, you know, who has one of these cooking marketplaces and they say, &quot;Hey, we're going to teach people to cook.\nThey're going to cook a meal for 10 families and those 10 families come and pick up from this community kitchen, their 10 meals at a really reasonable price.\nIt doesn't get delivered to them.\nThey have to pick it up on the way home from work, but they get a healthy dinner, leftovers for and then a brown bag lunch and a breakfast for the next day for, you know, 12 bucks a person and it's healthy and it's great and they buy it for subscription.\nSo, start thinking like that.\nthe businesses that didn't have employees or couldn't get employees.\nWhat if there were too many employees and people said, &quot;Yeah, I'll work for anything.&quot;\nThat's what happened with Uber and Door Dash.\nThere was a a surplus of people who wanted to do gig work.\nI predict millions to tens of millions of gig workers coming on the market.\nMan, that is at once an incredibly exciting point and also a very scary one.\nI think I'm going to take the optimistic side of it, but we have a lot of work to do to rebalance the economy in a post chat world.\nNever squander.\nNever squander a crisis.\nChaos.\nThat's capitalism is a lad.\nChaos is a ladder.\nYeah.\nAll right, everybody.\nWe'll see you next time.\nBye-bye.\nBye.\n",
