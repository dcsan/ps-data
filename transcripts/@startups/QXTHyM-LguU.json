  "cleanText": "As an example, when a founder sends us an update, we have a tool that reads the updates, looks for the important data in it, like what's their burn, what's their revenue, what's their growth, and then try to map those to fields in a database and write summaries. Founders will write us, god bless them, 1,000 to 2,000 words of which we have to scan that email and get the top five or six data points. And if those data points aren't in it, the next phase of that tool will be to reply to the founder and say, \"Hey, this is the launch AI bot. Can you give us the last three months of revenue, the last three months of expenses, and then the last three months of burn, which is those two numbers subtracted from each other?\" And uh can you tell us the headcount because we don't have headcount in here. And can you tell us the cash in the bank? So, we need to get those numbers to anticipate fundraising. And we are going to have the bot in the next iteration not just take the update they send us by email typically or sometimes they'll send us a notion page or a docuign a docu send you know we're going to uh do it that way.

Three days a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, we discuss all the top tech news, all the private companies that we track at twist 500.com. We have 500 private companies. I think we're at 350. Alex, where are we at in total numbers there? Do you want me to count the ones I'm adding today or not? Doesn't matter. I have 45 new names. We're about 415. Perfect. So, we're trying to track at twist 500.com the top 500 private companies so that we can have our new producer. We uh you know, this is a big long game. I've been trying to get this Twist 500 done for a year almost. And we now have producer Claude. Some of you know uh Anthropic has this incredible large language model that does incredible things. Agents, coding, does everything. It's got a big open context window where you can put a bunch of data into it. So, I was talking to my team. I said, I want to create a partnership, Alex, with Claude, and I want to have a producer Claude that goes through those 500 names that we have in Twist 500 and then looks for news, looks for um sentiment, maybe companies we've missed and then just gives us ideas on how to make the show better for founders. My premise is pretty straightforward. I think the job of being a producer on a podcast can be done by AI better than a human. I think we'll be there this year in the next 12 months. I think uh AI watching the show, looking at other news, reading comments from our listeners, taking feedback, we'll be able to produce a better show than a human. Why? It's going to work 24 hours a day. Now, humans will still be in the loop. Obviously, you and I are still here for now, but who knows? So, thank you to our friends at Anthropic. We've got a great partnership with them. And they're helping us with all these tools and we're going to call on producer Claude, you know, like once or twice a week to help us with the show. But really what I wanted to do is get attached to this Twist 500 we built with KOD, great database, all the private companies.\n\nOkay, so I have been uh tinkering with this and I was playing with Claude, had a good time, was trying to ingest the whole Twist 500 and pull out all the news and uh Jason, enough babble, enough introduction because today is the day we can finally talk about the launch of Tesla's robo taxi service. Yes, it went live yesterday in Austin. Uh, where you punitively live, even if you haven't been there in a minute. Um, I think this is a huge deal. Elon Musk tweeted out, \"Super congratulations to the Tesla AI software and chip design teams on a successful robo taxi launch.\" He called it the accumulation of a decade of hard work. Uh, it says the AI chip in the software was all built from scratch inside of Tesla. Just first thoughts from you. I'm really curious what you're thinking.\n\nWell, you know, I watched it. Uh, I think it was a successful launch. It's super super conservative, which is what I think any of us would want any entrant to self-driving to do, whether it's Zuks or whoever, because we did see even when you are super conservative like Uber was many years ago and they had a tragic fatality uh where a safety driver was not paying attention, they were in fact playing Candy Crush, like unbelievable negligence on the part of an individual. And then you had Cruise, which that program has been shut down. They were bought by GM. They dragged a passenger on the ground. This is serious business. And Tesla's autopilot has been abused and FSD has been abused by many customers. There have been many accidents. Now listen, there are many accidents in all cars. But if we're going to have them unsupervised, we take the steering wheels out, we hit level four autonomy, level five autonomy. It requires being conservative. Why? The second you make a mistake, the public, the haters, the vigilant, the regulators, consumer sentiment is going to be on top of you. I would say 99 out of a 100 rides will be flawless. One out of a 100 will have a moment just like Whimo did. That's why Whimo had safety drivers I think for five to 10 years like and they still do. Every time they go to a new place they do safety. I think there was one incident yesterday that was, you know, I wouldn't say like horrific, but it was, you know, one of these instances that, you know, anybody who has FSD will have, uh, where, you know, FSD has a hard time making a decision, which is why they have a safety driver. So, we have to outline what constraints the Tesla team put on this. Number one, there is a safety monitor, not a driver. What's the difference? A driver would a safety driver would be in the lefthand seat. A monitor's in the right. The right-hand driver has like three buttons on the dashboard. One of them stop in lane. One of them is pull over. I don't know what the third one is. And then on the right, there was a note that they had their finger their thumb over the door handle the whole time, which I think is like an emergency button. So you'll see online a bunch of speculation like why do these safety monitors in the right hand seat have that. Second thing they're doing they only allowed like super fans of the product on there so they gave early access to like all the people who tweeted and do FSD videos already so you got like a hometown crowd smart move. Um and I think the safety drivers also so somebody the safety monitor is so somebody doesn't like jump in the front seat or do something stupid grab the steering wheel try to hit the pedals. I'm assuming that doesn't work if you grab the steering wheel or you do that. I'm not sure. I was curious about that. So, I went through the entire FAQ for this because I was curious what are the rules about just trying to help. And what they said is you are absolutely not allowed to sit in the driver's seat. So, I think they would really rather you not touch anything. Uh because I think even if you can't influence it directly, it moves the wheel on its own and so you could grab it and stop that and probably screw with the AI. So, I think it's more of like a just a cordoned off. No one gets to sit in the driver's seat, which I think is imminently reasonable. And frankly, if you try to ruin your AI car by messing with it, you deserve to crash. So, yeah. Uh, so, and I wonder in a Whimo what happens if you jump on the steering wheel? Uh, you know, and try to watch this producer Claude. Yeah. Can you figure out what happens for us in a self-driving car if you grab the steering wheel and give it a yank while it's self-driving? Cuz I think that should be something that they've sorted out as an edge case.\n\nOh, so producer Claude is added already. Um, and it says here, if a passenger grabs a steering wheel while the car is autonomous mode, several safety mechanisms would likely activate. I guess this is its best estimation of what would happen. The system would detect the steering likely disengage. That's what happens when you're driving in FSD and you're in the seat. Control trans back to manual. Driving the car would alert the driver. Passenger with visual audio warnings. Robo taxi. The system might allow limited steering input for emergencies. I guess this is Claude giving its best estimate of what would happen, but I don't see citations here. So, more work to be done here. We need to figure out who what should happen or what specifically happens. Uh, and then Whimo has yeah, similar similar rules. Now, just as a reminder to everybody, Jason's right. This is a relatively limited launch. It is still invite only. It is occurring in part of Austin. Rides are a $4.20 flat fee. Have to use the Tesla app. 6:00 a.m. to midnight. No under 18s. And this is the coolest thing that I saw that I didn't know so far. Jason, you can change your uh destination right now in the app mid ride, which is pretty cool. I didn't know that. But if it's a flat rate, they're not charging you per mile or per minute. So, why not?\n\nAll right, founders. Let's talk about your website. I know, Disclad. You're ashamed of your website. I know.

I'll talk over it when you play it. Um it's uh I know the area. If you can get it playing um there is an area um in Austin, which is called South of Congress or South Congress, just South Congress I guess would be the way to say it, below Ladybird Lake. It's a hip part of the city. Uh, lots of like Soho houses down there. Lots of great restaurants. It's not the main part of the city that it's not the downtown area with all the tall buildings. This is like the hipster area. You might think of it like Soho or Brooklyn. Sure. And here you can see cars driving around quite flawlessly. And there on the right obviously is the safety monitor, not a driver. So this is kind of like halfway between, I guess, how Whimo launched or cruise or uh some of the other services. But um you know anybody who has FSD hardware 4 will know this experience which is you know like I said nine out of 10 rides hundreds of miles it doesn't have an intervention is the latest statistic and then it let you uh do a rating and then it offers you to do a tip and then if you try to tip the robo taxi it says just kidding. So that's okay. That's that's funny. I like that. I was going to say like, but are they so cashstrapped they need to have tips going into the central self-driving pot? That's a good joke. I like that. Uh, do you want to watch the short clip, Jason, of the mistake? Sure. Yeah. I think this is how you're going to be judged. So, this is a sort of important lessons for founders. You're going to get you could do a thousand things right in your startup and you're going to get judged by your worst moment. It's unfair, but it is what it is. You know, if you're a restaurant, you seat somebody late, that's the first person who writes your e-help review. If you're a SAS software company and somebody's using a really old computer and they lose, you know, they they don't save their work as they go or they got a terrible internet connection, you're responsible because they lost their document or something. Just the nature of technology. So, assume that you have to be responsible. But, you know, you can hit play here. And what you'll see is it's it's supposed to make the next left turn. And here it realizes, oh, I was making this left turn. That's the wrong one. Let me go try to make the next left turn. It doesn't get into the right lane on the right side of the double yellow line. It stays in the opposite lane. So, it's going in the opposite lane of traffic. That's obviously not good. So, this is why you have a safety monitor.\n\n\nThe question is, what happened here during this, which is a significant mistake. This would be a significant disengagement. And I know this because I drive this since the beginning. And anybody who drives it, even the biggest Tesla fan, will say there's a disengagement every couple of hundred miles. There's tons of statistics on this. Um, and that's why this is a beta trial. It's a closed beta trial because they know that they're going to have these every, I would estimate, couple low hundreds of miles, I think, is probably the statistic. I know when I drive it on my hardware 3 Y, I get probably two of these an hour. When I drive it on hardware one, hardware four, the latest one I have. I have another Model Y with the latest. Uh, I would say it happens once an hour so far. So, once every 50 miles or so. That's not bad.\nWell, it's it's not enough to be a robo taxi. And it's amazing for, you know, uh, augmented, you know, self-driving to help me. So, in other words, we're not in a position where you can sleep in the car.\nNo, we are not. What will happen is these will be documented, and I wonder if the safety monitor intervene there with that button on the right, if that is in fact what's happening, and you can look up online people talking about the right-hand door passenger, and you'll see pictures and discussions of that online if somebody wants to do that.\nI'm going to leave that to uh producer Claude. I want to show you something Jason from the robo taxi launch that I thought was incredibly cool. So from a uh an AI engineer on the robo taxi team, there was this image uh that was shared. This shows the team with the launch. And if you're on the audio version, it's kind of like the the NASA room where they have all the screens and computers. In this case though, no telemetry from a rocket Jason. Instead, it's a lot of information about the robo taxi stuff. But here's the fun thing. They may have shared a little bit more than they meant to because if you look at the screens, there's a really interesting uh bit of data, and I took a screenshot of that and zoomed in for us, and as you can see at this time, they had done 112 rides, 499 miles, and then 35 is this mystery number because I cannot read what users in the system, yeah, users in the system.\n35 users, three rides each, four rides each.\nMakes sense to me. First day, I'm going to go with users, members, or active unique users for the day.\nAh, I like that. I thought it might be disengagements, but I think active users probably makes more sense because folks were taking several. There was the one guy who took 11 rides.\nYeah, I think most of them took two or three, it seems like. And it was open at night. It's open from 6:00 to midnight. I'm going to go with Yeah. And so the average ride was four miles. Average person does four, maybe three. So that's that wouldn't that would uh happen for me.\nThe other thing you see there is you there were, I think, of those 10 monitors or eight monitors, however there were maybe four or five of them were actual cars and the five or six cameras around the car. So if you look bottom left, the second row top, third row top, fourth row top, and then the fifth row. So there's 10 monitors bottom row, and those are six cameras, I guess. Uh, front and sides, back and sides of every car. So you can watch every if they do have five cars on the road. I think they have more. You're watching every single one.\nThere was another picture uh of the engineers, and they had steering wheels in front of some monitors. Now, I don't know if that was for remote takeover of cars and they use a steering wheel or that was like just maybe they had steering wheels and they were doing testing previously or I think that was from a Chinese self-driving that may have been a BU's Apollo go.\nOh, no. I thought that people were talking about it being for Tesla.\nOh. Oh, okay. Well, then I fully misunderstood that. I would have pulled it, but I saw that as as Apollo go, and I was like, well, that's not quite the story. Um, yeah, so they have remote drivers. So, the question is in that video when it's trying to make a decision and you see the line of what road to go on flip back and forth. I was trying to determine I wonder if that's the remote driver taking over and if the hand on the right, so if somebody has that screenshot, uh, Lon, you can just search for it on X. Uh, the button on the right, the door open button. If you search for door open button, you'll probably find it. The the safety drivers the whole time there's somebody in the car have their thumbs over the right hand door. Now, if you're driving a Tesla and you press the door open button, uh it will not open. So, the theory that people are speculating here, and I'm sure Tesla will confirm it at some point, is the safety drivers are intended to have their hand over that button. If they have their hand over that button, then they can very quickly without touching the screen and having to look for the button. They can just do it instinctually, keep their eyes on the road, press that button and stop or pull over or maybe ask a remote driver to take over. So here you see on the right, the safety driver has their thumb over the door release button. So they could easily have reprogrammed in robo taxi for this test that right button. If they did that, that would be incredibly clever to click it when there's an issue, have it alert a remote driver who's waiting and have them take over the car. By the way, remote intervention, uh, Whimo has it, Zuks has it, all the self-driving robots have, everybody has it. So, the question is when do the question now becomes, if you really want to understand what's going on here, is when will this be good enough to take out the safety monitor?\nI'm going to guess 6 months, 12 months, somewhere between six and 12 months a safety monitor can come out. Uh and then in some markets they might say you know what safety monitor needs to be safety driver, move them from the righthand seat to the left hand seat.\nUh and the local regulation will be local regulation, and there are going to be local regulations that say my guess is you have to have lidar, that's the standard. There'll be other jurisdictions that say, \"Hey, Tesla's approach is just fine.\" And as a startup, you when you're releasing a new product have to deal with customers, press uh and regulators. All of these folks are going to be giving you a real thorough examination here.\nThe business landscape is so chaotic right now. You got tariffs, you got supply chains, everything just keeps shifting constantly. Your company needs to adapt in real time to all these changes. So to do that, you need total visibility. That's why you need Netsuite by Oracle, your AI powered business management suite. It's trusted by over 42,000 businesses. You have the visibility and control you need to make quick decision. For example, automated payment tracking so you can see which clients are up to date and who's overdue. Revenue recognition, automatically tracking everything to make compliance a snap. lead to customer conversion and CRM follow-up so you can make your funnel tight. And with AI embedded throughout, you can automate a lot of those everyday tasks, freeing your team to the more important higher level work. One system giving you full control so you can tame the chaos. And all of the startups we know that have gotten to scale use Netsuite. So here's your call to action.

That's netsweet.com/twist.\nThe press, I think, is uh mixed on this. They they in some ways are going to be skeptical, and in some number of them don't like Elon because of politics. Uh the regulators, I think, are going to think about safety. Some of them might be politicized as well, but generally they are risk averse, and then customers, there'll be some customers who are not fans of Elon and then some customers who are super fans. So the data we're getting right now is super fans and a jurisdiction that is pro self-driving and pro innovation and a press that's a mixed bag. So what you have to do when you sort all this out is examine the videos for yourself. And if you examine, you watch these videos understanding they were taken by super fans, it's still very impressive. They're able to do the majority of the rides, overwhelming of majority of rides without an intervention. That doesn't mean you can put a 100,000 of these on the road because I know this having been an early investor in Uber. You might have heard regulators play a big role in all this. Regulators play a big role.\nBut one more data point, Jason, that you didn't mention, and it's our favorite one. What does the stock market think about this? Well, the stock market is uh pretty freaking excited.\nTesla's up like 10% today. And keep in mind, guys, for a stock trading around the trillion dollar mark, that means a hundred billion in fresh value. That's a lot of that's an enormous amount of money. That's a third of OpenAI in a day because this went well. So, there was quite a lot writing on it. And I think it went better than I expected. I mean, this is hard. This is a hard challenge. There's been no collisions. No one's gotten hurt. One or two small mistakes, but I mean, like I mean, we didn't expect it to be perfect from day one. Cuz then if it was perfect, why have all the uh the most Yeah. The most cynical take you could have is, oh my god, on the first day, and I saw this from like super cynical. Oh, on the first day it missed a turn and drove into oncoming traffic. Technically true, but it's this is not without a drive, without a safety, without safety uh monitors slash drivers, and so you know you're going to have these, Whimo must have had these when they had safety drivers, you just didn't hear about it, and by the way, I've been in Ubers and lifts where they've done you know much more dangerous things than that one instance, you could be like, oh my god, on the first day they already had one of these uh this is going to be the nature of it, every city they go to they're going to have hundreds of these interventions that'll be necessary, the question is how quickly can you get rid of the edge cases is and then the big one's going to be the LAR debate. I predict that the LAR debate now becomes real if there are more instances of interventions during fog, rain, nighttime, whatever fog and you know things where LAR might be able to see better than cameras. That's going to reinvigorate that debate. Regulators are going to get involved in that debate. I think it's going to be 50/50. Some jurisdictions are going to say you have to have LAR. It's just a prediction. Um, and I don't know which ones it will be, but I think the ones that are most conservative will say put some LAR in it, and you know that'll be an easy concession for Tesla to make. I think I think it'll be conservative in terms of like their approach to self-driving, but also just weather. Like I bet you where there's a lot of snow, a lot of ice, a lot of fog. Like if you're in Minnesota in the winter, I I I hope you have every type of radar known to man because it's a mess. I mean, it's like, you know, 15 below zero and snowing. So there, I would like everything in Austin. Cameras sound fine. So I wonder if there'll be some just straight up geographical differences as well that come into play.\nUh question for startups though Jason because I'm thinking a lot about Tesla here uh joining the market a little bit late, kind of like how Ramp did compared to Brex, and Ramp was dismissed originally as kind of a clone, a copycat, a Johnny come lately, and it has absolutely stormed the gate, and now I would say Ramp is ahead of Brex, so being second is not the worst thing in the world. Tesla's come here after Whimo already reached scale, what's the best playbook for founders who are coming into market not first but second and want to grab market share and really not fall prey to incumbency bias in the market?\nIt's a good question. Um I think if your product or solution is better, you can trump it why. Uh and you know compare the two.\nYou don't have to um and you can beat people on price, performance, speed, you know, many different vectors depending on, you know, uh choice. So, if you're Uber Eats coming after Door Dash or Postmates coming after Door Dash, whatever it is, or Door Dash coming after Postmates, having an exclusive uh being in a region they're not. So, Lyft's specific strategy versus Uber in the early days was to go to the cities where Uber wasn't. So, why even bother competing? I think that's actually might be a really power move by Tesla is to say, where is where isn't Whimo? A Whimo isn't in these Florida cities. Great. Florida is a freedom state. What are the freedom states?\nYou know, perhaps right leaning and which ones have um you know, don't have ways yet. That might be the zig where they zag and be the first mover in those markets.\nRhode Island.\nRhode Island.\nSure. Uh I think the Northeast will be one of the last.\nI know.\nYeah. Anything Anything with snow I think is going last. Anything with uh roads that are not a grid system. So roads that were created in the 17th, 18th century versus the 19th, 20th century, dang it.\nYou know, which would be Europe, you know, like you want this thing in the back streets of some southern France town or in Spain, you know, twisting around like those would be the final bosses.\nYeah.\nAnd then as a a town with inclement weather and old roads, if you took those vectors, when was the city designed?\nMhm.\nRight. Is it an old city or a new city? And then perfect weather versus not perfect weather. It's why California, Arizona, Texas, a lot of these cities expanded in the modern era with grid systems, planned communities, wide roads, there's plenty of space, and you don't, it rains 10 days a year.\nUh, and these, you know, there is a chance these will pull over and not be available in certain weather conditions. Just like when you have a blizzard in New York\n\n\nDon't expect to get an Uber because they don't have snow tires and they're just not available. And everybody in New York has adapted to that. If it's a snowstorm and you know the sub, you take the subway, that's it. Your choices are limited. I have a message here for the CEO of Tesla, which is if you can put a rocket up and catch it again, you can make this work in Rhode Island. Come on down to Providence. I'll be your first tester. I would love this. Someone please come to my city. Jason, the other big picture I think here to look at is there's no reason to rush. Sometimes people startups and founders get a little bit edgy about losing market share and having to catch up and they think they're in a race with a competitor when in fact you have to actually really assess where the race is. The race we're talking about here is car ownership versus non-car ownership. It's not a self-driving race. So, let's just pause and understand the game you're in. There's a really interesting concept of finite games versus endless games, right? Finite versus endless. A finite game, there's a winner and a loser, right? And you play and it's miserable and you don't enjoy it until after it's over and you've either won or lost. And when you win or lose, then you have, you know, uh, this moment in time where you feel great and then, you know, afterwards it kind of sucks. You know, other games like, you know, when I go skiing, skiing is an endless open-ended game. It's not a finite game. I can ski many different mountains around the world. I'm not skiing against anybody. And it's the enjoyment of the game. Here, if you think you're in a race, it's going to be miserable. If you're, you know, it's Whimo versus Uber and Lyft or, you know, Whimo and Uber versus Tesla versus Zuks. What you're really in a race here in this infinite game is car ownership. And in that way, everybody's on the same team. Zuks, Uber, Lyft, Tesla, they're actually all on the same team. And right now, that team has one point. The other team has 99 points. So now we get into the finite game. It's an infinite game there. People can take an infinite number of rides and will if the price keeps going down. So if you frame it like that, then it's car ownership. And Tesla becomes a very interesting company, right? Because they are still selling cars. So car ownership matters to them, but they also see the future and they're disrupting themselves. So now you get to the concept of the innovator's dilemma. The more successful Tesla is, the more people need to buy their cars. Inbound 2025 is almost upon us, featuring a lineup of visionary leaders and personalities who are going to transform your entire approach to doing business. There are lots of big names in this lineup, including Daario Emodi of the Breakout AI company and TWiST500 member Anthropic. And we use Claude every day. This company is making amazing strides and you just know Daario's got some great insights to share at the event. So that's going to be a awesome keynote and this is how you level up as a founder by learning from the people who came before you and soaking up all that experience and just downloading all that wisdom. We talk about this all the time. There's no substitute for being in person. The era of work from home and from remote hiding in your bedroom that's over. It's time to get back out there. So if you want to connect with visionary leaders and personalities like Daario, Victor Riparbelli, Dharmmes Shaw, my friend, and more, you have a chance at Inbound 2025. That's right, the epicenter of tech innovation is happening this year from September 3rd to 5th in San Francisco, California. Use the code twist 10 at checkout to get 10% off general mission tickets at inbound.com/register. That's inbound.com/register. So, one side of their business, the balance sheet of buying cars with young people might go down because riding in cars is going up. Uh, riding in ride sharing. I think we're going to get to 20% of rides will be done in a robo taxi, a Zuk, a Whimo, an Uber, a Volkswagen, a Tesla within 10 to 15 years. I think it could be 20% of rides. And um if that happens that means you need much less cars many many fewer cars will be needed many fewer will need to be produced which means an environmental basis you know I think we make 50 I think it makes 70 million cars a year globally and I'm pretty sure um you know it's a good job for producer what I'm pretty sure um you know Toyota and Volkswagen are you know your main players there and the Chinese are coming on strong I think they're exporting about 5 million million cars a year now, which 94 million cars made per year as of 2024. Okay. Okay, great. Yeah, I have all data. It was 70 million was my old number. So, yeah, let's let's call it we're, you know, getting close to a 100 million cars a year. You you're for each percentage point of ride sharing, you know, you're talking about 10 million cars. It's going to be a lot of cars need to be dedicated to this, but at some point there are enough. So if we all of a sudden could redirect all hundred million towards ride sharing, I think it'd be the end of car ownership, but we can't. There'll probably be 1 million or two million of these created per year out of that 100 million and then it'll get to three or four and five and six million per year and uh we'll be off to the races. Volkswagen made an announcement last week that they're going to sell ID buzzes with self drive full self-driving to anybody who wants to buy them. This is a real shot across the bow of Tesla and the entire industry. And then Whimo announced that they're giving their software to Toyota and you'll be able to buy a Toyota robo taxi. So now you'll have really three players you can commercially buy as a consumer a self-driving car from. So you could own it and sleep in it. Very interesting um how this chessboard's going to go. But again, the the great part about this game is everybody who is on the side of non-car ownership has an opportunity to win big. Uh let's move on. Jason, you wanted to talk about this really interesting job posting from our friends over at Kora. But if you don't know what Kora is, it's a well-known online question and answer service. Jason, but the second act of the company most recently is a thing called PO. It's a service that allows you to interact with a great number of different chat bots. Uh users can pay between $5 and $250 a month for PO to get more credits to use more AI models. Seems to be doing quite well. Uh but we're curious today about a new job posting from Adam D'Angelo and this is for a new role that he says is quote a single engineer who will use AI to automate manual work across the company and increase employee productivity. You thought this was incredibly interesting. Why did it catch your eye? I think somebody's going to figure out um how to manage an entire company by AI. In other words, uh AI CEO. So, here we are with producer Claude introducing it this week. Hey, this is an important role. How can we train the AI to be a real time producer? In fact, you know, my long-term goal for producer AI is to have it listening to the show. a year from now, I'd like producer Claude to be able to interject and maybe put data points on the screen without us asking. So, it anticipates. So, I say, \"What's the market cap of Volkswagen?\" And all of a sudden, just producer Claude comes along in a in the bottom, puts it there. Eventually, it could be an avatar. It could talk to you, but you know, maybe not breaking in, but just slow and then fast. So, when somebody like Adam who is deep in the AI game and Kora, my understanding is they're doing a ton of licensing and training data, they're in a really good place. uh and we saw scale AI bought by Facebook doing like a train and data company. I think Kora kind of falls into that category as well. Uh when you see the founder saying I need somebody to examine every single function or role and have it uh you know attacked by AI relentlessly ripped apart and automated. This goes back to the blog post I wrote automate, delegate, deprecate. And then I wrote a blog post this weekend on Sunday. I shipped it on Saturday or Sunday uh about just hey, we don't talk about job destruction anymore. So here when you look at the responsibilities develop and maintain internal tools and systems to automate existing work and increase employee productivity that is the high order bit. What that means is what are the employees working on that are chores that are not the main thing that we can take away for them away from them and instead of having employees do this you have an outsider an agitator coming in and saying I looked at what you do and I've automated it. So an individual will never uh automate themselves. Why? There's going to be some natural fear that they'll automate themselves out of a job. Uh they'll be they're too busy to do it. they'll be they lack objectivity. They think that there is something special about what they do, right? Um and so the unique thing about this is that they are an outsider watching people work and eliminating work, taking things off their plate. So I anticipated this. I've been talking about it. And when you see CEOs do this and then you see the reaction, I don't know how many millions of uh views that tweet got uh that post on X got, but I'm going to guess millions like two or three million people probably viewed that cuz I saw a number of other CEOs re quote retweeting it like I did and saying everybody should have this position internally. In fact, last week I asked the team to start thinking about a growth and automation position here at the firm. So instead, because you know, not everybody knows how to build these tools or likes building them to just look at every function and uh figure out how to grow that function and uh make that function more automated. As an example, when a founder sends us an update, we have a tool that reads the updates, looks for the important data in it, like what's their burn, what's their revenue, what's their growth, and then try to map those to fields in a database and write summaries. Founders will write us, god bless them, a,000 2,000 words of which we have to scan that email and get the top five or six data points. And if those data points aren't in it, the next phase of that tool will be to reply to the founder and say, \"Hey, this is the launch AI bot. Can you give us the last three months of revenue, the last three months of expenses, and then the last three months of burn, which is those two numbers subtracted from each other?\" And uh can you tell us the headcount because we don't have headcount in here. And can you tell us the cash in the bank? So, we need to get those numbers to anticipate fundraising. And we are going to have the bot in the next iteration not just take the update they send us by email typically or sometimes they'll send us a notion page or a docu a docu send you know we're going to uh do it that way. So uh that is I think the big um innovation here is that an outsider is going to do it. Be scared folks. If your job is easy to do be scared. I'm inviting you to be scared. So to answer your earlier question, Jason, 1.4 million views on that tweet. So that's uh a lot on X. Yeah. And also I just thought your point about not everyone knows how to use these systems was actually really dead on because one thing that surprised me when I was reading the uh requirements for this job at Kora, they want five plus years of quote experience in full stack development with strong skills in Python, React and JavaScript. And they want experience creating LLMbacked tools. So this is not a job for someone who is just an AI enthusiast. This is for an AI engineer, which I think is where we are today. Probably in a year it'll be easier to fill with a lower technical requirement. But the thing that I'm really curious about is what stage of a startup is the right one to bring someone like this on? Because if you're two people, you don't need one. If you're 2,000 people, you should have one. So Jason, just in your thinking, when is the startup big enough that it should have someone dedicated internally to beating back at croft and uh and delay, the founders should know how to do this. And when you get to, you know, scale, maybe 10, 20, 30 people, yeah, having somebody do this sounds like a the best possible use uh of your capital because what you have to ask is how much more efficient will this person make the organization per year? I'm going to guess they make the organization 10% better per month, but I'll put it at but 2% better a month. Can an AI optimizing person make the organization 2% better a month is your calculation. 2% compounded for 12 months. You know, that's obviously a bit more than 24%. I don't know what it is. Uh, great one for Claude to do for me off the top of my head. 27%. Perfect. So, you're 27%. Okay. So, if you had five people, you'd be in the black. If you had 10 people, that's only 10% of your revenue to make everybody else 27% more effective. Oh lord, you get that 17% spread if they were in fact 10% of your uh spend. And it might be you're spending on other things besides just salaries, but on a salary basis it would be 10%. It might be 5% of your overall spend or 7%. You know, usually staffing is 2/3 of a startup's expense or any companies in tech. So um this is a big deal. I think this is the future and I think job displacement and doing more with less is a trend that is accelerating. When Andy Jasse wrote his note last week, did we talk about that on Friday? We did. Sure. We did. Okay. Um I got so many podcasts I'm doing. I did Twitter on Sunday and talked about it all day and all in it came up. Um and then I wrote this blog this Substack this week on my um Jcal from all-in list. I have a Jcal from all-in list where I'm talking about the subjects from allin and then I have the uh startups one which is just\n\n\nI think\ncalacanis.substack.com, which is where I'll talk about startup stuff. So, you know, maybe politics and think pieces on one and just straight up startup news on the other, but I cross-posted it. And, um, you know, the thing in the industry is we're just not talking about the job destruction, uh, displacement, automation, however you want to frame it. You can frame it how you like. What you can't do is deny it's happening. And I, I felt the need to write this piece because people are specifically telling me to stop talking about this. Whenever somebody tells me to stop talking about it, I do the opposite. I lean in. So when people are like, \"Hey, don't talk about Trump and tariffs. Don't talk about job displacement. Don't talk about crypto and scams. We're all making money,\" then I talk about it more. That's just who I am. So, uh, you know, I talked about crypto and the crime and the and, you know, all that stuff 10 years ago, and for the last 10 years, I talked about Tether, human trafficking, whatever the issues are, uh, around these issues. I'm going to talk about this one. If you don't like it, tune in to another podcast. They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, uh, they'll take you. Yeah. You can just go, yeah, listen to another podcast and they'll, they'll lie to you. The truth is, this is going to be the fastest job destruction in human history. The fastest job destruction in human history. So what one must do in this situation, Mhm, is just understand that's happening and think about the opportunity. The opportunity is there will be many, many white-collar individuals and many blue-collar individuals, and I, I'll say entry, uh, rung in, you know, jobs, people who would have taken the entry-level jobs, the, the bottom-of-the-ladder jobs, dishwasher, uh, greater at Walmart, the least qualifications necessary, the lowest paying jobs in the world, picking strawberries, driving an Uber, whatever, the least amount of skill you need, uh, and the least credentials, those jobs go first. At the same time, management and white-collar jobs that are not highly technical or highly human, they're going to go as well. And so here we are, folks, the opportunity is for startups that use that surplus. There will be a surplus of humans available. The white-collar ones should start companies. The blue-collar ones should also start companies. If you're a blue-collar worker and you can get 20 people together, you know what's not going to go away? Like home repair, handyman jobs, gardening, like those jobs are very intricate and difficult and nuanced, and you can learn anything. Long story short, huge opportunity coming for all this surplus.\nAbsolutely.\nUh, just one last question on this because I was really trying to think about the future of this. So, how do you measure ROI inside of a company that's trying to automate tasks? Is it just like how much slower your hiring ramp is because people are freed up to do more? Is it your software spend you might be cutting out? How do you make sure that you're doing this intelligently to actually move the company forward versus being performative about it?\nPrevious cost versus current cost. Previous time to complete task versus current time to complete task. And you really have to be monitoring those things. As an example, when we would have an application for funding or we would get like an update from a founder who we'd already invested in, these were 30 to 60-minute endeavors.\nOkay.\nNow, with AI summarizing a deck, AI summarizing an email, AI putting the data from those two things into the database to start, you take out about 80% of the work because a lot of it was manually saying this is a SAS company, this is a marketplace, this is a fintech company. This is a company that's raising a series A. This is raising a seed. A lot of times they'll just tell you, I'm raising a seed. I'm raising a series A. Uh, where's the Crunchbase link for this? Where's the LinkedIn for these founders? A lot of this stuff can be done with AI. And so how much time were you spending on it previously? What are you spending on it now? And then times the number of times you do that task. We have 20,000 applications for funding. If you save 20 minutes per application, that's 40,000 minutes a year.\nThat's a lot, you know.\nOh yeah, that's almost 1,000 hours. 800 hours, whatever it is. Like 800 hours. The average, um, you know, employee probably works 1,600 hours. Now technically they should be working 2,000. But we all know how this works. Some people work more. Some people work less. People have vacations. People drink a cup of coffee and hang out at the water cooler. Ballpark. That might be like half a position. When you replace half a position, then now I have redeployed in our venture fund that time, and I'm finding we have more time to talk to founders. So we started something where we're doing pods of portfolio companies. So I took 11 people, divided it by the number of active investments we have, which is maybe 250. Each person in the company has a 250-person pod, I'm sorry, 25-person pod, 20, 25 founders. They invite them every month to hang out in that pod and just give an update to their fellow founders and themselves, and we're having, I think right now, five to 10 of them show up, and we just did the first one. If the next one, 10 to 15 show up, and we grow from there, just more times of us having an opportunity to understand where the founders are at, and we were previously, you know, be looking online for that information, etc. So you can just level up, level up, level up, redeploy that time. But I don't think we'll ever hire another, I don't think we're going to hire people in relation to our portfolio size anymore. Okay, so this chart from Apollo, share of firms answering yes to the question that they have used AI tools in the past two weeks. So this is a question asked ostensibly to CEOs. Did their firm use AI tools in the past two weeks? Only 9% of them said they are using AI tools. So this to me is an incredibly low number. I, I, I would ask the question, how many, if you go to a startup, you say, how many AI tools are you using, man? If I asked one of our founders, how many AI tools, how many AI tools did you use in the last two weeks, Alex? How many AI tools can have you used?\nUh, five to 10, probably on the other side of that. Yeah, I was going to say five at a minimum.\nYeah.\nUh, and so I think I've used six or seven in the past week easily, uh, that I've, I've dipped in and out of. So this is incredibly low, but I think these might be legacy firms. I think for startups, and that is the advantage. That's the advantage for sure. This is definitely the pool of 1.2, 2 million is a large number. All I'm trying to say is that as we think about how far startups are taking this, the rest of the industry is way behind them. So there's a lot of gains coming and a lot of also, I think, startup, uh, revenue to be made because there's a lot of people in law seats to sell. So it's very, very encouraging. Now, uh, on the small team size point, uh, would you like to see Jason a list of the companies that have made the most money with the smallest staff?\nOkay, most money, smallest staff. So this is back to efficiency. Yes, I would love to see that. All right. So, let me, uh, just pull that up for you. This is a website called the Tiny Teams Hall of Fame. And I saw this and I thought to myself, Jason's going to freaking love it. So, here we are. Jason, as you can see, this is a, a tiled list of companies with essentially how big their team is and how much revenue they have generated, mostly measured in ARR. And some of the data here is a little bit dated. For example, we know Cursor is at 500 million ARR, not 200. But it goes to show just how many companies are building quite a lot with very, very few people. Magnific images, 10 million ARR, two people. Merkore, a company we've talked about on the show, 30 people, 50 million ARR. This is no longer just a proposal. This is now a reality. And I'm blown away by this data.\nPretty incredible. If you were to look at Lovable, we had them on the program. Mhm.\n17 million ARR, 15 people. A million per person. I think a million per person is a pretty, um, predictable, you know, uh, bogey. Now 200 million ARR, 20 people at Cursor, if that is true, that's 10 million per person, you know, if the average person all-in is 150, 200k per year, depending on benefits and how, you know, seniority, because remember AI employees are paid much more, so we've seen this, you know, there might be one or two people at Cursor getting paid a million dollars a year who are AI scientists, then you might have AI developers getting paid 250, you might have a product manager are getting paid 150, then you might have a bunch of people getting paid 50, 75k who are in other data labeling, you know, uh, less, uh, you know, developer tech-centric jobs, but 1 to 20 million seems to be the average. This would be great in a database to see the average and the trends, and that will be the interesting thing is where will these companies be over time? It's unnecessary to make 10 million per employee, obviously.\nSo then you have to ask yourself, is that company, if I was on the board of that company, I'd be saying, why do we have so few people? Why don't we have 20 people in Japan making a Japanese language version of this and go down to 5 million per employee? And in fact, why don't we also have a sales team in Germany and a German language version and have five people there? And what are the other markets? Why do we not have an an uh, you know, people in India? And also why, you know, don't we have uh, a training course for young people and a and an educational effort where we are have five people working on bringing this technology to uh, if it's so great to universities? And so what you just saw happen in my mind was capitalism at its best, great capitalists, great entrepreneurs. I'm not saying I am one, but, um, they will look at, oh my god, how profitable can this company be? And then when the profits come in, then you say, \"Oh, wait a second. I have product market fit. I'm profitable. How can I increase the velocity of that top line? We know that the bottom line can be profitable.\" That's what happened with DoorDash, Uber, uh, and some of these other companies. They were losing money. Robinhood was probably losing money every time they got a new customer. They were investing. And then suddenly it flips. You go out of the J curve and money starts raining down. So this is uh, going to be a great moment in capitalism where you have the luxury if you're getting profitable so early. You're going to have the luxury to say, what would we do if we could hire three more smart people in Germany? What would they do? Okay, we'd have a uh, we would start hosting a weekly in the German language Cursor webinar and we'd have an in-person, you know, Cursor Con, and we'd take Cursor Con around the world and we'd send the same team to different cities and have them train people and and buy them bagels and locks and have a great time. Uh, so you being a money printing business, you know, is great, but if you make, I mean, I can't believe I'm saying this, but if you're making, if your earnings are too great, then you're going to have to give dividends to your shareholders, buy back your shares. Incredibly boring. I would, these companies should be asking, \"How can we grow faster?\"\nYou just said music to my ears, share buybacks, incredibly boring. Agreed. Now, I ran into this, Jason, because I was reading a couple of articles, uh, one from Bloomberg, one from the Times, and both of these actually are talking about this trend of startup founders building quite a lot with very few people. So, I think the broader media landscape and the public are are catching on to it.\nWho, who wrote the story?\nUh, New York Times. And this was from Bloomberg. Yeah.\nOh, what was the New York Times story? I missed that. When was that?\nUh, the New York Times was from February 20th, 2025. It was entitled AI is changing how Silicon Valley builds startups. And then Bloomberg's is from June 20th. Silicon Valley's tiny team era is here.\nOkay.\nUh, but here's the cool thing. Jeffrey Busgang from Flybridge Capital, uh, teaches a class at Harvard, and he was telling his class that they should prompt Chad GPT to quote act as a co-founder to develop their startup ideas. And this struck me as slightly worrying, but I just wanted to get a vibe check from you. If someone came to you and said, \"Jason, uh, I'm a co-founder. Sorry, I'm a founder. I'm not a solo founder, though. I also have my AI co-founder.\" Would you laugh them out of the room or take that seriously?\nI would take it deadly seriously. Um, because it shows like some visionary lunacy that you know, when you see something odd, weird, peculiar, peculiar is like maybe a good word. The weird stuff is the most interesting to me. So, I would say, tell me more. Uh, and then people hiring agents. Remember there was a company charging 15,000 like build an agent to do this. Um, like that could be the future. The future might be, hey, we've got this clawed producer and we wanted to do really cool stuff. We need somebody to write that code and to, you know, write the prompts for us and to, to, you know, iterate on it. So there's somebody out there who is a specialist at cloth and zoom and audio and video and podcasting, and they just keep building tools, and you know, that becomes a startup in itself, or they just sell you the agent, and then your agent goes for an upgrade, like buying droids. So these might, there might be like Jawas out there doing this kind of stuff. I like it. Uh, sure, why not have an uh, an AI co-founder?\nThat you were much more positive about that than I expected, but I'm totally here for it. I also like the idea that people can create what they don't have on their own and just be a little bit less dependent on other people joining on early. So that's a good way to build more companies. Um, build a, uh, build a board member AI board member would be incredible. You know, like they're out there looking for opportunities. They know what board members ask. So I think there should, that would actually be like a really interesting tool to give to founders is an AI board member and give them like the five classical, uh, personalities of board members.\n\n\n, the venture capitalist,\nfinance person, the former CFO again,\nanother finance person, compliance\nperson, an attorney,\nuh, a former founder\nwho made it big and is now retired, a\nproduct-driven person,\nyou know, a strategic somebody who\nworks at another company that made an\ninvestment. You know, they're working at\nIntel or Microsoft, and they're venture\narm investing in your company, and that\nboard all bundled together and built out\nis reading your board deck, and you get a\npreview of the questions they might ask.\nI think you could do that today. You\ncould just take your board deck and say,\nyou know, what would board members ask\nabout these? And I wonder, I bet you\nfounders are doing that already. So, uh,\nLon just told us, producer Lawn says\nthat he had a founder university company\nin his pod that had a board of directors\nthat was entirely chat GPT. So,\napparently we're trailing founders here\nby a little bit, but I think this is\ngoing to become pretty common because\nnot every board member is so unique as\nto be unreplicable with a digital\nsystem.\n Yeah. You know, I have this\ndomain named begin.com that I was able\nto acquire, and I've been thinking about\nsomething in this zone for it, like for\nstartups, for companies like the begin,\nyou know, board, or you know, co-CEO. We\nalways talk about co-CEO being a bad idea.\nWhat if, like, was\nthe co-CEO looking at\nall the data and telling the, you know,\nCEO coach, right? A CEO co-pilot. That's\nan interesting idea. CEO co-pilot. I\nlike that.\n I like that a lot too.\nEspecially if you want to think about\nlike cyber security and compliance\nchecks and what are all the boring\nthings that you forget, but you need to\nknow as a CEO. Yeah, I dig that. Um, I\nwant to talk really quickly about, uh, one\nmore founder thing. This is a story that\nI think is pretty cool. So Jason, we've\ntalked about, uh, Mark Zuckerberg, who is\ntrying to hire over at Meta a kind of\ncream of the crop of AI talent to build\nout a new super intelligence team. There\nwas a recent story from the journal that\ncame out, and it's a bit of a retread of\nthe overall idea that what Mark's\nworking on and how much money he's going\nto spend. But what struck me is how\nhands-on, uh, Zuck is here. So he's\nactually in a WhatsApp chat with Rut\nSingh, the Meta exec in charge of\nrecruiting. Zuckerberg's reading all the\nAI papers to find out who's doing the\nwork, reaching out to their preferred\ncommunication method personally, having\nthem over for dinner at his house,\npromising unlimited compute, and he is\nstaying in the process of recruiting\nthem quote right down to planning their\ndesk locations. And we've talked a lot\nabout founder mode on the show in the\nlast year. And I don't think there's a\nbetter example of that than this because\nMark Zuckerberg is one of the world's\nrichest people. He's the CEO and founder\nof one of the world's most wealthy\ncompanies, and he is literally in there\nhandholding the recruiting process to\nget the talent that he needs. So I think\nthis shows that no one ever outgrows the\nfounder role, and also there's no work\nthat's beneath the CEO.\nIt is, um, a moment in time where there\nare people who have a, there's a finite\nnumber of people who have this skill. It\nmight be an infinite game AI, like\nbuilding tools and everything like that.\nUh, but there are a finite number of\nreally good players today, and whoever\nhas them has a greater chance of winning\na big prize. If you think the big prize\nis worth, let's call it $10 trillion.\nUm, you know, the, there's probably no\nbetter use than recruiting right now. Uh,\nif you recruit somebody who comes up\nwith the idea of how to leverage, you\nknow, Facebook and WhatsApp and\nInstagram's data to serve a, you know,\nbetter ad or a new ad format. It was\nreally questionable what the ads would\ndo on Facebook. I didn't believe that\nads would work in social because you\nwould be interrupting people's\nconversations, etc.\n Um, I thought it\nwould be really hard to do, whereas\nGoogle ads were very specific, right?\nYou type in a keyword, you know what it\nis. And I, I thought these ads would be\nnot as effective in the feed. It turns\nout I was right. They were not as\neffective in the feed on a cost per\nclick basis, on a, on a click-through\nbasis. Right? If you type in a very\nspecific keyword on Google, your chances\nof clicking the ads are very high. In a\nsocial network, you know, if you scroll\nby something, it's very low until they\nmade the ads. And it still is very low,\nbut people are in there for 3 hours.\nWhereas\non Google search, you're on there for 30\nseconds, and you do 10 searches a day,\nyou're on it for three minutes versus\n30. So, you know, there's a big\ndifference between 200 minutes or 300\nminutes in a service in three. They\nfigured out a way to make it work, and\nthey also had a lot of psychographic data\non the person, who they're friends with,\netc. Um, so I think Zuck is doing the\nright thing trying to get people to come\nwork for him. And if you were a\nfreelancer, if you, if you were talent at\nthis point in time, it would be foolish\nto not test your market value. If you\nlike had your deal a year, two, three,\nfour years ago, you probably want to\ntest your market value. Um, because the\nvalue has gone 10x in\na year or two.\nThese people are super, super\nhow, how\ncool, how cool would it be to go to Mark\nZuckerberg's house in Palamato and have\ndinner? Like, I don't know. I would\nanswer his email just for that. Uh, one\nfunny anecdote. Someone actually just\ndidn't think that it was actually Mark\nreaching out to them, and so they didn't\nrespond to him for days and days and\ndays because they thought it was spam.\nAnd I thought that was a kind of an\ninteresting, uh, problem to have if you're\nMark. Like, no, it's really me. I'm here.\nAll right. Uh, I want to do one more\nstory before we jump to our interview\ntoday. Jason, uh, just a quick note on\nan acquisition. Uh, are you familiar\nwith the company called Couch Base?\nNo. Couch Base. No. Uh,\nthat's the most\nhonest. I, I love that. Okay, so really\nbriefly, Couchbase went public back in\n2021, and they offer what's called a\nsource available. So, not open source,\nbut similar to it, uh, NoSQL database.\nThey have not done particularly well\nsince they went public, and that's why\nthey're getting sold. They're selling to\nHavlli Investments for about 24.50 a\nshare. That's 50 cents more per share\nthan they went public at. So this was\neffectively a flat IPO from 2021 through\ntoday. Um, but just some data points for\nfounders out there who are curious. What\nis the clearing price today for slower\ngrowing SAS companies? Well, the company\nhad ARR of about 250 million at the end\nof Q1, Jason. And so that means it's\nselling for about 6.5x Q1 annual\nrecurring revenue, but that's with the\npremium in the take private. So I think\nprobably like 5x, four to 5x for slow\ngrowing SAS, I think is the current\nmarket clearing price today, even with\nmarkets at or near all-time highs.\nYeah, there's a lot of private equity\nfolks looking at underperforming assets\nthat went public. Um, this has always\nbeen the case. You know, this is\nsomething that happens, uh, in public\nmarkets, and they go private, they change\nthe management typically, they rip out a\nbunch of expenses, and then they look for\nsomebody to flip it to.\n So, you know,\nit's even if your company doesn't do\nwell, uh, or is slow growth, these guys\nare growing 20% year-over-year,\nuh, 10, 20%. That's still pretty good\ngrowth. Uh, but I guess the market for\nwhatever reason doesn't believe in this\ncompany. Uh, and so taking it private is\na great way to go. Uh, and you're going\nto see that over and over again. If a\ncompany doesn't break out, you have this\nbacks stop of private equity folks\nlooking at it saying, &quot;Yeah, I'll take\nthat.&quot; And there, there have been a\nnumber of interesting companies. Dell, I\nthink, probably would be the biggest\nexample. I think that was the largest\num, the largest go private ever. I think\nwas Dell at some point, and it went\nprivate and then went public again, and\nit's obviously doing phenomenal now.\n$24.4 billion back in February of 2013.\nThat makes me feel old. I thought that\nwas much more recent. I didn't realize\nit was 12 years ago,\nand now it's worth\n80 billion, right? So, you know, it's, uh,\nit'd be interesting because, you know,\nwhen now if you go look at the max chart\nfor Dell, you know, you get a stock\nprice to 2016, which I guess is when it\ncame back out. It'd be really\ninteresting to look at its market cap\nwhen it was public, then take out the\nprivate. You could kind of try to blend\nhow much the company's been worth over\nall that time. Uh, but, you know, here we\nare. Uh, going private lets you clean up\nyour cap table, your product line, all\nof that, you know, in a very clean way.\nSo, yeah.\n All right. Now, today, Jason,\nwe have a, a bit of a, a return, if you\nwill. We're going to talk to Scott\nHickle from Throne Science. Now, you may\nrecall that Lon, myself, and you back\nin May looked at Throne Science, which\nis the company that puts a camera in\nyour toilet. And we made 1 to 7 to 500\ndifferent jokes about it.\n Yes.\n And the\nthe founder was very, very kind. He said\non Twitter, &quot;Thanks for talking about my\ncompany. I don't think you guys fully\ngot it.&quot; So, Lon said, &quot;Let's have him\non the show and ask him what we missed\nand, uh, generally speaking, take another\npractice.&quot;\n Are you saying that we ished\non the company and now we're making up\nfor it?\n Yes. I'm saying that we're going\nto give ourselves a swirly by having\nScott Hickle.\n Are you saying we're going\nto get the straight dope from the\nfounder?\n I, I'm, I'm hoping so. Scott,\ncan we bring you up and, um, we're going\nto hear all about this? Scott, there you\nare.\n I can you just give us the huge\ndump on, like, what's going on with this\nbusiness? I mean, there's you have a\ntoilet behind you.\n Yeah, this is the\noffice. I mean, what I mean, the number\nof jokes and the fundraising, what was\nthe, when you went and raised funding,\nwhat was the best joke that got that\nlanded? Who dropped the best joke?\n By\nfar my favorite, I, I could not tell you\nwho did this. I've heard 10 million of\nthem at this point, but my favorite is,\nuh, poop jokes aren't my favorite, but\nthey're a solid number two.\nPoop jokes aren't my favorite, but\nthey're a solid number two. That's\nthat's strong because you get, you got\nlayers of joke there. It's layers of\njoke. Uh, but in all seriousness,\num, how did you birth this one?\nUh, so in truth, it started as a joke. So\nmy now co-founder Tim and I met. He\nmoved to Austin back in 2021 as part of\nthe COVID exodus from San Francisco. My\nbest friend from college knew him and\nwas like, &quot;Hey, please give Tim a soft\nlanding when he arrives to Austin. I\nbrought him into a poker game, and, uh, we\nwere sitting around the poker table\ntalking about startup ideas you'd love\nto start but would not want your name\nassociated with,\nand so everyone's\npitching sex, drugs, rock and roll, vice\nindustry stuff, and Tim was like, &quot;You're\nall fools. Clearly the money is in smart\ntoilets. This is inevitable.&quot; Uh, at the\ntime his idea was a toilet seat, uh, with\na scale on it that would just weigh you\nbefore and after is kind of a vanity\nmetric. And I was like, you know, that's\nhilarious. Clearly, you would, uh, put a\nleaderboard on it, sell it into fraud\nhouses, and name that company Throne.\nSo, that was the\noriginal idea for what is now, I think,\na deadly serious invention. But, you\nknow, Tim and I joked about it for 2\nyears. We ended up working together, and\nit wasn't until 2023\nuh, when we were looking for a startup\nidea in earnest to go start something.\nUh, I called my mother, who's a\ngeriatrician. I was like, &quot;Hey, mom, is\nthere any medical utility to looking at\npeople's waist?&quot; And her response was,\n&quot;Uh, honey, uh, in the field of\ngeriatrics, there, there's a, an old joke\nthat is old people care about three\nthings and three things only, their\nkids, their meds, and their poop. Uh, as\nyou age, your gut motility starts to\nslow down. You are very aware of changes\nto your digestive system, and you, uh,\ntalk about it all the time. In fact, she\nsays, uh, she gave, she stopped giving\nher phone number to her patients years ago\nbecause they would send her so many\nunsolicited pictures of poop.\nUh, so how does the product work? Like, if\nand how did you find product market fit\nfor this specific product? And I'm, I'm\nasking this in all seriousness now.\nWe'll make more jokes after this. We had\njokes before it, but what is the reason,\nthe killer reason to invest in this\nproduct and to buy it? What is the great\noutcome here?\n Yeah, great question. Two\nanswers. The first is the health and\nwellness answer. So, there are roughly\n60 to 7 million Americans with chronic\ndigestive diseases who do not have\nanything to track those conditions on a\ndaily basis, the same way that we have\n50 devices that track sleep and exercise\nand respiratory rate and cardio, right?\nLike, I'm wearing a Whoop, I've had an\naura. Uh, there's nothing looking at gut\nhealth, urinary function, or hydration in\nthose same daily ways. And then\nultimately kind of our north star, the\nmission for us is we want to build a\nsmoke detector for colon cancer. So\ncolon cancer is the second deadliest\ncancer in the country behind lung\ncancer. And the kind of pernicious thing\nabout colon cancer is if you catch it\nearly, it is one of the easiest cancers\nto cure, right? It's a 45-minute\noutpatient procedure. You get a\ncolonoscopy, and you can make it to your\nkids' little league game that night. If\nyou catch it late, by the time it's gone\ndistal metastation, you're looking at\nlike a 15% chance of survival 5 years\nfrom now. And the crazier thing about it\nis that you have basically a 7 to 10\nyear gestation window for a polip to\ndevelop into a malignant tumor. So, if\nwe can detect it in that gestation\nperiod by looking for trace amounts of\nblood that are invisible to the naked\neye, that, that will not only improve\nhealth in the, you know, helping people\nmonitor their gut health, but ultimately\n\n\nSave lives. Scott, though, you were talking on Twitter about your fundraising, and how you guys were trying to pitch it as essentially a smoke detector for colon cancer, and also, I believe the phrase was \"whoop for your poop,\" and then you had to flip that. Can you just, uh, walk me through how VCs responded to this, and then what you had to change to make the pitch work?\n Yeah, that's so exactly right.\nSo, I think some of the most well-meaning, but ultimately unhelpful advice I got going into the fund raise was, you know, we have this long-term vision of building the smoke detector for colon cancer, but short-term, we're building \"Whoop Your Poop,\" right?\nLike the daily gut health and hydration tracker.\nAnd so, people would say, \"Start with the big vision first.\"\nAnd when you start with a big vision first and say, \"Here is this hundred billion dollar opportunity that can save tens of thousands of lives around the planet every single year, uh, you lose people's attention when you start going into, and here's how we're getting there by building this health and wellness device first.\"\nWhereas when you say, \"We're building this health and wellness device that's a multi-billion dollar opportunity because there's Whoop, and that have proven the market, and you know, Garmin and Fitbit have educated, and now one in six Americans is already using a wearable every single day.\"\nWhen you start there, and then say, \"And then, by the way, kind of the call option here is if we can build the device that also detects fecal occult blood, and that can save lives,\" that you just ending on that note is far more powerful than starting with, \"Here's the high note,\" and then, \"By the way, it kind of tapers off.\"\n All right, on that note, continue success and keep us informed.\nLet us know when the new version drops.\n Alex, Jason, thanks for having me.\n Thanks, Scott.\nAppreciate it.\n",
