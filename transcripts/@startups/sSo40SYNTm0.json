  "cleanText": "I want to make one more little point about the labor discussion because Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon, dropped a public memo yesterday, and the key quote, which I just pulled out.\nYeah, I was thinking like, Jason, it's almost like you're getting the inside scoop.\nYeah.\nUm, this is what he said about Amazon and their deployment of generative AI products.\nHe says, \"As we roll out more gen AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done.\nWe will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today and more people doing other types of jobs.\nIt's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\"\nThat to me is so yes, true.\nI mean, we talk a lot about productivity improvements, and when you have more productive individual units, you need fewer of those units.\nSo that to me is the non-doomer take though, because the doomer take is white color work's going to evaporate overnight.\nThat's not going to happen.\nThis Week in Startups is brought to you

Wilham here as well.\nHow you doing, Alex?\nI'm doing fantastically well.\nI'm caffeinated.\nI had a shirt to wear.\nI'm feeling great, man.\nBut you're still you're still on the road somehow.\nI'm on the road.\nYou can tell when I'm running out of You can tell when I'm on the road.\nI'm running out of shirts, you know.\nI' I've got to do a second laundry run.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah.\nOn this thing.\nAnd I got a little bit of a thing.\nI can't I get really upset about paying for the hotel to do my laundry.\nIt's a per piece item.\nIt's $20 for a t-shirt.\nIt's $12 for a pair of underwear.\nIt's $6 for a pair of socks.\nI'm like, you could buy a pair a t-shirt for $20.\nIt makes me a little mental.\nAnd so, yes.\nUh, I like staying at Airbnb houses.\nUh, so I'm going to be in an Airbnb in LA for the We're having a little party for the launch of the All- In Tequila on Saturday.\nOh, yeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nBut I'm not supposed to I don't think I'm supposed to actually like broadcast that too too widely.\nUm, so I didn't tweet it or anything, but um, yeah, still on the road and I'm at this conference um, which I think I can say is a CO2, you know, CO2, that big firm.\nIt's their conference, East Meets West, 150 people.\nA lot of interesting um, discussions going on.\nI did a little uh, all out panel.\nIt was me, Saxs, Brad Gersonner, and Phipe um, you know, the co-founder of Co.\nAnd uh yeah, we had a we had a big debate about uh immigration and um AI and job disruption disruption.\nAnd I kind of gave my little I don't want to say stump speech, but I gave my position of why a lifelong optimist is now doomerist curious.\nOkay.\nI'm kind of find myself like a like a hanging out with the the doomeris and and and chilling with them because I was talking to the guy from Zipline which has that incredible um drones.\nThey started with Fix Wing, but you remember Zipline and I think they're in the Twist 500 are our tracking of 500 most important private companies.\nTwist 500.com.\nLong story short, you know, he's really doing a I don't want to give any numbers, but I had a meeting with him yesterday.\nHe's doing a lot of deliveries.\nMhm.\nAnd uh you know, they have Walmart.\nHe's got a bunch of other similar customers.\nAnd Door Dash is doing their own drone delivery uh internally.\nAnd so, you know, Zipline is um No, I don't think that's it.\nIs that Zipline?\nOh, yeah.\nSo, the the video loops around and you can see the the little box there.\nSure.\nYeah.\nSo, for those of you watching, the way it works is it stays 300 m in the air or 100 m in the air, 300 ft in the air, and there's a little cargo that zips down on a tether, releases your stuff in your backyard, and then goes away.\nSo, the drone is so high and quiet, which makes it quiet.\nSo, if you have a backyard, it drops it.\nBut the pickup is really the interesting thing.\nSo, those little boxes Mhm. are um you know easily filled by somebody at a cafe or a sandwich shop, you know, pick your poison.\nUh and they're doing a lot of you know 8 pound deliveries and these things come in minutes, you know, sub 15minute time delivery.\nSo it's going to change this back to AI and and how this is making you doomer adjacent cuz I'm really curious.\nSo, automatic delivery is a big one and Andy Jasse spoke here and I got to ask him two questions and I asked him about return to work and the kurfluffle.\nRemember, there was all this kurfluffle and he said, you know, it's actually turned out to be not that dramatic because the people who we we we knew going into it we would lose people um who we didn't mind losing that weren't essential and we lose people who we loved working with, but we decided we wanted to have a certain culture.\nAnd it's turned out the culture's back at the company and so we love it.\nSo that was my second question.\nMy first one was hey job disruption job destruction disruption and retirement you know you've seen these the figure robot sorting things you have tons of robots in your factory self-driving.\nYou're doing zuks.\nIt seems to me that when a lot of those jobs go away and obviously you're not hiring a lot of people you have less people at Amazon than you did a couple years ago.\nwhat's happening in white collar.\nAnd um he was basically very upfront and candid that he did think there was going to be um a lot less people working at companies and that it was something society would have to navigate.\nYeah.\nAnd that is the tension and you know when you say that to a room full of investors and I just said you know I think we have some responsibility.\nUh I don't buy into like technology is just going to technology and let the chips fall where they may.\nI think we actually should think about it.\nI know it's a bummer, but we should think that, hey, some jobs will be disrupted.\nNow, is it our responsibility to create all the new jobs in the world?\nNo.\nNo, of course not.\nBut I think we should just be thinking it as human beings on planet Earth because there could be some disruptions and we have safety nets and the safety net used to be being a Door Dasher or an Uber driver or working at Starbucks and you know now the safety net that we created like I think gig economy work is the is the great safety net.\nWe might be looking back, remember all that hand ringing in the press and all the union leaders?\nOh my god, you know, this gig work is terrible.\nYou got to work a shift.\nYou got to come in at 6:00 a.m., work till, you know, 4 p.m., whatever it is.\nIt turns out like we're going to look back and be like, \"Wow, that that gig work was like geek.\nYou could pick who you wanted to work for.\nYou could work for three different people.\nThey were all competing with each other for your work.\nIf you didn't like working for one, the customer, you can go to the next.\"\nSo long story short, we're going to have job destruction.\nEverybody agrees on that.\nThe the only thing people don't agree on is the timeline and if we can create new jobs in that time period.\nAnd then Phipe had something you know I think I think it was Phipe who just said something really interesting about like people have to also be motivated to start jobs uh to create jobs and that's going to be very interesting I think very interesting moment in time where you know group of five 10 people like when you graduated from college or I did when I graduated there weren't a lot of jobs in '94 9293 we're coming out of like um a recession and everything some people didn't get jobs they just stayed at home I think That might be a trend that we're going to see young people without jobs.\nYeah.\nSo that means we're looking at job destruction now from two different perspectives because we talked a lot on the show Jason about our concern that AI is going to automate early career positions in law and programming and other kind of like knowledge heavy industries.\nBut now if we take away the gig economy safety net as well, I mean that does really give people right out of college or just right out of high school, frankly, a pretty limited set of gigs.\nThat's that's worrying.\nWell, and that's happened to white collar, too.\nSo, you know, we we've seen in big tech that they're like, \"Yeah, we're not going to hire young people because we don't have to we don't want to have to train them.\"\nAnd the time it takes to train a young person versus the time it takes to automate some amount of work at your job, just might be easy to automate it.\nSo I think this is the tension that's going to become very real in the next you know five years over the next 5 years and so anyway don't have solutions but that means there's a job that means there's an opportunity if there is surplus cognitive surplus white collar and there's physical surplus people doing things in the real world moving atoms moving bits if you had a surplus of young people what could you do with them what could you do with them that would be a creative I don't All right, founders.\nLet's talk about your website.\nI know, Disclad.\nYou're ashamed of your website.\nI know.\nWell, it's time to clean it

the national parks and forests.\nWe could use a lot more painters.\nI don't know.\nBut nothing that's like plus GDP really comes to mind.\nMaybe we just say teachers work 4 days a week.\nthey get the fifth day to do professional development or recover from teaching and you I'm sorry to sound like a socialist but you just increase the number of teachers 20%.\nSo maybe like if every teacher took off Friday Mhm. and just back of the envelope math to make it easy for people to understand my my point here.\nIf every teacher took off Friday and had a professional development day, right, uh to research stuff, whatever u or maybe do one-on-one tutoring, then you need theoretically 20% more tutoring.\nSo you hire, you know, whatever, a science person who rotates and takes the kids, you know, uh, 20% of the kids each day or maybe just take class sizes from 30 on average and make them 15.\nYep.\nThere are 3.8 million public school teachers in the K through2 system today.\nSo if we can make that 5 million and get class sizes done, that'd be tremendous.\nUm, I want to make one more little point about the labor discussion because Andy Jasse, the CEO of Amazon, dropped a public memo uh yesterday and the key quote, which I just pulled out.\nYeah, I I was thinking like, Jason, it's almost like you're getting the inside scoop.\nYeah.\nUm, this is what he said about Amazon and their deployment of generative AI products.\nHe says, \"As we roll out more gen AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done.\nWe will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today and more people doing other types of jobs.\nIt's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\"\nThat to me is so yes, true.\nI mean, we talk a lot about productivity improvements and when you have more productive individual units, you need fewer of those units.\nSo that to me is the non-doomer take though because the doomer take is white color work's going to evaporate overnight.\nThat's not going to happen.\nNo, it's you know there you're going to need less people because people will do more.\nThat's the upside.\nThat's what could save the entire economy.\nyou know, the the the idea that we've had so much disruption geopolitically, tariffs, you know, the Israel bombing Iran, that conflict, um, you know, all this type of chaos we're seeing, immigration, whatever, uh, changing in the United States here.\nUh, everybody knows my feelings on that.\nAnd the stock market continues to rise.\nSo, you know, putting aside the the the freedom day or whatever that, you know, shocking and bore wound up being, you know, shocking 150% tariffs, then bore, we just want reciprocal.\nYou know, that's the standard playbook for negotiations\n\n\nWith Trump. Shock and bore. It's like crazy shocking. And then it's like, okay, this is kind of boring. We can just not pay attention to it. Uh, it's not going to be impactful in a major way. Like, it's not going to be disruptive. It could be impactful, but not disruptive, I think, would be the fair way to say it. Yet, here we are.\n\nThe stock market keeps climbing and the Fed's not cutting rates. So, they kind of have a perspective, too. Yeah. So, their perspective is economy's good. Economy's good. Uh, I checked the data this morning. According to Fed Watch, no one's pricing in rate cuts until September, at which point investors are a little split between a 25 or a 50 BIP cut, which is 0.25 or 0.5%. But yeah, it's going to be static for a while. I just find it very surreal to your point that my family's net worth is probably at an all-time high. And yet when I read the news it's like the world burns down again and I'm like, oh, okay, I guess. So weird. Yeah, you know, split screen.\n\nHere's a poly market fed rate decisions. Yeah. So June, July 30th, September 17th. Am I on the right thing here? Let's see. Fed decisions. Fed rates. Yeah. So here. Let me uh, I have a bigger, better screen for that. Sure. I got it. Yeah. So 55% chance no change in September and everything else is uh, 41% 25 bips. So, you know, we're basically now down to 50/50 on the screen shared. I want to show you something funny. Yeah. Okay. So, um, Poly Market, I prepared a different Poly Market for today, but we're doing this early, so this is totally fine. Um, so I just pulled up the same page and look at what they've put. They actually literally have the live stream from the Fed Open Markets Committee on the page for I love that. Yeah. You know, it's kind of working back from, you know, you and I were talking about how journalism is changing. Um, you know, and I, I jumped off the journalism boat a little earlier. Uh, you're still like half journalist, you know, um, and uh, half entrepreneur. Now, I think like this is part of the future of journalism, which is starting with every placing a bet and saying, here's my skin in the game. Yeah. And then uh, you know, placing, you know, literally putting skin in the game and then working backwards to the discussion. And so if you think about that versus traditional journalism, and again, I'm not here to beat up journalism, the world evolves. You know, when you see people talking about sports, now they're talking about their wager on the sports on ESPN and giving their position, having a bet, and then they watch the game, and then during the game, they're talking about maybe changing their wagers or how the odds have changed. So if you just think about what are consumers wanting from media, I think they want, despite all the fake news and you know, all the, you know, everybody's terrible at this job or whatever, there's a group of people who are saying, hey, we're going to make some hard decisions, put skin in the game, and we have a more interesting way of getting you the news. Podcast is one of that groups, that's why I'm always trying to make this podcast better. When we cover companies, Alex emails them. True. Emails the CEO and says, \"Hey, we're covering you today. Here's two questions.\" And that's why we get inside information because we literally just do this old school thing of doing that. But we also talk about bets and we, we make bets on this program, although we have to do better at following up on those bets. I need all the Sunny Bets looked up, editorial director, and so we can maybe settle some of those. Okay.\n\nAnyway, your thoughts? You had something notes? Got some notes? No, no. I'm just, I'm enjoying uh, the discussion of how things are changing in regards to journalism because one thing I'm still wrapping my heads around my head around is simply the power of industry insiders who are conflicted to have an enormous media position discussing not just their industry but the industry at large and I, I that is so antithetical to the way things were done in the 80s, just to roll the clock back far enough to be uncontroversial that I don't think we fully digested what that means for truth telling, but I do agree that it is incredibly popular, impactful, and people do find it useful. So, I think we are going to see more hybrid stuff. Um, speaking of which, did you see that? Just to build on that position. Good position. Um, it used to be if you wanted to tell your story, you were Andy Jassy, you had to, or you were Jeff Bezos, you had to go to the New York Times or Wall Street Journal, give them the story. They interpreted what you said and then they put it out there. And in the best case, you felt like, okay, yeah, that was, that was fair and balanced. In the worst case, you felt like they spun it and had a position they were going for and it depended on the publication, depended on the journalist. And over time, people felt like maybe it wasn't balls and strikes. So, they went direct. So, now you have direct podcasts with the principles on it. And you know, like if you watch Allin uh, and the four of us are talking, we're talking our book by default. The audience understands that. If you look at like the back channel, they're like, \"Okay, David Sax works for the, you know, for the administration, so he's going to be in solidarity with them. That's how it works. You know, Chimath has these investments. Jason has this investments. Freeberg Samantha Science has this uh, you know, uh, Oh company. Uh, and so I think the audience is saying, I understand the conflicts. I'm willing net to take that. I think ultimately where it winds up is a hybrid. I think it's a hybrid. You know, I agree. But if you think back to when blogs were new, like literally back when web blogs were still called that, I remember when a company would open a blog, people were like, \"What? They're just going to like post on it and write things. Well, to today, I for my newsletter and for the show pulled up the Amazon, sorry, the about Amazon web page to read the memo from Andy Jassy directly. I did not need an intermediary. And that's kind of the gist of what we're talking about. Probably because he doesn't want to be interpreted. He wants to be taken at his word because he feels this is super important. So that's actually a really important insight. And I asked Steve Jobs, why don't they blog at Apple? like a famous clip from the D conference. The Wall Street Journal had a conference called D back in the day with Walt Mossberg and Caris Fischer. And I was but a, you know, 30-year-old uh, you know, running web log sync, I think at the time, and I asked him like, why don't you blog? It takes too much time and then people are going to say stuff and it might not be in sync, so yeah, it's not for us. But now you see people going direct and now you start to see podcast. I saw the Carlson brothers, the Stripe, speaking of startup Stripe, launched their own conversations. I think Cloner Perkins just launched a blog. I'm like, my god, how many blogs are there? Like, does anybody get any work there in this industry? Pretty crazy.\n\nYou know, here at This Week in Startups, we try to keep founders just up to speed on all these trends in AI and marketing, but we can't do it alone. But you're also going to need to connect in person with their colleagues and partners and innovators. There's no substitute for in-person. So if you want to connect with visionary leaders and personalities like Daario Amodi, Victor Riperbelli, Dharmmes Sha, my friend, and more, your chance is to do that at INBOUND 2025. That's right, the epicenter of tech innovation that will help you transform your strategy as we approach the AI era. It's happening this year from September 3rd to 5th in my old hometown of San Francisco, California.

Well, if we're going to do that, here's a website for you, Jason. Here's this from OpenAI, introducing the OpenAI podcast from 3 hours ago. So, yes, everyone is now doing this. I think probably because Sam Altman just wants to be able to kind of like not answer the same three questions 10,000 times, but I think it's going to become the norm. The question is, what's the first company with its own podcast, media publication, stable coin? Yeah, every meme everything. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, well, you know, we'll see who keeps publishing. You know, that was always the interesting thing. People underestimate the amount of work. Oh yeah. That it takes. And here we are, 2,000 episodes into This Week in Startups, three days a week, and I just, I'm a machine about it. You know that. Uh, you work with me. So I think a lot of people will just give up because it is arduous to put on a performance, you know, every day or every other day. I do four days a week, you do three. Like, it's, it's not easy. It's not easy to have that kind of consistency as a player. So all right, what's in the news? Let's get back to the news now. Here we go. All right. I want to talk about a couple of TWIST 500 companies that are in the news. First up, Pano AI is a company that I added because I thought the bet that we could use AI to detect wildfires was a pretty good one. And what they do, Jason, is they put the cameras on top of like cell phone towers. And then during the day, Pano AI looks for essentially smoke. And at night, it looks for heat. And the idea is what if we could just better detect and track wildfires much more quickly and easily. I put them on the TWIST a little while ago. The latest news is that they have raised a $44 million series B led by Giant Ventures with participation from both Initialized Capital and Salesforce Ventures. They're selling Jason to people that you love, including private uh, ski resorts and landlords. So, your two favorite things, owning ranches and going skiing, and also of course, governments and utilities. The key thing here that I'm really excited about is not that they raise money. That's cool, but not really proof of progress. Uh, the journal wrote that they have now reached contracts exceeding $100 million, which I think shows strong early commercial momentum. Yeah. Um, and you can see it there on the screen if you're watching. It's, you know, very simple. It's um, you know, a camera high up and a bunch of software on the cloud. You think about how much it costs to deploy this. you know, these cameras are probably, you know, commercial grade, couple of thousand dollar cameras. Um, I'm sure they make them pretty rugged because of where they're located. Um, and then a, a pretty good connection, but you know, 5G exists everywhere. And um, this is I think, you know, probably what people are underappreciating about it because I'm sure people were putting up cameras uh, and looking for smoke previously, you know, but here if you look, it's showing you like where you have transmission lines and main lines and um, the wind speed, wind gusts, temperature, humidity, and then what assets you have. Right. So when it shows a fire here, it's showing on the screen like, oh, there's a Valley Ford fire. It also has two nearby assets and it's 1.2 million to the closest asset. An asset, I'm assuming here is something to put out the fire. So what we and we're thinking about Jobs, right? To our early part here. This will be a complete closed loop system shortly. I brought up Zipline before, the power of drones. There is literally going to be helicopters or drones that have large water payloads that are going to be able to go out without waking somebody up in the middle of light. Firefighters not going to be able to need to get their gear on and and run out to this fire. They're going to have a drone go. First drone's going to go and get above the fire and just monitor it. Right? So now you got a quadcopter. Second drone quadcopter is going to get out of the way or film from a distance is going to drop a payload of water or fire retardant on these things. The other thing that's going to happen is this is going to be doing an analysis and the AI through an algorithm instead of, you know, showing you your next video in TikTok as you're melting your brain and frying your dopamine sensors is going to say these places are where the fires keep happening. And then you're going to say, \"Oh, this place waters and has, you know, better vegetation. There's never a fire there. So over time, they're going to know exactly or this idiot keeps burning their garbage and sending embers up. The second, third order impact of this kind of a system is going to be incredibly underrated. Incredibly underrated. You're going to catch the arsonists when they know that fire. Oh, you're saying it. Well, I mean, if you have a combination of uh, a, a time series bit of information about where fires began and you cross that with GPS data from cell phone locations, you're going to be like, well, that started and there were seven people nearby and one of those phones has been near the last three hotspots and then we're going to take that person and we're going to three point them right into jail. The downside though, Jason, is that my backup career, which has always been going to sit in a Firewatch tower and not talk to humans for 10 years, has apparently now sufficiently anticated that I will not be able to do that. And that's there's a, there's a really good uh, there's a really good sitcom or short-run series here uh, of the Last Fire Warden. You know, the LA, what do they call those fire watchers? What do they do? What, what's their technical name? I, I don't, I there's got to be some great name for them for this new series coming from Calacana Studios. Uh, the story of the last Fire Watcher. Uh, and they have to shut the uh, thing down and they're fighting to keep it going, but there's a robot in there with them. There's like an Optimus or a figure robot living with them that they're training to do the job and their reward for training them is that\n\n\nThey lose their job. But then they decide that the robots would be bored and uh sad being alone. So he decides to stay anyway and he makes a business doing some other business. You know, running a campground around the Firewatch tower. And they tell stories about the old days. Lon's going to quit and go write that. Uh no, no. This is part of Lon being here. Lon is here so that we can do our creative ideas and you know, we got a secret project we're working. I vol I volunteer to be the to do this. Uh by the way, they're called fire watchers. So that's a pretty on the on the nose on the nose title. Fire watcher question to CVS. My question is what about selling to governments? Because back in the day people said don't sell to school districts, don't sell to counties. It's too slow. It's too hard. It's too painful. But here we have Pano AI which does sell the governments doing quite well. So I'm kind of curious, Jason, when is it a good choice for a startup to sell into hard markets like that? Yeah. So, we're talking specifically about our government, uh, you know, being slow and incompetent and filled with grift and fraud and stupidity and waste. We're not talking about the UAE or Singapore. Uh, and you know, if you go around the world and if you show this to people in Singapore, Singapore pays people working in government 3, 4, 500,000 a year. They are the premier employer. If you are a smart person in Singapore, you would first look for a job, not at Goldman Sachs or at Google.\nJust picking them because it's G's. You pick government.\nGovernment over Goldman and Google.\nThat's what you do in Singapore. How do they accomplish that?\nThey have created a sense of pride with working in government and a sense of like that's like um one of the most proud things you do because of Lee Kuan Yu, uh this incredible leader of Singapore and when you watch his videos of how he built that country man he's like the iron fist he built that country but one of the key things is he said the best and brightest work for. And so, you know, there's people you can sell into. There's you can go for those governments and then you can go for people who are just land owners. I heard you mention they were going after ranch owners, etc. who have to deal with fires, too. And by the way, I was spending time with Rick Caruso who ran for mayor, lost to Karen Bass in LA. Karen Bass complete incompetence to Scratziad, like the worst leader you could ever have during a crisis as we saw her like freeze up when they were just asking her questions about what you're going to do when she was on some boondoggle out of the country while the city burned. And I hope he runs again and I hope they they put him in there. But investors like me are not going to invest in your business unless you're structured properly.

He created this place in Pacific Palisades and he he came up with this incredible technique combating fire. It's almost as perhaps arguably more um innovative than Pano AI. It's called water firefighters.\nIncredible combination. So when So you have people who use water, right, to put out the fires. Yeah. So when uh you know this place I'm at, this rosewood here in the Santa Barbara area, Monteito, is gorgeous. When they had fires here, you just like they knew it was fire season, so they just stationed a couple of water trucks and then there are private firefighters you can hire. Yeah. So they were like, \"Okay, we'll hire some private firefighters. If sparks come, we can put things out, yada yada.\" And then they build things to be fire resistant. This is all just planning and will. And um so if if one government group can't do it, I like that you keep your costs low and you sell into people who are impacted by this, the insurance companies are going to love this as well because they are losing their ability to provide insurance in certain regions in America and this would bring it back. So, yeah, ski resorts would have an easy time paying for this. And I think this is a solution that's probably, I don't know, $100,000 to install five of these cameras around your ski resort, you know, and then uh maybe they charge 50 or 100,000 a year. Maybe they charge 10K a month for something like uh that. And so, you're looking at going, okay, 120k a year, a million dollars over the next 10 years. What do I save on fire insurance?\nMaybe it pays for itself.\nOh, I can easily see that. Yeah. Yeah. But uh just to underscore what Jason's saying about insurance companies having a hard time ensuring this is a data set from Noah, uh the government agency tracking billion dollar disaster events uh that are essentially driven by you know droughts, wildfires, flooding, etc. And Jason, there's a pretty clear upward trajectory to this chart. So as climate gets a little more unpredictable, a little bit more difficult, we're going to have a lot more problems. Wildfires are in this list by the way. So, I do expect uh a lot of companies to try to make insurance possible for people because if we don't have insurance, Jason, who is going to subsidize sports broadcast on cable television if it's not Geico and freaking farmers, right? Like, someone has to pay for sports. So, we got to keep the insurance companies in business. Yeah. Insurance is critically I mean, and insurance will change. So, you know, this is an interesting thing for us to discuss as we move into AI boom. AI doom. AI boom. AI doom. That's going to be our new segment. Lon, make us a jingle. AI doom or AI boom. Be like me with a devil on each side like one person on a side like it's the end of the world. The other person saying it's going to be like utopia. Um, the AI boom side of this equation is costs go down. So, if you were to eliminate wildfires as a concept, well, then insurance goes down. If you have a car that can't crash or and you reduce the ability to crash 99%, well, why do you need insurance? Or if your insurance is going to go down 99%. So, with technology, you know, we should see massive amounts of money in the economy free up. And insurance is a big giant waste of money that should go away in many cases or be reduced at least 80, 90%.\nWell, you're saying that if you can reduce the underlying risks that make insurance a requirement, then we don't have to have that essentially risk rent on the economy. I mean, do you have insurance for um you know, I don't have ski insurance as an example? I mean, I have health insurance, but I don't have like insurance on my skis, you know, breaking or something. I don't have insurance on like this laptop breaking. Now, they upsell me on like get the insurance and laptop breaking. I'm like, I replace it every 3 years. The chance of it breaking is very low. They make these things like, you know, remember everybody used to get for their phones insurance for the screen breaking. And then Gorilla Glass, you can literally drop your phone 10 times and it will not break. I mean, don't do that with an old phone. It will break on the first try. And literally for young folks with your iPhone, you paid $100 insurance when you bought it and you got one break and then they would you go to the store and they would replace it. Now, it was worth it. It was worth it because you were it was going to slip out of your hands and you break it. Now, I mean, I I kick my phone across concrete all the time. I'm distracted. It's breaking. And you know, I get little chips in it, but I've never broken the glass. When's the last time the glass broke on an iPhone? Hasn't happened to me. Three phones ago for me. Yeah. Yeah. three or four phones ago, right? So, it's a perfect example of technology reducing expenses, making things more rugged, and we love that. What's the Reddit I always talk about? Buy it once. Uh I believe it's buy it once. Yes. The idea of purchasing a high quality thing. Although, I will say you have given Pano AI really great second act because if they do figure out this wildfire detection system and it works as well as they want and they get the coverage they hope to have, all they have to do next is just team up with a drone company and launch their own firefighting service. Like, why why not? They already have the data. Yeah, I'm sure there is somebody making drones for firefighting already. So that could be like an API call or they could just white label it or they can make it themselves. Uh it's clearly what's going to happen. Yeah, buy it for life is the Reddit by the way. Not not buy it once. Buy it for life. Yeah, great great subreddit. One more little news bit, Jason, and then I want to talk about some founder stuff, but really quickly, we've talked about Scale AI and its partial sale to Meta. We also discussed a little bit about how some of its customers might be backing away from it. Well, OpenAI said in the immediate aftermath of that deal that they weren't going to back off with CFO Sarah Frier saying, you know, we don't want to ice the ecosystem because acquisitions are going to happen. If we ice each other out, I think we're actually going to slow the pace of innovation. That didn't last. According to reporting today, OpenAI is going to move entirely away from Scale AI, which means I believe that this aqua hire of Scale's founder and some of its technology is going to pretty much kneecap the company. So I guess there's going to be a lot of talent from Scale AI that's available for other companies to hire. But it does seem a little about that. Yeah. Okay, it might be that Zuckerberg is so ambitious that he will keep everybody employed and just make his AI uh make his AI the best one. So, I think that's what's going on here. It's almost as if like you bought Nvidia and then you take all the chips. Not making less chips, going to make more chips, but nobody else gets to buy them. So obviously it's impossible to do that with Nvidia. There's so many of them. But you could imagine with Grock or an inference chip, you know, a smaller a sub10 $10 billion chip. Somebody might say, \"Yeah, I'll buy Grock for 10 billion and every single chip I'm going to take for myself.\" And yeah, if we have any left over, maybe we'll sell them. So that that could be the situation here. and I suspect it is is that Zuckerberg is now taking a Meta glasses, you know, metaverse approach to AI, which is I've got the most money and chips outside of Apple maybe and Google. Therefore, I'm playing for a legacy. I'm pushing all my chips in. He is you can say whatever you want about um you know what he's done to society and you know how he treats customers and the negative impacts of social media which are vast and we've talked about here countless times on a business basis he is a complete berserker like in the category of fighters. He will copy everybody's innovation and laugh while doing it and do it better than you because he doesn't have to come up with the original idea. He doesn't have to come up with the three ideas that don't work to get to the one original idea. He'll just copy whatever your innovations are so fast that your head will spin and then he has all that free time since you spend all the time doing the product discovery and product market fit work. He can just keep polishing your innovation.\nThen if there is a possibility that there is a disruptive technology and listen he made a mistake. Meta and VR did not disrupt anything about social media. zero had zero impact. None. So, he made a colossal mistake and burned $50 billion. It doesn't matter. That would be like me, you know, betting $50,000 or you betting $5,000. It's like, okay, I Yeah, it stings, but who cares? On to the next, right? You can make another $5,000 bet. I can make another $50,000 bet. You can make another 50 billion dollar bet. He's playing with a different chipsack. The end. You know, and I was playing low stakes poker the last two nights. I just my VPIP was 100%. I played every hand and I told everybody I'm playing every hand. I won three pots last night. 36 off, 84 off, king seven off in 84. I I got two pair on the turn after everybody was racing into an ace on the thing. The other two I hit trips as well. Every Nobody could ever imagine that somebody would be playing a three for $50 pre flop or $100 pre flop. Who plays 36? who plays 84. It's just not in the thing. I you know my my friend Alan Keading who I play with or Stanley Tang from Door Dash, you know, they have adopted this style because they have very big chip stacks. They do that in high stakes poker when you watch that Triton and stuff like that. So this is an analogy that's important. If you have a big chip stack, you're a founder and you want to really be disruptive.\nUm\ngo all in and play a lot of hands. You're playing a lot of hands and you're putting max pressure on the industry. I I I think Facebook's going to do exactly in AI what they did in social media, which is find their WhatsApp, find their Instagram, and go all in. And that's this might be the first of a couple of acquisitions that are going to happen. Well, I'll be I'll be very curious to see who they buy next as they\n\n\nPursue the Texas Mike pre-flop strategy. And if you don't get the poker references, well, that probably means you're going outside too much and touching way too much grass. So, get back to your computer.\n\nAll right. There was a really interesting story about a startup today. It's called Traversal, and it is building an AI, basically an AI agent that does site reliability engineering work or SRE work. Essentially, it looks at all your systems and helps you ensure that your company's website doesn't go down, your service doesn't go down. It's a good use for AI, and they just came out and they raised $48 million. All this is to say that they were in stealth for a long time. So long they raised their seed and a while in stealth and only are now coming out to talk to the public about this. I'm really curious about the strategy, cuz I feel like going in stealth is a very 2012 thing. So I'm curious from your perspective today, one, is being in stealth still something startups should consider? And if so, when? Cuz I was just kind of blown away by this seeming blast from the past.\n\nYeah. Okay. So, I'm going to have a weird take on this. Okay. A weird take on this. Different entrepreneurs um have different energies. There are some, I saw Adam from Kora. I've always really respected him and I've always tried to talk to him cuz I I just think he's cool. Um but he's incredibly quiet and he just stealthily operates in the world and Kora just grows. And then I was really interested in what Kora was doing. And I said, \"Hey, you know, hey, what's going on? You guys doing like X, Y, and Z. I want to say what it was.\" And he said, \"That's exactly what we're doing. We're doing X, Y, and Z.\" I'm like, \"I never hear about it.\" He's like, \"Yeah, no explanation, nothing. It's just he's quietly moving in the world like an assassin doing assassin-like things.\" Some people, that's how they're built. They're not looking to get a bunch of kudos from the world when they, you know, wake up in the morning and they show up for work.\n\nOther folks, like these build-in-public folks, um they release a new feature, they get their you know daily Stripe report or their Shopify report and it's public and you know the Buffer app guy was like one of the pioneers of this. He was showing his like actual, he made a public version of his like Stripe or whatever, and you could actually see his revenue, you could see his churn rate. Now all the statistics were great, so it was good and that made his team excited. It created excitement around his startup. People checked it out. It also inspired, I kid you not, there must be a hundred startups right now doing cross-posting uh services because it it's all vulcanized in social media and management because cross-posting and management. There were like a small number of companies that did it. It cost thousands of dollars. Now it's basically uh free, you know, like close to free. 100 bucks a month, 10 bucks a month instead of thousands of bucks a month.\n\nSo yeah, there you go. And it looks like you had a bunch of churn during uh when when did you have that chart? Was that is this a yearly chart? I'm This is um this is all time for them going back to January of 12th. And so it seems like right around two right around COVID, they had a pretty big decline, but they've since and I knew this so going in. I kind of knew what the chart was going to say. They're now at I believe an all-time AR high again. Um but what's cool, Jason, here is they didn't stop sharing it when they were here, right? That's the thing that gives me a lot of it went down. They didn't do it. Yeah. So, this like it's like a fun thing to watch along. You know, the challenge with this is he has employees. So, when an employee says, \"I need a raise. I got these other job offers.\" And he's like, \"You can't cry poverty.\" He's got to have like a really significant discussion and say, \"You know what? You're right. You're worth it.\" Or, \"You know what? I got two other people here who are, you know, half your price, so I can get two for one, so I'm just gonna stick with them.\" Or, you know what? I automated your job and you know so but this reality has always existed so in some ways your job becomes pure uh you can say to people you you can't obscurify the reality and then make that your tool for doing compensation negotiation. You could you then have to focus on reality. You're making X, market is X, US 20%. I like working with you. I'm willing to pay the extra 20% because you're awesome at your job or you you know the market is now x - 50% for your salary and I'm going to make a change because it's in the best interest of the business.\n\nSo you and I had this discussion about Microsoft cutting 3% of their employees in a record quarter with record cash in a booming market where their prospects are incredible. Like what? This is against all Silicon Valley tradition. You always had extra staff. You cherished the people who stayed with you for a long time. You wrote them letters. You celebrated their 10 year, 5 year, 20 year anniversaries. And now it's just like, yep, we're in a different. It's a different world now, folks. You're going to get cut. It's a sports team world. There's 15 seats. And as Andy Jassy said, like we're going to have less people doing more. So use AI every day. Best best advice. And white collar work is changing. You know, like if you're good on podcast, that's one thing, but you know, if you're a developer or a salesperson or customer support, you know, it's just metrics and can we automate your job? You know, I think this is why every CEO is like, please learn AI tools now cuz what they're saying is please don't make yourself the first one that gets cut.\n\nBut looping back to stealth. Some founders are quieter, moving in silence like G's and lasagna, I think, as Lil Wayne said, and some are more chess poundy. So essentially then does stealth just come down to does it fit the founders's operating ethos? Yes. If you're a founder and it gives you more energy to build in public, go for it. I don't give your entire road map. Don't talk about things you haven't done. But it does create momentum and joy and um you know with your customer base they can get more engaged, be in a community. But again just be aware that everything you're doing your competitors are copying. And in a world where software can be built pretty fast, if your buffer like that buffer chart, if he I wonder if that buffer chart would be he'd be at 100 million in re right now if he didn't inspire 10 competitors and competitors are constant. It creates downward pressure. You know people know you have a big business. I'm going to go compete with it. So if you really think you found a really great business maybe shut up. Don't sh collect the money. Do you remember when Google went public and everyone collectively crapped their pants because they're like, \"They're making how much money?\" Now, no one caught Google, but like that was, you know, ISR on saying, \"Please come here and take our business cuz we're just printing money.\" It was crazy. You want to inspire your customers, your team, build in public yourself, get stoked. Do you want to inspire competitors? Go stealth. Be careful out there, folks.\n\nThe both both I've seen both strategies work. I think over time people maybe zip it and they just do their two yearly keynotes and get into a cadence for product releases that's more like that. But we we have some high performers and I think it puts pressure on them. Uh but that since every company does go through an ass kicking at some point, you know, and this is what being public is. Being public is, if you're an IP, if you're a public company, you are building in public. It happens to be a quarterly cadence, not a weekly or monthly. So in some ways those folks are prepared for it. In in fact, I think Facebook and Uber, Stripe, some other people started doing quarterly uh releasing quarterly data even as a private company. Um or maybe not being as protective of the quarterly data, like if it leaks, it leaks. Like we're just getting prepared to be out there as a public company. So if you've raised a series G, that means gosh darn just tell me every quarter what you're doing even if you don't put it through an SEC filing.\n\nUh, we do have an office hour today, Jason. But I want to squeeze in one more thing because Tik Tok is the popular vertical short form video application. It is the brainchild of ByteDance, a major Chinese private technology company. Never heard of it. Never heard of ByteDance. Oh man. We know it. We know it. Uh, Congress passed a divest or get out law earlier this year. President Trump came into office. He has delayed that not once, not twice, but now three times, giving another 90 days on this deal. Uh my understanding, Jason, is that Tik Tok and its future in the United States has become wrapped up inside of trade negotiations. So, it appears to be kind of a a political football going back and forth. But I'm curious why this is so top of mind for you. We very rarely have consensus amongst all politicians on any item. And this is one other than spending money like drunken sailors. And this was one where they all agreed like this is a threat to America.\n\nUm and there were a bunch of people who were saying like you're hysterical. It's not a threat. Um and very clearly is. They've been caught multiple times stealing consumer data, tracking journalists. The reports from inside of it is that you know they're slow rolling um you know the data rules that they've been given. And um you know the Chinese government essentially owns every company in China and they have the ability to have a golden share and be on the board. Putting aside why Trump has extended it now 3 days, Jeff Yas making big donations, all of that, you know, you can have all your criticism that this administration and the last were pay to play. If you make a donation you get what you want. Um, politics has always unfortunately in the US had that, you know, um, aspect to what we do and I think it should change, but hey, here we are. I don't know if that's going to change. What's interesting about this is the fact that it's become part of the overall trade deal.\n\nWhat that should tell you is that this is a foreign asset. The fact that China will make this a key part of trade is that it's important to them to spy on us. I am 100% certain with zero evidence but just my gut and number of years on the planet. I believe the Chinese government is using that software to read the phones of children of important people to hack into people's phones to hack into people's data to know their location and to feed that into their version of Palunteer and we are idiots for allowing them to do so. In India, they just banned like on mass a dozen or two dozen of these Chinese apps. They were like, \"Yeah, that makes no sense that you can track our citizens at scale. No, get out. Just no. It's, you know, it's not personal, but reciprocity, we don't have it.\" So, now that this has been put into that, just pause everybody.\n\nYou know, first principles thinking, why won't the Chinese spin this out and let it go? Why are they holding on to this like it's a it's like they're nukes? Because it's more powerful than nuclear bombs. This is more powerful than nuclear bombs. They could get compromant on Trump, you know, on Nancy Pelosi. They could have hacked AOC's phone. They could have hacked all of their children's and grandchildren's phone and have compromises.\n\nAnd if you're wondering if that's at all possible or in the realm of possibility, the Israelis just did it in Iran where they were tracking people because of their WhatsApp app. It's an app. WhatsApp is an app. They were tracking. They've hacked those people's phones and they literally sent drones in to kill them. Mhm. This is not science fiction. This is the reality of what this technology enables.\n\nThe Chinese could come in and assassinate 100 people deafly using Tik Tok data. I am certain. I recently joined Tik Tok again because my boss asked me to. Um but what I'm really what I really is a jerk. that lawn. Oh, I wasn't I wasn't dug. Um, what's what's interesting to me is how much perspectives here have changed. And again, not trying to get political, but the bill in question passed the House by a vote of 360 to 58. It passed the Senate 79-18, which is an enormous majority for the American Congress. And it did seem like the technology industry was somewhat unified on the points that you're taking. Now it feels much more mealy mouththed, much more well free market. I is the shift just people's political allegiances coming into the White House and therefore them following the leader here or is there a counterargument that we should take into account as we consider the next 90-day pause in this uh span? I mean, listen, it's all a raw shock test now. If Trump's your guy and you voted for him like the majority of the country did, you think this is for DHS and he's awesome at it. So therefore, part of the deal, he's going to figure it all out. if you are the minority of the country that you know didn't vote for him uh and uh you don't like him and think he's a dictator and that there's too much grifting going on yada yada you think that this is all some way for him to enrich himself personally uh and so the truth is probably the people who are major shareholders in Tik Tok have his ear and they can make very convincing arguments he wants to do this grand reconciliation with them. I was talking with three last night I had a conversation with three of the top Chinese entrepreneurs in the world. Mhm. The top top top of the top and we had a discussion about how the United States and China and the people of both these countries truly want to work together and we need to turn it around. So literally at this little conference and you know commerce you know we have two governments that are seemingly always at each other's throats and somebody said you know this is all about Taiwan you I said what is this about pretty much about Taiwan little bit about the trade stuff and\n\n\nMaking money from each other, and there are trust issues and whatever. I said, what's the solution for Taiwan? I kind of like the ambiguity we had before. Like, Taiwan's an amazing country, and these people are amazing, and they're a great part of China. It's like, wait, that's two different things. Are they a country or are they part of China? It's like, yes. Yes. Yes. To which one? Just dodging bullets here. Yeah. They're an incredible part of China, and they're very proud people and have a great country. The end. You know, like that that worked so well. And a tolerance for ambiguity is just so important when you're trying to get along with people, right? Not everybody's perfect or fits into your mold. Um, somebody said, \"Why don't they just give a hundred-year guarantee like the Hong Kong thing? In a 100 years, Taiwan will be part of China.\" Like, in a hundred years, like maybe that's the best way to avoid World War II is just to come up with like a, you know, hundred-year timetable, like kick it out. Like, and you know, Hong Kong is part of China now, and Hong Kong is still independent and has its own sovereignty and like 80% of what they do, and okay, it seems to have worked out better than a war for Hong Kong.\n\nAll right, Jason, we need to go uh talk to a founder. It's about time we did that. And today we are going to talk to uh Rishab Gupta from Actuality. You may know him from the ninth founder university cohort and the 34th launch accelerator group. He is the man behind Actuality. I think it's a really cool company. I was just looking at it earlier today. Welcome to the show. Good to see you again. And uh so you went through our founder university program in the ninth cohort and uh launch accelerate 34, which is going on right now. You're in week eight, seven or eight. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so tell uh everybody in the audience or show us what you're building and why it's important. Absolutely. So um my name is Rishab, and I'm uh I'm co-founder and CEO of Actuality. At Actuality, we are building an RFP response platform specifically for the construction industry. We use AI to automate RFPs essentially. Um, the why it is important, most construction companies have to respond to a bunch of RFPs to to like, you know, bid on projects and get get sales. Uh, and responding to these RFPs is time-consuming and resource-intensive, often taking more than 200 hours, $12,000 to respond to just one RFP, and many times they don't respond to more than 50% of eligible RFPs out out there. So so just it's it's a great idea to streamline that so that they can respond to more RFPs and and without increasing headcount. That's the essential idea. It's an idea that's going to help people do more with less. They're going to be able to respond to more RFPs, which means they're going to get more work. The quality of the RFPs, the quality of the bids will be better. The win rate will be better. Yeah. And it'll be cheaper. So, you've made something better, faster, cheaper.\nYes. Absolutely. Yes. Um and uh and and like the the customers are loving it. Like, you know, some we have we started working on this in November of 2025, uh 2024. So since then, we have like an onboarded six design partners, uh one of them started paying us, uh and and they're loving it. Like uh they they're using it on a regular basis. Uh one cool thing recently, they came back to us and they said their customers told them uh that this is one of the best responses response they have seen in many years. uh because it was very personalized, like you know what ends up happening is people uh use templates and they just like, you know, fill in their data from previous RFPs, but using AI, everything gets very personalized and very uh like for the actual the the bit they're responding to. So hallucinations, making sure you don't overpromise in an RFP or make a mistake, this is critically important. So what is your instruction to your customers in terms of best practices and how you know you obviously could just start firing things off and flood people, and some people are doing stuff like this. I get pitched all the time on people who are like, we'll make a thousand literal a thousand clips, you know, with AI from your podcast. We'll put you know, 10 bucks behind each one. We'll tell you which ones work. We'll get a m, and I'm like, that sounds like spam. And they're like, no. So yeah, maybe so what is the current state of affairs, you know, how much time do people have to put into polishing them, checking them, and what are your instructions to customers? And then the follow-up to that, obviously, is how is that progressing? If it was going to get better, at what pace would it be better, and to the point at which there would be no changes needed or virtually no changes? Our responses when we started working on this initially, they were like, you know, 80, 85% accurate, but over the over the past 6 months, once they have got into a point where they're 90 to 95% accurate. The way we are selling this to our customers is we are saying that it is a co-pilot, like you know, it would create the first draft. You have to like, you know, it's your responsibility to go through it, check each each and every item on this uh because like from liability perspective, we want to shield ourselves and and and this is a revenue-generating uh document, directly affecting the revenue. So we want to be mindful of that. Us, one of our customers, like actually, like you know, all of our customers came back to us and said we they're spending right now, they're spending approximately five to eight hours every time like reviewing the RFPs uh and and that's a lot. Uh so so we we we want to like, you know, closing the gap from 85 to 95 was uh was like okay, like I would say easy, not easy, but like you know, uh but 95 to 100 is going to be difficult, and it it is difficult.\nUh so my question here, Jason, is uh I I read a read a like, you know, article from uh Paul Graham saying that do things that don't scale. Uh so I was wondering like, you know, would it be a good idea to to probably like have from someone from our team at least like, you know, doing something for them included within the cost for each piece for now. 100%. Yeah. Human in the loop is a great idea.\nThe product Grammarly, which I'm addicted to, had a feature early on that they've deprecated where you could write in Grammarly and then you could press a button and have a human editor review it remote. And you know, this was crowdsourcing or, you know, virtual work, mechanical turk back in the day. We had a bunch of different ways of phrasing it, but you know, a little reinforcement learning or human in the loop here would go a long way, I think. And I think they'd be happy to pay for it. You could make it a feature, not a bug, which is would you like to pay for a human to review this draft or you could just absorb the cost yourself and consider that R&D\nand um have that person, you know, training the AI and saying you got this wrong, this could have been better, this was good, this is great, and just explaining to them what's good and great. And um depending on the sophistication of your customer, you could let them know that you're doing that, not let them know. Um I wouldn't, you know, if you're raising money and you present this to shareholders, uh future shareholders, you do have to make sure that you're clear with them what AI does and what humans do it. There was a company, they were, I think, having a bunch of people in India write code in the co-pilot. So people thought they were had a coding co-pilot, and it was actually just really brilliant Indian engineers.\nNow, okay, points for creativity, but yeah, not cool. Um, and could lead over in the UK that had 700 engineers that were fake AI and uh didn't go well in the end. Yeah. Now, hiring those people to do reinforcement learning, awesome. So, you know, you could when I did Grammarly, it was they were explicit about it because people know what a copyright is. I'm curious, what is a person who responds to RFP called? Is that a specific title in the world? Uh, it's RFP uh RFP manager or RFP specialist. These are the two titles.\nYeah. Which is the higher title? Manager, like you know uh yeah, proposal manager is another one, like people call them. Uh so what is the junior person called? Specialist. Okay, perfect. Proposal specialist. So I think you know actually your RFP specialist, your AI RFP specialist, you could present it as we are going to be the specialist, but you still have to manage it, and then you could hire a manager\nuh to be part of the stack. So we have managers available to polish this for you. Would you like that for $200 per unit? Are you charging people per seat, per unit, per co-pilot? How are you charging right now? What's the experimentation like? So, so we are charging based on per RFP. Um, perfect. I I was from this industry. Most platforms charge per se, but I think like you know per charging per RFP is a better way to do that. Uh, yeah. Like you know we can we can increase we can say like extra 200 bucks will get you human reviewing it. So you would save 8 hours. Rishop, I'm really curious about the verticality of this product because I did not know about the architecture, engineering, and construction or AEC sector until I was literally prepping to have you on the show. So my question is, has the technology that you've built to handle RFPs in that particular industry, does it translate to other sectors or is there a lot of backend work to get the right data pipelines in place that would make it hard to kind of copy and then paste this into a different vertical?\nThere there are a few companies which are already doing a good job of like you know servicing other industries, but there are not many companies which are doing a good job specifically for the AEC industry, and the reason for that is uh is that the tech stack for the construction folks a folks is very different from like you know rest of the companies. Uh they don't integrate with softwares like Procore, they don't have the ability to read architecture drawings, all these kind of things, these are the these are the things which we are building and we want to specialize in, and that is why we have chosen is vertical rather than like you know going horizontal to to to service many many industries. The other big difference is uh the way this whole industry works is many many uh people within the sector, like an architect would form a syndicate with a general contractor to collaborate together to bid on a bigger RFP. Uh so that type of collaboration is not allowed in many of the other tools. So we are we are building those subcontractor collaboration workflows uh which is very unique uh to us. Oh well that's awesome. So the answer is not particularly copy pasteable, but also there's good alternatives elsewhere, but you're solving a harder problem, and that'll form a nice moat around the company. Exactly. And that's that's exactly uh the the idea. Well now I know why Jason invested in you. That sounds that sounds great. 10 points. Yeah. So I used to respond to a bunch of RFPs. Uh I have responded to more than 100 RFPs within the AC sector. So, and we tried using all some of the existing tools, but none of them work. So, that prompted me to like, you know, work on this. Got it. This is going to be a great business. Is there any way I can be more helpful? Uh, anything you're struggling with? Obviously, a lot of uh firms in your stage were in accelerator looking to fund raise. I'm sure you're going to crush it in fundraising. Um, and I don't know if uh we've introduced you to VCs, but uh I'm curious how the fundraising is going or if you're think considering a fund raise. Um, and then also on that, I'm curious um if you have any questions for me or things I can be helpful with.\nYeah, so fundraising is going well. We have already started forming good relationships with a bunch of VCs through your like, you know, network. Jason, thank you so much for that. Um, and and we are like holding off a little bit. We we we have started building a relationships there. There are a couple of customers, couple of design partners who are about to become paid. So once that happens in the next couple of months, that's when we like you know uh go will go full throttle and and fund raise. That's the idea. Um on the other side, like you know, from from we we do we we are facing a little bit of a dilemma uh regarding product side of things. So some of our C between like how to prioritize, I would love some help uh how to prioritize between um data privacy uh building new features or like increasing the accuracy of the responses. This was my question for you, but we already talked about accuracy uh but like you know how do we how do we how do I prioritize that? So your customers care about the proprietariness of what they're doing and they really want privacy. They bring it up. Yes, they bring it up. Everyone does it. some more than others. So we are working with a really big multi-billion dollar company, for example, they do 6,000 RFPs a year. Uh so on on a last call, they said is there a way that we can deploy it on prem. So yeah. Okay. So yeah. So this is I think the enterprise version is how most people do this, and it's contact us for pricing for enterprise, and it just is at a different rate. It's a much bigger rate. It's at a six figure per year rate, and so you should really explain like how much extra work that is, and you know, you're giving up the reinforcement learning, but we understand that's key. There are people, you know, I now pay uh because I needed to have security for, you know, as a finance firm, you know, so now we can for Google docs, for Slack, we pay for higher versions of this specifically to have access to APIs or specifically to have like backups of everything or monitoring of everything. If you like have the standard Gmail as an employer, you can't search through all the emails in your organization, but you can like I guess change somebody's password and then go individually and search in it. You work at a bank and you need to know if somebody's talking to this person or there was fraud going on or somebody did something inappropriate. You have to search all emails for compliance reasons. That's like that's not $8 a person, $50 a year. Now you're at, you know, $300 a year. So look at the pricing Slack\nand uh Google Docs charge for it's like super enterprise. And you can probably find that by talking to an LLM about like what is the pricing and what are\n\n\nThe features. But those, and the way to sort of back into it is look at the compliance industry in finance because they have the most acute. The government forces them to keep all communications, like because if you were to make banks, Goldman Sachs, trading desks, they need to have every phone call recorded, every trade, every trade recorded to make sure they didn't like sell somebody something they didn't. And if somebody says, \"I didn't buy that.\" You know, when they're on the trading desk and everybody's ordering, they have the recording of it, and they're like, \"Well, here's I can play back the recording for like all records are all phone calls on the trading desk are recorded, every text. So make sure they're not doing insider trading, all that compliance work. So compliance is a way for you to understand how to charge because it's very similar to that, and I think it will be analogous in our industry is people are willing to pay. I'm going to think it's four times as much, three times as much, I don't know what the multiplier is, but I think it'll be four times as much to have that, and then on-prem might be, you know, 10 times as much if you want that privilege of we're going to run our software in the cloud for you, and this thing again as an entrepreneur, you only have so much work you can do. So the version that's cheap, we get the reinforcement learning. The version where we don't get the reinforcement learning, you know, and we don't even see what you're doing, that could be a different price. Okay. And 10 times more that I, I would have never imagined, but like, you know, thank you. Thank you for uh telling me that. Great job. Uh and I can't wait to see you in person. I'll see you at the graduation, demo days, barbecue, everything. All right, everybody. This has been Thank you so much, Alex. Yeah. Thanks for coming on.
